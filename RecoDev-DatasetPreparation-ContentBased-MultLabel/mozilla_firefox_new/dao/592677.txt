No Padding Between Toolbars

This should block. It looks broken right now because there isn't any space between them. Adding some bottom padding to the navigation bar is probably fairly easy.

patch

Tweaked some selectors while I was at it. browser.js sets the inFullscreen attribute on all fullscreen toolbars.
It it just a mistake that you're removing the :not([inFullscreen="true"]) for the #PersonalToolbar border-radius rules?
#PersonalToolbar won't have that attribute since it lacks fullscreentoolbar="true".
