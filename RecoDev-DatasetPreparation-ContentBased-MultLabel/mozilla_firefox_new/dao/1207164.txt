Apparently this was a measurable perf win:

Improvement: Fx-Team-Non-PGO - Talos Page Switch - Ubuntu HW 12.04 x64 - 3.98% decrease
Improvement: Fx-Team-Non-PGO - Talos Page Switch - Ubuntu HW 12.04 - 4.82% decrease

Looking at the graph, it looks like a genuine win rather than just undoing a regression from bug 1201442.
