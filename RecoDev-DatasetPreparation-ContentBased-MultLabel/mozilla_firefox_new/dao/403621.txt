Please drop these function()->function () changes.
I've certainly seen both styles; I think omitting the space is more common, but is there a reason for that?

I tend to add the space because of this:

"If a function literal is anonymous, there should be one space between the word function and the ( (left parenthesis). If the space is omited, then it can appear that the function's name is function, which is an incorrect reading." (http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)

asking for approval. Besides the cosmetic changes, this fixes some ArrayEnumerator constructors that didn't eliminate empty elements reliably. As far as I know, that bug didn't cause problems so far, but it should be fixed in any case.
