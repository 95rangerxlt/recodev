The Firefox Menu Button doesn't have Character Encoding menu, so, we cannot change the page's encoding to right one when Fx failed to detect the right one.
FYI: There is bug 63054, so, if we don't want to add them to the Firefox Menu Button, now might be good chance designing new UI.

Same problem when changing encoding of Page Source
Blocking for at least a decision/resolution. I'm pretty sure we don't want the charset selector in the firefox menu, but I don't know what the solution is for when we get it wrong.
Note that the old menubar is still available if you press F10 or Alt. Unfortunately, not many people seem to know that.
Limi/Faaborg: can we get a decision as asked for in comment 3? Do we want to selectively show the character encoding menuItem for locales which need it more than others (which tends to be the Asian ones, from what I can tell)
Default placement is in the developer menu, locals can opt to move it to the overflow extension area so that it is directly in the main menu:

That sounds reasonable - is that where it is in beta3? I'm happy to move this to a b4 blocker that depends on some bug implementing the changes to the Firefox menu, but don't want to let this slip out of view.
>That sounds reasonable - is that where it is in beta3?

As far as I can tell the Firefox menu isn't actively being worked on at the moment.  If the freeze is monday, we are looking at beta 4.
Not sure that Limi is the best assignee for this bug.
I'm would like to dupe this change forward to bug 583386 so that we can centralize discussion, work, and blocking status for beta 4.

I'm keeping this bug separate for now since it already has blocking status. When bug 583386 picks up blocking, we might just do all of the changes over there.

It has blocking, so duping forward.

Bug 583386 was fixed but there is still no character encoding menu in Firefox button.

That was because the coder couldn't figure out how the code worked for this.  I tried to help him and also could not figure it out.
If a page doesn't tell its encoding by HTTP header or <meta>, we need to guess the right encoding by the binary pattern. Of course, that must be sometimes wrong. Then, users need to change the encoding manually.

And also, if a page tell wrong encoding, then, users need to change the encoding manually too.

Such pages are not major in current Web. However, it's not zero. So, if mismatch of encoding happens (that is called Mojibake in Japan, the term is very popular including light users) and there is no UI for changing the encoding, that makes serious a11y problem.

Yes, there are specific locales where this problem is more pronounced than others. Those locales could have the character menu as a top-level option.

there will be a UI, this bug is blocking+

So, do you mean that the character encoding menu should be displayed only on some locales? If so, we should have a new hidden pref for displaying them forcibly. Nightly builds, some Alphas, and early Betas are not localized. So, testers and developers in such locales need to display the menus on En-US build too.
Every local will have access to character encoding through the developer menu.  We would like to introduce a pref for locales to opt in to additionally displaying it directly in the main menu itself as well.
This bug is currently assigned to Limi, but I'm pretty sure he's not going to be introducing this preference. Who's doing that work?
>Who's doing that work?

Johnath: this bug could use an owner
Given that this is an open beta 4 blocker, and it obviously missed beta 4, shouldn't it now be moved to being a beta 6 blocker? (It's not showing up in the blocking queries at the moment).
Yes. I'm also just going to assign it so someone, eenie meenie miney Margaret!
Okay. Do I just need to add the character encoding menu to the developer menu? Or should I also introduce the pref to display it directly in the main menu, and if so, where in the main menu should it go?

I added the "character encoding" menu at the bottom of the developer menu, below "work offline." Is that where we want it?

Also, I implemented the change by copying the xul from browser/base/content/browser-menubar.inc, but I noticed that there's an overlay in toolkit (toolkit/content/charsetOverlay.xul), so should I try using that instead?

Here is a link to iteration 6 of the Firefox button where Alex has it like:

-------------
View Page Source
-------------
Character Encoding
-------------
Work Offline

I corrected the ordering of the menu, and I created a browser-charsetmenu.inc file to factor out the character encoding menu code.

Fix that. Also this file has been infected with tabs, fix that too :)

This also got tabbed.

How are we going to deal with accesskeys? They should be visible in the main menu, but we don't use them in Firefox menu.
alt = normal menu
alt-f = focused firefox menu (planned), followed by arrow key access to the sub-menu.
Maybe I wasn't clear enough - I meant we should display accesskeys in the main menu (on particular platforms), but we shouldn't display them in the Firefox menu. As the code for populating the Character encoding submenu is shared, we are currently displaying them in both main and Firefox menu.
That means as of now the Character encoding is the only submenu in the new Firefox Menu having the accesskey displayed. And that's pretty inconsistent - either every Firefox menu item should have an accesskey or there should be no accesskeys at all.
You can file a new bug to cover the inconsistency. (It would be kind of annoying to fix, and I don't think it's a blocking issue.)
