patch

The current class names (textbox-presentation-*) are neither very clear nor generic enough, given that the formatted URL stuff could become a separate binding for use outside of a textbox. I'd like to address this before others start adopting their themes.

The patch also fixes a bug in the stylesheets (.textbox-presentation-slash doesn't exist anymore).

Btw, this fix is needed to make hideProtocols work properly.

Shouldn't these both be "rtl"?

This also made me realize that we don't support RTL in pinstripe, so we should probably file a bug on removing the rtl rules you added there. Or you can do it here if you want.

Nope, subdomain needs text-align:right for ltr / left for rtl, port needs text-align:left for ltr / right for rtl.

I didn't know that. I'll update the patch.
