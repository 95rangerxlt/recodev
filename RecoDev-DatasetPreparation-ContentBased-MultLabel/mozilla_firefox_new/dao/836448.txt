browser-data-submission-info-bar.js does a couple of things as if it didn't share the scope with lots of other chrome JS:

- it adds its own license header that ends up in the middle of browser.js
- it attempts to enable strict mode (I believe this doesn't work, since it ends up not being at the top of browser.js)
- it imports resource://services-common/log4moz.js into the global scope
- it exposes a redundant DataNotificationInfoBar object

Well, I tried to catch this in bug 804745 comment 25, but I guess we forgot to remove the global import() call :( We were in a bit of a hurry... Thanks for following up.

Greg and I had discussed using a singleton vs. a constructor function, and Greg had some arguments about not liking singletons in general, related to them making testing and re-usability harder. In looking back at it I don't think those really apply here, though, and this code is simpler this way.
