  Is it possible to set minimal width like it is in Chrome (~340px)?
  Dynamic width is very annoying...

Looks like something like this does the trick (should be merged, replace left:auto, etc.):

statuspanel,
statuspanel:-moz-locale-dir(ltr)[mirror],
statuspanel:-moz-locale-dir(rtl):not([mirror]) {
  min-width: 400px; // More? Less?
}

.statuspanel-inner {
  width: 100%;
}

Yes, this is exactly what I want to see. It's much better now :)

This starts with a 25% min-width and lets the statuspanel grow but not shrink for value changes, until the value gets reset.

When I was playing with this in userChrome.css I needed to specify min-width for these two selectors explicitly, apparently to override the "left: auto". I wonder if you need that here too.

Not "25%"?

I don't think so, this seemed to work just fine.

"" resets the style attribute, causing the min-width as specified in the stylesheet to be used.

Awesome. I'll try this patch and see what happens here.

Right, duh.

Yep, works. I forgot to test removing the additional min-width after I added the width: 100% to .statuspanel-inner.

r=jag if you want it.
So, can someone approve it please?
This might not show up in the "approval?" queries due to an open "review?".

Gavin, wanna have a quick look?
I need to update this for bug 541656.
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2f353922a56c

Bug 541656 added statuspanel { -moz-transition: opacity 100ms ease-out }, so other than merging, I added statuspanel[label=""] { -moz-transition: none } so that the statuspanel fades in when it gets a label but not out when it loses the label. Without the min-width it didn't fade out either, as it would immediately shrink to width 0 without a label.


Set min-width on statuspanel for less jitter
