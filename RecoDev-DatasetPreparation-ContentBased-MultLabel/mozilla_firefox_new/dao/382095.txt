both directories contain some obsolete files as well as some files in use. all files in use should be copied into the places dir, and all obsolete files removed from the places dir. old /bookmarks files should remain for in place for non-places bookmarks builds.

Despite having had the email from this starred in my bugspam folder for almost a year, I wound up doing the last bit of consolidate and remove /bookmarks/ in bug 424613, so now I'm desperately searching for something obsolete in /places/ besides the venerable placesIcon.png, so I don't have to *just* kill the goldfish blowing a bubble here.

Fix v.1

Plenty o' review, so I don't kill something you're planning on bringing back next week, but these are the things that don't show any sign of being used.
notice that new icons has been landed to be used soon (bug 429282) but are still unused.

for example calendar.png will be soon used for day containers, so you should not remove it

Fix v.1

Sigh. And libraryNavigation.png was pre-landed for bug 428924. Among the many things we've tried that don't entirely work out, I'd list this "land icons by the gobful" technique. (And "use a different filename for the very same thing on different platforms," too.)

Fix v.2

Quite a bit less - since calendar.png and libraryNavigation.png have uses coming, collapse.png and expand.png might (I'll brace faaborg about them separately), and I really hope pinstripe's starPage.png is going to, we're down to:

pinstripe:
* infoPaneGrippy.png went away with bug 403140
* contentSplitter-bg.gif would have, except it seems to have landed unused
* folderDropHoverArrow.png is the white dropmarker, from back when hovered bookmark folders had such a dark background it needed to be white
* menubutton-mid.png must have been from some plan that involved stretching, which isn't currently being used
* the tabs in the plus and minus lines give me a rash
* poor old placesIcon.png needs to be put out to pasture

winstripe
* poor old placesIcon.png lost his identity, getting turned into a star, so he really needs to be put out to pasture

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
