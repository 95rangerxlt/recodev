When xul:checkboxes are used in xhtml docs they are rendered incorrectly
Created attachment 571280
Patch used to reproduce the problem

To reproduce:
1. Go to the web console (Firefox -> Web Developer -> Web Console)
2. Enter "inspectstyle(document.body)"

The style inspector will appear with a xul:checkbox from the land of ugly (see attached image).

Clicking the checkbox, which looks more like a text field, does nothing.

Isn't that checkbox there this one:

+        <input class="onlyuserstyles" save="${onlyUserStylesCheckbox}"
+               type="checkbox" onchange="${onlyUserStylesChanged}" checked=""/>

?  If so, that's an html:input, not a xul:checkbox, unless I'm seriously missing something....

lol ... I attached the wrong patch. It is reproducible with this one.
That last patch doesn't apply to m-c.  On m-c there is no <xul:hbox class="header" flex="1"> or <xul:textarea>.  Instead there is a <div class="filters"> and an HTML <input>.

-.onlyuserstyles,
-.userStylesLabel {
+.onlyuserstyles {

not a fan of this capitalization (would prefer onlyUserStyles).

but here we are.

So is there still a core rendering issue I should be worried about here?
