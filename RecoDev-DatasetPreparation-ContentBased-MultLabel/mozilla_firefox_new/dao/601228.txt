Screenshot from latest nightly after restarting
I will need to try to see if I can reproduce this again as it has been intermittent. I have seen it on my Mac laptop but not using any of the QA lab machines.
For me this seems to happen after session restore, and is most easily reproduced with Gmail pinned. I just was able to reproduce this with a clean profile.

STR:
1. Open a tab with Gmail in it. Pin it.
2. Open a tab with Google calendar. Don't pin it.
3. Restart Firefox.
4. Observe that the tabs overlap.
Probably a dupe of Bug 579869

Bug 579869 was fixed months ago. This is a regression and we need a regression range.

> Paul: Are you running with any extensions?

dom inspector 2.0.8, https everywhere 0.2.3.development.1,  flashblock 1.5.14.2
I have the following installed:
*Instant Preview1falseinstant.preview@agadak.net
*Add-on Compatibility Reporter0.7falsecompatibility@addons.mozilla.org
*Firebug1.5.4falsefirebug@software.joehewitt.com
*NoScript2.0.4false{73a6fe31-595d-460b-a920-fcc0f8843232}
*Adblock Plus1.2.2false{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}

In the profile I can consistently repro the issue using today's nightly, even if I launch Minefield in safe mode.

I have tried with a clean profile but I cannot yet reproduce it on the latest trunk or on earlier builds.
This is not Mac specific, it happens on Windows too, see Bug 601930 which is the same AFAICS.

STR from bug 601930:
1. Start Minefield with new profile
2. Open 2 browser windows.
3. Open a AppTab and a regular tab in each window.
4. Alt > File > Exit, Choose "Save and Quit" on Quit Minefield dialog.
5. Start Browser again

Actual Results:
 AppTab overlaps "regular" tab on the Tab Bar in one of the restored windows.

Expected Results:
 Should not.

I will try to locate a regression range over the weekend.
Regression range on Windows:
works	2010-09-14-04	http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5588c9796f0b

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=5588c9796f0b&tochange=0caec4ddff74

This is using the STR of comment 10 on Windows 7, it would be helpful if someone with access to a Mac can verify if this is the same range, then we can be sure this and bug 601930 are the same.

Seem to be the case for OS X too. Nothing in there seems very suspicious. The closest would be bug 593967. There was a TM merge in there too, but that doesn't seem likely.

Could somebody who's able to reproduce this try to find the first bad changeset using hg bisect?

Thanks. Unfortunately, I don't see yet what the problem with the patch from bug 593967 might be. (Also, I still haven't seen this happen with various profiles on Win XP / 7 / Linux.)

Umm I can 100% repro:
Windows7 Classic , Aero Basic and Aero.
WindowsXP Classic and Luna.
Ubuntu8.04 Human.
After restoring window, 
As a matter of course, execute the following code, then the position of the tab becomes normal.
document.getElementById("tabbrowser-tabs")._positionPinnedTabs();

Does this help?

Nothing changed.
"transitionend" event does not fire while restoring window.
However pinTab is called the number of times of the app tab while restoring window.

WORKAROUND:
      <method name="pinTab">
        <parameter name="aTab"/>
        <body><![CDATA[
          if (aTab.pinned)
            return;

          if (aTab.hidden)
            this.showTab(aTab);

          this.moveTabTo(aTab, this._numPinnedTabs);
          aTab.setAttribute("pinned", "true");
-         this.tabContainer._positionPinnedTabs();
+         //xxx width of aTab is not changed immediately
+         setTimeout(function(self){self.tabContainer._positionPinnedTabs();},0, this);
          this.tabContainer.adjustTabstrip();
I know it's hard going trying to track this down, but we need to understand and fix it.

Dao, is there anything else Alice can give you to help chase this? Any chance there's localstore strangeness in her profile, any chance your profile has stuff in it that is preventing you from reproducing the problem?
fwiw, 100% reproducible here for me too on OSX & Win7, new & existing profiles. I don't see it during a normal session restore, but it always see it after restoring a recently closed window.

Dao - let me know if you need me to try anything if you still can't reproduce.
I see it when restoring a recently closed window indeed.

hack to prevent the bug

For some reason the favicon doesn't take up any space initially, although width:16px is applied. This patch works around the issue but shouldn't be needed. Seems to be a layout bug so far.

I haven't tested the patch on OS X, the min-width might be off there.
In _positionPinnedTabs, the computed CSS visibility of the favicon is "collapse" when the bug occurs, but nothing seems to be setting that...
As expected it's "visible" when the bug doesn't occur.
It's not clear to me what was going on here, but bug 582950 appears to have fixed it.

It hid the issue via bug 614290, which is fixed now, exposing this bug again.

I figure this needs to be a hard blocker.

patch

This "fixes" the issue by not positioning app tabs when the tab bar doesn't overflow. This is really a workaround as far as this bug is concerned, but one we would want to apply anyway since it avoids doing unnecessary work.

Depends on the current patch in bug 617506.

patch

Stealing review. *yoink*

Looks fine, but one minor style this you may or may not want to make... _positionPinnedTabs is a bit hard to read through because there are so many things conditional on |doPosition|. I tried quickly refactoring so just split everything into a single |if (doPosition) { ... } else { ... }|. Seems a little easier to follow, at the cost of duplicating the (trivial) for-loop.

See http://pastebin.mozilla.org/949280

r+ either way.

Is anyone else experienced this using Win32 Nightly build 20110117 Firefox/4.0b10pre?

Screenshots: http://i54.tinypic.com/2n1ryao.jpg
http://i54.tinypic.com/ajqno9.jpg

App Tab (Pin Tab) more than one tab then Unpin one of them and the other App Tabs become non-visible and part of the Unpined Tab is cut off, this happens using the default theme or with a Personas theme applied. Didn't happen on Win32 Nightly build 20110116 Firefox/4.010pre.

Maybe a regression since this bug landed: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=601228

Please confirm if you can...
Thanks... :D
