Sigh. I wish we didn't support the button on Windows XP.

Shorlander: are you tracking this?
May I ask why this is supported on XP?(In reply to comment #1)

May I ask why this is supported on XP? It looks really strange to have a menu button on the title bar. The menus are already shown by default so I don't really see the point with having this on XP.

see XP's mockup "Large Button Mode with Firefox Button".
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups#Windows_XP
Yes, looks like it should be much taller, almost the same size as the caption buttons.

Firefox 4 button fitted for WinXP

I have a feedback about the Firefox button on Windows XP, because
nightlies after nightlies, I start to believe something has not been taken in
account.

According the mockups, the button should be like this : 
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups#Large_Button_Mode_with_Firefox_Button

IMO the aim of this mockup is not to show the button should be enlargen, it is
to focus on the fact that it should _fit_ the OS, ie the Firefox button should
just look like the close/minimize/maximize buttons and should not touch the top
edge of the title bar (look attachement to see my point)

Therefore, the button should also be different on Win XP w/ classic theme, and
on WinVista without aero.

If UI developpements still continue in this direction, there will be
inconsistencies on other systems than Win7, because currently the button just
fits this OS.
Hacking title bar is not usual on XP themes, therefore it should be done
wisely.


Please tell me what you think of this, and if it is doable for 4.0.


[Firefox Button] need more height (Windows XP)
