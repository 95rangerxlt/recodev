Actual results:

Unable to recall my password, I requested a reset from Hurricane Electric's tunnelbroker.net page. When I accessed the https address they provided via email I recieved Firefox's "untrusted site" page. I could only keyboard to the "get me out of here" button. I couldn't keyboard to a button that would allow me to continue to connect. Fortunately for me, I was able to use lynx to solve this problem, but I should have been able to use FF, as I have always done in the past. This seems new with FF6. I'm on Fedora 15 with AT-SPI2 and Orca, so must be able to keyboard. Mouse is impossible for me.

Janina, by 'to keyboard' you means tabbing, virtual buffer navigation or something else?
Yes, tabbing. Orca doesn't have a virtual buffer.

then it's keyboard navigation bug I think
Still an issue with latest nightly. Confirming
Hi, I need to confirm this is still a bug. I'm currently at IBM in Austin in a W3C Face to Face. It seems the SSL cert for the IBMVISITOR wifi service has expired, so triggers the "untrusted site" screen. I can only TAB to "GET ME OUT OF HERE." i ASKED ONE OF MY COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES TO MOUSE TO "cONTINUE ANYWAY," OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED. tHEREAFTER, EVERYTHING WORKS ok. bUT, BY MYSELF, i'D HAVE BEEN FULLY BLOCKED AT THAT POINT.
Enn, Mats, a tabbing issue. Would you please take a look?
Nothing to do with either of us. The dialog has some poorly designed expander widgets that aren't accessible.

Hi, looks like this revision regressed https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/290d329672e5 . Only the h2 is removed now, instead of the whole expert content.

Sorry if I'm not supposed to comment a fixed bug.
