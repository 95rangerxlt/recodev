code cleanup:  remove <xul:hbox style="position: relative;"> from tabbrowser.xml and pinstripe/global/globalBindings.xml

it looks like roc has a fix, and once it lands (on trunk and/or branch) I can clean up this hack

patch, remove my hack now that roc has fixed bug #346035
Does this bug refer to the spacer box below scrollbutton-down?

From what I understand, once this bug is fixed, the box will no longer be present, such that if .scrollbutton-down is set to "display:none", then this space will be freely available to tabs, correct?

Also, does this spacer have a fixed width, or can its width be manually altered?

The reason I ask this is because if I could place a spacer there where this hbox resides that gave me the ability to manually select its width in pixels, then when I have removed scrollbutton-up and scrollbutton-down, I could correct for the offset problem that occurs when you have a set of fixed width 250 pixel tabs scrolled all the way to the left and all the way to the right, allowing for the close buttons on each tab to always be in the same constant place.

If the current hbox is removed, it would be nice to have the ability to add back some sort of  spacer there that can have its width controlled manually to correct for tab width disparity whenever the scrollbuttons are removed.
On further consideration of my previous message, a spacer is probably not best way of going about fixing this disparity.  Instead, choosing the appropriate width for each tab that is cleanly divisible into the full width of the tab bar, setting maxwidth and minwidth to correspond to this number, and removing .tabs-left and .scrollbutton-down-stack, is probably the best solution to the problem, and off-hand it seems to all be doable by editing userChrome.css.  I will keep my eyes peeled to the result of fixing this bug, however.
Seth, you need to ask review on the patch, not?
Bug 360474 mentions that there is also some code in the winstripe globalBindings.xml that can be removed.
sorry for the bug spam, re-assigning bugs back to default owner if I'm not working actively on them.

Thanks dao for fixing this.  The less "XXXsspitzer hack" in the tree, the better!
