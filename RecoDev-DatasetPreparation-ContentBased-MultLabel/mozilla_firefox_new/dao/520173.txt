Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to http://getpersonas.com/
2. Hover over a persona to trigger the in-browser preview
3. Without mousing out, put focus into the address bar and type an off-site URL (mozilla.com, etc.)

Expected:
The personas preview reverts to the previously applied persona (or the default)

Actual results:
The preview persona sticks and becomes the current default.

I don't know if there's a way to remove the preview when the page unloads, but if so, we should probably add this just to avoid confusion.

Moving bugs necessary for 3.6 to new milestone.
There's already bug 486207 on changing the web site.  But I think Firefox should enforce this, rather than relying on the web site to be perfect.
I agree.
