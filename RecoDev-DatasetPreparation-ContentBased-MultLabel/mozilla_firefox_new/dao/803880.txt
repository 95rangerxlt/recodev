image showing the separator and hovered button state

We've got a vertical separator line between each of the buttons in the social toolbar. When you hover over one of the buttons, the button border on the left side overlaps the separator and the effect is a slightly darkened left border. That's not terribly ugly, but the right border is another story. The right border looks doubled up, two pixels wide, because the button's hovered border is one pixel off from the vertical separator's dark line. 

If we can make the hover state's right border overlap the separator line like the left border does, that could mask this hack a bit better. If we can't do that, maybe we can make the separators to the right and left of the currently hovered button disappear on hover and pressed state.

It seems like we don't have a proper widget here and it would be nice to figure out how to get this right. I'm OK with refining the hack, but we probably want to make a better widget here if we're going to support this in the long run.

Patch

This patch turns off the separator for the hovered button and the adjacent button so there is no double border. Thanks for filing this bug Asa :)

>+@navbarLargeIcons@ > #social-toolbar-item > .toolbarbutton-1:hover:not(:first-child)::before,
>+@navbarLargeIcons@ > #social-toolbar-item > .toolbarbutton-1:hover + .toolbarbutton-1:not(:first-child)::before {
>+  display: none;
>+}

In the second selector, a .toolbarbutton-1 next to .toolbarbutton-1:hover can never be :first-child, so there's no point in adding :not(:first-child) to the selector.

You can also avoid this whole rule by not adding the border in the first place where you don't want it.

This should do it, I think. Jared, can you verify? I'm on Linux right now.
