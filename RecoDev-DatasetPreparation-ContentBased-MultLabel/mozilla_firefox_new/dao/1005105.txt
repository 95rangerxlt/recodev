Steps to reproduce:

Look at the background of the active tab vs. the background of the toolbar.


Actual results:

The background colors don't match. There's a distinct boundary line between the tab and the toolbar. The difference is more noticeable on some displays.


Expected results:

The background colors should be the same.

The color varies pixel to pixel but the tab color hovers around RGB 239/245/251 and the toolbar color is around 231/241/251.

Tab vs. toolbar
(1) I actually, honestly, can't see a difference between the tab and the toolbar in your screenshot
(2) This was filed already but I can't find the dupe right now, so marking as DUPEME...

Stephen, can you look into this?
It is slightly off in the screenshot, probably has something to do with the tab stroke overlay. But I am not noticing it locally…
I can easily see a mismatch in the screenshot and locally if I look at my display from a suboptimal angle.
*** Bug 1009437 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Stephen could you please provide the needed images with the noise removed? I believe this is the complete list:

tab-active-middle.png
tab-active-middle@2x.png
tab-background-end.png
tab-background-end@2x.png
tab-background-middle.png
tab-background-middle@2x.png
tab-background-start.png
tab-background-start@2x.png
tab-stroke-end.png
tab-stroke-end@2x.png
tab-stroke-start.png
tab-stroke-start@2x.png

We'll also want to copy the updated images over to browser/themes/linux/tabbrowser/, except for the @2x variants.

Still a problem in version 30 and very noticeable on both PCs that I use regularly.
Perhaps this is only cosmetic but it's quite visible to me and makes the browser appear unclean and unprofessional. It can have a subtle but real effect on the user experience. In my opinion this should be a higher priority. It's been 4+ months now with no activity since May.
I guess it's not noticeable on cheap displays.

remove-tab-noise.patch - 01

I exported new images and made sure they do not have any kind of background or noise on them. But I am still getting weird artifacts or dithering on the tabs. Can someone else verify this please?

It might have nothing to do with the images and instead something to do with the way the tabs are constructed?

This surely looks like a definite improvement to me. I'll attach a before/after screenshot with a filter applied to make the noise and the lack thereof more visible.

This looks like a very low visibility/impact UI issue, not really worth the effort for manual testing.
I was just wondering why was the OS set to windows 7 , where I can see an attachment from linux

The screenshots are from Windows, but one has had the contrast modified.


Tab background color doesn't match toolbar color in Firefox 29 (need to remove the noise texture)
