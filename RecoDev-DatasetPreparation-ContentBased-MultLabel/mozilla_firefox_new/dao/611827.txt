As the titlebar-content is back as align mode: stretch, the widget used to display the caption buttons on the personas+glass theme is being stretched 1px taller on maximized windows. See screenshot

Thanks Dao. Yeah I think this is the best solution to avoid stretching the buttons in the future, as some themes size the titlebar-buttonbox and others size the buttons themselves.
