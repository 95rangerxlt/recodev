Closing the selected tab and reverting the URL bar are autocomplete-specific actions, so they should be done in the urlbarBindings handler if switchToTabHavingURI returns true. They aren't useful for other callers of switchToTabHavingURI (e.g. opening the addons manager).

I don't think the return value needs to be checked here, switchToTabHavingURI should always succeed.

I think you should check the return value before calling removeTab(prevTab), because we have bugs where we end up calling switchToTabHavingURI for nonexistent URIs (bug 558626), and it doesn't really hurt to be resilient. r=me with that.
