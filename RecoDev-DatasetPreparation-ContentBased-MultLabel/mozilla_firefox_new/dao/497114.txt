The new '+' icon image of the new tab button is harder to be recognized as a '+' compared to the previous image. From a distance it looks like four disconnected dots as the centre part has a lighter colour.

The old image in Firefox 3.5b4 was just fine. Is there a good reason for changing it?

Reproducible: Always

Unfortunately you've mistaken my point. I mean the '+' image itself has been made less legible now, not the button or its hover state.

proposed change

the button, including the icon, is displayed with a 70% opacity -- we should make that to 100%, which will be consistent with the other buttons.

The grooved style of the '+' image might negatively affect legibility. It looks less like a '+' sign from a distance. Will it be better if the lighter colours of the centre part is changed to better match that of the sides (causing the entire '+' sign to have a near uniform colour)?

Yeah, the icons were designed to be shown at 100% opacity in the normal state, thanks for catching that. We want all the normal states to all match.
err, it's actually not 70% but 80...
