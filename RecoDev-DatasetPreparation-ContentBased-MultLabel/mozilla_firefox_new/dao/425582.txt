This is a personal tracking bug for theme work on all platforms that I think we should try to complete before RC1 to give the product a high level of polish.  Ideally I would like to manage this list myself, so instead of going ahead and setting other bugs to block this one, I would prefer you email the bug numbers to faaborg@mozilla.com

Adjusting the bug title since some of these issues are outside of just theme work.  Also, please note that this bug has no relation to what we will actually get done before RC1, it's just a personal tracking bug for issues that I think we should try to target once all of the blocking bugs are resolved (9 bugs on this list are blocking, 48 are not).
Alex,

Think we can add theme bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=411064 to this tracking bug?  It's a glaring regression in FF3.

I'm not sure that is at the "glaring" level of visual regression, but yeah, we should try to get that fixed.
With the cutoff for Firefox 3 now behind us, what will become of all the outstanding issues that have missed the 1.9 checkin?  Hold them off for 3.0.1?  If so, do you think a new tracking bug should be created for that, as this one has gotten pretty big?

I'm not entirely sure, I'll check with the drivers and post an update here.  Some of these might be 3.1 (if that exists) instead of 3.0.1.
Alex, do you want to use that bug for 3.1 or is it resolved?
I still need to sort through all of these, it will probably happen after the summit though.
Wouldn't https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454338 be fodder for this tracking bug?

Alex, any progress on the dependency list?

instead of a single "final interface work" tracking bug, we are using whiteboard terms this time around, details here:

http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2008/10/28/polishing-firefox-week-n-special-edition/

the equivalent of final interface work would probably be [polish-easy], with a particular focus on [polish-easy][polish-high-visibility]

most of the bugs in this list should have already picked up the various relevant whiteboard terms.
