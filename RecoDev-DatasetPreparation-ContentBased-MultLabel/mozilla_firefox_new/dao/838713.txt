The measurements are less reliable in these conditions and aren't likely representative of a true "slow" startup.

The measurements are less reliable in these conditions and aren't likely representative of a true "slow" startup.
I'm not sure what impact this can have, :vladan may know more, but we shouldn't alert users about a slow startup if the slow startup was the result of an update.
This flag is set if the extension update dialog pops up after launching an updated version of Firefox (i.e. "Checking your add-ons for compatibility with this version of Firefox"). It delays some of the startup milestones
