Not tracking. Discussed with Gijs on IRC and it is blocked by GTK limitations.
I don't think we can fix this without either SVG icons or some way to check the background color of the menubar and/or tabstrip. I don't know that we have the latter. Anyway, marking in the Australis backlog so we get to this ASAP after we get 29 out the door.
Updating the tracking flags wrt Gijs comment #2
Robert, do you know of a way to request the menubar/ tabstrip or window titlebar background color? I'm asking you, because I saw you (s-)r'd quite a number of GTK-related patches...

If we'd know this color value, we can set a property on the document when we're dealing with a dark background color (like on Ubuntu) and show inverted icons in that case.
Karl will know better
I don't think we need to track this for 30/31, though we should fix it. We'll put it in the backlog.

I'm guessing these colors come from -moz-appearance: toolbar.
I don't see anything in LookAndFeel::ColorID [1] that corresponds to this, though there is a eColorID__moz_menubartext for the foreground color.
There is not necessarily a single background color as the theme can draw the background in many ways.  Perhaps its better to use the text color as an indicator.

Or perhaps the icons can be given sufficient borders so that they are visible on any background.

Or perhaps icons from the native theme can be used when the icons are on native toolbars.

No, this is -moz-appearance: menubar.

As you can see in the attached screenshot, the icons in the menu bar are almost invisible, while the icons in the tabstrip are white.

Please file a new bug.
