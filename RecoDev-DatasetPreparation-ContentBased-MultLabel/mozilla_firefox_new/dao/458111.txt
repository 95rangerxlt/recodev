this applies after bug 438302
This patch has some minor alignment problems. When selecting a previously unselected tab
 - the favicon shifts 1px to the left,
 - the close button 1px to the right and
 - the text 1px to the bottom.

And as much as I love that you're simplifying the code by removing images, now the tabs unfortunately look much less crisp. Especially the rounded corners of the selected tab have become really blurry.

This seems rather minor to me and is hardly noticeable unless you pay scrupulous attention to it. Even then I only see the difference in the selected tab's corners.

I don't think that should prevent us from getting rid of that bloated binding and messy CSS (the negative margins in particular have undesirable side effects).

That said, it should be possible to improve this with border-image.

that was actually too much padding

Looks good. We can investigate adding some border-image or box-shadow love in a followup.
