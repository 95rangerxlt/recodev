openLinkIn calls isBlankPageURL to determine whether it should raise the window and focus the location bar. isBlankPageURL returns true for about:newtab and false for about:privatebrowsing in non-private windows and vice versa in private windows. Therefore it should be called in the target window's context, as that may have a different privacy status than the current window.
