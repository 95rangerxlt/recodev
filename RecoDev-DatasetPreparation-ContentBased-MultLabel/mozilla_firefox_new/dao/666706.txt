I generated the attached tests based on <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8b5646a07963>. The eTLD service fails for every host containing a dot, e.g. [::192.168.1.1], for which it considers "1.1]" to be the base domain.

Or maybe the problem is that I'm passing the host with the brackets to getBaseDomainFromHost?

There's PR_StringToNetAddr logic in nsEffectiveTLDService::GetBaseDomainInternal that I would assume should be catching this. Does it just not handle the bracket format? I'm not very familiar with ipv6 IP address formats.

IIRC it doesn't handle that format.
Passing them without the brackets to getBaseDomainFromHost works, but removing the brackets in order to do that would be pointless, as getBaseDomainFromHost would just throw anyway.
getBaseDomainFromHost should probably also throw when the brackets are included, rather than returning a bogus result.
