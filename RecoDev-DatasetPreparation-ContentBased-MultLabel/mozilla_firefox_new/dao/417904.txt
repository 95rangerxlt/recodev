Bug 303428 was filed as a Firefox bug and has recently been moved to Core. That's good, but for the tabbrowser tabs there's still a simple workaround that we should use until that bug is fixed.

I couldn't get this rule to apply on Mac (or maybe it just doesn't have a noticeable effect). I wonder whether we can remove it.

That's because pinstripe extends the tabbrowser-tab binding.

That doesn't quite look right. I also tried .tab-text-stack > .tab-text but it isn't quit right either. I guess we can just land this as is and fix it in a followup, or not touch it and leave this to some other bug. Mano said he'd already filed this, not sure if he means bug 415957 or something else.

Thanks for the screenshots. Looks like the one on the top is least harmful.
