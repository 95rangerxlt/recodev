Not that it matters much, but you need || event.metaKey in the non-XP_MACOSX case to maintain existing behavior. (It appears to be possible for metaKey to be set on beos/qt and apparently also for gtk, though I'm not sure under exactly what circumstances - gtk docs suggest it is dependent on X server config.)

We should indeed have tests for this, as Shawn pointed out in the other bug.

added || event.metaKey as suggested
