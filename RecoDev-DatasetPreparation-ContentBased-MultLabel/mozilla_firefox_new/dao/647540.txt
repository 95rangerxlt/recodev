The toolbar-primary class is currently overloaded:

1. SeaMonkey uses it for a "grippytoolbar-primary" binding that listens to browser.chrome.toolbar_style pref changes and sets the mode attribute on the toolbox
2. Pinstripe uses it to set a min-height
3. Firefox content code uses it to exclude the nav bar, tab bar and add-on bar when hiding extension toolbars in popups

1 was the originally intended use case, I think. We should eliminate 2 and 3.

Did you intend to remove 'chromeclass-toolbar' as well?

Yes, chromeclass-toolbar tells xul.css to hide a toolbar in popup windows, but we don't actually want the nav-bar to be hidden.
