focusElement(content) is inefficient, because it uses getBrowserFromContentWindow which loops through all browsers. We could fix that by comparing aElement to content (it's useless for windows from background tabs anyway), but it still seems like a strange API. We should just focus the active browser directly, or add a helper function without any arguments that does exactly that.

focusElement(randomElement) is just pointless.

It also looks like focusElement and getBrowserFromContentWindow belong in browser.js rather than utilityOverlay.js, except that they are pretty useless anyway. I haven't changed that in this patch.

I'd probably just remove the function now though.

I'm going to do this in bug 496309 after 1.9.2 has branched.
