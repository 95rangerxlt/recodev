patch v1

I'm assuming that all you did here was add that if statement before the try block, and remove the reverse if check from inside the try block and reindent, right?  r=me assuming that!

Thanks for your patch.

I attached the patch without the whitespace changes - that shows the changes a bit cleaner :)

Actually I think these two lines should be swapped, since _ensureCanCloseWindows can lead to an early return as well.

True, fixed.

Failed on try, investigating.

patch v2

This patch revealed some errors so I had to fix some tests, I didn't touch nsPrivateBrowsingService.js.

* ui.js - When a session is restored (e.g. when switching pb mode) it's possible that UI.setActive() is called and a tabItem is passed that temporarily has no parent. So we need to check for tabItem.parent or else GroupItems.setActiveGroupItem() will fail.

* browser_tabview_privatebrowsing.js - When cleaning up after this test we're removing the second tab. We need to make sure that this tab is not selected or else tabview will be shown again (and causes the next test to fail).

patch v2 (session store tests)

This patch makes some session restore tests fail because they rely on Panorama listeners getting called _after_ the test listeners (for SSWindowStateReady). So I rewrote those tests to run in a separate window where Panorama isn't loaded, yet.

Any idea why this patch would have resolved browser.xul leaks (bug 658738 comment 72)?

I don't have a clue. Maybe Ehsan has some thoughts?
