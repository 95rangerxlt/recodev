(Note: this is filed as part of the “Paper Cut” bugs — we assume that there may be multiple existing bugs on this. Please make them block this bug, and we will de-dupe if they are indeed exactly the same. Thanks!)

People that are in the habit of using the middle-click button to open pages in new tabs often get their brains trained to use that button on elements that aren't really middle-clickable. In general this is ok — but in the case of the "New Tab" tab, it should be supported.

Recommendation:
When middle-clicking the "New Tab" tab, open a new tab. :)
