Dao, can you take a look at this patch and weigh in on what might be the problem?

It's not clear to me what these subtests are doing...

I can answer that one.

These subtests measure the average time it takes to paint the frames of the tab close animation when:

1) Closing a tab without a favicon at DPI1 (simple-close-DPI1)
2) Closing a tab with a favicon at DPI2 (icon-close-DPI2)
3) Closing a tab with a favicon at DPI1 (icon-close-DPI1).

Because we're seeing a regression in the .all measures, but not the .half, it indicates that the expensive frames are in the first half of the animation.

So something about the first frames of the close animation is slower to paint.
Ok, I have an idea what's going on.

So basically we were animating the label and close button for closing tabs even though they weren't rendered, because closing tabs have visibility:hidden.

10.8 has an enormous test queue. No idea when I will get results there. However, I see slightly improving tart numbers on all other platforms:

Why don't we just change the rule to the following:

.tab-background[fadein] {
  transition: visibility 0ms 25ms;
}

.tab-close-button[fadein],
.tab-label[fadein] {
  transition: opacity 70ms 230ms,
              visibility 0ms 230ms;

According to the compare-talos, this approach will not gain us back the 4% that we've lost here...

Looks good, thanks!
:dao and :jaws, thanks for the patch and review.  I know this isn't a 100% fix according to comment 9, but bringing us closer to fixing this is great to see.

looking at graph server, I don't see a big win here:
http://graphs.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=[[293,64,24]]&sel=none&displayrange=7&datatype=running

prior to the regression: ~11.0
after the patch landed:  ~11.5
after this fix landed:   ~11.4

It appears to be reduced slightly.

patch: hide all tab content when closing a tab

http://perf.snarkfest.net/compare-talos/index.html?oldRevs=f7320bbfb006&newRev=bde5e60ad7e6&submit=true

I don't understand why this doesn't undo the regression. I'm starting to think that the tart test is measuring something wrong :/
Does "visibility: hidden" instead of display:none undo the regression?
(In reply to :Gavin Sharp (email gavin@gavinsharp.com) from comment #16)
> Does "visibility: hidden" instead of display:none undo the regression?

visibility:hidden on tab-stack should be redundant since the whole tab already has that while closing.
