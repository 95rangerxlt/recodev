dom.disable_window_open_feature.status has been true in Firefox for ages and support for displaying status text is broken (bug 343847).
Shouldn't we then remove dom.disable_window_open_feature.status together with this? Or are you leaving it there for other applications like SeaMonkey?
Other application may still want it, but this doesn't mean it needs to be supported forever. That's however a separate decision that can happen in a different bug.

Ok. It'd be nice if this pref didn't show up in about:config in Firefox as it'll be unsupported. But I guess the effort for that is not really worth it, it's probably much better use of time on dropping support for it altogether, as this is generally a bad feature and which has been unused for a long time.

Should have been documented (see bug 862540).
Sorry, bug 872675.
