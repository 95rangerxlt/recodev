Since bug 596723 landed, the clicks outside panels aren't consumed anymore. That feels much more natural. The Australis panel menu however still consumes the clicks outside it. It's a bit annoying and it's not consistent with other panels behaviour.

Can you be more explicit about what the problematic behaviour is and what you want to see instead?
I don't know exactly how to explain it. It's clearly a follow-up from bug 596723. Before it landed, when you had a panel opened and for example clicked on a link on the page, first the panel was dismissed and then you had to click a second time to open the link. Now with bug 596723 resolved, you can directly access to the link by clicking on it. It works with every panel except the Australis menu. I hope it's more clear now.
That's because we explicitly set it to true in http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/d92bea85aa14 - bug 870897. Paging Mike, Mike and Blair to figure out why.

You're talking about consumeoutsideclicks="true"? That patch didn't change that.
After some testing, it appears that this is indeed not necessary anymore; the zoom and edit controls still function correctly without `consumeoutsideclicks="true"` on the most recent build(s).
But Dão's right: http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/f7cb839f3bfc added it.

So this is still one for mconley to answer.
http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/f7cb839f3bfc simply predates bug 596723, so consumeoutsideclicks="true" was necessary just like for all other arrow panels.

I'll be honest and say that it's been too long since I wrote that code to know why I put it there, but I trust Dao's read on the matter.
