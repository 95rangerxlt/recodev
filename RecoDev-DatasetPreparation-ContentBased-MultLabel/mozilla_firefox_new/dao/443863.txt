Refer to bug 338348.  

The call
  BrowserNumberTabSelection(event, 8);
does not select the ninth tab, but the last.  This is, it's safe to say, a misfeature.  (couldn't you use -1 if you need a sentinel value?)

The current implementation has the disadvantage that people who actually want to be able to select the ninth tab (myself among them; I can indeed tell the ninth tab in a window from the eighth and tenth on sight) have to resort to some workaround.  I've had to bind ctrl-9 to
  BrowserNumberTabSelection(event, 7);
  gBrowser.mTabContainer.advanceSelectedTab(1,true);


Reproducible: Always

patch v1

This does more than what's actually needed...

1. If we want to optimize that function for external usage (which this bug seems to be about), I think it makes sense to make the event optional, because we don't really need it to select the nth tab.

2. Made the function a tabbrowser method. tabbrowser.xml is already huge, but not as huge and cluttered as browser.js.

What about further generalizing this into negative numbers just counting backwards (i.e. -2 meaning the second last tab, etc.)?

I thought about this but couldn't find a good use case. Doesn't hurt to add it, though.

Btw, I don't think it makes sense to let the event propagate for Ctrl+8 if there happen to be only 7 tabs. The new patch changes this.

slightly less nested
It would be nice to have a test for this (just open a bunch of tabs, simulate the events, check that the correct tab is selected).

Using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1pre) Gecko/20081001 Minefield/3.1b1pre, Ctrl+9 still selects the last tab when there are more than 9 tabs. Same thing happens on Win Vista. I am not sure if this is expected or not based on the comments from the reporter, but if Ctrl+9 is always supposed to take you to the last tab then I can confirm this.
Yes, that's expected, per bug 338348.
dev-doc-needed to document the new function |selectTabAtIndex|. It can be used to select "negative" tabs, i.e. 2 from the last or to just directly select a tab at any given index.
