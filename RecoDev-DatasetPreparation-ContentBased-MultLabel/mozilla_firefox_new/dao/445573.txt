Steps to reproduce:
1. Make sure you have at least 3 tabs open.
2. Start holding Ctrl, then start holding Tab.
3. Wait a few seconds
4. release Tab and then Ctrl.

Result: Nothing happens until you release tab.

Expected: Key-repeat should kick in and cycle through tab in the panel quickly (for consistency with Cmd+Tab on Tiger).

Same actual & desired behavior on Ubuntu Linux.  (for consistency with alt-tab behavior)

I crashed shortly after following Jesse's STR using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008071602 Minefield/3.1a1pre. I have not been able to reproduce.

this applies on top of the patch in bug 445369
Note that this already works as expected on Windows. For some reason, the keydown event is repeated on Windows but not on other platforms.

Dao: using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1a2pre) Gecko/20080812022114 Minefield/3.1a2pre and following Jesse's STR, I am not able to cycle through tabs. This seems to work fine using the equivalent build on 10.5 - if I hold the tab key down I can cycle quickly through the tabs.

This is due to the way bug 374076 has been fixed -- see bug 374076 comment 33.
