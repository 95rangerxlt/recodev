Steps to reproduce:

I have a "big" screen (24 inch) with high resolution (1980 x 1200). 
Windows Vista 64 bit.

My default page on startup of Firefox 11 is a local HTML page 
(stored on local hard disk). I have increased the size of the page 
by pressing Ctrl and Mouse-Wheel to fit my screen. 
It was working with previous version of Firefox on same computer.

When i open Firefox or press Ctrl-N to open a new window,
the HTML page is displayed in a very small font, complete page is around half
of my screen. When pressing F5 the same page is redisplayed, but now in
bigger font, filling my complete page.


Actual results:

Local HTML page is displayed with small font and size is half of the screen.
When pressing F5 it is ok.


Expected results:

Local HTML page is displayed with bigger font and filling the complete screen.

This is not a recent regression.
I can reproduce Firefox3.0.19-Nightly14.0a1.
I can't reproduce on the Mac nightly.  The zoom code has changed recently, so maybe that fixed it.  Do you see the problem on nightly?
This was fixed in Firefox19+ by Bug 715402.


On startup first HTML page has default zoom level instead of stored user zoom level, after pressing F5 it is ok
