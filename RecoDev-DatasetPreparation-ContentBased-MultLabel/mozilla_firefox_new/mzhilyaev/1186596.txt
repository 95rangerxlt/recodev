Specs attached!
For the tile rollover title bar, there should be a 1 pixel white rule that separate the title bar from the tile background.
title bar color changes on rollover will be handled in the bug as well.
Bug# 1188015 will be just for setting partner provided BG color.

The attached patch looks good to me. Aaron can you take a look at the two attached screenshots to confirm the styles look correct?

Note: The favicon portion of this bug is separate: bug 1158856
Yes, these are correct. Thank you!
