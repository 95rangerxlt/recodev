The panel needs to stay initially hidden so as to not impact browser startup time.

Using collapsed for the iframes inside the panel makes sense, though. Is that alone sufficient to address the problems you're seeing?

no, if the panel is hidden when we preload the the status panels the content doesn't render correctly.  but we can require providers to reset their sizes when they get the socialFrameShow event, then we can have panel hidden on startup.

keeps panel hidden for startup, content will need to draw on the socialFrameShow event.
We can unhide the panel before we preload the panels. We just can't have it unhidden by default (e.g. when social is entirely disabled).

ok, this unhides the panel when updateButton is called, prior to setting the status iframes.  This works well, avoids the need for content to redraw the first time.

Please define |let panel = document.getElementById("social-notification-panel");| rather than using notifBox.parentNode - make it much clearer what element you're referring to (and makes it easy to grep for references to social-notification-panel if we're refactoring things later).

r=me with that.

Hmm, actually I wonder whether we should continue to use "hidden" for the iframes. It reduces the memory footprint for unused documents, and it shouldn't have any impact on behavior?

Using hidden reflows some of the content ui to zero height/width and requires content to deal with that when visible.  I think this will be a non-obvious issue for providers in general.  Let me know what you want to do.
I don't think hiding and then unhiding an iframe should have any side effects. Can you describe the problem you were seeing in more detail?

This is fine if it fixes the immediate problem. I want to investigate more later to see if we can somehow get away with hiding entirely rather than just collapsing, but that might be difficult given how we keep the content preloaded.
