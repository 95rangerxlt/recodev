Bug 788589 introduced a hardcoded reference to an image in a theme.
This is not nice for themers, as it requires to include specifically that image, even if not used in that way.

In browser/base/content/browser-social.js, line 335:
      portrait.setAttribute("src", profile.portrait || "chrome://global/skin/icons/information-32.png");

Instead of setting a src to a theme path, just remove src to indicate no image is available, and let the theme add an image (and what kind) if wanted:
if (profile.portrait) {
   portrait.setAttribute("src", profile.portrait);
} else {
   portrait.removeAttribute("src");
}

And in theme:
.social-statusarea-user-portrait:not([src]){
  list-style-image:url("chrome://global/skin/icons/information-32.png");
}

The src attribute overrides list-style-image, so :not([src]) isn't needed.

Is this sufficiently covered by tests or does this need some QA attention before release?
this doesn't need further QA attention.
