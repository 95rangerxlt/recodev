"builtin" manifest support was only ever necessary with facebook in the very early days of socialapi.  Time to just remove it, we have other activation avenues that have been around for a while now.

Might as well nix the whitelist activation as well, it is no longer used.

remove builtin and whitelist

patch also renames addBuiltinProvider -> enableProvider and removeProvider -> disableProvider.  The new names actually match the functionality that these have provided for the past year, they are the corresponding functions the addon manager users to enable/disable the providers.  I did that because I got a little lost when fixing one of the test files.

The "whitelist" partially remains to continue supporting localStorage in the frameworker for cliqz, will reach out and get them to stop using localStorage.
