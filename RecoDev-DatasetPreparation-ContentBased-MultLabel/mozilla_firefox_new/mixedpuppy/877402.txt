The recent change in bug 799014 didn't take into account the size of the arrowbox when sizing the panel.  Our intention is to size the iframe based on the size of content within it.  The tests didn't check the iframe size so we didn't catch that the change would size the iframe too small.  This patch fixes the iframe sizing as well as the test.

This sets size using the iframe, which is easier than figuring out all the panel margins, arrow size, etc.  It also works well for panels like share, which have additional ui elements in the panel.

The test has to use the same calculations as the sizeto function in order to validate the iframe is at the correct size.

this 250 should be 400 now, right?

I don't think there is much value in duplicating the logic here, and having the test use 2 calculated values with a message that says "500px" (or "400px") is confusing.

How about just dropping all the computed* values and just using hard-coded 250 and 400 literals?

It's not clear to me how to get this to apply to Aurora.
Wait, bug 799014 is 24-targeted. Do we actually need this on Aurora? Is this really 23:affected?
