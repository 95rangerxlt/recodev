fix xpcshell migration patches

I didn't review this stuff originally, so I'm lacking a lot of context.

I can see one bug in the SocialService code that you're changing (using the wrong pref branch), but I don't understand why you're changing the tests. Can you elaborate on what the problems are and why you're making the changes you're making, exactly?

Apparently xpcshell tests don't fail on exceptions inside our callback function, so the tests were passing.  There was a bug in the callback that caused an exception, then the last check didn't run.  That last check would have caught the problem in the migration function.

Looks good to me.  I guess I should have picked up that an explicit callback was going to be a problem with AsyncRunner() - bring on promises so some of these "clever" repurposing of generators can die :)
