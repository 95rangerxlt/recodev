we basically need to copy the styles for #devtools-side-splitter on all platforms.

Could you add the #social-sidebar-splitter selector to the rule for #devtools-sidebar-splitter for this and the other theme CSS files?

Still get the review from Dao, but I think this is fine from my point of view.

#devtools-side-splitter uses a color that doesn't make sense here. You're also burying the #social-sidebar-splitter styling deep in devtools style code, which is undesirable.
We can instead just add a .sidebar-splitter class in browser.js, and use it for both splitters.

We couldn't use it for the generic side bar, though, since the positioning is reversed on the left side of the browser.

new splitter css patch

created new class for right side splitter, using devtools css but with corrected colors.  devtools class overrides the color to leave as-is for them.  not using a class on linux as the left sidebar splitter doesn't seem to have any custom css.

I've verified working on osx, but lack of build VMs on travel laptop leaves me unable to verify on other platforms.

>+.sidebar-splitter-right {

This name doesn't make sense in RTL settings.

>+  -moz-border-start: 1px solid #404040;

Where did you get this color value from? Why not use a system color?

You didn't patch gnomestripe. Not sure if this is intentional.

On Windows, the generic side bar uses the default splitter styling except for aero glass and aero basic. Not sure why this splitter should be different.
This should get a UI review too.  Shane, it'd be awesome if you could post screenshots and/or screenshare with me when the patches are ready.

I'm not clear how RTL will affect this sidebar.  There is the sidebar-splitter class for sidebars appearing on the left, this has tweaks to provide the same appearance of a sidebar on the right.

It matches the left sidebar splitter:

There is no sidebar-splitter class for the left, I am assuming that the left uses the default xul styling for splitters.  I'm trying to simply match the right-side sidebar to the left.

I'll change this to do the same.

We're matching the right sidebar splitter to that of the left (splitter for bookmarks and history sidebars) for each platform.  On OSX and aero that is the thin dark line.  Otherwise it is the default splitter style.  Does this need UI review and screenshots?

This patch only changes the css for OSX and Aero.  The colors and style match the left sidebar splitter.

I have opted to leave the developer tools splitter as-is since it does not match the splitters on a per-platform basis.

Non-aero and linux are left with the default style for splitters, which is how the left sidebar splitter is styled.

Boriss, do you need pictures, or is matching the left sidebar splitter fine?

You can use ".sidebar-splitter" and "#appcontent ~ .sidebar-splitter" to discern left and right splitters.
