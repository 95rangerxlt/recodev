I was playing with the page-Mark feature and now have a icon stuck in my toolbar. I called "social.page-mark-config" and that creates the icon. In later manifests I stopped sending that message yet the icon still persists in the toolbar. It even does so after I turn on/off the provider. I have to remove the service before the icon disappears.

One of our use cases would require this to work: we want to allow the user to toggle that button in the toolbar (since many users won't want both a like and share button). I also don't see any way to disable it at runtime, there is only one message to turn it on.

fix error handling

you should be able to set data to null in the postmessage like:

    port.postMessage({topic: 'social.page-mark-config',
            data: null});

That will produce a warning in the log, but no big deal, it will unset the page-mark-config.

caveat: there is a bug in the error handler, so page marks are not getting unset.

I've got a silly question here: how and where is this page mark feature available in the current builds?

I enabled SocialAPI on Firefox 23b3, 24a2 and 25a1, and I'm not seeing the stars from the bug 853151 attachments anywhere. I'm not seeing anything similar either.

I wouldn't worry about marks to much right now, this work was primarily a refactor of existing code, which may change again due to new UX in bug 889427.  Right now, you can use the demo provider to test it.  You'll see a flag icon attached to the right end of the toolbarbutton.  The star button you mention was only for a mockup, we wont use the star for social bookmarks.
Ioana, you can test this using the demo provider as Shane suggested in comment 8:

Thanks for the details guys! Unfortunately, I can't reproduce this issue locally. Whenever I disable the provider, the icon gets removed on my 05/17 aurora build. I only tested this manually though. If you want me to also try working directly with social.page-mark-config from a manifest, please provide some guideline for that.
Thanks Ioana, I think you've done enough testing for this, we have more critical issues that need testing right now.
