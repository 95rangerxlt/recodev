When activating from the activations directory, the panel says "would you like to activate services from activations.cdn.mozilla.net".  If you're activating (for example) pocket, it should say "would you like to activate services from getpocket.com".

So what happens to "internal" then?

What are the possibilities for data.installType? If it is just "internal" or "foreign" then this is no behavior change.
There are 3 possible results, directory, internal and foreign.  directory and internal should use the origin in the manifest, foreign should always use origin of the activation.

Can you please refactor this to be more clear (at the cost of being extra verbose)?

let url = data.installType == "foreign" ?
            data.url :
            data.installType == "directory" ||
            data.installType == "internal" ?
              data.manifest.origin;
let requestingURI = Services.io.newURI(url, null, null);

Also, it would be nice if you updated the code at line 163 and 165 to use double-quotes instead of single-quotes.

I didn't realize until Gavin mentioned this change that the second case of the second ternary operator was missing from my recommendation. I see that the code that landed added in an `undefined` result for this case, which probably isn't something that we want passed to newURI.

Shane, would you be OK with changing this to an if/else-if/else and in the else calling Cu.reportError() or some other type of logging and throwing?
