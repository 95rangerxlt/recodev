I also noticed that when cycling through engines, the default engine is updated three times per engine change. This patch fixes all of this.

I originally had this to prevent a possible delay between keyboard input and a visible change in the UI, but the delay is really unnoticeable and removing this means we update the header one less time.

This line is really unnecessary, since at this point we don't even have an engine name. We can set the icon later when we have more info.

Use @2x image for retina displays. This also makes the UI use the @2x image for the placeholder icon in one-off buttons.

Bug 1188618 - In-content search: For engines without an icon, use default favicon in the header, and the @2x icon in one-offs for retina screens. r=adw
