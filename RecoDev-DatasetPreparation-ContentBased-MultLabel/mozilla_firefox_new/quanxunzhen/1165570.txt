On Mac OS X, after entering fullscreen mode, the fullscreen button is still displayed on the toolbar. It should be hidden since the system provides such button for exiting on the top menu bar.

This is a regression from bug 1162752.

Why do you care about !aShow here?
I guess it doesn't really matter... When I was debugging bug 1105939, I suspected a bug was potentially related to this, which later was proven to be false. Hence it seems to me that either version is fine. If you think the old one is better, you could obsolete the new one and grant the old one :)
