Our source editor has default 4 space indentation, and no easy way to change this. I usually do 2 spaces depending on the code base. It would be nice to detect the indentation per file.

Detect indention pref, default on

This patch adds a default-on pref. When the pref is on, the devtools editor will detect the indentation (2-space, 4-space, tabs, etc.) of a file when it's loaded or when the the text is reset, and set the indentation preference of the editor to that.
The test there is basic, but I did test the indentation detection algorithm a lot. The algorithm there is one I came up with, but I tried it and two other algorithms on 300 random JS/CSS/HTML gist files and it correctly detected the indentation in 96% of the files. Good enough I think.

Patch looks good and I'm liking indentation detection. This was bothering me. Thanks for the fix!

Why not use the same PrefObserver from styleeditor/utils ? Maybe move it to DevToolsUtils.js.

skip-if applies to vimemacs test, so please add the new detectindent script after skip-if.

Okay that also didn't go so well either. All the bc failures are due to crashes. I'm going to look for more memory leaks.

Detect indentation, but don't listen for pref changes

Pref listeners were causing memory leaks, so I took them out, to be figured out in a follow up bug. try without them: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=ea21b90e4c6a
