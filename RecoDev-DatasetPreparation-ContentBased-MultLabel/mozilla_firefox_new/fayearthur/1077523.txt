CSS source map support has been in for many releases and many bugs fixed. I think it's time to enable it by default as most people want to see the source they authored and not the generated one.

Enable sourcemaps + tooltip fix

Thanks for pushing to try! There was a failure. Turns out sometimes we were displaying the line number in the tooltip for a location link. Small fix so that we always display it.
