A few of the tools support this now in certain panes, but we should have this baked in for everything and also change the size of the toolbar text too.

zoom.patch

This patch patch add Ctrl+/-/0 to the toolbox, and removes those bindings from the web console.

It also focuses a devtools tab when it's selected. Before you'd have to click on a text area to focus the toolbox (and thus couldn't use our tab switching or zooming shortcuts until then).

Whole-hearted r+! Just tested and it makes my day. *Very* glad to see this full zoom for the toolbox. Now everything is much more readable for me. Thank you Heather!

One concern: the removal of zoom support from the Web Console makes sense, but the Browser Console is not part of the toolbox yet. Can you please keep zoom in the Browser Console only? Until we have the Browser toolbox.

Any quick code pointers on how to do that?

Browser Console instances have a _browserConsole boolean flag set to true. In the command controller I suggest you return false for isCommandEnabled() and for supportsCommand(), when the flag is false. See how cmd_close works.

Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately that makes it so the web console still swallows those keys but does nothing. Barring any breakthroughs soon I'll just add back the web console zoom and have that one be weird.

Heather: this is what I had in mind for the webconsole.js/xul changes. Like in the case of cmd_close: supportsCommand returns false, cmd_fullZoom commands are disabled by default in the xul file, and during init, if it is a browser console, we remove the 'disabled' attribute from the zoom commands.

(I started to make this patch by first reverting the changes to webconsole.jss/xul/dtd from your patch.)

Since your patch already landed, I am not sure how we should proceed. Should we make a patch that applies for fx-team or should we open a new bug?

Cmd and + and Cmd and - works for me in Mac OS X, but Cmd and 0 does nothing (i.e. doesn't restore it to the original size).

Works for me. Make sure the devtools has focus by clicking on a tool tab. File a new bug about it.
Apparently it worked after a restart of Aurora. Thanks.


Ctrl/Cmd+0/+/- should change the text size in all the devtools and the panel
