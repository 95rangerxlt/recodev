We should display the @media sidebar for original sources in the style editor. We can pull the rules out of the generated source and show the line numbers from the original file.

This is not too much of a change to make it work for original sources. Other changes are to fix oranges cropping up because of the sequence of editors being added and selected.

It took me a while to figure out what 'loc' means here (I guess location).  So basically it is an object where we only care about three things {href aka 'source', line, column}.

What confused me a bit about this loop was that loc was assigned to the full rule object, then later reassigned if in a source and then loc.href was set separately. 

IMO this would be a bit clearer and would match the interface of the varible to what is returned by getOriginalLocation():

let location = {
  line: rule.line,
  column: rule.column,
  source: editor.styleSheet.href
}
if (.isOriginalSource) {
  location = .getOriginalLocation(...);
}

...

That's just a suggestion for what would read easier for me, feel free to use it or not.  I would also change the signature of _jumpToLocation to expect this type of object instead of a rule-like object since it no longer.

Why is this expecting line 4 for each media query instead of 5 and 8?  Maybe I'm just misunderstanding source mapping. Screenshot here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2cb9vusn20p3k2q/source-map-media.png

It's a shame, but we have to use the location of the first rule within the media query as it's location, because we can't get the line number for a @media rule, see bug 591303.

Thanks for the review. Updated the confusing line. Not much we can do about the line number for now.

Do you need to include parentStyleSheet here?  I'm not positive, but it seems like the call to selectStyleSheet further down would have the same result whether it was called with source or styleSheet.

Yeah, href is null for inline sheets, so if we know the exact sheet we can select the right one in that case, and default to using the href if not.
