I have one example I just ran into:

```
response.body.should have_css("p a", :text => "hello")
response.body.should have_css("p a", :text => /[hH]ello(.+)/i) 
                                                   # True if there is a anchor tag with text matching regex
```

It should say that it couldn't determine the indentation. Instead it says the indentation is 51 spaces! It's because the only indented line is that one stray comment.

We should probably just throw out anything that's over 8 spaces.

Throw out >8 space indents and indents with less than two occurances

This'll both not recognize indents that are >8 chars, and also throw out an indent if it only occurs once, as it might be a fluke.

This is fine but when I read the bug report I was thinking:

- we could throw out comment lines.
- we could throw out lines with indents way above average, so if there's a line which goes far too high it's clearly not part of normal indentation rules of the file.
- 8 chars seems like a hardcoded arbitrary limit.

r+ because we dont need too much effort in this kind of code. ;)

... and by this I mean we need only to cater to the common cases - obviously indentation detection is a very welcome feature for all the different files we work with.

All good thoughts. As for comments, it's nice that it's language agnostic right now.
