Add a ": " after pressing Enter on a CSS property name

This just covers the case of pressing Enter, I didn't attempt to add it in the case where you're using up/down to cycle through suggestions. The patch also fixes a typo: "keyrames" -> "keyframes".

Add a ": " after pressing Enter on a CSS property name

I think the right way here would be to add the ": " in the suggestions' label property, so that it gets applied on TAB/ENTER/UP/DOWN, and also user is aware of the fact that autocompleting to this property will also add ": ".

At a later point (in a follow up) we can be more intelligent about these insertions (including !important;) so that we do not add ";" or ": " again, if already present.

I just tried this out, it doesn't look good.
You mean the repeating : in the suggestions list ?

Then at least can you make it work for all possible ways of insertions ? TAB, UP, Down, etc. ?

Add ":" after autocompleting a CSS property name

Yeah, it looked bad when the colon appeared in each item in the popup. I got it so that it will also insert a colon when you press the cycle keys.

Everything looks good.

Just about browser_styleeditor_autocomplete.js : I like that its more readable now, but honestly, there is too much duplicate and repeating code. I don't have strong feelings against it though.
Also, a try would be nice :)
Thanks for the feedback! Here's try running: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=e1bef4d5234d
Try looks good.
