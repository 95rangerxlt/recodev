The links added in bug 585563 are a light blue color against a light grey background and it's really low contrast, way below any accessibility recommendations, especially for text so small.

I nominate changing them back to black. Underlining after hovering and changing the mouse cursor is pretty good at indicating it's a link.

#555

New suggestion: grey, here's a screenshot of #555.

I like grey because the text is informational in addition to being a link. Also, black is a little too much contrast, the rules themselves should stand out more as Cedric said in the original bug.
I just want to point out that I am experimenting with a different colorscheme for the Style Inspector: see attachment 603150 from bug 712469.

Interesting, thanks for the heads up. In the meantime I think these links need to be higher contrast, a small fix.

Patch for links in dark grey, as seen in screenshot.

If you want to hardcode the text color, you need to hardcode the background color as well. -moz-dialog is a moving target and #555 may or may not be visible on it.

Rule view links to -moz-dialogText

Sorry Dao, I didn't get it the first time. Here's a patch for -moz-dialogText, which I think is a safe bet, and much more readable than the light blue.
