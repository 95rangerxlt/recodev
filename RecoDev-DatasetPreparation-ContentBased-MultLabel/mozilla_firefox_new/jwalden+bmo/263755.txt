Select Location Bar Keyboard Shortcut Opt+D does not work.  Alternate shorcuts
Cmd+L and F6 work as expected.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Opt+D
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The Location Bar should be selected.

This worked at one point in previous versions of Firefox (0.8 I believe).

alt/option + D does not select the location bar as it says it does in Firefox Help.
did they forget it in bug 231381 ?
I don't think Alt+D is supposed to work on Mac. Does it for Seamonkey?
Accel+L should work, Ctrl+D might even work if they implemented it with
acceesskey="D".

Anyway, it's probably the Firefox help doc that should be changed.
Opt+D works on Internet Explorer 5.2 for Mac.  Familiar IE shortcuts like 
Cmd+Return (Ctrl+Enter) and Opt+D (Alt+D) are key features of FireFox, 
especially for former users of IE, and are key to have across platform for 
FireFox to have consistent usability.  This shortcut worked in previous 
versions of FireFox, but stopped working along with the 9 other shortcuts 
which I've submitted separately.  Please do not remove this feature.  It is 
reason #2 why I prefer FireFox over Safari on Mac, and is critical for 
consistency across platforms (I use FireFox on several platforms).
Having option+d select the url bar would be bizarre, as it ordinarily enters a
special character which can be used in type-ahead find, text boxes, etc. This
can lead to some strange behavior--for example, the Sage extension uses
option+s. This means that I can't reliably enter whatever character option+s
produces--most of the time, Sage pops up instead. It's generally not a good idea
to use the option key (by itself) for shortcuts on the Mac.

Agreed.  I'm changing the component to Help Documentation, which should be
updated to remove the Opt+D Select Location Bar Keyboard Shortcut.
This is fallout from the bugfix for Opt/Cmd displaying on the Mac.

When you change the component, please use the "Reassign bug to owner and QA
contact of selected component" option so as to make sure the QA contact changes
accordingly.  Several people watch firefox.help-documentation@bugs to track Help
bugs, and there's no way we'll see these bugs unless we get mail about them (or
if we happen to notice them on saved Bugzilla queries).

I might get to a patch for this pretty soon...as there shouldn't be any wording
changes I'll probably just check in the fix and bypass review (assuming I make
the patch).

Okay, maybe it really wasn't. ;-)

Anyways, fix checked into branch and trunk to remove the shortcut from Help.  If
Opt+D isn't good for the Mac, you should probably make it official (or
better-documented, if that's how you choose to see it) by changing the
definition of the shortcut in browser/base/content/browser-sets.inc by enclosing
it in #ifndef XP_MACOSX/#endif:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/base/content/browser-sets.inc#201

Please report other mistakes in Mac keyboard shortcuts while you're at it.  No
one working on Help uses a Mac, so we're sort of stuck with what we can derive
from source code (unless other people tell us otherwise), which doesn't consist
of every Mac shortcut.

#ifndef XP_MACOSX for the Alt+D shortcut

This is against trunk.	I don't know or really care if it applies to aviary,
because aviary can live without this (and if it can't, porting the patch is
trivial).

#ifndef XP_MACOSX for the Alt+D shortcut

Mike doesn't have time to review anything right now, even things as trivial as
this.  I asked for a review of a patch that directly corresponded to a patch
for the same problem in another area of the app.  You'll need to find someone
else to do the review for you.
The Help doc is fixed, see comment 8. -> Keyboard Navigation.

should be reviewed by Aaron.
I'm fine with removing Alt/Option+D for Mac, based on the comment that
option+letter is used to enter extended chars. However, I had wanted the code to
be r='d by a front-end person like mconnor.

hmm, as much as the key-compatibility with other Mac browsers is a "good thing"
the Opt+whatever shortcuts obviously shouldn't be used in this case.
