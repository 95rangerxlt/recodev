Need to include the EULA as part of all release and nightly builds e.g. tar.gz,
Mac builds, and .zip builds.

This isn't necessary/useful.  From a similar issue (stripping of headers on
jarred chrome), this is the legal opinion we got from our IP lawyer:

"If you want to make a license actually bind someone, you need to inform
him of the applicability of the terms of the license prior to "sale" --
which in this case I assume occurs when the user performs the download.
It is not a question of what license is included in the product, but
what license is presented to the recipient at the time of sale.  It
always helps to provide licensing information in a product, just for
clarity.  But including a license in a product is not enough -- hence
all the rigmarole that companies go through to make their licenses
effective -- break the seal licenses, click-to-accept licenses, etc."

If its just for aesthetic or other reasons, fine, but it isn't really useful
from a legal perspective.
not blocking 1.0.3
EULAs for Mac Firefox are now in for the 1.5 release (1.8 branch) and on the
trunk.  Bug 302080.
This is fixed, I believe.
