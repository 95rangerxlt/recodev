WIP 1

looks good. We'll need to add the onUpdate references and methods to each of the registration objects and tools (I think the only one that'll really need it is the style inspector).
* Style inspector needs it (and should be easy, it already has refresh code)
* Rule View needs it (and will take a bit of code, in progress.  Will be needed if someone edits a style attribute in html view)
* HTML view needs it (when someone edits a style attribute in rule view).

Was planning to do each of these as followups, but we could do them all here.
your call, depending on the workload. Style inspector should be easy. just a matter of telling it to reselect the node.

Ruleview is baby, so you should know what needs doing.

HTML view is the trickiest of the bunch because of the ridiculous way the tree panel is constructed. Talked a bit about this in IRC, am willing to leave this as a followup.

OK, this version makes sure the highlighter rectangle and the style inspector are updated on changes from the html panel or the rule view.

probably should read "notify registered tools". That is a pretty nitty comment.

Oops, updated.

Bad context, those are documented before the diff cutoff.
