When I examine the stack trace attached to a marker in the profiler,
the function name and the link to the source line have different font
sizes.  This makes the display look ugly.

See the attached screenshot.

I'll attach a fix that changes the function name to use monospace.

give function name the devtools-monospace class

This gives the function name label the devtools-monospace class.  This
renders more nicely.

I didn't think this warranted a test case.
