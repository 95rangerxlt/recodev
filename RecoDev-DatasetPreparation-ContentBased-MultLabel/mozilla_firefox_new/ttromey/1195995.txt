Patrick suggested merging css-parsing-utils.js and css-tokenizer.js.
In a later version of the patch I dropped tokenizeCSSWithComments.
So I wonder if you still want this merge to happen?
If I'm seeing the code for the first time and need to do some CSS parsing, I may ask myself why there are 2 modules that seem to do that, judging by their names.
The css-parsing-utils name seems more generic, I would delete css-tokenizer, and move its only 2 functions into css-parsing-utils, and then move css-parsing-utils into browser/devtools/shared so it looks like something people can use.

Move css-parsing-utils and tests to devtools/client/shared; merge
css-tokenizer into that file; and fix up the fallout.
