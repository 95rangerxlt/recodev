I'm pulling this into a separate bug so that it is simpler to land.
Bug 984880 is complicated enough already.

The final patch was reviewed here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8662973&action=edit

The version I'll attach here has been rebased for the big devtools
renaming but is otherwise unchanged.

The try run is here: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=8c1b86d65f17
