I had a "try" build fail in test_eventemitter_basic.html.
The error says in part:

ReferenceError: can't access let declaration `beenHere1' before initialization: next@chrome://mochitests/content/chrome/toolkit/devtools/tests/mochitest/test_eventemitter_basic.html:61:14
ReferenceError: can't access let declaration `beenHere1' before initialization: next@chrome://mochitests/content/chrome/toolkit/devtools/tests/mochitest/test_eventemitter_basic.html:61:14


Looking at `beenHere1' I see:

      function testEmitter(aObject) {
...
        emitter.on("next", next);
        emitter.emit("next", "abc", "def");

        let beenHere1 = false;
        function next(eventName, str1, str2) {
...

So I think that `beenHere1' is calling into the "temporal dead zone":
depending on the circumstances, `next' may be called before `beenHere1'
has been bound.

The fix is to hoist the `let' up above the call to `emitter.on'.
I'll attach a patch momentarily.

hoist "let"s to avoid the TDZ

I hoisted "beenHere2" as well since it seemed possible for "onlyOnce"
to be called before that let binding was seen.

I looked at the other files in this directory and everything else was
fine.
