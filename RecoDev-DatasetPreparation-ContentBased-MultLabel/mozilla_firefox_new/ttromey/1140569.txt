show async stacks attached to timeline markers

This arranges for async parents to be displayed in a timeline marker's
stack trace.  Right now these seem to be attached to promises, but
more could be added later.

I went back and forth on how to indicate that the parent frame is
async.  Right now I have it show "(Async: Cause)" as its own line in
the stack trace.  The "Cause" is the string supplied by the core.  For
promises, it is "Promise".

Cool
I just remembered this will need a slight rebase once bug 1141553 goes in.
So removing checkin-needed for now.

Setting qe-verify- since this is already covered by automated testing. Tom, if you think there's something manual QA should look at here, please flip that flag.
Sorry for the spam. Moving bugs to Firefox :: Developer Tools: Performance Tools (Profiler/Timeline).

I've added something to the Waterfall page on this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance/Waterfall#Async_stack. Does that cover it? It seems like this is new in Firefox 41 (I don't see it in Firefox 40), although this bug landed a while ago.

I don't know what version it first worked in.

This looks good to me.  One minor thing is that, while right now we only
have async stacks for Promises, at some point there will be async stacks
for many more things.  See bug 1148593.  Also, there has been some discussion
of preffing off async stacks due to performance issues; there are some bugs
open about this as well.
