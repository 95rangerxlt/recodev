move TimelineMarker to a new header

This moves TimelineMarker to a new header.

It's a little more complicated than a straight move.  Since the class
was previously nested, I had to update various users.  Also, I had to
make a new .cpp file because TimelineMarker constructors need to call
nsDocShell methods and so I had to break the dependency cycle.

This is based on the patch in bug 1104213.

In the new files please use mozilla coding style - so 2 spaces for indentation.
With that, r+

I'm not sure why I thought 4 was the correct indentation.
Fixed in this version.
