Selectors, rule names and values are added to Wrong stylesheet if you click autocomplete suggestion in popup.webm

STR:   (Win7, Nightly 42.0a1 (2015-08-07))
1. Open data:text/html,<body><style>body{background:tan;}
2. Open Devtools->Style Editor. Press "New"
3. Start typing "bo"   [autocomplete popup "body" will appear]
4. Click that autocomplete item with left mouse button

RESULT:
In just created stylesheet I still see "bo". But if "body" was added to the top of 1st (background) stylesheet. Same applies for names and values of rules

EXPECTATIONS:
Autocompleted string should be in 2nd (active) stylesheed.

I think the bug here is that AutocompletePopup reuses elements here:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/shared/autocomplete-popup.js#56

... but it attaches listeners for each style sheet here:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/shared/autocomplete-popup.js#106

... and doesn't try to filter the click based on which style sheet is selected; so the
click callback is called for the first style sheet.

This fixes completion by giving each AutocompletePopup its own name.
I didn't see anything readily available to use as a name, so I just
added a counter.
