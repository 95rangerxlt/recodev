Bug 1216234 had some issues that turned out to be that, at the end of
a require chain, one file did Cu.importGlobalProperties -- and if this
wasn't run, the code would fail.

It's better to avoid importGlobalProperties and instead make special
modules in Loader.jsm that can be required.  This will avoid confusing
results like that.

Note that Sandboxes have a significant memory cost. I think it's ok, but we should share a common sandbox if we start doing this for new symbols.
