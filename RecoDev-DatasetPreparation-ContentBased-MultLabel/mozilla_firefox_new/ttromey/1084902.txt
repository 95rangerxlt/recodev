Steps to reproduce:
1) Enable browser_profiler_console-record-09.js and browser_profiler_data-massaging-01.js in browser/devtools/profiler/test/browser.ini
2) Run ./mach mochitest-devtools browser/devtools/profiler/test/browser_profiler_console-record-09.js browser/devtools/profiler/test/browser_profiler_data-massaging-01.js from the fx-team tree root
3) Observe an apparent hang and following exception in the terminal:

This probably started failing because the tests are disabled. Yet another reason to fix bug 1047124...
If I enable all the profiler tests by editing the appropriate browser.ini,
and then run them, I see quite a few fails like this:

FWIW this hack at least lets the tests run so that I can debug other things
(I also applied the obvious change to browser/devtools/profiler/test/browser.ini
to re-enable all the tests.)

I couldn't quickly find what makes "to" read-only.

Now the original ProfilerConnection._customProfilerOptions object is completely frozen and trying to use it again causes the exception.
Thanks for finding that.

I am quite curious to know how you found it.  Was it by simply reading the code?  Or some other means?

First I grep'd the code to figure out which code-path was causing the issue. After seeing this._customProfilerOptions to be passed to the offending function I figured out that that was the issue.

After that I used the chrome debugger to follow the object around to figure out where it was frozen. When I stepped over this._client.request(data, deferred.resolve) in shared.js:173 the debugger showed the object had been frozen (a little lock appeared next to it in the scope variable list).

On the next attempt I stepped in to the method and repeated the same process. That lead me to transport.js _send method that contained a call to deepFreeze which sounded about right. Then it was just a matter of taking a quick look at the code to confirm that the method did what its name implied.

copy _customProfilerOptions before sending request

After looking a bit, I think my original hack is reasonable.  It's
probably the best spot to do the copying, as it is the only spot that
knows the structure of the object to copy (it is opaque to lower
layers).  Making new objects is what other front objects seem to do as
well.

I added a comment to explain why this was needed.

Note that this patch (without the comment) and a browser.ini patch to
re-enable the profiler tests were part of the try build for bug 1047124:

I believe you could also do:

let localOptions = Cu.cloneInto(this._customProfilerOptions, {});

to copy the object without needing to list properties individually.

Thank you very much, this works nicely.

Looks reasonable to me. Sorry for the delay for reviewing this simple patch.
Do you intend to re-enable the disabled test in this bug too? Or is there a follow-up bug on file already?

No worries!

See the dependencies of bug 973974 (this is one of them).
I think these all should be fixed before re-enabling the tests.
The undiagnosed ones are in bug 1094920.
