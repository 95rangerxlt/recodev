It's been failing intermittently since it was landed (bug 431729). Could be a timing issue, given that it uses a setTimeout. I've disabled it for now.

shouldn't be a timeout issue since it uses a setTimeout of zero so the load handlers fire
A setTimeout of 0 is a setTimeout of 10ms, and it can still introduce races if the machine is heavily bogged down (which is the case for the Linux unit test machines).

The patch

This test has been disabled for quite some time, and it cannot be re-enabled because it uses nsIDownloadManager.

There is no point in having the file in the tree. Other existing tests, rather than one with an intermittent failure, are a better starting points if we ever want to write a front-end test for this functionality.
This is part of the work to remove all references to nsIDownloadManager.
