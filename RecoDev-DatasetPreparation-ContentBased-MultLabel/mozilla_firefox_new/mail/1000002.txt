This patch changes the one of 'Style Editor' to 'l' because all the letters in 'Eyedropper' are already used elsewhere and 'l' is the only available letter which doesn't duplicate an access key. Unfortunately, that letter isn't wide.

With devtools.chrome.enabled and remote debugger enabled, there are 17 menu items with 16 accesskeys. Two available letters in other labels are 'g' (several occurences) and 'k' (Network) - we could also change the access key for Page Source from 'o' to 'g' and use the 'o' e.g. for Eyedropper.

Furthermore, I changed the accesskey for App Manager from lowercase 'a' to uppercase 'A' so the first letter of the label gets underlined.

Please update the entity name here since other locales that continue to use "App Manager" as the label may want to update their accesskey to match.

Ditto.
From IRC:
<I> 23.04.2014 10:17:02 hi, can you please take a look at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1000002 and tell me if it requires a string change?
<flod> 23.04.2014 10:41:13 no, accesskeys don't require new ID, since each locale has its own

But I can see where you are coming from. ni Pike
Yeah, no ID change. Might be good to post to .l10n to get folks' attention, though.
