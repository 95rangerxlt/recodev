Update the Downloads Panel visual design.

This contains mock icons created by scaling up the icons we already had. Works
better than the current icons, while waiting for the final ones. This patch
also contains many other visual design enhancements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pretty sure most of the css values will require tweaking and polish before the end, so not going to nitpick on them for now, let's get the interaction and design almost right, and polish it hard before release.
Now that Mac OS X arrow panels use light coloring (bug 771284), it's quite
possible that the new icons included in this patch will be less visible.

The icons, however, should be still usable given they have a border. To prevent
further delays in making the new panel design available to Nightly testers, I'm
going to land this patch as is, since we can easily follow up with new icons in
the next few days. If Stephen deosn't have time to invert the icons, we can
temporarily use the Windows icons instead.
