Instead of adding the listeners as functions, please consider adding gSearchPane, and implementing a handleEvent method instead, with a switch() over the event type and then checks on the target IDs. This will avoid having to use anonymous functions to keep |this| in line (as |this| will be gSearchPane anyway in those cases).

Nit:

let node = document.getElementById(aId);

I'm not sure if it's necessary to remove align="start", but it's certainly a good idea in principle. However...

... but then you can also remove pack="start" (the equivalent is -moz-box-pack: start).

The same goes for flex (-moz-box-flex).

I think with those attributes (XUL flexbox model) we should be consistent and either move all of them to CSS or keep all of them in XUL. Considering precedent and requirements for this bug, I guess right now we should keep them in XUL, but we should open a discussion on firefox-dev. Personally, I suspect moving away from the attributes and towards using CSS for these is a good idea, but we should get feedback about it and then implement it more widely. :-)

the equivalent of align="start" in XUL is -moz-box-align: start, not text-align: start.

You're not actually adding gSearchPane as an event listener anywhere... did you not test this? Or did you forget to qref?
