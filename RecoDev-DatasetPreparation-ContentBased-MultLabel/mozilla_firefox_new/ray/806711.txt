In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the perwindow directory, and then it needs to be rewritten as a browser-chrome test.  Instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.

This is being modified radically by bug 723005.
This is now ready to be worked on.

The original test doesn't seem to do anything, other than adding a entry to Places and do a check because some of the code were removed in patch for bug 723005.

Therefore, I have made the browser test to do what it should be.
1) Open a page with title "Test 1" in a normal window
2) Update entry in Places for the test url with title "Test 2" in a normal window
3) Open a page with title "Test 1" in a private window and check to ensure the entry's title in Places remains "Test 2".
