Patch

Applies on top of the patch in bug 780530 (that adds the browserBundle variable).
The patch is really simple, here's the freedesktop.org specification about additional app actions: http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#extra-actions

Patch

Do any other apps have Remove actions?
What do they use for "Name"?
I wonder whether "Uninstall" might be better than "Remove", if "Remove" could be interpreted as just removing the app from a menu?

The Exec string above peudoquotes the path.
This Exec string should at least be consistent in the quoting it uses.

No other app has such an action (as normally they are removed manually or through a package manager).

Yes, "Uninstall" is probably better. I'll use it.

The quotes aren't needed, I'm removing them in another patch in another bug.
