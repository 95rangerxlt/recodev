thanks Marco. WebappOSUtils.jsm is already in the tree so we should implement this there directly. Also, turns out XP_UNIX is also defined both for Android and B2G, so I'm trying to come up with a proper solution on how to handle this. Ideas appreaciated :)

What do you think about the approach about the XP_UNIX problem? Is it too chaotic?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

So instead let's do the better aprroach that we discussed about just dispatching a webapps-uninstall notification in Webapps.jsm, and then webappsUI can catch that notification and call WebappOSUtils.uninstall.  This will ensure this code is only used in desktop.

Moving forward we might split this file into one per OS (still thinking about that), but let's not do this in this bug
