Patch

We're now using the localized name to set the installation
directory name, we should use the non-localized one so that
users can change their locale without breaking apps.

Before bug 1013895, we used to install apps both in the system
and in the registry using the localized name. At startup, though,
we were modifying the registry again using the non-localized name.
So in the end we've actually been using the non-localized name
for a long time without any problem.

According to bug 1013895 comment 8, on B2G the name property was
meant to be used as the process name, so it shouldn't matter
whether we use the localized name or the non-localized one there.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This seems reasonable, especially considering bug 1013895.  The patch itself has a conflict, but it's trivial to resolve.  Please run this through try before pushing it!
Note: I see a leak of the URL chrome://global/skin/icons/webapps-64.png when running mach mochitest-chrome dom/tests/mochitest/webapps/ on my Mac, but it doesn't seem related to this patch, as it occurs without the patch as well.

You filed bug 967302 sometime ago and resolved as WORKSFORME, so it's probably intermittent?

Hmm, unsure, it used to happen all the time, then it stopped happening, and now it's happening again all the time; which is not quite what I think of as "intermittent." :-)

In any case, I've reopened the issue.


Use the non-localized name to install apps
