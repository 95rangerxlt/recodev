What are the security implications of this? Presumably normal webpages won't get access to this because they don't have the "tcp-socket" permission, but how do apps get this permission on desktop? Do apps that are installed from the marketplace on desktop that request the tcp-socket permission get it, just like on firefox os?

Yes.
For Firefox desktop the API is still completely disabled (the pref change only affects the webapp runtime).
In the runtime, only apps that have the "tcp-socket" permission will be able to use the API.
The permission will be granted just like in Firefox OS (when bug 892837 lands).
