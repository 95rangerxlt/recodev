There are some relatively minor tweaks to the migration strings - http://is.gd/sync_migration_ux_pdf.  While going through this I also found a few other things we weren't doing quite right (particularly around the "join the party" flows).

This bug is to update what's already landed to these new requirements.

Drew should be back long enough before the merge to review this - although this must land before that merge as it has strings.

This comment is a better explanation than the similar comment you added in browser-fxaccounts.js IMO.

Hmm, "upgradeToFxASubsequent" makes me think that these strings are still about asking the user to upgrade.  It's more like "upgraded on another device" or "sign in on this device."

But they are :)  It's saying "sync was upgraded elsewhere, do you want to upgrade here too?"

I agree the name sucks - do you have a concrete suggestion?  I spent quite a few brain-cycles trying to come up with a good name, and even with a week of reflection I'm still stuck :)
To my mind there's only one upgrade, not an upgrade per device.  Once you do the upgrade, from one device, you only have to sign in on other devices.

signInAfterUpgradeOnOtherDevice?  It's not a huge deal, r+ with upgradeToFxASubsequent too.
