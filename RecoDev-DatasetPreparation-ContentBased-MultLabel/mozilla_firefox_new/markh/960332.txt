Updated to version the context.
fxa-content-server PR #296 [1] causes the content server front end to listen for messages from Firefox desktop if firefox.accounts.remoteUrl contains the `context=fx_desktop_v1` search paramater.

Update the URLs

This patch also adds a pref for the "settings" URL.
I presume we should also be matching these on Android.

We currently use:

  public static final String DEFAULT_IDP_ENDPOINT = "https://api-accounts-onepw.dev.lcip.org";
  public static final String DEFAULT_TOKEN_SERVER_ENDPOINT = "http://auth.oldsync.dev.lcip.org";

What should those be?
We're doing this:

Let's not land this immediately. We're not going to update prod FxA until 1/24 (gene on PTO), so it's prudent to remain on the dev box until then.

Final API/IDP endpoint: https://api.accounts.firefox.com/v1
Final token server endpoint (Desktop change is not covered by this patch): https://token.services.mozilla.com (not currently live)

Sorry, full endpoint is: https://token.services.mozilla.com/1.0/sync/1.5
See bug 963251 for token server URI changes.

oops, screwed up the previous attachment.
Since markh is already dev-ing with this patch applied, let's land at markh's convenience.
Need prod versions of the tos and pp urls in bug 959990
