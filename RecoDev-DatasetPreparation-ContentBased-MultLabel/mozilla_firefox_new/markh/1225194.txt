1. on another device, open a tab with 'news' in the title
2. on desktop, type 'news' in awesome bar
3. select row from with the sub title 'Your tab from other device'

actual:

expected: jumps to URL as expected

well, that's embarrassing :) It looks like the code to actually take the action got lost somewhere. This patch fixes that and also adds a test.

doesn't look like the test is cleaning up after itself for the next tests. It would probably be better to open a new tab, and close it when done (BrowserTestUtils.withNewTab could be handy)

It's actually OK because there's no new tab open - the current tab is replaced by the action. The test harness itself resets the 1 remaining tab to about:blank (although I guess I could do that too if you are bothered by that?)
I was just wondering that testing in a new tab is less likely to "break" future tests making assumptions on the pre existing tab (like session history or such). I don't recall if the harness replaces the first tab before each test.
it's not critical, just that I usually prefer to keep each test well separated.
OK, I've pushed this with the test creating a new tab, thanks.
