We actually do gracefully handle non-JSON responses, error or otherwise: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/readinglist/ServerClient.jsm#142

Or I guess it depends on your definition of graceful.  We just log.info() the message in comment 0 plus the exception.  Maybe we shouldn't do that for status codes that are expected to not always return JSON?
I would expect it to log the (truncated?) body, rather than logging an error and stacktrace about failing to parse.

IIRC it was decided a week or so ago that 5xx wouldn't necessarily be JSON, so this bug is basically about being less alarming! :D
Yeah, I guess where we do:

          log.info("Failed to parse JSON body |${body}|: ${e}",
                    {body: response.body, e});

We should just make it a debug, not bother reporting the exception (and thus not get the stack) and log the first 1k or so of the body.
