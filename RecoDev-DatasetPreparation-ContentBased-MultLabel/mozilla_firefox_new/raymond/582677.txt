You can run it using:
TEST_PATH=browser/base/content/test/browser_drag_drop_tabcandy_item.js make -C obj-ff-dbg mochitest-browser-chrome

Timers are generally bad to have in tests. It will slow down the total time to run tests and be prone to timing issues. Typically these have been avoided by listening to events for when something should have happened. Or if those events don't exist, they're added.

We'll probably want some wrappers around the drag event pattern once we figure out what behavior it should support.

Got it. Since we have zoom out/in for Tab Candy and other animations, we will need to add events to notify others when zooming out or in is actually finished for this test.

You can use the Subscribable interface that's built into Group and TabItem to create those events.

* Removed all the timeout and using the Subscribable interface in the Group.
* Custom events are fired when tab view is shown and hidden which would also solve bug 583182

Looks great! Raymond, please apply.

I see that you've done some clean up as well... very cool. One of the benefits of writing tests! :)

As mentioned last night, if you think this interface may go asynchronous, keep the callback. But as it is right now, it's all synchronous, so no need for the callback.

Fix the indenting here, $(NULL) should be aligned with everything else.
