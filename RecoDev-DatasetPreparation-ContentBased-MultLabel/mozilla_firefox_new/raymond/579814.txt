Firefox has a number of shortcuts meant for tab-manipulation. Unfortunately, the way that we've implemented Tabcandy breaks most of this shortcuts. The following is a list of keyboard shortcuts that we need to fix.

Command/Alt + 1, 2, 3, ..., 9: To switch to the nth tab

Control+Tab/PageDown: Switch to the next tab
Control+Shift+Tab/PageUp: Switch to the previous tab

*** Bug 579539 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Based on http://support.mozilla.com/en-us/kb/keyboard+shortcuts, I've fixed the following

Switch to the nth tab:
* Windows: Control + number
* Mac: Command + number
* Linux: Alt + number

Switch to the next tab:
* All: Control+Tab/PageDown
* Mac: Command+Opt+Right Arrow 
* Mac: Command+}
Switch to the previous tab:
* All: Control+Shift+Tab/PageUp
* Mac: Command+Opt+Left Arrow
* Mac: Command+{

This is only from within tabcandy ui? Aza marked bug 579539 as a dupe of this where the other bug was for cmd-# from outside tabcandy.
I had meant for all of these to work outside of the tabcandy UI as well. To be honest, I hadn't thought about what it would mean for them to work inside the Tabcandy UI. On reflection, it seems fine that they also work inside of Tabcandy, but the important thing is for them to work correctly when you are inside a group.
Those works outside of the tabcandy UI for this bug.

Bug 579192 is for inside of Tabcandy.
