Looks good, except the original creation of visibleTabs: it uses "for each", which we've recently discovered is not guaranteed to maintain order. Can you rewrite that to use [].forEach and then apply the patch?

Removed the "for each"

Raymond, thanks for removing the for each. Unfortunately now the routine modifies the "tabs" argument directly, which is a bad situation waiting to happen. Can you please fix that?
Ah, I wasn't aware that we shouldn't modify the tabs argument passed into the showOnlyTheseTabs()

Ian: please mark this bug as resolved if everything is OK.
     1.7 +      var visibleTabs = [];
     1.8 +
     1.9 +      tabs.forEach(function(tab) {
    1.10 +        visibleTabs.push(tab.tab.raw);
    1.11 +      });

Curious, why not

let visibleTabs = tabs.map(function(tab) tab.tab.raw);

?

I think it's a good general rule that you should never modify an argument unless it's an explicit part of the function. In other words, addStuffTo(obj) should modify obj, but tellMeAbout(obj) should not. 

In this particular case, the array passed into showOnlyTheseTabs() is just meant to guide the operation, not be the result of the operation, so modifying it shouldn't be a side effect. In fact, in a number of cases, the routine is called with a group's master list of children, so modifying the array would have disastrous effects. 

Anyway, thanks for the fix... looks good!
