Per http://www.joshmatthews.net/blog/2011/03/nsitimer-anti-pattern/, if we make it through the delay in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/tabview/browser_tabview_bug599626.js#122 without doing GC, then the timer fires, but if we GC there's nothing to keep it alive, so it gets eaten, never fires, and the test times out.
