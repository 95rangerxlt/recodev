Since forever ago, we save files in an XML format, and we've converted any existing Sherlock (.src) files in the profile directory to that format. Since there's been no way to create these files in the profile since Firefox 2, we should be able to stop supporting Sherlock files dropped into the profile.

This is step 1 to removing support for the Sherlock format entirely. This patch just avoids the conversion, but still loads the plugins, so it's pretty simple code removal.

I think I'll do the rest of the work in two steps:
1) stop supporting loading Sherlock files from disk entirely
2) stop supporting installation of Sherlock file from the web
