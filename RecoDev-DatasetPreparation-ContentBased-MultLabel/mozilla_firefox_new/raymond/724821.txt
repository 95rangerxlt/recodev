Even though I see the error message mentioned in point 3) but I can reproduce your issue on Firefox 13 Mac and Windows.

Can you create a new profile and try to see whether you can reproduce it?

OK, I can reproduce now. I missed some steps.

After those steps, controllers.removeController(this._controller) throws an exception which causes the issue. Adding a try and catch block solves that.

How does this fix the error message of point (3)?

I don't like putting a try/catch around this, that would just hide the actual problem. If .removeController() gets called repeatedly we should fix that and maybe introduce a flag that lets us not do it twice.

The error is not related to this bug at all, however, this patch should fix that too.

Oh, I see, thanks for including it. I'd normally tend to file a separate bug for this but it's a very small fix so I'd be ok with letting it as is.

The patch looks fine to me but I'm not at all familiar with the places toolbar. Asking Marco for additional review.

Various toolbar customization tests call ignoreAllUncaughtExceptions. Can they stop doing this?

I have removed ignoreAllUncaughtExceptions() in various toolbar customization tests.  Those tests passed in my machine.  Pushed to try and waiting for results https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=5da19af5673f

I suggest handling removal in other tests in another bug, cause would be quite unrelated.
Very good we can stop ignoring exceptions here.

Seems that this bug fix is causing me to crash as soon as I start to type in the Location Bar.  Probably other ways to crash FX.

Regression checking led me to cset http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-central-win32/1338468385/ which appears to only contains 724821.

Here's a crash dump:  https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-4dfdfd7d-ed92-4146-9cb4-5f7812120531
More info for you:

A new profile doesn't cause a crash.  Starting with add-ons disabled still causes the crash.  Could it be a Pref that is causing the crash?
Seems that the following pref along with this fix is causing my crashes:

user_pref("layers.offmainthreadcomposition.enabled", true);
