Looks like the default value for `loop.gettingStarted.url` is missing a trailing slash '/' at the end:

`https://www.mozilla.org/%LOCALE%/firefox/%VERSION%/hello/start`

I think (?) this could result in the FTE opening a new tab every time the conversation connects, as bedrock will append a trailing slash when the page opens like e.g.

https://www-demo2.allizom.org/en-US/firefox/37.0a1/hello/start/?utm_source=firefox-browser&utm_medium=firefox-browser&utm_campaign=settings-menu

When testing locally this missing trailing slash was the reason one of my machines was opening a new tab every time, while the other was not. But then I noticed the default value in Firefox is also omitting a slash.

This was determined here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1099462#c3

I'll also mention that we'll need to double-check the Tour link from the Gears menu.

+ :jaws as he worked on the original bug.
Going to fix and try uplift to Beta today.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Bug 1099462
[User impact if declined]: If the URL in-product doesn't match the existing tab URL, multiple tabs may end up getting opened instead of re-using the tour tab.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: QE will test the tour before release
[Risks and why]: Low risk one-character change adding a "/"
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
Thanks Gavin.
