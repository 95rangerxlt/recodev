Since Bug 1110602 landed, it look like UITour highlights & info panels are no longer being hidden when refreshing the web page.

STR:

1.) In the latest Nightly, click Help -> Nihghtly Tour
2.) When the doorhanger shows to start the tour, click "Let's go"
3.) The first step of the tour now opens the menu panel
4.) Hit refresh to reload the page

Expected results:

The menu panel and highlight should have been hidden.

Actual results:

The menu panel remains open when the page reloads

I think we should be able to work around this on the web side by making sure we send "hide" events on the `beforeunload` event

I notice the same also happens if you click a link and navigate to another page when a highlight is showing. I'm guessing this is because Bug 1123010 hasn't been implemented.

Matt - is this something that is going to be picked up shortly and something I shouldn't have to worry about on the web side?
Note that I don't think the summary is a Firefox regression as bug 1123010 behavior never worked but bug 1079554 made the page's own cleanup via hide* methods ignored. If we don't fix bug 1123010, the short-term fix is adding the hide methods to BACKGROUND_PAGE_ACTIONS_ALLOWED.

Given that this is currently causing some odd quirks in production for Firefox 36+, can we get one of these fixes in soon?
I'll do the short-term fix now.

endUrlbarCapture should probably be here too (until we decide to jetison it).

This is fixed in Nightly, but still effects Firefox 36 & 37. Does this need uplifting still, given that Bug 1110602 got uplifted?
Yes, I'm requesting all of the UITour uplifts today.
Note that status-firefox36: affected & status-firefox37: affected state that uplift is needed.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Bug 1079554 & Bug 1118874 - Hello tour/snippet/product page for 36
[User impact if declined]: Tour annotations aren't torn down in some cases.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: This returns to behaviour from before 1079554 for a few APIs
[Risks and why]: Low risk isolated to UITour. Returning to older behaviour as a stop-gap for the proper solution.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

RyanVM/others: Note that I will do uplifts myself since there are many UITour patches to uplift in the correct order.
