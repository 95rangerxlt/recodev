v.1 "addon" => "add-on" and "Add-on Manager" => "Add-ons Manager"

We're supposed to use "add-on" everywhere facing users, not "addon".

I also fixed the name of the Add-ons Manager.

Axel, since I'm not changing the meaning, only changed pre-defined terms, is it fine that I don't change the entity names?

This is OK from an l10n POV.

We're a bit inconsistent of Add-on vs add-on, we kinda use both across our code, it seems.

Won't the entity names need changed? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Making_String_Changes

v.1 Patch for checkin

See comment 0 and comment 1 about the entity name.

Consistency is actually pretty good, also because we usually file bugs when we see "addon" (must have missed this)

add-on debugging checkbox should be spelled "add-on", not "addon"



Bug 1026123 - Change the options.enableChrome reference to "add-ons" and the "Add-ons Manager" for consistency. r=Mossop, r=Pike
