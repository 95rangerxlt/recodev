Tracking bug for version and configuration bumps for the Firefox 2.0.0.1

Tracking bug for version and configuration bumps for the Firefox 2.0.0.1
release.
To keep the nightly updates going we'll need to put the new version in the AUS config:
  http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/webtools/aus/xml/inc/config-dist.php
I guess the => 2.0 mapping will continue, so it's an easy patch.

If the versioning plan is settled, maybe do a version or two in advance ?

Fix nagios monitoring files

I also removed the XULRunner Mac and Windows builds, since there are no tinderboxes for them at the moment. That leaves only the stale Mac 1.8.0 xforms.xpi to spam the build mailing list every day, but that actually needs fixing :-).
AUS config was updated in production.

I'll check these in.
Everything in this bug has been checked-in. Resolving and adding fixed1.8.1.1 keyword to show this.
This is a release tracking bug for 2.0.0.1; we also use it to track build configs and such.

Please don't resolve it.
And over to TR, since he's doing 2001

Version bumps for win32 mozconfig

Somehow this didn't make it as part of the patch. I caught it doing the minimum locale verification. It should be applied to the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH_l10n_release branch.

Patch to linux/mac mozconfig to rebuild missing locales

This should be landed on MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH_l10n_release and tagged with FIREFOX_2_0_0_1_RELEASE_l10n.

This is to make the pa-IN locale which was just added to shipped-locales and also to remake the "ko" locale on mac that failed due to a (maybe transient) hdiutil failure.

Patch to linux l10n mozconfig to rebuild all locales

This should be applied to the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH_l10n_release branch and should be tagged with FIREFOX_2_0_0_1_RELEASE_l10n.

I made a mistake building the linux l10n repacks. I must have forgotten to remove the last-built file because the *.complete.mar files were not produced. This change adds all of the locales back into the mozconfig so I can rebuild them all.
