As seen in comments in bug 364298, sourceView is null when the onDrop() method is called in controller.js , and it doesn't seem like it should be.

sourceView shouldn't be null

This patch forces the boolean "copy" to true when dragging from a read-only container, but fails when DnD to the toolbar, where sourceView is null upon DnD.

Is there a reason sourceView was being set as null in toolbar.xml's onDrop? Is it simply because it's not necessary/because it works fine without passing controller.js an actual sourceView? Hmm... Either way, this works fine now.

re-assign review to dietrich.

this bug has been bit rotting in my review queue for a while.
after recent fixes this is actually WFM, at least on Windows. Most probably due to recent cleanup made on that code (PlacesControllerDragHelper.onDrop now takes only an insertionPoint) by Bug 412148. 
marking as fixed by that bug.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
