bug1126756.patch

This is a WIP patch to address the leakage when using UITour from a browser without a tab. Unfortunately, this does not seem to address the problem.

There's something tricky going on, as |this.tourBrowsersByWindow.get(window)| returns "undefined" when called within the |onOuterWinDestroy| function.

One reason why I was hoping for a browser notification instead of a content window one is because of e10s. I'm not sure which process(es) get outer-window-destroyed.

You seem to be mixing up the ChromeWindow and the window loaded in the browser.

`window` is the Chrome window but you want the content window which you would need to do in the child process.

The |Services.appinfo.processType == Services.appinfo.PROCESS_TYPE_CONTENT| is false in |onOuterWinDestroy|.
I filed bug 1131313 about outer-window-destroyed not working in frame scripts with e10s off so we may have to morph this bug to go with the following (which I haven't tested):

Cleanup UITour when no TabClose is available.

This patch allows to cleanup UITour using "message-manager-disconnect" if no tabs are available (i.e. windowless browser).

I guess this works when there is only one tour browser without a tab but it should really only teardown the browser that is closing. aSubject should be the message manager and then you can loop over the tourBrowsersByWindow to find the browser that has that message manager with browser.messageManager. I personally would replace the TabClose code with this approach and call tearDownTourForBrowser to do a full cleanup.

Given this slipped by when we first added handling sources without a tab, and this bug wasn't filed for a week after that, I'm not terribly convinced we'll notice right away if we regress this. So I think we need a test for the tab-less case.

Should break out of the loops here, least we keep iterating over everything.

This screams for a comment explaining the intent here (or add addObserver).

It didn't slip, it was something Dexter and I were going to deal with once we needed it. Dexter wrote a test in bug 1111022 already.
If it makes things clearer maybe we could move UITour related changes out of 1111022.

I addressed the comments. Blair, are you able to review this today as Dexter is trying to wrap up the heartbeat stuff and it's tiny changes.

We would like to uplift this to beta to make Firefox 37 Beta 2. This should be uplifted together with the following bugs (order matters):

* 1128500 (introduces the HiddenFrame object)
* 1126756 (this bug)
* 1128564 (whitelist selfsupport URL)
* 1111022 (Self-Support backend)

[Feature/regressing bug #]:
Needed for heartbeat / selfsupport v0, bug 1111016

[User impact if declined]:
Heartbeat and self-support will not be available for the user.

[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: UITour tests and a test introduced with bug 1111022 cover this change.
[Risks and why]: Low risk isolated to tours. Chance that closing a tab doesn't properly cleanup but this is unlikely due to many automated tests.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: No
