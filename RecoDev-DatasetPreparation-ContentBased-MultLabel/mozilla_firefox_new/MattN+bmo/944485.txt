Seems to affect Windows XP and Linux (which both show the menubar by default). I'm heavily leaning towards bug 940902 as the culprit.

For a quick fix, this can be backed out of Holly since it doesn't need to be in pre-Australis builds. Otherwise, I can look into why opening the menu is not sync. on these platforms and possibly change the test to wait for the menu to open.

If it doesn't need to be there, I guess I'll opt for backing it out. Probably not worth your time to investigate something that doesn't really matter.
