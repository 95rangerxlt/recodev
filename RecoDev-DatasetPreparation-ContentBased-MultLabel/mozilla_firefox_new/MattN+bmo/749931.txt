Perhaps caused by Bug 737381?

> Perhaps caused by Bug 737381?

Yes, it was caused by that bug.  The dialog UI code should now use MU_getLocalizedString to get the names of the items.

Thanks for the report Alexander! Note that this feature is broken on Nightly until bug 748047 is fixed.

MigrationUtils is a browser/ module.

So, I think you want to move these files to browser/, but keep them in the current chrome address. That way, each app would have to provide this ui, in that chrome address. That's better than forcing the app to provide locale files and modules...

Alternatively, about:support could be moved to browser/. I think the benefit of having it in toolkit is very limited.

It doesn't seem necessary to require an application to re-implement the dialog when they already have to implement the migrator.  I moved the import into getMigratedData to address the issue since resetSupported already checks that a migrator for the app exists since migrators are also browser components.  Also keep in mind that this change needs to land on Aurora.

That could be moved as a separate bug if desired but it shouldn't block this follow-up fix caused by a string change.  Note that other applications are using it.

Please do file a bug about figuring out where should this code live. I agree that migration.properties dependency is just as bad as MigrationUtils dependency.

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): bug 737381
User impact if declined: history will not be included in the list of preserved data for a reset (which may deter users).
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Verified on Nightly 20120530
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low risk. Using migrationutils API rather than relying directly on strings.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: Deletion of unused 32_firefox.
We're looking to approve this, but want to double check with Axel whether anything needs to be done around the string removal before landing.
Per IRC, please don't approve attachment 620856, it's not doing what it should. Notably, it relies on strings in l10n not being there (32_firefox), which we can't guarantee.
Comment on attachment 620856
v.2 Use new MigrationUtils.getLocalizedString to handle string overrides (Cu.import in getMigratedData)

as per Axel's comment above, not approving for aurora.
My understanding is that this feature is only available through about:support in FF14. SUMO and SUMO users will be the main consumer of this feature for this cycle. Given that, this isn't a blocker in my eyes. Please re-nominate if you disagree.

That being said, if a low risk solution was found (english only?), we'd definitely approve.

Why not just leave the string on beta? Removing it will cause confusion, which seems like more trouble than it's worth.

v.3 (m-c/15) Don't depend on the existence of the string (based on IRC discussion)

Why is this code using "checkbox" as a variable containing a label element? :)

Maybe you should put a note in migration.properties that suggests making sure the hardcoded list in resetProfile.js is up to date?

[Triage Comment]
Approving for Beta 14. If we see any major regressions, we'll either disable for our final mozilla-release build or advise SUMO not to use the feature.

Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): bug 737381 + l10n fallout from attachment 620856 which landed on m-c and migrated to aurora.
User impact if declined: bookmarks may be included twice in the list of preserved data for a reset in some locales if they don't delete the 32_firefox string. (Translated once from "Bookmarks" and again from "History and Bookmarks").
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Local build and pushed to inbound today.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low risk. Using a list of strings rather than assuming existence of string implies it's migrated.
