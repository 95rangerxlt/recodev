Ideally we would like bug 674925 fixed, but for now a new indicator is indeed needed.

Stephen, how is this? The screenshot shows the indicator between two background tabs and beside a foreground tab.

Stephen says that this is fine, but he prefers the dropmarker over the selected tab, not under the tab.

We select the dragged tab post-drag, so that makes sense to me too.
In the long term, we'd want to do something more like Safari — creating a space for the dragged tab, etc. — but that's really not necesssary for Australis.

v.1 Adjust position and z-index of the dropmarker

The z-index was adjusted so that the dropmarker appears above the selected tab (z-index: 2). On Windows and Linux we use an arrow on the bottom and I just made that slightly overlap the bottom border of the tabstrip.
