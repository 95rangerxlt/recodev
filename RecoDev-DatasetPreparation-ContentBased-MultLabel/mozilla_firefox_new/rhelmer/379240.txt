Fx/Tb - moz180-branch-patcher2.cfg changes

Notes:
 - shipped-locales unchanged for both apps
 - I changed testurl to betatest-url in the Tb -> complete-update -> partial. This seemed to be the odd one out

Fx/Tb - moz180-branch-patcher2.cfg changes for RC2

Updates for RC1 were never generated, so the previous patch is obsolete. Changes from that to this one are s/rc1/rc2/ in appropriate places, and updated BuildIDs.

Fx/Tb - moz180-branch-patcher2.cfg changes for RC2 - add beta

Apparently we are going to push RCs on beta to the 1.5.0.x apps as well as 2.0.0.4

Sorry, I had beta instead of beta-url in one place.

Tb - moz180-branch-patcher2.cfg changes for RC2 - take V - bouncer1

Apologies for the churn here, but we need this to fix the snippets for the release tomorrow. The ones waiting on the staging box use bouncer2, and we need to undo the parts of the config that generate snippets for the beta channel.

We can probably get IT to create a CNAME for bouncer2, but then I don't see that being fixed here.

Why?

Yah, for Thunderbird 1.8.0-branch, this makes sense; you might include in the comment that you removed these because they were never used, and you're just updating the config to reflect that. That's what I was missing.

bump 15012 block for yahoo

Patch looks good. I had a look at the rest of the config to do the review, and this doesn't right:
(release block for 1.5.0.12):

    <platforms>
      win32      = 2007050903
      linux-i686 = 2007050903
      mac        = 2007050815
    </platforms>

Only the mac one is right, use 2007050813 for the other two I think.
