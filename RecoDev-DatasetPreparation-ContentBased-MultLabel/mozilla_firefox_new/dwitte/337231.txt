The Opera profile migrator is currently migrating the Opera preference "Accept Cookies Session Only" into the preference network.cookie.enableForCurrentSessionOnly. That preference is unused; it has been replaced by network.cookie.lifetimePolicy.

The migrator should set a lifetimePolicy value of 2 (Accept for session only) when Opera's pref is true and a value of 0 (use supplied value [the default]) when Opera's pref is false.

Was this bug filed against the Firefox migrator, or something else??
I didn't realize there was a Firefox-specific migrator...
