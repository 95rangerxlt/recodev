View bookmarks sidebar and Subscribe this page should be aligned with other items like in the subview and like every other widgets since bug 938578 has landed.
Also note that the Sidebar opened state is wrong in the panel.

I'm confused. Are you saying this broke because of bug 938578, or just that it wasn't fixed?
Sorry I wasn't clear. First it hasn't been fixed by bug 938578. The bookmarks panel is the only one that hasn't its items aligned on the left. Secondly when the bookmarks sidebar is enabled the "View Bookmarks sidebar" is aligned to the left and has no checkbox which its strange.
OK, but then this shouldn't block the other bug, which was about separators... let's instead make it block the polish bug.

Bug 938578 was indeed about separators but it also contains the left alignment...

bug972405.patch

Okay.  So.

Bug XXX changed:
#BMB_bookmarksPopup > menuitem[checked="true"]::before
to:
.PanelUI-subView menuitem[checked="true"]::before
but, the BMB_bookmarksPopup isn't a PanelUI-subView, so it doesn't pick up any of the styling, and notably is now missing the checkmark.  This patch fixes that.

I think this works, but Mike might have a better idea. Is there any reason we shouldn't do this? :-)
On the Windows screenshot the first two items ("View bookmarks sidebar" and "Subscribe to this page") are still not aligned properly.

The "View Bookmarks Sidebar" label shifts out of alignment when it is checked:

Could you also please use the menu checkmark?

Thanks!
In fact the Subscribe item should always have an icon but greyed out when disabled.
*** Bug 973509 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
As far as the _summary_ of this bug is concerned, I think Gijs' patch is a step in the right direction. I don't really get how checkmarks got dragged into this.

If we still want to address that here, plz update the summary. Otherwise I'd rather see that work moved to a more appropriate bug. Also note that the check marks we currently use in the panel are Unicode characters, not images.

Gijs, it's up to you if you also want to address the check mark _alignment_ here. I think we'll be doing a more 'final pass' over all our panels and subviews soon, however.

Borrow the PanelUI-subView styling, and make the checkbox line up.

Fixed the alignment (on OS X, will check on Windows next).
Switching to the menu checkmark will be a bit more involved, and it would be nice to get this in first, so I'm going to try to tackle that in a separate patch.  (Possibly attached to a separate bug.)

This looks like it breaks checkmarks for the toolbarbuttons in the main menu panel.

text-align:center doesn't seem useful if there's no flex.

This should probably move to xul.css rather than being an inline style.

Doesn't this add PanelUI-subView even if this opens from the toolbar rather than as a sub view in the panel? Doesn't seem to make much sense in that case.

Now you shouldn't need the !important anymore.

Can you do this for both menuitem and menu? Inconsistency doesn't help here.

Yes, but it makes it like #PanelUI-history and #PanelUI-developer, both of which have the PanelUI-subView class when opened from the toolbar.  (My whole purpose in adding it was to make it like those, so that we can style everything once and have it all be the same.  :)

The consistency is of little value if the whole approach is wrong in the first place. I don't know what the right solution is here, maybe the class just needs to be renamed or a separate class should be added. In any case, I'd like to at least see a bug filed before I r+ something that essentially looks wrong.
Filed bug 978881, to make the bookmarks panel an actual panel, instead of a menu that tries to look like a panel.

How does this bug relate to the issue of PanelUI-subView being used on what isn't a sub view?
We'll rename the class when we make it an actual panel.
In the interests of moving this bug forward, I've also filed bug 978922.

So, I'm happy to make that change (and indeed, here's that version), but aren't you concerned that that might catch things with a class of menu-text in add-ons?

Since I'm not that concerned, I'll let you pick which version to mark obsolete and which to check in.  :)

Thanks,
Blake.

I'll likely be futzing with the alignment as part of bug 979378, so let's leave this one resolved, and do the extra work there.

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Australis
User impact if declined: bookmarks menu panel menu items don't look right
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): on m-c for quite a while
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): medium. There are some known issues, but this and the other patches to the bookmarks panel make the overall situation better, IMO, and so it's either moving forward with all of them or keeping Aurora frozen (in a pretty non-ideal state). At this point I think moving forward is less risky than not taking these patches
