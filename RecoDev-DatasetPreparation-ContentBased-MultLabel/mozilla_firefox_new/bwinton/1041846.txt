Story: As a product owner I want to measure how recent changes to organic search flows in Firefox impact user behavior so that I can assess whether the changes delivered meaningful results.  

Acceptance critiera: 
With the help of the metrics team...
*Deliver a plan to measure user engagement with the recent addition of search suggestions to about:home and about:newtab.  How frequently are these new features being used?  (bug 612943 and bug 1028985)
*Deliver a plan to measure how many malformed URIs result in search results now that we try to interpret them as searches. (bug 982848)

Hi Blake, can you provide a point value for this bug.
I'll go for 3 points.
Chad, how does http://people.mozilla.org/~bwinton/temp/search/measuring.html look as a first pass at the measurement plan?  What parts would you like me to expand on, what parts would you like me to remove?
Christina,

Can you confirm that the methods described in Blake's link in comment 3 are consistent with where we last left this conversation?  

Thanks!
Chad,

- I'm not sure about UITelemetry part (Blake, we should talk about this)
- From FHR, we look at the ratio of URL searches to total searches before and after changes are made, to see if bogus protocol had an impact
- For future changes such as search suggestions on new tab or about home, we will need to confirm that they are being recorded in FHR, as well as what field it is being recorded under

Cheers,
Christina
Christina,

We should talk about the UITelemetry part!  I'll schedule a meeting!

Thanks!  :)
Got some notes from Christina, which I will incorporate into the document.
Resolving this as fixed, in the meantime.  :)
