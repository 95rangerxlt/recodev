STR:

Pass an argument to "subtitles_src" in the FB embedding. I used /examples/videoplayer/big_buck_bunny.srt

Watch the video and press ALT+B to see the bounds. They are not fitted to the subtitle text.
Tobias says we have the same issue in JWPlayer.
Fixed in https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2080.


Subtitle text bounds are not calculated correctly.
