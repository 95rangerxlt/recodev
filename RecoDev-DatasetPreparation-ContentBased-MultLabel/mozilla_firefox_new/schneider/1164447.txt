We definitely want to have telemetry working before landing on Nightly. Yury, is this fixed? I vaguely remember something about that.
There issue is not fixed (and there is still a risk something else can be removed), however I introduced in the master `arguments.length;` statement in the function as workaround to prevent code from its removal.
Fixed in https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2319.
