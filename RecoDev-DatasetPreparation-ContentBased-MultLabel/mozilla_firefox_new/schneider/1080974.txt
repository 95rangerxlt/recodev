AVM1 error: ArgumentError: Error #2109: Frame label on not found in scene null.
Some of the animations are failing because of morph shapes.

(per #50) mark_mc (Sprite 22) is missing the "on" label, so this warning is correct. (If it's run in the inspector, please turn off AVM1 "errorsAvm1" option to continue execution)
#15,21,25,47,46 fixed by implementing morph shapes (bug 1063400). Bug 1085473 created for the remaining issue in #50.


SWF #15,21,25,47,46 Incorrect rendering, animation.
