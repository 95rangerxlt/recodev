To play back embedded videos, we need to restore an FLV buffer from the tags embedded in a SWF. To be able to play back a streaming video before it has been fully loaded, we should do the combining into a complete buffer in the FLV player. In Shumway, we just need to be able to extract the data and pass it out for processing. Because video data is large, we shouldn't store it anywhere. Instead, they should be extracted on demand and passed over to the vp6 player immediately. (I'm assuming that we need to transmit more than one at a time to keep the media playback pipeline fed, but am not sure about that.)

For this bug, the idea is to put everything into place for retrieving the right tags and sending them out to the FLV player.

Addressed in https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2318, waiting for review.
