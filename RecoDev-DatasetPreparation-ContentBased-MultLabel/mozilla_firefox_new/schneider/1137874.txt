Our current automated testing doesn't test the extension at all. This has led to various regressions that were only caught later on.

We should run our reftests with the extension in /botio reftest to fix this.

I think I'd like "smiler.js" better, but alas, that's not the name of what I meant.
Tobias says slimer.js isn't a good fit, but Marionette is.
Decided to neither using Slimer nor Marionette. Gonna tweak our existing testing harness to optionally run all our tests through the extension.
Landed in https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2296.
