Reproducible: Always

confirming... there seem to be 3 appearances for tabs... one active and two
inactive. I haven't yet nailed a pattern on why each disabled tab gets the
appearance it does tho.
well, in my experience, the two tabs adjacent to the selected one are drawn
without any borders and the rest are drawn normally.  you can see this if you
open several (say, five) tabs and select one(s) in the middle.

picture of "missing" tabs

Here is a screenshot of the "missing" tab behaviour. As you can see the tabs
adjacent to the active tab do not have their "tab" rendered. Only the title of
the tab is displayed.
with certain themes, in addition to "missing" tabs, you also get "missing"
scroll bars.
Very very annoying.
upping severity based on scrollbar issue
Taking QA Contact, sorry for bugspam
I'm not a mac nut, but please take a look at the pictures in bug 175656 and tell
me if those look familiar for rhis problem. I think this bug is a dupe of bug
175656.
that bug has to do with the spacing of the tabs, whereas this one has to do with
the actual rendering of the tabs (they are not colored and shaded correctly).  i
doubt they are related.
This problem is still present in build 20030827 [Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X
Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030827 Mozilla
Firebird/0.6.1+/jtalkington-nightly]. Will this be fixed by moving to the
Pinstripe theme as the default in OS X?
