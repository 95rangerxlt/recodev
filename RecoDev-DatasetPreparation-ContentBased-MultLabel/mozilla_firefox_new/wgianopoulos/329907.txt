Since the landing of the patch for bug 329586 it is no longer possible to run a build with places disabled.  Since this patch added a lot of ifdef's and ifndef's for MOZ_PLACES, I am assuming that it was not intended to break non-places builds.

The following error window occurs upon startup.

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
Line Number 891, Column 17:
                <menuitem id="bookmarkAllCmd"

add the string back to the dtd file.

This resolves the issue, however it might be better to modify the code to use the new string name.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
