The banner text is neither centered vertically across the banner nor does it have larger top padding than bottom padding as is more conventional.  The way it is just looks wrong.

fwiw, the original page (http://www.google.it/firefox/) has text in the same position, not centered and with more padding below. Since the request was to copy the original page and wait for a new design, that was not changed. But this is a welcome change.
