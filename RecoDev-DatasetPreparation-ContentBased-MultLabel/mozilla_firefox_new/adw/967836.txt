1) Apply a lightweight theme
2) Enter customize mode, and re-enable the titlebar

ER:

The titlebar should be the same height as it is without a lightweight theme.

AR:

The titlebar is slightly shorter. This effect is amplified when opening a pop-up window (with or without tabs in titlebar disabled).

This growing set of hard-coded titlebar values is a little disturbing, but I guess I made the bed - I might as well lie in it. :)

I think this works. I ran it through tests with customize mode, tabs in titlebar on and off, with and without lightweight themes, and opening popups. Works as advertised.

Down the road, I'd really like to make our titlebar stuff smarter, but for now, let's go with this.
We'll also want to land this on Aurora once it's had some time to bake on central.

I'm not clear what is the difference between a lightweight theme and non-lightweight theme but am posting verification results.

In Aurora, I applied the theme, Dragonflies in Maple Tree (by MaDonna).
The tabs don't appear to be too close to the window controls in the main window.
But when I test on Mike Conley's test popup (https://bug967836.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8370335) with no tabs, the address bar is close to the window controls (the title bar seems a little smaller).

I'm not clear whether the fix is good enough to say it is verified.

This screenshot, if compared to attachment 8404144, does appear to have a shorter titlebar. I saw a similar result when I tried with 2 other popular themes.
Oh, I googled lightweight theme and found some information. I will look into it and then try to retest this.

This image shows a screen comparison:
Right: Aurora with lightweight theme applied. Popup without tabs.
Left: Aurora with no theme applied. Popup without tabs.

The heights of the window control and the titlebar area appear to be the same on each screen. If you look really carefully on the left, you can see that the border around the address text box is the same height as on the right.
