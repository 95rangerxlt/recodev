browser_thumbnails_background.js is really unreliable, particularly on Linux. See dependent bugs.

As such, it has been disabled on Linux for now.

This splits up the test like we talked about.  It also:

* Modifies the bg tests to use helpers in head.js instead of their own where
  possible
* Adds helpers to head.js
* Modifies next() and TestRunner.next() in head.js to take arguments and pass
  them to the yielder via _iter.send()
* Drops the privateBrowsingActive and openPrivateWindowDuringCapture tests
  since I don't think they're useful anymore, but if you'd like, I can add
  them back
iter.send(undefined) works on a newborn iterator, so this head.js change:

>       let value = aValue ? TestRunner._iter.send(aValue) :
>                   TestRunner._iter.next();

can be this instead, since TestRunner.run() calls this.next() with no arguments:

>       let value = TestRunner._iter.send(aValue);

I'll batch that change with any other comments you might have.

looks good, sorry for the earlier confusion.

yeah, the simpler version you mentioned would be better.

split 'r up (for check-in)

Tryserver didn't show any oranges that weren't already there, so this is ready to land.  After that, I think this bug can be closed and new bugs filed against any new failing tests if necessary.
Er, I forgot about the many dependent bugs.  I think each can be rescoped to whatever test file they now happen to be failing in.

Is there any help needed for manual testing?
No.
