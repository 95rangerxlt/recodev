Bug 587908 broke the location bar while using a persona on Windows: the current URL text is dimmed and the over-link overlaps the current URL.  Luckily the fix is one line of CSS that I screwed up in bug 587908.

This should block final, maybe beta 7?
I hope it blocks b7, because the text is mostly unreadable with a Persona, and I thought it was by design! (so most likely users will think the same).
I tested the fix and does indeed fix the problem.
Thanks guys!
