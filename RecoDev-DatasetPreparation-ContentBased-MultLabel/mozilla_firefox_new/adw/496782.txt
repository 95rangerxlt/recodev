I discovered this while working on bug 492467. That patch changes the browser chrome test harness to output test results as they are generated, instead of lumping them all together in one big dump() at the end.

browser_sanitizeDialog.js seems to be calling finish() twice, and running tests after the first call to finish() (i.e. after we've run a few subsequent tests). The problem here seems to be the last test specifically, which triggers two window openings.

One easy way to see the problem is to add a dump() next to the tests call to finish(), and then run only that test:
runtests.py --browser-chrome --test-path=browser/base/content/test/browser_sanitizeDialog.js --autorun

You'll see the dump() output twice in the log results, once before the log output (i.e. before the first call to finish()) and once after.

Whoops, that last test was added later, and I forgot how my own test works. :O  The problem is that each time the CRH window is closed, doNextTest() is automatically called, which calls finish() if there are no more tests.  The last test opens the window twice => two window closings & no more tests either time => double the finish().  This patch simply breaks the test in two.

Makes sense - I've tested this and it does solve the issue.

I think Gavin's review is sufficient...?
Yeah, just wasn't sure whether you cared that johnath look at it specifically.
