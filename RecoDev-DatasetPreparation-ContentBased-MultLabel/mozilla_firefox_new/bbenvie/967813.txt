To make it so we can integrate tern into the devtools without modifying its source, we have to supply acorn at the require path "acorn/acorn" instead of the shortcut "acorn" we currently have. It also depends on acorn/util/walk.js which we haven't needed until now.

This patch changes it so you have to require "acorn/acorn" or "acorn/acorn_loose". It also adds "acorn/util/walk.js".

The way I've added walk.js is kind of ugly: it lives in the root acorn directory and there's an alias in the devtools loader that maps it to "acorn/util/walk". The other option is to create the "util" directory and put a moz.build file in there (as far as I can tell you can't add subdirectory paths to a moz.build). Both ways have their drawbacks.

It's unfortunate that integrating third party libraries that have anything besides a flat directory structure turns ugly.

Actually add walk.js and add the path mapping to SrcdirProvider.

Update UPGRADING.md as well.

Let me know what you think about which way to do this (loader path alias vs. adding another directory + moz.build).
I just realized that I changed pretty-fast.js which would need to be upstreamed.

So no more loose parser?

Can we just remove this step if we are removing acorn_loose from the loader?

Shouldn't this fail b/c of loader changes now?

Does this still work with running pretty-fast's tests from the command line via |npm test|?

As you mentioned would need to go upstream too.

It's still there. The loader correctly resolves "acorn/acorn_loose" to "resource://gre/modules/devtools/acorn/acorn_loose.js".

I don't have any intention of removing acorn_loose. We could, since we're not currently using it, but that wasn't an intention of this patch.

All the tests pass. These paths resolve to the correct resource path.

The pretty-fast devtools tests pass. I only realized after pinging the r? from you that I made changes that needed to be upstreamed (and tested as part of that process).
Ah ok, I missed that acorn points to the directory, thought it was still the js file.
