Recent versions of acorn began exporting a couple useful functions (isIdentifierStart, isIdentifierChar). These are used by the tern CodeMirror plugin.

I guess this will need a sec review as well.

What am I supposed to do with this? The diff is literally everything on both and I just don't know what proper protocol is in this situation. Do we need a new secreview? Should I look at the whole file again? Do we just wait for a green try?
Yeah I was trying to figure out why the diff wouldn't come out more piecemeal. It's like it just gives up if there's too many changes. We're actually upgrading pretty far, from 0.1.01 to 0.4. I'll try and get a more useful diff.

Here's a better diff.
On second look, I don't think this needs a sec-review.
