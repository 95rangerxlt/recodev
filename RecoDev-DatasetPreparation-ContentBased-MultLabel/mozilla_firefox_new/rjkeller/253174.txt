Good catch Steffen! I'm really happy to see that you've been pressing hard on
the help documentation! It has definetely increased the quality of the Firefox
Help documentation.

If you see any minor typos or code errors like this, feel free to fix them
yourself. You went through so much effort getting the infromation for this bug,
it might've been easier for you to fix it. Typos/code errors in the
documentation don't require review for checkin, only word modifications.
Thanks, R.J. I'll do that in the future.
