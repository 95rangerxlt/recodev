We have two handlers for the WebNavigation:LoadURI message. One is in browser/base/content/content.js, and it just handles WebNavigation:LoadURI. The other one is in toolkit/content/browser-child.js.

Having two handlers causes an annoying problem whenever a URL is loaded. The first handler starts the load. Then the second handler cancels it and starts it again. When we cancel the first load, the WebProgressListener in the child sends a message to the parent, which acts as if the user hit the stop button. There's some code there that resets the URL bar to match the current page URI. If the load was initiated from the URL bar, it will be overwritten with the old URL until we actually get the onLocationChanged message, which will change the URL back to the new one. The overall effect is pretty bad.

This patch removes the listener in content.js. One thing I'm not sure of is whether WebNavigation:LoadURI is used for anything besides e10s. The browser-child.js code is only loaded for remote browsers, so there's a potential problem if anyone else needs the content.js listener. As far as I can tell, though, the original code was added for e10s, and no one else is using it.

Looks fine, nothing else appears to be using it. It's just something we forgot to remove when implementing browser-child.js

I'm just worried about removing the note about Bug 671101.. I'll go back to that bug to see if it's still reproducible and try to get some traction there, or resolve it as invalid if it doesn't happen anymore.
