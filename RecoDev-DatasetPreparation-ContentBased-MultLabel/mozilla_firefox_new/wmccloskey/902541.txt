Now that bug 897066, the remote attribute of the first tab will automatically be enabled when we load the about:home URL (or whatever the first URL is). So it's no longer necessary to set the remote attribute in the tabbrowser.xml constructor.

Also, flipping the attribute before the first paint seems to cause problems on Macs because of a bug in graphics code (bug 886988). So this is also a workaround for that bug, which seems to be stuck at the moment. It's cleaner this way anyway though.
