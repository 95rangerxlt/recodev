This binding was only designed to be used for electrolysis browsing. It uses CPOWs and stuff that should be unavailable except when browser.tabs.remote is set.

You could avoid adding the class and just use "browserStack > browser" as the selector for CSS. I think I prefer that.

Yeah, that's much better.

Hmm, thinking about this a bit further, given the location of this style rule, it would not have been applied to the background thumbnailing service's browsers, because those live in the hidden window (where browser.css is not loaded). So I don't think this is related to bug 800347, and it shouldn't really change much in practice. But I guess it doesn't hurt to do it anyways.
