Need to replace non-standard for-each with one of:
  * for-of
  * for-in
  * array.map/array.filter for array-comprehension
as a part of bug 1083470.

converting rules are following:
  * for-each
    * for each (let x in array) { ... }
      -> for (let x of array) { ... }
    * for each (let x in object) { ... }
      -> for (let key in object) { let x = object[key]; ... }
    * for each (let [key, value] in Iterator(object)) { ... }
      -> for (let key in object) { let value = object[key]; ... }
    * for each (let x in array) { ... }
      where array can be null or undefined
      -> if (array) { for (let x of array) { ... } }

  * legacy array comprehension with for-each
    (newer array comprehension is now also a non-standard feature, I'd like to go with map/filter)
    * [EXPR for each (x in array)]
      -> array.map(x => EXPR)
    * [EXPR for each (x in array) if (COND)]
      -> array.filter(x => COND).map(x => EXPR)
    * [x for each (x in array) if (COND)]
      -> array.filter(x => COND)
    * [EXPR for each ([i, x] in Iterator(array)) if (g(x, i)]
      -> array.filter((x, i) => g(x, i)).map((x => EXPR)
    * [EXPR for each (x in arraylike)]
      -> Array.from(arraylike).map(x => EXPR)
    * [EXPR for each (x in string)]
      -> Array.prototype.slice.call(string).map(x => EXPR)
         // Array.from behaves differently for surrogate-pair

realistically this code should be removed, but whatever for now
