tracking bug for deer park release
Why is this bug needed? How is it different from bug 290383?
because the idea is to tier the various tasks, just because this is all in one
bug (bug 179656) doesn't mean there aren't others that have more.  See the
dependency tree for bug 290383 for how this is working.
