We don't 'officially' support query sub menu yet though (this is all broken on mac, for example)
mozilla/browser/components/places/content/menu.xml 1.82
verified with: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007072505 Minefield/3.0a7pre

can we get a unit test for this one? or not applicable since it's unsupported.
broken again with the hourly build from 19-11-2007 18:12
last working build is the one from 17:22

File a new bug.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
