after 20060824 Trunk Hourly Build (maybe after bug#349225 check-in),
default feed reader list in preferences panel was disappeared.

in about:config,
there are Bloglines, My Yahoo and google reader.

but in preferences panel, they are not displayed.
so cannot use/choose a feed reader.

and in error console,
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIPrefBranch.getComplexValue]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Firefox30/components/WebContentConverter.js :: anonymous :: line 525"  data: no]
Source File: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Firefox30/components/WebContentConverter.js
Line: 525

if this is an intended one, please fix bug#350133
