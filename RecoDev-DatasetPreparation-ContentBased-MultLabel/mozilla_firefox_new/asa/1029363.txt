In https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/5e0288a4e398 I changed browser_translation_fhr.js to check the _additions_ to each metrics after each test. At first, I set the initial values to compare with to zeros. That worked when I ran the test on its own, but obviously failed when brosser_translation_infobar.js ran first. So, I removed the initial (zero) values, and just called updateMetrics in the setup method. That fixed the multiple tests case, in exchange for breaking the sole test one, because updateMetrics fails to find any initial values. And if it fails, it think it's because it's midnight ("Getting metrics around midnight may fail sometimes").

A "proper" solution is an overkill, I think. So I'm going to fix this by running some translation in the setup method. That way, the test will always run as if it's running after some other translation test did, leaving some metrics in place.

I don't think we should reference the bug here, that just makes it seem like there's a remaining issue.
