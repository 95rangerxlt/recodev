asaf, my apologies for busting RTL here, and thank you for fixing it!

For ff2, are we going to be fixing pinstripe for RTL?

No.
1.8 branch:
mozilla/toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/globalBindings.xml 1.3.24.3
mozilla/toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/jar.mn 1.14.2.9
asaf, I have made more changes to fix some issues with the RTL tabstrip styling.  

specifically, I have additional rules to fix tab-image-left when in RTL (and the tab is not selected)

see the patch bug #350690 (which contains the fix for that RTL issue.)

Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).
