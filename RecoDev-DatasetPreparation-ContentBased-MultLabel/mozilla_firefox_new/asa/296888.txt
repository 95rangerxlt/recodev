For the nightly builds, and the Deer Park Alpha 2, I'd like the reporter tool to
be enabled with the default install. We're seeing a good response in Alpha 1
with the tool not enabled by default and not well advertised but we can do a lot
better if we get it enabled by default.

(note, this is enabled by default in the Mac bundle since we have no installer
there)

I've had this patch for about a week, and have been meaning to attach it. I
guess now is as good a time as any :)

This also fixes a little buglet: the windows installer using the short
description of the reporter component where it should have been using the long
one.

I haven't yet tested this patch on windows, but I'll be able to do so later on
tonight.
