The async loading is used in the extension (I added simulation of that in pull request #1919, see fileReadChunkSize).

STR:
1. Open inspector at http://localhost:8000/examples/inspector/inspector.html?rfile=../racing/race3.swf
2. Set fileReadChunkSize to 10000, and refresh

Expected result:

racing game works

Actual result:

game execution breaks -- the execution started without the root (= null) at https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/blob/master/src/player/player.ts#L186
