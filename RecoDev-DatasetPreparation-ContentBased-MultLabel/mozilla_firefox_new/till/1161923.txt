Can the list of implemented and unimplemented AS APIs be generated automatically?

Can the list of implemented and unimplemented AS APIs be generated automatically?
Till, did you already complete this list of unimplemented Flash functionality? Where should we publish the list?
I think the list is pretty complete, yes. I'm sure I forgot some things and would appreciate feedback or edits, but otherwise this should be done.

It's published on the github wiki for now: https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/wiki/Missing-features

The formatting sucks about as much as it possibly could and there's not TOC, so if you've got any ideas for where to publish this instead, I'd be all ears. (One option might be readthedocs, but I don't know the process that'd be involved.)
