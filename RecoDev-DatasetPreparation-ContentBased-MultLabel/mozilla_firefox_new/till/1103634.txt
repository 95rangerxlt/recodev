E4X objects are compared structurally, not by identity, but only when using the non-strict comparison operators. To make that possible, we have to emit a call to `asEquals` instead of just emitting `==`/`!=` whenever we cannot proof that at least one operand cannot be an E4X object.

Patches forthcoming.

This turned out quite nicely, I think.


Use structural comparison for E4X objects
