Pull request for fix

For methods/accessors which we don't need to compile, we can do the binding to make them available to content eagerly instead of installing placeholders (called trampolines) first that trigger compilation on first access.

Filing bug after the fact because startup and runtime performance plus memory usage are important, so this should be tracked.

And again, already fixed.
