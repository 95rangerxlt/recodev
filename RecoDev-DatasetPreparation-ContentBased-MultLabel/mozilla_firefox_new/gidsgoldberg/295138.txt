There needs to be documentation for the 'Report Broken Website' option, at least
in the Menu Reference help file.
I'm trying to work on this, I've got a patch for menureference.xhtml, but I
can't find the file where the the help contents list is stored.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/help/firebird-toc.rdf
looked promising, though it doesn't seem to be the latest version as Promote
Firefox is not included. A lxr search for 'promote firefox' doesn't seem to pick
up anything. 
Can anyone advise?
Sorry, cleared this up on IRC, I'll try to post a patch this evening.

Please use the same level of indentation (2 spaces) as above and below, and
wrap around 80 characters. Also, the Report menu item is below Release Notes,
not above it; you did it right in the toc.

Fixes Steffen's points (hopefully.)

Please add the <p> </p> tags back in. I think the wording is ok, but I'd like
to hear Jeff's opinion.

Spaces instead of the tab, please.

Sorry for minusing another patch. Your help is appreciated.

...and again. No tabs, also changed to read 'web sites' to follow convention.

I asked Robert about this text, and he though it looked good.  On the nitpicky
side, you also needed to indent the second line by an additional two spaces,
but that's fixable on checkin.

>+        <rdf:li> <rdf:Description ID="menu-help-report-broken-web-site" nc:name="Report Broken Web Site"        nc:link="menu_reference.xhtml#reporter"/> </rdf:li>

You don't need the extra spaces between the nc:name and nc:link attributes, but
once again, that's fixable at checkin.
I should note that reporter is not in the default install, and is an option at
this time (we don't know how wide or inclusive deployment will be).

It may be wise to note "if installed", unless you plan to only show this
documentation when reporter is detected.

That's not correct. The Reporter checkbox is checked in custom installs, and bug
296888 just made it install by default in standard installs.

So if you don't want Reporter to be installed, you have to choose custom
install, and deselect its checkbox.

We don't know what's happening after Deer Park alpha 2.  So I warn against
insisting it's installed in Firefox 1.1, since that has yet to be decided.
-> Gids.
Checked in, with whitespace fixed.

We can remove this if Reporter won't be included in the 1.1 default install.
Removing something is always easier than adding it.
