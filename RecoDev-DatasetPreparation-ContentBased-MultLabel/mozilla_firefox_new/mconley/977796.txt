This is being split off from bug 974607.

Subpixel anti-aliasing is expensive on Windows when we're using Direct2D layers acceleration. This is contributing to the slow painting during the customize mode transition.

We can work around this by temporarily defeating subpixel anti-aliasing during the transition.

This compare talos shows the result of doing so:

http://compare-talos.mattn.ca/?oldRevs=21e77b801df3&newRev=b5d485143452&server=graphs.mozilla.org&submit=true

This should be a nice perf win for the transition on Windows.

Note that I also tested this on OS X and Linux, and didn't see the same improvements (in fact, it made things worse[1]), which is why I'm only going to try this for Windows.

Thank you for investigating this, it looks to be a pretty good boost based on your compare-talos link in comment #0.

Please please please include an explanation of why this is necessary. `blame` exists, but this will look really weird to the casual code peruser.

Secondly, instead of using a tag name here, can we reference one of the CSS classes that is causing the issue? I would suspect it is `.toolbarbutton-multiline-text`.

Very good call. I'll add a note.

Almost all of the text is causing the issue, including:

1) Selected tab label
2) Menu panel item labels
3) Menu panel footer item labels
4) Palette item labels
5) The header text for customize mode
6) The items in the footer for the palette

Did you want me to add more selectors so that I target all of these individually?

Also, can we use something like perspective(0.01px) ?

Hm, I'm just worried about the cost of this rule. Let's keep this as-is for now, since as you've mentioned it is quite hard to catch all of the cases (.toolbarbutton-text, .toolbarbutton-multiline-text would cover the majority of the text though).

Sounds good!

Added some documentation, and switched to perspective(0.01px).
remote:   https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/a267ac44d506

Feels good to land a patch!
The patch you landed didn't change the perspective to 0.01px. Maybe you forgot to qref? Also, we should keep an eye on the CART tests to make sure that this does as comment #0 said it would do.
Also, no documentation.

Ugh, whoops. I forgot how to qref.

This descendent selector is kind of crazy. Can you not apply the transform to some large container (e.g. #main-window) rather than every single label?

It doesn't seem like it - from the looks of it, I have to apply the transform directly to the element with the text in it in order to trick Layout into thinking that the colour behind the text might be transparent.

Applying the transform to the main-window, or any of the other parent elements of those labels doesn't seem to be enough to fool Layout and defeat subpixel AA.

Open to suggestions though.
Ugh, I didn't notice but my comment for the corrected landing got midaired.

Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): 

Australis


User impact if declined: 

A slower customization mode transition.


Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): 

Baking on mozilla-central for a day, and extensive local testing.


Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): 

Very, very little. It is just CSS, and the rule only applies for a 150ms window.

None.
Uh, whoops - I thought Sylvestre approved these, so it's a=sledru on the commit message. My bad.
