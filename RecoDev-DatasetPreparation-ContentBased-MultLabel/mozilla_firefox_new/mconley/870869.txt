It might be a more elegant approach since it may not be obvious to a user why the "restore default" button is disabled.

Just checkpointing some work here - but this should be enough to show the direction I'm going.

Hey Gijs, feel comfortable reviewing this?

Generally, this looks good. However, the bug summary says 'disabled' and you're hiding the button. Did we change our mind? If not, I'm afraid that'd make this an r-. If we did, read on. :-)

Have you tested what happens if add-ons insert stuff using DOM manipulation or XUL overlays? From my reading of the patch, the code will still believe we're in default state. I'd argue we probably do care about this case? OTOH, even if we were to remove the custom added stuff, it'd likely be back on browser restart... so that's a tricky case. If my reasoning seems correct to you, can you file a followup bug for that?

At the moment, this won't fire when you click the button. We should be careful that that does happen after bug 870011 is fixed (I could imagine it'll restore state in a way that might not trigger this).

Ah, I missed comment #1. I'm not sure I agree; I could also be wondering where the "Restore Default" button is if it's not visible. I think if we think that either user worry is likely, maybe we could replace the button with some text that says something along the lines of "Your Firefox is in its default state. Customize away!" (to be wordsmithed by someone better at that than I am, obvs.) ? Don't feel strongly either way, but may want to ask UX...
shorlander said that he preferred hiding it in IRC, so I'll go that route.
Thanks Gijs, Landed on UX: https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/045da4704a6a
Setting .hidden=true will cause the element to be display:none.

This patch should have used .style.visibility="hidden" so that the containing <hbox> doesn't shrink to a height of 0. Keeping the height unchanged will be important to making sure that the positions of items in the palette don't shift when the button changes visibility state.
Had to land a follow-up because the resetButton getter was using the wrong element ID. :/

And https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/21686fd23a10, which had the wrong bug #. Oops.
We no longer hide the button when the state is default, we just disable the button.
