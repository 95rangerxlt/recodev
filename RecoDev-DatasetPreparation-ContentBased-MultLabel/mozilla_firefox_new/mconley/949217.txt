Extra toolbars include:

1) Add-on supplied toolbars
2) Toolbars added via the "Add New Toolbar" option in pre-Australis customize mode.

We probably want counts for each.

Tentative r=me as long as you look in to the possibility about breaking an assumption that a different probe is making in regards to the absence of the toolbar-menubar on OSX.

Is changing this going to break some numbers for one of the other probes?

This comment seems redundant as it describes *what* the code is doing. A comment here would only be necessary/useful if it described *why* this code was needed, but in this case I think it is pretty straight-forward.

No - the menubar is actually there on OS X, it's just hidden. The only thing that this will affect is that menubar-items is going to appear in the defaultKept items for OS X, which I think is OK. If UX / UR is not interested in that, we can still filter it out in post since we know which OS the ping came from.

Yeah, good call. This comment adds nothing - just me chattering. I'll remove it.

Are we going to be able to connect one number to another? In my experience with telemetry we were not able to know how two different probes intersected unless the probe was designed to intersect values from the beginning.
I don't think I understand the question. Can you please re-phrase?
Talked over IRC. My question is not an issue to worry about.

Patch v1 - for Australis

The Australis port was basically a re-write, but a simple one thankfully. I took the occasion to rename DEFAULT_TOOLBAR_PLACEMENTS to DEFAULT_AREA_PLACEMENTS, which makes much more sense.
