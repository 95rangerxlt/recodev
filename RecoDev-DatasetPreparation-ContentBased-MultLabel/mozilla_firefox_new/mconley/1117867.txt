yep
FWIW I don't think we get much value out of this Nightly baking. Seems fine to me to have the first week or so of Aurora potentially be bumpy.
Thanks felipe!

Sorry I never got back to you about this, gavin - I asked in the e10s meeting about this, and the response was that this is something that release management wanted. I think lmandel might be who you want to talk to about this.


Disable e10s on 01/06



Bug 1117867 - Disable e10s by default for a week of non-e10s testing on Nightly. r=felipe.
