Patch v1

How's my driving?
Does this also cover removing the dupe widgets (cut/copy/paste, Zoom) and the "activity" indicator ?

I only meant to remove the obviously dummy widgets in this patch (the demo widgets that don't really do anything), and make the default set in the panel more or less work as expected.

For Cut/Copy/Paste, we still need to de-dupe those, and nobody has started on that yet. I think we should leave them for now. For the activity throbber... maybe we could remove that at the same time as the old cut/copy/paste buttons. A general clean-out. :)
