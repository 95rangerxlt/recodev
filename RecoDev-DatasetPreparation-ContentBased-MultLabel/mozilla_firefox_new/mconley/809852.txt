WIP Patch 1

This patch allows the user to key down to the summary node when pressing the down button on the last item in the downloads list.

Pressing up when the summary node is focused will re-focus the last item in the download list.

Pressing enter or space when the summary node is focused will open the downloads manager.

Currently only styled for gnomestripe. I'll have pinstripe and winstripe done soon.

Patch v2

Ok, I think this is ready for a review.
As suggested by mak in IRC, I investigated moving the summary in as a permanent-resident as the last item in the downloads list. That'd allow us to take advantage of richlistbox's keyboard event handling, and mean we didn't have to hand-roll it ourselves.

I just investigated it, and it looks like this introduces other hacks - we have to special-case the summary node in all of our key, click, and drag event bindings for the richlistbox.

So, in my opinion, I think our current approach is the less hack-y one (though they're both pretty hacky).
ok, thanks for investigating that possibility. I see we have many more handlers than I remembered and that may easily go out of control.

We should key down regardless DownloadsSummary, if it's not visible should be possible to key down to Show All History (that is the title of this bug).

So probably you want to check currentIndex externally, and inside distinguish the visible case.

This adds some complexity since you need a keypress handler on the button to handle key up. Alternatively we have to figure a way to unify the 2 bottom elements, or wrap them in a common box to handle that keypress (luckily the button already handles enter and space).

Oops - you're right. I was focusing entirely on the summary, and forgot to deal with the hidden-summary case.

I've wrapped the summary and the "show all downloads" button in a footer vbox, and added a DownloadsFooter singleton in downloads.js to handle events and manage focus.

considered the actual cases, I'd just go with a simple
if (aEvent.charCode == " ".charCodeAt(0) ||
    aEvent.keyCode == ||
    aEvent.keyCode ==)

we may add the switch in future if it will ever be needed

Switch is far too much for a single case, just add condition to the if.

nit: this doesn't hurt, though if I got correctly how parsing works, it's likely there's no win from using just "#downloadsPanel[hasdownloads] #downloadsHistory", cause there is only one #downloadsHistory that has only one parentNode (vbox), that again has only 1 parentNode (#downloadsPanel). It can't move from there.
I'd probably go for the short version everywhere unless there's a good reason to not do so.

nit: minor thing, please keep rules in the same order across different themes, the focus here is the first rule, while in gnomestripe and winstripe is the last one. This doesn't matter but when trying to keep themes in sync may help diffing.

Well, this is embarrassing. :/

Thanks for catching it!
