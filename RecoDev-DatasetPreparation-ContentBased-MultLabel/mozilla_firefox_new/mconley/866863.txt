Currently we are using extremely upscaled images for the menu panel's widgets, but we'll need some pretty icons before we can ship the new Australis menu.

Stephen, can you take point on this? Either upload the icons here or put together a patch?

Does this also cover changing Linux icons ?

WIP v1

This is the start, but it's missing icons for: Add-ons, Open File, Save(currently a blank page, but should it be a floppy disk?), Downloads, Home, Reload, Bookmarks, Stop, Full Screen

Here's a screenshot with the new icons, http://screencast.com/t/Dofh4n5RVOJ
*** Bug 868704 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
there is no 'save' button, and the current customize does not look pretty like that. the current customize does not look like any of the specs/fake drawings. are there builds I am missing (I am on UX), or did you Just Photoshop it. also, the customize menu does NOT center on lower resolutions, it just stays where it is. the buttons also do not look like that. yet the image looks real...

The patch here hasn't landed yet.
Steven says he's still working on 2 and busy with Metro workweek stuff, but might be able to get to it today.

Patch

I've left Linux out of this since we still haven't figured out what we're gonna do there (need a mix of some new icons, upscaled ones, etc).

Patch

Hey Jared,

The code looks fine - but when I drag any of those items (the "Find" widget, for example) to the nav-bar, I see the entire toolbar spritesheet - ex: http://i.imgur.com/7CPJlCR.png

I only tried Windows.

Patch v1.1

This patch includes a temporary hack to scale down the pretty icons if the widgets are placed in the toolbar. We'll need to get Toolbar.png updated to include the actual icons, but I don't want that to block this.

Patch v1.1

So I hate to make you do more here, but this kinda really busts things up on Linux because all of the icons are gone.

I know we're waiting on the spritesheet for Linux, so I think in the meantime, a dummy icon (as you suggested in IRC) would be good.

For OSX, I've noticed that the icons are scaled down when they're in the menu panel or the palette.  When in customization mode, if I "grab" an icon, it scales up and looks crisp.

Also for OSX - the bookmark icon is missing.

So, the code looks good, but I think we're going to want a few changes before landing.

Patch v1.2

I'm opting to not scale the large icons by 0.5 when in the toolbar. That seems to be causing some weirdness with all of the other toolbars (clicking on them causes them to "squish" down in their pressed state).

Leaving them big makes it more obvious what work there is left to do, whereas the "squish" effect doesn't really make it obvious what is causing the problem. So there's my justification.

Anyhow, we're gonna need those small icons at some point. I'll file a bug for that.

I've also gotten rid of the toolbar icon max-width and max-height that was calculated. That was forcing us to resize the icons and made them fuzzy on OSX. Gonna check out how this looks on Windows and Linux and then request review.

Patch v1.3

So I didn't want to create a bunch of temporary rules for Linux to deal with the fact that we don't have icons, so I just copied over OSX's icons as a stopgap. I can file a bug to replace the graphic.
Comment on attachment 752390
Patch v1.3

So, here's what I did:

1) I've eased up on some of the toolbarbutton icon rules so that we don't have fuzzy icons on OSX
2) I've copied over OSX's icons over to the Linux GTK theme as a stopgap until we can get icons there
3) For the icons on Linux that didn't originally have a spritesheet (like the cut and copy buttons), I've given those rules !important for now. They're going to get torn out when those individual buttons get removed, so this is just temporary.

engineManager.css still needs the preprocesser directive ("*") at the beginning of the line because the file includes %if 0 and %endif to comment out the license header.

Addressing jaws' comments.
Landed on UX as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/6eda5fb78959
With https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/95c1125909b9 to follow-up.
When moving some buttons to the nav-bar, they preserve the size supposed to be used in the panel instead of the 16x16 one. Here is the screenshot:

different icon and name for preferences

For consistency in the panel menu and in the homepage the icon should be the same for preferences and with the same name
