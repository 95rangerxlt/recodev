Note that this will pick up clicking the item in customize mode. Do we want that? Do we want to distinguish that from the other cases? If we're using that as the detail, do we care about which mouse button the user uses?

(r=me assuming this does what we want)
Blake:

Do you care about the case that Gijs has brought up - clicking of the menu panel button while in customize mode?
I don't think we need to distinguish it.  It's kind of interesting, but not interesting enough to do extra work to track at this point.  (And I strongly suspect the clicks that we are tracking will totally swamp the noise of the button being clicked in customize mode.)

I do reserve the right to re-visit this after Australis lands, if we hear a lot of reports of people trying to click buttons in customize mode.  ;)
Ok, thanks - then I'm gonna just go for it and land this puppy (which closes out the stuff that's blocking Australis). Thanks, you two!
