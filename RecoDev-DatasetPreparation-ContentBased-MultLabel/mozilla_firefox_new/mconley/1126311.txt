On Linux, we need OMTC in order for e10s to work. When browser.remote.tabs.autostart.1 is enabled, we force OMTC to be enabled.

Despite this, opening new e10s windows results in an alert dialog coming up saying that new e10s windows cannot be created because OMTC is disabled.

This alert makes some tests that open e10s windows (with OMTC force-enabled) fail on Linux, since the test gets blocked by the alert dialog and has to crash out.

We should be able to enable browser_crashedTabs.js, as well as the new test added for bug 1047603 once this gets fixed.
STR:

1) On a Linux machine with e10s enabled by default, open up the browser console (Ctrl-Shift-J)
2) Enter this into the console: OpenBrowserWindow({remote: true}); and press Enter

ER:

This should open up an e10s window without any difficulty, since we're already running with an e10s window.

AR:

We get a warning about OMTC being disabled, which is FALSE because OMTC has been force enabled by way of e10s being enabled by default.
