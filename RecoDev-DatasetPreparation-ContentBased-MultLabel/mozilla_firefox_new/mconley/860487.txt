We're firing the CustomizationEnd event before we're done unwrapping all of the toolbaritems. The downloads button does some fancy sleight-of-hand with the downloads button and placeholder, and it expects the items to no longer be wrapped.

I think this is consistent with how customization has always worked, so I figure we might as well just move the event to fire after unwrapping is done.
