We now have quite a few bookmark-related items in our customization palette. Bug 855805 is implementing the new bookmarks widget, and thus we shouldn't have multiple bookmark widgets within our customization palette. Having multiple will just lead to user confusion and make guiding users through our support harder.

The Bookmarks item that will be removed is the one that toggles the visibility of the Bookmarks sidebar. We will keep the Bookmarks item that allows the user to view their bookmarks in a panel/popup as well as convenient access to bookmarking the current page.

This bug is not concerned with removing the bookmarks sidebar.

is there an equivalent for the history button that opens the sidebar?
i suppose the same reasoning applies

Here's a first pass at this. Am I forgetting anything?

You forgot to remove the bookmarksButton.tooltip string and bookmarksButtonObserver.

mistake. please bring it back. it's a productivity thing and speeds up my work. sometimes I need to quickly click the sidebar on or off for a given wide page.
CTR add-on can add back the sidebar buttons, if you want to try it

A much simpler add-on could easily be created, just for the purpose of adding back the sidebar add-ons, I don't know if anyone made one yet.
