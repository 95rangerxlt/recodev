We're interested in collecting:

1) A boolean for whether or not the menubar is displayed by default
2) A count of how many times the menubar is used
3) A count of which default menuitems are being used

Small adjustment on the description for the sake of time - we still want 1 and 2, but not 3.
Note that I'm constraining this *just* to mouse clicks. This is not going to record keyboard access activity.

I'm assuming this thing (y u no context, splinter?) catches mouseups in the descendants of the menu, so that mousedown->dragdown-in-menu->mouseup still gets caught?

Why the distinction between menus and menuitems? Is that valuable? Or can we just log 'menu' ?

Yep, that should work.

UX is interested in whether or not people are actually opening things from the menu, as well as just looking at items in the menus. An increase in "menu" usage, but not in "menuitem" usage might indicate that users are looking for (and not finding) things. I thought that might be valuable.
