There should be a consistent space above the tabstrip regardless of PB, LWT, or sizemode. The space is currently lacking in PB mode when in fullscreen.

If bug 944228 is fixed, the test added there should be updated.

Add padding to PB windows in OSX native fullscreen mode

This is basically the same (well, a little different) as the bits from my patch in bug 939010 comment 9, except that it does introduce the same wrong padding normal and lwt windows have. That wrong padding is bug 878436.
Sorry for the delay, I'll get to this review tomorrow.
