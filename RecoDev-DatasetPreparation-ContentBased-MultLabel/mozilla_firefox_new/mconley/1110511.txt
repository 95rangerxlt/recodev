Our about:tabcrashed UX was spec'd out in bug 913651. We should actually implement that now.
The styling landed in bug 1087618. What still needs to be done here is the functionality part (new buttons, crash reporter, ...).
Bug 1112304 implements most of the new functionality. The only remaining work here is to add the small UI block from http://people.mozilla.org/~mmaslaney/e10s/Firefox-e10s-v6.png which lets you add a comment and your email address to the crash report.
Ursula, are you planning on continuing to work on this?
Yup! I actually start on contract next week so I plan to clear this bug then.

Some small drive-by nits for the CSS.

::: browser/themes/shared/aboutTabCrashed.css:15
(Diff revision 3)
> +  background-color: rgb(235,235,235);

This corresponds to var(--in-content-box-background-hover).

::: browser/themes/shared/aboutTabCrashed.css:18
(Diff revision 3)
> +  border: 1px solid rgb(193,193,193);

The color corresponds to var(--in-content-box-border-color)

::: browser/themes/shared/aboutTabCrashed.css:19
(Diff revision 3)
> +  border-radius: 3px;

I'm not seeing any 3px border-radius in the common.inc.css file, only some 2px ones, it'd be better to be consistent here.

::: browser/themes/shared/aboutTabCrashed.css:28
(Diff revision 3)
> +textarea {

Please fix common.inc.css rather than hardcoding styles here.
The styles are supposed to be defined here: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/shared/in-content/common.inc.css?from=common.inc.css#409 , but there was a typo while writing the code, html|textbox should have been html|input[type="text"] and html|textarea.
Ah, thanks ntim! Drive-by's welcome. :)

Ah, good point about not doing anything with the promise. I'll remove that.

The thing is, CrashSubmit.submit never returns anything false-y, so the if-block didn't seem to be doing anything. Unless I'm missing something?

Yes, that's my understanding having read the socorro source - specifically this test: https://github.com/mozilla/socorro/blob/9b6c1ad54648594865b410bb15e9a32e54949207/socorro/unittest/processor/test_mozilla_transform_rules.py#L39

Hey - I don't think I fully understand this one. Are you saying I should be overwriting all of those instances of textbox with input[type="text"]? And adding textarea too?

textbox is a XUL specific element. In the css, textbox is considered both as a XUL and HTML element which is incorrect. So basically, all html|textbox occurances need to be replaced with html|input[type="text"], html|textarea. The XUL occurance still needs to be kept for the xul consumers of the stylesheet. So the resulting code would be:

html|input[type="text"],
html|textarea,
xul|textbox {
  // default rules
}
html|input[type="text"]:focus,
html|textarea:focus,
xul|textbox[focused="true"] {
  ...
}

...and the same pattern applies for disabled.

While you're changing this, can you remove the hardcoded line-height, and change the height to a min-height like we currently do with buttons (dao originally suggested the change for buttons) ? These rules are not HDPI friendly.

I haven't checked how it looks, but please make sure the height is (approximately) 30px on 1x displays, simply for consistency with other in-content UI textboxes.

This comment of course doesn't apply to text areas, just single line text inputs.

this will probably generate a warning for a uncaught promise. It would be nice to do something in the UI to better handle this (maybe only remove the controls after success?), but for now let's at least add .then(null, Cu.reportError) here

Alright - I've altered the margins so that it matches the textboxes in the Preferences dialog.
