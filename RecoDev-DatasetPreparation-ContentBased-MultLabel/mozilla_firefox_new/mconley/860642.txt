The definitions for the built-in widgets in CustomizableUI.jsm is getting rather long - for the sake of sanity for anyone working on this, I think we should move the definitions to their own file.

There's a few options for doing that:
* Preprocess the new file into CustomizableUI.jsm
* Load the new file as a JSM
* Load the new file as a subscript
* Define in a .json (or .widget) file, load via the infrastructure originally setup for widgets registered via an add-ons chrome.manifest
