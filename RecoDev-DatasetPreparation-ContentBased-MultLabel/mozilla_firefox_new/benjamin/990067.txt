Builds for testing are now available at http://people.mozilla.org/~bsmedberg/plugin-whitelisting-91f6f3380041/

Please do a QA pass using a new Firefox profile to ensure that the plugin activates without a popup and appears as "Always Activate" in the addon manager. Report back in this bug when QA is complete. Please try to complete QA by the end of this week.
we have found that firefox whitelists the public and internal versions of the skype web plugin on the outlook.com domain on the mac, but not on windows:
public and internal versions of swp on outlook.com
==================================================
- mac osx 10.6 - 10.9 whitelisted
- win xp - 8.1 failed to whitelist; plugin is not detected, prompts to install plugin every time when user starts a call, appears as "Always Activate" in the add-on manager

furthermore, we've found that firefox does not whitelist any version of swp on internal test pages
public and internal versions of sap on internal test pages
==========================================================
- mac osx 10.6 - 10.9 failed to whitelist; plugin is not detected, appears as "Always Activate" in the add-on manager
- win xp - 8.1 idem
> - win xp - 8.1 failed to whitelist; plugin is not detected, prompts to install plugin every time when user starts a call, appears as "Always Activate" in the add-on manager

This indicates to me that the problem is likely on the website, not the client. Note that these builds include an unrelated change which prevents enumerating navigator.plugins. If your sites are currently detecting the presence of a plugin using navigator.plugins, you should instead use navigator.mimeTypes[myMimeType] to detect whether your plugin is installed. See bug 757726 and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorPlugins.plugins
Marco: if you are not able to change these websites to fix their plugin detection of the Skype Web plugin, please comment in bug 990808 or just email me. We can add the Skype Web plugin to our plugin detection whitelist (bug 990808), which is unrelated to the plugin click-to-play whitelist.
Fixed for Firefox 30 beta in bug 992995. I think we're good with QA but Marco can you confirm?
