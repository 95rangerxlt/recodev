Transition Plan:


Our long term plan 9-12 months plan is to move all the functionality of the plugin into a standalone application. We have standalone applications on some OS already available and we plan to do the same for all OS
Application accepted for this cycle. This debated whether to accept this: since this is not a plugin that provides general web functionality, a plugin is not the right technology. Expect that we will not renew this whitelist request when it comes up for renewal in 4 months.
This has landed in Nightly builds. Please download a nightly build from http://nightly.mozilla.org/. Using a fresh profile, verify that the plugin activates by default and shows as "Always Activate" in the Firefox addon manager.
