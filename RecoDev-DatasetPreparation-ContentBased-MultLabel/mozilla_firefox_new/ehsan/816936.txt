This sounds like a good idea, but we won't block shipping per-window private browsing on it.  However it would be very nice to have, indeed!

Steven, can you please give me an idea on how these dock menu items should be added?  Thanks!

I actually don't know much about manipulating the Dock, but a quick web search turned up the "Dock Tile Programming Guide" (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/customizing_docktile/intro/dockintro.html), which has a section called "Dynamically Adding Menu Items With the Application Delegate" (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/customizing_docktile/docktasks_cocoa/docktasks_cocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000986-CH3-SW1, scroll down to see it).  We're already doing this at [MacApplicationDelegate applicationDockMenu:] in toolkit/xre/MacApplicationDelegate.mm.

And we already have an nsIMacDockSupport interface, implemented in widget/cocoa/nsMacDockSupport.mm.

You're most welcome.  Good luck!

This should go through the OpenBrowserWindowFromDockMenu function instead. Add an options argument there.
