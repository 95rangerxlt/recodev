When using RTL version of Firefox, the feed selection is LTR instead of RTL. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Hebrew [Arabic? Farsi?] Firefox.
2. Click on the RSS icon on site that contain more than one feed per page.

looks like my bugzilla privileges are evaporating. this is the same on windows with beta4, but i can't change the OS here myself.
Thanks for the quick review, Tsahi.
Is this a dupe of bug 353087?

Probably not. That bug talk about the feed preview page, while this one is about the feed selector popup for sites with multiple feed choices. But I like the other bug.
tsahi_75@yahoo.com, I've adjusted your permissions so you should be able to edit bugs. 
Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).

Part of this bug (regarding the direction of the menu) is like bug 473440.  Another part is that the position of the menu is incorrect (like bug 427739).  The automated test tests the second part.
We need a Litmus test for the first part of this bug (the directionality of the menu itself).
Wouldn't this be better fixed by changing the meaning of "after_start" and "after_end" in the popup code when the chrome direction is RTL? It doesn't seem ideal to make these changes everywhere we open popups (bug 427739, this bug, etc.).
In bug 477754 comment 8, Neil mentioned that popup directions are handled correctly if the popup's frame is RTL.  I'm not sure why that doesn't work correctly in this case.  Neil, can you please clarify?
The location bar is ltr.

> The location bar is ltr.

Yes, but with this patch I set the direction of the menupopup element which is the child of feed-button to rtl explicitly.  I also tried setting the direction of feed-button to rtl as well, but in both cases the direction of the menu was incorrect.
Why is the location bar left-to-right, shouldn't it actually be the input inside it?
There is no general rule here, but it was decided that the site button should be kept next to the URL, which would be at the left side.  Given that, the star and feed icons would have to appear at the right side, and the only thing which was "mirrored" for RTL locales in the location bar was the drop-down arrow.
Mconnor: ping?

how about:

#feed-menu[chromedir="rtl"] > menuitem {
  direction: rtl;
}

See previous comment... seems like FeedHandler.adjustPosition can be avoided.
