Andres, can you guys prioritize this one please?  This test is currently failing on the Birch branch and I'd like to bring Birch to a green status.  Thanks!

Patch v1

This test is timing out on Birch: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=17326903&tree=Birch
The screenshot in the log shows that the third window is open and the search bar contains the "p". Presumably the history box isn't showing up for some reason.
I took a look at this and I cannot reproduce the issue locally. The only way I found that the history box is not shown, is when the 'public' search in the first window is not loaded, so there's nothing to show in the history and the history popup doesn't open. 
However, according to the log, the search is loaded: 
TEST-INFO | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/search/test/browser_private_search_perwindowpb.js | http://mochi.test:8888/browser/browser/components/search/test/test.html?test=public+test

Any ideas?
Strangely enough, I can't reproduce this locally either...

1. It could be a focus issue, since we don't actually make sure that the window is focused before invoking the popup.  I landed a patch to use waitForFocus, and we'll see if it fixes the orange: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/c63d5cff18ba

2. Looking more closely at the screenshot, the search box is not focused, which could mean that something in this event handler throws: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/search/test/browser_private_search_perwindowpb.js#88>.  To test that theory, you need to stick that code inside a try/catch block and log any possible exceptions that get thrown to see what's going on.  Unfortunately you need to test this on the try server as we don't seem to be able to reproduce the bug on our machines, but let's first wait and see if this fixes the orange on birch...
FWIW I just merged my patch to Birch...
(https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Birch&rev=2ede8a52700e)
FWIW, my patch does not seem to have helped.
I added a couple of info logs and a try/catch block just for testing and the try run is all green. See: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=4fa30a53a1cf 

I just ran it on linux, do you know if it was failing on a different OS or any other feature I'm missing?
Are you sure that try push actually used MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING?

> Are you sure that try push actually used MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING?

Good point, how I specify that flag on the try commit?
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/confvars.sh
To be more clear, you need to change this file like this: <https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/birch/rev/4ebb3a929502>.

Incidentally, this changeset is the only thing that the Birch branch has extra to mozilla-central.
Thank you both for clarifying! I'll run it again on try.
All green on Linux, with just the info logs.

OK, I *bet* that this is another manifestation of bug 817463.  What happens is that the home page loads, and steals the focus from the search bar, which can screw up this test.  My patch in that bug will probably fix this.
Hmm, actually the fix in bug 817463 won't affect this test since it lives in a different directory, but I can basically write the same patch for this test as well.

Yes yes yes.
With this patch, we might finally make Birch fully green tonight, except on Windows (bug 817447).  Yay! \o/

Spoke too soon... See bug 817487.  :(
