isn't the current private browsing ui (with the purple button) enough?
No, since the button isn't cross-platform.
ah
than maybe we could make the awesome bar light purple or display that little mask we use for private browsing in it between the url and the place where now the favicon still is?
some people might not like the changing of persona's, and adding a new complete theme seems to be a little bit overkill
The venetian mask could provide a clear indication (Chrome does it with the guy with the hat in the left corner).
Hmm, yeah, the idea of using the purple mask is good, I think, but I don't know where we would use it.  I don't personally like the way that Chrome incognito icon is positioned, but I will leave this to the UX folks to figure out.  :-)
well, maybe the mask could just go left of the url in the urlbar, or we could make the about:privatebrowsing an awesome bar-less apptab (like about:addons) so the favicon of it (the mask) indicates the private browsing session and leads to more information about private browsing
As info in the latest Chromium builds the color of the private browsing indicator (the incognito guy) has been changed to be less noticeable (grey instead of bright white).
Dao, one question here.  If we want to implement some of a theme darkening along the lines of http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/private-browsing-mode/mockups/australis-pbm.png (pre-Australis), can you please give me an idea how much work that's going to be?  Thanks!
You could probably apply a built-in dark persona, which wouldn't be a lot of work.

True, but that would mean bad performance.  Would it be possible for us to avoid using a persona?

> Hmm, will we need to build some machinery to apply per-window personas?

We already have that! <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#7088>  We can change the theme based on the :root[privatebrowsingmode=temporary] CSS selector.
The best way to implement this is the LightweightThemeConsumer constructor. The theme data could be serialized in a pref.

That is a great idea!  Thanks.
Just a thought that we might want to keep in mind how we will communicate to Windows 8 users when Firefox is or is not in PB mode. Ultimately we'd like some consistency of message visually between the desktop & Metro interface.

From what I gather glancing at bug 771188, Firefox for Metro is basically one window so it would be all or nothing when it comes to PB.
Dao, given the mock-ups that I received from shorlander in bug 729865, how much work would you estimate implementing the Windows 7 theme would be?  I'd like to know if it's going to be feasible in the short term in your opinion, and if it's not, figure out how to convince the shorlander to go with a Persona.  :-)

Screenshot comparing private & non-private windows.

Dunno if I should be posting this here or in bug 729865 ...

Using the above build I installed the dark persona I normally use (Gloss. Black). I then opened a new private browsing window. 
See accompanying attachment for comparison screenshot.
Can you tell the difference between the two? I can't.

I think we should revisit the discussion from earlier in this bug about using a consistent graphical indicator (I encourage you to read comments 0-7).
Whether you're aesthetically fond of the indicator in the upper left of Chrome's incognito window, you always know exactly which type of window you're using.
When you open a PB window, you sacrifice your theme customization for the PB functionality. I think people intuitively get this. I don't think we should hesitate to add an I-know-I'm-private-browsing graphic.

Tab-less windows (such as a "popped out" gmail compose window) suffer the the same problem I've illustrated even more acutely as it looks like it doesn't matter what platform you're on or what theme you're using, Private & non-private windows are indiscernible.

Placing a graphic in the location bar to the left of the URL icon would seem to solve the issue in all these situations.

I also feel compelled to point out that we allow users to remove *every* UI component (as well as the entire navigation toolbar itself) leaving just tabs.  The solution to this issue would seem to be doing what Chrome does which is to insert a global graphic in the upper left of everything.
Some comments about current private browsing UI : 
According to the Windows non-Australis mockup the URL bar and the search bar should be blackened. Do we still want this ?

The Firefox button should also show a mask next to "Firefox". It's a good indicator.

Australis tabstrip is also almost ready to land. Coordination is needed with Matthew N.
Comment on attachment 687567
Patch (v2)

The footer image is just one pixel wide and not repeated, so it's basically invisible. I think you can just drop it.

The header image seems unreasonably large. At the very least, you should convert it to a grayscale PNG. Is the dithering intended?

Does this mean we're not changing the overall look of the UI?
I think the dark persona plus a global graphic makes good sense.  The persona serves to differentiate the window types to users generally.  And the graphic takes care of the edge case of a default dark persona and chromeless windows.

I was asking, because there is no Windows mockup attached and in the last planning meeting notes (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Planning/2012-12-05) a link to mockups was given (http://shorlander.dropmark.com/94052) and it still include the stealth version of private browsing windows.

What seem to be the most recent mockups show an indicator that isn't very noticeable.

Long term I think we definitely need something comprehensive like the full UI stealth mode. However using a persona is not the right approach in its current state. Short-term we can use a per window indicator.

Regarding RTL, we correctly mirror the titlebar on Windows, so we should handle that here.  On Mac and Linux we don't do that, but on Mac the title is centered so we can put the icon on the left-hand side.  On Linux though, the title of the window remains on the left side so we can't really change anything.

So I got the icon to show up there properly but I still can't figure out what color I must use for the background.

There's no color difference, that's just the result of taking the screenshot off of a VNC window, apparently.  Here's a screenshot taken directly from the Ubuntu desktop.

This background color on <window> has more impact than we want here. For instance, the separator between the history side bar and the content are picks up that color.

Also, I don't really see how this solves the problem with both the menu bar and the Firefox button hidden on Ubuntu. The background image would be hidden behind the tab bar, right?

FWIW I tried them both, and it seems like the extension is broken on trunk (even when I modify install.rdf to manually allow 20.0.* as the max version).  At least, it doesn't manage to put the menu bar in the global Ubuntu menu bar.

Windows and Mac theme

Got rid of the Linux theme so that we can land this sooner.  I'll move the Linux theme to another bug.
Filed bug 827454 for the Linux theme part.

I don't really understand how this works on Windows. What hides privatebrowsing-dark.png when the Firefox button is visible?

That part of the patch was written by Josh.  Let me build on Windows and test it...

This is a front-end change for the theme for per-window PB on Windows and OS X.  We need it to ship per-window PB.  Should not be very risky.

Approving for uplift, given how close we are after the merge.

Titlebar and private theme changes look corrupted on private windows

I don't know if I should file another bug or put up my findings here; for maybe the past week, I noticed that the private browsing icon wasn't at the end like it was supposed to be, but near the center.

More recently, I noticed that the icon looks corrupted, and the titlebar would occasionally "mess up."

If it's important, I am running a retina MacBook Pro with a resolution of 1920 x 1200. What else can I do about this?

Stanley, thanks for reporting the problem. You're most likely seeing bug 831829 and bug 740923, so you probably don't need to file any new bugs right now.
Lawrence, what do we want to relnote here?
No action needed. I was just flagging the bug for the relnote about per-window private browsing for the relman team.

Yeah, that's my question.  Usually we relnote outstanding problems.  It's not clear to me what needs to be relnoted here.

We relnote notable new features, fixes, and outstanding problems. Here's an example

Oh I see, thanks!  In that case, I'd expect the relnote entry to mention "per-window private browsing", in which case perhaps the relnote bugzilla flag should be set on bug 463027 which is the main bug behind this feature, but as long as we're all on the same page, that doesn't matter a lot, I guess!
Yes, we are on the same page. :) IIRC, akeybl already had that bug flagged. I'll leave it to relman to set the flag on the bug that they prefer.
