about:robots

the about:robots page have not translated into Hebrew yet, but you can see in the attachment, it require some CSS fixes in order to make it usable (usable?! Are about:robots meant to be useful for something?!).

The image should be positioned in the right side of the page, and maybe even get it mirrored in order to make it face to the text.

Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).

Well, the current state of the page require some attention. If we live with the non-translated page we get it wrong with unnecessary RTL support (see attachment 313609). But we also get it wrong AFTER translating it. 

I'm attaching another screenshot of how it looks in Firefox 3.0rc2 on Hebrew locale.

What's wrong after translating it? I don't see what the problem is with attachment 324666.

The image should be floated to the other side. Please note the white line (hr) across the image.
Here's the culprit:

We would also need an RTL version of the image as well.

RTL version of the robot face (for check-in)

I simply made this by flipping the original image horizontally in GIMP.

cvs patch

Patch to respect the RTL mode in about:robots.

about:robots screenshot with this patch applied
Given that this has a relatively low-risk patch ready, and it matters to the RTL locales (when for example showing the friends how cool Firefox is in an RTL build), I propose we take this in 3.0.x (3.0.1 if possible).  I don't think, however, that it should block 3.0.1, although having it would be nice.
If it's just mirrored, I don't think the image needs ui-review. A hg patch would be nice, though.

Carrying over gavin's r+ from attachment 324765.  This can be checked in on the trunk together with attachment 324764.

cvs patch

It would be great if this can land for 1.9.0.2 on branch.  This is a fix for the about:robots page appearance for RTL locales which is pretty low-risk.

Wow, didn't know that!  :-)

Moving approval request out to 1.9.0.3 but I kind of think we shouldn't take this for 1.9.0.x and just pick up the fix in 1.9.1.
Doesn't really meet the "wanted" criteria (security, stability, regression from maintenance release). And likewise, doesn't meet the criteria for 1.9.0.4.
