After landing bug 248970, one test failed on tinderbox.  I made it a todo, with a comment referencing this bug.  We should understand what the failure is before we release beta 2 in my opinion, but I do not think it was enough to backout the whole feature.

The test in question is browser_248970_a.js in sessionstore.  So far it has failed on Linux and windows.  Still waiting on OS X

Patch (v1)

OK, so this is basically a timing issue.  If the test is executed quickly enough, then the timestamps will be the same after entering the private browsing mode, even though saveState *has* been called.  A delay as low as 50ms should be enough here, to ensure that the timestamps *will* be different if the file is written on entry, and also to make the test take as little time as possible.

(I'm sorry for how the patch is, couldn't make diff -w work; but anyway the code inside the timer has not changed -- I only removed Shawn's comment.)

I've backed this out due to the test failures on Linux
Simon: do you think we need a larger timeout here?  I really think that this is a timing issue, but I don't want to set a large timeout value to make tests slower than needed (see bug 463021).
If the writes are too quick in succession, we might have to use a different strategy: Just delete sessionstore.js and verify that it gets recreated (which should equal an updated lastModifiedDate but apparently doesn't).

This is a great idea.  Here's the patch which does this.  No more flaky timeouts!  :-)

Sure, just please be somewhat more specific with the variable names: What "path" and what "file"? r+=me with that fixed.

For checkin
I may not be around long enough tonight to check this in myself...
We decided to leave this till after Beta 2's freeze.

This is still causing some oranges.  Example: <http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1226216246.1226219612.30745.gz>

The nature of this failure is exactly like the previous one described in comment 6.  I'll attach a patch with the same fix as the previous patch landed for the failing test.

Third try

+  // set the interval to 0

This is pretty much obvious from the code. ;-)
If anything, you rather want to describe the desired effect(s) this has.

Fixed on check-in.
