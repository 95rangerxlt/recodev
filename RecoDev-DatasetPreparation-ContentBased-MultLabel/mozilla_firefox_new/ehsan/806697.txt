It may be be desirable to ensure that SSL page loads are unaffected by our PB session cleanup code that will run after bug 769288 lands.
The backstory of this code is bug 463256, where we added a terrible hack and wrote a test for the bug as described in bug 463256 comment 0.  This was a workaround to what was discovered to be bug 480619.  Then, over in bug 496335 we took out that hack but left the test in (mostly out of fear of the unknown!).  The bug in question came from the code which you took out in bug 769283.  So, now all traces of this problem are gone, especially after bug 769283 where the basic thing causing this was reworked.

We can definitely port some simulation of this test to the new APIs (by opening a PB window and closing it immediately), I guess.  But I don't see the point as it will be testing something else, entirely random.  Thus I question the value of existence of this test post per-window PB.  If you disagree, please let me know.

This sounds ok to me, in that case.
