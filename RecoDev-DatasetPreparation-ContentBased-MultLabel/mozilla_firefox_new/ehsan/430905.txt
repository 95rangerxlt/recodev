To appear more platform native and to give the application a slightly simpler appearance, sidebars (bookmarks, history) and toolbars (find) should use the file closeSidebar.png for the close button instead of the same icon used for closing tabs.

This change can apply to both both Luna and Aero, although currently closeSidebar-aero.png is identical to close-aero.png since aero already uses a simpler close button for tabs.

I don't remember the code notation you guys use, but since the new closeSidebar.png files have landed in the latest nightly, it is easy enough to get the sidebar to use the new file by adding 'list-style-image: url("chrome://global/skin/icons/closeSidebar.png");' to the "#sidebar-box .tabs-closebutton" entry in the browser.css file like so:


#sidebar-box .tabs-closebutton {
  list-style-image: url("chrome://global/skin/icons/closeSidebar.png");
  margin-bottom: 0px !important;
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px !important;
}

Trivial patch.

Should #textbox-input-closebutton in organizer.css (bookmarks organizer search box close button) also use this new button? What about messageCloseButton in notification.css (notification bar close message)?

It would also be nice to file bugs against other users of close.png (calendar, composer) to let them know of the new images available for sidebar-specific close buttons.

Trivial patch to use an icon which lands in bug 430759.
This should land after bug 430759.
#textbox-input-closebutton

This should be Search-close.png and Search-close-aero.png, filed bug 431002

Alex, do you have any thoughts about whether these should use the sidebar close buttons? It would be trivial to adjust the patch here to cover those as well, before landing.
I went ahead and landed this patch, can change the notification bar close buttons in a new bug if desired.

mozilla/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css 	1.209
mozilla/toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/findBar.css 	1.10 
We are going to need a new file for the notification bars if we use the gradients over in 423744, otherwise we should switch to closeSidebar.  I'll try to get that sorted out over in that bug momentarily.

Not sure what you mean. "#sidebar-box .tabs-closebutton" styles the sidebar close button.

sorry, I misunderstood it.
I thought it is for close button on each tab.
