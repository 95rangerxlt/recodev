He also mentioned on IRC that I should have used gPrefService, which is right.

mconnor, how would you like me to proceed here?  Do you want me to address all three items, or maybe some others as well?

Patch (v1)

Don't use the (function() {}() style and use gPrefService.  No other changes in this patch.  I don't think we should use the browser glue migration path because it's used for UI migration and it's absolutely needed before the UI appears, but this one is not, and I hate to add something to the browser startup cost when it's not needed there, as little as it may be.

Patch (v1)

Should also use let instead of var here, and Cu instead of Components.utils.
