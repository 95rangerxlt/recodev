STR:
1. Open FF using a new profile
2. Open 3 tabs and pin one of them
3. Restart Firefox and go to History->Restore Previous Session
4. Repeat step 3

Actual Results:
At step 4 History->Restpre Previous Session button is still enabled.

Expecred Results:
At step 4 History->Restpre Previous Session button must be disabled.

This is reproducible on all OS's starting with FF 21.0. I will provide the real causing changeset ASAP

This is an old regression that doesn't appear to be critical to our users (this is our first report). No need to track.

This looks like it won't disable the command across multiple windows...

Dao's review here should be enough.

Right, sorry. I totally missed that we need to handle all windows.

Disable 'Restore Last Session' menuitem after restoring  the last session, v2

Can SessionStore.jsm's restoreLastSession send a restoring-last-session notification? It's not clear to me why the _lastSessionState setter should notify. Seems somewhat obscure.
The problem is that external callers can reset the last session state by setting ss.canRestoreLastSession = false. When purging history we throw away the last session state as well.

I could copy the send notification code to all those places where _lastSessionState might be reset. I could also introduce a tiny object that holds the last session state and we could call something like LastSessionState.clear() in SessionStore internally, that might be more obvious than having a "private" getter/setter do it?

I guess so, especially since _lastSessionState is already a private property of the private SessionStoreInternal object, so _lastSessionStateInternal would add a third layer...

I wonder if this would be a better naming scheme:

let LastSession = {
  get canRestore()...
  getState: ...
  setState: ...
  clear: ...
}

Yup, I like that more. Thanks!
