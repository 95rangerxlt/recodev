Bug 430759 will land new icons to be used for "flexible space" in the toolbar customization palette on XP and Vista:

toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/toolbar/spring-aero.png
toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/toolbar/spring.png

if the tango theme would like to refresh this icon as well it should be placed in a similar location in gnomestripe.  A small amount of work is required for this update since the current file is a gif, and the new file a png.

spring.png/spring-aero.png haven't landed yet, and you'll need to also changes gnomestripe's toolbar.css to avoid breaking it.

Yes, they'll land in bug 430759, which is a dependency of this bug.  I'll request check-in on this bug after the icons land in bug 430759.

Let's just add the .png and keep the .gif in case there are existing toolkit users (probably unlikely, but doesn't really hurt at this point).

Looks like the addition of the png to this jar.mn already landed as part of the icon drop, so no need to make any changes to jar.mn.
Jakub, nice, btw can you round up the arrows a bit, so we don't end up with those too dark corners?
