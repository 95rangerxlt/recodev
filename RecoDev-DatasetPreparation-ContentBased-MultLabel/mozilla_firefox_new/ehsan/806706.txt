In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the same directory (perhaps with "_perwindowpb" appended to its file name), and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.  Note that the original test should only be added to the list of test files in Makefile.in ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING, and the new test file should be added to the list with the reverse condition.

WIP

This patch should do the job, but the PB portion of the test fails with:

18.74 TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL| chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/browser_save_link-perwindowpb.js | no cookie should be sent - Got cookie-present, expected cookie-not-present

This test was added in bug 792517.  Josh, could you please take a look to see why?  The correct private bit seems to be set on the channel.
It's failing because bug 722850 hasn't landed yet, so it's using the public cookie database.
Oh, right!
