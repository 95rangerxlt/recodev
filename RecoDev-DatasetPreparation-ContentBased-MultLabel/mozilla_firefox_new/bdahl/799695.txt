The pdf at http://www.5saisonssushi.com/inset.pdf isn't rendering correctly--as compared to my desktop pdf viewer, the background is much darker, to the point of making part of the foreground text unreadable.

The pdf at http://www.5saisonssushi.com/inset.pdf isn't rendering correctly--as compared to my desktop pdf viewer, the background is much darker, to the point of making part of the foreground text unreadable.
This causes documents with some backgrounds to be unreadable.

Reproducible on other platform, as well (tested wit Win Vista x86).
What I'm seeing in the latest Nightly under Windows 8:

> http://www.5saisonssushi.com/inset.pdf
Black "5 SAISON" covers some of the text.
No info-bar appears but I can manually download the PDF.
Adobe Reader does not render the black "5 SAISON" text.

> http://www.koryu.or.jp/nihongo/ez3_graphics.nsf/DBBDC3186266DE0049257791002967FD/$File/1-24.pdf?OpenElement
Black and white flower image renders making the text unreadable.
No info-bar appears but I can manually download the PDF.
Adobe Reader renders the flower image as light grey, making the text readable.

> http://www.numark.jp/products/ns6/data/ns6_product_overview_JP_web.pdf
Dark grey "NS6" renders on top of some of the text.
Info-bar appears allowing me to load the PDF in Adobe Reader.
Adobe Reader does not render the "NS6" text.

In my opinion, this is definitely a bug we should fix (if nothing else than to achieve parity with Reader) but I don't think fixing this should block shipping PDF.js in Firefox 19. One can work around this fairly easily by using another PDF viewer. However, I do think we should be offering the info-bar far more aggressively at launch.
Not a feature blocker, but we'll track for upcoming releases.

Console logs the message "Warning: TODO: Support non-isolated groups.", but the display was improved.
Sanitizer rejects fonts from some PDFs, but it is a separate problem.
Too late for speculative fixes on FF20 so this will remain unfixed for that release.
*** Bug 837554 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Fixed by bug 852981.
This patch was rather large and had follow up fixes that we'd also need to merge.  I would rather not uplift for FF21 and just let it ride trains and be fixed in FF22.
Marking this wontfix for Fx 21 , per comment 9.


Background too dark
