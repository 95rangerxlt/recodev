Steps to reproduce:

1)  Open web console
2)  Type "document.__proto__"
3)  Click the resulting object to inspect it.

EXPECTED RESULTS: Inspection window comes up

ACTUAL RESULTS: No inspection window, and error console has:

  Timestamp: 12/8/12 10:50:11 AM
  Error: TypeError: Value does not implement interface Node.
  Source File: chrome://global/content/devtools/dbg-server.js
  Line: 641
  Timestamp: 12/8/12 10:50:11 AM
  Error: TypeError: Value does not implement interface Node.
  Source File: chrome://global/content/devtools/dbg-server.js
  Line: 641

This is because the proto chain has getter properties that will throw when called on a non-instance object.

Patch coming up to fix this.

Make the console utils handle getters throwing by just reporting the property as having a getter, since the value can't be gotten.

Note that once bug 819624 lands this will be somewhat tested because there will be properties that throw on a chrome HTMLDocument (e.g. .domain).

Thank you for the patch! We should have a test as well. I can add one next week, if you're busy.
It's not so much being busy as having no idea how to add one.  So if you're willing to, that would be great!  Though note what I said in comment 1 about this being tested at least a bit by the existing tests once bug 819624 lands (which might admittedly not be too soon).

fix + test

Added a test which checks if inspection fails for document.__proto__. Please let me know if this is sufficient. Thanks!

Assuming the test fails without the patch, r=me
