The current strings reflect a time when there was 3 states (exact, fuzzed, no).  During recent discussions, we want to change this text such that it reflects the binary decision the user has (yes, or no).

patch v.3

>+geolocation.tellThem=Tell them
>+geolocation.tellThemKey=E

use lower-case e here, matching case is faster (looks for the first exact match, then inverts, AIUI)

>+geolocation.learnMore=Learn more.
>+geolocation.thisTime=This time
>+geolocation.always=Always
