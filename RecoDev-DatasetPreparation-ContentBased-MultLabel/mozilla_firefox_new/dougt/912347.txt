Every time a webapp re-registers a protocol handler that is already registered, there is an info bar that displays:

%S has already been added as an application for %S links.

I am not sure why we do this, but it is pretty annoying.  Re-registering should be silent.

myk, do you mind if I remove this?
I don't mind!  And I agree.  This message is particularly confusing because it appears *before* the user is prompted to approve the registration; so it can easily come out of the blue, with no context to explain why it appeared:

  https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/blob/f194714a1daafa4fe4ba0a211cf63e9e21f319e9/browser/components/feeds/src/WebContentConverter.js#L412-L416

And nothing in the spec requires or even suggests such a message:

  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#custom-handlers

However, I'm neither the owner nor a peer of the module in question (Firefox).  Let's see what Gavin thinks.
no objection!
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=372441#c10 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=372441#c13 don't have any rationale, unfortunately)

I should remove this.

Remove the |var buttons = [addButton];| below and just change this to be:
var buttons = [{
 ...
}];
since addButton isn't used elsewhere.
