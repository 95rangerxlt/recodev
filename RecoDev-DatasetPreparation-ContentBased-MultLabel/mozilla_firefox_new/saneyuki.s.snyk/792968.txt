Instead of /^foo/.test(string), we can write string.startsWith("foo"). The latter is faster.

Here's a list of candidates:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=%2F^&find=%2Fbrowser%2F[bc]&filter=/\.test\%28

Not all regular expressions in that list can be replaced, only the most simple ones.

It looks like the MXR has started choking on that search. Luckily I still had the results page cached. Here's the list.
I can do this.. this should be on "mozilla-central" (currently I have "integerations/fx-team")?
fx-team will work just as well.
I am using mozilla-central finally, I have done the changes how I can test them? that I don't break any functionality?

Forgot to remove the old if statements in two files.

>-    if (/^https?/.test(feedURI.scheme))
>+    if(feedURI.scheme.startsWith("http") || feedURI.scheme.startsWith("https"))

This conversion (which is formally correct) shows that the original code actually didn't make sense. When the scheme is https, the first condition (starts with "http") is already satisfied. So we could (1) drop the second condition (starts with "https"), or we could (2) convert the whole thing to:

if (feedURI.scheme == "http" || feedURI.scheme == "https")

or we could (3) change the regular expression to test the scheme from the beginning to the end:

if (/^https?$/.test(feedURI.scheme))

I'm leaning towards the third option, as it's the briefest, stricter than the first option, and since the code paths where we test this don't seem to be performance-critical.


browser/base/content/browser-places.js:

>-        if (/^https?:/.test(iconURL))
>+        if(iconURL.startsWith("http:") || iconURL.startsWith("https:"))

browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js:

>-  if (!(/^https?:/.test(url)) || imagePref == 2)
>+  if(!url.startsWith("http:") || !url.startsWith("https:") || imagePref == 2)

browser/components/sessionstore/content/aboutSessionRestore.js:

>-      if (/^https?:/.test(iconURL))
>+      if (iconURL.startsWith("https") || iconURL.startsWith("http"))

browser/components/tabview/favicons.js:

>-    if (/^https?:/.test(tabImage)) {
>+    if(tabImage.startsWith("https:") || tabImage.startsWith("http:")) {

I think we should just keep the regular expression tests in these cases.


browser/components/places/content/controller.js:

>       if (ip.isTag && ip.orientation == Ci.nsITreeView.DROP_ON &&
>           dragged.type != PlacesUtils.TYPE_X_MOZ_URL &&
>           (dragged.type != PlacesUtils.TYPE_X_MOZ_PLACE ||
>-           /^place:/.test(dragged.uri)))
>+            dragged.uri.startsWith("place:"))

nit: the new line is indented too far

general style nit: there should be a space between "if" and "("

I can make these changes before checking this in.

Thanks!

You erroneously removed a closing round parenthesis.

bug 797430 has been caused by replacing the valid /regex/.test(undefined) case. I quickly skimmed the patch here and other cases look fine (the values look always defined), though better remember this case for future reference.
