Not showing the full-screen icon in PDF viewer.
It should be shown next to the "Download" icon.

Some people might want to enable it for testing, or something. Doesn't really hurt to take it for consistency, IMO, since there's no risk.

We normally don't take fixes for features that are disabled by default, and enabled through about:config. Tinkerers can always get their fix on Nightly. It's mostly a matter of consistency in triage and landings.

Understood that a file addition is obviously low risk though.
