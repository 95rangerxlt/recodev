JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js, line 474: nsICacheEntryOpenCallback is not defined

I don't have a reliable way to reproduce, but looking at the JS, I don't see where that identifier is ever declared.

JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js, line 474: nsICacheEntryOpenCallback is not defined

I don't have a reliable way to reproduce, but looking at the JS, I don't see where that identifier is ever declared.
Two files have this line:

browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js
browser/components/places/tests/unit/test_clearHistory_shutdown.js
Definitely just needs _Ci._nsICacheEntryOpenCallback;  Easy to fix.  The onCacheEntryCheck is called when the entry to examine is in the cache.  If not, that callback is not invoked.

browser/components/places/tests/unit/test_clearHistory_shutdown.js has the same bug.

test_clearHistory_shutdown.js is "fixed" in this patch... But nsICacheEntryOpenCallback.ENTRY_VALID doesn't seem to exist?

Oops, yes, I only saw the first chunk and assumed there was nothing else, according to the bug summary.

True.

Approving to avoid the regression, given how trivial the change is and since its super low risk.
