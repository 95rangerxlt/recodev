Just for the record: We are in the final steps of getting our 1.0 release together which will support Fx3 (or at least the betas for now).
There is beta2 and our nightly builds that show the current progress (available from http://code.downthemall.net/)

bug #371508 is still an issue.

Nils, great to hear Fx3 compatibility is on the way! is bug 371508 blocking you?

Kind of. Either it get fixed or it is time for another round of ugly work-arounds.  :p
We hit it at the moment in two occasions:
 * Our Download Info dialog.
 * Our overlay of unknowncontenttype.xul (aka. SaveAs window). This one may resolve itself when/if the new UI hits.

OK -- I've ping'd the bug -- hopefully we will find out if it is planning on being fixed for Fx3...


Status update:
DownThemAll! 1.0 out for 2.0.0.8 - 3.0b3.
We'll release updates as required.

Will close this bug once FX3 is out and dTa is officially supported for it.
Great, have you uploaded the new version to addons?

Yep. It's already public there. The privileges of being "trusted" ;)
