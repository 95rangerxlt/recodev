The index contains some dead links. A couple of links are missing on folders.
Some existing links should be changed. Some entries should be removed. The "#i"
section is duplicated. Clean up the "Download Manager" entries. Correct a couple
of typos (e.g. always lowercase "defined").

It is indeed big, and I don't have the time to fully, fully test this.	I'll
assume you have.  A few comments, though, and then after that just check it in.

Please capitalize main words similar to how we do it for headings and titles in
the Help docs.	"Popups", "Back", and "Forward" are all important enought that
they should be capitalized.  ("defined" isn't, so keeping it lowercase
throughout is good.)

IDs with spaces are technically illegal, I think.  Convert it to the
"word-word-word" format and you're good to go.
Checked in br & trunk, with nits fixed, especially all the Popups uppercased.
