I don't have a working Windows build environment because I wiped my hard drive
to install FC4 and MS's newest SDK breaks free VC++ builds without tree hacks I
haven't had time to make.  That said, it looks like there's a hanging <br/> on
Windows.

Ditto the previous comment here.  Also, I think on Mac you'll get Cmd+] jammed
together with Cmd+Right Arrow with no <br/> between the two.

I'm falling asleep here, tho, so tell me if I'm not reading this correctly. 
Also, keep in mind the order in which these are displayed is mostly irrelevant,
so if it works better to change the display order, by all means do so.

split up this mess

This is ridiculous. Every time we have a change here, we have to completely
rearrange this, run through it several times, and test it on all platforms just
to make sure there's no mistake. Let's split up this mess.

Change the formatting in both places like so to make it more readable:

>+        <span class="win">
>+          &altKey;+<kbd>Left Arrow</kbd><br/>
>+          <kbd>Backspace</kbd>
>+        </span>
>+        <span class="unix">
>+          &altKey;+<kbd>Left Arrow</kbd><br/>
>+          <kbd>Backspace</kbd><br/>
>+          &accelKey;+<kbd>[</kbd>
>+        </span>
>+        <span class="mac">
>+          &accelKey;+<kbd>[</kbd><br/>
>+          &accelKey;+<kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
>+        </span>

...and r=me.
