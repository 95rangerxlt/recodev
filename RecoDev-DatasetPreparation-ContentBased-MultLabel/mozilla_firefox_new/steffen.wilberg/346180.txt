Continued from bug 328563:

- Make the word "version" localizable.
- Solve the problem that the links in this sentence can't be swapped:
"Copyright © 1998-2006 by contributors to the Mozilla Project."
I suggest to remove the second link ("Mozilla Project" currently links to http://www.mozilla.org/about/).
