patch

The important part, relevant to l10n:
- changes &accelKey; (Cmd) to &ctrlKey; (Ctrl)
- adds the right-click equivalent in a few places
- fixes a few errors like "press Cmd on on the link or image"

The rather unimportant and not l10n-affecting part:
- harmonizes the wording by changing "Cmd+click", "click the mouse button" etc.
 to "press Ctrl, click on ... and ..."
patch looks good to me.
