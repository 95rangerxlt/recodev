The documentation doesn't say how to remove (not hide!) a custom toolbar. In my
testing, this can be done by simply removing all items from the toolbar.

Filing this because at least one person got confused about it:

I moved the section on how to add custom toolbars down, because that's a somewhat useless feature, whereas rearranging toolbar items is much more common. I also shortened that a bit. Of course I also documented how to get rid of custom toolbars.
Did you miss a comma in "Hiding, Adding*,* and Removing Toolbars"?
I guess so. I tend to forget it because it's wrong in German.

I've wanted to do this or something like it for a long time; the titles here have a completely different style from everything else in docs.

I don't think the second sentence is needed, and it's vague anyway.

This shouldn't be shown on Macs.  Adding |class="noMac"| should work just fine.  (I tested to make sure |display: none;| works on list items, and it does.)

>+  wish to keep them on your screen. You cannot hide the Menu Bar because you

This last sentence should be inside a <span class="noMac"/>.

>+  click Done. You can also hide a custom toolbar, see the previous paragraph.</p>

s/, see/ as described in/

Other than that, it all looks good to me.  Sorry for the delay in review, but it came just as I was starting finals, and I've had a lot on my plate since then.

Adresses the review comments. Good catch about the menu bar on Mac; I've hidden another sentence regarding menu items on Macs. I've also changed "Location bar" to "Location Bar" like it's used everywhere else.

No problem, we're not in a hurry. I can very well understand that since my time is limited as well.
