patch

Replaced the "When a web site requires a certificate" and "Verification" paragraphs. The former was completely bogus; I learned from bug 395399 that that's really about personal certificates. A few (very few) sites use that instead of username/password to identify their users. That has nothing to do with secure (https) sites in general.

Nit: move the href= to the second line.

This is slightly incorrect; the following should be more correct:

  In order to do so, they ask &brandShortName; to generate one for you.

The cert is generated client-side, and then Firefox sends the corresponding public key (the cert's the private key) to the server, but I don't think we really need that level of detail.  Just saying the site tells Firefox to generate the cert is accurate and informative enough here.

Ugh, we had a grammar problem here?  I wonder how long that's been there; I bet it's pre-1.0.  :-\

"OCSP server against which to validate all certificates"


As it happens, MIT's infrastructure is one of those few sites that relies on certificates; I claim inexperience with the system causing the errors when I (?) originally wrote or reviewed this.  ;-)

Done.

No, the certificate is the public key: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate.
But you're right, I've seen that little dialog displaying "generating a private key". However, that's not always the case: My email provider let me choose a password and then export my certificate to disk, from where I could import it into Firefox and Thunderbird. So they generated both the public and the private key.
But I guess the more common case is the client-side key generation; the provider really shouldn't know my private key...

Because of bug 398203 comment 4, I also changed the previous sentence to:
"Some servers ask you to identify yourself with a personal certificate."
("servers" instead of "web sites" and "ask" instead of "requires")

> >-      &brandShortName; verify the validity of your certificates using OCSP

No, that sentence has been rewritten in bug 341899 for 2.0...

Done.
Checked in.

I noticed this line hasn’t changed in the Help doc yet. Wouldn’t it need to?

That's another bug. But we're switching to online help anyway, and that has already been updated:
