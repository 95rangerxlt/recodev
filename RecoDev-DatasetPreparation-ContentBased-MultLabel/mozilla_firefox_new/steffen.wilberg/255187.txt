This is a typical front-end accessibility bug. We're going to have a lot of
these as we start to look at Firefox accessibility issues.
Steffen, this is probably yours.

Aaron: so we should basically do _content.focus() on closing the sidebar?

No, I didn't touch this in bug 188910. But this works fine.

This works fine, but can you look at making a more general fix? For example, if
focus is on something that gets hidden, destroyed or disabled, focus should
automatically move to the next focusable item. If that's too much work or
beyond what you're willing to get into, we should file a bug to do that and
check in this temporary fix. We can remove the code when the more general fix
goes in later.

This isn't yours, but I noticed an extra semicolon:  
elt.setAttribute("checked", "true");;

yeah, it'd be better to have a global fix, but lets spin off a separate bug for
that, since its probably a more comprehensive fix and this isn't a good time
for that type of fix.

I have no idea about fixing the general problem.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
