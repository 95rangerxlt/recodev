This is pretty much done, but I want to read through it again before I request
review.
Created attachment 188248
patch v1.0

I guess this is not perfect yet, but it should be good enough for review
purposes.

I got rid of the "Cookie Manager" terminology. There is no such manager.
There's an exceptions window and a view cookies window.

The Allow for Session functionality was largely missing.

I removed all screenshots but the "ask dialog" one, since you can't open this
dialog as easily as the exceptions and view cookies windows.

Remove the middle sentence, and expand the first sentence with, ", including
cookies which would allow a site to recognize you effectively forever."

>+  <li>Click the <em>Privacy</em> panel and then click on the <em>Cookies</em>

Insert a comma after "panel" here, please.

Move "From [...] box" to the end and readjust punctuation/capitalization
accordingly.  This ordering feels a little more natural to me.

>+<p>If you want to grant sites you trust the ability to store cookies permanently,
>+  which is useful for sites you want to e.g. logged in automatically,

Change ", which is useful for sites you want to e.g. logged in automatically"
to " (e.g., to allow you to log in automatically to a site)".  Also, add "
address" after "enter the site", please.

>+    cookies are disabled. If you want to grant certain sites the ability to

Once again, add " address" after "enter the site".

>   <ul>
>     <li><strong>until they expire</strong>: If this &pref.singular; is selected,
>+      cookies will be removed when they hits their expiration date.</li>

All cookies don't have the same expiration date, so this can be interpreted to
be misleading.	How about:

If this &pref.singular; is selected, each cookie will be removed when it
reaches its expiration date.

>+  <dd>If you don't want this cookie to be stored, click <em>Deny</em>. Use this
>+    if you don't trust the site or suspect that it's compromising your privacy.</dd>

>+    &brandShortName; to remember your decision and not ask again. The site will
>+    be added to the <a href="#cookies_exceptions">Cookie Exceptions Window</a>,
>+    where you can revert your choice.</dd>

Rhetorically, why would the user want to revert his choice?  Maybe adding
"should you wish to do so later" at the end would solve the problem.

>+<p>Access this window by clicking the <em>Exceptions</em> button in cookies
>+  &pref.plural;. Here you can make exceptions from your general cookies

Your example uses are too long.  How about this sentence instead of "For
example [...] kept permanently.":

Using exceptions, you can allow all cookies, reject all cookies, or allow
cookies which will be kept until you exit &brandShortName;, regardless of your
other cookie settings.

I don't really, really like this suggestion, but I think it's at least
marginally better.

>+  cookies from the site, click <em>Allow</em> to allow cookies from the site,
>+  or click <em>Allow for Session</em> to allow cookies from the site, but have
>+  them deleted when you exit &brandShortName;.</p>

I'm pretty sure you don't need the comma after "to allow cookies from the
site".

>+<p>To remove a site from this list, select it and click <em>Remove Site</em>. To
>+  clear the list completely, click <em>Remove All Sites</em>. This will clear
>+  the exceptions list, so your general cookies &pref.plural; apply.</p>

I don't think you need the comma after "exceptions list", either.

Anyway, assuming these changes meet with your approval, r=me.
I'm following all comments, except this one:
Instead of "Using exceptions, you can allow all cookies, reject all cookies, or
allow cookies which will be kept until you exit &brandShortName;...".
This sounds like Firefox only accepts session cookies, which would be wrong.
It doesn't matter if the site wants to store a permanent cookie or a session
cookie. If you specify "Allow for Session", Firefox accepts all cookies, but
degrades them to session cookies, so they will be deleted when you exit Firefox
even if the site wanted to store a permanent cookie.
I suggest "Using exceptions, you can allow all cookies, reject all cookies, or
allow all cookies but have them deleted when you exit &brandShortName;...".

I also fixed the toc entry from "Other Settings" to "Cookie Settings", because
I've renamed it in the document from "Other Settings" to "All the Settings".

Assuming r=jeff still holds.

A few things which are fixable on checkin:

> <p><img src="&images.baseURL;/cookie_accept.png"
>   alt="" width="286" height="87"/></p>

You forgot to remove this.

>+    be added to the <a href="#cookies_exceptions">Cookie Exceptions Window</a>,
>+    where you can revert your choice, should you wish to do so later.</dd>

You don't need to insert the comma after "choice".

>+  &brandShortName;, regardless of your other cookie settings. In the Status
>+  column, you can see if a site is blocked, allowed, or allowed for session.</p>

I should have noticed the first time through, but the site's not what's being
blocked/allowed/session-allowed -- it's the site's cookies.  Can you change
"site is" to "site's cookies are" to fix this?	Also, "allowed for session"
isn't as understandable as "allowed but deleted when you exit &brandShortName;"
(in the style of other references to session-only cookie behavior, although I'm
uncertain whether the phrasing's possibly too terse), so please change that
too.

In any case tho, the r+ does indeed still hold.

I left that in intentionally, see comment 2. But on second thought I guess this
can be removed as well along with the other screenshots in this document.

Sure.

That sentence doesn't need to repeat the options (Allow/Allow for Session/Block)
. All it adds to the sentence before is that the status will be displayed in the
status column. So how about this:
"In the Status column, you can see how a site's cookies will be treated."

Of course we could remove that sentence completely.
(In reply to comment #9)

Oops, didn't notice that.

Since I was just requesting what I thought you were intending to do, feel free
to ignore me if you want.  :-)  Of course, if you really think it should be
removed then by all means go ahead with it.

> Of course we could remove that sentence completely.

That's actually probably best.  We go on to explain things better later, so
there isn't much of a reason to keep it.
Checked in, with both the screenshot and that sentence removed. Most users won't
ever see the Cookie Accept dialog, and it's not that hard to understand the doc
without a screenshot.

remove screenshots from cookies.xhtml, recommend "until I close Firefox" and do some cleanup
