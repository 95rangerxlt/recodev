This change (to using the prefs entity) is actually incorrect, as it seems the
text isn't OS-specific.  The only difference is that the message has three
periods at the end of it.  I filed bug 293523 and provided the patch to get the
platform-specific string issue fixed, but for now we should just add three
periods to the end of the string and otherwise leave it alone.

>+  <li>Don't show this message (the information bar) when blocking popups</li>

Change "(the information bar)" to "(info message)", as at least in Linux that's
what I'm seeing as the result of hitting the status bar button.  Also, change
"blocking popups" to "when popups are blocked".

These are trivial changes, so just make sure to fix them before you check in
the patch.  Requesting approval for checkin...
