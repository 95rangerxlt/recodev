I want to see "Help" buttons in a couple of dialogs, most important in Options.

The backend is already (still rather) in place, see
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/help-viewer/content_packs.html#launching_help_viewer

I removed the Help button in the password manager in bug 217147 (among other
things). It doesn't even have l10n imact as far as I can see.

patch for the main Options dialog

Adding a Help button is not that hard :)
Getting it to work in the Options panel is a bit trickier since the button is
in pref.xul, but it has to open Help sections depending on the content shown in
an iframe in the right half of the dialog. So I'm adding the helpTopic to the
respective file and query that from nsPrefWindow.js.

R.J., comments? I guess you're somewhat more familiar with context-sensitive
Help!?
Sounds good to me. Usually I'd say this would be bad if help was to be not
built, but currently its not possible without hacking the makefiles. Definetely
a different issue than what arises with seamonkey. So I say sure IMO. As always,
I'd ask ben (and only ben) for review/approval. Sounds like a decision he should
make.

Not me :). I'd just say ben instead of a email address. Those things change often.
I meant: I guess that's you, Ben Goodger? Do you want me to change
ben@netscape.com to bugs@bengoodger.com?
Ben is the guy I requested review from at the same time you know :)

More Help buttons.
not a blocker, but nice-to-have.
With the UI freeze at the beginning of October and the rejection of a few other
minor issues with the Help viewer UI, this won't make 1.0.  Retargeting...

patch for the new world, v1

This patch adds Help buttons to all prefpanes of the prefwindow, as well as all
of its child prefwindows and dialogs: conncection settings, sanitize settings,
fonts, colors, change actions, languages.
It does not include the <window>s, because we need to decide whether and where
to add the button manually: allowed sites/exceptions, cookies, download
actions.
It also does not include the password manager and the set/change/remove master
password prefwindows, and the dialogs in the Advanced-Security-Certificates
section, because we have no useful documentation for that.

If the prefpane has tabs, the Help button is specific to that, so if you click
Help when the passwords tab of the privacy pane is displayed, the Help Viewer
displays the section on passwords.

The most difficult part was to get the Help button to appear. In dialogs, you
just specify buttons="accept,cancel,help". This doesn't work in prefwindows.
But since I wanted to make the Help button specific to the selected tab, I
needed a special implementation anyway.

The "makeHelpButton" method un-hides the Help button if the current prefpane
has a helpURI attribute. That method is called at the end of the "showPane"
method. The problem is that the prefpane may not be finished with loading,
especially when clicking the pane the first time after a restart of Firefox.
So I used a timeout to call makeHelpButton. It needs to be quite a long one, at
least on my Linux/GTK2 build, which is pretty slow in displaying the
Preferences dialog. Maybe this can be improved by using an onload handler.

The "dialogHelp" handler calls openHelp(helpTopic, helpURI) in contextHelp.js.
The helpTopic can be set as an attribute of prefpanes, or tabs.
Moving this into the correct product/component, sorry for bugspam in advance...

err, we do want the help button on mac,  you need to fix preferences.xml to
only hide the relevant buttons (instead of their parwent)

Also, why is it setTimeoted? If it is a "dom isn't ready" case, "0" should be
fine.

As you're using openHelp() in the binding, it has to provide this method
(that's instead of including an external script in every pane).

So there should be a Help button on Mac, but no Close (or Cancel/Accept)
buttons, right?

"0" doesn't work. The Help button would stay hidden the first time you display a
prefpane after a restart of Firefox. But I've found a better solution. There's
already a "OverlayLoadObserver", which is called in the showPane method if the
prefpane hasn't been loaded before. _selectPane is called either from that or
directly in showPane. So I can move the logic into _selectPane and don't need a
timeout.

This patch fixes the Help button on Mac, and gets rid of the setTimeout.
Well, ths still doesn't address the openHelp issue.

include the contextHelp.js stuff into preferences.xml

I'm not completely convinced that we need to do this, so I made a separate
patch for this.

IMO, its better to have these as methods/properties of the binding, instead of
external dependencies

please fix the atrocious styling here to fit toolkit and not the
should-be-beaten-with-a-stick "style" that Help code used.  also,
s/windowManagerInterface/wm/ for compactness/readability/style.

you can refactor this in a much more straightforward/compact way, trying the
panel first only makes sense if it takes priority:

// if there's tabs, use the tab's helpTopic if set
var box = this.getElementsByTagName("tabbox");
if (box[0]) {
  var tab = box[0].selectedTab;
  if (tab && tab.hasAttribute("helpTopic");
    return tab.getAttribute("helpTopic");
}

return this.getAttribute("helpTopic");

r=me with comments addressed

I'm sure that the positioning of the solitary Help button in the main
prefwindow is going to be wrong, but that can be done as a followup by someone
more Mac-focused *cough*
