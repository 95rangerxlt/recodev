In firebird-toc.rdf there's a reference to accessibility.xhtml#using_a_high_contrast_theme (ID="a11y-high-contrast", line 210) that should not be displayed on a Mac (that part of the page is included in a div with class "noMac").

There's another reference to File->Quit that is wrong (line 268, ID="menu-exit-nowin"): it's nc:platform="unix mac" but should be "nc:platform="unix"

patch
*** Bug 353332 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This bug may also appear in other non-en-US locales. I filed bug 353335 for Polish, but it'd be nice if someone checked if others are affected.
Fixed on trunk.
Axel, can we get a late l10n impact here?
Mike, as you can see in bugs 353335, 353370 and 353404, two locales have already ported this patch and checked it in for rc1 (pl, ru), the other (fr) awaits checkin for a (IMHO imminent) rc2. If we do have an rc2, I'm sure most of the others will follow, given a few days time.

On the other hand, one could make a patch fixing all of the locales (except pl and ru), as this is only a change in RDF parameters and not actually in the real localized content.


I'm with Marek here, please create an accompanying patch for l10n, I can check that in to ride along with this one.

patch for 47 locales

OK, this is my search-and-replace job across all toc files. I hope I didn't mess up the character encoding, but it looks reasonable in UTF-8.

patch for 47 locales

Looks good to me, poke me if/when you need a landing buddy.

This should be part of the posting to .l10n that bug 353533 wants, too.
I just checked in the patch for 47 locales on the 1.8 branch. So the only locale left to fix is en-US.

patch

Approved for RC2 (help only).
Fixed on branch.
Verified fixed on the 1.8.1 branch by code inspection for the en-US locale, the af locale and the es-ES locale.

The patch for 47 locales doesn't seem to have been checked in on trunk, shouldn't it be checked in also there?
The patch didn't apply cleanly on trunk, so I left that to the localizers. They just need to copy their files from branch to trunk and check them in.
That's what I said on .l10n as well:
