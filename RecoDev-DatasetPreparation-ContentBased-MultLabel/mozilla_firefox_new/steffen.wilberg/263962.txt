See bug 263246 comment 1 for a description.  I don't know how much we'll get to
for 1.0 (and thus it isn't late-l10n or blocking bug 253104 yet), but I'm not
sure what sort of demands we can put on localizers for 1.0mac.  In any case this
should definitely be done for then.

The "Firefox menu" mentioned in bug 263246 comment 1 is the same for every Mac
app AFAIK. I don't think we need to document that. Neither "Minimize" etc.

We don't need to document "Hide All", "Show All", but we do need to document
"Quit", "Minimize", "Zoom" and "Preferences"
From the dupe:
Quit is in the Firefox menu, not in the File menu.
Preferences in the Firefox menu, not in the Tools menu.
(We've already changed the Mac menu path in bug 265741.)

Is the list from bug 263246 comment 1 correct:
Firefox menu
------------
About Mozilla Firefox
Preferences...
Services (not yet implemented?)
Hide Firefox
Hide Others
Show All
Quit Firefox

Window menu
-----------
Mimimize (not working)
Zoom (aka, maximize --also not working)
Bring All to Front (also not working)
[list of Firefox windows, by <title>]

In  Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.3)
Gecko/20041030 Firefox/1.0RC2 help docs., it's still listed in "Tools"

Only those should be documented.

both working in latest builds.

> Bring All to Front (also not working)

Yep, we shoudn't document this one.

That's both false and true. The menu reference still lists Preferences in Tools.
Bug 265741 changed the menu path. That describes the way to open the Preferences
dialog, e.g. in the menu reference->Go->Home, it should say "select Firefox > 
Preferences and open the General panel".
-> me. We need to fix this ASAP as 1.0Mac is likely to be released on Nov 9 as
well: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/roadmap.html
Where is the Window menu located?
(In reply to comment #8)
> Where is the Window menu located?

between Tools to Help
Almost done.
What does Minimize do? Minimize the current window? Or minimize all Firefox
windows including Extensions, Download Manager etc.? I'm on #documentation btw.

current window is minimized ;-)
additional comment:
However, the Window menu does not work correctly like bug262201,etc. except Camino.

Adds Firefox and Windows menus. In the document, I've put it inside <div
class="mac>. It makes no sense to show this on other platforms. In the toc,
I've added "(Mac only)". I've merely copied the descriptions for the Firefox
menu items from their original locations.

And I've removed File->Quit, Tools->Preferences, and Help->For IE users on Mac.
The latter is not shown in the Help menu on Mac indeed (#ifndef XP_UNIX).

patch v1.1

This is somewhat late, but it wasn't me who decided to ship 1.0Mac on Nov. 9.

I worked with Mano on IRC and he said it looks good on Mac.
The 1.0mac is going to be removed very soon, use 1.0?

Do all these still display on the Mac?	Double-check and mark those that don't
as " (Windows or Linux)".  (I'm particularly looking at About.)  Also, if For
IE is Win-only, mark it as " (Windows)".

Wrap this in a <div class="noMac"/> please.  You're just leaving the entry but
hiding the header for it on the Mac now.

>+    <h3 id="zoom">Zoom</h3>
>+    <p>Enlarges or Restores the current window.</p>

Remove caps on the Restores.

>+    <h3 id="open-windows">(Open Windows)</h3>
>+    <p>This menu also displays all the open windows by their title.</p>

Remove "also", unless I'm not thinking properly.

Give it a double-check before posting the revised version, please, and with
those changes r=me.  I don't have time right now to look at this any further
due to real life.  Still hoping it can get in in time...
Mano, can you please list the items in the Help menu on Mac? Thanks.

Done.

Oops, done.

Done.

I was referring to additional items below Minimize and Zoom. But it looks right
without it, so I removed it.
