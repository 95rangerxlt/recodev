Dialog storm

This testcase demonstrates the issue without the user needing to push any buttons (except the ok/cancel buttons of the dialog, of course)

I've recently learned (see bug 856977 comment 15 and bug 856977 comment 16) that the "prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" doesn't intend to prevent ALL additional dialogs from being created; it just intends to limit the rate at which new dialogs can be created.

Using the attached test case, I found that my version of Aurora limits new dialogs to 1 dialog every 3 seconds after I've selected "prevent this page from creating additional dialogs."

I find this behavior confusing: I expect a checkbox labeled "prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" to prevent the page from creating dialogs, without exception. Also, I don't really want the ability to rate-limit dialogs on a page; I want the ability to disable them completely.

I'm leaving this bug open, pending the outcome of discussion about this behavior.

Patch v1

This patch should be applied on top of the patch in bug 856977.

This patch removes the rate-limiting behavior for dialogs and prefers a simpler enable/disable mechanism.

I haven't yet built/tested this patch.

This seems fine, assuming we've agreed on the behavior.

Hmm, I guess this is just fixing a bug introduced by the patch for bug 856977? Ideally that patch would have just done this to begin with, right? Or am I missing something?

The patch in bug 856977 renamed "preventFurtherDialogs" to "limitDialogs" in order to make the existing behavior more obvious: The bug existed before the patch for bug 856977, it's just that now the function is named appropriately so it's more obvious that there's a bug.

The patch in bug 856977 hasn't landed yet, so I'm happy to include this change as part of that patch instead of this patch. We've already fixed another similar instance in that patch (bug 856977 comment 39).

Oops, this is inaccurate. nsIDOMWindowUtils.preventFurtherDialogs calls nsGlobalWindow::PreventFurtherDialogs with an argument of 'true,' which would indeed disable dialogs (instead of rate-limiting them).

I've updated the patches in this bug and in bug 856977.

Selecting "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" on an alert/prompt/confirm should prevent all future alert/prompt/confirm on that page



bug 910501. Remove the rate-limiting behavior of the "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs" checkbox. That behavior was unintentionally added and is confusing. r=bz,gavin
