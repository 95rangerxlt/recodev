When there is an HTML "title" attribute on an element of a page loaded in the
sidebar, the tooltip does not appear for the attribute.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
This is just one example, as it's the main sidebar I use which would have
tooltips on it.
1. Go to http://sitebar.org/sitebar3/ .
2. Click on the link "SiteBar" in "Mozillazine topic describes how to use
SiteBar sidebar extension" which will install the sitebar extension.
3. Click on the link "SiteBar" and hover over some of the buttons up the top to
confirm that the tooltips are there.
4. Open the SiteBar sidebar and hover over the same buttons.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens while hovering over the buttons.

Expected Results:  
Tooltips should have been displayed, the same as if the page were loaded in the
main frame.

Same problem here.
Try opening e.g. this page: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ in the
sidebar, and when hovering the mouse over the mozilla logo at the top you should
see the text [Return to homepage] in a tooltip. This works fine in a normal
window, but the tooltip doesn't show up if the page is loaded in a sidebar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add this link as an bookmark: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/
2. Go to Bookmarks|Manage Bookmarks and right click on the bookmark you added
and select properties
3. Click the "Load this link in the sidebar" checkbox
4. Close the Bookmarks Manager
5. Select the bookmark you added in your bookmark menu and watch the link open
in a sidebar
6. Try to hoover the mouse over the mozilla logo

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens when hoovering the logo

Expected Results:  
Tooltips should have been displayed, the same as if the page were loaded in the
main frame.

first, this isn't the same tooltip as the bookmarks toolbar, second, it doesn't
 quite seem to work right, and third, I don't think we want every sidebar to
have this.
I thought it should be possible in any sidebar, but really I'm easy, as long 
as custom sidebars like Sitebar work properly.

> first, this isn't the same tooltip as the bookmarks toolbar, second, 

Why should this be the same tooltip as in bookmarks-toolbar? It should be the same like on any other webpage. FYI, I can see no difference between the tooltips in the bookmarks toolbar an the tooltips from this patch.

> it doesn't quite seem to work right, 

I have no problems with this patch. What does not work right?

> and third, I don't think we want every sidebar to have this.

Why not? For example an this ( http://de.selfhtml.org/navigation/sidebars/html.htm
 ) sidebar, this is really annoying, because, you can't see the tooltips from the red X'es, when hoovering them.
There is no reason, why we would hide the tooltips from the user intentional. This is like saying: "It's not a bug, it's a feature, we want wo hide these evil tooltips from the user".

I posted Bug 383834, which is a duplicate of this bug. Is it fixed in the current build (2.x)?
2.0.0.5 certainly still exhibits the problem.  It's pretty easy to verify.

2.0.0.6 still exhibits this problem. 

On my linux box making the change as described by Jonathon Haas makes them work as expected. Please can his patch be applied for the next release?
Whoops I meant HÃ¥var I. Henriksen's patch resolves this issue.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 244371 ***
This bug is about displaying a webpage in the sidebar, and not allowing showing tooltips (/titles).

This is not a duplicate of bug 244371 which is strictly for bookmarks and history.

This bug see comment #1 which is not about looking at bookmarks in the sidebar, but about the sidebar brought up when using option in a bookmark to display the bookmarked webpage into the sidebar.   See comment #7 from Mike Conner specifically stating that this is NOT the same as tooltips on the bookmarks toolbar; therefore, this should not be  resolved by pointing to bug pertaining to bookmarks. 

Other bugs about use of webpages in side bar have been pointed to this bug.

Working patch

This patch fixes the problem and Mike's review (comment #7).

It displays a tooltip over webpages only, it doesn't display a tooltip over any other sidebar (e.g.: bookmarks and history sidebar bug 244371)
