This isn't reversing the list so it ends up uncrossing out the wrong one when you add these to the same rule:

background: red;
background: green;

It'd be nice to encode this behavior into one of the new tests also (of course you'll need to manually add the two rules with the same name within the test for now since we don't have authored styles)
