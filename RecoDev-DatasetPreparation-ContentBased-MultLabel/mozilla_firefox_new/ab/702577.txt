Font Family Tooltip

It should look something like this (screenshot courtesy of Lea Verou).

The code she users for her previews is at https://github.com/LeaVerou/dabblet/blob/master/code/previewers.js

She says that if we use her code (with changes) we should credit her in the file header.

Unfortunately, we really need to finish bug 918716 before starting work on this.

Hi Mike, I did some quick hacking to get the font-family tooltip to work using a similar approach by Lea Verou. Right now, it doesn't parse the individual font-family properties into their own tokens (eg, font-family: arial, cursive => tokens: 'arial', 'cursive') and displays the token being hovered on. I am looking for some early feedback on how to proceed.

The approach I took is the following:
- Added a check for font-family property when a tooltip target is hovered on
- Construct a description element with some predefined text content and set the style to the given font-family value.

Added a screenshot of how it currently looks. I should note if there are multiple fonts provided, it defaults to the first one.

Looks great so far. Can you also add this for the computed view?

Added tooltip to computed view and test cases! Thanks for the feedback and demoing during the work week!

Looking good, just a couple more tweaks.

Seems like our implementation is buggy here. There are two types of properties, shorthand and longhand. The tooltips should work on both e.g. when font: arial is used, expanded and it's font-family is hovered. Try something like this, it should work on both:
    // Test for font family
    let propertyRoot = target.parentNode;
    let propertyNameNode = propertyRoot.querySelector(".ruleview-propertyname");

    if (!propertyNameNode) {
      propertyRoot = propertyRoot.parentNode;
      propertyNameNode = propertyRoot.querySelector(".ruleview-propertyname");
    }

    let propertyName;
    if (propertyNameNode) {
      propertyName = propertyNameNode.textContent;
    }

    if (propertyName === "font-family" &&
        target.classList.contains("ruleview-propertyvalue")) {
      this.previewTooltip.setFontFamilyContent(target.textContent).then(def.resolve);
      hasTooltip = true;
    }

Not your fault, we do this wrong almost everywhere.
Thanks for the review Mike! I will try to submit a revised patch sometime today.
I don't understand why would someone want this. I mean it's just a duplication of the current font inspector tool. I think a font swatch linking to the font inspector would be more appropriate.

It follows the UI pattern of showing contextual information about a CSS value when hovering over it - we do the same with a few other properties already.  The font inspector can be used if you want more information about the fonts being used, but this will be very useful to get a quick look at each font in the stack.

Well, I think the font-family tooltip is less important. So maybe adding a 500ms delay to avoid accidental hover ?
gluong: For now let's not special case any tooltips so no added delay etc. Just address my comments and we can go from there.

Finally had a chance to work on this :)

Addressed shorthand properties with this new patch. Added shorthand property unit test - needed to click on the font expander, and query the computed list to get the font-family inside the shorthand property of font. 

Also, I wanted to make sure Lea Verou gets a special mention if this eventually lands. I basically adapted her work from her previewer.
Would probably be fair to give Lea a hat tip in a future hacks post. I'm nominating Brian to handle that...

Gabriel: Do you know what license Lea's work is under? https://github.com/LeaVerou/dabblet doesn't have any obvious license.

What of the patch is based on Lea's work? Is it just setFontFamilyContent() ?

Yes, setFontFamilyContent() would be based on Lea's work. However, no particular code was reused here, but the methodology she used was custom tailored for our case - using XUL element to display a description label and setting the text content and font family style.
In addition, the CSS styles in .devtools-tooltip-font-previewer-text (common.css) was actually reused from Lea's work.

Hope that helps!
I will review after we have a green try:

I've heard a number of people say "10 lines" as a point where we need to think about copyright, and "based on" is legally part of copying. If that's right, this is somewhat borderline from a copyright POV.

There's also the 'doing the right thing' POV, and adding a mention of Lea's work to the comments for setFontFamilyContent seems fair, and doesn't fall into the issues of the original BSD license [1].

So I propose:

1. Gabriel adds a comment to setFontFamilyContent that says "This is based on Lea Verou's Dablet. See https://github.com/LeaVerou/dabblet for more info" or something like that.

2. We needinfo Lea to check that she's happy with that.

3. If we have trouble, we ask Gerv.

I took off the checkin-needed flag while we do this.

I have contacted here previously about this. Her response:

Hi Mike,

As long as I'm properly credited, feel free to use whatever, code, ideas, screenshots, anything :)

Cheers,

So Gabriel, can you add a comment to setFontFamilyContent that says "This is based on Lea Verou's Dablet. See https://github.com/LeaVerou/dabblet for more info" and then we should be fine to land it.

Thanks for the help Mike and Joe! I wanted to make sure proper credits was given to Lea. I added the credit to the comments of setFontFamilyContent in the updated patch.
