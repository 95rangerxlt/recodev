Regular failure of this low quality test with some recent changes for cache2 [1] on all/all M(oth).

This test is pretty sensitive, last quite recent change that changed the number of assertions was bug 948901 that touched some FTP stuff!

I suggest to set a range 20-21 here.

The test is checking that representative pages are rendered in RTL in RTL locales. In my case I changed the DOM of one of the pages to fix an unrelated bug, and this triggered some layout assertions which as far as I can tell are unrelated to either the test or the bug I was fixing. Worse, the assertions depended on what was cached, which made reproducing them tricky, and might well explain why you're seeing extra assertions as you tweak the cache.

Could you make sure a bug is filed on the assertions if there isn't one already, and add a bug number to the comment?

(That would be a normal expectation, except that this dates back to the original set of annotations of existing assertions when we started checking for assertions in mochitest, so it doesn't have that.)
