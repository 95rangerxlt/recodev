Reproduced using Firefox 36 beta 1, latest Dev Edition 37.0a2 and Nightly 38.0a1 2014-01-15 under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit and Mac OS X 10.9.5.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to preferences#search
2. Add search keywords for several search engines (not the default one) (eg y for Yahoo)
3. Go to url bar and enter "y <search term>" - yahoo search results page is opened
4. Return to search preferences and remove the search engines with a search keyword
5. Repeat step 3 - the search is performed with the default search engine
6. Return to search preferences and select "Restore Default Search Engines"
7. Perform searches using the search keyword

Expected results:
Either the search using keyword can be made after restoring or the search keywords should no longer be displayed, just like in Firefox 33 and previous builds.

Actual results:
6. The keywords are restored too, but not all the time. 
7. When they are restored and displayed in the table, searches using them are performed with the default search engine.

Notes: After restarting Firefox, the restored search keywords are not displayed anymore.

Notes: After restarting Firefox, the restored search keywords are not displayed anymore.
After looking at the code, I can provide simpler steps to reproduce:
1. Set a keyword on a search engine.
2. Close (standalone dialog) or reload (in-content UI) the preferences UI.
3. Remove the engine with a keyword.
4. Click "Restore Default Search Engines"

After 3., the keyword is actually removed by this code: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cac6192956ab/toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.js#l4269
But the preferences code has a local cache of the default engines and clicking the restore default button rebuilds the displayed list from this cache.

The possible fixes are to remove the alias (the keyword is actually stored internally in a property named "alias") from the cache at http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cac6192956ab/browser/components/preferences/in-content/search.js#l327 or to reset the alias property of the object in the 'e' variable around here: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cac6192956ab/browser/components/preferences/in-content/search.js#l342

This works well :-).

Please make the same change to the browser/components/preferences/search.js file, thanks!

When looking at this in the future, I don't think we'll remember why we had to add this line, so I would suggest adding a comment above this line saying:
        // The search service removes the alias when an engine is hidden,
        // so clear any alias we may have cached before unhiding the engine.
