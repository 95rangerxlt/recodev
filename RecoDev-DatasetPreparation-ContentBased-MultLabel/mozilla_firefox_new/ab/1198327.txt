Could you instead change this line to editor._moveSelectorFocus(newRule, direction) and not make any changes to _moveSelectorFocus?

It looks like that would have the same effect, but then _moveSelectorFocus could keep the more straightforward interface.  In fact, it seems like the Rule argument in _moveSelectorFocus could be removed and could be accessed via this.rule (which would be newRule if you called it on editor in this scope).
