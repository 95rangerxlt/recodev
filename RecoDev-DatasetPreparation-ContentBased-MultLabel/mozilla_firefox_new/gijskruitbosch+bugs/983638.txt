It seems like the fix for bug 940455 won't make 29, so we should try to mitigate the effect of that bug. We can't do much about the lightweight theme case, unfortunately, but the fog case we can work around by adding more margins when you're dragging a tab.

So it seems this is trickier than I thought because the 'movingtab' attribute is set on the .tabbrowser-tabs and the fog is on the toolbar. We'd need to change the tabbrowser code to deal with this, which I'm not a particularly big fan of. :-(
Can we fire a tabdragstart and tabdragend event which the toolbar code can listen for?
Can't we just listen for traditional dragstart and dragend from the .tabbrowser-tabs element instead of introducing new events?

No, because it stops them propagating. :-(
I've started work on this locally and hope to have a patch later today.

This minimizes the effect. To completely eliminate it I'd likely have to move it out of the way of the titlebar buttons still further, which I didn't think was a good idea. Note that especially if the menubar is shown, there might be tabs or buttons underneath the titlebar buttons that temporarily lose their fog. Also note that I've manually approximated the 140px margin that I'm using, which I'm not a terribly great fan of. I don't see a particularly good way of making this more dynamic... but maybe you have ideas, Mike?

This should use _tabDragAttribute here and below.

A fine point.

I changed my Active Title Bar font size to 40px to make the minimize/restore/close buttons huge. The size of the fog margin doesn't adjust to fix this, but it interestingly doesn't overlap these buttons anymore (even if I set -moz-margin-end:0;). I tried using a 'ch' unit for the width here but couldn't find a value that adjusted well with the changing font size.

The 140px you've got here should work for Segoe UI 21pt font, and hopefully most other default fonts for other locales. I'm hoping that the number of users who have extra buttons placed in their title bar are negligible and around 2%.

This 'tabdrag' event is unreferenced and can be removed.

Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Australis + bug 880031
User impact if declined: when dragging tabs, the fog may overlap the window controls
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): locally. We don't need this on m-c or even Aurora because bug 940455 and some of its deps have fixed the problem properly there. 
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low. The express purpose of this patch is to be lower risk, and front-end only, as compared to the riskier changes from bug 940455 and deps. As a downside, this patch will shrink the fog away from the titlebar buttons when you drag tabs. It unfortunately does not solve the issue with lightweight themes and dragging tabs. I don't know of a workable solution to that issue other than the 'real' fix, which is invasive enough that landing it on beta at this point is risky.

Carrying over r+, implemented review comments from Jared (and Gavin's over IRC). I'd quite like this to make the first beta because of how many people reported seeing the tab drag fog overlap issue on nightly/aurora, so I'm setting checkin ? as well. Please *only* check in on beta (29). This patch isn't needed on 31 or 30, because both have proper fixes for bug 940455 and deps.

I tried to reproduce this issue on a Firefox 29.0a2 build (20140315004007):
It took tens of tries to reproduce once bug 940455 comment 0 and bug 940455 comment 2. I reproduced bug 940455 comment 5 easily though, even with less steps (most times I just entered Customization mode with the browser minimized).

I tested Firefox 29.0 beta 7 (20140410150427) for verification:
The first two cases didn't reproduce at all. Given how difficult they were reproduced on the buggy build, I can't say this means they were fixed tough.

The third case still reproduce quite easily. Some times it's enough to open Customization mode with the browser minimized, other times you have to resize the browser to see the issue.

There is also a new bug introduced here: while moving a tab, the right upper corner of the browser gets a lot more transparent than the rest of the application frame. This case and the above issue are both visible in the attachment.

Unfortunately, the fix for bug 940455 didn't fix this for me either (tested the 04/10 Firefox 30.0a2). It didn't introduce the new bug either.

Both issues are visible here: http://screencast.com/t/xryrALkj. The attachment only contains the newly introduced problem.
