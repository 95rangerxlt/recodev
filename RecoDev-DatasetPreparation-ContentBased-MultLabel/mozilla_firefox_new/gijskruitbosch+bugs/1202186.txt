Does this still need to happen? AFAICT this has been fixed at the core level?
If you mean that bug 197791 has fix this. No, it did not fix this problem. console.log() and console.error() do not use nsScriptError. I have open this bug because I do not know this code to decide where is the right place to fix it. The fix is easy if you know the right place.
I don't have access to bug 1197791 to see what the fix looks like, but presumably you'd want to make the same changes to Console.cpp.

Bug 1202186 - use nsISensitiveInfoHidden for console methods, r?past
To be clear, I don't know the code here well enough to be sure this is comprehensive enough, but it seemed to work in my very very very limited testing. I also don't know if/which tests are likely to break because of this change.
