Bug 971096 added linting of all browser CSS.  

Now that DevTools browser chrome tests run in their own dt suite, the DevTools team would prefer to not run the bc suite (to be better citizens with try usage).  However, several engineers have already been bitten by this, since they miss out on linter errors that only show up when running bc.

In order to do this safely, we need to have the current linting test ignore DevTools styles, and create a separate test under the DevTools suite that lints only those files.

include CSS linter test in mochitest-devtools,

Note that filtering mochitest-dt locally will always remove this test (because it's not in a devtools dir) but at least like this it'll run for complete suite runs (./mach mochitest-devtools) and on try.

Sounds good to me.  I pushed to try with dt only and a CSS lint error to confirm that it fails: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=747b076010e0
Ideally, we should expose suite info to mochitests, and then we can make the test only fail in one suite depending on where the failing CSS comes from... which will annoy the sheriffs less. :-)

Makes sense to me overall!

::: browser/base/content/test/general/browser_parsable_css.js:14
(Diff revision 1)
>    {sourceName: /cleopatra.*(tree|ui)\.css/i},

I believe this no longer exists and can be removed.

::: browser/base/content/test/general/browser_parsable_css.js:16
(Diff revision 1)
>    {sourceName: /codemirror\.css/i},

This should be removable with the general exception you are adding here.

::: browser/base/content/test/general/browser_parsable_css.js:35
(Diff revision 1)
>    {sourceName: /highlighter\.css/i,

This should be removable with the general exception you are adding here.

I'm confused. I'm not adding an exception - the test gets run twice in our code, once as part of the devtools suite, once as part of the normal browser suite. In the former case, the highlighter and codemirror are still going to be tested, and found wanting, right? Am I missing something?

Ah right, my mistake.  So then only the cleopatra one needs removing.
