STR:

1. Open customize mode in default state
2. Drop new window button (or, AFAICT, any narrow widget) on top of the edit controls (cut/copy/paste)

ER:
3 small widgets appear above cut/copy/paste, followed by cut/copy/paste, followed by zoom controls

AR:
1 small widget appears above cut/copy/paste, followed by cut/copy/paste, followed by 2 small widgets, followed by zoom controls. 

Sadfaces all around.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_880382_drag_wide_widgets_in_panel.js#133 tests the case with the zoom controls, but not the edit controls.

Test

Test added for this case, it reproduces the failure.
I think this is because we may stop looking for items to rearrange when we hit a wide widget.
I believe Gijs has something in progress for this.

Yes. In fact, I have 2 different approaches in in-progress patches. Both solve this problem, both break other situations/tests. I'll look at this again tomorrow.

wide widget rearranging rearch

This patch actually works. However, I don't like it because it breaks dealing with showInPrivateWindow = false widgets, and makes it hard to add that back in. I also don't like the finnicky 'try to move a bunch of small widgets' loops... ideally we should be able to work out where the wide widgets should go and move those. But hey, working code is useful, so stashing this on the bug for if we don't find anything better.

Wide widget rearranging: derecurse, simplify, improve,

This, I like much better. Simpler, improved comments, and it passes all our tests.
