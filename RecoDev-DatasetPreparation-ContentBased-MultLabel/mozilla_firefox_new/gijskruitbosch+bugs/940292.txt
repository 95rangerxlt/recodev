It seems that exiting customization mode, the scrollbox for PlacesToolbarItems isn't firing/catching the overflow events, and as such you can see in the screenshot that the overflowed item is just being clipped.

This is on the money. We destroy the places view when entering customize mode, and then create a new one. But the new one doesn't seem to get an overflow/underflow event at that point, probably because it's created too late. It should check for that state in the places toolbar helper's customizeDone function. I'll try and come up with a patch.

when using Australis' customize mode, the bookmarks toolbar chevron breaks,

Reworked the code a bit so it was more reusable, and this works like a charm, as far as I can tell. Might fix some of our other issues, too...
