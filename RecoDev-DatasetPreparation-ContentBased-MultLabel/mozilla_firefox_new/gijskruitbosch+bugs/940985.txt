Review of attachment 8335266:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Nice! Instead of duplicating all these rules for first the edit controls, and then the zoom, can you make them of the form:

%define nested-buttons #zoom-out-button, #zoom-in-button, #cut-button, #copy-button, #paste-button

... > toolbaritem > :-moz-any(@nested-buttons@)

to reduce the number of selectors and their length? With that, I'd r+ this!

If you're doing this based on your actual nightly rather than a source tree and need me to change the patch for you, just let me know.

PS: for 'credit' / commit message, is there a real name you want me to use to go with the email address, or should I commit with name 'fx4waldi@yahoo.com' ?

I use latest UX code. 
You commit without real name.
I'll check this in right now, but it needs to have [Australis] in the commit message so we back it out on holly, so I'll do it myself. Sorry for forgetting this yesterday.
