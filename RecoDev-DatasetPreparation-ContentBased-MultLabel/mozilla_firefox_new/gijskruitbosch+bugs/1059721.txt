I realized it after the landing from bug 1057006.

I know it's painful, but for plural form we need the entire localization comment

Also one separated comment for each string.

I'm happy to fix something here, but what do you mean by "entire localization comment" ?

you mean that rather than the * notation you want something like: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/ffc10f34de13/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.properties#l509 ?
We need a localization comment like this on each string

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (stringid):
# Semicolon-separated list of plural forms. See:
# http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Localization_and_Plurals

This form of comment is used by tool to identify plural forms.

I don't think multiple stringids in one comment would work, that's why I said "one per string", even if painful to look at.

Can you elaborate on "work"? Why are we using them everywhere if they don't "work"? Is this issue specific to a particular tool? (which?)

Like this?
Tools for localizations parse comments to display them near the string. This is one of the tools that do that: http://mozilla.locamotion.org/

"Won't work": I simply doubt that such tools will be able to correctly match "getUserMedia.*" (or list of IDs) to all the strings starting with "getUserMedia.".

That explains the part "match a string to its comment".

Plural forms are a special case: how do you recognize a plural form? You can't search for ";", because that's a common character that could be used in a string. So we settle on "parse the comment associated to the string".

Compare-locales is another tool that relies on these comments to display warnings and errors, and it's the tool running all l10n-dashboards
