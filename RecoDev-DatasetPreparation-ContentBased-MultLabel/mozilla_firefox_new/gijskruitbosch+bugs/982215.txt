STR:

1. Make sure the Bookmarks toolbar is visible
1. Open Customize Mode on OSX nightly
2. Drag the Bookmarks toolbar placeholder button to the nav-bar

Resulting issues that can be seen:
1. The toolbar height jumps to a smaller size when the placeholder is dragged out of it
2. When placed in the nav-bar, the placeholder causes all other toolbar items to be mis-aligned.

Wouldn't this be fixed by fixing bug 734326 ?

No, the placeholder button already has different styling than bookmark items. The problem is that the button inside Customize Mode is misbehaving.

bookmarks toolbar shrinks when removing the bookmarks toolbar items,

The 19px change is simply reflecting reality - the bookmarks buttons in the navbar are already 18px with a 1px bottom border. The other min-height is new and fixes the issue at hand.

This does fix the issue at hand.

I'm still unhappy about the state we get in when you drag the Personal Toolbar Items on the nav-bar or TabsToolbar... but that has _nothing_ to do with this bug :)

Most importantly, this patch doesn't regress it further.
