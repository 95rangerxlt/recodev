ive created a test page to reproduce this behavior. youd except icon would change after button click, but it doesnt. the href attribute changes. when i drag a panel into a new firefox window, new icon is already shown, so i guess its problem with user interface rendering.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Test</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="calm.png"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="document.getElementsByTagName('link')[0].href='hot.png';">Simulate Event</button>
  </body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
try the example code in description
Actual Results:  
icon doesnt invalidate

Expected Results:  
icon should change to a new one

it still doesnt work.
You can make this work by removing the <link> node from the DOM, and then reinserting it... See updateFavicon() in the source of http://isthetreegreen.com

The browser UI deals with the favicon by listening for "DOMLinkAdded" events from content. There are no events fired (that I know of) when link attributes change. Other than adding a mutation observer (which is bad for perf),I don't think this is currently possible. Perhaps we could special case this by adding a DOMLinkChanged event?
yes i already found out it was possible to create new instance of link node and delete the old one, and started using it. but i thought, it would be nice if it was possible to use the easier and more elegant way, by editing href attribute. like when you change image source with src attribute, but i understand link is not an image and mostly it's used for nonvisual content (stylesheets for example) so it makes sense that icon does not invaldiate immediately.

allow icons to change when href attribute is set directly,

So this works (testcase: http://gijsk.com/mozilla/testcases/icons.html ). AIUI from bug 481688 these events shouldn't be visible to content either way, so adding another one doesn't seem like a big deal. For the browser part, note that while I've updated some terminology, 'addicon' already really meant 'seticon'. This wasn't the case for feeds and search (note how we don't do anything when these elements get removed, either...), and so I've just added guards so that we don't change behaviour here. I'm happy to remove one or both of those, but this seemed the safest bet.
Marco, can you add this?

Annnnnd a test. Try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=b983579b20d2
Hi Gijs, can you mark this bug as [qa+] or [qa-].
There's an automated test, so I don't think this needs QA attention.
