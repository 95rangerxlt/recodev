Yosemite is out in the fall of 2014. Presumably we don't want to look out of place for too long after it's out. Firefox releases in the fall:

Firefox 32: September 2
Firefox 33: October 14
Firefox 34: November 25

It looks good, except we can't be too platform specific. We should at least keep the borderless buttons we use.

That version is a bit outdated. Updated attached.

That mockup looks fantastic.  Bear in mind, though, that the blurred image in the toolbar/titlebar region doesn't come from *behind* the window.  It's the actual content *of* the window, scrolled up (similar to a navigation bar in iOS 7).

Firefox on Yosemite Full Screen Design Flaw

Not sure if this is the best place to report but fullscreen mode on yosemite is a bit "awkward".

Safari Full Screen for reference

Here's how Safari looks when mousing over the top of the screen

Feel free to file a new bug :)
Status is resolved: can we get this theme somewhere already?

This is the UX (design) bug, read bug 1040250 instead.
Check out current Aurora or Nightly builds, they already include quite a few adjustments for Yosemite.
