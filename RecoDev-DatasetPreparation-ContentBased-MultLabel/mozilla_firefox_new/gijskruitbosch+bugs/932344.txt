Oh boo. I guess in this case we need to draw the border ourselves still?

Yeah, for private browsing windows - since we're not using the native titlebar gradient (which comes with its own bottom border).
Couldn't we use the native titlebar gradient in private browsing windows, too? I guess we're not using it because the private browsing marker in the top right corner is a background image on the window, and the title bar would cover it... can we make it a ::before on #titlebar, maybe?

We could, but that sounds like it'll introduce more bugs. I think we want to keep a custom design anyway, because in the future we'll have a completely different one (darker than the current one). Can we just take the changeset that removed it and reapply it in the private browsing case only? Sounds like it shouldn't be too bad.
It's also missing in customize mode.
