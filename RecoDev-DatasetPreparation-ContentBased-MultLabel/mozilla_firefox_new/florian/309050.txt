the javascript console when I open the Page Info window:

excellent, thanks.
Tiny nitpicky nit: camelCaps is standard in at least /browser, so it should be

Can you clarify on why this is needed for 1.8b5? What does it break?

It isn't absolutely needed but it's a safe patch.

> What does it break?
The bug breaks the Page Info window (Forms, Links and Media tabs) on pages
containing <iframe style="display: none;">.
For example, on the homepage of http://www.clubic.com (a big french site)
