We want to get this localized as soon as possible.

Maybe this is easiest to do by just landing the trunk patch, but if not we can also just land a strings-only patch.

can you explain what this bug is about?  is it to support localization of UI for one-off searches?

we actually really need that for bugs like 1102323 where its not all that clear that switching to yandex is what users want, and are likely want and need help in switching back to their previous search engine.

whats the planned schedule for this?

Yes.

This bug is about ensuring the user-visible strings of the new UI landed for Firefox 34 in bug 1088660 land in mozilla-central in time to be localized for Firefox 36.

Currently these strings are hardcoded in a patch that landed only on mozilla-beta.

Looks like the deadline to do this is Friday this week.
There was
The expectation is that Flare will ship to all locales in 36. As such, I am not expecting that we're going to break string freeze on 35 for these strings. It is highly preferable that these strings land on m-c before the merge on Friday to keep things simple.

Philipp, while making the strings localizables, I replaced "Add more search providers…" with "Add more search engines…" at the bottom of the preferences pane because I remember madhava saying "providers" is technical jargon we shouldn't use anymore. Needinfo'ing you just to double-check this was the right thing to do. Thanks!

it's not to my knowledge that we'll be switching everyone in 36 to the new UI. Can you double check that? At least, if that's true, it probably shouldn't happen in this bug which is about making the strings localizable.

Why plural ("start pages")?

Yes, good call!

Presumably because there are two pages where it's used (about:home and about:newtab).
However, that seems to be a distinction that will cause more confusion than clarity, so let's go with singular (… search bar, and the start page).

To my knowledge the only reason why flare is disabled for non-en-US is that we couldn't make it localizable for 34. I actually had the same doubt as you, so I asked Gavin on IRC yesterday to be fully sure:

21:17:17 - flo-retina: gavin: on 36, the flare UI should be enabled for all locales by default, right?
21:21:57 - gavin: flo-retina: let's say yes for now

I can split that change to a separate changeset is that makes you feel better :-).
Oops, I added a »the« to that sentence where there shouldn't be one. It should read:

Nightly uses it in the location bar, search bar, and start page.

Hi Florian, can you assign a point value.
We are taking this in 35 too, see bug 1107278.
