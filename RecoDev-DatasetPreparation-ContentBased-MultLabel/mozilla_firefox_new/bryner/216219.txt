bryner: reopen?  or wait until tomorrow's build?
Oops.  Should be really fixed now (tomorrow's build) -- there was a bug with
noticing changes to the pref while the app is running.

I did check after restarting the browser, still got the same thing.

I'll just check this on tomorrow's build.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
