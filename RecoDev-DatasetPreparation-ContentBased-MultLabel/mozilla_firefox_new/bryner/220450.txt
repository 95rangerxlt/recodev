Oups. Modifying title (made a mistake in bug number)
Adding Bug 215981 to comments so that we've got a clickable link.
Someone needs to change this to All/All. The original reporter on the MZ forums
(yusufg) was building on Linux.
Confirmed with MacOS 10.2.6.
Changing to All.
I am the original reporter of the problem, on
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=26878 as the original bug reporter
quoted. It was on Linux.
Johnny, can you take a look at this?
fix checked in.
Thanks a lot for the fix.
