I just spent a while (an hour or so at least) building the current phoenix
source.  Then as chrome was being archived:

updating: skin/classic/global/toolbarbutton.css (deflated 79%)

It would really help to do this check _before_ the compile starts.

Depending on File::Spec 0.8 is not a good idea since this requires a perl
version which is only available on the newest Linux versions (nor it it
recommded to update perl since this breaks other stuff).

IMHO we should update the script to be happy with File::Spec 0.6, otherwise
Phoenix cannot be build on most platforms out there... ;-(
s/it it/is it/
marking blocker, since this blocks attempts to even build the silly thing.... 
(which makes debugging/devel _really_ hard).
Morphing bug a little bit - preprocessor.pl should not rely on perl versions
which are not available on most platforms (and are buggy, too).
File::Spec 0.8 can be installed on installations all the way back to 5.00x.
Indeed I developed the preprocessor on a system with perl 5.005_03.
DO NOT MORPH MY BUGS, DAMMIT.

I don't care what phoenix depends on to build.  That's their decision.  I care
that it takes over an hour of building on a fast machine to find out it won't
build.   Use configure -- that's what it's for.

Unmorphing.

The problem is that _none_ of my system-installed versions of Perl have this
thing. This includes Solaris 2.8, SuSE Linux and Debian Linux.
And IMHO it is a very very BAD idea to try to modify the system version of Perl
- and just installing a 2nd version of Perl to make phoenix build happy sounds
like an overkill (building mozilla does _not_ require this).
You don't have to install them system-wide, you can install them in your local user.
That's not what this bug is about.  See comment 6 again, please.

What about doing some cut&paste and paste the method/function into
config/preprocessor.pl ?
Alternatively I can hookup a patch to use cpp (C preprocessor) for that work...
If you want a bug on "File::Spec v 0.8 should not be needed", FILE IT.  This bug
is not about that issue.

Damn you for making this bug so confusing that it'll never be fixed.

This patch is out of the FreeBSD Ports tree.

Sebastian, your patch contains tabs. It would be great if you could provide a
patch with tabs expanded to spaces (see
http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/mozilla-style-guide.html for details)
Created attachment 129428
remove "use File::Spec 0.8;"

reformated the patch
Can you explain this change?:

- main::include($stack, File::Spec->catpath(File::Spec::Unix->splitpath(@_)));
+ main::include($stack, File::Spec->catfile(dirname(@_), basename(@_)));
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224557#c11
has a snippet of a configure test. It should make use of numeric test instead
of strings for the version number, though.
Filed bug 227078 requesting that we remove the File::Spec 0.8 requirement.
Sebastian, could you answer Hixie's question from comment #4?
(make that comment 15.)
Now that bug 227078 is fixed this is fixed, too.


configure test needed for File::Spec v 0.8
