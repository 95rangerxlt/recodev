Several problems: 1) Can't expand/contract window unless I grab lower-right-hand
corner. If I grab anyplace else, won't work. 2) Can't move window by click-hold
in top area and moving cursor. 3) In list-box, can't scroll properly. Only way
to scroll is by grabing "tab" at right and moving it. 4) Middle scroll wheel
doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
N/A

Expected Results:  
N/A

I'm not 100% certain that the bugs haven't already been reported, but I didn't
see them in the list

Unable to reproduce on identical OS and Firefox build. Any more specifics about
your situation (e.g., do any other apps behave in the same way, etc)?
Ok, let me try to be clear. When I use MSIE, I can drag the window around with 
the cursor by clicking and holding in the Title Bar. I can also enlarge a 
window by draging any edge out, etc. I can't do either with Foxfire. Also, the 
wheel doesn't seem to work at all. There are many other things I can't do with 
the mouse. If you don't have those problems, maybe it's some setting on my 
computer. I have a Logitech Trackball and I've run "mwadvanced_enu.exe" to 
enable certain features in Connectix Virtual PC. (I'm not running Foxfire 
there, but I wanted you to know I'd installed mwadvanced_enu.exe in case it's 
of interest!) I'm here most of the time. If you want to chat by phone or email, 
let me know! My phone # is 503-914-6349... Also, if there's a setting I need to 
make to allow Foxfire to work properly, let me know that as well. Thanks!
Ok, there may still be problems, but I just opened Foxfire, and now it seems to 
be working properly. I'll get back to you if I find anything else. Obviously, 
it must have been something screwed up on my machine before!
