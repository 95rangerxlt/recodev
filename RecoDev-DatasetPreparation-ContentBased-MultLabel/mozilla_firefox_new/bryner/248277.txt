Even after applying the suggested patch 247292, the build does not finish. 
Configuration is

./configure --prefix=/opt/firefox-0.9 \
  --with-system-jpeg --with-system-png --with-system-zlib \
  --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2 --enable-xft \
  --disable-gnomevfs \
  --enable-extensions \
  --enable-optimize='-O2 -march=pentium3' --disable-debug --enable-strip \
  --enable-cpp-rtti --enable-cpp-exceptions

After a few trivial problems like the one mentioned abv. or a bogus 'extensions'
subdir in some Makefile, compilation finally stops when a missing
'nsIExtensionManager.h' is encountered, which seems to be a generated file from
a corresponding IDL file (which seems to be present in the source archive).

Reconfiguring without '--enable-extensions' did not yield any difference.

Where do i get the missing file or how do i generate it?

It should be contained in the source archive or the makefiles should try to make
it (and fail if some necessary IDL compiler is missing).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure as described abv.
2. fix the trivial problems
3. make
4. wait ;-)

Actual Results:  
The build fails

Expected Results:  
A successful build

Linux with kernel 2.6.7, gcc 3.3.3, glibc 2.3.2, gtk 2.2.4 & companions, libIDL

I was also encoutering build problems from around that time.

All of my builds are now working.  

Also, as far as I know, --enable-extensions does nothing unless you specify the
extensions to enable.
--enable-extensions enables _all_ extensions.  But the extension
manager does not compile, probably extensions should be explicitly
disabled.  xpinstall seems to depend on the extension manager, as
xpinstall/src/nsInstall.h requires nsIExtensionManager.h.

Probably xpinstall should be explicitly disabled, too.

Extensions must neither be enabled altogether nor be disabled.  The correct
subset is set in mozilla/browser/config/mozconfig (which i copied to
mozilla/.mozconfig, as not all of them were applicable for my build).

After a misconfigured build, all generated Makefiles have to be removed; in fact
i removed all recently created files with -mtime -7.

The patch given below fixes a problem with gcc 3.4.0; it must of course be
applied AFTER the total cleanup!

Afterwards, the compilation went through smoothly.
