Eep.  Firefox-win32.zip jumped from 6.7M to 9.8M between
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-03-29-09-trunk/
and
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-03-31-09-trunk/.
I love our win32 build box, I really do...
could it be due to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170006 ?
See also the win32 zips in the following nightly directories:

2004-03-09-17-trunk
2004-03-09-20-trunk
2004-03-10-09-trunk

where the zips are a whopping 13.1M! 

they contain crap like: 

codesighs.exe
mangle.exe
maptsvdifftool.exe
mfcembed.exe
msdump2symdb.exe
msmap2tsv.exe
rebasedlls.exe
winEmbed.exe
xpcshell.exe
xpicleanup.exe
xpidl.exe
xpt_dump.exe
xpt_link.exe

Were similar build instructions used for the above 3 builds as well as the
builds mentioned in this bug? Btw, what's wrong the the build machine? :)
This is interesting...

I've been doing builds with MS VS 2003.NET, and I noticed the problem from the
following bug in my builds:
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233514

What is interesting and applicable to this bug is that when I add the following
lines to my mozset.bat file:
set MOZILLA_OFFICIAL=1
set BUILD_OFFICIAL=1

the extra files (winEmbed.exe, mfcembed.exe, etc.) are added to the finished
build in dist/bin.  However, if I don't set those variables (and thus, end up
with a BuildID of 0 (see bug 233514)), the extra files are NOT included.  Thus,
I'm wondering if there is a connection here.  In any case, if this doesn't make
any sense, sorry for the spam.
fixed by removing the following files during packaging:

msdump*
msmap*
shlibsign*
winEmbed.exe

Nightly zips include winEmbed.exe
