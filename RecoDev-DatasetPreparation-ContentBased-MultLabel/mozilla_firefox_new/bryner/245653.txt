- Does this actually break the beos build?
- If so, why?
- If we want to not build this, it should be ifdef'd in
browser/components/migration/src/Makefile.in as well.

Have you taken a look at that file?
From Makefile.in:
ifneq ($(OS_ARCH),BeOS)
CPPSRCS += nsDogbertProfileMigrator.cpp
endif

That's why the build is broken in the first place, the Makefile.in is already
correct.

r/a=me for landing on aviary/trunk
I'll close this one when I can get a full build and verify. Currently stuck on
bug 251327
mconnor, could you please commit this to AVIARY.

(I should get myself a CVS account).
hrm, at this point it needs approval-aviary from a very small group, set the
flag, once its approved I can land it

a=asa for checkin to aviary.
mconnor, can you please check this in so it can be closed?

(Firefox for BeOS will build from CVS with this checkin which makes me very happy).
checked into trunk and aviary branch


components/build/nsModule tries to build with dogbert migration under BeOS, causing build to fail. AVIARY_1_0_20040515_BRANCH
