A new approach to the search provider bar that providers switching between providers to show inline results/suggestions where possible. Expands to show gallery of additional providers if user adds more than the default set of providers.


Prototypes are here:

overflow

Default provider should always be selected when search box has is not in focus or a new tab is opened.

> I want to be able to see suggestions from other search providers before going to a provider's page.

As a user, I would find the UI proposed above too subtle and complex. As a user, I don't have a concept of "search suggestions" being different between search engines. Suggestions are supposed to guess what I am typing, and that's independent from the search engine I use. (As a developer, I understand that's not at all how it works. I am describing the mental model of a *user*.)
Ben - thanks for the feedback. The value of suggest certainly is evident across providers that have similar content like Bing, Yahoo, Google and DuckDuckGo. The mock of concept two focuses the ui to emphasize unique providers that could surface things a lot faster then having to just land on their page and start searching again.

The current UI, when you click any of the providers doesn't respect any of the suggestions unless you use the arrow keys to select a result and then click the provider. This interaction to me feels complicated and like it isn't reflecting a strong mental model. Therefore I think its worth 'exploring via a prototype.' 

I also think there is a value to having predicative suggestions or rich results for the other types of providers (ie. wikipedia, twitter, yelp, etc) since the content can be quite different from what your default search provider might surface.
The prototype is available at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2301433/SearchProvider/Firefox.latest.dmg and a bug has been filed for further polishing, so I'm going to mark this as resolved.
