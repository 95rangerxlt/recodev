patch

The Gecko Profiler addon uses the debugger protocol + the profiler actor when profiling Fennec. This has been broken for a long time now and nobody noticed until a few weeks ago.

The APIs we need are: getSharedLibraries, getFeatures, and the ability to specify thread filters in startProfiler.

This patch adds them. Do I need to add tests? If so, where?

Tests are in toolkit/devtools/server/tests/unit, named test_profiler_*.js. Clone one of them, or augment an existing one, doesn't matter too much.

r+ with test.

Add this into browser/devtools/performance/modules/front.js and browser/devtools/profiler/utils/shared.js as well (PerformanceFront.prototype._customProfilerOptions). This code duplication is unfortunate, but will be fixed with bug 1075567.

Do these new methods work while the profiler is not active? Do we care if they don't?

I made the changes you requested and added test_profiler_getfeatures.js and test_profiler_getsharedlibraryinformation.js.

The new methods can be called while the profiler is stopped. I added comments that say so.
