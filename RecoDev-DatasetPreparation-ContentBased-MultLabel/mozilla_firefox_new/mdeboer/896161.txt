Patch for UX branch (already landed)

Patch restoring backForwardItem.title at the end of browser.dtd
Pushed: https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/4a71a1c953d6
Thinking about this, if we're moving this here, I guess in analogue to bug 889500, we also need to move it on m-c?
Yes, I think that would be good.
I'm checking the last merge
http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/diff/e680128a639e/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd

Should we try to move backForwardItem.title, bookmarksItem.title and viewBookmarksSidebar.label in the final group of gone-for-australis strings before Nov 28?

Possibly. I mean, if the tree was open, I'd do it today. But it's not. If you write a patch, I'd be happy to review, but I don't know if we'll still manage to get it in (and/or how useful that'd still be if we're merging on Monday (Nov. 18!))
Right, not sure were 28 came from... I knew it's next Monday :-)

It's not really important to land this before Nov 18, since the balance of strings is the same, it's definitely important to have it before merge day. Not sure if this concerns the parallel branch without Australis though.

I'll have a patch ready in a few minutes.

Move unused string in browser.dtd to bottom of the file (patch for mozilla-central)

I used the same order of the current browser.dtd in projects/ux. 

A diff between the patched file on central and the one currently in projects/ux only gives you new strings, so we should be good.

Excellent, thanks for the quick patch!
Not sure who's (leave aside when) going to commit this. Better to hide the other patch and specify this one is for mozilla-central?

Good point. I'm CC'd on the bugs about reopening the tree, so I can just land this whenever. Or, tbh, as this is just a "make merges easier" thing rather than an actual "change anything" thing, maybe we can land on m-c with CLOSED TREE added. Or maybe that'd confuse people and/or be annoying. Ed?
Whilst this would be fine landing, I think it would just result in the flood-gates opening, so might be best to wait for now.
