Screenshot: customize tab truncated with many tabs

It's a little awkward to exit the customize mode for a few reasons:
- There's not "save" button (which is reassuring even though I realized a split second later I don't need to explicitly save changes)
- exiting by clicking the customize button again is non-intuitive because it's greyed out
- hitting escape will do it, but that's inconsistent with exiting tabs
- with a lot of tabs, the customize tab is cut off, so the "x" is hidden

Finally, there should perhaps be an "undo", if you don't like the changes you made.

I do agree that exiting the mode is awkward. More than once, I've seen people attempt to exit the mode by clicking on "customize" again. It's pretty consistent behaviour for first-timers.

Perhaps we should make that a trigger to exit customization mode.

I believe this is a known bug with the Australis tabs.

Kinda. It's a mix of bug 875180 and the shrinking of the tab strip while entering customization mode. The bug would be reproducible without Australis tabs but less would be cut off.

I click this all of the time to exit and find it natural. IMO, if we do this, the button should be a toggle and stay in a depressed state while customizing to make it more obvious how to get out of the mode.

There is also bug 870866 to make the menu panel button in the pressed state.
Instead of making it a toggle, IMO text should change into "Save & Exit" or "Save Customization", or something like that. 

The question then is if just closing the tab will preserves the changes, or if the user rather expects the changes to not be saved (maybe with an "are you sure" prompt) …

Hence why we don't want a "Save & Exit" type button :)

How about simply "Done"? It's somewhat ambiguous as well, but seems much better than having to hunt around for one of several unclear ways to exit customization mode.
We removed this in bug 858660, since UX wanted to see what it was like without it.

Madhava - you've had a few weeks to try this... should we put it back?

Because we don't want users to have to feel that they need to click a button to exit. They should just be able to close the tab.
I like the idea of making the Customize button a toggle to exit the mode.

Me too. I think the subtle cues like a pressed Customize button and a pressed Menu Panel button are nice to have since they don't jump out at the user as saying "this is the only way to exit".

Once we put a "Done" or "Save" button, I have a very strong belief that users will this it is the only way to exit.

Hm, the open'ed Customize button when in the Customize Mode doesn't really look "pressed in" to me. Kinda looks like it is sticking out. Does it have an inset shadow? Can we try adding one?

Otherwise, the code changes look fine.

I think we should leave the menu icon in the open state (blue) and add the pressed state to the Customize button (we need this for open subviews as well) Also maybe change the + to an X as a subtle queue.

Version 2.

Okay, this is nothing like Stephen's mockup, since that would involve huge changes, but this is more like what Jared was asking for.

Comments welcome, as always.  :)

Thanks,
Blake.
And the screenshot…  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2301433/Screenshots/CustomizePressed2.png
Instead of implementing this change and then another change to get the button looking right, can we just start on implementing Stephen's new design? Would it be possible to just implement the changes to the bottom of the panel now and do the rest of the panel in a separate bug?
If by "we", you mean someone other than me, then sure!  ;)

(I mainly took this on as a quick attempt to make it a little better for the UR build.  (That's also why I didn't assign it to myself.)  If we want to jump straight to Stephen's new design, then it's not going to make the cut-off of tomorrow, and I'm happy to let the patch slide…)

We should be able to drop the #PanelUI-mainView from the selector. The #PanelUI-customize-btn doesn't show up anywhere outside of the #PanelUI-mainView.

Also, we need to add a :hover style for #PanelUI-customize-btn.

Do we?  The toolbar button I stole the styles from doesn't have a :hover…

Ah, the pitfalls of testing on Mac first.  I ran this on my Windows box this morning, and yes, we totally need a hover style.  Fixing that now.  :)

V3, with all comments so far fixed.

So, Jaws was the original reviewer, but I'm also asking mconley, in case he wants to do a quick review steal.

Tested on Mac and Windows, and looks decent (imo, thus the ui-r? for shorlander).  Untested on Linux.

Thanks everyone!

All of these '!important' usages can be removed if we modify the earlier selector for '#PanelUI-mainView #PanelUI-customize-btn' to remove the '#PanelUI-mainView ' part, since the customize button will never appear outside of the PanelUI-mainView. You'll also want to move these rules to be a little lower in the CSS file so that they follow the generic toolbarbutton styling here.

I don't think we should show the blue design while the panel is still open and the browser isn't in customize mode. I'd like us to keep the normal pressed-in grey look when the panel is still acting as a panel.

This is also lacking a :hover state when the blue background should be applied.
