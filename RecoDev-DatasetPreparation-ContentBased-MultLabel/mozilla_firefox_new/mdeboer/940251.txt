In RTL UI the back and forward buttons should point in the opposite direction: back to the right and forward to the left.

In today's build on OSX the forward button still points to the left, but the back button is reversed and also points to the left.

Simon, please see the attachment from comment 1.

I think this looks OK to me and fits the expected result you described in comment 0. In other words, I'm not able to reproduce the issue!

Can you post a screenshot perhaps?
You filed this as an OSX bug, perhaps you noticed this on another OS?

"OSX" is intentional, I see this there but not on Linux or Windows

On clean profile without the themed header, and also showing the title bar buttons on the right.

Patch 1: fix back-button arrow direction in RTL mode on non-retina displays

Moved RTL styling out of toolbarbuttons.inc.css, because it doesn't really belong there and we need to maintain the Windows theme exception.

I think the button shape is symmetric, so it probably doesn't matter, but wouldn't it be safer to mirror only the icon rather than the whole button?

Indeed, the button shape is symmetric. If I scale only the icon - like we do in the Windows theme - on Linux and OSX, the arrow icon seems to visually creep toward an edge. So I opted for the most visually appealing version.

I don't understand why this would happen. Is there an asymmetrical horizontal padding around the icon or something?
On Windows we indeed have asymmetric horizontal padding. This was introduced by Jared in
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b3a5e2a65d1f/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#l574 (bug 571454).

You can see it in its current state at:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/1e3712793e7d/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#l636

So what do you think we should do about this? Keep the exception for Windows and accept this patch or do you know of a solution that'd obsolete the asymmetric padding whilst maintaining the desired behavior from bug 571454?

Why is that relevant? I was referring to Linux in comment 8 and you were talking about Linux and OS X in comment 9.

Patch 1.1: fix back-button arrow direction in RTL mode on non-retina displays

Dão, apology for the miscommunication here, I was out of it the past couple of days.

You're right, Linux theme rule can be more specific. I can also make it more specific for the forward button. I'll do that, if you think that's a good idea.
