The separator is missing, and the right-side icon is weirdly offset.
I think it's good to 'wait' for bug 885086 to be fixed and start fixing other overflow panel styling issues from that baseline.
It looks better now, but the button has a single hover style (at least on OS X), which makes it impossible to tell whether clicking is going to open the Library or star/edit-bookmark the current page.
As this is a landing blocker, we should get an assignee. Gijs or Mike, could one of you take it?
I think the current state is no longer a landing blocker. However, I can probably take it tomorrow if Mike doesn't take it before then.
I'll take it. I'm afraid it'll need input from UX though.
After a brief discussion on IRC: let's not block landing on this in its current state. It might not be optimal, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.

Patch 1: introduce separator in overflow panel buttons

What this patch does is
1) add a separator for all OSs for menubuttons in the overflow panel (only applies for the Bookmark button)
2) Fixes the dropmarker icon dimensions on Windows
3) Does not show the hover state of the button inside the menubutton anymore on Windows and Linux (where this was an issue).

Patch 1: introduce separator in overflow panel buttons

Clearing review pending investigation as per IRC discussion related to the double rule here:

+#widget-overflow-list > .toolbarbutton-1 > .toolbarbutton-menubutton-dropmarker > .dropmarker-icon,
+#widget-overflow-list > #bookmarks-menu-button[cui-areatype="toolbar"] > .toolbarbutton-menubutton-dropmarker > .dropmarker-icon {
+  padding: 0 6px;
+}

and trying to make the browser.css rule that the second selector is overriding more generic so that that's not necessary.

On Windows this looks significantly worse, especially when hovering the item. Also the icon on the right is not displayed completely.

The click-able area for list should be larger than area of bookmarking.
Design decision: only add separator.
String change in overflow mode: Change to 'Bookmark This Page'

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This patch looks excellent. As we're using generic styling, did you check that this fixes (or at least doesn't make things worse for) the overflow panel styling issues raised in bug 940307 ?

This conflicts with the patch Marco just landed. I *think* you need both your :not clause and his, but please doublecheck.

These should be documented with the other event listeners both in this file and on the MDN page for the module. There might even be a bug on file about this.

This is a fair point. In fact, why isn't that code using aNode - isn't that guaranteed to be the node we care about anyway?

It is. I'll post a follow-up patch shortly.
