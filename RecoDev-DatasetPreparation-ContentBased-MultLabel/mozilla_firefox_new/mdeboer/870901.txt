The Cut/Copy/Paste button in the panel needs to be able to be removed.

When it goes into a toolbar, it should be icons only, but still bound in the cut/copy/paste order.

The old individual cut, copy and paste buttons should be removed.

I just removed the existing buttons; please remember to update the code here:

as it'll need to check for the existence of the new edit controls.

Is that a regression from this patch, or a separate bug that was already present?

Ok, if that's the case, we don't block on it, but we should file a follow-up bug. I'll do that now.

Note that this didn't touch the hunk I mentioned in comment #1, and possibly should have.

Mike (Conley), can we make that code just check for one of the buttons, or is the overflow stuff in the navbar going to make that not always work and should we check for all 3? Mike (de Boer) also told me he didn't see any issues enabling/disabling the buttons as-is. Just needinfo'ing you here to see what we do about this, if anything.

Good point. I'll file a follow-up.

I think we should be fine just checking for the root item - the cut, copy and paste buttons will always be contained in it, overflowed or not.

Yep, should still be fine.
