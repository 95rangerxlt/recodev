FWIW, I think Matt and I aren't convinced that's just bug 870593's fault... could be one of the other things in that range as well.

Patch v1: hide the tip panel by default to prevent Talso regressions

Review of attachment 8387063:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Looking at the compare talos, the only thing that immediately stood out was the 12% ts_paint regression.

_HOWEVER_

looking at the individual ts_paint numbers in your "after" push[1], it looks like you have a few outliers in the 1000's, which looking at the history of ts_paint, is not unheard of. So I think that's all we're seeing here - some unlucky outliers.

Otherwise, it's clearly putting as back in the black. Nice one, Mike!

Let's do this.tipPanel.removeAttribute("hidden") instead.

Better yet, this.tipPanel.hidden = false;

(hidden is a "magic" XUL attribute: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/02506bdd5bd8/content/xul/content/src/nsXULElement.cpp#l1415)
Sounds good to me.

Patch v1.1: hide the tip panel by default to prevent Talso regressions

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): bug 870593
User impact if declined: none, this is mainly to fight the Talos perf regression
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): merged to m-c
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): minor
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: n/a
An addendum - user impact if declined is that the user is likely to experience slower times for the window to paint, and jankier tabs. Basically, this patch just makes everything faster and better for our users.

I would have just rolled this into the Aurora patch for bug 870593 if I were you, but it doesn't hurt to track them separately.
(we certainly can't land that patch without this one, though)
Landed in one combined patch on aurora, together with bug 870593 and bug 980369:

https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/92c7529e9169
