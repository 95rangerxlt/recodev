The process of dragging the Web Developer tool onto the toolbar on Australis/Ubuntu 13.04 (x64)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20130727 Firefox/25.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130727040218

Steps to reproduce:

Dragged the Web Developer tool onto the toolbar on latest Linux x64 UX Nightly (Australis) on Ubuntu 13.04 x64.


Actual results:

See attached image - instead of showing the Web Developer icon, the button shows up as the whole image sprite of multiple icons. The button remains usable, as it shows the dropdown menu of Web Developer tools when clicked.


Expected results:

The button should have shown up as the same icon visible on the tools tray, before it is dragged on the toolbar. Dragging the icon to the hamburger/hotdog menu works as expected and the correct icon is shown.

Patch v1: fall back to using menu panel sprite for buttons introduced by Australis on Linux

Mike, I made the developer button and character encoding widget use the menu panel spritesheet to at least show something relevant to users on Linux.

Yeah, I guess this is fine until we get a permanent solution for Linux GTK.
