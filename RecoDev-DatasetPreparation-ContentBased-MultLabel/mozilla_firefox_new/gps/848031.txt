https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/c95439870e05/browser/base/content/abouthealthreport/abouthealth.js#l63 performs a |.innerHTML = | with a value that may contain unescaped HTML-like strings. e.g. if the JSON contains a string with "<", the produced HTML will be invalid and the feature won't work.

This is theoretically an attack vector. If untrusted content could result in an arbitrary string being added to the FHR payload, that string could eventually make its way into the DOM of a chrome-privileged page and code execution could ensue.

I don't believe untrusted content can currently cause injection of arbitrary strings into the FHR payload. But, this may not always hold. We should keep this door closed.

Even if there isn't a security issue here, the issue of 'payloads containing "<" fail to render' is a legitimate bug that needs fixed and preferably uplifted to Aurora.

Don't use innerHTML on untrusted data, v1

I /think/ this will do it. raw-data is a leaf node, so textContent should be equivalent to innerText. But I'm not a DOM expert.

I have a bug open somewhere to track test coverage of FHR's browser components. Can't find it though...

Parts of this page are due to be rewritten shortly. Hopefully tests will be part of the refactor.
