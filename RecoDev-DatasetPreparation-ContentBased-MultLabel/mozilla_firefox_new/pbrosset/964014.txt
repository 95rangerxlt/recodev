I wanted to file this bug at the same time :)
Indeed, useful, and easy.

- The inspector has a contextual menu (in inspector.xul): inspectorPopupSet. It's easy enough to add one item in there "copy as data-uri" that would be enabled only for image nodes.
- NodeActor objects have a handy method called getImageData() that returns the data-uri for any image node.
- We can import the nsIClipboardHelper service and use its copyString method to get the data-uri into the user's clipboard!

bug964014-Adds-copy-datauri-to-images-in-markupview v1.patch

This patch adds the following things:
- new menuitem in the inspector.xul menupopup
- logic in inspector-panel.js to switch that item on and off depending if the selected node is an image or canvas or not
- new function in markup-view.js to actually do the copy, this function sends a request to the NodeActor to get the image data (the getImageData actor method was already present)
- a new mochitest
Thanks Heather for the review.

I'm not sure how to translate "Copy Image Data-URL". How is it different from "Copy Image URL"?

It is different because the image url points to the original resource on its server, whereas the image data-url contains the image itself.

A data-url looks like this: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAA....

Since it's a standard url, it can be used in the browser location bar, or as a background-image in a CSS stylesheet for example, but instead of pointing to a remote resource, it actually contains the data of the image (encoded in base64).

So clicking on "Copy Image Data-URL" will actually extract the data from the image, and turn it into a data-url.

Ok, now I get it, thanks.
