The v3 of the animation-inspector panel has landed in FF43. This means we now have a toolbar above the timeline that can be used to control the animations displayed in the timeline.
We should add a playback rate selector in this toolbar.

Bug_1211801_-_Add_a_playback_rate_selector_to_the_.diff

I think this can go through a first round of review.
I've added tests.

The code changes are quite small, but I'm especially interested in getting someone else to play with the UI a bit and report problems.

Things you need to know:
- the plabackrate selector is in the animation-inspector toolbar, next to the rewind and play buttons
- it's a drop-down, but I made it look like the other buttons in the toolbar
- choosing a different value in the drop-down will set the playback rate on all animations currently displayed in the timeline
- this means that you can, for instance, select just one animated element and set its playback rate independently from other elements
- you can then also select <body> for instance and set the rate for all nested animated elements at once
- you can change the rate whether the animations are playing or paused.

One page I often use to test these kinds of features is: http://tympanus.net/Development/DialogEffects/ricky.html
because the animation-inspector is most suited for inspecting these kinds of animations.
But it should work on any kind of animations.

Last try build had some failing tests. These are due to the new test I added. This test simulates mousedown/up events somewhere over the animation panel and that, somehow, causes later tests to receive mouseover events which make them fail.
I made a fix (patch not uploaded yet): https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=9c28b5593837

Here's an updated patch with the test fix mentioned earlier.
Matteo, your input on this would be great. If possible, I'd like to land this in 44.

Matteo seems busy right now, Mike has agreed to take a look at this.

Looks great.

It is up to you whether to change your catches but please remove the whitespace.

I have already logged bug 1218760 for creating no-trailing-whitespace.

You can use:
.catch(console.error);

Sorry about the whitespaces, this must have come from a manual merge in kdiff3 (in sublime I have both the eslint rule enabled to warn me about them *and* auto trailing-whitespace removal on save).
About catch(console.error), I can't do this as this would lead to this error: "TypeError: 'error' called on an object that does not implement interface Console.", so catch(e => console.error(e)) is required here.

Addressed review feedback. Rebased.
Pushed to try one last time: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=68c53bf802a9
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/56e48254df7c
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/56e48254df7c
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-b2g44_v2_5/rev/56e48254df7c
removing the b2g 2.5 flag since this commit has been reverted due to an incorrect merge, sorry for the confusion
Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]: This lets users of the firefoxdevtools change the playback rate of css animations
[Suggested wording]: The playback rate of animations displayed in the animation-inspector's timeline can now be changed. Making animations run slower is useful to fine tune them.
