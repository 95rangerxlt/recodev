bug1113552-use-add_task-in-timeline-tests.patch

Paul, this is only a test change that makes the timeline tests look like the rest of the tests in our codebase, and use the new add_task function.
I also changed the way the toolbox was closed and tabs got removed at the end of the test.
This is a follow-up to bug 1075319.
