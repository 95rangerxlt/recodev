The animation panel is more useful if when a node is selected, all animations on that node + on nodes in its subtree are displayed.
This way, when <html> or <body> are selected, it's possible to see all animations. And at the same time, it's still possible to select a leaf node and see only the animations on that node if needed.

This will require changes to the AnimationsActor.getAnimationPlayersForNode method.
There shouldn't be any backwards compatibility problems here because the front-end has never made the assumption that all displayed players were for one node only, so it should just work if the actor method is changed.

Of course, I didn't run the browser/devtools/animationinspector tests locally, and I should have, 3 of them are failing. That's because with this patch, selecting the <body> node in the inspector now shows all animations. It used to show no animations at all, and that's what these 3 tests were assuming.
I'll fix these tests and upload a new patch for review.

There are 2 remaining intermittents in the browser/devtools/animationinspector tests. Working on a fix now.
This will be a test-only fix anyway, the main part of the patch won't change.

Ship It!
Thanks Mike.
One last try push: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=a46154c80b38
All green except for seemingly unrelated failures on linux e10s. I don't see how my patch could make this test fail. So I'll push to try:

AnimationsActor should return all animation below a given node
