When bug 1120833 will be implemented, the animation panel will refresh when animations are added or removed, so this bug is required.

STR:
- https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/714210/transition.html
- Open the animation inspector panel
- Select the <div> in the inspector
- Click on the <div> in the page
=> 2 transitions appear in the panel (width and height)
- Click on the <div> again
=> 2 new transitions appear. This is somehow fine because they are different transitions.
- Click again on the <div>
=> still 2 new transitions. This isn't correct, the panel should manage to see these are the same 2 transitions that were originally displayed and just show these ones as running again.

Also, trying to seek one of the displayed transitions doesn't do anything.

Platform bug 1149990 is where the discussions about how to resume finished transitions will take place.
When the transitions are added, we get a mutation event (thanks to bug 1123523) and with that a list of Animation objects. I just checked and realized that the Animation object is a new one every time. So if we want to re-conciliate with existing Animation objects, we're going to have to use a unique identifier. This could be a pair of DOM Node + transition property name.
One problem with this though: when transitionProperty is "all".
Maybe we could consider "all" transitions as just 1 animation in the inspector. This would require changes to the AnimationPlayerActor because it would not just represent one Animation but potentially several of them.

These 2 parts solve the problem described in the STR in comment 0.
They don't solve yet the last problem where seeking a finished transition doesn't work. That depends on bug 1149990.
Pending try build for parts 1 and 2:

My understanding so far is that when bug 1149990 lands, the problem whereby it's not possible to set the current time of finished transitions in the animation inspector will be solved automatically, so I don't need to leave this open after all, and no need to depend on bug 1149990.
If this doesn't work after bug 1149990 lands, I'll file a new bug then.

Animation inspector doesn't re-conciliate transitions when played several times and doesn't allow to set currentTime/resume
