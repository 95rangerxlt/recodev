and more ...

The interesting bit here is "XrayWrapper denied access to property name (reason: object is not safely Xrayable)" line: 24.

This means that, in e10s mode, the test gets an XRayWrapper for the array of markers returned by popProfileTimelineMarkers and for some reason, markers' names aren't considered as native properties that can safely be accessed, hence the test fails.

It has been deactivated for now.

For inspiration, bholley made some elaborate changes to the console previewers for a similar reason:

Thanks, that seems to be what I need.
However, I can't seem the reproduce the problem anymore, running the test with '--e10s' without changing the code makes the test pass!
Did something change recently?
Alright, so it does look like something changed. Here is a try push that just removes the |skip-if| condition in browser.ini: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=adcc5f534e66
Looks like all tests pass in e10s mode.
Created attachment 8489603
bug1064848-timeline-e10s-test.patch

R+ myself as this is only a minor browser.ini change that enables a test.
