Right now we have a lot of accessibility problems with plugins. PDFs are a very
important content type for all users, including screen reader users. Screen
reader vendors generally recommend that their users set IE to launch PDFs
externally. This is a good thing to do in Firefox as well, and we might as well
choose that setting automatically when a screen reader is running.

When screen reader is present and loading a plugin, check for external handler and use instead it if it exists
This fixes the last big hole in our VPAT.

It even helps deal with Flash, which does not support MSAA in the Netscape
plugin but does in the external viewer.

We can't detect sighted keyboard-only users, so will have to recommend that they
edit the actions under Options -> Downloads -> View & Edit Actions
Requesting blocking status because I have a patch and it fixes our last big
section 508 hole.

nsWebNavigationInfo.cpp:
+	   mimeService->GetFromTypeAndExtension(aType, EmptyCString(),
+					       getter_AddRefs(mimeInfo));

This caused bug 340841. Our check to see if an external handler exists does not work.


When screen reader running, prefer external viewer for full page plugins
