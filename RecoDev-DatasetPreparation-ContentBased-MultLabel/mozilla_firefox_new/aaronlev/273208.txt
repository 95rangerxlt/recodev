Using a PowerBook with Shift_JIS keyboard (Japanese), the keyboard shortcut for
Text-size > increase is not working correctly. The '+' key is mapped to
command-shift +. FireFox doesn't react on this. Other browsers work fine. It I
connect an extended keyboard with numerical keypad, and use the numerical key,
then the text-size is increased.
Applies to both the Avariary 1.0 release (branch, rv:1.7.5) as to the trunk
builds  (rv:1.8a6).

The odd thing is, if I first increase the text on a page using the menu, and
then try to increase the text more with the keyboard, it works.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.load HTML page with small text in
2.try increase the text size via the keyboard shortcut 
3.

Actual Results:  
nothing happens

Expected Results:  
increase text size

With the same build on my Powerbook, OS X 10.3.7: it works sometimes.
Most of the times, the menu item is like 'frozen', something similar as the
problem with the 'Go' menu (bug 260951).

I open a new tab, load an html doc, try to resize the text (Increase) via the
keyboard an nothing happens. But if I go to the view menu, and click on
text-size (not even selecting 'increase'), then the keyboard shorcut works fine.

I should add, this happens both as a 'Japanese' user (OS language: Japanese) and
a 'English' user (OS: English). 
Tested with a fresh profile.

Firefox/1.0+ (PowerBook)
With the landing of the patch for bug 253693 (Cmd+? should bring up Help
Contents), things got stranger: when first opening the browser, the keyboard
shortcut opens the 'help' window.
If I then go to the view menu > Text size (clicking on 'text size', no need to
select either submenu), then use the keyboard shortcut, it works correctly.

This might be caused by bug 280805.

This is not "Shift_JIS keyboard", but "JIS keyboard".

Changing the summary.
This bug appears to be fixed on both trunk 1.9 and 1.8.1 branch, by the patches in bug 50590.

Trunk 20060710 - fails
Trunk 20060711 - works

1.8.1 Branch 20060727 - fails
1.8.1 Branch 20060728 - works

Just reviewed #88380 and imho the two are hardly related in the result.

The same problem occurs on my Win98se Eng platform running Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1   I seem to recall the same problem on an earlier rev, but am not certain.  I note that Ctrl-Shft +/- works, but not the View/Text Size menu's indicated Ctrl +/- keystroke shortcut.  The View/Text Size/Increase or Decrease options always work, but who wants to go three menus deep to activate a function that has always been available on all other browsers--including earlier FF rev's  for a long time?

Ahem. This bug is about a problem specific to Mac (OS X) and  Japanese JIS keyboards. That is clearly indicated in the summary. And the patches in bug 50590 (another Mac specific bug) have fixed this. 

If you have problems with other OS/hardware combos, please check for a bug related to that (bug #88380 might be a good candidate) or file a new one.
