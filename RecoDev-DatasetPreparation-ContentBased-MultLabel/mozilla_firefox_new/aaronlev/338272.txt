This bug is a regression from firefox1.5.0.2.
Confirmed on Windows with Inspect32.  Tested Firefox 1.5.0.3, Bon Echo 20060515, and Minefield 20060516.  Minefield does not expose an accessible name for either the "open" or "remove" button.  FF1.5.0.3 and Bon Echo both work as expected.
Update, I cannot recreate this reported problem w/ the following:
Bon Echo 20060516 & Orca 0.2.2.
Created attachment 222346
Standalone test case to demonstrate the problem.

I verified this with a Friday, May 12, 2006, internal Minefield build from Ginn Chen.
This appears to be fixed in last night's Bon Echo nightly build, but the problem still persists in last night's trunk build.
I think this bug didn't ever exist with Bon Echo builds.

It only appears with Minefield.
Also mark as all platforms according to c#1.

Same logic as nsXULTextAccessible::GetName(). We still want to inherit from nsLinkableAccessible for other behaviors. Also make sure rich list items can have children!

This bug says that it only appears in Minefield. Did you mean to nominate it for approval1.8.1? If so, please renominate explaining why.
Good catch. I did not realize it wasn't a problem there.


Names of buttons are missing in download manager window.
