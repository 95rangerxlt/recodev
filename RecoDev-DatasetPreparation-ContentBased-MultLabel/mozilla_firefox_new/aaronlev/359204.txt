When I look at Firefox using at-poke while Firefox is pointed at http://bugzilla.gnome.org, I cannot find the stuff at the bottom of the page:

Contents of the URL that I looked at (in case they change in the mean time)
Could you try restarting both at-poke and firefox and going to that URL right away?
Still got the same behavior.  Are you unable to reproduce the problem?
Root cause is that we try to walk the frames in HTML. Will be fixing in bug 359210.
feel free to open it if fix of 359210 doesn't work
Looks like you fixed it!  Thanks!
