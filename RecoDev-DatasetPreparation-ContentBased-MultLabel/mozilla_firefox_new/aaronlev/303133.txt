When a frame or iframe is finished loading, we are invalidating the children of
the outer accessible (which represents the frame or iframe element).
Unfortunately, we always create its children on Init() and don't allow
rebuilding of the child information.

Also bad, we always say there is 1 child even if for some reason we can't get
create an inner doc accessible.
