Aaron, we need a fix for this ASAP. It's blocking testing of fixes we need on
the branch.
If this is happening on branch then it's not caused by the fix for bug 303620.
It's not happening on the branch.

This makes no sense. How is this blocking anything on the branch?
Because if it's broken on the trunk, then drivers@ can't insist that other
bookmark-related patches get testing on the trunk before they land on the branch.
Timo said in bug 305840 comment 30 that one version of the "additional patch"
fixed this bug. I have just checked in the final version of that patch.
I can confirm it's fixed on build 2005083014 (trunk).
Looks like I missed one case, the context menu seems to be still broken if you
don't have bookmarks toolbar or bookmarks toolbar content visible.
Timo - comment 25, isn't that bug 246158?
I don't think so, the first comment in bug 246158 says that the context menu is
empty and filled with gray squares. In this case the menu opens like it should
but the menu items are dead (like they were always before the 'additional' patch
was checked in from bug 305840). This doesn't produce any errors in javascript
console either.

To reproduce:

1) Open Customize Toolbar
2) Drag Bookmarks Toolbar Items to the Customize Toolbar
3) Open bookmarks menu and right click a folder or a bookmark
4) Click any of the context menu items

In #3 do you mean the bookmarks sidebar?

I'm not seeing this happen.

I can reproduce that testcase now.

Remove some problematic ::IsFocusable() requirements for XUL

This still leaves more of a visibility check than we had previously.

Mats, feel free to look into this in more detail if you want to save those
checks, but I think we should take them out for now since they are causing
problems, and fixes for branch need to be verified against the trunk.
Comment on attachment 194546

Yeah, that's probably best for now. Please add a XXX comment
saying it allows to much but is needed for this bug.
I'll look into this in more detail when time allows.

... and remove the 'tabIndex' variable too.

This still isn't fixed on Linux nor Windows (bug 307931) when using comment 27's
steps to reproduce.
Okay. Turns out comment 27 is describing bug 246158. Sorry for the bugspam.
