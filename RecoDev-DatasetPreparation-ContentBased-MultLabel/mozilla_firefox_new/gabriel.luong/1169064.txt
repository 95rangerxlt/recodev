Part 1: Move ObjectActor to object.js

Part 1: Move ObjectActor to object.js [1.0]

Just an observation that will be addressed in another patch as part of this bug:
- createEnvironmentActor is implemented the same in both webconsole.js and script.js. I think we can just have one implementation in object.js.
ObjectActor.onDefinitionSite also doesn't use its aRequest argument.

What's different in this revision? Does it warrant rereview? I'm assuming it must be something "big", b/c you reflagged me, but it isn't obvious to me looking at the patch.
Unfortunately, the changes aren't big and it simply readds the actor deletion to LongStringActor#onRelease. I will carry over the r+.
