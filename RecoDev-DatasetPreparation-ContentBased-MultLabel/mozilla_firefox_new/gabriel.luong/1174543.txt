[ruleview] Rules are duplicating in some cases.png

// STR:
1. Run Fx 40.0a2 (2015-06-12)
2. Open any image by direct link
3. Open Inspector, Ruleview -> "Computed". Inspect the <img> element
4. Type 'margin-top' in filter on "Computed" tab of Ruleview
5. Open drop-down list on that tab (like on attachment image)
6.a) Switch between <img> and <body> several times
6.b) Switch between "Computed" and "Rules" tabs of Ruleview several times

// Result:
Rules were duplicating. (This happens REGARDLESS of the E10S state)

Good catch, thank you for the report. This is most likely a fall out form bug 1120616. CCing Gabriel so he can confirm.
I reviewed my changes to computed-view.js in bug 1120616, and nothing stood out to me that should be causing this issue. I haven't looked deeper into the existing code to see what the issue is.

Part 1: Remove processTemplate code
This seems to be a regression from Bug 1136257 where we stopped using the templater.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

One small nit:
You should also be able to remove .rule-text { from browser/themes/shared/devtools/computedview.css:128 because that was a fix for the templater breaking the computed view on rtl locales.
