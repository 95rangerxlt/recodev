The colour used in the source view to indicate a node is changing is ugly, and more importantly hard to read. See attachment.

Please try to use a color from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors, possibly one of the orangish accent colors (possibly with alpha if needed).  Also keep in mind that this color (currently #a18650) is used for flashing variable view and table widget values that have changed.

New highlight colour in the markup view

New highlight colour in the variables view

I should note that the colours do fade quickly and the screenshot for the markup view is more representative of the colour transitions.

You'll need to also update the dark theme using a corresponding color from the colors page.  Take a look at all instances of the string: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=%23a18650&redirect=true.
As discussed on IRC, the current color in the dark theme isn't really too bad.  But I think we could still take this as a chance to update it to be a bit more inline with the rest of the pallete.

I've thought about this a bit more.  We should use non-alpha versions and keep the wiki updated with them, since we are counting these as different from 'accent' colors.  So, first we pick an accent color with alpha, then measure what that actually becomes 'flattened' on the background.

Here are a couple of suggestions (I don't feel too strongly about the final colors, as long as they are derived from the existing palette and look reasonable):

Dark theme:

 * 'Light Orange' with alpha: rgba(217, 155, 40, .8) which flattened becomes: #B28025

Light theme

 * 'Light Orange' with alpha: background: rgba(217, 126, 0, .6) which flattened becomes: #E6B064

Aside: there is one spot that will be trickier to update: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/devtools/widgets.inc.css#1370.  I guess we will need a separate keyframe for light and dark theme then change the animation name for .table-widget-cell.flash-out based on which theme is applied.

Yeah, I commented out the line that removes the BG class when testing locally: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/markupview/markup-view.js#1547

I'm looking at the code, and I don't think you actually need this change - looks like the css changes in widgets.inc.css will handle this case fine already, right?

Add a comment after each usage of the new colors with /* Background - Attention */.  Helps keep track of what's what until the switch to variables.

Fixed. This change was indeed unnecessary. I must've thought I changed the class names to light/dark-flash-out, but in reality those are the keyframes animation name.
