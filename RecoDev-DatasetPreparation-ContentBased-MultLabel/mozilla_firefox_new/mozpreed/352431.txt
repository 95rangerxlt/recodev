For the upcoming RC1, we need to bump the version number, check official branding, and make sure all the build infrastructure is pulling the right versions (l10n, AUS, AMO, etc.)

Unless someone else wants to, build/release can take care of the bump + the associated verification to make sure the bump propagates through the build system correctly.

I can take it for now, but if someone else needs to check something/do this, feel free to re-assign.

We should be able to just go ahead and change this whenever you have cycles.

Bump version for rc1

a=mconnor on behalf of drivers for 1.8 branch checkin
Checked in.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060914 BonEcho/2.0 ID:2006091402

rv in UA is still "1.8.1b2".
I just updated to today's nightly builds, and the user-agent looks ok to me:

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060914 BonEcho/2.0

However, the application is still "BonEcho"... do we want to make that "Firefox" yet?  Since the app version is now 2.0 (since we're at rc1), just want to make sure we don't miss anything.

I'll let mconnor confirm, but I think we will want to change this to Firefox when we're code complete, since the release should have Firefox/2.0 at the end of the user agent. I think?

I can whip up a patch for it.
Is this part of official branding switches?  If so we want to only flip it for those...

Looks like it might be. I didn't look closely enough at configure.in.

I'll confirm with :rs.
-enable-official-branding should be all that is needed to change Bon Echo to Firefox, etc. One easy way to check is if the icon isn't the official icon.
Looks like this was fixed after all; reclosing.
