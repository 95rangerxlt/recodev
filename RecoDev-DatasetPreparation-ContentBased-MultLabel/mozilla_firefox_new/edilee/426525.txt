I have not yet been able to find the cause but since around the 01/04 build I've been experiencing auto-complete issues causing the urlbar to be completly disabled.
The following error then appears when anything happens in the urlbar:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component does not have requested interface arg 0 [nsIAutoCompleteController.input]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml :: attachController :: line 271"  data: no]

This might be related(or not) to the following errors that do appear too:
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebNavigation.sessionHistory]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml ::  :: line 644"  data: no]
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml
Line: 650


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Could not reproduce so far as I have not been able to identify when this occurs.
Actual Results:  
URLbar will not accept to load any url anymore.

Expected Results:  
URLbar should continue to work.

Confirming, I see this using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008040204 Minefield/3.0pre. I see a similar issue as described in Comment 0, suddenly I hit enter in the URL bar to submit and it doesn't work. Will try to get a set of STR.
Some additional information:
I have noticed that once the situation occurs, and the urlbar is more or less useless, one thing that *sometimes* fixes it is loading an https page(so that the top display changes to the https look) then browsing back to a normal http page.(Typically opening that bugzilla entry, and then clicking to the normal http link to mozilla.org on top right)
I have not been able to reproduce it everytime but sometimes it works.
Potentially caused by bug 413836?
If so, what about fixing this by catching any error from the attach?
(Though I guess that would not be a solution)
Do you see the problem with this build?

The original patch from bug 413836 was replaced with another fix which shouldn't cause this anymore.
