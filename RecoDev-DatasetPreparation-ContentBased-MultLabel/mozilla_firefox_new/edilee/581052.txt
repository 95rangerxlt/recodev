Also in reorderBasedOnTabOrder, it could be written in one line if it was still needed:

-    var groupTabs = [];
-    for ( var i=0; i<UI.tabBar.el.children.length; i++ ){
-      var tab = UI.tabBar.el.children[i];
-      if (!tab.collapsed)
-        groupTabs.push(tab);
-    }
+    let groupTabs = Array.filter(gBrowser.tabs, function(tab) !tab.collapsed);

cc: raymond re: _getAllTabs not being necessary to write the code to loop and push -> Array.slice()

Just grab gBrowser.tabs to get an array-list of tabs instead of jumping through Tabs[0].raw.parentNode.children hoops.

Great to know Array.slice(). BTW , the method wasn't written by me.
