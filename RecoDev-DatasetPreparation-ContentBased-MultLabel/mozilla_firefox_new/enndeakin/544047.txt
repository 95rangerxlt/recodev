edit: candidate regress bug: Bug 541520 - dragleave fired at successful drop
Now that dragleave does not fire on successful drop, I suspect that the bookmarks code just needs to do what the dragleave listener does on drop as well.
confirmed, places d&d code still needs a cleanup, hope to find some time in near future.
let's see if i can bring back our d&d code in the 20th century.

Ugh there are actually 2 regression here.
This one causes the drop indicator to not disappear, and i've fixed it locally.
The other one is making it not appear. I've reduced the regrange between 9 and 13 of Jan, still working on a better regrange.
the regrange is
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=120667a01fd2&tochange=a43e2f7eda8f

in this range there are a tracemonkey merge and Roc's big rewrite.
Excluding the TM merge (for now) the most plausible bugs are bug 526394 or bug 529670.

attaching current patch to avoid losing work.
i'm actually investigating the other regression, filed as bug 545049.
Created attachment 425985
patch v1.0

afaict, this is working pretty well.

I can't tell this is perfect, we could still move helpers and make code more elegant, but it's out of the scope of this bug and i want to avoid regressions as far as i can.
This is a nice first step killing all nsDragAndDrop dependencies, after some baking time on nightlies we can further improve the code.
PS: the move of nsDragAndDrop from PlacesOverlay.xuk to browser.xul looks correct to me (since Places is no more depending on it while browser.xul depends on it), but actually does not bring real improvements, since it's just a move. So i could avoid that change and just wait to be able to get rid of the inclusion completely.

Notice there is still bug 545049 that is causing the drop indicator to not appear sometimes, but it is due to some kind of layout regression.


Places drop indicators are not dismissed on drop (revise code to get rid of nsDragAndDrop in Places)

Bug 544047 - Remove Places dependency on nsDragAndDrop.js. Use the new drag and drop API everywhere. r=mano
