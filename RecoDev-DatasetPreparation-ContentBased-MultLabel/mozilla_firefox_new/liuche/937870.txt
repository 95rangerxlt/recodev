The prompt for adding a duplicate engine should only be displayed if the caller sets confirm = true. Implementation also doesn't match comment.

Patch: check confirmation for duplicate engine prompt

The !engineToUpdate check needs to stay there, since we allow "duplicate" installs in that case (the comment should probably be updated too).

Looks like http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e9b946da20cb (bug 493051) regressed this, there should be an additional _confirm check before calling promptError.
BTW, while you're fixing search stuff, maybe you're interested in fixing bug 863474? :)

(I imagine it could be useful for Android since it'd let you do a custom prompt.)

Oh, and in the !_confirm case, we need to call onError() instead.
