Triggered by: Bug 748924
Given bug 773397, tracking for FF16's release but not FF15. Also sending over to Artur since he landed the suspected regressing bug.
This file should be loading fine in the current nightly. However, the CJK font doesn't seem to be rendering correctly.
It's not clear if this is a common problem, and PDF.js will ship in 17 or later, so untracking for release.

PDF now loads but vertical text elements display incorrectly (see attached screenshot).

The following urls are other examples of this bug, I think.

http://www.jcp.or.jp/web_download/seisaku/201204_teigen_panf.pdf#page=2
http://www.jsad.or.jp/paralympic/london/pdf/directory.pdf#page=2

Maybe if the PDF has not only vertical characters but also horizntal characters in the same document, it shows the problem.
Fixed in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2686
I confirmed the fix with pdf.js 0.7.283 on Firefox 19(Vista).
Thank you.
further confirm issue fixed in 0.7.355 with traditional chinese vertical text document sample:

I can see japan and taiwan pdf layout use vertical text a lot (especially with long article like novel), would love to see it in stable Firefox sooner than later (Firefox 19.0.2 still have this issue.)
Fixed by bug 848641.
Unfortunately the fix is too big to backport to branches, IMO. So merging to Firefox will not be sooner than Firefox 22.
You can install the latest development version of PDF.js add-on if you can't wait: http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/extensions/firefox/pdf.js.xpi
Usually this is much newer than the Firefox internal version.
This fix does not yet completely resolve the text layer positioning. Even on the test PDF above, text layer is nit position correctly:

http://blogs.adobe.com/CCJKType/files/2012/07/TaroUTR50SortedList112.pdf

Tested using http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/web/viewer.html at 79c3546c924501ba4c9852233cd4638414cdf5ea.

If you select all text or make text be displayed, you can see that latin text on the first page is not displayed correctly.
Furthermore, it fails in same manner (hidden text layer) for PDFs from arXiv: http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.3023.pdf
The latin text problem is a separate issue and tracked by <https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2817>.
Verified as fixed on Firefox 23 Nightly(Build ID: 20130408030928) 
-the page loads correctly
-the text is correctly displayed
