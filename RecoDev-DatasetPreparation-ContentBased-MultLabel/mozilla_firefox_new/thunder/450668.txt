That seems outside the scope of this bug.
those are the two rfe's around bookmarks that were out there. I'll create a seperate bug.
If we can get this one in on time, that'd be great.
Patch coming up, I'll just need a reviewer.

Livemarks support v1

Sorry Gavin, let me know if you're busy I'll find someone else to review...

This patch adds support for livemarks in bookmarks sections (toolbar/menu/folders).  To use it, add an item of type 'livemark', like this:

[BookmarksToolbar]
item.1.title=Queso
item.1.link=http://queso.com/
item.1.description=Quesos deliciosos!
item.2.title=Foo
item.2.siteLink=http://blog.mozilla.com/
item.2.feedLink=http://blog.mozilla.com/feed/
item.2.type=livemark

The above will add a bookmark and a livemark to the toolbar.

Approved for 1.9.0.2. Please land in CVS. a=ss

(Talking with Dan, it looks like this isn't very relevant to get landed on trunk first since it's only used for distributions. He said he'd work on a test though.)
Can't remember if Litmus or automated was better, so take your pick. :)
Landed:

Checking in distribution.js;
/cvsroot/mozilla/browser/components/distribution.js,v  <--  distribution.js
new revision: 1.5; previous revision: 1.4
done

Thanks, Dan. Very much appreciated.
