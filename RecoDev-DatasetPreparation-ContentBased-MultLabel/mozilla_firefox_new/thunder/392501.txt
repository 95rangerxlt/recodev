distribution.ini parser (wip)

First pass at the distribution.ini parser.

Loads [Preferences] and [LocalizablePreferences], but currently hooks into the startup process rather late, so it stomps on extension defaults.

Goes through searchplugins/, but doesn't actually load them yet (bug 392771).

Bookmarks, other UI mods, AUS work not done yet.

Sample distribution.ini (wip)

Sample distribution.ini that I'm working with.

Place into appdir/distribution/ to try out the parser patch.

distribution.ini parser (wip)

Updated to support localized prefs.
Supports adding a string to the about box.  The 'name' setting in the Global section is gone, and replaced with 'about'.

distribution.ini parser (wip)

Latest iteration, requires patch from bug 392967 for prefs to load.

todo:
- bookmarks
- call loadEngines (bug 392771)
- cleanup/refactoring
Created attachment 278847
distribution.ini parser (wip)

* Adds skeleton bookmarks parsing
* Load search engines (depends on patch on bug 392771)
* Do a little refactoring to avoid code duplication

todo:
* finish hooking up bookmarks, make sure they only get added once

Ok, I've added support for bookmarks/separators/folders.  This is (I think) feature-complete now.

distribution.ini parser v1.1

Improve the way we force prefs to be reloaded - now we only force default prefs to be reloaded.

XREExeF is a poor choice. Please use XCurProcD instead (which represents the application directory). See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/xpcom/io/nsDirectoryServiceDefs.h#75

As a general nit, I think it would be preferable to use "let" instead of "var" throughout new code, but do as you see fit. Did you run this with strict warnings enabled? I think there were at least a few cases where you should get "redeclared var" warnings.

>+        var iprop = RegExp.$2;
>+        var ilocale = RegExp.$3;

I think the use of RegExp globals is hard to understand. Can you switch it around to use regexp.exec, like so?

let m = /^item\.(\d+)\.(\w+)\.?(\w*)/.exec(keys[i]);
if (m) {
  let [iid, iprop, ilocale] = m;
  ...
}
else {
  dump("Key did not match: " + keys[i] + "\n");
}

Something's not right here.

I thought you weren't going to do this, per bug 392967 comment 11 and 13.

v1.2 removes the search engine code - working on a patch to load those by changing NS_APP_SEARCH_DIR_LIST instead.

I'm not sure why you need this function. Doesn't array.indexOf(thing) do basically the same thing, and I bet it's better-optimized. 

As discussed on IRC, the install-once bookmarks changes need to be keyed by the distro ID, so that if you install Firefox+A and then Firefox+B, you get the +B bookmarks customizations added in. This can be done in a followup bug.

Totally right.  I'm using array.indexOf(thing) >= 0 now.

I'd rather do it right away... this patch does that.

Also, it fixes a bug getting the match data from the regexp that I introduced in v1.2 of the patch.  Bookmarks now work correctly again.

I'm assuming I can carry over the r+, and requesting approval to get this into m8.
