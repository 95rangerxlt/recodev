The patch

We can now efficiently keep DownloadsViewItemController instances in a Map. Currently there are at most three of them for each Downloads Panel.

The comment saying we must keep track of deleted instances is not true with the new Downloads API anymore.

These changes allow us to remove the dummy download identifiers.
