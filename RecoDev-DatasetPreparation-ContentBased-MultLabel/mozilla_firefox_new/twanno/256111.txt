screenshot were contents exceeds costumization dialog

This is definitly not a theme related bug. I noticed this in the nl-NL
localized 1.0RC1 build (clean profile). The contents of the costumize dialog
exceed the dialog so scrollbars cover part of the contents. And because of bug
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=264489 this appears every time I
open the costumization dialog even after resizing. New Firefox users may get
very confused if they see this. I didn't even know what to do at first (turns
out you have to make the dialog wider to let the hor. scrollbar disappear).
Requesting blocking-aviary1.0 because I think it could keep potential new users
away from firefox. 
BTW The main problem is that scrolling the vert. scrollbar doesn't scroll the
dropdown menus in view (they stay covered by the hor. scrollbar)
BTW 2 I am on windows so maybe this bug should be set to OS:All?

Patch option 1: Add padding to account for scrollbar height

The first of two patches I have created.
This patch adds padding-bottom of 15px to the bottom of the box containing the
elements which become invisible because of the scrollbar. This 15px is a rough
estimate of the scrollbar height. I personally do not like this patch, because
with different themes, the scrollbar heights will be different. Furthermore the
costumization window doesn't look too good with this patch applied (screenshot
comming).

This is my first patch, and I don't know why some (untouched) lines are deleted
and added again in this patch (also in patch option 2). I updated the code on
Windows XP with Turbo Pad, maybe that's causing this. Although I have set line
endings to be Unix like.

patch option 2: Add a box which takes the overflow of the two containing boxes

I like this patch better. The scrolling of the two boxes which had overflow:
auto; style attributes, is applied to one box which now contains both other
boxes.
However, it now appears that the drop-downmenu and the buttons can be dragged
to a toolbar. (screenshot comming).

A better solution for patch option 1.

This patch is like patch option 2, but the box containing the
toolbarpaletteitems has it's own scrolling interface now. This makes the form
elements stay at the bottom of the viewport, as it is now. 
The only disadvantage is that the scrollbar on the right (palette-box) isn't
visible when the costumizeToolbar opens, with the nl-NL localized build.

I will try to find better solutions, although I know that a centralized
position of the toolbar is needed, and therefore the width of the toolbar has
to be predefined :(.

I just wanted to mention that I saw this bug in only one other localized build
except from nl-NL: in the ca-AD build. 
List of localized builds tested: ca-AD, cs-CZ, de-DE, el-GR, en-US, es-ES,
fi-FI, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, nb-NO, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-BR, ro-RO, ru-RU, sl-SI, sv-SE.

Final patch setting the overflow to hidden, so no scrollbar appears.

This patch sets the overflow style property to hidden in the box containing the
form elements. This prevents a scrollbar from appearing so the form elements
remain visible. On the nl-NL localized build the last button is partly visible,
but a user will know that to make the button completely visible he has to widen
the window. (The nl-NL build has the widest 'form-elements-box' seen so far, so
the worst effect will be seen in this build and it is not even worse at all;
Screenshot comming).

Nian Liu, can you change the OS to All?

Nevermind the patches this bug is clearly a duplicate of bug #171454. And the
patch I created was used to fix that bug.

Bens, can you guys look at this patch? It looks like localizations and people
using large fonts might be pretty hosed here. I don't consider this a blocker,
but there is a simple patch so I'm just looking for app developer opinion here.
