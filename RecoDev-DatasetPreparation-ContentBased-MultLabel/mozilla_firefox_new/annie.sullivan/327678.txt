Dragging and dropping onto the places toolbar from urls on webpages or the urlbar works fine on Mac until the user tries to drag/drop a toolbarbutton to another location on the toolbar, and then drag and drop stops working entirely.  Mac-only bug.

Dragging and dropping onto the places toolbar from urls on webpages or the urlbar works fine on Mac until the user tries to drag/drop a toolbarbutton to another location on the toolbar, and then drag and drop stops working entirely.  Mac-only bug.
This was caused by a problem with the transferable system converting "\r\n" to "\n\n" on mac and "\n" on linux/windows, which confused our unwrapNode() function.  The fix was checked in with the fix to bug 327036.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
