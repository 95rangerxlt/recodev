The idea of the MVC approach is that every view is generic. For expediency, I have erroneously initialized the toolbar from the toolbarRoot in Bookmarks in the toolbar's init: method:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/places/content/toolbar.xml#72

This should _not_ be done like this, since this prevents view reusability. The toolbar (and menu) need to have a place="" attribute which takes a place: URI. They then need to init from this.

This is probably worth an ASSERT then...

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
