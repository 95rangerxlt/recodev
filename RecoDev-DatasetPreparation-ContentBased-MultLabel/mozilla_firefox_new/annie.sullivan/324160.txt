In the click menu for the menu view, it sets the activeView only if the target was a menuitem.  If the target was a sub-menu, the activeView still needs to be set.

Set activeView for submenus

Not sure if I should also check if the submenu is a childNode?  I tested this and and it only seems to set the activeView when childNodes are clicked.

Set activeView for submenus

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
