Screen shot of the lack of highlighting

As well as not showing a highlight colour when mousing over one of the icons, the currently selected one isn't highlighted either.  (In the screenshot, the selected icon is "Media", and my mouse pointer was over the "Permissions" icon.)
This is a regression from Firefox 3.6.6.
Could anyone please add "regression" (with no quotes) to keywords? Can't do that myself.
I don't know how we broke it, but I will see if I can find out.
We're missing "#viewGroup > radio[selected="true"]" in our css file, which extensions.css had, but it was removed by Bug 560602 in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2dcd870f9e31.

I'll try to fix this as quickly as possible.
Is this a problem on any other OS than windows?

Patch v. 1.0

This should fix it on the Windows theme, but if it is broken on other OSes, we will need to fix their skins, too.

Hi all, I confirm it's a problem only for the windows themes. I've checked also Mac Snow Leopard(32-b) and Ubuntu 10.04(64-b).

Patch v. 1.1

I was going to say this doesn't need another review, but here's another nit:

> #viewGroup > radio {
>   list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/pageInfo.png");
>   -moz-box-orient: vertical;
>   -moz-box-align: center;
>   -moz-appearance: none;
>   padding: 5px 3px 1px 3px;
>+  margin: 0px 1px;

Fixed and ready for landing.
I can reproduce this bug on Mac OS.

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:2.0b1) Gecko/20100630 Firefox/4.0b1
I am filing a separate bug for the Mac issue, since I don't have a Mac development environment; I can generate patches, but I can't test them (that I'm aware).  So I am limiting this bug to Windows Page Info issues regressed by the removal of the old extensions manager.
I have filed Bug 576586 for Mac css issues.
