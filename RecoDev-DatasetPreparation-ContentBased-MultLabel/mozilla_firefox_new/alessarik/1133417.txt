To resolve this issue we should change expectation of "web-platform-test" suite.
That expectations are situated in .\testing\web-platform\meta\pointerevents folder.

r+ (looks like wpt are run only on desktop)
If there are no objections, I will put checkin-needed flag...
...at the same time as bug 1166347 will be checkined too.
So why are these failing? The `prefs: [dom.w3c_pointer_events.enabled:true]` line should make sure that the default pref change shouldn't affect them. Should we add layout.css.touch_action.enabled there?
