Class InkCollector helps fire POINTER_LEAVE event for PEN device in some case.

Current implementation:
Activation of InkCollecor class needs that PEN device will be touched
(In this case MOUSE_DOWN will be fired).

Should it behavior be changed for detect just first PEN event?
(For example MOUSE_MOVE, not only MOUSE_DOWN)

Could You please notify your opinion about changing such behavior?
Yes, this should be fixed.  We should dispatch a pointerleave event whenever a pen moves out of the hit test boundaries of an element and its descendants, whether the pen is down or not.

Related to this, the spec also says "User agents MUST also fire a pointer event named pointerleave when a pen stylus leaves hover range detectable by the digitizer."
