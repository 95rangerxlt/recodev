This test fails and/or asserts, needs a re-factor. For one, it can probably only use 1 additional tab, as I do not see the benefit of using 3.

So the test should be: open 2 tabs, log and check output.
open a new window with 1 tab, log and check output, close window, log more messages and check output.

proposed fix

Proposed fix.

Please note that there's a small fix for head.js to not close the last tab, when the test that just executed already does that. The browser_webconsole_bug_595350_multiple_windows_and_tabs.js test file needs to close the tabs it opens to check after that the state of the HUDService. If head.js closes the last tab, then the last window also closes, which breaks all other tests. So, the simple fix is to close all tabs, except the last one. No regressions are caused by this small change.

proposed fix

nice catch in head.js
I can push this without review as it is a test change. Let me do some testing first.
Adding checkin-needed, given it's only a test change.

Looks like you can remove this test from the comment at the end of head.js as well.

The other head.js change makes me wonder what the effect these console tests have on the state of the browser during the test run. Not related to this bug in any way, but it'd be an interesting experiment to write code that logs of event listeners added/nodes in document/etc. to see how the browser's state changes during mochitest/browserchrome/etc. test runs.
