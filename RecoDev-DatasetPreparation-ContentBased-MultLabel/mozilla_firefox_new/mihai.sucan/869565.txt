The exception text looks like this:

[13:58:59.291] [Exception... "'Error: haha' when calling method: [nsIFactory::createInstance]"  nsresult: "0x8057001c (NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_JS_OBJECT)"  location: "native frame :: <unknown filename> :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 0"  data: no]

Not sure what the object looks like....

When I click it in the browser console, I get:

[13:59:02.646] ReferenceError: reference to undefined property selectedItem.url @
chrome://browser/content/devtools/webconsole.js:4425

Thanks for the report.

To make sure I understand correctly, the bug is about the ReferenceError that shows when an XPConnect error is logged? I'll fix this ASAP.

That's correct; the exception thrown by webconsole.js itself.
Harmless error related to the undefined property. Will fix this.
