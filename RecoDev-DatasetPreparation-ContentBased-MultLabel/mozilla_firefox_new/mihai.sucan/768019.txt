How do you reproduce the bug?

I tried this and I only see one CSS warning in the Web Console and in the Error Console.
STR:
- open test.html in a new tab
- switch to the tab
- wait until the page is loaded
- open the web console

Actual Result:
- JS warning "unknown property"
Ah, so I have to open the Web Console after the error happens.

Thanks for the STR. I was able to reproduce now. I have a hunch what's causing this. Will look into fixing it ASAP.

This fixes the problem for me. It is an embarrassingly simple fix: I passed the wrong argument to the function that determines the cached message category.

Thanks for your report!
Thanks for the r+!
