Often I will want to check for the presence or value of attributes on an element. To do this, I expand the attributes property of the element, and then I have a 0-based array that I then have to expand each node of to find the attribute that I am looking for.

It would be a lot nicer if we included a snippet of the attribute name + value (as much as will fit) next to the attribute index, since right now the index is quite useless for most people.

We now show attrName="value" for DOM attribute nodes.


Element attributes should show a snippet of the attribute name + value without having to expand the attribute member
