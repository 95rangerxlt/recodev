document.title returns a getter and completion suggestions are inaccurate. We need to execute safe/native getters.
Regression caused by bug 842682. We have a test that was supposed to check this stuff, browser_webconsole_bug_651501_document_body_autocomplete.js. However, it changed too much in time and now it's too permissive - it doesn't check which properties are shown in the popup.

Patch started as a bit of code shuffle in JSPropertyProvider - it grew too confusing / easy to break. Then I found the problem with executing native getters - see DebuggerObjectSupport.getProperty().

Any improvements we could make?

In the future, it would be nice if we could reuse stuff from actors/script.js. I saw we have functions there for similar purposes.

Looks fine to me, but it would be better to add an explicit test for document.title or a similar getter.

Maybe we should move the hasSafeGetter() and getProperty() helper functions from script.js to DevToolsUtils.js and reuse them here, but it's up to you.

Thanks for the review!

Updated the patch to move getProperty() and hasSafeGetter() as suggested. Also added testing for document.title.

Do note that I fixed two issues in getProperty(): (1) it called native getter functions on prototype objects, not on the root/start object, which made it fail in many cases; (2) when it executed a native getter it returned a debugger completion value, not the actual function return value - breaking its callers. I found these problems when working on bug 843004.
