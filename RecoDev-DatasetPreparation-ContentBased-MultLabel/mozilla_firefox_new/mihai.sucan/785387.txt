I'll boot to Mac to test this.

Can you please let me know: does this happen with a clean profile? do you have any custom fonts? (what fonts are used for autocomplete? if you can look at this with the DOM Inspector tool) do you have a custom font-size or is this only with the default font-size in the web console?

Please play with cmd--, cmd-+ and cmd-0 to see if you notice any pattern. From memory: it's possible that only with the default font size (after cmd-0) you *could* get a mismatch.

Thank you!
I just tried with a new, clean profile and I could reproduce the problem immediately. The text zoom on the web console did not seem to make any difference in this behavior.

This fixes the problem on my Mac.

Thank you Kevin for the bug report.

Is this fine on Windows?
