Right now form data is always transferred as is, as json.  The attached patch lets actors specify a protocol.js type that will be used to marshal the form after it is returned from the actor, and before it is handed to the front's form method.

This patch moves a call to manage(), and jryans recently touched manage(), so I'm asking jryans for review.

Could we check if |desc.value| is in |registeredTypes| instead of having to set |_isType|?

Nit: trailing whitespace
I guess this bug is a dupe of bug 1072080 then?

LGTM if try passes -- the stop listening to node demises was handled in a previous patch and backed out, so good to see this back.
