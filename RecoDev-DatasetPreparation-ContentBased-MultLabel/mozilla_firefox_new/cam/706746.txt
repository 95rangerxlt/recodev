The handler for the button on the "Leaving this page will close the Inspector and the changes you have made will be lost." notification bar needs to return true if it causes the notification bar to disappear, which it does by calling closeInspectorUI().

You probably want "return false;" at the end, to prevent the "function onButtonLeave does not always return a value" warning.
I don't get that warning when running the test, but I will include it for clarity.
