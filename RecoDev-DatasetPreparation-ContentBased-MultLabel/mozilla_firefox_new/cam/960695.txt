LGTM. Please check the event target, so it doesn't change the focus when you click on anchors. Thanks!

Added the check for anchors. Not 100% happy with it but probably good enough. The first check for links appears to only really matter for network requests which open the network popup. I'd consider removing that check altogether and focusing the input line there too, but ...

Also added a test.
what did my editor do to the indenting in that test file? I don't even...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Patch looks good. r+ with the following fixes:

Got an exception playing around:

System JS : ERROR resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> file:///home/mihai/src/mozilla/fx-team/browser/devtools//webconsole/webconsole.js:578 - TypeError: e.target.tagName is undefined

tagName is not available for all node types.


Also please fix indentation. :) Thank you!

Does it focus the input on any button click? Maybe you should check that e.button == 0 (left mouse button).
