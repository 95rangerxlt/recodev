0006-Bug-XXXXXXX-fix-legacy-sync-password-and-passphrase-.patch

With legacy sync configured, go to incontent sync prefs and select the options "My recovery key" or "change password".

Expected: you can view your recovery key or change your password.
Actual: Noting happens and console reports "JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/sync/utils.js, line 69: TypeError: this.openChange is not a function"

Introduced via bug 1016300 and fixed by the attached patch.  I could have used .bind() but thought an inline function slightly cleaner.

Setting qeverify- as I think we can verify this manually while working on sync migration.

Sounds like this needs to hit Firefox 34/35, right? Can you get the approval requests in ASAP.
Oh, nevermind - in-content prefs only.

Though actually we probably should get this on Aurora given that bug 1072181 enables in-content prefs there.
