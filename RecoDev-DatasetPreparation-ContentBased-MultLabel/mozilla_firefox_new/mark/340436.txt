Ugh.  The real problem is the first assertion, and what we really want to see is that stack.  339371 is causing exceptions to be ignored.

Real crash log

I backed out the patch from bug 339371 locally to let the exception raise SIGTRAP and give a crash log.

mParentView is a non-ChildView (doesn't implement mozView)?

Patch

There's really no reason to get the window from the parent view, we might as well just take what's already available in the disappearing scrollbar view, if anything.  If there's nothing there, it's not likely that the parent view will have a window anyway.
