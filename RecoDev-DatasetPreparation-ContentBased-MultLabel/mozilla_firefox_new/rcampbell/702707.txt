At least on Mac, when going to windowed mode, if I use the keyboard shortcut to close it (mac-shift-K) the console remains and then is completely unresponsive until I quit Firefox.

STR:
1. Type mac shift K
2. Change position -> window
3. Type mac shift K

Expected:
1. Window should close
2. Window becomes zombie-like

zombie killer

needs a test still, this could use a little round of feedback though.
also worth noting that the titlebar on the panel appears to be stealing focus. If you drag the panel to a new position and hit Cmd-K, nothing happens. This is surprising. If you focus the text area in (or any other browser widget) the toggle method gets fired. Probably another focus-related panel bug.

I think this'll help. Based on feedback from mihai in IRC.

I am not sure if this is going to fix the memleak. Maybe go for a try push?
Great work so far Rob :D
No, I haven't forgotten about this. Thanks.

canceling review for one more little fix. Need to remove the consolePanel reference and node in positionConsole: to account for repositioning.

Probably we can revive all this now, just by changing from popuphidden to popuphiding.

(this would also probably save us from commenting-out parts of browser_webconsole_position_ui.js)

Why this change here? This is the only one that doesn't seem to make sense for me. The web console won't close, it will only hide itself...
hidePopup() calls deactivateHUDForContext if necessary.

nope.

also, nope.

I think we're going to be better off landing this as-is. Further mucking around with the preferences setting in a panel that's being torn down isn't going to work.

Ah, ugly. We will switch some day to a real xul:window and no longer rely on the panel, anyway.

the return of the zombie killer

I'd like to get this into aurora. This fixes a critical bug where a user can end up with a zombie panel on their screen on OS X computers. It is impossible to close this panel without resorting to deep JavaScript juju.

Risk is relatively low-risk, has been tested on all platforms and comes with its own test.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/12211a96deaa
I have tried using the steps from the description on:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0 beta 2
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0 beta 2

The window is closing as expected on both OSes.

Setting resolution to Verified Fixed on Beta.
