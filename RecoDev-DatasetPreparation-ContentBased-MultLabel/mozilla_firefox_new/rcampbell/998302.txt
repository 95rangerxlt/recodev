I don't see how the test touches www.mozilla.org, but perhaps somebody more familiar with the devtools will be able to see how that happens.

The test opens a tab to about:credits, which seems to load mozilla.org. This test can be changed to load any other chrome page.
I wouldn't really consider about:credits as "chrome page" - it doesn't have chrome privileges, and is HTML loaded via https://. What does the test care about?
Mihai, are you able to look at this/figure out what Gavin is asking about in comment 2?  This is one of the last tests blocking bug 995417.

browser/devtools/webconsole/test/browser_webconsole_chrome.js attempts to connect to www.mozilla.org



Bug 998302 - Connect to about:config instead of about:credits to avoid accessing mozilla.org when the test runs. r=robcee
