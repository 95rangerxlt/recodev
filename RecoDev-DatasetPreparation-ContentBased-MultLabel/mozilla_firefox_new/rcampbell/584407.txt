*** Bug 587743 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
each one of these features is going to be a feature of its own. We'll need to at least stub this menu to get strings. Taking this for b5.
Rob has a mostly-there patch for this now. If this is going to make it, we'll need to try to get it in beta 6 because of the strings.
Is this still in for B6? If so, can we at least see a WIP patch here? Looks like this is hard to even triage in this state.
I'm scaling back on some of the features in the menu. I think we can safely go for:

very WIP, bitrotted. Just putting here to get some l10n eyeballs on it. Hoping to get back to this patch this weekend to finish it up.

Can't see anything bad from here.
Inspector feature postponed. Removing blocking flags from Inspector bugs.
Removing items from kd4b6.
clearing priority flag as this feature was dropped from fx4.

HTML Menu

here's a version that successfully deletes what it's supposed to. Adding a test now.

One thing I'm wondering if invalidateHierarchy() in breadcrumbs is the best way to deal with this. Seems to work fine, but I tried using cutAfter without success. Let me know what you think.

Looks good. r- for the moment, but mostly nits.

This might be extended later for pseudo-classes/elements, so it's not HTML-specific.

If we agree that this menu can be reused somewhere else (infobar), remove "Called via the HTML panel's context menu".

I think this should work:
this.breadcrumbs.invalidateHierarchy();
this.breadcrumbs.udpate();

Don't use cutAfter. This will make things a little more complicated, it's not worth it.
totally non-qref'd patch. Will update...

This was not the right patch. I posted a previous version. Sorry about that.

yes, they're commented in the real version. Honest! :(

Ah, good. And yes, there's no reason we can't reuse it for... stuff.

What I ended up doing was reordering the sequence here. By calling invalidateHierarchy then inspectNode, all seems to work and should cut down on duplication of breadcrumbs calling.

Why is this in browser.xul rather than inspector.html?

We will need this menu in other parts of the inspector: infobar (bug 717916) and breadcrumbs (bug 724600).
I guess we should remove those empty commandkey entries.

+<!ENTITY inspectorHTMLCopyInner.label       "Copy Inner HTML">

I'm going to remove the commandkey strings.

Paul, can you give the browser.xul, browser-sets.inc and browser.dtd bits a quick once-over (with the above removal in mind)? Thanks!

Nit: the rest of these split the oncommand on to a new line, so for consistency's sake, let's do that here.

This id stood out as "wrong" to me but there isn't a great deal of consistency within browser.xul about ids for context menus, so follow your heart here.
