Really good work. I have a few nit picks, but r+!

Your highlighter.css changes also need to be made in pinstripe and winstripe.

I am taking this patch into the main highlighter patch. It's surgical in its changes, very clean and straight-forward. Thank you!

(I applied all the nits my self, so I was able to test the patch. So no need for an update.)

The other empty divs are marked as <div /> but this one is <div></div>.

Indentation is not consistent, and it should be two spaces.

Indentation needs to follow the same level as in the rest of the file: two spaces.

I'd say 0.2s is too slow. I am going for 0.1s.

Each property needs to be on its own line.
