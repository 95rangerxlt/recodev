Fix localization typos

Fixed a typo in the GCLI properties file and replaced ... with their Unicode counterparts (â€¦) since someone mentioned that in the original bug.

Its 10PM and seems like ./mach build decided to clobber itself after the recent push so I'm not going to run tests. Pushing to try and will check back in the morning: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=7cceb3e244a3

Should this have a period?

No other strings have periods, so no?
