How to reproduce:

 * Open Scratchpad
 * Load a new file
 * Change its contents
 * Try closing Scratchpad by clicking on X (not a menu item)

Expected result: a dialog asking you to save changes.
Actual result: Scratchpad closes and your changes are lost.

Removed all _skipClosePrompt instances and added a regression test

Heather (correctly) noticed that we don't need _skipClosePrompt at all since window.close doesn't trigger a "close" event. I tested manually and run all Scratchpad tests (on Ubuntu).

Updated patch to prevent potential race condition when testing |Scratchpad.onClose|. This method now accepts an optional callback, just like |Scratchpad.close|.

Try build for this patch: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=f5a74664ba5f (no related oranges).
