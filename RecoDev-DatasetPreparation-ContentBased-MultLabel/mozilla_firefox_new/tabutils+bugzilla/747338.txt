For bug 675539 we need to know when a tab was last selected (or visible).

Not sure if we need a setter for this? If session store is going to store this value (like in bug 739866) we might need to do that.

Having both lastAccessed and lastSelected with different meanings is confusing. If the former isn't what we need, we should fix that.

The former isn't what *I* need, but I agree that both are very (or too) similar. Not sure if bug 586067 could use lastSelected, too.

Yes. The point is to sort tabs in most-recently-used order.
“Set last-accessed timestamp when deselecting tabs rather than when selecting them”

I would rather say : both.

In case of crash, it's good to know that the current tab was accessed. The current tab had been selected, but not yet deselected.
So the only reason this didn't land is because a minor naming concern?

Can we change to lastVisible and land?

Seems problematic in preview mode. We may set the time stamp on selected tab to Infinity.
