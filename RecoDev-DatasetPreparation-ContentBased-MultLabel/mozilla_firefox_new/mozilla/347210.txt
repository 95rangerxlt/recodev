In using the bookmarks service with the CCK, there is no easy way to add separators given an RDF resource.

Just the code

I'll also need to do something with the uid and create another file I think?

If CreateSeparator succeeds but InsertResource fails, you'll end up leaking (or potentially leaking) aResult.

Interesting. I copied the code from elsewhere in the file:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/bookmarks/src/nsBookmarksService.cpp#2943

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/bookmarks/src/nsBookmarksService.cpp#2828

So that bug exists elsewhere as well.

Would I just NS_RELEASE on the RDFResource?

New patch

This patch releases upon failure, and fixes the other places in this file that have that problem as well.

New patch

This is a branch only patch that adds a new interface that allows the CCK to create separators. 

Needed for some of the custom builds that are being done by MoCo.

a=drivers, please land on the branch.
Seems like you should at least get the leak fixes into the trunk, if not the whole thing.
This will definitely go on the trunk as well in a little different incarnation.
Possible regression:  BeOS branch build broke sometime between 2006-07-30 and today.
Updated from CVS again - just picked up revised patch and can build now.  Apologies for bug-chatter.
This code is not in the trunk anymore, so this was 1.8 only.


nsIBookmarksService needs createSeparatorInContainer
