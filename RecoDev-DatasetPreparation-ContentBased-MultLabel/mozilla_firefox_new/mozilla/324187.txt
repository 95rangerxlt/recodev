Edit -> Preferences | Tools -> Options -> Content -> Warn me [Exceptions]. Remove all and close, reopen Exceptions and scheme:http appears.

I'm able to reliably reproduce this on a new profile, but it doesn't seem to be working on my regular profile.

Had this in my regular profile for a bit. Removing the http entry just makes it reappear again when you reopen the exceptions list.

make sure host has a length before processing with ioService.newURI()
So hostList is empty because the pref is blank, right? Why not just:

if (!hosts)
  continue;

after the try/catch?

I'm not sure why these prefs exist and are blank though... which one is blank in this case?

what if hosts = ,,,,?

I'd guess xpinstall.blacklist.add as this pref is unset in a new profile.

you could if(!hosts), but I'd still if(!host.length) later

Why would that ever happen?
Those three preferences are just used to add new values to the permissions. After each has been read, they are reset to a blank string.

So the blank prefs are xpinstall.whitelist.add and xpinstall.whitelist.add.103 since they have initial values. The first time the exceptions dialog is opened they are cleared. Unset prefs don't matter since they throw when they are retrieved.

What I haven't spotted yet is why you don't get a new scheme:http every single time you open the exceptions. Possibly this is something the permissions manager is protecting us from?

It shouldn't unless someone's screwing around with the pref, but why not check anyway?

195     if (this._type == "install") {
196       var enumerator = this._pm.enumerator;
197       if (!enumerator.hasMoreElements())
198         this._updatePermissions();
199     }

_updatePermissions() only runs if the list is empty, which it won't be if you've already got something in the permission manager. With the defaults, update and addons are added to the list once you close the window and the prefs are set to ''. When the list is cleared, the whitelist.add(.103) prefs are still '', so the next time it runs the empty pref values are processed. Sound right?
Yeah that's it.

Personally I think that anyone mucking around with the prefs themselves deserves everything they get but that's just me.

Logan, its usually best to provide patches from the trunk source, your line offsets are way off which I think in this case means you've patched off the processed file. I don't think it actually makes much difference here, just for future reference.

Because it makes the code less clear on what it's really checking to handle a case that should never conceivably happen. If someone files a bug saying "the whitelist dialog breaks when I set pref y to random value x", you can mark it invalid ;).

uber-nit (please don't kill me): space before the paren. Can be fixed on checkin.

This may no longer be 1.5 material, but it looks as awful as ever. How about getting this on 1.8 branch for added polish?
mozilla/browser/components/preferences/permissions.js 	1.8
mozilla/browser/components/preferences/permissions.js 	1.6.4.2


scheme:http appears in software installation whitelist if no other sites exist

fixed1.8.1
