Build ID: 20140512231802

Steps to reproduce:

we should remove the aFileExt argument, it is only used in a couple places with "json", that is the default btw (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=getMostRecentBackup)

let's just hardcode "json" in the Regexp, doesn't make sense to have a var for just a single use.

When you changed this from a variable to a fixed regexp you missed the chance to change it to a literal, which would have fixed the bug introduced by bug 852032.
