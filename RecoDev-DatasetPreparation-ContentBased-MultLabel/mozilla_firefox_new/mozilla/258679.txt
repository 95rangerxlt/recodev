The search field on the toolbar (google) no longer resizes to a reasonable size
when the browser window changes, and it is not possible to modify the size in
userChrome.css.

This is a regression in today's build (20040909).

Previously the search field resized nicely.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
Actual Results:  
Search field very small, only fits two words.

Expected Results:  
Search field around 25% of browser width.

It's not possible to modify this with the following setting in userChrome either:

#search-container {
-moz-box-flex: 400 !important;
}

see bug 258343 comment 3 and comment 8, though I haven't seen a post on mz yet.
I did some digging and found this solution, not sure if its necessarily the best
way to do it, but it seems to work for most people.

/* Make the Search box flex wider */
#search-container {
   -moz-box-flex: 200 !important;
}

#searchbar {
   -moz-box-flex: 200 !important;
}

This could also probably be fixed (i.e. reverted to the previous behaviour) by
adding a flex="1" attribute onto the searchbar element in the chrome. I've only
tested it using the dom inspector to add the attribute and am not really up to
the task of making a patch for this, perhaps someone else could oblige?
Likely caused by the following checkin:

Is this still apparent on the latest nightlies?
This problem is still apparent in 1.0PR.
isn't this bug invalid?
the default themes use a constant size for the searchbar.
I guess the themes should be updated, by looking at searchbar.css and by
removing searchbar references in browser.css
I wouldn't think that it is invalid because we have allowed resizing the search
bar since at least Phoenix 0.5.  Also, in many cases, the search bar is too
small to display long queries.  Also, for people who have moved the location bar
to another toolbar, expanding the search bar is a good use of the added space on
the toolbar.

Flexibility was the whole point of being able to customize the toolbars in the
first place.  We shouldn't make it less flexible.

Also, the location bar expands to occupy whatever free space is available on its
toolbar, so the search bar should at least have the possibility to expand, even
if only via userChrome.css.

The circled region and the dot show where a resize control should be located

I created the image to emphasize what I think 
is the problem here.  There's no "resize control"
present, as is in Safari.  Without it, entering
long search strings is error-prone and tedious.
IMHO, this bug is a DUPLICATE of bug 205011.
Since we already have the adjusted information for the userChrome.css file to
allow resizing of the search bar are people wanting the ability to resize on the
fly built in.

Like what that extension provides. In which case this bug should be marked as an
enhancement bug.

The bug's intention is to point out that a previous feature no longer works. 
The bar used to resize to a percentage of the browser width; now it doesn't do
it anymore (without editing userChrome.css).

> IMHO, this bug is a DUPLICATE of bug 205011.

It isn't, though that bug is still worthwhile it isn't connected to this one. 
This one concerns whether the width of the search bar will be determined as a
percentage of the browser width and therefore resize accoding to the size of the
browser window, or if it is a fixed size and only the location bar should
resize.  For a short time during aviary development, it was the former and I
think it was better that way.

Here's what you need to add to userChrome.css to reproduce that behaviour now:

#search-container {
   -moz-box-flex: 20% !important;
}

#searchbar {
   -moz-box-flex: 20% !important;
}

invisible locationbar is dangerous, if it is a phishing/scam site, I think.
what do you think?

Thanks for pointing that out--though since the window-shrinking behavior is basically the same as Firefox 1.5's, I don't think it's entirely relevant to this discussion.  If you're still concerned, please open a new bug on the subject.

Marking this resolved, since it's now landed on branch & trunk.

Pal, you'll be able to set it to whatever size you want once 205011 lands.
