In FF 0.9 the downloads all go to the installation dir (or MOZILLA_HOME if
defined). Instead, when selecting "Desktop" in the Download section of the
Preferences dialog, they should go there on OS/2, too.

I already tried changing this with this small patch (similar to what other
platforms do in the code after the FF 0.9 release):

But this only gives "Error: doEnabling is not defined" on the JS console and the

Need to change nsHelperAppDlg.js as well.

I'll attach a patch for this and check it in .

Add XP_OS2 paths to download code
Fix checked into the aviary branch and trunk
Yes, this fixes the prefs part of the problem. But now that this works, one can
see that the "Desktop" button in the Download Manager still opens the Firefox dir.
I tried to understand the problem, but I just don't find my way through the
snarl of JS code at this level. The problematic function seems to be
onDownloadShowFolder() in toolkit/mozapps/downloads/content/downloads.js, but I
didn't find out where the "Home" dir comes into play again here.
The open button can't ever open the desktop because the desktop is already open.

There is no clever way on OS/2 to do a second open of the desktop.

But you are correct. This is yet another file that needs the #ifdef XP_OS2 that
I did for these files.
I checked in the downloads.js fix.

It was only needed on aviary and the trunk, since the change Ben made wasn't in 0.9.

Hopefully this is fixed now.

Please try again. Thanks!
Yes, to me this looks fixed now.


"Desktop" selection in download prefs should really download to desktop
