Unable to add a new livemark folder to the toolbar

This regression appears to have been caused by my patch for bug 251491.

This exception results:

JavaScript error: , line 0: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component
returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)
[nsIAnnotationService.getAnnotationString]"  nsresult: "0x80040111

Unable to reproduce this in a fresh profile.  Must have been something a little wonky in the profile I was working with.  Probably still worth catching the exception and doing something sensible if the folder has no URI annotation.
What's going on here is that the toolbar code isn't dealing with the case in which the live bookmark has no site URI (which is legal).  I've got a fix for this (don't show the menu item in that case), which I plan to land as part of 330063.
I believe this was fixed by my patch on 330063.
Reopening because I had to roll back 330063 due to increased RLk and A on branch balsa.
I re-landed 330063 the other day but forgot to re-resolve this one.  Should be fixed now.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
