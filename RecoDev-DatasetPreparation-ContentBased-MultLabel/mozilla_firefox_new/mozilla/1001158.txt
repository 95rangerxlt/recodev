IF you have an invalid distribution.ini, you get a createINIParser error in distirbution.js at line 35 and then things break horribly.

The primarily side effect that is that the distribution-customization-complete message never arrives, but enough stuff happens in distribution.ini that default prefs are overwritten causing bug 947838.

And invalid distribution.ini should be handled more gracefully.

It's only if the distribution.ini is 0 length.

There are two issues here.

1. distribution.js isn't handling the failed createINIParser.

2. Throughout the file, it uses this check:

if (!this._iniFile)
  return this._checkCustomizationComplete();

but then the code accesses _ini::

let sections = enumToObject(this._ini.getSections());

Just because we have the physical file, doesn't mean we have a valid ini. The checks should be against _ini, not _iniFile

Mike, would you be able to work this comment into a patch?

Heck yeah. That's my plan :)

Shouldn't the try...catch do some error reporting to help people figure out why their customizations are busted?
> Shouldn't the try...catch do some error reporting to help people figure out why their customizations are busted?

Yeah, that file ignores a lot of errors. I'll add a reportError.

Another question that will probably get asked is why I check both _iniFile and _ini.

If _iniFile doesn't exist, there's no need to check _ini. If I check _ini alone, it will try to create the parser.

I guess I could make the code smarter and do nothing if there is no _iniFile...

OK, new patch that reports errors and makes the original change I suggested to use _ini instead of _iniFile
Gijs: would you mind reviewing this? Not sure if Shane was the right person.

I'm not sure this code is even owned anymore.
I'll get back to this later today.

I just realized I accidentally checked in an AutoConfig only fix in this in this patch as well. (I honestly have no idea how, since it wasn't in the patch I pushed to MozReview, and that's what should have been pushed).

The fix was for:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1152512

Should I back it out? Or put the patch in 1152512 and get review? (It was a simple fix to have AutoConfig use the latest Javascript)

Request review in the other bug on the double, I guess. It's landed in 41, so it's on aurora now, and if it needs backing out for some reason, we should be doing it soon...
