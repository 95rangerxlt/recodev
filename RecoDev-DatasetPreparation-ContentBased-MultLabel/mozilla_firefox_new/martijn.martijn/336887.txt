The magnifying glass Go button for the search bar is nearly half the width of the entire field. It actually truncates "Google Search" it's so large. It needs a shrinking.

I'm using the default Winstripe theme.

My capture did not copy right... 
The search box and new go/drop arrow are normal here and I see all the text.

In safe mode, it looks OK to me as well. However, if I just manually disable all of my extensions and restart, it is still wide like the screenshot I posted.

Also, in the "Customize Toolbar" window, it appears properly. It's only when it's actually on the toolbar that it's broken.

Gavin, any idea as to what's going on?
Anything relevant in your userChrome.css ?
Looks like it is intended here, but why not reverting to the previous behaviour and then including Pike's Search Button?

I have the same issue, I don't have anything relevant in my userChrome.css.
With the dom inspector, it seems like this rule is responsible for it:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css#221
When I remove that css rule, the ridiculous width is gone.

The weird icon is coming from this:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/searchbar.css#26
Removing that doesn't help, because I don't have an search icon at all after that.
Oops! Apparently, the weird icon is intended.

As Stated in My Bug, It's when Toolbar Buttons are set to show both icons and text that this bug happens.

This fixes the bug. I don't see any regressions from this, so it seems it can safely be removed.
