We are trying to convert all imports to require() and the devtools loader already provides a require("promise") that can be used here.

Since this is a new method and the file is already inconsistent, let's avoid using the deprecated "aFoo" style for arguments and use the simpler "foo".

Since this is now in toolkit, better use DevToolsUtils.reportException(), like we do elsewhere in this file, so that other embeddings can work properly.
