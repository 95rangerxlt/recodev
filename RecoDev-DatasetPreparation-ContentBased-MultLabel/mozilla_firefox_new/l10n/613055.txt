Landed the batch I have so far, http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4273e6a3cd49.

Leaving open tentatively.
Marking this FIXED for tonight, just in case we'd land the remaining blockers.

Heads up for the build engineer of b8, there's going to be a pending sign-off for `ast`, that localizer just hits buttons too eagerly to clean up, that's fine to ignore. One of the reason I'm working on bug 565358 now.
