bug 458014 made some significant changes to l10n repack code. During 3.1b2 I discovered that this has completely broken MAR generation for l10n builds.

We generate MARs as follows:
make -C tools/update-packaging full-update DIST=`pwd`/dist/l10n-stage AB_CD=whatever MOZ_PKG_PRETTYNAMES=1

This will still generate a valid MAR but it will be missing a bunch of files, as our update_verify test found out:
calling QuitProgressUI
Only in target/Firefox/chrome: be.jar
Only in target/Firefox/chrome: be.manifest
Only in target/Firefox/defaults/pref: firefox-l10n.js

This is blocking Firefox 3.1b2.

call into mar for MOZ_MAKE_MARS, set the appropriate paths

Tested this with:

unbranded nightly build

branded official 3.1 b2 build 1

en-US bits on OS/X.

The good news is, once I had the initial paths worked out, it worked out of the box for the official builds, too.

I removed the comment about the mars needing the repackage-zip target, as I apparently broke that. Sorry for that. But I think that having the mars being part of this makefiles is a good thing, even if the timing is bad as can be.

Testing this out now. I don't know that passing PACKAGE_BASE_DIR will do anything - tools/update-packaging/Makefile.in doesn't seem to look for it being passed - it just sets it based on a few rules. You and ted both know Makefiles better than me though, so we should probably get his review, too.
Variables passed via the commandline overrule those set in the Makefile. See http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Overriding and siblings.

This patch worked great for me. My only nit is that MOZ_MAKE_MARS should be MOZ_MAKE_MAR or MOZ_MAKE_COMPLETE_MAR -- since that's what full-update does.

updated patch for MOZ_MAKE_COMPLETE_MAR

New patch with MOZ_MAKE_COMPLETE_MAR for the relbranch. Gonna land this on trunk once Ted has reviewed this, too.

I don't see that variable being used in the update-packaging Makefile at all, I think this is unused and should be removed.
Ah, yeah. You're right. That Makefile uses STAGE_DIR -- but we don't need to pass it. It only controls the output location of the MAR and IMHO dist/$(PKG_UPDATE_PATH) is preferable to dist/install/$(PKG_UPDATE_PATH)

Updated patch that I landed, http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/dfbbf5cf98c2.

Requesting approval 1.9.1
Requesting blocking, too. We'll need this patch to actually create mars for releases.

For 3.1 Beta 2, we had a similar patch on the relbranch, http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ad29715677b4.
