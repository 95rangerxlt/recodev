Localizers, feel free to land changes towards fx3.1, I just forced builds for you.

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-l10n/ should pick up the builds once they succeed, and http://l10n.mozilla.org/dashboard/ will have compare-locales results on the fx31x tree.

Please continue to only change searchplugins and region.properties through bugs and reviewed patches.

If you have problems with hg, please poke #l10n, #hg or the l10n newsgroup.
Right, FIXED this is.
