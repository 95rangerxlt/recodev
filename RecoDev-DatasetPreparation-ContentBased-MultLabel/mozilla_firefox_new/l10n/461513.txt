add missing /$(PKG_INST_PATH) and .exe

Fall out from bug 458014, went unseen as tinderbox on Mozilla-l10n doesn't go red when l10n builds do.

I forgot a /$(PKG_INST_PATH) in the cd statement.

The blurb after download missed an trailing .exe, which confused me while trying to find the culprit here, so I'm fixing that as well.

cc-ing release, because this impacts our rel-automation prep for FF3.1beta2.

Axel, Ted: any estimate on when this can be fixed and landed?
