here's the cause, I think:

patch

note, these strings are duplicated.  the still live in places.properties, for use by http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/browser-places.js#420
in addition to the menu not having a label, the menu item won't work as we'll throw that error

Instead of duplicating the strings, would it be possible to remove the duplicate strings from places.properties, and use gNavigatorBundle with the browser.properties string in both locations? These are the only consumers of the property, so it'd be great not to duplicate.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/search?string=menuOpenInTabs.label
should be doable, since:

/browser/base/content/browser.js, line 6769 -- #include browser-places.js

so we should have access to browser.properties (via bundle_browser).

I'll investigate that (for --enabled-places, to make sure I don't break that.)

better patch

here's a better patch (thanks to dietrich for the suggestion) to move (instead of duplicating) the strings.

I've tested on trunk both with places (and without, which is now the default.)
fixed
