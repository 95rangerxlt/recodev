The scroll right button of the tab bar only gets bright, when its active and you hover over/click it, the scroll left button is always bright and only the arrow indicates the current state of the button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tabs that the scroll left and scroll right buttons appear on the tab bar
2. compare the behavior/colors of the scroll left button in its different instances/states to the behavior/colors of the scroll right button 

Actual Results:  
The scroll left button is always bright and only the arrow indicates the current state of the button.

Expected Results:  
The scroll left button should behave like the scroll right button and be only bright, when its active and you hover over/click it.

Dupe of bug 352323?
Bug 352323 in a new Win problem, the Mac problem has been existing much longer than the problem on Win already.
Please test with the 20060914 nightly build.
The problem is still existing with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060914 BonEcho/2.0 ID:2006091407
Can you please attach screenshots to show what you are seeing? ("Create a New Attachment" above). Thanks!
this does seem like the windows version of bug #352323.

I'll take a look.

screen shot demonstrating the issue
I think I can leverage the fix for bug #352323 (which is checked into the branch) and write some simple css for pinstripe's browser.css to address this.

details of tab bar scroll buttons

At the bottom of the png you can see the details. For the scroll left button the colors around the arrow are for all instances as bright as the mouse over colors of the scroll right button, while the inactive and the active, mouse out colors of the scroll right button are darker.

fix for this issue, add hover effect for the left scroll button, include nit fix for right scroll "inner" arrow
here's what's going on:  the right scroll and all tabs have opacity rules (0.65 / 1.0) which make it appear the way it is appearing.  These elements are actually stacks (for the animation effect).

the left scroll button is not a stack, and it was missing the 0.65 / 1.0 rules.  but, because it isn't a stack, setting opacity .65 will slightly "dull" the inner arrow, as compared to the right scroll button, because the .65 rule for the right scroll button is on one of the boxes on the stack, and not on the button with the inner arrow.

to fix this issue, we will need images with opacity built in, which is something we did for winstripe.  I'll log a bug on this issue. 

but, I think we want this fix for 2.0
fix landed, thanks for the prompt r/a.

as for the issue I raised, see bug #352706.  

once I get an image, I can fix that pretty easily.
