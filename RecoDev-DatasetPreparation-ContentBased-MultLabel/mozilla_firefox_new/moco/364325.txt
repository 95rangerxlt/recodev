Steps to reproduce:

- start a new profile with blank history
- open the sidebar, set "View" to "By Last Visited"
- visit https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=257334
- visit https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=362003
- verify that bug 362003 is on top in the history sidebar (that's correct)
- now do a history search for "history.dat" in the sidebar

Result: both entries change position: the last visited address is no longer on top (like in Firefox 2.0)

thanks for catching this.

here's what I did wrong:  

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/places/content/history-panel.js#110

106   // if there is a search string, root the places tree into
107   // the history root (sorted by SORT_BY_TITLE_ASCENDING)
108   // otherwise, root the tree based on gHistoryGrouping
109   if (aSearchString)
110     placeURI += "&sort=" + NHQO.SORT_BY_TITLE_ASCENDING;

I need to sort based on gHistoryGrouping, so in the case when we are grouped by last visted, I need to sort by:

placeURI += "&sort=" + NHQO.SORT_BY_DATE_DESCENDING;

Re-changing summary for leaving words out makes it very difficult for me to find.
I dropped 'reverse' from the summary because it's only a coincidental artifact of the comment 0 testcase that the titles of the visited pages sort alphabetically in the opposite order from their last visit time.
or, rather, the same, but, you get the idea :)

fix

fix this bug, and remove my optimization for " /* don't re-root if the placeURI has not changed */ ", as when you deleted the search string, we would not re-filter/re-group the results.

thanks for the review, asaf.
This is fixed indeed but now it shows a temporary hang of more than a minute when I search for the word "window" in a places.sqlite file of 2.8 MB. 
ria, is that reproducible?  which history view?  (last visited, date / site, etc..)
Tested again but now I still see a large places.sqlite.file but no history in the sidebar anymore. But when I search for the word "window", I see a hang although the search results are in the right order now.
I have browser.history_expire_days set to 900 days.
The test works fine when I run the same profile in a branch build.
Yesterday I saw the imported history in my sidebar but now only the today's history again.
If you want I can send you the profile for testing purposes (it's not very privacy sensitive but not in a way I can attach it here for there are hidden mail data). 
Tested with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a2pre) Gecko/20061229 Minefield/3.0a2pre
ria, spun off your hang issue to bug #365992.  if you have a profile that I can use, that would be great.
The problem (when having a search in history, results are not sort per the selected order) still exists in v 3.0.3/win.
And apparently on Mac (bug 434284) and linux (bug 392497).

Detailed version string:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

Please reopen.
And fix ;-)

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.

History search shows the results in wrong (reverse) sort order
