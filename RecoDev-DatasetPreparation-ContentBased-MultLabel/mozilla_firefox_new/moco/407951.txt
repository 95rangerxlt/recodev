don't reset textContent in _setUpDescription() if it hasn't changed

a potential perf win suggestion from vlad.

if we have:

<description>foo<label value="bar"/>cheese</description>

And you continue to type barcheese, the "foo" textContent will not change.

Vlad believes that it would be faster to check the textContent and not change it.

This should also pay off when we invalidate() as more results come in and the users typed text hasn't changed.

We should be able to verify this using vlad's foo.xul test case (I'll attach it.)

(soon, the label will be a html:span, but doesn't matter for this bug...)
