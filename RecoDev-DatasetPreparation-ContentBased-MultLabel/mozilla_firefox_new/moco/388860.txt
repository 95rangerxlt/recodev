Clicking the "New Folder" button on the "Add Bookmarks" panel does nothing.

I have confirmed this bug also on Windows XP: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007071905 Minefield/3.0a7pre

The odd thing about this is that no exception is thrown in the Error Console, or even in the console spew on a debug build.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page in Minefield
2. Click Bookmarks -> Bookmark This Page
3. Click the drop down arrow 
4. Click on "New Folder"

Actual Results:  
No folder is created, regardless of where in the current tree you are selected.

Expected Results:  
Folder should be created

I think this is something I broke, with my fix for bug #385990

fix

avoid my history query optimization by specifying queryType=1 (QUERY_TYPE_BOOKMARKS)
Comment on attachment 273053
fix

hrm, we should probably recommend that queryType always be used for bookmarks queries now.

I've added an assert so that we'll catch this problem next time, and it won't be silent.

I'll attach that patch.

re-opening, I backed out because the tree was closed.
I don't think this is right, queryType should be ignored for simple folder queries. I would rather make getinsertionpoint check queryType only if the root is a query node (nodeIsQuery).

Litmus Triage Team: cc'ing al and tracy for the in-litmus flag
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
