use smaller branded icons for wizard.

spun off from bug #339526.  see nick's comments and ben's comments about the size of the icon (64x64) in the wizard.

ben suggests:  use a smaller icon (32x32 instead of 64x64) unless there is a "byline"), and if so, use a 16x16 icon.  

(note to be, about the 16x16, that seems really small to me.  isn't that the size of a window icon?)

beltzner, what do you think?


the branded 64x64 icon that steven created (for bonecho and minefield) still has value, as it is used on the mac for alerts.

steven, how much work would it be to create 32x32 verisons of the icons for both the official firefox brand, bonecho and minefield?

Anyone have a screenshot of what this dialog looked like bfore it had the icon? Also, is it necessary that all wizards use an icon (and use the same icon)?

Before & after for Create Profile, Software Update and Import wizards
It is definatly not necessary that all wizards use an icon. In particular I use wizards in at least one of my extensions and I don't want an icon there.

> It is definatly not necessary that all wizards use an icon.

Good point.  Mike / Ben, what do you think? 
Ideally there would be an attribute that someone could set: off, use default, use specified. 
updating summary.  details (from beltzner) coming soon.
I think the caller of the dialog should be able to specify between no icon, default product icon, and specific wizard icon. 

IIRC, the purpose for having the icon was that in the install-and-migrate scenario, the import settings wizard would appear before Firefox, leading to some confusion about who owned the window, and where it came from. I think that's the usage heuristic that should be applied for wizard icons: when it would be otherwise impossible to determine where a window came from, we should provide some indication to the user about its predigree. So the only other wizard(s) that I can see requiring it would be the Profile Manager and Michael Wu's new extension-update-check dialog. 

But the giving the ability to XUL authors to turn it on as they see fit seems like the right thing to do. 

Ben? Sound sensible?
patch in hand, at least for the "do not show by default".

robert suggests a specific size for the wizard (39 or 37 pixels?)  I'll double check with him before requesting new icons from steven.

Yes SIR! or do you prefer that I address you as SIR SETH?

screenshot comparison

I don't have a problem with the height and width of our wizard (I actually prefer it in that it differentiates the app from standard OS wizards) but I do think the header in our wizard is too tall especially since we usually - perhaps always? - don't provide a sub-section header text in our headers.

Clearing review for now... I am fine with this overall with the added styling for winstripe but I'd like to see how this looks on Mac OS X and Linux first... I've found that we sometimes look significantly different on Linux and no one bothers reporting bugs on it.

btw: it goes against the grain to have an image that is 49px by 49px. I think it best to just use 48px for them.

good point.  I also agree with you on using 48px.  here's my new todo list:

1) create 48x48 images (icon48.png) for bonecho, minefield and official branding
2) test out robert's suggest css improvement
3) get some screen shots on windows, mac and linux
4) seek review
I can provide the 48px images. We already have them for the branded version and trunk version as 48px is one of the default sizes for WinXP icons. Will post here shortly.

*** Bug 344555 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
robert asked me to check some mac applications to see if their wizards are branded or not.  

my conclusion is that for wizards, they are branded, but not always the same way.

let me attach some screen shots.

so for this bug I think we should brand for all platforms, but then open a new bug on mac os x to brand more like how apple mail, airport setup assistant, and migration assistant are branded.

cc'ing pink, mark and josh who have forgotten more about standard mac application UI then I'll ever know.

They're not called wizards on the Mac, they're called assistants.  (I always thought that calling them wizards was pretty lame.)

The standard Mac appearance is roughly as the screen shots Seth posted depict, but assistants aren't used too frequently on the Mac.  The appearance particulars aren't so well-specified other than that "it should look sort of like this."

thanks for the info and the link, mark.
