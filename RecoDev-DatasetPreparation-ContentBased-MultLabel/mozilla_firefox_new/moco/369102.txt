support installing 1.5.0.x back over 2.0.0.x (after a major update) 

after we present the major update to 2.0.0.x, some users are going to want to return to 1.5.0.x.  they will go get a new 1.5.0.x installer, and install on top over the default location:  C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox

fx 2.0.0.x has added js and c++ XPCOM components (and other new files, I'm sure) that might break 1.5.0.x as those new files are not listed in the MOZILLA_1_8_0_BRANCH version of mozilla/browser/installer/removed-files.in

I think we should identity the list of files and directories, and add them to removed-files.in before we ship 1.5.0.10

cc'ing mscott, as he might want to do the same for tbird.

My vote: WONTFIX. we have never supported overwriting with an old version. You must uninstall the new version before overwriting with the old version. You can't expect the old version to magically know about new stuff in the future.

Jay says wanted because it sounds easy and even if they run an older installer they will upgrade to a 1.5.0.10+ that has these removed-files bits. Still not a blocker, but OK, we'll consider a patch.
dan, the only I reason I mention it here is the following scenario:

1) user is running 1.5.0.x
2) major upgrade to 2.0.0.x
3) they are unable to use 2.0.0.x for some reason, but still want firefox, until we fix their issue (say, in 2.0.0.y), they go back to 1.5.0.x by getting the installer.  they do a default install on top of C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox

optionally, later, when we ship 2.0.0.y, they may get another major update notice.

I have a feeling this sort of thing is going to happen, and while we may not officially support it, we could head some problems off at the pass by adding the necessary files to remove-files.in
from my windows diff, here is what I'm seeing:

I think the things we should care the most about are the components new to Fx 2.0.0.x:

> ./components/FeedConverter.js
> ./components/FeedProcessor.js
> ./components/FeedWriter.js
> ./components/myspell.dll
> ./components/nsBookmarkTransactionManager.js
> ./components/nsMicrosummaryService.js
> ./components/nsSafebrowsingApplication.js
> ./components/nsSearchService.js
> ./components/nsSearchSuggestions.js
> ./components/nsSessionStartup.js
> ./components/nsSessionStore.js
> ./components/nsUrlClassifierLib.js
> ./components/nsUrlClassifierListManager.js
> ./components/nsUrlClassifierTable.js
> ./components/nsURLFormatter.js
> ./components/spellchk.dll
> ./components/WebContentConverter.js

but there are other differences too.

bsmedberg / gavin:  any comments on this plan?

Are there any examples of problems that this would solve? Comment 0 says there are files that "might break" 1.5.0.x, but I'm not sure offhand which those might be. The extra components listed in comment 3 don't seem to negatively affect my 1.5.0.9 build.

I'm afraid that this is going to become a maintenance nightmare, with us having to keep the manifest updated to account for new components, for different releases etc. If there's no proven benefit, I'd tend to think we should avoid doing it.
thanks for the feedback, gavin.  what your wrote in comment #4 makes sense.

I'm going to do this pave over install, and double check that nothing bad happens.  (actually, I think someone in QA tried already as well.  possibly juan?)
We may want to test this pave-over a little furter. In my limited testing, while nothing bad seems to happen and the 15010 seems to work, there are traces of the 2002(major updated) version, in the Add/Remove Programs, for example. If you remove it, your newly installed 15010 stops working. It might be a little confusing for the user.
I also did some testing of this scenario on Vista, and while things worked as expected, I didn't actually go in and check directories.

good catch! I didn't think of that scenario, which is the 2.0.0.2 uninstaller being left around, when you do a pave over install with 1.5. 

while I don't think we can prevent 2.0.0.2 from being listed, we should add the 2.0.0.2 uninstaller (uninstall/helper.exe) to the list, if we decide to take this fix.
Seth: did you have a patch ready for this?
comparing 1.5.0.10 to 2.0.0.2, here's the full list of files and directories  only in 2.0.0.2.

note, this patch is for 1.5.0.10 (the MOZILLA_1_8_0) branch only.
Seth:  I know a few of us have talked about taking this, but who else do we need to have buy in from in order to get this landed?  Can you make sure the right folks have a look at the patch so we can come to some sort of consensus tomorrow?
jay:  I think dveditz and rstrong are on board, but getting their official reviews would be good.

after that, just your approval to land.

gavin was not hot on this (see his comment #4), and he's right, going forward as stuff gets added to 2.0.0.x or for 3.x, this problem continues to go.  But I'm just trying to do a "best effort" to minimize the problems from my real world scenario in comment #2.

gavin, if you want to weigh in again for a final verdict, I'd appreciated it.
(In reply to comment #14)
> gavin, if you want to weigh in again for a final verdict, I'd appreciated it.

I still don't understand why we want to do this. We've never done this before, as far as I know. Whatever problems you envision us having when people downgrade from 2.0.0.x to 1.5.0.x could have happened if people had done the same from 1.5.0.x to 1.0.x, right? Other than the major update notification code, which could potentially cause the volume of "downgrades" to increase, what's changed between those two situations that's requiring this extra effort?

And what is it really gaining us? From what I can tell - and perhaps I'm missing something here - we haven't even determined that this is fixing an actual problem - "possible problems" are all that's mentioned in this bug report.

On the other hand, the patch itself doesn't look like something that would be very risky (though I must admit I haven't gone through all of the upgrade-downgrade-upgrade scenarios in my head), so if everyone is convinced that it's clearly beneficial, I don't really have any other objections.
gavin, thanks for the quick response.

see juan's comment #6 for a real example.  to summarize, after the scenario I describe, you then go to Add / Remove Programs, and remove 2.0.0.2.  Because the uninstaller exists (uninstall/helper.exe) we run it, and it horks 1.5.0.10 (because they are in the same directory).  [and uninstall/uninst.exe is just the 2.0.0.1 version of this scenario.]

as for the other files I'm removing, you are right, I don't have an example of a problem they are causing.

patch

I'm fine with this as a best effort "effort". One thing I would like to see is the addition of the following from the trunk:
Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest
msvcm80.dll
msvcp80.dll
msvcr80.dll

since these do cause an error during startup whenever we register components (e.g. first run, extension install, etc.).
Created attachment 255065
screenshot of error on 1.5.0.9 after installing it over Granpa Radiso

This error is shown twice during startup when we re-register components due to the app restarting.
I think the reason for my hesitance, more concisely, is that we don't want to get stuck on the slippery slope of supporting "broken" installs (which are hopefully a relatively rare occurrence) if we can't do a good enough job that it's worth the effort.

I think you've successfully proven that we can do a good enough job in this case, and avoiding the problems Rob and Juan point out is obviously desirable.

Purely out of curiosity, if we remove the uninstaller, but leave the registry keys pointing to it, what happens when the user goes to uninstall the program via Add/Remove? I guess that probably results in the "application is already uninstalled, would you like to remove it's entry" message I seem to recall getting from XP? Either way, it's almost certainly better than wiping out 1.5.0.x, you're right.
Bug 367539 should remove the need for this after it have been fixed so this won't become a maintenance nightmare.

Approved for 1.8 branch, a=jay (Seth already landed this earlier today, we just forgot to update the bug)
verified fixed for 1.8.1.2 and 1.8.0.10 using :
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070215 Firefox/2.0.0.2 ID:2007021518 (RC4)

done some testings on this bug and the scenario from comment #2 worked as expected. 
For the record, I think that we should not support these types of scenarios into the future for many of the reasons that Gavin cited. In addition, April 24th 2007 we cease support for Firefox 1.5 series and it'll be even harder to download :-). So, this effort although admirable has a very short shelf life (3-4 months).
Agreed though the risk and effort were minimal and this is just a best effort to lessen the issues people could run into if they choose to downgrade after receiving a software update which we are planning on turning on soon.

btw: Bug 367539 will provide essentially this same functionality after it is fixed.
