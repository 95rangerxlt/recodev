implement history sidebar on top of places backend

note, on the trunk, even if you enable places, the history side bar doesn't exist. 

Neither does the bookmarks sidebar.

start at browser/base/content/browser-sets.inc, look for history-panel.xul

we'll need a places version of history-panel.xul
if you apply the patch in bug #356487 and then build with places, you'll notice the menu items and commands are back to view the history sidebar, but there is no history panel.

in mozilla/browser/components/Makefile.in, if MOZ_PLACES is defined, we won't build mozilla/browser/components/history, which contains history-panel.xul       history.js

for this bug, I plan on implementing the same UI Fx 2, but on top of the places tree view.

the ported sidebar is in bug #356487 (still a work in progress.)

note, bug #358771 blocks one issue with the sidebar, the drop down image appears in the view button.


fixed, but two outstanding bugs:

bug #359462: context menu delete and keyboard delete doesn't work in places-based history sidebar
bug #358784: need group by date (so "View | By Date" and "View | By Date and Site" don't work)
