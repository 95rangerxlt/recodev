Rob - I'm not sure how much of a review this needs
- it's just tests for GCLI
- the parts have been reviewed as part of GCLI's normal process, so r+fitzgan and r+mikeratcliffe
I should add - there is an error somewhere, which is causing an error which creates a memory leak. I'll be fixing that first thing next week, and then assuming review is OK, we can land this.
I get this:

When there are execution errors we want to have them reported, not hidden, otherwise we'll never know if these tests become broken by some other patch we push to the repo. This test, for example, should have shown at least a failure.

upload 1 was broken by some refactoring in another bug.
This is now clean for me.
