Possible icons we can use :
- Pseudo class lock icon (My favourite)
- Sidebar toggle icon
I can't seem to find the lock icon you mention, the sidebar toggle icon looks good btw.

This icon : http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/49683d4e9ebd/browser/themes/shared/devtools/images/pseudo-class.svg#pseudo-class

Seems to illustrate pretty well the idea of presets.
Weird, I can't find the file on my local build, I just updated the repository to make sure, it's not there.

mahdi :: ~/Documents/Workshop/Firefox/browser/themes/shared/devtools/images ~ $ ls | grep pseudo

What am I doing wrong?

This icon was added in Firefox 41. So updating was probably not needed

It should be in that directory, not sure what's happening there. Maybe you could try using the Finder/File Explorer instead to find the file. 

Also, have you tried compiling Firefox and checking if the icon is at (0) ? Can you also check if your rule view has this (1) ?

If it's missing in either case, you likely have a problem with your Mercurial/Github setup, you may want to reach people in #introduction on IRC in that case.

Bug 1184110 - Use a pretty icon button for toggling the presets list in the CSS Filter tooltip; r=ntim

Hey, sorry for the delay, I couldn't get any help on IRC, did some stuff and found that I had forgot to remove my own .eslintrc after Patrick added an .eslintrc to the repository, it was causing conflicts, thus `hg update` would not work and I had not noticed this as I don't manually run the commands required to update my nightly, I have a bash script, I run it and sleep, usually.

Anyways, here is the patch.

Thanks Tim

I'd probably just use #toggle-presets here and below and then not add an extra class to the element.  If we need to reuse it later it could be converted to a class

Should this be `margin: 0 5px` or are you intentionally adding 5px margin to the top and bottom?

Is there a selector for when the presets list is visible?  if so, we could swap out the background with chrome://browser/skin/devtools/pseudo-class.svg#pseudo-class-checked to show that the section is active.

Thanks for pointing these out, fixed 'em. Good idea to toggle icon's state between checked/unchecked.
