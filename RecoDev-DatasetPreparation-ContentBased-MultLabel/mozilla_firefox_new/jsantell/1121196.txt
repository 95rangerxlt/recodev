This rerenders the flamegraph when switching between recordings. Also, added few more isRecording checks so we dont rerender when going to a currently recording model. This looks a bit weird, but will be more performant, and will look nicer once bug 1121086 lands, which will hide details view for an active recording.

Try tree closed, but this doesn't touch any other code anyway as no performance tests get run.

Looks like 'stopped' and 'selected' are synonymous here. Maybe it'd be nice to refactor this into using a single function. Better yet, make sure that's the case everywhere in the new perf tool (if two event listeners do the exact same thing, then just have a single function).

Consolidated stopped/selected for all detail views since they're all the same

FlameGraph should be toggled when switching recordings in perf tool
