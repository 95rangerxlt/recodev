Can't describe this one well, so here's a gif.

When hiding "Function Calls", all of the "DOM Events" are hidden as well except one. Most markers are DOM Events enveloping Function Calls. This is very weird.

Looks like bug 1176537 fixes this, but need to write a test for that -- I thought we had something similar, but I guess we don't have an xpcshell test for both filtering and collapsing in one go.

Looks like that marker fix did fix this as well. Here's a test ensuring that.
