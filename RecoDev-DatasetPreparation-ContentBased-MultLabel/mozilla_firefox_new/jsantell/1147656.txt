Shame that an order of magnitude still doesn't make this better :\
I really think we should ask :djvj to review this as well.

So a ProfileEntry is 9 bytes on a platform, so making this buffer 10million in size means we're allocating a 90-meg buffer for profiling.  Should be fine, as dev machines are large, but we may want to make this tunable in the future.
