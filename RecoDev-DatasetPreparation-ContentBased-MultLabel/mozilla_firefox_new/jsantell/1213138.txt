We have react and redux in our tree, and this small library combines them splendidly.

Why do you specify the paths in here? The ones they need to update are in react-redux.js right?
Gerv, any chance you could look at this soon, or can someone else review licensing? We're dependent on this for the fall release in 3 weeks.

Correct, this just lists what those variables should be in react-redux -- would it make more sense to remove these?
Hey gerv: The license for react-redux is here: https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/LICENSE.md
That's fine. Land the license in the usual way in toolkit/content/license.html.

Made changes based on James' feedback to clarify the upgrade notes, to make it look less like JavaScript and just list the paths.

Thanks Gerv!
