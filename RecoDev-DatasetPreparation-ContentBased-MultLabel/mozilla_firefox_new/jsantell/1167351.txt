Front end for bug 1050500
I think there's nothing to do here because the function-to-be-called is
represented as a sort of phony stack frame.  This is slightly weird but
it came from trying to also deal with the async stack; which has subsequently
been postponed.
ah, so we won't have the entry JS function name here with bug 1050500? Or only for async stacks?

We'll have the name, but the code in marker-details.js will display it without
any further changes, as it will look like a stack with a single frame.
Marker views are a lot nicer now, more declarative, so taking this single frame stack and turning it into be displayed is easy
I think this is good to go in that case, TT can you confirm?
Yes, I think this bug was already fixed by bug 1050500.
Really clearing needinfo.
Resolving this in that case


Display JS function name in markers
