Can you file a follow up to investigate creating a side-array of only the gc markers the first time we iterate over markers (when rendering the waterfall, since we had to have done that once in order to click the button and run this code) so that we can use that side-array here and only iterate over the relatively few markers we care about? I imagine it shouldn't be too hard (famous last words) and should save us a bunch of work here. Does that make sense?

GC allocation trigger button should snap to the current GC cycle, not previous GC marker
