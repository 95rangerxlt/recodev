I'm assuming we would also want this to work for undefined?

console.log("%s", undefined) -> "undefined"

This should work.

String(undefined) -> "undefined"

Looks good. Thank you!

Please add a test so we won't cause regressions down the road.

HUDService.jsm doesn't appear to be affected by this bug. I didn't see any reference to the format specifics in the code. Fixing ConsoleAPI.js also fixed the errors that were appearing in WebConsole "args.shift() is null".

That's right, parameter substitution is implemented completely in ConsoleAPI.js. This bug is really my fault from bug 614586, so thank you for fixing it!
