WinME.  Error message when launching Firebird as listed above (clicking on OK
closes program).  Suspect it's something I did when I ran the Multizilla install
while in Firebird (Firebird was working fine - 0.6.1 -, but I downloaded 0.7 and
installed it).  Starting Firebird shows Multizilla tab bar (at least I think
that's what it is), and error message.  Now I can't figure out how to stop it
from showing up, if that's what the problem really is (or is it supposed to be
there?).  Somewhere in a "prefs.js" file maybe?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Unzip Firebird to a directory (build 0.6.1 or ver. 0.7).
2.Start/run "MozillaFirebird.exe"
3.

Actual Results:  
Get error message.

Expected Results:  
Started Firebird browser.

Looked through the reports, but didn't find anything similar.  Sorry if this is
already covered somewhere else (and I just couldn't find it).  Love the product.
 Keep up the good work.

As far as I can tell from the MultiZilla website, Firebird isn't officially
supported yet.  Should this be filed in mozdev's bugzilla?
See http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=36466 This seems to be a side
effect of the recent widgets / bindings change.
I get this also with the last few nightlies: 20031128 and 20031130 specifically
Clean installs and profiles yield same results, but older versions open without
problems with same profiles.
Phil,

Try this:

1. Download the latest nightly build of Firebird.
2. Remove the current Firebird installation directory.
3. Remove the current Firebird profile directory (%appdata%\phoenix).
4. Install the latest Firebird build.

If it starts up ok, try installing multizilla.  If it fails then, submit a bug
to the multizilla project, and report back here with your findings.

Firebird is all better now (Thanks much, Ashley!!!  Suspect it was the
%appdata%\phoenix that was biting me every time I tried to start F'bird)
Being a newbie, I didn't really necessarily want to use Multizilla with
Firebird, but being a bit stupid, I selected install while using Firebird (and
then the problems began).  I think I'll leave Multizilla with Mozilla (works
great there, when I want to flip back and forth between several related
items/sites).  And then just use "Ctrl-T" to open a new tab in Firebird if I
really want one there.  Otherwise, I'll leave it (F'bird) as is for maximum speed.
Don't know if I can change this to fixed, or if someone else takes care of that.

Regards to all, Phil Huffsmith
