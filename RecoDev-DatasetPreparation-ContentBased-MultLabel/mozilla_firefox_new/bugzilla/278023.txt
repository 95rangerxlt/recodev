The left column is meant to be 220px wide.  However, it inexplicably increases
width to show a 20px gap between it and the right half of the table.

The page is HTML 4.1 Transitional compliant, and the majority of the rest of the
site does not exhibit this behavior.

By turning borders on in the main table, it was clear that the left column is
the one that actually expanded.

Shows widened left column.

This shows what a horizontal gap in the background images.
It's easier/quicker to reproduce by clicking on the Executive Board link than
by refreshing.	It also often happens on first load.
Though I thought I'd tested everything and had even made it html 4.01
transitional compliant, I'd apparently left out defining the left column size of
the outer table. 

By adding a width=" line to the td of this table, I seem to have resolved this
issue.


Table rendering inconsistent - column expands 20px  upon refresh
