why try / catch in adjustTabstrip() in tabbrowser.xml?

we're not sure why, which is why we added the "XXXzeniko" comment:

           case 1:
             try {
...
             }
             catch (e) {
               // XXXzeniko what error are we catching here?
             }

Remove try clause

All it is is just setting an attribute, the same in all other cases. I don't see the need for a try clause either.
Getting the boxObject property can apparently sometimes fail, perhaps that was an issue at some point?

hmm, maybe I hit this sometimes before the boxObject was defined?  I wrote most of this months ago...

I'd say try the patch on trunk, but not worth taking on branch unless the try/catch is deemed harmful.
