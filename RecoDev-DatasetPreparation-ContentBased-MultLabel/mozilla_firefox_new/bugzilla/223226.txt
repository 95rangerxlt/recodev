Sorry, wasn't specified browser version/build.

MozillaFirebird-0.7-i686-linux-gtk2+xft

Downloaded when Mozilla-1.5/Firebird 0.7/Thunderbird 0.3 was publicly released
(Oct 15, 2003).
Does this problem still exist?  Are any other Mozilla apps running at the same time?
Some kind of problem in my RAID device, had redone it (raid5) from scratch,
problem goes away.

Hardware/OS problem.

Fixed.
