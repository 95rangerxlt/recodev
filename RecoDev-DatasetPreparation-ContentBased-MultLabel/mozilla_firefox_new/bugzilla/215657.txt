Live365 streams audio via a file with a .pls extension.  When you select a
station, an additional browser window opens, known as the "player" window.  The
player window shows the current and prior two songs streamed for the channel. 
The player window opens and displays correctly, and the .pls file appears on my
desktop.  The .pls file should be handled by iTunes.  Instead, iTunes never
opens and Firebird crashes.

This problem is not a problem in Mozilla 1.4 or 1.5 alpha.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  go to http://www.live365.com
2.  select a station to listen to
3.  watch firebird crash after player window opens.

Actual Results:  
firebird crashes every time.

Expected Results:  
Not crashed and called iTunes to handle the .pls file.

I get no crash running a 08/08 cvs build (os x)... i get the player selection
popup... choose MP3 player... then get prompted for what to do with the .pls file

the only odd thing is that iTunes is greyed out in the file picker window so i
couldn't tell FB to use it in this case... had to backtrack and save to desktop
instead... but that seems like a totally different issue.

Reporter, can you please attach the entry in the Firebird crash log that
corresponds to this crash? (should be at or near the bottom of
~/Library/logs/CrashReporter/MozillaFirebird.crash.log)  
Sorry - no such log.  I looked both in my directory and in the main Library
directory.  Both have a logs dir, but neither have the sub CrashReporter.  When
I first launch Firebird upon installing a new version the "QA" and "Debug" menu
items are available, but as soon as I begin using Firebird the menu items disappear.

I trashed the "Phoenix" dir to start clean and still the crash.  I'm never asked
which program to use to handle .pls files.

I downloaded the most recent nightly build and still have the same problem... 
Please give me clue on how to log so I can make this bug have value...

Thanks,   ---DV
odd... if you open /Applications/Utilities/Console.app see preferences > Crashes
and make sure "Enable Crash Reporting" is checked...

crashes then should write a log to the location I mentioned earlier. (once you
get a crash log for this bug feel free to turn it off again if you want to save
HDD space)
Here's what I see in the console when it crashes:

...
dyld: /Applications/Mozilla Firebird.app/Contents/MacOS/MozillaFirebird-bin
Undefined symbols:

/Applications/Mozilla Firebird.app/Contents/MacOS/components/libimgicon.dylib
undefined reference to _ReleaseIconRef expected to be defined in ApplicationServices
...

Still no log, even when box checked.

In case it's not indicated, I'm running OS X 10.1.5.  If this version is too old
and it's the problem, no problem - Mozilla 1.5 alpha is working fine and I can
just switch back.
.pls works for me at mostlyclassical.com.  didn't feel like setting up a live365
account to test there. :)

.pls defaulted to itunes, i hit ok, and everything just worked.  (i must say i'm
a bit impressed that it did work so cleanly.)
should be fixed from bug 213639 checkin.
