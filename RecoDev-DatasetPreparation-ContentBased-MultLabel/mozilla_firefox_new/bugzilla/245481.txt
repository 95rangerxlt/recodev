This website http://www.bozemandeaconess.org contains DHTML menus. The menus use
very simple Javascript and work properly in Firefox for windows and Linux.
However on OS X they do not work at all. In theory it seems that if it works on
one platform it should work on the others, thats the beauty of the Gecko engine
right?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.bozemandeaconess.org in Windows and mouseover the menu items. DHTML!
2.go to www.bozemandeaconess.org in OS X and mouseover the menu items. nothing...

I know the dreaded question... have you tried a new profile why a new build?
Not exactly sure what you mean by new profile/new build. The problem is
reproducable on any Mac with OS X. (Ive tried it on half a dozen different
machines at least.)
0.8 is outdated. You can download a nightly build here:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-0.9/

Make sure to backup your profile first. If this sound to risky you want might to
wait for the final 0.9 release.
The problem is resolved in Firefox .9 RC.


DHTML doesnt work on OS X but does work on Windows and Linux
