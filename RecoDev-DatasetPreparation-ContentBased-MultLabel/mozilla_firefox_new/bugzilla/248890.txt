User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/125.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/125.7
Build Identifier: 

So I download firefox, hoping to build it ontop of my mozilla, but as soon as I try and open the 
application, it starts up for a bit, asks me for the profile to use, which I select.

I watch as the icon bounces up and down on the dock, meaning that it's busy..

And then it vanishes.

If I wait for a bit, roughly 10-20 seconds, it'll come right back, bounce a while, and disappear again. I've 
found the only way to get it to stop this is to catch it, and force quit it while it's bouncing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try and open firefox.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
The details above occured.

Expected Results:  
It should have started up with a browser, not play some nutty game of hide'n'seek with me.

Nothing I can think of.. feel free to contact me for further information.

Did you start Firefox from the disk image, or copy it to your hard drive first?
......

Well I'm an idiot. It's working fine now! Thanks for the help, and teaching me an aspect of this new 
system. ^_^


Firefox acts very unusual when starting up.. and then just won't start.
