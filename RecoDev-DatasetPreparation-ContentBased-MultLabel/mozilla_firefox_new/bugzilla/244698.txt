/Library/Mozilla /Applications/Firefox.app) with each build listed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit any page with a form, eg www.google.com
2. Enter some search text.
3. Submit the form (by pressing Enter or clicking Submit)

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens - no form submission, no javascript errors.

Expected Results:  
Submitted the form.

It seems to only be present in the Mac builds, I just tested it on another computer running a fresh 
(unpatched) installation of 10.3 server, build 7B86 and was able to duplicate the problem.

I haven't reproduced this, but since there are so many other reports I'm
comfirming this major regression.
Getting reports of this on the branch. We cannot ship 0.9 with this bug.
I managed to reproduce this while testing out a whole bunch of builds,
unfortunately I donâ€™t remember which one it was.. I *think* it was an aviary
branch build.

Setting blocking0.9+ since we've had so many reports of this on the branch. This
is a real showstopper bug.

Also in comment 6, just to clarify, I haven't reproduced this because I don't
have an OSX machine, not becaused I tried and it worked.
Confirmed with both yesterday's and today's build, I thought I was going nuts:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040529 Firefox/0.8.0+
This seems to have been related to 243482 - i.e. some resource must not have
been packaged, thus causing a silent failure. This is fixed now, branch and trunk. 
*** Bug 245937 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
reopening - there are multiple reports (in bug 245937 and bug 246176) of this
happening on Mac and Windows in the 0.9RC and a build from June 9.
I can't reproduce this on 0.9RC/win2k

For those people seeing this on recent builds, are you using older profiles?
extensions?
Michael, I think whatever these folk are seeing is a separate bug. The bug
described originally here is 100% reproducable, I cannot reproduce the failed
logins on any of the sites linked. This might be related to installing over the
top of an older build. Can people please verify? 
Indeed. I've probably gone a bit too far with the duping. I'll undupe bug 
245937 and people experiencing the bug can continue discussion there. Sorry for 
generating extra bugmail...
