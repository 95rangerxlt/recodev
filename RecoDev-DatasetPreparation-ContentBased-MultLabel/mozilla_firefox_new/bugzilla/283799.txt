I heard about this bug from a comment posted on Asa Dotzler's weblog, but didn't
find any related bug in bugzilla. Hope it's not a dupe...


----
If I enter the URL: https://agia.fsf.org/order/
I get the padlock in the bottom and the address bar is yellow.

Now if I click on one of the #refs, eg the link "Software",
I lose the padlock and the yellow address bar.

Pasting the full url https://agia.fsf.org/order/#software
gives the secure feedback, but clicking another #ref
loses it again.
----

I can confirm it too. This is a new bug introduced by version 1.0.1
Firefox 1.0 handles this fine.


Good luck and congratulations for all your work!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to https://agia.fsf.org/order/
2. Notice the location bar is yellow. Fine.
3. Now click on any of the internal (to the page) links, such as "Software"


Actual Results:  
Location bar isn't yellow anymore. No more padlock as well. But we're still on a
https site.

Expected Results:  
Continue to confirm we're on a https site: location bar should still be yellow
and padlock be displayed.

Bug not platform dependent, it's also present on the following Windows build:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225
Firefox/1.0.1

Just put a simple <a href='#'>Click</a> link on a https page to verify bug.  
This Bug is evil in combination with Bug 140837  and a navigation frame which
contains javascript links :

<a href="#" onclick="javascript_link_function()".

That's why page security status remains always to be shown as mixed/broken.
This bug also occurs with Mozilla 1.8b1... Product: Core?
This bug appears to be fixed in the 1.0.2 release candidate
Yes, see bug 283733.

I didn't see any attachments or other postings as to what fixed this. Was it
also fixed on "core"?

It seems this was fixed by core bug 283733, a recent Mozilla 1.8b2 build works
for me.


Security signs (padlock, yellow location bar) disappears when I click on #ref links
