User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.org

Default browser was IE 6.0. After installing Mozilla Firefox on Sept. 15, and 
making it the default browser, this resulted in a total system slow down. 
Programs would not open quickly as they did prior to installing Firefox. When 
clicking the Start button in XP it would take a number of seconds for the next 
frame to open, and when moving cursor over Programs it would take many seconds 
for that frame to appear.  The installation also caused Trend Micro Internet 
Security application to stop working. Had to uninstall Firefox and required 
technical assistance to correct problems that still remained. Also had to 
uninstall and reinstall Trend Micro Internet Security application.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Mozilla Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
As described in Details.

Expected Results:  
Should have had no effect on system performance.

my observations of firefox running slow
Found the following on the Trendmicro.com support site:

solutionID=21775

Problem:   The PCCGuide module (PCCGuide.exe) in PC-cillin Internet Security 
2004 causes 100% CPU usage after the Firefox browser is installed on the 
computer. 
  
Solution:   Currently, PC-cillin Internet Security 2004 does not support the 
Firefox browser.

Aside from the slow performance of the computer, users will notice that other 
features of PC-cillin Internet Security 2004, such as the Web Filter, will not 
be functional anymore once the Firefox browser is installed on the machine.
