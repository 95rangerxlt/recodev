On a Sun Ray system we have the following behaviour:
whenever the browser window is active and we simultaneously press SHIFT and
RIGHT or LEFT arrow (VK_LEFT // VK_RIGHT), the browser crashes. Expected
behaviour is to increase (/decrease) the selection (in textareas, but also just
plain html) with one character.

The UP and DOWN arrows do work as expected (increase the selection with one line).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox (tried with 0.8 and 0.9)
2. Click somewhere in a html page
3. Hit SHIFT + RIGHT arrow simultaneously
4. See browser die :<

Actual Results:  
Firefox spits its last words:
GLib-CRITICAL **: file gstrfuncs.c: line 186: assertion `string1 != NULL' failed.
Pangolite:./startff: line 1: 24898 Segmentation Fault      (
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sfw/lib/:. ./firefox-bin )

comments: startff is a small wrapper script to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
running firefox-bin

Expected Results:  
increase (/decrease) the selection

We're running Solaris 9, and I have used the sparc-sun-solaris2.8 build. Firefox
runs fine otherwise from this really unwanted behaviour.

The following is all the output from the shell:

--------
$ startff &

$
