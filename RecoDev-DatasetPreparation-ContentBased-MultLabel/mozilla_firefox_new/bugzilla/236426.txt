Looking at ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable, in Firefox 0.8,
it would appear that openssh-3.8p1.tar.gz was created on "02/24/2003", however
the file has a date of "02/24/2004" (notice the year) in lynx.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox to ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/
2. look at date of openssh-3.8p1.tar.gz
3. compare to date shown in lynx.

Actual Results:  
Lynx shows a date of "02/24/2004"
Firefox shows a date of "02/24/2003"

Expected Results:  
Firefox should display the correct year.

This confusion in the display of file timestamps can cause some people to
mistake newer software versions as old software and to incorrectly assume an
older version is the latest version.

I can confirm this on my nightly build of Firefox.

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040302 Firefox/0.8.0+

It seems to be related to incorrect handling of the leap year.  If I set my
computer's date back to February 27, 2004 then Firefox shows the correct
timestamp on that file of 02/24/2004.  When I set the date on my computer to
today's date, 03/04/2004, and reload
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable openssh-3.8pl.tar.gz shows
the wrong timestamp of 02/24/03 again.
Father Time has cured this bug... all it took was a few days. I'll revist this
in 4 years time to see if it resurfaces.  :)
Well, in a few hours we will know if this bug is truly fixed :-)
