Screen shot

Screen shot of "warn leaving secure" dialog.
This works for me using a recent nightly from the trunk. Can you check in a
recent nightly and see whether this is still a problem or not.
A problem may occur depending on a setup of the used language of OS.
(By the case of bug233752, the trifling problem has occurred in the bookmark
tool bar.)
When the following contents are added to a userChrome.css file, does a problem fix?

   Contents added to userChrome.css:

   * {
       font-family: "Lucida Grande", sans-serif !important;
   }

When a problem fixes by this customize, depending on a language setup used by
OS, the problem similar to these regards me as still generating in other scenes.
This is not good when using languages other than English (when Japanese is being
used at least).

Reproduced with Mac Firefox in Japanese locale.
Mac Firefox in English locale and Mozilla App suite in Japanese locale
don't have this problem.
Probably related to Bug 233781, but the tip in comment 3 doesn't work
in this case.

Marking New.

screenshot (English locale vs Japanese locale)
The dialog width is too narrow in Japanese locale.
Seems like max-width: 40em of #commonDialog is enough for Lucida Grande,
but not for Hiragino font.

Workaround using userChrome.css:

#commonDialog { font-family: "Lucida Grande" !important; }
#commonDialog > hbox > vbox > description,
#commonDialog > hbox > vbox > vbox > description {
  font: bold 13px/16px "Lucida Grande" !important;
}
#checkboxContainer {
  font-size: 11px;
  line-height: 13px;
}

changing the summary and making dependency on Bug 233781.
As a workaround about this I included #6 css rule into intl.css of ja-JPM
http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n-aviarybranch/source/toolkit/locales/ja-JPM/chrome/global/intl.css
This workaround is not good solution and cannot be used other loacle because this
css rule should be used only in Mac.

c.f.
Russian Mac have similar problem (Bug 267989).
They cannot do same as japanese because they don't have separate tree of l10n cvs.
intl.css in Firefox 1.0 ja-JPM doesn't work because other css rules are included
together.
Dom Inspector shows as follows:

In English locale:
#commonDialog
 font-family: Lucida Grande
 font-size: 11px
 max-width: 440px
 min-width: 319px
 width: 504px     <- see

In Japanese locale:
#commonDialog
 font-family: Hirahigo Kaku Go Pro
 font-size: 11px
 max-width: 440px
 min-width: 319px
 width: 413px

So max-width 40em of #commonDialog is not correct.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/themes/pinstripe/global/global.css#142
It should be 48em at least (or it should be removed).

patch2 (613px)

#commonDialog > xul:vbox > hbox > vbox has 45em (495px) as max-width.
.alert-icon has width:64px; margin-left:6px; margin-right:20px.
<dialog> has padding:14px.
So max-width for #commonDialog should be 613px (56em) if it's specified.

I recommend removing it.
Changing the summary.

613px is too big.
Created attachment 166774
patch3 (437px or more)
max-width:45em for the inner vbox is specified in commonDialog.xul that
is shared by all platforms.
It's necessary to remove max-width:40em for #commonDialog and overwrite
max-width:30em for the inner vbox in global.css, I think.

The problem is solved on the following builds at least if the patch is applied.
- English build in Japanese locale
- Italian build in Italian locale
- Russian build in English locale

as this is a theme fix, you should ask kevin gerich for r= (webmail AT kmgerich

Comment on attachment 166774

please change the max-width to 33em. otherwise +. Would you like me to check
this in?
Yes, please check it in.
