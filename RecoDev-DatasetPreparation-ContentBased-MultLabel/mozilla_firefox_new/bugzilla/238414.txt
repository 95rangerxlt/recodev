When browsing sites that start with http://ftp and ftp://ftp, memory usage can
spike to the point that Firefox can hang or crash, and in serious situations,
can take Windows down with it because of low memory.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type in a site (example:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/ or
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly.
2. Click go or hit Enter to load the site.

Actual Results:  
Firefox won't load the page and memory usage spikes.

Expected Results:  
Firefox loads the site and memory usage does not spike.

ftp:// added 8kb to my memory and no spikes , so it's not a Windows 2000 problem.

Can you reproduce this bug with an official nightly build? According to your
posts on mozillazine you add the patches for Bug 101249 and Bug 204519. Does the
build that you are reporting this on have these too.
Yes, I can reproduce it on the 2004-03-23 official nightly as well. The build I
reported it on does have the pathes for Bugs 101249 and 204519.

I think this is fixed, and this bug can most likely be closed.  I can verify 
that it was broken in the .8 milestone on both Win2k and XP, but on another 
machine I'm running the 4/26 nightly and it works fine.
As of today's build, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1, en-US; rv:1.8a)
Gecko/20040511 Firefox/0.8.0+ (djeter), it works fine for me. I can verify that
yesterday's official build worked for me as well. I believe we can mark this bug
as fixed and close this bug out.


Browsing http://ftp and ftp://ftp sites causes memory usage to spike
