Bug 76197, "Scrollbars should look disabled when there's nowhere to scroll", was
a Core/Layout bug, and is currently marked FIXED. However, getting it actually
fixed for Firefox apparently involves additional changes to Firefox-specific files.

A Firefox patch was proposed on that bug (attachment 159851), but was never
reviewed.

that patch is checked in now.
Still not fixed on OS X: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;
rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20041208 Firefox/1.0+

Should I reopen this bug, or submit a separate one?
I submitted bug 274036 for the Mac OS X issue.
