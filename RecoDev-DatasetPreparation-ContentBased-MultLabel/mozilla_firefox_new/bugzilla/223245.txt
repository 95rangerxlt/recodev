When surfing to http://www.ocremix.org/ firebird crashes. If you turn off
javascript the site loads correctly.
The problem turned up with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031021 Firebird/0.7+
Former builds load the site ok, so does the official firebird 0.7

I can see that you're using a nightly build, could you please try a current
nightly build, it could be the same problem as bug 223064, try 20031024 when it
comes out, because 22 and 23 have annoying cut/copy/paste problem.
WORKS FOR ME, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a)
Gecko/20031024 Firebird/0.7+ (aebrahim)
Now the site can't be accessed anymore.
It gives 
ERROR
The requested URL could not be retrieved

While trying to retrieve the URL:
NONE://10.1.1.12:80http://www.ocremix.org/index.php

The following error was encountered:

    * Zero Sized Reply 

Squid did not receive any data for this request.

Your cache administrator is root.

Maybe this bug should be closed as it worked for Oleg. It might be fixed already.
Last status report on this bug:
Now the site was up again and WFM.

Tnx to whoever fixed (the duplicate?) of this bug.
