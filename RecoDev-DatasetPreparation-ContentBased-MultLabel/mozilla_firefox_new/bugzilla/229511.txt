I discovered this while viewing the aforementioned page. After dissecting the
HTML it boiled down to <embed type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin">. It's this
special MIME type, if I edit it a bit Firebird doesn't crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new HTML file.
2. Put <embed type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin"> in it.
3. View the page with Firebird.
4. Experience a crash.
Actual Results:  
Firebird crashed, Windows asked me to debug it.

Expected Results:  
Don't crash. ;)

I know it's filed for firebird. Just a datapoint, it works for me (mozilla
1.6b). Can you try a recent build?

WFM, Gecko/20031226 Firebird/0.7+, Win XP
OK, it was a problem with the Plugin. Re-installed it and now it works. Sorry
for bothering you.


Crash if page contains <embed type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin">
