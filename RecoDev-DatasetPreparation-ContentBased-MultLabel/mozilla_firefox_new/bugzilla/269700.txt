In toolbar customization select 'Text only'. Now you no longer see the small
arrows right aside the 'Back' and 'Forward' button. They only appear in 'Icon'
and 'Text and Icon' mode.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. View - Toolbars - Customize
2. Select: Show: Text


Actual Results:  
Drop down arrows disappear.

Expected Results:  
Drop down arrows should stay as before.

Reassigning to Kevin.
Kevin, this makes the text-only toolbar mode a lot less usable, than the
different icon modes.
This seems to be a trunk-only thing. It works as expected on the branch and with
the 1.0 final.

Patch v1

Ok, here's a patch. I took it from bug 257480 which this bug may be considered
a duplicate of. But I don't like these be-all-end-all bugs and would prefer it
to keep this in a separate bug.
CC'ing Kevin again, now that I took the bug.

Patch v1

Kevin, I would appreciate your review here.
shouldn't this wait until after the giant merge from hell?  One less potential
conflict...
Mike, I thought that this would be part of the "giant merge from hell" as you
call it. And since this is a small and independent change, I think it would be
easier to do it separately.

But if you do not agree, feel free to dupe this bug against bug 257480.
Fixed by Ben's great aviary merging today.


'Text only' drop down menus are missing for 'Back' and 'Forward' on the trunk.
