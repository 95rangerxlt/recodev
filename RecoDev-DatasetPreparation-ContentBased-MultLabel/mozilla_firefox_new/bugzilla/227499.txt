After opening image-files on multiple tabs, then going to the first tab that has
image, using save as, either by ctrl-s or using the menu with right click on the
image, application loses focus. None of the keyboard shortcuts work properly -
it's not possible to close the tab with ctrl-w. It's possible to close the tab
with mouse, but the focus still doesn't return and allow using ctrl-s for
opening save as dialog in the next tab, AND using right click menu on the image
simply doesn't work. It's not possible to save the image using File -> save as
either. Simply put, no dialog window opens at all. It is possible to save the
image using Tools -> page info -> media and selecting the image and saving it
from there. Other solution is to focus some other window and then return using
Firebird. I'm seeing this behaviour on KDE 3.1, Fluxbox 0.1.14, but not in
Windowmaker. Only difference between these is that I know that only Windowmaker
supports the real "Focus Follows Mouse" -type focus, the others only do the
"Sloppy Focus". So in a way this is not strictly a Firebird bug, but problem
with "Sloppy Focus"; but considering this wasn't happening with Firebird version
0.5 at all, there must have been some changes how Firebird reacts with the focus
(I first spotted this behaviour sometime between version 0.5 and 0.6). This sort
of behaviour DOES NOT occur using "Click to Focus" -type focus at all. Some
parts of this behaviour are always reproducible, like the second tab save as
dialog not appearing; sometimes the application gets the focus after closing the
first save as dialog, so it's possible to close the tab with ctrl-w, but
sometimes it is not. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open images to multiple tabs (Make sure you have sloppy focus set in your WM)
2. save the image in first tab, then try to close the tab with ctrl-w, then
close the window with mouse (sometimes this works, sometimes not)
3. Goto next tab, try to save the image with CTRL-S or using any other method
than Tools->Page Info->Media

Actual Results:  
Firebird doesn't respond to keyboard-shortcuts anymore, or right-click mouse
button menu, and it's not possible to save the image using File->save as because
the save as dialog doesn't appear anywhere.

Expected Results:  
Show save as dialog, respond to keyboard shortcuts.

This behaviour has been spotted in many recent versions of Firebird, including
the one I'm currently using which was built from Gentoo-ebuild. Nevertheless,
it's been happening in many nightlies, and at least in 0.6 version too, which
have been downloaded from mozilla.org ftp -site as binary packages.

with "multiple tabs" I guess you mean 5 or more, not just 2-3?
Did you encounter this bug with a more recent FireFox build?

It did happen with 2 tabs too. I have not seen this bug in 0.8.* or 0.9.* -> fixed
