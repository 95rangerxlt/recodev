description:
each of the SUs has got another username/password combo with standard auth
procedure (apache 1.3.x). while requesting SU1 and entering the site, which
works well, and then klicking a link to request SU2, firefox doesn't display the
page. it even does not ask for password any longer.

there is no difference whether i saved passwords or not, wether i clear the
options saved passwords or not.

sometimes, firefox reconeects to SU2 all the time again, you can see this in the
status bar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. setup apache
2. create 3 htaccess file and 3 htpasswd files and place them in three different
directories. all username/pass combos should be different.
3. create a html file containing links to the other 2 directories and place it
in the first directory
4. request this html page and enter your username and password
5. click a link to display one of the 2 other directories.

Actual Results:  
the page does not show up

Expected Results:  
firefox should ask for username and password and then display the page after
entering the correct username and password.

in some rare occasions, firefox will not stop to ask for username and password.
even if you enter the correct one, firefox will continue to ask for username and
password.

for me this looks like a complete mess. no offence please.
