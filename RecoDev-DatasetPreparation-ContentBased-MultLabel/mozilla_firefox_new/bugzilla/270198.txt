ok, the problem was on my side - the divs under consideration had only their 
id attribute set, not the name. JavaScript's getElementById() appears to use 
the name attribute, while IE's all array works with the id attribute. I forgot 
to take this in ato account.


Switching display style of stacked DIVs on and off does not work.
