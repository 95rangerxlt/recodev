In the context menu for an inactive area of an image map where no area element
has specied a region, selecting Properties does not display the properties
dialog for the image.  Selecting Properties for an active area, or an inactive
area within a region specifed by an area element, does brings up the properties
for the link as expected.  This only applies to Firefox, it does not apply to
Mozilla 1.8a3.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the test URL provided
2. In area 4, select properties from the context menu

Actual Results:  
No properties dialog displayed

Expected Results:  
The properties should display for all regions as it does in Mozilla 1.8a3

Confirming

this should be a dupe of a fixed bug on trunk, but I can't find it (in
Browser/Firefox).

setting ->NEW
Note that not only properties but ANY menu item is unisable, and that the
imagemap context menu is always the last valid context menu sown (ie the last
menu shown on any other item)

Try this:
1) Select some plain text (no links) ad rigth-click: a very short menu should appear
2) Rigth-click on the imagemap: the same menu should be shown

fix

The properties dialog is not displayed because there's a javascript error.

The lines of code I'm removing with my patch were useless because when the
click is done on an active part of the image map, this.target.localName
contains "AREA". It contains "IMG" only when there's no link.

Right, we shouldn't get to this point (and we actually hit a JS error if we
try).
fix checked in, thanks db48x
