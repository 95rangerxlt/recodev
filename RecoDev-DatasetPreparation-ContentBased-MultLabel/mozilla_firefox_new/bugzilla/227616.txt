At the url above when you click on one of the links prefixed with "Part xx:
xxx", a RealPlayer soundtrack stream starts playing. When I click on the link in
the popup window called "Unfiltered Player" sometimes Firebird crashes. In the
JavaScript console I get the following.

 Error: Newwin has no properties

Line 7

I don't know why it crashes. It does not do at every time. It may be that it
only  crashes when RealOne Player is already open.
I have Firebird set so it will automatically open the files there in RealOne Player.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the url and click on one of the links to play a part.
2. Click on the link titled Unfiltered Player in the popup window.
3.
Actual Results:  
Firebird crashed.

Expected Results:  
Kept on with it.

I always close the popup windows as soon as I click on Unfiltered Player and the
file opens in RealOne Player.
I like to play it in the player rather than the window with no controls.

Apparently reproducible using Firebird/2003-12-06-02-trunk.

1. Access the URL in Firebird
2. Click "Part 1: World at War"
3. (Dismiss blocked pop-up alert if necessary)
4. Click "Unfiltered Player"
5. (If "Opening" handler dialog shown, choose to always open file type using
RealPlayer, close all spawned windows and start again at step 1)
6. Return to Firebird from RealPlayer, close blank window, then "Left Behind
Dramatic Audio" pop-up; Firebird should crash at this point.

Stack to follow.
