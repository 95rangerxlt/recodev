User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031002 Firebird/0.7+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031002 Firebird/0.7+

I run a local apache server, testing a "Hacking game" which I'm developing.
When I go into .htaccess-protected folders, Firebird only asks for
username/password once, and once only, even if the browser is restarted.
Internet Explorer asks for the password once per browser-session, BUT has the
ability to save passwords, which Firebird hasn't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go into a .htaccess-protected folder
2. Enter username and password and click ok
3. Restart the browser
4. Go into the same folder as in 1.

Actual Results:  
The folder loads, without asking for password

Expected Results:  
The ability to click in a checkbox and choose to save passwords, and not saving
username/password automatically everytime.

However, it CAM be the local server, but IE asks for password everytime when you
have left the page and then go in again...

This CAN be a SERIOUS security vulnerability!

Does seem to work sometimes after all...
BUT the bug is still there!
seems to be fixed in last nightly build...
went away on its own, removing security flag


.htaccess-passwords seem to be saved between sessions
