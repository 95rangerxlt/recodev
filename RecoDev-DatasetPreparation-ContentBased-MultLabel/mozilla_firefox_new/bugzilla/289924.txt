Mozilla Firefox is my default browser. Today, it won't open any web pages. 
Internet Explorer will. In Firefox I get message:"www.mozilla.org could not be 
found. Please check name and try again."  I get this same message for my home 
page and any other url I try to reach. Until today, Firefox has been operating 
well.  Since IE is working, it isn't my isp or my computer in general.  Any 
suggestions?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Simply try to open Firefox or attempt to reach any website.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
I get a blank browser page and an Alert box stating, e.g., "www.my.yahoo.com 
could not be found. Please check the name and try again."

Expected Results:  
It should open the web page, as it always has in the past.

Something tells me this isn't Bugzilla's fault. ;)

Moving to the Firefox produt.
Reporter, do you use a firewall, and is it set up to allow firefox.exe access to
the internet?
Norton Personal Firewall 
> reconfigured, without my input, to block Mozilla access to my computer.  
> I've reset NPF and it seems to have cured the problem. 


Mozilla Firefox won't open any web pages today.
