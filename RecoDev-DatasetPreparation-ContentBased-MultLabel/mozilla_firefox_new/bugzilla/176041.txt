The concept of putting platform #ifdefs in DTD files is VERY bad for 
translation.

It means that there will have to be a new translation for each platform, rather 
than sharing translation between unix/windows/OS/2.

We need a better way to do this.

not my fault. :-)
If a string differs between platforms it should be in [lang]-[platform].jar
instead of [lang]-[region].jar

Here is an example we have had to deal with while making the french translation
of Firebird (luckily, Quit and Exit have the same meaning in our case) :
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/locale/browser.dtd#269
One more was checked-in today. For Mac OS X this time, same file.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/locale/browser.dtd#282
I will fix this #ifdef.  Sorry, this did not occur to me until you brought it up.

are there any #ifdeffed .dtd files remaining?
Not sure if there are more, but here is one:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/prefwindow/locale/pref-navigator.dtd#14
I fixed the pref-navigator.dtd one.
It would be good to have the list of the dtd and .properties files that are
prepreprocessed so we could not send them to the PP no matter if they contain
#if or not.
Some of them have a header. So what should be done with them? Can we just strip
the licence, since most of the localized file don't have any?

Pierre: what exactly are you suggesting? I could do with an example.

In general, all new files checked into Mozilla CVS which can support one should
have a tri-license header. Headers certainly shouldn't be removed from files
which have them.

Another new one:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/locale/browser.dtd#42

Do we need 'browser-platform'?
Anbo: I removed the #ifdef, imo there is no need for browser-platform.jar files

Gerv: Most of the localization files (.dtd, .properties) don't have a license.
Also, we use the preprocessor to strip the licences in js, xbl and xul files.

What should we do for the localization files: remove the licence to the very few
that have one, or add a licence to all the localization files that haven't one,
given that this licence won't be shipped because of the preprocessor?
*** Bug 227508 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
to my knowledge, there's no more #ifdef in localized files.
If other #ifdef are discovered, please quickly open a new bug report since it is
critical for localizers.
marking fixed.


#ifdeffing DTD files created translation nightmare
