Under Tools-Options-Privacy, pressing Clear all doesn't clear out the browser's
history, at least as far as the Back button is concerned.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit a few pages
2.Tools-Options-Privacy, press Clear all
3.clikc on the back button

Actual Results:  
browser goes to the page last visited

Expected Results:  
nothing - there should be no page stored to go back to.

The cache is being correctly cleared, as shown by about:cache, and auto-complete
doesn't suggest old pages, but they still appear in the back button drop down.

Yup, i can reproduce this misbehavior on Solaris also with firebird 

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030627 Mozilla
Firebird/0.6

I use Google as my search engine and even after uninstalling and reloading
Mozilla Firebird, when typing in a letter it will still drop down a list of all
previous search inquiries and (unlike IE6) I can't just hit the delete key to
erase those items highlighted.
The only behaviour I see is that after you press the clear all button, the
previous pages you have visited still appear if you click the down arrow next to
the back button.  They do *not* appear in the history window.  Also, I did not
get any problems with my search terms showing up after doing a clear all, either
in the text box at www.google.com, or in the search bar in the browser.
Fixed.
Yup, looks good - thanks very much.


"Clear all" doesn't clear out browser's history
