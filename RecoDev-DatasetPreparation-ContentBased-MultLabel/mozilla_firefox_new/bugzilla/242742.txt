Build Identifier:  2004050508

I have tried the last 3 nightly builds and it's always the same.  Double click 
on icon and Firefox doesn't load.  Looking at mt tasklist, I see 
Firefox 'running' but it never comes up.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click.
2. Wait, nothing happens.
3. Look in task list and see Firefox.exe listed.

Actual Results:  
Nothing, no browser comes up.

Expected Results:  
A browser should come up.

CONFIRMATION

As report said.
Clean install on standard Win98 PC, running since years without problem, no 
virus.
Firefox doesn't start. Shows in Tasks List.
When killing it, message "This program stopped to respond".

SAME PROBLEM with MOZILLA !

You can see this with some dodgy plugins.  Have you tried deleting all of the
prog. driectory and doing a clean install?
Yes I did a clean install.  I don't have any plugins installed.
Is this still an issue?
There is no more a problem with some installations of Windows'98 since Firefox
0.9 and Mozilla 1.7.
I think it can be changed to FIXED.
Daniel
The masses have voted.  I'm marking to fixed as I have used Firefox on my second
PC which is win98 and it works fine.


Firefox will not start.
