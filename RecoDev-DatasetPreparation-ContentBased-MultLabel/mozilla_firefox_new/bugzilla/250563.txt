This also happens in all "exception" lists in the new "web features" options tab.

So, this could either be a post 20040707 regression, or a Windows XP bug, I will
test 20040709 soon.
Possibly broken because of the changes in the "web features" options?
Weird. I downloaded a tinderbox build with the product version of firefox.exe =
1.7: 2004071202 and this bug's gone. Can somebody verify this?

Please, can somebody confirm this bug does not happen anymore?
It does not seem to happen anymore here.
I just removed a couple of sites from the exceptions list and did not see any
weirdness around the scroll bar.

I'm marking this as fixed since it obiously does not happen anymore. 
But feel free to reopen it if it occurs again.
unsetting blocker status for this since it appears from the comments to no
longer be a blocker.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


After removing sites from "exceptions" list in cookies settings or the new "web features" options, the scrollbar resizes incorrectly.
