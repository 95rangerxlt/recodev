So, I've been using it for a while in b3pre, and I haven't had *any* issues with it.
I guess we should have an editor review it on 3.0 and go from there?
There were actually a few issues that needed fixing for Firefox 3, but I think I have them all resolved now and am currently testing it against Firefox 3 Beta 2.

My plan was to make sure that everything looked good once Beta 3 was released and then release the new version then.
hi chris,

beta 4 should go out next week some time.  think web developer might be ready for the surge in updates that might happen when beta 4 goes out?

hello again chris... just checking in again. We're releaseing beta 4 soon, so now would be a good time to push to AMO and test out on beta testers. Let me know if you need any help.
Hi Chris, thanks for your work on this gem!  I just wanted to offer to help test it for expected behavior when you've got this close to ready.  I've used web developer extensively for a long time now and will be willing to give it a good look if it would help you get this done.
hight priority ... need for testing faults in web pages,,,om FF3

Still says "not compatible" when I try to install it on an FF3 nightly (3.0b5pre)

should be compat with beta5 pre now.
This is broken after beta5 because of patch for bug 292789
time to get this updated again! AMO support 3.0.* maxVer. Should be able to test off the latest nightlies.
I've updated the extension and marked it with 3.0.* support.
