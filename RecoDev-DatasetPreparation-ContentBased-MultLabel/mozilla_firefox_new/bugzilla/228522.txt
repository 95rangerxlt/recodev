In all cases where scrolling is needed (such as browsing webpages or in
Firebird's options) there is no scrollbar.  I am able to use my mouse's
scrolling button and highlight text to scroll up and down... but otherwise there
is no bar.

I couldn't find another problem reported in a quick search... so sorry if this
is repeated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird
2. Go to a webpage longer then one screen

1. Go to tools
2. Go to options
3. Go to advanced, when the tree is fully visible there is no scrollbar.

Actual Results:  
no scrollbar appears.

Expected Results:  
insterted a scrollbar when one is needed.

i just reinstalled firebird and found the problem to be fixed... it must have
just been a faulty install instance.  sorry.
