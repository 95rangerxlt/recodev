And replace (aTab == this.selectedTab) with aTab.selected. .selectedTab getter seems more expensive than .mCurrentTab.

The tab.selected changes are fine, but we should make selectedTab fast rather than using mCurrentTab.
So maybe selectedTab getter could return mCurrentTab directly, and use tabContainer.selectedItem instead when necessary?
This sounds reasonable.
