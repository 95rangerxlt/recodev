Rubenium,

Please try downloading a newer build of Firebird, as a lot has changed since the
build you are using.  You can get the latest build here:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/nightly/latest-trunk/

There are some good instructions available on how to get java to install
correctly here:

http://texturizer.net/firebird/faq.html#q2.2

Can someone with enough privileges please close this.  Rubenium, please re-open
if you have followed the instructions and are still having problems.
