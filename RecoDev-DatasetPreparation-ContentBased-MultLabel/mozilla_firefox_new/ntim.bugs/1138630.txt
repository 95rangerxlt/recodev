... because it still doesn't really look good on Windows.

The way to do this would be to set the badge to " " and style the badge element to have a background image in addition to the background color we already set on it.

Stephen, can you provide an image?

John, would you be interested in taking this bug? :-)

Sure I can do this. Once Stephen supplies the image, I can get the patch created and submitted on here for review.

This SVG seems to render sharp in Firefox (on Windows, at 1x size, in the browser area). But I'm not sure how that looks on the update badge.

Why can't you use the SVG file as content here? (you can use an image as content, and it'll nip a layout warning + inefficiency in the bud)

The SVG file has a size, why do we need to re-specify it here?

Why inline-block and not just block?

This still needed the height to be sized appropriately, I take it? If not, please get rid of that, too.
