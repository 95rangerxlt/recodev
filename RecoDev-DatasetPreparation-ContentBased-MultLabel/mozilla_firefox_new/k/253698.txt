Go to "Bookmarks" menu
1.Rightclick on a "live bookmark folder" , "Open in Tabs" is missing.
2.In the folder it self the "Open in Tabs" at the bottom is missing
3.Middleclick on the "live bookmark folder" does not open the live bookmarks in
tabs.

A fix before 1.0 would be nice so the normal folders and live bookmark folders
hav the same behaviour.

As I told vlad, I don't know if this is a "should implement" or not.  I'll
leave that up to the devs.

This patch also adds bm_expandfolder to the Livemark command list, to make it
more consistent with Folders.

Let's see if we can get a decision on this menu item.

I'm not convinced of its utility from a RSS-reading perspective, but it should
definitely be there for publishing bookmarks and the like.

Open in tabs in the folder with bookmarks (at the bottom) itself is still missing.




forget comment 6 .
Somehow it did not show the first time (livemark was still loading)

Confirming all works
