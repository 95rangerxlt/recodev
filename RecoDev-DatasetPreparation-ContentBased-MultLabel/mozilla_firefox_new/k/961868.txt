We can't set the isAppTab property on the docshell in electrolysis. Eventually we may want to send a message to update this attribute in the child. However, we only ever use the isAppTab property when calling nsIWebBrowserChrome3::OnBeforeLinkTraversal, and that function is also unimplemented in electrolysis. So it doesn't seem worth it to do that now. I filed bug 961867 to deal with app tabs.
