Bug 808215 introduced the following blocks to MozSocialAPI.jsm:

+#ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
+XPCOMUtils.defineLazyModuleGetter(this, "PrivateBrowsingUtils", "resource://gre/modules/PrivateBrowsingUtils.jsm");
+#endif

...
-    if (!window)
+    if (!window
+#ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
+        || !PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate(window)
+#endif
+       )

These were wrong - the last change should have read:

+#ifdef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
+        || PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate(window)
+#endif

(Note the negation of *both* the #if and the result of isWindowPrivate) as the intention was to continue injecting in non-per-window builds, but prevent injecting in per-window builds.  There is also one further similar problem later in the file relating to chat windows.

The end result of this is that:

* trunk has had the check removed when all the MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING was ripped out.  While this is benign (as none of the social UI elements are created anyway), the check should be re-added to trunk for the sake of being extra-careful.

* Builds on the birch tree (basically Aurora but without per-window PB) are currently broken due to most tests failing - we do not inject when we should.

Attaching 2 different patches to address this.

Fix for aurora

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): 808215
User impact if declined: Social features broken in non-perwindow PB builds
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): this is an aurora only patch
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Risks are small and limited to social.  The code only has an impact if per-window PB is disabled later in the release cycle (ie, currently the problem this patch fixes can only be observed on the "birch" branch.
