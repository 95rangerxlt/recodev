GCLI commands in Firefox could do with some updates:
* All uses of createPromise should be updated to createDeferred (i.e. bug 792815)
* Many of the comments in BuiltinCommands are wonky
* When converters has landed (bug 657595) then separate the data from the formatting

Having done this we should consider removing the deprecated createPromise method from ExecutionContext.

Thanks. Will land.

This was trivia, and probably not worth wasting time on. BuiltinCommands.jsm has lots of comments in the form

    /*
    *
    */

Where everywhere else, we do

    /*
     *
     */

Most of the comments are useful in BuiltinCommands.jsm are only for fast visual navigation when you don't know what to search for, but that can be useful in files with random collections of stuff like this.

It does now. Previously we did some minor content detection.

I think we should be explicit whenever the return type isn't "string". I also think that "html" is unlikely to be right. "dom" is more likely. I'm surprised that "html" even works.

I'm happy to do it. I need to make sure that other projects like Orion/Ace are not using it too.
Sounds easy enough to do all this stuff (minus blowing away createPromise). Can I get this assigned?
This has mostly been fixed bit, by bit. Closing as no longer useful.
