Wrong bug, sorry.
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/24fda7c805e3
Backed out in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/7a7ba4d11e5e because either this or bug 962736 (or much less likely one of the other patches Ryan pushed with them) permanently broke xperf tests on Win7:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=33488315&tree=Fx-Team
The backout went green, so it was one of these two patches that broke it.
Am I correct in assuming that the text in comment 6 was copy-pasted from the other suspected bug, and that this bug is, indeed, the much less likely candidate? The error doesn't look like something this patch could conceivably have caused.

Ugh, yeah, sorry, it was copy/pasted from bug 960051. The two much-less likely patches I was talking about were Android-only or a three-line change to a CSS file, neither of which seemed like it would make Windows tests access those three files.

Since my backout turned it green, either Shumway's update in this bug or pdf.js's update in 960051 caused it.
In that case, my money is on bug 960051: it has password prompting-related changes, so changed patterns of key storage accesses seem to make sense.

The update here, OTOH, is really unlikely to be related.
Sounds plausible to me.

This did cause the xperf regression. Backed out.
