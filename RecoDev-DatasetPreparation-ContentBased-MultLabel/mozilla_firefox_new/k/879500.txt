1. Remove lots of things from the panel.
2. Open the help/bookmarks/history subview

ER:
You can see + click all the items.

You cannot see + click all the items.

Note it's also true the other way : there is a lot of lost space when your default panel is big and you open the help subview for example.
Taking this one to Australis M7
Removing the items from M7 that do not block us from landing on m-c.
This is caused by the panel getting a height attribute set somehow. Removing that seems to make this work correctly. Honestly not sure how that's happening from looking at our code. It might be the panel setting it?
Can anyone still reproduce this on Windows? I still see this on OS X, but mconley said it's gone on Windows.
So this is still not working quite correctly on OS X (possibly retina-only?) because panels get auto-resized when OS X moves stuff around. See also eg. bug 852775. This is also causing a slight centering issue when the parent window is flush with the right window edge - the panel gets moved onscreen and becomes a bit narrower, leading to a larger right margin than left margin (as the panelview gets slightly cut off).

Mark pointed out in bug 874792 that this is possibly incorrect. I've been trying to debug it on a debug build to see what's going on, but without much success (in part because switching to your debugger fires new events and makes the panel not appear and all sorts of funny things like that - I guess I should just dump debug, but I haven't had the time to do that yet).

I *have* noticed that sometimes the panel is cut off, but when I set noautohide to do some DOMI inspecting on it it seemed to just be moved slightly, rather than resized? I haven't managed to figure out why this is, and/or if it's related to the noautohide or something else.
I can't reproduce this anymore, and am fairly sure this was fixed by bug 892994.


Subviews should resize to fit contents
