Per mconnor's blog post (http://steelgryphon.com/blog/?p=81), removing approval
request until patch has landed on the trunk, has baked, and has
justification for landing on the branch for beta1.

Looks like this has bitrotted from the checkin for bug 338429.  Simon, can you post an updated patch?

Notes for drivers considering the approval1.8.1 request:

This patch has just landed on the trunk, but letting it bake for a couple days won't help test it, because it's specific to the old bookmarks code, which is disabled on the trunk.

This patch addresses a bug that can cripple microsummary service functionality in the rare event that the user has removed her bookmarks toolbar.  There is virtually no risk to the bug, as it merely adds a check to make sure an object exists before calling one of its methods.


MicrosummaryService fails if the Bookmarks Toolbar was removed
