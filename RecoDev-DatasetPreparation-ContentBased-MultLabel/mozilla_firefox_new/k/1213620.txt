Build ID: 20151009030230

Steps to reproduce:

Trying to access DownloadsButton or window.DownloadsButton, from within an extensions XUL overlay, is undefined.

This prevents extension from interacting with the download panel anchor. For example, Status4Evar uses DownloadsButton to conditionally swap out the panel's anchor, which is not possible using DownloadsIndicatorView if "downloads-button" isn't on a toolbar.

Other components of the download button/indicator/panel use XPCOMUtils.defineConstant or similar, but DownloadsButton does not.

Fancy creating a patch?

I suppose there's a first time for everything. I verified this my modifying my local omni.js instead of compiling, so hopefully that's sufficient.

DownloadsButton defined as const so extensions can't access it
