Fedora/Gtk3/Dark theme

Dark theme in Gtk3 means that system uses white text on black background. On the preferences pannel (about:preferences), highlighted texts (on mouse over) are rendered by white color on white background. 

moz-buttonhovertext is used for the highlighted text color. Other colors seems to be hardcoded. I expect we should also hardcode the color for selected item.

Sorry, but I'm not sure about this change either, redirecting to Gijs who may have a more solid opinion on it.

What is this patch actually trying to do? Just adjust the text color of the labels of hovered radio items? Where is the rule that is setting this to begin with? You're updating the hover color for the entire radio checkmark tree. Is that really necessary?

New rules should be specific to the case in question, and ideally linux-only (use http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/linux/global/in-content/common.css instead of common.inc.css, unless the problem is the same on Windows with dark themes, or something (seems unlikely, but possible)).
The origin is here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/linux/global/checkbox.css#81

81 checkbox:not([disabled="true"]):hover {
82   color: -moz-buttonhovertext;
83   text-shadow: none;
84 }

where -moz-buttonhovertext is white on dark color themes so we need a fixed color for this. This bug affects Linux only.

What about this one? It uses the same color for normal/hovered text color (like on Windows).

Please make this one rule (ie combine the selectors) and append it after the other radio rules, and add a comment before it explaining why we need to do this.
