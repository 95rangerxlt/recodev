Not super important, but it should help with bugs similar to bug 892955.

getPlacementOfWidget should return null for non-existent widgets

So, something like this would probably work...

... except, of course, it'll return null for lazily loaded areas like the panel if they haven't been constructed yet.

I'm wondering if this is worth the trouble. Blair, what do you think? :-(

On second thought, why don't we make it behave that way just for API-based widgets? That's more foolproof and that way we don't break anyone's expectations, and still avoid the original problems.
Yea, that sounds like it should work.

Nit: Got confused by 'aNeedsToExist'. How about something like 'aOnlyRegistered' or 'aExcludeDead' or something ?

widgetExists() doesn't seem to use |area|, so that call doesn't need to be inside the loop. Or did you mean it to use |area|?

Should add a comment here stating the assumption that since it's a XUL widget and we're querying it, we're assuming it exists.

Yeah, the aArea thing was a leftover from my previous iteration. You're right that without it, we can check things immediately.

Of course, testing it should have happened before putting this up... (missing bracket, fixed in this patch) :-\
