I just ran browser_bug581253.js in e10s and it passes.

Can we morph this bug to re-enable the test case?

Seems like the right thing to do.
so this would just be removing the skip-if line in browser.ini, right?

Jim, let's walk through that tomorrow and see if I can check-in the patch.  I have a feeling I didn't do all the hoop jumping a few years back to maintain my check-in rights.  Surely there is a way check if I do or not?
patch (https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/6bb4865b2a3f) passes try https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=6bb4865b2a3f
How about the other tests you found? Lets morph this bug into a more general one and add those too so we can land this all at once.
Ok, I'll get that list together, try a new patch locally. Once I've nailed down which test cases can be re-enabled, I'll push a new patch to try and morph this bug accordingly.

Your summary info isn't complete -

should be something like:

"Bug 1093756: Re-enable several test cases under e10s. r=jimm"

Once that's updated, you can carry forward my r+ and add checkin-needed to the bug.
Also add more detail -

patch with perma-fail testcase skipped on Mac

There was only one testcase enabled here that was causing perma failures on Mac 10.10.  The new patch disables the test case for Mac.  

New try run for Mac 10.10 is green (sorry didn't run it prior to previous patch, I didn't know 10.10 has to be manual selected in the try code generator). https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c7c985f142e1
