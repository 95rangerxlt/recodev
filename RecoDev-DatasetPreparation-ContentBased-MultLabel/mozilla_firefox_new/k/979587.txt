This is definitely improved since bug 973217 landed, but I've still hit it twice in the last day or so and Gijs tells me he has too.

Don't know how/why this is still broken. :-\

Mike and I debugged this, because it's very reproducible on his machine (and not on mine).

Basically what seems to happen is the click event fires before the popupshown event, which means our pointerEvents disabling isn't working.

I have a cunning plan:

0) set style="pointer-events: none" on the popup;
1) remove that in popupshown, and do our current dance. Add an attribute to the popup indicating whether pointer-events should be disabled until the transitionend
2) in popupshowing, check for the attribute and if truthy, disable pointer-events
3) in popupshown, check for the attribute instead of the expensive getComputedStyle checks.

This is still pretty sad but on the upside, it /should/ work.

Ploink.
This still needs a removeProperty call for the case where we don't need to disable the events for the initial show.

Think I forgot the linux case which doesn't have a transition, but this should still work, I think? Please test. :-)

This didn't work at first on Ubuntu, but that's because you need to switch to using this.style.removeProperty when removing pointer-events property. I tried that locally, and it seemed to work just fine.

So r=me with that fixed.

Can just use transitionProp.contains("transform") here.

This needs to be this.style.removeProperty.
