See summary above and steps below

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open to DPa2
2. Go to Tools -> Options -> Privacy tab -> History
3. Click on the history days box in front of the number, so the caret is here:
   ---> |9
4. Enter a letter or symbol now
5. See NaN

***NOTE: When the caret is here ---> 9| and you eneter a letter, it appears but
quickly disappears.  When you have a number like, say, 95, and your caret is
here ---> 9|5, and you enter a letter, this gets rid of the 5, and leaves it
like this: 9|***

Actual Results:  
Showed Nan in the box

Expected Results:  
Disregarded the letter/symbol input

*** Bug 301838 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This is not a dupe as the summaries are different.  I was originally thinking of
grouping them together.
both seem to be the same bug 299580, but that should been fixed 2 weeks ago

patch

This simply checks if the inputted value will spit out an NaN, and if so, 0 is
returned. Else, the input is returned.

ok, I'll live with the hack in privacy.js, but only because the whole function
is a hack

Isn't 301838 a valid issue, or do the history "days" box and the cache "amount"
box share this same code?

The patch covered for both issues.

include declaration for intValue

Somehow I managed to miss declaring intValue in preferences.xml. It didn't
affect the bug, so I'm leaving this as resolved->fixed, but it does spit out a
warning in the js console. This will take care of that.
Checked in followup patch.

NaN appears when entering a letter and/or symbol in the history "days" box
