Currently we have two implementations of makeNicePluginName:
http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=makeNicePluginName&case=true

We should move this to BrowserUtils and make the two locations use that instead:

Georg, sure thing, I'll take this.

Ok, here is the patch. It works fine as far as I know.

I think I have done the module imports correctly, but you will have to check for me.

Cheers

That looks good, did you check that the click-to-play plugin notification and the permissions section in Tools->"Page Info" still get proper plugin names?

Lets make the |var| a |let| while we are here.

Trailing whitespace.
Going by the history of BrowserUtils.jsm [0], Felipe Gomes is good for review here.

Yes, the simplified plugin name appears in those places.
Please run this through Try first so we can make sure it won't break any existing tests :)

Doing a quick test-run locally, this fails because there is no local |pluginTag|. 
Please fix and try running |mach mochitest-browser browser/base/content/test/plugins/|.
