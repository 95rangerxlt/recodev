"nooverflow" is a negative attribute, and it's also awkward with those two o's in there.

Mike de Boer suggestion changing this attribute to "overflows" (which defaults to true if not present).

To fix this bug, you'll need to clone the repository at https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/.

Search for "nooverflow" in the /browser directory to see where it is referenced.
I can help here !

Please change this to:
if (child.getAttribute("overflows") != "false") {
since the overflows attribute is optional and the behavior should default to items being overflowed.

Made the required the changes. This is my first bug and the first patch I uploaded was when I attened a Mozilla BootCamp so there were people there to help me but now back home I am having a bit of problems on with the hg commands and the procedure. Hope this patch is works else please help me !
The new patch doesn't contain any differences from the previous patch.

If you are using patch queues, after you make your changes run `hg qref` to refresh the patch. Then upload the new patch.

If you are not using patch queues, then make sure that your changes are saved before running `hg diff > patch.txt`.
Akshat, if you need any help with using hg or creating patches, you can always ask in #introduction on IRC (irc.mozilla.org).

It's a help channel for new contributors, and there are usually people there who can advise and answer questions. :)
Any update on this? Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

This looks broken, this._onClickChevronron doesn't exist.

Thanks! These changes look good, and they passed all the customizableui tests on my local machine. I'll push it to the UX branch now.

http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/annotate/0e19ff24a086/browser/base/content/browser.js#l2185 also needed to be updated to use 'overflows' but I fixed that for you.

Congratulations on fixing your first bug!
