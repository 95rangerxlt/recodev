The test for this bug.

If you have a result set generated from a RESULTS_AS_TAG_CONTENTS query, then it will not respond to live update actions to add additional items to the query set.  Both outright additions and updates to existing items (such that they now match the query standards) do not work.

I will attach a test for this behavior.  To see the update case, simply comment out the "add" case's checks and re-run.  The test can also be used to test removing an item from the query set via Live Update too.

i don't undestand this
   var options = histsvc.getNewQueryOptions();
   options.sortingMode = options.SORT_BY_TAGS_ASCENDING;
   options.resultType = options.RESULTS_AS_TAG_CONTENTS;

   // Results
   var result = histsvc.executeQuery(query, options);
   var root = result.root;
   root.containerOpen = true;

RESULTS_AS_TAG_CONTENTS requires that the query specify a &folder=TAG_ID
So, the test as it is is invalid because RESULTS_AS_TAG_CONTENTS is a special remapping query, that is on place till we reimplement tags in a saner way.
Adding support for all querying options could be hard till then.
I'm morphing bug to change the test to a basic liveupdate one, discarding advances searchTerms, annotation, ecc options to somewhere in future.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
