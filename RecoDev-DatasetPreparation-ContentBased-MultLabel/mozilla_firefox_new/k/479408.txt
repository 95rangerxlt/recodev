When loading a Japanese Wikipedia page automatically translated to English by Google Translate, I get the following JS error:

Error: browser is null
Source file: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 2583

It happes at the line:

    if (browser.engines) {

In BrowserSearch::addEngine()

Doesn't happen when viewing the Japanese page without tranlsation, or with  translated Japanese Wikipedia pages other than this bug reports URL.

This happens because the page is in a frame, apparently. The search engine discovery code only looks for top-level documents (via getBrowserForDocument()).
The same issue also exists in the Feed handler, except that we've got a null check there with the comment // ??? this really shouldn't happen..

What to fix: Both handlers or getBrowserForDocument?
If you plan on making discovery of feeds in frames work, I think that'll be the fourth change in our behavior for that without having ever made an explicit decision about how-and-whether (though on the upside, it would be the first *intentional* change) - there's a bug, possibly currently WFM, where Jesse and I had a desultory conversation about the implications.

That's bug 305472, thanks for the note. Considering the discussion in that bug, I'll stick to updating the comment.

fix and test
Don't the arguments in bug 305472 comment 4 equally apply to search engines? Not sure why they should differ from feeds in this respect.
The main difference is that search engines are not as intimately tied to the address bar as the feed icon is.
What's that do for data:text/html,<iframe src="http://developer.mozilla.org/"></iframe> when you follow one of the external links to somewhere without a search engine? (And even if it does happen to do the right thing and remove the discovered engine, given our penchant for breaking that, a test would be a good thing).

Do we support discovering multiple engines at once? What happens if the framing document (or even a frameset document) has a search engine and a framed document does too (or multiple framed documents do)? Whoever loads slowest wins?

Right, let's just fix the error, then.

The wrong thing. :-(

> Do we support discovering multiple engines at once?

We do, as long as they've got different titles.

> Whoever loads slowest wins?

First come, first serve.
