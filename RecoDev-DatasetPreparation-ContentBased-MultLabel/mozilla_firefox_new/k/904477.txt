As reported in bug 902866 we are missing a couple of error handlers when using promises, let's fix that. Here's what we need to do:

--> SessionStore.jsm
 + SessionStore.init() calls gSessionStartup.onceInitialized.then()
   http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3d20597e0a07/browser/components/sessionstore/src/SessionStore.jsm#l390
 + SessionStore._saveStateObject() calls _SessionFile.write()
   http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3d20597e0a07/browser/components/sessionstore/src/SessionStore.jsm#l3775

--> nsSessionStartup.js
 + nsSessionStartup.init() calls _SessionFile.read()
   http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3d20597e0a07/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStartup.js#l83


In order to fix this we need to pass Cu.reportError to .then() to convert calls like this:

> _SessionFile.read(() => next());

to this:

> _SessionFile.read(() => next(), Cu.reportError);

Awww, shoot. The examples at the bottom should have been:

> _SessionFile.read().then(() => next());

and:

> _SessionFile.read().then(() => next(), Cu.reportError);
Is this issue obsoleted? Seems like an easy first bug to fix.
i am interested to solve this as my first bug.How do i go about this thanks in advance.
Sorry for the late response here, this slipped off my radar. Thanks for your interest in fixing this however!

comment #0 describes the three files that need to be fixed and what needs to be done. If any of you wants to take this I can assign the bug to you.
IPlease assign the ticket to me and I will try to fix this tonight between 500 UTC and 1000 UTC as my first fix.
No hurry! It's yours now :)

Some of the areas you had mentioned changed since the report, so I grepped the directory for `.then(` calls and added `Cu.reportError` everywhere a `function onError` wasn't already provided. Some calls were not using using arrow functions as in the example, I'm mostly confident this is fine but if it's explicitly just those instances I can re-patch this.

Thank you and sorry for the changes that happened in between. This looks good if we remove the one thing mentioned below.

No need to add an error handler here, we expect the caller to do that. See your change to nsSessionStartup.js.

Thanks a lot, Brian! Sorry for the review delay, I was out for a couple of days.

Can you please prepare your patch for checkin-needed and mark it as such?

I believe this patch follows all the steps on the wiki[1] for checking in a patch. Let me know if this isn't the correct format and I will revise it.

Thanks!

Brian, the patch looks good but it's missing a tiny thing. Can you please add the reviewer's handle to the end of the patch description? Like so:

Thanks for the patch, Brian! In the future, you can just use the checkin-needed bug keyword for your request. The checkin? flag is more intended for situations where there are multiple patches that aren't all landing at the same time.

Thanks Tim and Ryan. I'll take better note of the process here for the next one!

No worries, the process is something we all had to get used to :) Thank you for your contribution!
