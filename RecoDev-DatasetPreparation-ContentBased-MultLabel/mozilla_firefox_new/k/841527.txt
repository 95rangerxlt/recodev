Using TelemetryStopwatch will reduce code duplication that the FX_IDENTITY_POPUP_OPEN_MS probe handles itself.

See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/ident?i=TelemetryStopwatch for usages of TelemetryStopwatch.

There may be other probes that can be converted. I'll add them to this bug if I find them before the bug is closed.

I think we can remove the Component.utils.reportError call now and just make the TelemetryStopwatch.finish call outside of an if-statement.

Hi there, thanks for the patch! There's just one thing that needs to be addressed before it's ready. With TelemetryStopwatch you can't have a timer that is started but never finishes. If that happens, the next time the timer is started again it will give an error. You have two alternatives to fix that:

- You can move the start of the timer after the return statements that might stop that function, or
- You can call TelemetryStopwatch.cancel(..) before the return statements to cancel that timer and allow a new one to be started later
