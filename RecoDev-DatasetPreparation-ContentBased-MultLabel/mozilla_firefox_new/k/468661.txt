currently compatible with 3.1a2pre.  It would be great to see this one moved up to recent versions of 3.1.

Kongkeat, any updates on when updates might be available.  Mark, also cc'ed you since you were helpful tracking down status for 3.0.

made it to b2.
I had some heard time to cross the border of b2 ot b3, really tough. In my case the base was the Mac OSX so new XBl code was landed to make a dragrable function against the toolbar. I had to remove that code. Also the Tabs changed a lot. 

Right now my build process picks the up to date chrome files and then I concatenated lots of CSS rules at the bottom. This was the best way for me to keep in sync with a recent trunk. 

I also overlay lots of existing PNG images ( about 100 or more )
Works for me - addon has been updated for Firefox 3.6.


Noia 2.0 (eXtreme) addon not available/working for Firefox 3.5
