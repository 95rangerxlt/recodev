STR:
1. Go to http://www.mozilla.org/
2. Open: Page Info > Media
3. Select two images from the list
4. De-select one of the two selected images

Actual Results:
Preview shows the image that was de-selected.

Expected Results:
Preview shows the image that remained selected.

Basically the problem is that the code uses tree.selection.currentIndex, which gives the cursor row, not the selected row.

Patch removes all uses of .currentIndex. I left getSelectedImage() in place even though it's not used anymore.

On second thought, it's better to remove the unused getSelectedImage().

It looks like the only case that actually needs a selected row index is the else branch, when count == 1.  getSelectedRows is O(n), n = number of rows in the tree, which means you're always doing O(n) work when at most you only need O(1) work, in the else branch.  So I think you should keep the var count definition from the original code and call getSelectedRow (or use getSelectedRows()[0]) for the makePreview argument.

(Now, maybe it's the case that tree.view.selection.count is O(n) too, I don't know offhand, but that's no reason for unnecessary O(n) work here.)

Please make that change before landing, or let me know if I'm not seeing some problem with what I've said.
