The new search bar seems to be unable to add some engines: If I am browsing a website offering a search (e.g. http://www.reichelt.de/) and I click in the Firefox search field → "Add …", nothing may happen, resulting in the following message found in the Browser Console:

Error invoking addEngine install callback: [Exception... "JavaScript component does not have a method named: "onError"'JavaScript component does not have a method named: "onError"' when calling method: [nsISearchInstallCallback::onError]"  nsresult: "0x80570030 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JSOBJECT_HAS_NO_FUNCTION_NAMED)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/components/nsSearchService.js :: SRCH_SVC_addEngine/engine._installCallback :: line 3968"  data: no]

Adding Bugzilla@Mozilla works, so it seems to be a problem somewhere between Firefox search and the providers search, that should be reported more prominently.

Here is the behavior I observed when I tested adding the engine from http://www.reichelt.de/:
- When loading the page, the (+) badge appears, I can add the engine.
- The engine is correctly added to the list of engines, and there's no JS error; however the (+) badge in the searchbox doesn't disappear.
- If I attempt to add the same engine again, I get the JS error quoted in comment 0 (line number is 4126 on my trunk build, but the error is otherwise the same).
Ok, the problem here is that the page offers a search engine with the name "reichelt elektronik Suche", but the installed engine is actually named "reichelt elektronik GmbH & Co. KG Suche".

That's a bug on the website, but also a Firefox bug, already tracked in bug 351441.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 351441 ***
The failure case when we hit bug 351441 shouldn't be the one in comment 0, though. 

We should probably just add an onError to the installCallback defined at https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/643589c3ef94/browser/base/content/urlbarBindings.xml#l1237.
Hi

I would like to work on this bug. Can you please provide me more information.
Thanks in advance

Hi shreyas. Thanks for offering to help out! Do you already have a build environment set up (i.e. have you completed step 1 from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction)?

Once you have that, the change required here is described in comment 3. The relevant code in urlbarBindings.xml makes a call to Services.search.addEngine, whose API is defined here:

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/a6bbabebed2f/netwerk/base/nsIBrowserSearchService.idl#l284

The last parameter there ("callback") is a nsISearchInstallCallback object, which is defined here:

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/a6bbabebed2f/netwerk/base/nsIBrowserSearchService.idl#l219

In the urlbarBindings.xml code mentioned in comment 3, the implementation of nsISearchInstallCallback that is passed to Services.search.addEngine() is missing an "onError" function, which causes the error in comment 0. To remedy that, you just need to add an empty "onError" function (next to the existing "onSuccess") function. It doesn't need to do anything, since we don't care to handle the error case here.

It would be nice to actually make that function report the error using Cu.reportError.

onError function added

onError function added

This looks good, but could you address the feedback from comment 6? Your onError method will need to accept the "errorCode" parameter, and then log an error message including it, something like:

Components.utils.reportError("Error adding search engine: " + errorCode);

Then you should manually test your patch using the steps in comment 1, and confirm that you see the error message you added, and not the one from comment 0. Let me know if that test works for you!

Yes the browser console shows the error message I added.

Thank you!

If you could attach an updated patch with the commit message amended to include "r=gavin", that would be great. No need to re-ask for review.

This seems to be the wrong patch.

I'll push attachment 8555191 with r=gavin added.
