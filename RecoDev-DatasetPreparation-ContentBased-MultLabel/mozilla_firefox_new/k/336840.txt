When the user opens the bookmark properties dialog for a bookmark with a blank or invalid URL (f.e. via the "New Bookmark" command, which actually opens the bookmark properties dialog rather than the add bookmark dialog), the RDF microsummary picker throws errors.  It should instead cope by catching the invalid URL and not attempting to retrieve microsummaries for it.
