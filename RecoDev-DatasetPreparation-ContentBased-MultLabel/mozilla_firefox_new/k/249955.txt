screen shot of theme manager

A button label is blank.
And
oops...

I checked AVIARY_1_0_20040515_BRANCH 7/5 build.

> taking. fix coming up today (probably)

any news? btw, we now have one more blank button: Options (This applies for both
Thunderbird and Firefox)
I have been using the "Mostly crystal" theme

http://tom-cat.com/mozilla/

and it works fine - there are no blank dialog boxes with Mostly Crystal.

also with Pinstripe there are no toolbar icons for some extensions like "Delete
Junk Mail".

I think Mostly Crystal works better than Pinstripe for OS X - less bugs.

it just won't work with the latest 2 nightly builds 20040908.

maybe Mostly Crystal could be used as a default theme with just some sess
colorful color scheme - to make it more OS X compliant

.8 is about to leave the station. Moving to .9
kevin, can you do something? The options button is already ready :)
New icon checked in on Aviary branch
Kevin: The options button is there, the install button is still blank.
(in both managers)
The install icon is there in the most recent Thunderbird-0.8 nightly. I don't
think I'm imagining this :)
soryy, my mistake.

This still needs to make it back into the trunk.

Is the strange spacing intentional?

[install] [uninstall]  [update]  [options] [useTheme]
