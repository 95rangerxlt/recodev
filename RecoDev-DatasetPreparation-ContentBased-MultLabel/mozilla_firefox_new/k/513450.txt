Both in the FF 3.5 and in the current nightly as above, basic keyboard navigation in the media list is broken. You cannot use cursor keys to navigate along the listbox entries to preview them. Which is a complete nuisance in terms of usability when you are looking for a certain image and are forced to click them one by one instead of much more efficient cursoring down. I sometimes wonder how such things can go unnoticed...

Steps
1) Open Tools > Page Info > Media
2) Focus first item of media listbox
3) Try to press cursor down at least twice in a row (!)

Actual results:
After first cursor down, focus automatically shifts to "Save" button, which doesn't help an inch as it's (supposed to be) the default button on that page anyway! Using keyboard navigation only, try getting focus back into the list and preview the next couple of images without banging your head against the wall.

Expected results:
TB should never ever move the focus away from where I placed it, especially not in list boxes with items that cry to be selected/viewed one after the other.
Cursoring up and down the list should just work, as in any other such list.

Works For Me.
works for me - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2a2pre) Gecko/20090828 Namoroka/3.6a2pre
It only works if you use <cursor down> only ONCE. Did you try <cursor down> inside the list two or three times (as in steps), i. e. <cursor down> <cursor down> <cursor down>?

(Obviously, you need a page with several media items.)

You mean with caret browsing enabled; yes indeed this seems broken. It worked with Firefox 3.0.
Must be something fairly recent, last few months. Thomas, are you sure it is also in Firefox 3.5, can you retest? I can't reproduce it with Shiretoko on Windows Vista.

Thanks, Ria, that was the missing bit. But what the * does caret browsing have to do with it??? Weird. Updated summary accordingly.

Oops, no, it's not in Firefox 3.5.2, only in those other nightlies.
Btw, Namoroka, Shiretoko, you name it, what's the best version to use against which to triage bugs, and where can I download it?

don't handle caret browsing commands in chrome windows

This fixes the root cause of the bug. But maybe trees shouldn't be propagating the key events either?

So is this a regression from focus rewrite?

I wish there was nsContentUtils::IsInChromeDocshell(nsIDOMWindow*).
Want to add such? Either way, r=me.

This very same problem still exists (not sure if it was ever really fixed), exactly as described in comment 0. It's a nuisance when you are trying to find the right picture without knowing the name by just cursoring down the list (which doesn't work because of this bug).
The bug only occurs with Caret Browsing ON, and I think in that case there must be some code that deliberately moves the focus to the save button as soon as you cursor down the list of media. Maybe that line needs to be removed.
The bug is not fixed in 1.9.2 but it is fixed on trunk.
