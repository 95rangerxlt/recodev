Spinning this out from bug 1186250. The initial design was to have the window caption button fill the entire height from the navbar to the top of the window (stylistically like Edge). However due to the drag/resize space complications noted in 1186250, that isn't something we can accomplish for Firefox 40.

So, per comments 5-7 there, we should reduce the size of our current caption buttons so they match the normal native size.

Screenshots

I took a number of screenshots at different scaling factors, comparing Firefox (left) to the Win10 settings app (middle) and Edge (right). This is on top of the current patch in bug 1184934.

We're 1 (physical) pixel short of the native size at 150%, but the correct size everywhere else. Given that there are a number of other subtle off-by-one size/position nits with our caption glyphs (due to the rounding issues with scaling, I presume), this seems fine to me. Not noticeable, and a big improvement over where we currently are.

Oops, I meant at 125%.

This actually reduces it by 4px instead of 2px. Is that right? Nonetheless, the screenshots look fine. rs=me

Yep. The original spec (attachment 8636847) had them be 36px tall (2 * 12px margin + 12 px glyph box), which is what was implemented. I'm chopping off 4px to make them 32px tall, which matches the measured size of native apps (see screenshot) and is coincidentally what shorlander says in bug 1186250 comment 7. :)

[Maybe you're thinking of bug 1173731, which is about removing 2px from a different thing?]
