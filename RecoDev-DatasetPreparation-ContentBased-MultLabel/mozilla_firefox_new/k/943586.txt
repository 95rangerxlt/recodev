A patch that implements the second idea of the bug: autocompletion for members of arrays. For example 'list[0][1].' will show autocompletion suggestions for the object [0][1] of list.

The patch contains few basic tests for the functionality. When ran locally the patch causes no new devtools test failures. This only supports numeric indices but I think it can be quite simple extend the support for keyed collections too.
Nice! +1

Thanks for your patch. Great to see someone taking this bug. This is almost working.

When I write myArray['hello'][1] I get suggestions for myArray[1]  - it ignores ['hello'].

Also, instead of adding a new test to the browser/devtools/webconsole folder, can you please write a test in toolkit/devtools/webconsole ? No need to rely on all of the heavy devtools UI - we only care about the input suggestions that are received through the protocol.

This check is too relaxed. How about input like myArray['hello'][1] ? Or myArray[1]['world ' + foo]

Same as above.

webconsole-array-member-autocompletion-v2.patch

Here's a patch that only adds suggestions for (purely) numerical indices and replaces the mochitests of previous patch with xpcshell tests.

I thought about ways to add support for more complex statements but I'm not that familiar with Firefox internals to be able to implement that. So for the patch I decided to limit the autocompletion for numerical indexes only. At least it won't give incorrect suggestions (hopefully). If anyone is interested to extend this, feel free to pick this up.

This doesn't need to be a capturing regex. Please change to /\[\d+\]$/.

split() does more than we need here. Please use indexOf("[") then substr().

This regex doesn't need the /g flag. Also, this regex has an error.

If you write: |myArray[][1].| we can see completion results for myArray[1] because the regex includes the +, it requires something inside the brackets.

Maybe /\[[^\]]*\]/ works.

(please update the test to cover this case as well.)

Thanks for the review. Here's a patch that addresses your comments.

The arrayIndicesRegex actually requires the 'g' modifier, at least according to MDN[1] (doesn't seem to work without it)...

That's an exec() trick I didnt know of. One always learns. Thanks! :)
