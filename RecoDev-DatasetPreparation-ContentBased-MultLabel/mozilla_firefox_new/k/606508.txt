Looking at aboutHome.js in loadSnippets(), it appears that localStorage['snippets-last-update'] will only get updated on a successful snippet fetch (eg. 200 OK)

The problem with this is that any other response code (eg. 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable) will result in repeated requests, rather than waiting until the next day as desired in the load assumptions.

In the case of server failures in particular, repeated requests are not something we want to see.

Barring something more sophisticated like an exponential backoff algorithm, about:home should probably try to update only once per day regardless of success or failure.

seems reasonable, we can batch this change with bug 606320, both involve better management when snippets are invalid.
And yes, I agree we should not bother doing something more clever like retrying in 5 minutes or so, once a day should be fine.
fixed with bug 606320


about:home records last-update time only for a successful snippet fetch
