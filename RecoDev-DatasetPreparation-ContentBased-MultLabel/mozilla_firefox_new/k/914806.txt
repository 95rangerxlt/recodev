The allowedArea code in CustomizableUI.jsm and CustomizableWidgets.jsm is unused and thus dead code. We don't have plans to add the ability to make widgets only allowed in specific areas, so this code can be removed now.

To work on this bug, you'll need to clone the HG repo located at https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/. The files in question are located at /browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm and /browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableWidgets.jsm
