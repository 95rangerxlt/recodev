nsNavHistoryExpire::EraseHistory
nsNavHistoryExpire::EraseFavicons
nsNavHistoryExpire::EraseAnnotations

are generating strings of IDs to delete starting from visit records, since most of place ids and favicon ids could be the same, these functions are generating large lists with many duplicates, and large queries will end up slowing down sqlite

we must avoid adding duplicated items to delete lists
i'm also removing useless spaces, to shrink queries a little

patch coming

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
