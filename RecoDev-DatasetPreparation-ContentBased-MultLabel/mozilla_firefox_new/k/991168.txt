Since bug 956357 landed, the default width of the right pane isn't quite enough for all the buttons, thus the HTML button ends up being bit squished. Increasing the default width will fix this.

This involves changing the devtools.netmonitor.panes-network-details-width pref in firefox.js to something like 550. Super easy good first bug.
Hi i would like to take up this bug 
i have seen the file(mozilla-central/browser/app/profile) and made the change to 550 but unable to see any size change on the width of  network monitor ( i am opening network monitor using ctrl + shift + Q )
Hi! Thanks for the interest. That is the correct change to make.

To see the difference, navigate to a page that requests an html (which is probably easy to find :P) and inspect that request. The pane on the right should be slightly wider, and leave room for all the top buttons.

Please attach a patch and ask for review.
