Christopher,
We are making a big push to try and get as many extensions as possible working for the upcoming release of  Firefox 2 in a few weeks.  Do you know if this extension will be compatible and ready to work with Firefox 2?

I just uploaded a 2.0-compatible version.  I had a compatible version uploaded earlier and awaiting review, but realized that I had left out a newly translated locale.


RSS Ticker extension not available/working for firefox 2
