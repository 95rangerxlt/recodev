Nope, never did work: if you had a console to dump into, http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#4936 would have dumped "*** IMPLEMENT ME"
amazing that this wasn't filed before (ever/anywhere), the more because the UI is allready there (optimists) ;-)
It's implemented in previous builds.  It works fine in the 20060619 nightly of 2.0a3.  Where it isn't implemented is PLACES.  Notice the #ifndef a few lines above that differentiate Places vs non-Places.  

What I don't get is why regular add bookmark works because the addBookmark function a few more lines above looks the same way.  I guess that's implemented elsewhere or just differently in Places.

That would be bug 321973

Here's a simple patch to hook this up.

This code is fine by me.  I'm curious about whether it gets the frame title when the frame has a title?

Some simple testing says that it does (which is good).

Fixed.

/mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js 1.704
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
