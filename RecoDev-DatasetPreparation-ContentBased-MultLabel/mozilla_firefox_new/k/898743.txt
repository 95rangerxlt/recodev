0001-Bug-898743-don-t-thumbnail-non-http-channels-with-a-.patch

I think the problem here is that our data: URL is being captured by the f/g service.  We've fixed that for tests that use the .sjs responses by setting the cache-control header.

This patch checks if a non-http channel still has HTML, and if so, queries for a http-equiv cache-control tag, and if no-store is in that, skips the capture.  This test also adds that tag.

0001-Bug-898743-don-t-thumbnail-non-http-channels-with-a-.patch

adw pointed out on IRC that maybe we should just use the .sjs file in that test too, and avoid adding the extra checks to browser-thumbnail, which is hard to argue with.  I'll wait and see how he goes with bug 901294 as a fix may also come out of that, otherwise I'll do a new patch over the next few days.

As suggested, just use the .sjs file instead of a data: URL for the test that goes orange.

The !simple case returns red and green pages, so please return a white page here (e.g., by not specifying a color at all) so that we don't confuse ourselves when we're debugging problems.  Not to mention, if there's some bug in a test that's expecting a !simple page but it ends up getting the simple page -- such a test should fail cleanly.

simpleCaptureTest says "Create a tab with a red background," but it doesn't actually matter what the background is.
Thanks!  Pushed with comments addressed.

Is this something we should consider backporting to Aurora? Looks like it would need some adapting, though.
