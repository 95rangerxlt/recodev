Remove border.png

Findbar already has no left and right border, so the close button could be easily pressed. However, other panels with close buttons have that border.

I think this screenshot directly refers to this bug. All borders of this panel look ugly and do not match the style - another reason to get rid of them
(I admit that it's possible just to color them black)

Also, I'm surprised there's no Mac version of this (close buttons on Mac are aligned on the left side). And maybe there should also be rtl version (idk). Gijs, you're more experience dev; please have a look.

Mac doesn't generally do Fitts at all, in part because there's no "proper" maximized mode and so the edge of the screen/window just ends up being a resize handle for the window, at all times.
Nikhil, want to give this a shot? You'd want to look at this block:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a1ccea59e254a88f7bb44b0ad8a58b77b7eca339/browser/base/content/browser.css#607-610

and change it as suggested in comment #2, but also use -moz-border-end-width: 0 !important, instead of border-right.

You'd need to rebuild and test that some of the notification bars highlighted in the comments here have the right borders. You can ask me for review or help getting going.

The patch is great, but can you fix the commit message ? It needs to include the bug number at the start, the reviewer's short name (ie me, so "gijs") at the end, and your description says you're switching from "not normal" to "maximized", when in fact you're doing the opposite - and you're making this apply to more notification bars than before. How about:

Sorry. Switched sizemode- maximized and not normal by mistake. Attaching a new patch with the correct message.

Remove 1px border on right side of browser notifications (aka Fitts' law should be applied to all notifications)
