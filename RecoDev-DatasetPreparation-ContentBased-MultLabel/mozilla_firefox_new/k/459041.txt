fix

So instead of clearing out the path (which can throw even for nsIURLs), let's use the prePath instead (which is what we want, anyway), resp. the full URI when the prePath would be trivial/host-less.

Minimally; the test isn't very extensive in itself, I'd rather wait for bug 455070 until extending it to include several domains and edge cases (including failures).
This patch has bitrotted, we need a new patch here.
