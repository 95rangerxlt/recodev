social panels (flyout, status and chat) need an api for closing the panel.  One was implemented for flyouts, it should be updated or verified to work with the panel that is calling the api.

This is related to but not dependent on bug 794640
On IRC, Jaws suggested we just use window.close.  I've a patch which uses the DOMWindowClose event to implement this (no tests and no support for chat windows yet) - but what d'ya reckon?
cool, I would much prefer window.close.  iirc we pass back the window object on any opening api.

Have window.close() close panels and chats

window.close(), when used on a chatbar window or a panel window will close the chat/panel.

Please name this function and remove the event listener.
As discussed on IRC, the listener can't be removed as it might fire multiple times.
