Patch v.1

Essentially undoing gavin's patch from bug 616193.

The CSS for .trademark-label isn't needed, because the theme already twiddles things for #trademark. I'll attach a screenshot after my build finishes.

Looks good to me.

requested modification to trolololo section

I'm a little concerned about the trolololo section, and would ask that the following mod be considered. :) (I keed, I keed, but couldn't resist)

Also, hooray for this bug! \o/

Liz: just in case you're wondering, this change will be in Firefox 12. According to the release calendar (https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar), that will be shipped as a stable version to all our users on 4/24 (or available as a beta on 3/13). [Well, the _actual_ ship dates are a few days later to allow to testing and such.]
thanks
