document it

updates shortcuts.xhtml, tabbed_browsing.xhtml and menu_reference.xhtml
We should probably add this (and other new shortcuts?) to this page: http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/keyboard.
djst, around to do this? If not, I'll get around to it sometime.

Shouldn't that be "&accelKey;+&shiftKey;+<kbd>T</kbd>"?

I don't have a Mac, but I think they use the Cmd key, and &accelKey; will take care of that.
Same thing in shortcuts.xhtml.

I think you are right. XUL says modifiers="accel,shift".

use &accelKey; (see comment #4)
Since you're touching menu_reference.xhtml, can you document History->Recently Closed Tabs as well, please? (I filed bug 343807 for that.)

Full stop after that.

>+  or you can restore all with <span class="menuPath">Open All in Tabs</span>.
"You can restore all tabs by selecting History>Recently Closed Tabs->Open All in Tabs."
(For clarity, use the full menu path).

- the list of tabs is window-speccific (I hope the explanation is clear enough)
- contains Steffen's corrections
- does not change menu_reference.xhtml anymore (see bug #343807)

Press ... to open them one by one in reverse order.

s/Tabs/Tab/, since we're restoring one tab at a time.

This should now be "Closing and Restoring Tabs".

"&brandShortName; windows keep a list of tabs you closed recently."

I'll attach a new patch for checkin in a minute.

Oh, one last nit:

>Index: browser/locales/en-US/chrome/help/menu_reference.xhtml
>+  <h3 id="closed_tabs">Recently Closed Tabs</h3>
>+  <p>Allows you to restore a recently closed tab by selecting it from the list.
"to restore a tab you closed recently in the current window"
