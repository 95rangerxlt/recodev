I am trying to build - without luck - a trunk build of fx.

Source code is up to date, and it is killed while processing nsAuthGSSAPI.cpp

I am using gcc 4.0 (xcode 2.1) with SDK 10.4u under Tiger 10.4.2

My sources are up-to-date at today, 01:00 am, mozilla.org.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Grab sources.
2.Build them using gcc 4.0 (xcode 2.1 version) + SDK 10.4u
3.Wait

Actual Results:  
Build process crashing in processing nsAuthGSSAPI.cpp

Expected Results:  
Ending building process ?

Here is my .mozconfig :

"# sh
# Build configuration script
#
# See http://www.mozilla.org/build/unix.html for build instructions.
#

. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig

# Options for 'configure' (same as command-line options).
ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
ac_add_options --enable-optimize=-O2
ac_add_options --enable-prebinding
ac_add_options --enable-canvas
ac_add_options --disable-shared
ac_add_options --enable-static
ac_add_options --enable-svg

ac_add_options --enable-macos-target=10.4
ac_add_options --enable-strip

mk_add_options MOZ_CO_MODULE="mozilla/tools/update-packaging"

ac_add_options --enable-update-packaging

ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-tests

ac_add_options --disable-pedantic"

I built fx 24 hours before, using the same .mozconfig - and the same tools -
without problem.

Could this bug be related to checkin for bug 303160 ?

This is the only reference to gssapi in the last 24 hours.

I will attach a crash log asap.

Right.	Because what GSSAPI change doesn't cause Mac builds to burn?  :)

So, bug 280792 changed things a bit so that there's now a gssapi.h in the
source tree, and the system's copy (if any) isn't/shouldn't be used.  The
problem is that nsAuthGSSAPI.cpp brings in the system Kerberos headers on Mac
OS X to gain access to KLCacheHasValidTickets, a function specific to the OS X
Kerberos framework, and associated types.

With the current setup, on 10.4 (i.e., with a 10.4 SDK), some parts of the
system's Kerberos headers will be disabled by the in-tree gssapi.h, but enough
remains to really screw up the build.

So, the fix here is to prevent the problem headers from being included. 
Another option would be to add the bits that KLCacheHasValidTickets needs to
the in-tree gssapi.h and never include Kerberos/Kerberos.h.  Neither solution
is optimal.  This is easier now, but will potentially need more maintenance in
the future when Apple changes their Kerberos headers (again).

I haven't tested this with a "standard" 10.2 SDK build, beacuse the only live
tree I've got in that configuration is on the branch, and the dependent patch
didn't land there.
it should be getting gssapi.h from extensions/auth, not from the
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/ path. As I understand it, with the configure.in
changes we've made, it shouldn't be looking in the the sdk at all. Have you done
something special to get that path included in the header include search path?
Adjusting summary and severity - I don't consider it a blocker unless the
tinders are red, even if my own builds are burning (which they are).

Darin's on vacation. I think I'm OK with this change, but Christopher is the
expert...
I will try this patch and see what happens.
Note : before trying the patch, I tried a mozconfig with SDK 10.3.9 and gcc 3.3
-> it crashed at the same point, complaining at nsAuthGSSAPI.cpp :(
Yeah, you'll get similar errors out of the 10.3.9 SDK.  This patch addresses
those too.

I've now tested this in a standard 3.3/10.2.8 environment.
I am using a build with the fix. Let's hope this one won't produce any problem
on other platform :)

If we have more problems in the future we should consider special casing OS X
so it can use its native gssapi.h header file.	Also, if the minimum OS X
version of mozilla is ever upped to Panther we don't need the special OS X call
any more and we can just set the environment variable
KERBEROSLOGIN_NEVER_PROMPT instead.
thx, Mark, fix checked in.
I was going to check in, but thanks for getting it, David.
sorry, I can never remember anymore who has checkin privileges and who doesn't...
