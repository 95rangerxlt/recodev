Windows version that doesn't suffer the blue halo of death.
This was supposed to be fixed as part of bug 1194032 with the code at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/acdb22976ff86539dc10413c5f366e1fb429a680/browser/components/preferences/in-content/sync.js#238 added specifically for this.

0001-Bug-1209204-allow-the-focus-manager-to-select-the-ap.patch

Matt, we discussed this briefly on IRC. Instead of explicitly choosing the control to focus, this patch allows the focus manager to select it using whatever heuristics it uses. On the mac this causes one of the inline links to get focus instead of the button (ie, the same thing that gets focus if you press "tab" while in that "computer name" box.

Change Device Name button keeps focus outline even after pressing cancel on Mac



Bug 1209204 - allow the focus manager to select the appropriate control to focus after editing the computer name in Sync prefs. r=MattN
