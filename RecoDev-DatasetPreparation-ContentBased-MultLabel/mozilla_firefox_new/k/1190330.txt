I know this is the original API, but I'm a bit tempted to just define is/ok/etc. too on top of them since browser.test.assertTrue looks just painfully bloated :( What do you think?
Accidentally landed this with the wrong bug number:
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/91e5acc46643
I'll close this bug out when the other one is closed.
Fabrice, I had to land this with b2g support disabled because of a crash when loading a process script:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=10650232&repo=try
It seems like we're trying to load the process script into a Nuwa process.

Is there any chance you can look into this? It would be nice to have webRequest support on b2g.

I'm working on that in bug 1198970
fwiw, I pushed to try with a b2g implementation of webRequest, and after a Nuwa preloading patch landed (bug 1166207). It seems that we don't crash anymore, but still don't pass.
