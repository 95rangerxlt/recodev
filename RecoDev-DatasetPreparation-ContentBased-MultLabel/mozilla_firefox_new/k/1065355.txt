0002-get-timeline-tests-working-in-e10s-by-disabling-the-.patch

The patch in bug 1067229 plus this attachment gets the timeline tests passing when run under e10s.  Victor, what is the "right" thing to do re the debuggee here?
FTR, the 'shadereditor' tests have an almost identical problem - head.js tries to get a 'debuggee' object in a couple of places but it seems unused by the tests.
Same basic fix for both timeline and shadereditor, so we might as well kill both birds here.

As we discussed on IRC, I've just dropped the "debuggee" result from initShaderEditor() - however, I also changed it to return an object instead of an array so it is easier to add a debuggee back in the future without touching the tests that don't need it.

This gets all timeline tests passing for me locally.

An almost identical patch, but for the shadereditor.
