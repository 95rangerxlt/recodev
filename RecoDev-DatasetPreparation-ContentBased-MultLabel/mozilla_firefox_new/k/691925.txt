gBrowser.selectedBrowser.focus() is more e10s-friendly than window.content.focus(), and should generally be equivalent.

As I understand it, the only difference is whether the windows in question will be raised and/or scrolled to, and in a lot of cases we don't care about that distinction (because the window in question is being interacted with, and therefore is already raised).

content.focus() does two things:

1) it focuses the content area in case some chrome element such as the location bar was previously focused -- gBrowser.selectedBrowser.focus() should be used for this

2) it tells the operating system's window manager to raise the browser window (e.g. if it was minimized or covered by some other window) -- window.focus() should be used for this

We need to decide case-by-case whether we want 1) or 2) or both:

Do you already have a local copy of the Firefox code base? Have you built Firefox?
Yes I am having a local copy of mozilla-central and have also built firefox.
Ok, is commt 1 clear enough? Do you have any specific questions?
I mean comment 1.
Could you please tell me which must be the file/files that need to be edited and also should I replace content.focus() with gBrowser.selectedBrowser.focus() or window.focus() ?
Sorry for the late response, I wasn't CC'd.

Here's the list of files:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=content.focus&find=browser%2F&filter=[+.]content

Can you try to guess for each instance whether it wants to focus the content area (i.e. gBrowser.selectedBrowser.focus()) or raise the window (i.e. window.focus())? It's ok if you get it wrong in some cases, I'll double-check.

This code really wants to focus the content area.

This code wants to focus the content area too.

You need to use w instead of window here. Also, this code wants to both raise the window and focus the content area.

Looks good otherwise.

I did a hg pull -u before applying my patch and some files appeared to be have been modified, but I am confused because I could not see the changes in http://dxr.lanedo.com/mozilla-central, I am submitting the patch with the suggested changes.

Patchv 2.0

It looks like you committed the previous patch before generating this one. You need to revert this commit (via hg strip, for instance) and generate the diff from there.

For future reference, dxr.lanedo.org is no longer being updated. Use mxr.mozilla.org for guaranteed results.

nit: gBrowser is the tabbrowser node itself, so you can just write this.selectedBrowser.focus() here.

This can be simplified to:

  if (window == fm.activeWindow)
    w.focus();
  w.gBrowser.selectedBrowser.focus();

It just occurred to me that the if condition doesn't need to check this.windowToFocus.content anymore.

I'll push this to the try server to make sure this doesn't break any tests.
