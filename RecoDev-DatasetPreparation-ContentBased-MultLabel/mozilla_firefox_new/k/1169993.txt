1. Open the Developer Tools
2. Open browser console.
3. Type following commands to the browser console:
 let { devtools: { require } } = Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/devtools/Loader.jsm", {});
 let { setTheme } = require("devtools/shared/theme");
 setTheme("dark");
 // OR setTheme("light") if you are using the dark theme

Expected results: The theme changes for the active toolboxes.
Actual results: The theme is not changed until you reopen the toolbox.

The reason for this problem is at [1] which updates the pref first and then reads it again to the oldValue field. Then at [2] the theme switching returns early as the old value was incorrectly set to the the new value in [1].

A fixed version of this method has already crept to few places around the tree [3], [4].

If bug 1111047 is fixed with the way suggested there, this problem will most likely go away.

Here's a patch that fixes this particular problem. Fixing bug 1111047 would fix this too but this is a lot easier for now.

Can you please add a second patch here (or open a follow up bug) to get rid of this duplication by reusing setTheme?

Here's one. Tested locally on an older build so hopefully nothing related has changed in the last few days.

Try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=15ff0a9ee16e
Here's a better try run with everything rebased on top of latest fx-team: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=3e719c7b039f
Ugh, third time is the charm (the previous was missing my patches :( ): https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=ab088ed8c5a7

Nice
Don't think we need leave-open since both patches look ready to go once we have a green try push
The bustage in the try run seems to be resolved already in https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=70fa9da159a0.

The method 'setTheme' in shared/theme.js doesn't trigger a live theme change



Bug 1169993 - Fix setTheme in theme.js to really trigger a theme change in Developer Tools. r=bgrins 

Bug 1169993 - Remove duplicated setTheme methods from performance and webaudio tests. r=bgrins
