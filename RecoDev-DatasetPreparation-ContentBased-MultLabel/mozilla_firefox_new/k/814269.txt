The Social API <key>s are currently enabled by default (lacking disabled="true").

STR:
Have social.enabled=false and social.active=false
Open the Error Console and clear the current contents
Press Ctrl+Shift+L to share the current webpage

Expected:
No error in the error console.

Actual:

Error: Can't share page as no provider port is available
Source File: resource:///modules/Social.jsm
Line: 116

These keys should not execute if Social.enabled=false.

For example, the share key should only work if the page can be shared and a focus-chatbar key should only work if there are chats open.

disable the Social:SharePage command

The patch in bug 808422 disables the Social:FocusChat command/key - the only other remaining one current seems to be Social:SharePage.  Note this patch should be applied on top of the one from 808422.
