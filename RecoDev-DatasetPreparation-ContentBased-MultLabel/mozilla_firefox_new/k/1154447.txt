I've only seen this bug on the Aurora-channel so far.
We should have made a branch patch for 39. This is bug 1138630 getting broken due to the Windows theme refactorings. It's missing an aero asset, I bet.

Sylvestre, needinfo'ing because this is trivial and I'd like to just land this. See bug 1138630 for context - pretty sure it still has a comment where I told ntim his first patch was bitrotted by dao's theme refactor, and then now this uplift was being bitrotten by it.
Specifically, bug 1138630 comment 8.
