There are js compartment issues with Uint8Array, related to bug 734215.
We still have a problem, now getting "permission denied to access object".
This should have been fixed by bug 734215 - need to re-test.
My testing shows this as now working correctly - but I'm leaving this open as a reminder to remove the bufferToArrayHack from frameworker (or at least create a strategy to remove it - immediate removal might break amigo in the short term)
Is the relevant functionality not covered by the landed tests? testArrayUsingBuffer seems to cover it.

remove the hack

Yeah, testArrayUsingReader should cover it, so I guess a trivial s/todo// in browser_frameworker is also needed (I'm still getting a FF crash running that test from the addon, so I'm struggling to confirm it via the tests)
this hack function has not been in use for a few weeks, we can remove it.

Does this have or need an automated testcase?
No, this is just code removal.
