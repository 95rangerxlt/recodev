STR:

1. Open a window using: window.open("http://www.mozilla.org/", "_new", "height=500&width=500")
2. Try to read the page title from the top of the window


AR: no page title nor icon
ER: page title and icon, as on Nightly


AFAICT this is because in updateTitlebarDisplay, we're now only using gInPrintPreviewMode to determine whether to show the titlebar and change the chrome margins.

I believe this also causes some of our test failures, eg. the queryCaretRectWin failures in mochitest-other (chrome).

Patch

I believe the original removal of the window.menubar.visible bits was a mistake (as these are barprops and don't necessarily say anything about whether the actual XUL element is visible), so I've more or less changed that back (although calling it displayAppButton didn't make sense so I've called it drawInTitlebar instead). I *have* left out the check whether the menubar is autohidden, which I guess won't make sense anymore.

This fixes the issue I was seeing.

It also fixes the test I was originally looking at (test_queryCaretRect), as a side-effect.

Since this isn't about the app menu button anymore, it's unclear to me why this behavior should depend on window.menubar.visible.

I believe you should use window.toolbar.visible. That's what tabbrowser uses to hide the tab bar in popups.

OK. This works just as well in a quick test, so here we go...
