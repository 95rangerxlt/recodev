Hi Kevin,

We are making a big push to try and get as many extensions as possible working for the upcoming release of  Firefox 2 in a few weeks.  Do you know if this extension and the several others you have developed will be compatible and ready to work with Firefox 2?
I'm just getting time to go through and make this happen. Just got LinkChecker up to snuff and should get my others taken care of and tested this week. Thanks for the friendly reminder!
