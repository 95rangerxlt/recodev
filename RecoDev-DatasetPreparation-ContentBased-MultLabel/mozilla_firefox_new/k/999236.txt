Note, this means that clicking the link does nothing. Also happens for evaling 'document'.

I don't have time to look at it fully, but it seems to have something to do with it being a JSObject and not a ObjectWithURL in console.js.

webconsole-open-links-without-callback-in-new-tab.patch

Here's a patch that ensures all JSObjects that render anchors with URLs use the default handler if nothing else is specified. 

Ran the webconsole tests locally and this patch didn't cause any new failures.
patch works as advertised.

I'd like to get a try run for this. Do you have Try access, Sami?

No, I don't have access to the Try servers.
Flagging Rob to do a try push.
Got my access, here's a try run: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=8889a7500f25
Try run succeeded mostly: one unrelated test failure (bug 1028609) and a weird build error fixed by retry.
Thanks for the patch!
