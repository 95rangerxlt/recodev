STAGE_DIST is defined in both l10n.mk and browser/locales/Makefile.in twice.

We should remove the browser/locales/Makefile.in define to be sure these never get out of sync. They are currently in sync (except for style of the if)

Stop redefining STAGE_DIST in browser/locales/Makefile.in, l10n.mk is enough
