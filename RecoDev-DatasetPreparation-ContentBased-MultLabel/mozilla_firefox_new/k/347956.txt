I should have mentioned this bug is filed by proxy (me) and I'm on windows. The repo steps in comment 0 are what I suspect will lead to this problem being reproduced, but I can't actually say myself.

And confirmation would be appreciated.

I confirm the problem with Linux i686 build ID:2006080804.
This regressed between 2006-05-30-04 and 2006-05-31-04. 

Checkins: http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=PhoenixTinderbox&branch=MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2006-05-30+03&maxdate=2006-05-31+05&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot

Looks like fallout from bug 295683.

Untested patch. I will test once my tree finishes building.

Unforutunately, I can't trick my own build into thinking that I don't have Opear or SeaMonkey installed, so I guess this'll just have to go untested.

Gavin, is this too much of a hack?

patch

Seems to me like this would be better fixed by initializing fromfile to null outside of the first if block, then changing http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/migration/content/migration.js&rev=1.29#107 to:
|var selectedMigrator = fromfile;|
with comments as appropriate.

"Reference to the "From File" radio button" would be a better comment, I think.

"If the "fromfile" migrator is available, use it as the default in case we have no other migrators"

This is a very small patch that makes sure that a user can still import bookmarks from a file if there are no other browser installed (with bookmarks).

This IS a regression since 1.5.
