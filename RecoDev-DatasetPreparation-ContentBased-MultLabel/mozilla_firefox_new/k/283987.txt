I'm not seeing a "close window button" in fullscreen mode (no titlebar)
Alt-F4 and ctrl+shift+W are the only ways I can close it and they both cause the
close dialog to show.

top right, the x

That's just to close 1 tab at the time

this might make it clearer
The close button (id="close-button") uses "window.close();".
If I change it to "goQuitApplication();" it shows the confirm close dialog
Actually "BrowserTryToCloseWindow()" is better

Pressing the close button in fullscreen shuts down Firefox without any dialog.

This does seem to fix this (using the same method File -> Close Window uses). 
Patch as described by Kieran Britton in comment #5 and comment #6, but in CVS
diff form so it can be reviewed.

(I don't think any of us have CVS privs; mconnor, if this gets r+, please check
in for us; thanks.  Assuming no sr for browser.)

This bug has not been resolved as of Firefox 1.0.4. Is there a timeline as to
when this will be implemented?

This was fixed after 1.0.4, it will be working as expected in Firefox 1.1
