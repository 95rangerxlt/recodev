Disable 3 tests

browser/devtools/framework tests almost all work, but 3 need to be disabled for non-trivial failures.  This bug proposes we disable those tests when run under e10s.  The patch touches only browser.ini and references the bugs which make the fix non-trivial.

With this patch applied (and a couple of others I've requested review on) I get a successful run of this directory with e10s enabled.

Requesting review from both past and billm, but I'll take the first r+ I get ;)
