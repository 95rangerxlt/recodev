pageReport.js/xul are no longer used, and can be removed. Popup blocking also
uses what uses pageReport vars to store data on the tabbrowser/browser, when
they could use something much more descriptive and less complex. This bug is
about cleaning up the naming and old pieces of code that are no longer used.

Patch v1

This is almost s/pageReport/popupReport/

Changes:
 * Removed pageReport.js/xul/dtd
 * Renamed pageReportFirstTime.xul/dtd to popupReportFirstTime (could pose problems for l10n)
 * Renamed all instances of pageReport to popupReport
 * Changed id of popup icon from page-report-button to popup-report-button
 * Fixed (a part of) bug 311866, setting the privacy.popups.firstTime pref to false after the first time the dialog is shown.

I wouldn't consider this as the final patch (it breaks the suite). I'm curious whether to keep the naming and whether to add backwards compatibility with pageReport in browser/tabbrowser.

Comments? (Sorry, I'm a first time contributor)
Thanks for looking into this, Mike, patch looks good at first glance.

We should definitely remove the dead code, but I'm not sure whether the variable rename changes are worth the hassle at this point. It might be best to split the dead code removal and renaming so that they can be evaluated/reviewed separately - what do you think?

Patch v2

Makes sense to me, considering other mozilla code uses pageReport (in suite).

The patch just removes pageReport.xul/js/dtd from the build. 
Does this need sr, or is r enough?

toolkit/ and browser/ don't require SR (see http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/review.html and http://www.mozilla.org/projects/toolkit/review.html ), so this is good to go.
