Please make the Panorama deprecation warning more prominent.

Philipp suggested a black-on-yellow bar in attachment 8683061.
Instead, it is white on black, with a fade-in animation, at the bottom. That is too easy to overlook.

Users using other interfaces to Panorama like "Tab Groups Helper" do not get informed at all by the current mechanism.

Did you consider showing a permanent bar (for all tabs) above content if the user has tab groups and has not yet confirmed he knows about the deprecation?

That was already (also) implemented as part of bug 1221500. That is, that bug added both a one-off notification bar above all content (will go away after a restart or when you click the [x]), and one in tab groups.

Thanks for pointing this out!
Have not ever seen this and did not manage to do so starting from a fresh profile.
Will report this in bug 1221500.

You wouldn't see it on a fresh profile created after we added the warning. Only users upgrading with a profile that predates the warning will see it. You can set browser.migration.version to some value below 33 in about:config to see it again.

Please don't comment in bug 1221500 but file a new bug if you still don't see something when restarting Firefox on a profile that is using tab groups and with the pref mentioned earlier set low enough.

Should we move this to the top of the UI instead of at the bottom, as comment #0 points out?

::: browser/components/tabview/ui.js:1574
(Diff revision 1)
> +      .css({background: 'linear-gradient(#ffe13e, #ffc703) #ffc703', color: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.95)'})

Why set background-color when the background-image is opaque? You can remove the background-color from the background shorthand property.

Gah, I missed this part of your feedback somehow.

So, when I initially landed this it had a rough ride, because panorama's APIs depend on visual location of items, and so do its tests. The search field for panorama, for instance, is at the top, and the search output is at the bottom (and initially became invisible when I first landed the patch, causing test failures).

Because Philipp's mockup also has it at the bottom, and because of the tight dependencies of Panorama on its visual representation (if you look at what the HTML in that iframe looks like, with almost everything absolutely positioned, you will also see that changing something there without having it break or obscure anything else is... not easy...)....... I am inclined to leave it at the bottom. I think the color will be sufficient to draw attention to it. Let me know if you feel strongly about moving it to the top.
Understood, now doesn't seem like a good time to start improving how Panorama handles its layout ;)

Making the warning more visible seems like a good idea. Aurora44+
