We should use the new l10n.js lib from Gaia (bug 914414) in App Manager's template apps.

However, we're planning on landing the support for Mutation Observers and make use of the <template> element really soon.  This will require the use of polyfills in apps targeting older browsers.

Who is the target of the template app and would this be a problem?

Use the new l10n.js lib

Slight changes to data/locales.ini are needed.  We should also use navigator.mozL10n.once to guarantee that the l10n resources will be ready before we run the search.  I suggest to move the script tag linking l10n.js to head.

Stas, many thanks for the diff demonstrating how to integrate the new lib. Only issue is you used the master branch instead of the review-1 branch which is the one where I'm working on, but I take your points e.g. regarding moving the script to head, which I already did it :D

Regarding the audience: we want people to build things using best practices. It's good to educate them in new standard features, so we might be able to include a polyfill if needed as long as we clearly explain what it does and why we're including it.

I only have a couple of questions:

- what are the estimates for landing these new features (Mutation Observers, <template> elements)
- where exactly are you landing these? Gaia/Firefox OS, Firefox Desktop, Firefox Android...?

I will apply the changes Stas suggested and use this intermediate new version of l10n.js, and we can update it later when you finally switch to l20n, but I have a request here: please give a new home to this library so I can refer to that instead of to some file nested in the gaia codebase.

Otherwise it's super hard to keep track of when changes happen or even to point people to use a good, well tested library, as it has happened to me already-I used the old version because I couldn't find the new one, and because articles such as this: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/01/localizing-the-firefox-os-boilerplate-app/ say any version is fine

Also, having its own home gives it its own README and its own documentation which are super important.

Shall I file a bug for this?
I think the question comes down to "what is the cross-browser webby story for our l10n efforts regarding apps?"

That's great to hear!  It aligns well with our plans for the near future of the l10n library.  We want to use modern technologies to disrupt the way l10n is currently done.

Mutation Observers: bug 992473, with a patch ready for review
<template>: bug 994357, with a patch waiting for feedback, probably needs to be rebased.

Gaia/Firefox OS.  The plan is to land them early in the 2.1 cycle, which means next couple of weeks.

I've started documenting the API here:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator.mozL10n

I'll also work on the README in the https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/tree/gaia/ repo.
Fixed in the latest versions of these templates, I've also got a bug for Mortar so we remember to update to L20n when that finally happens: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1025018
