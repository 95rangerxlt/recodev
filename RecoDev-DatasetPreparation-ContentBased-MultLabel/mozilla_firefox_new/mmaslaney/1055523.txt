Below are mocks of the OSX 10.10 Yoesimite theme utilizing our previous 10.9 assets. As you can see, the transparent assets for our previous OSX versions integrate quite nicely with the new theme. Therefore, my recommendation is to continue using tabstrip assets from the previous theme.

Examples

I was more worried about buttons, when moved to the tab bar. They look like this: http://imgur.com/QPMX662

The transparent grey might not work well on the tab bar?
I would stick with the pre-existing assets.
