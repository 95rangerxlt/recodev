Current in-content dialog appearance.png

Does this bug is enough to cover improvements to the current appearance (see attachment) or should I file a bug about the text too close to the left edge ?
With landing of bug 1035540 it should look better.
Project Chameleon specs needed :)

Current Dialog style

Current style with bug 1038288 checked in.

The Security/Password Exceptions needs some styling as the padding isn't correct. And with bug 1035625 the Content/Colors dialog is now to tall again.

Ah okay -> unassigned.

Dialog font sizes are off on OS X

Note also this, on OS X (apparently OK on Windows, according to IRC). Would be good to settle on font sizes.
