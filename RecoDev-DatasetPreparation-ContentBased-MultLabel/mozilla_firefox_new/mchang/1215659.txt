I am using Nightly 44 with e10s on a Retina MacBook Pro. I have seen similar content scaling bugs when dragging e10s browser windows between my MacBook Pro's builtin Retina display and an external non-HiDPI display, e.g. bug 1125325 and bug 978913.

See the attached screenshot.

Might be a regression from bug 1197361.
Yup, probably a regression from 1197361.

Use destination canvas as thumbnail size

There was a problem, where sometimes we would be provided with a destination canvas already, but we'd go down a path to try to take the snapshot at a size smaller than the destination canvas. In those cases, just try to snapshot at the destination canvas size.

Also, sometimes, we'd get a black canvas because nsIProgressWatcher would actually give us an error, but we'd continue to snapshot the page. The web content wasn't actually ready, so we'd snapshot nothing.

Use destination canvas as thumbnail size

Given that this was manually tested, has automated mochitest coverage and has been in Nightly for a few days, let's uplift to Aurora44.
