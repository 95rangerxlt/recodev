Decision bug stemming from Bug 1028966.

Designs can be viewed here: http://people.mozilla.org/~sfranks/Promotion/In-Product%20Promotion%20for%20Default%20Browser%20Status.pdf

Personal recommendations on what to pursue:

- Notification Bar
- Home Page snippets
- Prompt in Customization Mode
- More Prominent Preferences Placement
- At end of Firefox Accounts signup

All, of course, with telemetric probes so we can determine effectiveness.

These evaluations don't seem to predict the effectiveness and impact of each design. I think this should be part of the consideration just like the annoyance level. For instance, I would not expect there to be a significant overlap between those end users customizing Firefox or setting up a Firefox Account and those who don't have Firefox as their default browser. If there was such an overlap, this would already be a state of failure. We should focus our efforts on having an effective prompt at some central place that users cannot miss.
Decision made to go forward with Notification Bar (Bug 1033482, Bug 1040851), Browser Preferences (Bug 1040868), and end of first-run tour (Bug 1040878).
Hi Sevaan, can you provide a point value.
MarcoM: Easy, 1


Decision: Determine which designs for Default Browser promotion we should move forward with.
