Changing the default search engine is probably not something most users do very often, so I think the buttons "Switch to [new]" and "Keep searching with [current]" should be in reverse order, with the "Keep searching with [current]" as the default option. After all, why would someone install an add-on to change something that can be changed in the UI? I guess it's safe to assume that this prompt is only going to notify users that some program is trying to invade their browser with a Conduit/Ask-like malware.
Mostly this will be used by add-ons that install additional search plugins (i.e. for engines we don't ship by default).  I don't think we can safely assume either case is dominant, so we should design a clear UI that gives the user control.

Notification bar prompting users to choose default search engine

- Persistent across all tabs & windows
- Choice must be made in order to dismiss the bar
- If user closes the browser without making a choice, bar appears next time browser is open
- If external application makes a change while Firefox is closed, the bar appears next time Firefox is open
I think the Make ask.com my default shouldn't have a primary button, since users are unlikely gonna like having their search engine change using some random crapware. So I would either make the "Keep using Yahoo" primary, or put both at the same level of importance (aka gray).
I think it's important to not treat this change in isolation.  We're looking at a bunch of other measures to combat bad actors seeking to bypass user choice, and this is an API for responsible add-ons to use to confirm an action, rather than directly changing things as they do now.  I don't think it strikes a good balance to assume bad faith for add-ons actually using a consent API instead of bypassing it.

I was under the impression that going through this UI would be the only way for add-ons/thrid parties to change the default search provider (much like Windows 8 makes you go through a standard UI to change the default browser). From your comment, it sounds like it is optional though.

So would this actually help us prevent bad actors from just flipping the search engine, or is it just an extra step for add-ons willing to opt into this flow?
It won't be optional.  The current plan is to make this mandatory for all add-ons to use, and if they don't use it they'll get blocklisted.
