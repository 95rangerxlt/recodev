We want to set up arewefastyet graphs for the v8 tests. Those should constantly update the tested Shumway version, taken from http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/shell/shumway-shell.zip

To make the used version visible in the AWFY web interface, we need to include it in the shell bundle. Perhaps a top-level file called "revision" that just contains the hash?
