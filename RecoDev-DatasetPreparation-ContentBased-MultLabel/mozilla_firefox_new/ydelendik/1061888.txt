Update Shumway to version 0.9.2680

Review of attachment 8483114:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One thing we can do to reduce the size of the patch quite substantially (I hope at least) is to let tsc remove comments during compilation. I kinda like having them for debugging purposes, so ideally we'd only do that when compiling for bundling purposes, but if that's harder to do, then let's just remove them entirely. tsc has a setting for that.

Other than that, looks good, so r=me with the enableVerifier thing explained or fixed.

We should just go through and remove these mode lines everywhere. Not important for the purposes of this patch, though.

Nit: "recommended"

Hmm, why is this commented out? The commit in which you did that doesn't give any reason. Does it mean that we don't enable the verifier at all, or just that it's not possible to deactivate it in about:config?

Let's change these two to console.info.
