set MOZ_APP_NAME

It would be nice to be able to set MOZ_APP_NAME in the mozconfig to avoid filesystem collisions.  My specific use case is packaging Firefox in an RPM.

I have been running a copy of firefox for a long time on my linux machines with this patch and --with-app-name=minefield for a couple weeks with no adverse effects.

Not really sold on the benefits, but I'm not morally opposed to it either.

Oh, I forgot one thing.

I believe we more often write this as "if test -n "$WITH_APP_NAME";".
