In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the same directory (perhaps with "_perwindowpb" appended to its file name), and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.  Note that the original test should only be added to the list of test files in Makefile.in ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING, and the new test file should be added to the list with the reverse condition.

It will be used later on.

Patch v1

The test is ready, however the last tests are failing, but they should not. 
To explain further, I have found a bug, because when the observer to purge history is notified, the content pref for 'browser.update.lastDir' is not being clear on PB window. 

Using the observer to purge history:
> Services.obs.notifyObservers(null, "browser:purge-session-history", "");

The 'browser.download.lastDir' content pref is being clear fine for both PB and not PB. 
See: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/DownloadLastDir.jsm#55

But, the 'browser.update.lastDir' content pref is not being clear for both and it should. 
See: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/html/content/src/nsHTMLInputElement.cpp#538

With that fixed, the test should pass fine. 

Should I file a new bug for this? Or fix it in the same patch?

I'll be away starting tomorrow.  Josh can review this.
Eep. That's a good problem to notice, and not simple to fix :(
Ehsan, how do you feel about not clearing the browser.update.lastDir content pref for private windows when purging session history? My thinking is that I don't have a good way to solve the issue right now without further API changes, and it will get cleared with the closing of the private session.

That's fine by me.
Andres, the best course of action here is to fix the test to not check that the browser.download.lastDir content pref is cleared for the private window after the browser:purge-session-history notification is sent.
