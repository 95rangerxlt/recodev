There's a lot of trailing whitespace and it bothers me. Instead of maybe fixing it piecemeal if a test or surrounding code gets touched, I'd rather just do it all in one go and be more vigilant for new code.

Assuming these patches are ok, I can do the same to the other files in browser/components/sessionstore as well.

Should all the tests have trailing spaces removed too?
I've actually had these and others in my patch queue since I filed this. But the problem I've had is that there's no great time to land this - it's going to be super annoying to people working on larger sessionstore bugs right now (I know bug 516755 which is a big project and bug 587873 which is less bad). This is also going to bitrot fast. I think we should hold off until we have a nice quiet sessionstore period.

I should have made it clear here that this is stalled for the time being, so I apologize that you spent the time doing these. Hopefully you didn't spend too long!

I can see you're itching for some more bugs to work on, so I'll try to find one that's more ready.
Ah that's ok - it didn't take very long to do those
