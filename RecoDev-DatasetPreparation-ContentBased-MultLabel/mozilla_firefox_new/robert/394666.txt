The prefpanes display incorrect heights when the animateFadeIn pref is true (Linux as well).

Even though this is not the default configuration I'm going to take a stab at fixing this and at the very least make it better.

Hey mconnor, this fixes prefWindow animation for Windows / Linux and includes a better fix for bug 349098 in that it doesn't require that the Tabs' prefpane to have flex and  makes _content extend to the available height when animation is turned off. I had to use sizeToContent after the first prefpane is loaded in order to get style information but it is only called once so this should be safe. The one thing it doesn't fix is when animation is turn on and the tabs prefpane has wrapping text which has been broken for a long time. I'll look into fixing that as well in a separate bug.

I'm fine with landing this for M8 (perhaps it isn't too late since there have been several checkins after freeze) or M9.
