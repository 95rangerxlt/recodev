This limits the cases to only when files can't be renamed.

I would like to get this landed for at least Firefox 35.

It's too late to take this change in Firefox 34 and ESR 31.3. We can consider this change for Firefox 35 and ESR 31.4.

Taking this for Aurora (35). It doesn't meet ESR criteria and it's not clear there's much value here vs. waiting for 38.0ESR so unless there's a strong case for this from ESR deployers, let's wait.
