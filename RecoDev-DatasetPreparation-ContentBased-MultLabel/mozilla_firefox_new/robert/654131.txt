bug 597235 was supposed to deal with this....

I'm visiting a work computer, it has the following in
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\extensions:
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0017-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0020-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0023-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0024-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
(as well as .net framework and skype extensions...)

these are apparently u17, u20, u23, and u24. only u24 should be present - it isn't current, but it's the latest one installed on this system.

I was asked to file this bug by someone in mozilla.public.dev-planning. I will not have access to this computer in the future.

If there's a mozilla installer/updater log file that should be collected, please indicate it ASAP or else it is unlikely that anyone will be able to retrieve it. I believe this was an update via the menu from firefox3.6.x.

Thanks timeless, could you check if there is an uninstall.log file in the uninstall directory?

listing of files in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\extensions
To check the post update cleanup of the files run cmd.exe as admin, cd into <firefox install dir>\uninstall\, and run helper.exe /PostUpdate.
I did that, nothing happened / no files were deleted....
Thanks, it appears that dir paths can no longer end with a \... pretty sure it worked back when we used NSIS 2.22. Before I submit a patch I'm going to audit usage.
Bug 659772 also says the console can also exist with ID {CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0026-ABCDEFFEDCBA}.
I can confirm that there are more than 76 million installations of Java Console in Firefox 4 and later. This bug is fairly important, as these add-ons are likely not compatible and users may be reluctant to upgrade thinking they are losing functionality.

If you need an updated list of GUIDs, let me know.

These are all of the active Java Console GUIDs.

Jim, turns out that the check if a dir exists will fail if the path ends in a slash. :( Reminds me of how stat will return ENOENT when checking a dir path that ends with a slash. This also adds a couple of new java console extensions to the list that have a large number of users.

I hate these things, they are so annoying!
