This is a much better source for the files and directories and I recently noticed that new files aren't always being added to the uninstall.log possibly due to the numerous changes to app update especially with the addition of staging.

Thunderbird patch

I'm removing the deletion of the distribution directory from the common code so removal can be optional. Since Thunderbird supports the distribution directory this change is necessary.

patch rev1

removed-files is now listed in the precomplete file so it doesn't have to be handled separately.

It's too late for Firefox 34 and ESR 31.3. We can consider this change for Firefox 35 and ESR 31.4.

Taking this for Aurora (35). It doesn't meet ESR criteria and it's not clear there's much value here vs. waiting for 38.0ESR so unless there's a strong case for this from ESR deployers, let's wait.
