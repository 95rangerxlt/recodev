The Site with the URL from the shortcut + profile Manager

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/2007020823 Firefox/2.0.0.2

When you start Firefox with a Web shortcut (as example a Bookmark-link on your desktop) and you have several profiles (and you use the profile manager) to start Firefox (don`t ask at startup is unchecked), you will see the following things:

1. Firefox will display the URL from the Shortcut and on a second window you see the profile manager (see screenshot).

2. When you start Firefox with the Profile Manager, Firefox crash and the Windows Error Message occur (Error in Firefox.exe occurred and will be now closed...), Talkback does not launch !

Reproduced on Windows 2000 SP4 and XP x64

When you don`t use the profile manager and start Firefox from a Shortcut, no crash happen, but you see Bug 370073.

STR:

1. Make sure you have 2 (or more) Firefox Profiles on your system. Uncheck "don`t ask at startup", so that Firefox will ask each time which profile do you want to use.
2. Create a Web Shortcut on your desktop and close Firefox
3. Launch Firefox with the Webshortcut, you will see the url from your web shortcut and the profile manager in the background
4. Select a profile on the profile manager -> start -> crash

err, sorry wrong bug number, i mean Bug 370053
Seems the same as bug 295248 which pre-existed this change though it may exhibit the crash in different circumstances now.

r=sspitzer, I think we should consider wrapping the _haveProfile: false, with #ifdef XP_WIN, but that is your call.

I'm fine either way.
