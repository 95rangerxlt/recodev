If you click on a URL shortcut icon eg Google, Firefox will open two instances. The first instance is the webpage of the URL, the second window which now has focus on top of the first window is whatever you have Firefox set to open to at startup (in my case homepage).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a URL shortcut icon.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Two instances of Firefox open. The first instance is the URL destination webpage form the shortcut, eg www.google.com. Another instance of Firefox opens(set to whatever is in Options>Main>Startup eg my home page) on top of first window and steals focus from first window. 

Expected Results:  
Only one instance of Firefox set to the URL specified in the shortcut icon should open.

This bug can be produced in Vista and XP. When I did a format of Vista, there was an error message stating "Windows cannot find http://www.google.com/. Make sure you typed the name correctly and start again." AND an instance of Firefox also opened at whatever it was set to start at (I set it to my homepage).
I did not see this bug in the Feb 2 nightly build but see it in the Feb 10 build.

I can't reproduce this. Started from the command line with C:\........\...\........\branch\firefox\firefox.exe "www.google.com" and I see only Google. I also tried editing the shortcut in the Properties\Target field with the same result. 
Could you give additional steps?
OK, I see now what you mean:

- Drag a bookmark to your desktop
- Close the browser and double-click on the shortcut.
Hm, I see similar (but not quite the same) behaviour in July 2004 builds and maybe earlier.

patch - needs testing
I can confirm this, this happens when you don`t use the profile manager. 

When you use the profile manager, the url from the shortcut is displayed on Firefox start, but you will crash when you use the profile manager. Filed Bug 370123 about this.

approved for 1.8 branch, a=dveditz
Checked in to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH
To verify launch an url shortcut with the browser closed . See comment #2 for info on how to create an url shortcut.
verified fixed for 1.8.1.2 using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/20070215 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre Mnenhy/0.7.5.0 ID:2007021503 and using the steps to reproduce from comment #0  -> only one instance of Firefox is opened when i use a shortcut icon
verified fixed on the 1.8 branch using Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/2007021503 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre. Clicking a URL shortcut from the desktop with Firefox closed launches one instance of the page, not two.
This bug still repro's on the 1.8.0 branch for vista.  

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.11) Gecko/20070312 Firefox/1.5.0.11

I still see two instances of the URL spawning Firefox browsers through Desktop launch and Start>Run launch.

Are there any plans to fix this in the 1.8.0 branch?
