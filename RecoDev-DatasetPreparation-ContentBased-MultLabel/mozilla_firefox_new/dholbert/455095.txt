The "mozilla-central leak test build" machine has been reporting 0 leaks and 0 allocations ("A: 0") since 09/08 04:31.

The last build with nonzero values, starting at 09/08 04:31, had:
  rev:48ca5b355829
  RLk:0B
  Lk:1.28MB
  MH:25.0MB
  A:783507

And the build after that, starting at 09/08 04:38, had:
  rev:6772511dc81a
  RLk:0B
  Lk:0B
  MH:0B
  A:0

and it's all 0's from there on out.

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6772511dc81a (bug 451918) is the only checkin in the blame range, so it presumably changed something that broke leak stats.

I just backed that out, to see if it fixes this.
The backout is http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/9d9569916616
Yup, that backout seems to have fixed it.

The first build after the backout has:
RLk:0B
Lk:1.28MB
MH:25.3MB
A:780342
Only "Linux mozilla-central leak test build" showed this.

"OS X 10.5.2 mozilla-central leak test build"
and
"WINNT 5.2 mozilla-central leak test build"
still reported fine.

Fwiw,

See bug 451871 too ... in which an issue was reported to brake Linux ... but
which I couldn't reproduce on my local Windows.

Per bug 451918 comment 4 hint,
there may be something wrong with trace-malloc, but on Linux only ?!
If you cc: me on a bug, it's helpful to know why.

Backed out changeset 6772511dc81a (bug 451918) to see if it fixes broken linux leak stats (bug 455095)
