Noticed this go by in my terminal, when entering responsive design mode in Devtools, in a debug build:
{
JavaScript strict warning: resource:///modules/devtools/ViewHelpers.jsm, line 803: SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
}

As in bug 1126655, the assignment seems intentional here, so we just need an extra layer of parens to silence the warning.
