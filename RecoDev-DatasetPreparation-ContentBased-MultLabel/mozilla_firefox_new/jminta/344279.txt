As of now, the LOG function directly dumps stuff to the console. We need to do something like Gavin did in nsSearchService. See also bug 343080 (microsummaries equivalent of this).

Ben, can you take care of this?

check feeds.log pref

Patch makes the LOG function check whether feeds.log is set to true.  If the pref is unset (as in a normal profile), or set to false, then we don't dump anything.  Those wishing to debug can set the pref to true.

Style for this file dictates:

var prefB = 
    Cc["contract-id"].
    getService(Ci...);

>+  var shouldLog = false;
>+  try {
>+    shouldLog = prefB.getBoolPref("feeds.log");

and

try { 
 //..
}
catch (e) {
}

I *highly* doubt it.  If someone has reason to believe this checkin caused this regression, I'd like to hear it, but please don't blindly speculate.  This checkin didn't touch anything in the actual FeedWriter object.

check feeds.log pref

Requesting 1.8.1 approval.  This is a minimal change, using code that has been tested in a variety of components.  It fixes a significant bug in a new feature.  Testcase is to view any feedpage, for instance the one linked from planet.mozilla.org.
