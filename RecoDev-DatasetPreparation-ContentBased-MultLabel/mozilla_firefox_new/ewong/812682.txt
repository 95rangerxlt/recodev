Sorry, not sure how to upload batch files...

eBay 32x32 png file
This is an easy one to pick-up: just a matter of pushing the 16x16 PNG through http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/cgi/data/data with the "base64" option selected, and then replacing the data: URI in the <Image> in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/searchplugins/eBay.xml with the result.

As far as I can tell, we don't have an eBay search for mobile, and bug 795495 isn't fixed yet, so we don't yet have use for the 32x32 version. The 16x16 ICO is a larger file for some reason (does it include both sizes?), so we probably don't need to use that.

Thanks, but I forgot to mention one thing - if you copy out of the Firefox URL bar, you'll get the escaped version, so you need to unescape that. Let's use this:

Joanne points out via email that it would be good to uplift this change to Aurora/Beta to avoid having to wait until Firefox 20. This is a trivial image swap, no risk and no string changes/etc.

Thanks Ryan!

Good catch, I had forgotten about those. We'll have to fix that in a followup, I filed bug 818328.
Guess you want this for comm-% and thunderbird, too?
"Want" is a strong word, I don't think there's a strong driver for comm-% and thunderbird to do anything (of course they're free to...).
Verified fixed on the latest beta, Firefox 18 beta 3.
