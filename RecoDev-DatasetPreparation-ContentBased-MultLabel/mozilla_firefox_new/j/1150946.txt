Bug 1003991 added a new toolbox option:

"Enable Service Workers testing features"

From the bug, it allows you to use them over http instead of requiring https, but that is not all clear from the name.

At the very least, we should document the meaning, but should we re-label the option too?

José, are the plans to put other Service Worker developer features behind the same flag, or will it remain as just allowing them over HTTP?

No, there aren't AFAIK. We should re-label the option. Do you want me to do it? I could add some doc if you want to make things clearer. Sorry. Thanks!

It would be great to re-label it something like "Enable Service Workers over HTTP (when toolbox is open)".  Also, updating the options docs[1] would be great, but we can also set "dev-doc-needed" here to have them updated by MDN Docs team.

If you're able to make the label change, that would be great!

This patch changes the label to "Enable Service Workers over HTTP (when toolbox is open)". Once it lands I'll add some doc in MDN.

Nikhil, are you also ok with this change?

Text changes look great to me, but you'll need to change the string IDs so the l10n team can pick it up[1], and then update the files where they are referenced.

Maybe replace "enableServiceWorkersTesting" with "enableServiceWorkersHTTP"?  Up to you, as long they change! :)
