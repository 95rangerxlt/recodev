We know that Firefox users - as many as 18% - have enabled Do Not Track (DNT) in Firefox.  Our goal in New Tab's Directory Tiles (DT) is that:

a. DNT users feel their choice and privacy is being respected at all times with DT
b. DNT users feel in control of their data with DT
c. DNT users' wishes are respected with regards to DT
d. DNT users aren't negatively surprised by DT

It's arguable that what DT does by directing users to sites with a referral link doesn't fall under DNT, but not all users will feel this way.  Indeed, the exact expectation of behavior blocked by DNT will likely vary by user, making it important to know DNT users' expectations and sentiment around Tiles and making sure we're being consistent in our policy and messaging.

We're proposing creating an A-B study in which we try a few variations of DT behavior for DNT users on beta with telemetry enabled.  The goal will be to obtain data both in user response to the alternatives, and also user sentiment on the alternatives.

The possible alternatives are:

1. Turning DT off for all DNT users
2. Leaving DT on for all DNT users and saying nothing (not an option we'd consider)
3. Defaulting DT on for DNT users, but asking if they'd like to turn it off
4. Defaulting DT off for DNT users, but asking if they'd like to turn it on

The kinds of data at stake in DT are:

i. Impression data: The number of times users simply see DT.  This data is sent once a day, so potentially if a user sees DT and then opts out, nothing would be sent.
ii. Click-through data via code.  For now not tile-specific, will be in the future.

As a first step, I'll be sketching a few alternatives for #3 and #4 above, and after gaining feedback, we'll be developing a few to A-B & user sentiment test.

> 1. Turning DT off for all DNT users

We've gone with option 1 here.  This could be considered a hardline approach but it greatly simplifies the feature.  We assume that DNT users would not want to (by default) participate in the Tiles metrics reporting of aggregate clicks and impressions.  However to receive Directory Tiles from the Tiles Service we require the browser locale and use the IP address to deliver the proper set of Tiles.  That information sent by the browser or received during the transaction is recorded in accordance with our data policies and we felt DNT users might be surprised by this.  In the future we may be able to honor the DNT header and deliver Tiles without recording the transaction but until then we have defaulted to off.
