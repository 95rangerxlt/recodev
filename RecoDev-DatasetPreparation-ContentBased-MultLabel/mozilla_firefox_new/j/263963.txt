There's almost zero chance of bug 254992 being fixed for 1.0, so we need to
tweak what we can, where we can to make this as low-key as possible.

Adding " (Linux only", " (Mac only)", and " (Windows only)" may be the best fix,
although it's not scalable for " (Windows/Mac only)" or " (Windows/Linux only)"
due to length.  This also introduces the problem of what to do for users who
can't parse this information.  ("Windows/Linux?  What's that?  I use Windows,
but this Linux thing is new to me.")

Options -> Options (Preferences)
(Windows or Linux)

These are the basic changes made.  I removed "Options" from the end of the
strings for the names of the sections of the ToC that were subsections of
"Options (Preferences)" because they were redundant.  Finally, I removed two
obsolete items from the Help menu items list.  (One had been commented out, but
the other one was still in view and couldn't possibly work.)

In the index I mostly fixed the Options/Preferences thing by removing Options
wherever possible.  Options itself became Options (Preferences).  I didn't
specify anything by platform to keep the texts shorter, because I think the
index can't support long text as well as the ToC can.

Steffen, what do you think of this?  We have until midnight tomorrow, so let's
try to make this relatively quick.  It's branch-only, because by the next
iteration of Firefox we should have platform-specific RDF capabilities.

Sure.
Fixed, aviary branch *only*.  (I remembered this time! ;-) )
