There are some changes I recently made on the trunk that need to be replicated in 
firebird and thunderbird. They are bug 158006, bug 195093,  bug 204039, bug 206146 
and bug 152264(not yet landed in the trunk).   
 
I'm gonna upload a patch (except for 152264) so that it can be committed to firebird.

a patch

I replicated changes made by committed patches for bug 158006, bug 204039, bug
206146. 

For other two bugs, I'll upload firebird/thunderbird patch and ask for help
when landing mozilla-trunk patches.

landed.

jshin: thanks!
should this be marked Fixed ?
sorry that I forgot to get back here. yes, the patch was checked in as noted in 
comment #2. However, the last time I checked, there's something strange (it 
behaves differently from the way it's supposed to with this check-in) in 
firebird. Let me leave this open until I check it out to be sure.

I thought the fix for bug 199227 was a part of this, but it's not. I deal with
it elsewhere. Everything dealt with here was fixed.



a few pref/xpfe changes need to be ported to firebird
