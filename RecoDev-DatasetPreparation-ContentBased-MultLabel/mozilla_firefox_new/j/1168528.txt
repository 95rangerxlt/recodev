toolkit/themes/windows/global/icons/close-win8.png was unused.

Stephen said over IRC[1] that we should use the Windows8 close icons for all versions of Windows, so I've overwritten close.png with close-win8.png and used close-win8@2x.png from the icons attachment in bug 1147702 for close@2x.png.

Even better would be to switch to SVG like Linux usesâ€¦

You should keep this, as Linux is already using SVG...

I would have expected this rule to need to include the other two selectors, too. Am I wrong? If so, please add a comment to the code as to why.

Patch, part 1 v1.1

Added the %ifdef guards around the .close-icon section in global.css. Note that I removed the %ifdef in the previous version because it was only guarding the media queries for lunaBlue, etc.

Patch, part 2 (new tab and tab arrows)

Added the extra selectors to the rule. Previously, there was a couple pixel difference between the new tab button as a tab, the docked new tab button, and the new tab button in customization mode. With this change, they are now all the same size.

Should we do this everywhere, not just for hidpi, for consistency and so we can spot issues more quickly? This might also affect add-ons.

Huh. Rereading code and doublechecking jar.mn, AFAICT the linux one overrides the Windows one anyway, so we can indeed do without the %ifdef. Sorry about leading you astray there.

I also suspect (but would like shorlander/mmaslaney/some-graphics-y-person to doublecheck) that we could use the linux SVGs on Windows (potentially with minor tweaking). Can you file a followup for that?
