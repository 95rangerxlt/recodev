This bug is for the MsgRouteError crash; bug 1203602 will be reduced in scope to the remaining data loss bugs, because it already has comments which go into detail about them.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1203602 +++

Part of the cause of bug 1202887 is that closing a tab while a persistence operation is in progress will immediately destroy the PBrowser actor and all its descendents, including any PWebBrowserPersistDocument actors, thus leaving a partially completed save.

This is almost certainly not what the user expects, and also doesn't match the non-e10s behavior where holding a reference to the document is enough to keep it alive.

But it's worse than that: a parent->child message can be sent on the PWebBrowserPersistDocument concurrently with the child->parent PBrowser::__delete__, which results in one of these:

###!!! [Child][DispatchAsyncMessage] Error: (msgtype=0xE60003,name=???) Route error: message sent to unknown actor ID

Which crashes the content process.  (For reference, 0xE60003 is PWebBrowserPersistDocument::SetPersistFlags.)  There are probably already some of these on crash-stats, but I don't know if there's enough info in the dump to distinguish them from other child-side MsgRouteError crashes.

So this needs a way of keeping the TabChild alive until persistence is finished.

I have work in progress that reparents the actors to PContent, and I've found an excitingly new failure mode: WebBrowserPersistLocalDocument::ReadResources can report an error through its return value *and* through the EndVisit callback, which turns into a double-Send__delete__ when it's remote.  This is simple enough to fix (but I think the only reason I found it is because a frame with no loader now causes the outer DOM traversal to fail, which is arguably a regression itself; sigh).

Also, I observe that the content process will cheerfully shut down while the save is happening, which results in a bunch of "Channel closing: too late to send/recv," and a failed save, but that doesn't cause a crash so it doesn't need to be fixed in this bug.

There's one part of this that I'm not quite sure what to do with: Now that we're starting the protocol from a PContent, getting the top-level document of a particular PBrowser is kind of awkward.  I can pass the actor, which means another parameter that's not used for child->parent construction, and then the GetDocument method is protected so I have to get around that somehow (or change it).  This all seems less than ideal, but I don't know if there's an alternative that doesn't have other problems.
I can't think of any other way than interrogating the PBrowser for its document, I'm afraid. :/

Out of curiosity, will this account for the case where a save operation has begun, but the last tab for a particular content process has closed (which should cause the content process to shut down) - or are we somehow keeping the content process alive until the save is completed?

Which means I need to know if there's a reason to keep TabChild::GetDocument protected.

No, in that case IPC messages get dropped and the save fails; see comment #1.  That can be handled in bug 1203602; for this bug I'm just trying not to crash.

It looks like there's no reason for TabChildBase::GetDocument to be protected â€”Â it's just a convenience for calling WebNavigation(), which is public, and QI'ing it.

Most of these comments are optional. I would like to make sure the test fails on try though.

See BrowserTestUtils.openNewForegroundTab for a nicer way to do this.

I'm really surprised this doesn't trigger our flaky timeout validation.

Can you make sure this test fails reasonably often on try without your fixes? It seems possible that the delays you've chosen won't be valid for our test machines.

You could use loadFrameScript with a data: URL here. Might be easier.

It might be easier to do this as a loop, with each iteration calling add_task. I think you should be able to do that even with arguments.

I tested that (with the various combinations of the two fixes-or-not), but I didn't retry to get info on how reliably it would fail.

According to the code, // Right now, we only enable these checks for mochitest-plain.

I wonder if multiple setTimeout(_, 0)s would do the same thing.  I don't know if that's less sketchy or more.

This is why I threw in a bunch of longer timeouts, and tested that it would catch both bugs on tryâ€¦ but this might call for some retrying.

I had that in one of this test's many other versions, but I already had a frame script to get the 'load' eventâ€¦ but BrowserTestUtils already does that.  (It looks like I could have saved some time and frustration writing this if I'd known about BrowserTestUtils; such is hindsight.)

next_test with an 's' would be what I meant; oops.

I'd rather leave it as-is â€”Â making the control flow less explicit may not be a good idea given what this test is testing, and it's been argued that I've already spent too much time on this test case as it is.

Step 3: add a regression test. [v2]

I've used openNewForegroundTab and gotten rid of the frame script, but I'm leaving the rest of it as-is for now.  (Including the possibly flaky timeouts â€”Â which aren't as bad as most, because they can't cause the test to spuriously fail, only to spuriously pass in case of a hypothetical future regression.)  Carrying over r+ and currently waiting for try runs.
Failed 5/5 times on each platform, with the actor reparenting but missing the double-__delete__ patch (which is the one that needs the 10ms timeout): https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=2867f743b728 (except Windows, where the test jobs are still waiting in the queue after nearly 5 hours).
â€¦and *this* is a try run with all the patches, restricted to only embedding and jsdownloads tests, which looks a little weird because I was figuring out how to use |mach try| and got it wrong the first time: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=dbddab73b7d9 (the B2G orange is because none of these tests run there, so the test runner objects to having 0 tests to run; the try syntax can't easily avoid that, I don't think).
Great, thanks!
