After bug 912121, we'll need to use "mach build devtools/*" to build the full tree.  We have

/devtools/client
/devtools/server
/devtools/shared

but no products include just "/devtools" (in order to package client and server separately), so no Makefile is created for that dir.

We should make some kind of change so "mach build devtools" works.

Maybe the ./mach build command could somehow detect this and transform it into "devtools/*"
:glandium, any moz.build tricks I can use to make this happen?

It would be developer friendly if "mach build devtools" built all 3 subdirs, but there is no moz.build file the says "DIRS += ['/devtools'] (instead each subdirectory is included separately).
How about just using `mach build faster`?

> How about just using `mach build faster`?

Yes, that's probably good enough for most DevTools purposes. :)
As a side effect of the implementation of bug 1203159, `mach build devtools` will also work once that bug lands.
Fixed by bug 1203159.


"mach build devtools" should do the right thing
