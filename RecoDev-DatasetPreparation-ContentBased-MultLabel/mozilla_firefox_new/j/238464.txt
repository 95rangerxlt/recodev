If you right-click a broken image icon and select Set as Wallpaper, then click
Select in the subsequent dialog, Firefox will crash in
nsWindowsShellService::SetDesktopBackground on a null pointer. I have a patch
that seems to fix the problem. Maybe this action shouldn't even be enabled on
the context menu for non-existant images, but since the other options are (like
View Image), I'm just fixing the underlying crash.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to set your desktop wallpaper to a broken image icon.


Actual Results:  
Firefox will crash.

Expected Results:  
No crash, and no change in the wallpaper image either.

Could you please take a look at this when you get the chance, Ben?
WFM.  What am I supposed to click in the "Set Wallpaper" dialog after opening it?
After the "set wallpaper" dialog shows up, clicking the "set wallpaper" button
in that dialog causes the crash for me. If it would be helpful I can post a
stack trace.

rv happens to be NS_OK. Which means you return the wrong thing. I'm sorry no
one looked at this and that I ended up resolving your bug w/ patch as a dupe of
another one which just got a patch a moment ago. I only just started triaging
wallpaper bugs after i ran into the older report and analyzed the problem.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is not a dupe. Yes, it's exactly the same
issue, but Firefox forked and then rewrote most of winhooks so the patch from
bug 136016 doesn't work. I'll attach a new patch that has the less bogus return
value from the other bug.

Better patch

The same fix as the other bug, but applied to the forked Firefox files. I
should have caught the bogus return value, that was a stupid oversight.
sorry, i missed that, the code looked the same.

I don't mean to be a pain, but I would appreciate it if someone could check this
in for me now that it has approval since I do not have CVS access (mconnor,
Jesse?). Thanks!
I checked in Jon's fix, trunk and aviary.
