highlight "querySelector"

for selected nodes (not sure what the syntax is for a "subject verb" type of command)

with a selected node in the highlighter:

addStyle "style attribute contents" // camelCase? add-style?

add/remove attribute "value"

add/remove class "name"

inspect node // open object inspector on highlit node, maybe command should be "introspect"?


many others!
I guess that's a bit early for that, but I'd love:

breakpoint universe.js:42

and the likes. Oh the beauty.

When creating this list we must ensure that all of the jstermhelpers are included:

$ = getElementById(...)     // ID
$$ = querySelectorAll(...)  // CSS Selector
$x = document.evaluate(...) // XPath
clear = console.clear
keys = Object.keys(...)
values = 
help = window.open('https://developer.mozilla.org/AppLinks/WebConsoleHelp')
$0 = Inspected Object
inspect = open object inspector
pprint = console.log++ ?
print = console.log ?

The initial list of commands is those that depend on bug 689605. (See also bug 693269)


Create a list of commands that could be useful in GCLI embedded in firefox
