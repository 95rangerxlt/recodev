STR:
- open the inspector
- click on a node that's not in the current viewport

Expected: It'd be great if from there, I could easily bring the node in the view, without either scrolling the page manually, or using the contextual menu and choosing 'scroll into view'.
This menu is nice, but it's 2 clicks, and I believe scrolling the element into view is frequent enough that a keyboard shortcut would be nice.

In fact, our old inspector used to auto-scroll into view as you'd hover nodes in it (or clicked?). It was really distracting + a lot of animations/markup mutations can happen on scroll, so we don't want this to be automatic. But it sure is something that a lot of people expect to be easy to do.

I want to try this, but have some questions:
What files need to be edited in order to set this up?
What do you suggest the specific key combination be for this command?
Thanks.

Hi Jon, thanks for your interest on this bug.
> What files need to be edited in order to set this up?
/browser/devtools/markupview/markup-view.js is the file you're looking for.
In particular, there's a keydown event handler defined in this file that we already use today for handling the "H" key (that hides/unhides the current element).
See: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/9ed17db42e3e46f1c712e4dffd62d54e915e0fac/browser/devtools/markupview/markup-view.js#558
> What do you suggest the specific key combination be for this command?
I think it should just be "S", no key combination, so that it works like DELETE and H, etc.

Bug 1203147 - Add a keyboard shortcut for scroll into view in the inspector.

It is working on my local machine. Let me know if there are any changes that need to be made.
Thanks for that patch, I'll test this now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This looks great. I've tested this locally and it works fine.
3 comments though:
- You might have forgotten to add your username/email to your .hgrc configuration file because it's missing in the patch.
- Can you please rebase that patch on top of the latest version of the repository? I didn't apply cleanly for me, I had to merge it.
- Can you add ", r=pbro" at the end of the commit message?
Bug 1203147 - Add a keyboard shortcut for the 'scroll into view' contextual menu action in the inspector, r=pbro

Once done, please re-upload a new patch here and mark it as R+ (no need for me to re-review this).
In the meantime, I'll push the one I have locally to our TRY server infrastructure to make sure tests still pass:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=fb646ec88cf2

I don't think we need to add a new test for this. The scroll-into-view functionality is already well tested, this only adds an event handler.

Ok, here is the final patch.
Thanks. Try is green. Let's check this in!
Thanks for your contribution Jon. Feel free to ask on IRC #devtools or check out http://firefox-dev.tools if you want to find other similar bugs to work on.

I'm really surprised this test would fail after this change ... NI? myself to remember to take a look at this next week.
Yeah it is surprising because it worked for us both locally and it passed the try server. Perhaps we should try checking it in again?
