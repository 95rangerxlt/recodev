Bug 1135045 set fromTab and toTab properties on "select" events in browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml and toolkit/content/widgets/tabbox.xml. Then bug 1144782 made us use the "TabSelect" event rather than the "select" event, leaving fromTab and toTab completely unused. So we should remove them.

The relevant code can be found here:

Did you want every instance of fromTab and toTab, including the enclosing if-else statements removed?
We should just stop setting event.fromTab and event.toTab in the code I pointed to. I'm not sure what if-else statements you mean.
John, you basically only have to revert the following changes:

https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/diff/f4c0e3fd326a/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/diff/f4c0e3fd326a/toolkit/content/widgets/tabbox.xml

Not more.

for the mozilla-central locations.

Hi, I'm still learning about contributing to Firefox. Is my patch already checked into the repository or do I need to still do it? Also, how do I have my contributions show up on my GitHub account?

Thanks.

It has been checked in (comment 9) and merged to mozilla-central (comment 10).

> Also, how do I have my contributions show up on my GitHub account?

Sorry, I have no idea about that. Our primary repository is https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/. I think there's a mirror on GitHub, but it's read-only. I'm not sure whether that's relevant to your question.

Yes, as soon as that mirror is synced it'll show up as a contribution to mozilla/gecko-dev. In fact, I can already see it listed on your GitHub profile page :)
