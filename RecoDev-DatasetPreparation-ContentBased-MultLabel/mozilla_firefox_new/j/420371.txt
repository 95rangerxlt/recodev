The fix for bug 189290 will reuse the quitApplicationCmdMac.key entity for Linux because it's late in the Fx3 cycle to be taking changes to these entities, but ultimately that should be called something like quitApplicationCmdUnix.key or perhaps just quitApplicationCmd.key.

Hello, I have never contributed to Mozilla and would like to take this bug if it still needs addressing. If it does still need addressing, the patch should look something like: 
-key="&quitApplicationCmdMac.key;"
+key="&quitApplicationCmdUnix.key;"
for all instances of "quitApplicationCmdMac", correct? Also, should this extend to instances that are "quitApplicationCmdMac\..*"  (note that only the "quitApplicationCmdMac" would be replaced, not anything after) or only "quitApplicationCmdMac.key"?
Hey John! Thanks for your interest in this bug!

So I think this is what I think we should do:

Here's what needs to be done:

quitApplicationCmdMac.key usage should be changed to quitApplicationCmdUnix.key in here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-sets.inc#388

We also need to change the place where we define what quitApplicationCmdMac.key is - that's over here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd#539

So that entity name will need to be changed to.

No, I think quitApplicationCmdMac.label is still necessary. In this case, I think we only care about the keyboard shortcut.

Once you've got a Firefox build up and running (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Simple_Firefox_build), make those changes, and then execute this command:

./mach build browser

And then restart your browser, making sure the change went through without breaking the keyboard shortcut.

Once you've verified that, we'll need a patch from you. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_generate_a_patch_for_somebody_else_to_check-in_for_me.3F is a good primer for that, but I'm happy to help you through it when you get there.

I'm mconley on irc.mozilla.org - come and find me if you have any questions, or send me email.

Thanks!

I have done this, built the browser, and tested it on my Linux (ubuntu derivative) machine.

I also noticed from searching the repository that "quitApplicationCmdMac.key" is used twice in webapprt, should these be changed as well?

/browser/locales/en-US/webapprt/webapp.dtd

    line 21 -- <!ENTITY quitApplicationCmdMac.key "Q">

/webapprt/content/webapp.xul

    line 48 -- key="&quitApplicationCmdMac.key;"

I have not changed these in my current patch.

No, let's file a separate bug for them.

::: browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd
@@ +535,5 @@

Nit - please make this line up with the items above by removing one of those space characters.

Also, can you add this comment above:

John, not your fault but feedback and review requests with no target ("to the wind") tend to go unnoticed.

Alright, great. Is there anything I need still need to do or am I good?

Nope, I don't believe so. I've set checkin-needed on the bug, so someone will come by and commit it for you soon. Assuming that all goes smoothly, your job is done. :) Just keep an eye on the bug in case it doesn't, for some reason, go smoothly.

Thanks for the patch!

Thanks for the patch, John! You'll see this bug resolved in the next day or so once this patch is uplifted to mozilla-central.
