The insertBookmarkItems thing just Cu.reportError's everything, and then the callback gets called with true.

The reason I was seeing errors was that the bookmarks in Chrome included:

chrome://bookmarks/

which we don't consider a valid chrome:// URLs.

I think we should just ignore all chrome:// URLs we get in the migration. I also think the error reporting should be better, not least for the sake of bug 731025 (which currently wouldn't flag up issues encountered in insertBookmarkItems, like the crazy URLs we saw for IE in bug 1194692).

I have a patch.

I thought we already fixed handling chrome: URIs in another bug but maybe it never got fixed.

Chrome bookmarks migration doesn't drops errors on the floor, and should ignore Chrome's chrome:// URLs
