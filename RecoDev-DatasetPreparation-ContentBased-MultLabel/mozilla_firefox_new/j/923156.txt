Jumbled-up button screenshot

STR:

1. Open UX
2. Enter customize mode
3. Move the bookmark toolbar items to the navbar

ER:

All the other buttons look the same as they did before you dragged

AR:

All the other buttons suddenly look all jumbled up. It all looks fine again as soon as you exit customize mode, but it's still pretty jarring.

Patch v.1

That's what I get for writing a patch on what computer, then retyping it on the other computer before uploading. I missed a hyphen in 'customizationtarget', which meant that the rule in the previous version of the patch didn't apply to anything.

This is the patch from my Mac, and I tested that it works. Sorry about the double-work.
