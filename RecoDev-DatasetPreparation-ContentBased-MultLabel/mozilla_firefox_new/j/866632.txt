Nightly and Aurora, Windows XP SP3

Opening the gcli while having about:home (or about:blank) open and calling |cookie list| shows 'No cookies found for host'. If look at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/gclicommands.properties#774 , you can see that this fails gracefully in English because the host value is at end of the string and blank, but this will likely cause trouble for other localizations. cookieListOutNonePage doesn't seem to be used despite the description.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cookieListOutNonePage) The output of the 'cookie list'
# command uses this string for pages like 'about:blank' which can't contain
# cookies
cookieListOutNonePage=No cookies found for this page

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cookieListOutNoneHost) The output of the 'cookie list'
# command uses this string when there are no cookies on a given web page
cookieListOutNoneHost=No cookies found for host %1$S

The cookieListOutNonePage string is used here http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/commandline/BuiltinCommands.jsm#980

The "cookie list" command allows the user to specify a host (the host of the current page is taken as the default) so it's wrong to assume the current page. We'll have to do something special in the case where the host is null.
