STR:

1. Build moz without the --enable-places-bookmarks
2. Wonder why you have nsLivemarkService.js in your components dir



It should really not put files in there which are unneeded and only used with some other build flag. I wasted 2 hours due to this thing because I believed places bookmarks were enabled fine (was there an announcement about the build flag? I must have missed it) because the file was there, but it didn't actually *do anything*.

gah, wrong bug. sorry.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
