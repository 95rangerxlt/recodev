Remove default livemark

The livemark service does sqlite io on the main thread like the following:

The default livemark has become pretty hard to discover now that we have hidden the bookmarks toolbar, so there probably won't be a lot of new users using it. I suggest we get rid of it so that we're not paying these IO costs for a feature that new users are unlikely to use.

It may also be worth removing livemarks all together as they are very difficult to create anyways and would be better done with an add-on.

Maybe there's already a bug on this? Sounds like a good idea, especially if it helps make Places saner. Livemarks aren't a very good way to read RSS feeds anyway.

bug 622049. I approve the removal of the default live bookmark here, that other bug has some more implication (as you can see from the comments there).

Nope, they are a really minor "problem". practically the only issue is that they are stored in the bookmarks table, once that is solved we have no issues with them.

I disagree, or better, surely they may be largely improved but we are not a RSS feed reader, we never wanted to be. We have minimal support since this has become a pretty common standard on the Web. I also still disagree with the removal of the feed icon, but as I did not impose my vision on that removal, if there's a shared will to remove the feature, I'll cope with it.

Remove default livemark

I have no problem with removing this. It's not visible in the default UI anymore.
I'm quite sure this change is going to fail tests that rely on the number of bookmarks in the toolbar.
You should, at a minimum, decrement DEFAULT_BOOKMARKS_ON_TOOLBAR http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/places/tests/unit/head_bookmarks.js#110 and run the result on try to catch tests in need of asjustements (most likely there may be some importExport test)
PS: to save on resources and time you can reduce the tryrun to Linux, I think there should be no difference from other platforms in this case.
Just to clarify, removing the default livemark from the code does't remove it from users that we got in the past few years, as that's just copied over on profile creation and never touched again.

I don't mind one item less to arbitrate about with new locales, though, clearly.
Concur with removing it from the defaults, and I'll make sure there's no requirement to keep it in place. I think our agreement with the BBC is simply permission/notice of using it, because it does drive a fair bit of traffic. If we remove the link, we should notify them so their metrics team doesn't get confused.

Remove default livemark

btw, this is r- for comment 4
When things are good to go per comment 4, Asa should also be flagged to review for product defaults.
No problems from my POV.

Even with DEFAULT_BOOKMARKS_ON_TOOLBAR decremented, I get the following failure:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=7027825&tree=Try#error0

Any suggestions on how to fix it?

So the test is checking that default bookmarks are imported, this is done by checking that after smart bookmarks there is a default bookmark.
But looks like the test is doing it wrongly (or better, not that correctly):

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/places/tests/unit/test_browserGlue_prefs.js#208
207       PlacesUtils.bookmarks.getIdForItemAt(PlacesUtils.toolbarFolderId,
208                                            SMART_BOOKMARKS_ON_TOOLBAR + 1);

it is checking 2 bookmarks after the smart bookmark, rather than the immediately next one. Since you removed the second default bookmark, the test complains that it can't find anything (it is looking at position 3, but now we have 2 bookmarks).
I think you should just remove that "+ 1" and everything will be fine.

It's likely you should also fix the same bug here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/places/tests/unit/test_browserGlue_prefs.js#239

All of this is fine from my point of view, but I still see a reference at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/generic/extract-bookmarks.py#71
I don't know the purpose of that script though, so please fix it, but get review from Pike on that change.

How are we going to manage this in each locale considering that bookmark.inc is a productization file? Is enough to remove latest_headlines from our file and use this bug as a reference in the commit comment?
bookmarks.inc is just the titles of the bookmarks, and hasn't undergone review ever since it was that.

The old bookmarks.html used to be under review, but just because the links themselves were in the localization.

Thus, this is just a string change as any other.

Thanks Axel, faulty memory on my side ;-)
