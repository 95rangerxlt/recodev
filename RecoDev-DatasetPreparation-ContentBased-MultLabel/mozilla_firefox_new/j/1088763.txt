I would suggest something closer to this.

Slightly darker border.
Agreed, we should be matching the platform as close as possible. Thanks for the catch, Stephen.
The active tab border is going to be a bit tricky. Does there appear to be a better solution than having UX create separate png files I'm not sure what the performance implications of swapping out background images are either.

I'd like to work on this depending on the answer to that question. :)
If my last comment was confusing, that's because there was supposed to be a question mark at the end of "png files".

I imagine we'll need updated versions for the tab-* images in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/tabbrowser/ , yes.

That shouldn't be too bad, they'll be shipped in omni.jar and so disk access should be relatively fast. I think we pre-cache some of them elsewhere on the window, we could add the new files to that set.

Mm... I'm guessing we should get images first. Stephen?

I can do that next week. Leaving needinfo.
This is particularly noticeable now the active window tab strip has vibrancy and is therefore much lighter in appearance than it was before. So the active tab strip can now be just as light as the inactive one, while looking less "solid".

Maybe the *toolbar* of inactive windows should lighten too, to provide more visual differentiation?

adjust-inactive-window-appearance.patch

Patch with updated assets and values for inactive windows.

There might be a better way to do this and it should maybe use preprocess-tab-svgs.py to create the inactive tab images, but that was a little out of my depth.
Can you use overrides for the "normal" images (see bottom of that jar.mn file) to reduce the amount of extra OS-specific CSS necessary here? :-)

I fixed everything else, I think, but this suggestion turns out to not be that simple because we need a different preprocessing character (%), which requires a bunch of python and stuff, which seemed too complicated to be worth it.

Also, I ended up changing the navbar color to match better, which meant making it still lighter. Stephen, can you ui-review that change? There'll be a build from https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c5c12c9a21e9 with this change.

Changed Tab Strip Background

Not sure when, or why, this change happened. But the window background blur is missing and the tabstrip border appears darker. So now the updated tab image is wrong in the opposite direction (i.e. the tab border is lighter than the toolbar border).

I found the where and why, but it means this will need new tab images.

OK. I can't create those images, so I'm going to flip the needinfo on its head so we get new images here... :-)

Looked at this a little more closely (http://cl.ly/image/3k2H1Z2L2k3w). 

Now that we have reverted the background vibrancy I don't see any mismatch between the existing tab image border and the toolbar border. So I think we can just keep the current tab-stroke-start, tab-stroke-end and tab-active-middle images.

Will still need the new inactive images.

Alright, going to keep the needinfo going for those, then. :-)

Oh, sorry, I meant that the inactive images already in the patch are good to go.

We can add that, it's a good suggestion.

hm, good point. I don't know. Per comment #20, I would expect we might be able to actually just keep this as-is? I'll leave it as-is, doublecheck it doesn't look horrible, and check it in, then if it's still not right Stephen can comment and we can revisit if necessary.

Can you explain why the approach from https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/tab-selected.svg?raw=1 wouldn't work? It's already using "%". The point of the preprocessing was so we don't duplicate the shape or styles but now we are…

These seem more relevant than the link to tab-selected.svg... In any case, it seemed like a lot of hassle to set up all the requisite python, and the duplication is not that bad. I also didn't write the SVG files in question and it was not clear to me that they can be deduplicated. They are different from the tab-selected one, and it is equally not clear to me how all the build goop hangs together here. That and these files were already problematic for the build system (bug 1215526) and I wasn't about to make it worse.

If you feel strongly then please file a followup bug.
