Currently trunk only.
Now it's checked in on the branch as well.

As the shortcut works on all platforms, I see no reason not to move it outside
the platform-specific parts entirely.  If you disagree, say so and we can
decide what we want to do instead.

D'oh, it's Delete and not Backspace.  Respinning...

Ouch, thanks for catching this!

r=me.
Actually, I think that key, which is Backspace on other platforms, is called
"Delete". "Del" is the Delete key on other platforms.
Steffen's right.  On pure Mac keyboards, the key in question is traditionally
labeled "delete", spelled out in full.

Looks like we need a new patch here. Please request approval when you've got
that. Thanks.

Nah, the person who checks this in merely needs to add "ete" after "Del" here:
>+          <kbd>Del</kbd>

>+          &shiftKey;+<kbd>Del</kbd>
That's it. Rerequesting approval.
