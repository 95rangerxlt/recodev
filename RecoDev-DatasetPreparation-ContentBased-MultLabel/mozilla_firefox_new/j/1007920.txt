AudioParams rendered in the params view work fine for strings, numbers and booleans, but for other types, they render strangely or do not work.

ArrayBuffer in the BuferSourceNode shows as `[undefined undefined]`
Other undefined properties in BufferSourceNode (loop, loopStart, loopEnd) show up as empty and cannot be edited.

Pretty big patch.

Summary: this fixes rendering of non number/string/boolean values, and can now render undefined, null, and hypothetically other grippable values (Infinity/NaN, etc.). For objects, just the type is displayed (Float32Array, ArrayBuffer), and does not use a real objectGrip underneath (but creates a mock one). If it's necessary to do that and manage the object with the actor pool (which I'd want to avoid as it could mess with AudioNode lifetime rules), that could be implemented (but a beyond me as to how that's done). It's not necessary to do anything with that object currently, and can improve upon this later IMO.

Also, a 10kb ogg file is included for tests.

Sadly, I can only resort to nitpicking whitespace.

Nit: trailing whitespace here.
