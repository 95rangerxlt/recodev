The markup panel currently uses LayoutHelpers.ScrollIntoViewIfNeeded() with center=false to make sure the selection is visible.  This feels right when paging through the list with keynav, but when we get an external select from the highlighter, we should probably use center=true.

The markup view source is in browser/devtools/markupview/MarkupView.jsm - centering is done in showNode().  It's probably easiest to add a center arg to that method, and pass true from onSelect() and false from navigate().
