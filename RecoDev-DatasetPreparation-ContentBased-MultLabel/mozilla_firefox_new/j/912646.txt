Log output after closing toolbox

I wasn't sure if this was a known issue or not.

I am using Paul's app-manager branch (commit 247def72d8 "screenshot over actor") with the latest Keon nightly (build ID 20130904022733).  I can debug apps successfully.

STR:

1. Open App Manager
2. Connect to phone
3. Go to My Device -> Installed Apps
4. Click one of the Debug buttons
5. Close the toolbox

ER:

Toolbox closes, can debug another app.

AR:

Toolbox closes, and phone disconnects unexpectedly.  See attached log.

Here's the corresponding Gecko commit:

That's a (very) known issue, but I don't think we have any bug opened yet.
We are using a (very) hacky workaround in the simulator for this particular issue:
  https://github.com/mozilla/r2d2b2g/blob/master/addon/lib/simulator.js#L1080-L1095

We need to tweak devtools codebase in order to address that in a (very) sane way ;)

Part 1: Refactor debug targets for more reuse

Just a few cleanups to simplify and reduce repetition.

Part 2: Leave client of remote tab open

This patch changes the lifetime management for remote tabs.

If you make a target for a local tab, and then call makeRemote(), target.js creates a client, connects it, and closes it on destroy.  It fully manages the client's lifecycle, which makes sense, and remains unchanged.

If you make a target for a remote tab, you pass in to the target a client which you have already created and connected.  Prior to this patch, the target would close it on destroy because it assumed you have no other need for the client you passed to it.  This patch changes things so that the target will not attempt to close the client you gave it in this case.  The caller now becomes responsible for doing that.
I went ahead and pushed these patches to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=e7af0dfd12d7
Can I land that?
Yep!
