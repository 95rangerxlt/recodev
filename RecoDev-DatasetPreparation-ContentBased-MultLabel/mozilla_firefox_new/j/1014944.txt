Clarify documentation for nsIJSInspector.

Before I had gotten used to Gecko event loops, the comments and function names in nsIJSInspector.idl were confusing to me. Specifically

- enterNestedEventLoop not only enters, but also runs and exits an event loop.

- exitNestedEventLoop causes an event loop to exit once it has finished processing its current event, not immediately.

This patch tries to improve the docs, and spell out some more details.

Should we just rename the method?

Up to you, r+ if you don't want to hold up on that.
I think a rename would be good, but just landing the docs is a step forward, so:
