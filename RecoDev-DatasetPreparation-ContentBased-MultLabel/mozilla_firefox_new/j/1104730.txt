The shield icon in the preferences for the tracking protection is now HiDPI friendly, but is applied in CSS that's shared, while the icon is only shipped on OS X. I should have caught this in review on bug 1091901. :-(

ship bad-content-16@2x on Linux/Windows,

Seems the other in-content stuff does hidpi on linux/windows as well, so this probably should, too.

Patch v2

Just moved all the images to shared/ considering they're the same anyway. Used the Windows ones where available because they've been optimized by bug 1062969.

Note that splinter doesn't get the hg moves/renames right, apparently. :-\

I looked at the patch file directly to see the hg moves/renames. Yeah, it would be nice if Splinter handled it better. Do you know if ReviewBoard does this right? If not, we should probably get a bug on file for either Splinter or Review Board (or both!) :)

So this is the reviewboard alternative. It doesn't make stuff up, but it does fail at indicating *any* renames, that I can see. :-\
