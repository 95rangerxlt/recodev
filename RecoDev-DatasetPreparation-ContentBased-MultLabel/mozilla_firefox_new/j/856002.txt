Bug 723923 exposes util.execCommand and util.updateCommand, but we can probably do better by having requisition.update take a DOM node from which to take the input.

Also this will allow us to fix the potential race condition in how it works now.

Bug 839862 adds in the gcli support for this. I'll use this bug for removing the workarounds.
