about:neterror fails to display with e10s.

str:
1) enable e10s
2) cause some condition that will result in about:neterror displaying (e.g. cause a pinning violation by visiting https://google.com/ via a tool like OWASP ZAP with the proxy's root installed)
3) Observe a blank page in place of the neterror page

Hmm, not able to reproduce using a simple bad address.
Maybe I'm not testing the right scenario here.. Mark, are you still able to reproduce, and are you sure what you're seeing isn't a result of your test config?
downed proxies look ok too.

I was testing with certificate pin errors; I'll try to repro again in a bit
I tried an invalid cert as well here - different about page though.

OK, I am still able to reproduce. Here are the steps:

1) Create some enviroment in which it's possible to get a pin violation from an otherwise OK chain: e.g.
a) Install a man in the middle proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP)
b) Install a local CA root (e.g. by using the ZAP dynamic SSL feature)
c) Configure your browser to use the proxy

2) Visit an URL which causes a pin violation to occur (e.g. https://www.google.com)

3) Observe about:neterror failing to display

The same STR works fine with e10s disabled.
You can always visit https://pinningtest.appspot.com instead of setting up your proxy.

sweeeet! thanks!
Not much to go on except a little log output - 

[JavaScript Error: "NS_NOINTERFACE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsISupports.QueryInterface]"]
[JavaScript Error: "NS_NOINTERFACE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsISupports.QueryInterface]"]
..
We end up in nsDocShell::DisplayLoadError[1], where we attempt to get security info on the failed channel[2] which fails. We end up with en empty messageStr and bail.

[2] http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#4812
On the parent side in HttpChannelParent, we try to serialize security info via NS_SerializeToString, and for some reason this particular channel fails there. So we end up with an empty secInfoSerialization string.

fixed in 10-18 nightly.
