When no window is open, pressing command-K or selecting Tools:Web Search should open a new window and focus the search box.  This works properly on the 1.8.0 branch.  On 1.8[.1], it does not work properly.  The search box appears to be focused very briefly, but focus goes to the URL bar.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Close all windows
2. Press command-K

Expect: search box focus

Observe: URL bar focus

This bug is only manifested on the Mac, where the app may be running without any open windows.

The mac code attaches a load listener to the window and focuses the search box when it fires. (see http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js&rev=1.657#3055 ) I don't recall which code focuses the URL bar on a new load, but if it runs on a timeout which causes it to run after the load event, then this bug would occur. Is this consistently reproducible on the 1.8 branch, and consistently not on the 1.8.0 branch?
Gavin: In 1.5.0.x the focus call on the search bar is setTimeout'ed.

Yes, I know. That's why I asked whether it was consistently reproducible on both branches - if it's a timeout issue, then it could happen intermittently on both branches.

restore the timeout

Moving things back into a timeout makes them work fine for me again.

Oh, duh. I completely misunderstood Mano's comment, I was under the impression that it was still using a timeout.

For drivers:
  This patch fixes a regression in the searchbar.  It has been on the trunk since Wednesday morning and carries very little chance of regression.  The change here is essentially returning us to code that was used in 1.5

Tools:Web Search (command-K) does not focus search box if no window is open

fixed1.8.1, regression
