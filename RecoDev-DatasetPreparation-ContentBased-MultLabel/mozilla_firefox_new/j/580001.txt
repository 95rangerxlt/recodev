I think this is ok, but you may want to combine this patch with however we fix the "tab" with no input bug 583816

This bug is not related to 583816. The error described here takes place when you close the WebConsole using the key combo CMD_SHIFT_K. Whatway we fix the "tab" focus issue, the issue with closing the WebConsole still exists, I think.

Ah, ok! it is getting hard to keep track of some of these things now:)

Check inputValue instead? The test is kind of cheesy (we should really be looking to never throw at all, not just in that specific case!), but I suppose it doesn't hurt.
