Ideally, unchecking the checkbox for "Remember visited pages..." ought to disable all history, and disable the "[ ] days" textbox, but not change the number of days to 0. Which probably means multiple prefs, and some pref migration.

Happily it is only cosmetic..
setting is not rememberd.

check on "Remember visited pages..." and reopen the prefwindow,
it is unchecked.
pkasting said he'd be willing to write the backend code to implement a second boolean preference to control whether any history is saved to make this easier.  Fixing this will be trivial once that happens...
Yes, I know its a PITA to cache the pref value instead of adding another pref to the backend, but its the right way of fixing this, at has the least amount of risk involved.
The requirement here is just to get the behaviour so that unchecking the box disables the text field and rechecking the box enables it, and the value in the textbox there shouldn't change. I'm less concerned with how you do it, ugly hack or otherwise. :)

why not textbox.disabled = !checkbox.checked, like in onchangeHistoryDaysCheck?

unrelated, but ok I guess

Yeah, that looks nicer.

This isn't actually wrong, even if it looks like it is.  ;-P

Ah, forgot to mention this: it fixes incorrect alignment of the "Keep until:" label beneath the "enable cookies" checkbox, making it so the label isn't under-indented.  (It's now very slightly over-indented, but it looks significantly better and is no worse than it was with the old preference panel.  A hack to get exact alignment would be overly fragile and would rely upon the exact child layout of the checkbox binding [which also seems to vary between platforms].)

Patch is in on trunk for baking...

The days-of-history UI right now sucks; this patch makes it suck less with little risk.
I agree that unchecking the checkbox for "Remember visited pages..." should not change the number of days to 0, but I don't think unchecking the checkbox for "Remember visited pages..." should disable the other two history options.

a=drives, and I'll take the blame for the UI that jwalden doesn't like :)
Fixed branch and trunk.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060808 BonEcho/2.0b1 ID:2006080815

check "Remember visited pages..." and set day as "0 (zero)",
reopen the prefwindow, it is unchecked.

but set it non-zero day, it is checked.

intended ?


New history prefs UI needs a little more work
