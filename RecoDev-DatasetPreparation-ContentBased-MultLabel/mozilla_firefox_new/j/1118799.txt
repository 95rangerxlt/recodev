In bug 1096490, I'm replacing the deprecated-sync-thenables promises, which are synchronous, with Promise.jsm promises, which are asynchronous. Doing so causes several tests in the timeline to fail.

To reproduce this issue, simply apply the attached patch.

Only test that's failing is browser_timeline_overview-update.js
According to Victor, the problem is that browser_timeline_overview-update.js assumes that using an about:blank page does not cause any markers to be recorded. However, this assumption turns out to be false. In particular, Styles markers are being recorded. I'm not exactly sure why this didn't happen with the deprecated-sync-thenables, but it must be some timing issue.

What's more, simply changing the test to ignore Style markers is not sufficient: doing so makes the test pass locally, but not on try. Apparently, we cannot rely on the behavior of an about:blank page wrt recording, which means that these assertions are currently useless.

I'm going to file a patch in this bug that disables the offending assertions, with a follow up bug to re-enable them once we figure out a way around this.

Ok, disabling these assertions and filing a follow-up bug to re-enable them later sounds fine to me. We need to move away from the sync promises.
