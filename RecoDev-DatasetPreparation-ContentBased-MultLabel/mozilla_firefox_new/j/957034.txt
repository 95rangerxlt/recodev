Created attachment 8356454
pdf file with blacked out hyperlinks

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

I opened a pdf file in the firefox embedded pdf viewer.  The pdf file was originally created by crystal reports and then downloaded from the pdf viewer and attached here. (notice the double .pdf, but according to a bug report, this should be fixed now)


Actual results:

The hyperlinks ("mailto:") within the pdf are covered by black boxes.  I also tested with http hyperlinks with the same results.


Expected results:

The hyperlinks should have displayed.

I can confirm but please do not upload sensitive data as a testcase.
Created attachment 8357008
new testcase (with fake data)

This replaces the original test case in which the problem was confirmed, but removes the sensitive data.
I have uploaded a new test case with all data dummied out.  (I was afraid if I did this in the original, it might get the blame for the problem).  While this is data from a public website, you are right in that it would be better to not have sensitive data included.  Is there a way to delete the original file?
Thanks for your assistance.

The original file is currently visible only to our security group; CCing glob to see if more action needs to be taken here.
