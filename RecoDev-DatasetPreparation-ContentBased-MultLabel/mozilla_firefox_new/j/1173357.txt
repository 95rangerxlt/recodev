Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox on Windows 8 or later.
2. Go to Options > General.
3. Clink the [Make Default] button.
4. Choose Firefox as a default browser.
5. Double click an .html file on the Desktop.

Actual result:
Microsoft Edge will open the .html file.

Expected result:
Firefox should open the .html file.

A regression from bug 1167294. This is because the Modern Default Apps dialog will only change the http/https handler.
We should use the classic Default Programs control panel here. Note that it is NOT blocked on Windows 10.

It is not blocked on Windows 10, but it is a subpar experience as you have to scroll through the list of apps to find Firefox and then click on another button to make it the default for all file types.

The modern Default Apps dialog is only a tiny bit better, but does have the downside that you have described.

Philip, which do you think we should do? If we think one is better than the other, should we make that one be launched from both the startup dialog as well as preferences? Or should we keep Preferences opening up the more "advanced" dialog (which comment #0 is advocating for)?

Please don't forget this bug also affects Windows 8. On Windows 8, the modern popup is much better than the classic control panel.

My recommendation is:
Always use the classic control panel in preferences.
Use the modern popup at startup on Windows 8.
We definitely need to use the modern control panel on Windows 10 since that OS doesn't give us any better options (and the classic control panel is too complex for most people to figure out what to do).

Given that it is questionable how long the classic control panel will stay around, I would avoid using it on Windows 10. Could we restrict the changes from bug 1167294 to Windows 10?
I found the modern dialog had "Set defaults by app" button to open the classic control panel.
Still no luck on Windows 8.

Good idea.

This keeps the control panel dialog for Windows 8.1 and lower in the preferences. Maybe we can assume users who go through the Preferences are more "advanced"?

We want a great support of Windows 10 in 40. However, I am not sure we should take it in beta. Liz will make the call.

For this one thing (several bugs) I am taking it though we are late in beta because I don't want us to lose people who have Firefox set as their default browser.  The rest of the windows 10 fixes will ride with 40 and 41.

I'm not able to reproduce this issue on older builds: Nightly from 2015-06-09 nor 39.0b4 (Build ID: 20150609130336).
With the above mentioned Firefox builds and the latest 39 beta 7 (Build ID: 20150618135210), the .html file is properly opened via Fx after performing STR from comment 0. Tested under Window 8 x64 and Windows 10 x86.
Masatoshi Kimura, could you please confirm that this is no longer an issue for you with latest beta build [1]? Thanks in advance!

[1] http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/39.0b7-candidates/build1/
Did set set Microsoft Edge as default first? (Sorry I forgot to mention it in the STR.)
I can still reproduce this with the 39.0b7 candidate on Windows 10 x64 (This is expected, the fix is only applicable on Windows 8).
I see no changes in behavior when opening a .html file under Win 8 32-bit.

Under Win 10, opening a .html file for the first time shows the panel to choose an app for it. Firefox can be selected and it opens the file. The next times, Microsoft Edge will open the file with no option to select another app. Shouldn't this be tracked separately? 

I'm removing the keyword since this issue cannot be completely verified.

Yes, can you please file a new bug for this?


Firefox no longer provides an option to make it a default .html browser
