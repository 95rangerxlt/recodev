Patch

While I was making changes in the files I also did what was necessary to make the files I changed validate as RDF (if the validator could resolve chrome URLs).

I'm totally unclear what the situation with any tree and l10n is, so after review I'll post a note to m.d.l10n (woohoo!  it's awesome to be able to say that!) about it so localizers working on trunk will know why their locales all broke.

Patch

Thanks, that's a nice improvement. r=me since search-db looks like you just merged index and glossary.
However, I'd like to give the search-db some more love:

Is there a way to make use of "&pref.pluralCaps;"? I tried, but had no luck (got a "not well formed" error).
That would be nice on all entries linking to prefs.xhtml.

Hmm, we should make capitalisation consistent.
We should also make these entries distinguishable. How about "certificate, defined"? Maybe add ", defined" to all glossary entries for consistency.

Nice, please treat the firebird-toc.rdf and help-toc.rdf in a followup (bug 296017).

> I'm totally unclear what the situation with any tree and l10n is
The MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCHH, where 1.8.1 a.k.a. Firefox 2 will ship from, was just opened on the l10n repository: http://www.axel-hecht.de/blog/archives/000205.html
So localizers can finally start working.

In the near future, changes to trunk code in browser/ will automatically get mirrored to the 1_8_BRANCH, see bug 322260.

Yeah, that's exactly what it was; sorry for forgetting to mention that.

> However, I'd like to give the search-db some more love:

I made the changes you mentioned, but I think it's pretty clear the entire thing's rather fragmented in terms of any sort of written style.  As you mention, capitalization's apparently totally inconsistent, nc:name length varies from a word or two to the monstrous TCP/IP length (which is even worse now that it includes a note that it's a definition), and some of the entries are still probably too arcane to be there.  I opened bug 325089 to deal with these issues after the updated version of the patch is checked in.

> Is there a way to make use of "&pref.pluralCaps;"? I tried, but had no luck

No; those entities work by including multiple <span/>s with the appropriate platform-specific classes, so they can only be valid in an XHTML context.  DTDs do support some conditionality features, but I'm not sure whether Mozilla supports them, and it's unclear whether they could be made to work in a l10n context.  Additionally, this method works fine as long as we don't have hundreds of options/preferences, which we never will. :-)

> Hmm, we should make capitalisation consistent.

I made the changes suggested here, but we're still a ways from consistency; we'll come up with some coherent policy in bug 325089.

> Maybe add ", defined" to all glossary entries for consistency.

I settled on appending " (definition)" because ", <foo>" is sometimes used for cases where "<foo>" could be moved to the beginning of the phrase.  I left the caps alone because I didn't think you'd actually made a suggestion on what to do.

...and also consolidated into "going back or forward"; I don't see a reason to make a distinction which doesn't actually exist in where each entry references.

Done.

Done, although only "Importing" was lowercased in the first because the other words are pseudo-proper nouns.

I feel less certain about this change, but we can discuss further in bug 325089.
Patch checked in on trunk; marking FIXED.  Message to m.d.l10n momentarily...

We need this on the branch as well, unless we (and the localizers) want to do the work concerning index and glossary twice.
