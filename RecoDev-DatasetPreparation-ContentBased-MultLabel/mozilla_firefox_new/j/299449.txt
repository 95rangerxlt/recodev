Thanks! :)
Fixed on trunk by my own authority, thanks for the quick and accurate bugreport!
This needs to be fixed on the branches, and it doesn't have a 1.7.x blocking
flag, bah.
*** Bug 299451 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This bug is also in the Mozilla nightly for 2005070205 but, it seems to be
running fine after clicking OK.
bug 299463 is the seamonkey version
Problem exists also in Thunderbird nightly 2005-07-02-07-aviary1.0.1, but T-Bird
doesn't show a error message.
Is this problem also solved by the fix of Benjamin Smedberg?

The suite trunk and 1.7 branch have been covered by bug 299463.
CC'ing jst, this looks like a regression from his recent checkin for bug 297543.

Benjamin: Please get this fix on the Aviary 1.0.1 branch asap!  a=jay
On linux trunk this still isn't fixed; in the fix Benjamin landed by comment #2
hiddenWindow.css is added instead of hiddenWindow.html.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/installer/unix/packages-static#230

Can somebody reopen this bug?
Created attachment 188261

The Linux fix doesn't seem to be checked in on the trunk, and I'm seeing the
problem even on non-installer builds. (i.e., latest nightly needs me to touch
res/hiddenWindow.html.)
Joe, is your build GRE based? If so, it may be the same problem as in Windows
(see bug 299463) where the hiddenWindow.html was missing in GRE creating the
very same problem. The reason is the patch from the secret bug patch from the
secret bug 297543 changed mozilla/xpfe/appshell/src/nsAppShellService.cpp replacing
"about:blank" with "resource://gre/res/hiddenWindow.html". Take note there is a
"gre" in the URI.
Jacek, it looks like my build is gre-based. I'm not positive - all I did was
download the nightly build - but my firefox directory contains the subdirectory
"greprefs," and the resource URL you quoted works, while without "gre" it
doesn't work at all.
verified fixed on Fx branch with Windows and Linux builds from 0706
Still broken on Seamonkey Win32 build 2005070605 on WinXP. 
This is also on Windows Thunderbird 1.0.5 2005-07-06-07-aviary1.0.1
as a workaround I cut and pasted hiddenWindow.html from Fx 1.0.5 to /res
ignore my last comment #24, I had inadvertently installed yesterdays build. 
this is fixed in Windows Tbird build 2005-07-06-07-aviary1.0.1

isn't this fixed?
I don't know the version of Bugzilla on this site, but maybe someone changed the
flag with this Bugzilla bug:
http://www.bugzilla.org/security/2.18.1/
Shouldn't this bug be marked fixed? -- trying to clean up the "regression" list
