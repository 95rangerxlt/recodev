If the last component installed has an error, nsXIEngine::Install will return
E_INSTALL.  nsInstallDlg::PerformInstall does XI_ERR_BAIL, which calls
ErrorHandler(E_INSTALL), but ErrorHandler expects a second argument with
E_INSTALL.  |msg| is used uninitialized, resulting in a garbage dialog.

Prevent the dialog and print a message with %s in the case this happens some
other way.  A toolkit version of bug 261567 would also fix this.
