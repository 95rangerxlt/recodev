Currently, the new History widget doesn't do anything in the nav-bar. One option is to have it open the History side-bar. The other option is to open the Library at the History view.

There are probably other options. We should decide on one and implement it.

Or show the sub-view in a panel - consistency FTW (and it'd be more contextual than opening a side-bar or the Library). I'd been thinking we should eventually abstract out the sub-views somehow, so this kind of thing is possible.

The styling of the panel isn't right, but I think this gets us in the right direction.

Yep, that'd work nicely.

For robustness, might want to add a sanity check for the panel, when opening a subview - ensuring that the node is where we expect it to be (and if it isn't there, move it).

This shouldn't be checking it's in the navbar, but rather that it's in an area that isn't the panel.

This fixes the nits that Blair brought up in the feedback pass and gets the content of the panel to match the styling of the subview.
Also tested it with the Bookmarks widget and it works well.

The function documentation should be updated.

If this is supposed to match the menu panel, then this should be @menuPanelWidth@, as opposed to 23em.
