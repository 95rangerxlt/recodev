Bug 1081093 adds auto-install support for the tools adapter add-on, but leaves it disabled for now.

Once the add-on is ready for wider distribution, we should flip it on.

Enable auto-install tools adapter add-on

Ready for review, but don't land yet, as there still changes to make to the add-on first.

Enable auto-install tools adapter add-on

Let me take that back.

If we land that in Aurora, it will go to beta and release without going through nightly. I'm not even sure we want this to be enabled in vanilla firefox.
Well, we could put it in the Aurora-only prefs, so it's fixed for Dev Edition only.

Or, the current patch could land in Nightly (and be uplifted to Aurora), and keep riding the trains up to Release.

Dave, what's your opinion?  Should Valence / Fever Dream auto-install be Dev Edition only, or ride the trains and install on WebIDE open for any channel eventually?

Let's do that for now.

This will happen in bug 1082584.

Let's land in Firefox Nightly after we got some feedback from devedition ... ironic :)
Okay, sounds fine.  This bug no longer blocks Dev Edition then.
Dave / Axel / Jeff,
Dave / Axel / Jeff, should we proceed with Valence auto-install on WebIDE open in all channels, or leave it restricted to Dev Edition?
I think if they've opened WebIDE, then sure.
I concurr, if they've opened WebIDE, then go ahead and auto install.

I realize I wrote this wording...  

But I think adding "opened" as in "Debug tabs opened in Chrome Desktop, Chrome for Android, and Safari for iOS" is better, to make it clearer that the *debugging* takes place in Firefox, not in the other browsers somehow.
OK. Makes sense to me. I have updated the note. Thanks for the improvement.
