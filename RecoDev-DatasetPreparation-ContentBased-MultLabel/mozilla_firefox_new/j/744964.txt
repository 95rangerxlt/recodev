The click-to-play implementation that landed in bug 711552 used the add-on icon  (puzzle piece) in the doorhangers and popup-notification area.

Since this is directly related to plugins, we should be using the plugin icon (lego block) in both of those locations.

Patch for bug

Untested on OS X & Linux.

I'll test it on OS X & Linux tomorrow, but the CSS is identical between the platforms so I don't expect any issues ;-)

So I guess you'll also want to make this change for the icon in about:permissions. Feel free to make it here or in bug 711618, as you prefer.
I'll make the changes to about:permissions in bug 711618.
