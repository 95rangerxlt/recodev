These are new images for the loading and connecting throbbers. They have a slightly faster speed than their predecessors.

rs=me, didn't look but the small speedup sounds fine.

Shouldn't the color be changed to blue for Windows Seven/Vista ? Green looks a bit weird with the new blue shade of Australis. 

Another question : does this bug concern the throbbers in other UI area than tabs (about windows, list all tabs, ...), because the old style is still used there ?

The Throbber on Vista/Win7 has been green for some time in an attempt to make Firefox look 'More Native' on Windows Platforms.  I myself would NOT was to see it changed to 'blue' just to match Australis, but left to match up with the OS.
