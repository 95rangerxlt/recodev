Moving the tests in browser/base/content/tests to browser/base/content/tests/general will shorten the amount of time needed to just run the "general" tests. Currently when running `mach mochitest-browser browser/base/content/test` the social and newtab tests run as well, which adds a considerable amount of time to the local test run.

The newtab and social test directories will remain as direct children of browser/base/content/test.

After this bug is fixed, the directory structure should look like:
/browser/base/content/test
/browser/base/content/test/general/
/browser/base/content/test/newtab/
/browser/base/content/test/social/

If there is any potential to move groups of test that focus on specific functionality then those can move to their own specific folder.

Patch

Notable changes in this patch:
1) There were many references to file paths within tests. These needed to have 'general/' inserted within the path.
2) There were 3 references to 'social/moz.png', a file that doesn't exist. The file, moz.png, actually existed in the social directory's parent directory. I fixed these references to point to 'general/moz.png'.

I confirmed locally that running `mach mochitest-browser browser/base/content/test` still runs all of the tests, and running `mach mochitest-browser browser/base/content/test/general` runs only the tests in the 'general' directory.
