WIP of patch (Windows only)

As the mockup in the URL shows, there should be a smaller font-size for the identity-box text. The end border on the identity-box when viewing an https-ev site be a linear gradient instead of a solid line.

Screen shot showing w/ and w/o line

Why should there be a separator line/gradient between the site identity block and the URL in the EV case, but no separator line/gradient in the non-EV case? IMO, it is easier to read and looks good w/o any separator, and that would make the EV and non-EV cases consistent. See screenshot for comparison.

This is because the EV case has text shown, so we want to provide a separator between the two text groups.

Emboldened text

Jared, the text should have bold font-weight as in the screenshot I just made.
The font-size of 85% is what that Stephen and I came up with in-person.

P.S. "embolden" is a real word. Stephen didn't believe me:

I think .9em is fine. The .85 that I suggested in the previous comment might be a bit too small.
Please embolden this.

Can you verify the height of this pseudo-element extends from the top of the identity box to the bottom of it (e.g. setting a CSS outline on it to check its dimensions, etc.)?
We don't want it to be only as tall as the font-size.

Patch for bug (Windows, Linux, OS X)

.85em looks too small for Windows, so I stuck with .9em on Windows (which will make it look the same as on Mac).
Can I have some context here? I vaguely remember that we used to have smaller and/or bolder text but got rid of it in an attempt to streamline this. Also note that bold text rendering is different across operating systems; this isn't going to look like attachment 617642 on Windows and Linux.

Patch for bug v2 (Windows, Linux, OS X)

This patch has the same font-size for the identity-box on all platforms as Frank requested offline.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The gradient pseudo-element's height is derived from the font-size, but I'm okay with that, since it's just a separator, sorta like a pipe character.

We're gonna need a peer to r or rs this.

Patch for bug v3 (Windows, Linux, and OS X)

This patch removes the bolding of the text due to platform differences and the way that bold fonts get aliased. I also lightened up the green font color so that it is not as close to black.

You're making the text brighter on Windows on Mac but not on Linux, where it was already darker anyway -- this doesn't seem right.

Increased the brightness on the text for Linux.

It's still less saturated and less bright than on Windows and Mac. Is this intentional?

The colors were different before but I talked with Stephen and he said to make them all the same (color: hsl(92,100%,30%)).

[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): bug 742419
User impact if declined:
Slightly altered look of identity-box between Fx14 & Fx15. The identity-box got a makeover for Fx14 and since this is security-sensitive UI, we want to have the ability to tell a clear message about how to use it.

Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): locally, just landed on mozilla-inbound for Fx15
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): none expected
String changes made by this patch: none
