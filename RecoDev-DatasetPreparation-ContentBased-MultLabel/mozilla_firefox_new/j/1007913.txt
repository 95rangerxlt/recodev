Right now, the SVG element has a set viewBox property, and the dimensions of the svg element needs to match its outer element. Also necessary for changing to side host so that it can be in portrait rather than landscape mode.

No more viewBox? I guess this won't scale child nodes anymore, but that's probably ok.

Also, is the "flex" attribute necessary? -moz-box-flex: 1 does the same thing. If not, you should use display: -moz-box in the css. It's better to have both of these properties in the same place.

Nit: I don't think this comment is really necessary.

Removed comment and redundant attribute -- -moz-box-flex is still needed for this
