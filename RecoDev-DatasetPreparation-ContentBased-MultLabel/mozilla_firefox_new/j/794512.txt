Users should be able to disable the toast notification portion of the Social API, similar to hiding the sidebar.

There should be a menuitem in the social-statusarea-popup for this.

The code in the patch is fine, but I've a couple of concerns (both mentioned in IRC):

* It would be ideal if this menu item was not shown in platforms that do not support such notifications - otherwise this checkbox will cause nothing to change for users on those platforms.  This might not be practical though (and who cares about osx 10.7 - if they were true fanbois they would have upgraded by now ;)

* I'm concerned "Show notifications" is too vague.  Some users may think the notification is the ambient toolbar area, for example.  One way to mitigate this would be to actually show a notification as the option is toggled - eg, when the option is enabled, a toast could popup saying "Social notifications have been enabled" (and probably the reverse too).  This would have the benefit of allowing people to "discover" what the option does simply by toggling it.
Thanks for the speedy review Mark.

I changed the string to "Show desktop notifications" to clarify the affect fo the change.

Hiding this menuitem seems non-trivial based on the multiple ways that users can disable desktop notifications on various platforms, so I left it out of this patch.
5:36 PM <jaws> the detection of desktop notifications seems nontrivial though
5:36 PM <jaws> ok to leave that out?
5:37 PM <markh> sure

Verified that the preference 'social.toast-notifications.enabled' and the menu item 'Show Desktop Notification' for the Social API are added and that users have the possibility to disable/enable the toast notifications.
