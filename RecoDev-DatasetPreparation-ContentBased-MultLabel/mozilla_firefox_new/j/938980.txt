User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131114040203

Steps to reproduce:

Open a non-Australis version of Firefox. Hide the address bar by selecting the following from the menu bar:
View > Toolbars > Navigation Toolbar
Close Firefox and open an Australis-based Firefox.


Actual results:

There is no Address bar. Even after going to "View >Toolbars > Customize..." and selecting "Restore Defaults", no Address bar appears.


Expected results:

Either an address bar should appear on first opening Firefox, or, at the very least, when "Restore Defaults" is selected.

This only happens if that profile has been on Australis before. Try going through the steps with a clean profile. You'll see the navbar appears fine. Go through the same steps with the same profile again, and it doesn't happen. This is because we keep track of UI migrations as an int and we generally don't support migrating 'backwards'. This is also true for other such migrations (e.g. going from beta to nightly back to beta, should there have been any UI migrations, will not re-migrate stuff).

I'm not sure if/how we should attempt to fix this. Jared?
Hm, well we have the ability to run migrations at each startup if we think it is a higher damage (which this is) and also higher frequency issue (which this may not be).

I think the scary part is that Restore Defaults doesn't fix it. That should be easy to fix and would allow advanced users (the type to switch between build channels) to fix the issue.

Yeah, we don't touch toolbar states when people hit restore defaults (hide/show the bookmark bar / menubar per defaults). We could start doing that...
Yeah, just making sure that the Navigation Toolbar is visible.
