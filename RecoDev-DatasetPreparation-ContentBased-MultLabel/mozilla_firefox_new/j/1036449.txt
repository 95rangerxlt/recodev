Downsides:

* Refreshing a page might be annoying in some cases
  But just about to start a coverage test probably isn't one of those

Upsides:

* Coverage will work the way people expect more

What about the use that I start css coverage, visit 3-4 diff. pages which have the same CSS and then stop the coverage to know the real coverage of my CSS file.

This is a very good use case as many people share the CSS files across pages and the file is not completely used one each single page, but collectively, the file's usage is almost 100%.

Devs might want to figure out the extra things that make it almost 100% rather than 100%

That requirement is supported, and isn't changed by this bug.
So after this bug, the csscoverage report won't restart after every (re)load ? but will only start after the first reload ?

No. It's saying the pressing the start button reloads the current page.
Ah, my bad.
