The refresh icon for the new theme is very poor at small size. You can just about tell they are two arrows on hover but normally it just looks somewhat like a blue blob.

Refresh Icon Comparison (Large and Small)

I agree. The refresh icon looks extremely poor at small size.

Here's the comparison shot of the two icons - large and small

I would argue that all of the toolbar icons look horrible when small icons are enabled.  They're are extremely grainy looking and have a rushed to get done feel to them (even the large icons have that feeling).

1) Not all icons are the same size (toolbar and options)
2) Some icons show color outside the icon which looks sloppy and shouldn't be the case
3) Some icons are clipped and aren't centered properly in Tools->Options

Here is a small example of the sloppiness: http://img446.imageshack.us/img446/327/reloadhv9.png

Here is a professional looking reload icon that could certainly be tweaked to include shadows, offsetting, etc.: http://img446.imageshack.us/img446/6629/winstripereloadiconmodifiedgd9.png

This is clearly not the place to be advocating a different icon set to that chosen so please stop doing so in this and the other bugs that you have been spamming with this. Take your comments to the newsgroups where they belong.

My intent was not to SPAM nor advocate a different icon set then the one chosen but point out the deficiencies and sloppiness of the icons designed.  I was merely showing an example to better contrast the sloppiness in design.  My three points are valid and cannot be negated.

New reload icon added to the Main Window Icon Replacement bug, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=345466. Marked this as dependent.
landed the cleaner small icon on the branch with the main toolbar bug, marking fixed1.8.1 provisionally.
Since this was landed on branch and didn't affect trunk, ->FIXED


New refresh icon is poor at small size

fixed1.8.1
