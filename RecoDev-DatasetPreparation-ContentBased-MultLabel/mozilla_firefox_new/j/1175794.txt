- with e10s off, the content script is running on the same process as the UI, and will now freeze the whole UI until it is done traversing the full DOM of the page.
- with e10s on, the UI will be responsive, but nothing will be displayed in the media tab until the content script is done traversing the DOM. On very large page, this could take several seconds.

The goal of this bug is to fix for of these issues.
Tracking in 42 because regression, causes UI freezes.

bug1175794-make-mediatab-fetching-use-task-v1

Refactor page info media fetching to be a task that uses setTimeout so content process doesn't get blocked.

Remove use of variables on this for pageInfoListener. Instead pass variables that you need and return variables that you want to send back to pageinfo.js
Created attachment 8643112
bug1175794-make-mediatab-fetching-use-task-and-messages-v2

This is the previous patch with some changes.
But now we send media data back every 500 elements you loop through
The media tab will continuously update as more media data elements are sent.

I was wondering if this would be the better way to do it compared to the previous patch?

The patch would be significantly easier to review if these changes were in their own patch.

I think this makeMediaTab function should be renamed to something more descriptive of what the function does, as with the current name it seems like the function can't be called more than once without overwriting the effect of the previous call. Maybe 'insertMediaItems'? Or maybe 'addImages' to reflect that it's mostly just a loop calling addImage.

I'm wondering if it wouldn't be easier to have only a single message name rather than having a separate message to indicate the end.

If you want to use a single message name, the way to do it is to append a null element at the end of the array of the last message. Then the makeMediaTab function will detect this value, and return true to indicate it is done, and that the caller should remove the message listener.

Do we really need this global variable? :-( If we do, it should be named gMm for consistency I guess.

Do we need to set it to null at some point? Wouldn't keeping a reference to the message manager from the Page Info window prevent it from being cleaned up when the related tab is closed?

Would this be a good place to set the global mm variable to null? (obviously the unload code would then need a nullcheck).

The mm changes aren't related to bug 1191869.
The page info dialog could be closed before the message listeners have a chance to get removed.
I'm not sure if I needed to remove them. Since the pageinfo.js script would be unloaded as well.
Maybe the previous way we did it without the global mm was better. If you could advise.

bug 1191869 is when you close a page info dialog, but the content process is still fetching the images. If you open a new page info dialog, the new page info dialog would receive these messages intended for the previous pageinfo. This only happened because of the dump statements which made it slow enough to happen. It's pretty hard to reproduce normally.

The solution would be to let the content process know that the pageinfo was closed and to stop doing the content image fetching for that pageinfo.

This ended up with sending a lot of empty imageViewRows for some sites.

I think removing them makes sense. Could we keep the old way, and have the listener remove itself if window.closed (or something similar) is true?

You can skip sending the message if it's an empty one.

How can I check that the window is closed in the listener?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there's anything on the xul window to check that.
Also if the window is closed, does the code in the listener still execute? Wouldn't pageinfo.js be unloaded?

The only way I can see how I would remove the listener is just removing it like I am right now in onUnloadPageInfo().

Would I be able to get the mm in onUnloadPageInfo()?
let mm = window.opener.gBrowser.selectedBrowser.messageManager;
instead of doing a global for mm. There's only one message manager for the selected browser so wouldn't it be the same as the above message manager?

Could you provide more detail on what you would like to see? Cause I'm confused how I would do it.
Otherwise, I'll go ahead and do the global mm and set mm to null when it is not needed.

Like I said, window.closed

You can check it by running this in the Browser Console:

let win = Services.wm.getMostRecentWindow("Browser:page-info"); setTimeout(function() {alert(win.closed);}, 3000);
(close the Page Info dialog less than 3s after running it, and it will show true in the alert).

> Also if the window is closed, does the code in the listener still execute?
> Wouldn't pageinfo.js be unloaded?

Event listeners attached to DOM nodes would no longer execute (the DOM nodes don't exist anymore), but I think message listeners would still execute, and could prevent some of the window from being garbage collected.

> The only way I can see how I would remove the listener is just removing it
> like I am right now in onUnloadPageInfo().

What I'm suggesting is:

  mm.addMessageListener("PageInfo:mediaData", function onmessage(message) {
    if (window.closed) {
      mm.removeMessageListener("PageInfo:mediaData", onmessage);
      return;
    }
    ...
  });

setupPageInfoMediaTab is not a good name for something we expect to be called more than once. Should this just be the insertMediaItems function where we could add a few lines at the top and bottom?

Something strange I noticed.
This is for closing pageinfo before all the media messages are all sent back and a final close message is sent back.

So for the first instance.
If I use Command+w to close pageinfo then dump(window.closed) will be run in the message listener callback to print true.

However if I close pageinfo by clicking the close button then the dump(window.closed) doesn't get run in the callback.

Is there a problem with how the current code works?

Please attach a patch if you need help debugging. By the way, your video shows there are some JavaScript error being reported to your terminal. If insertMediaItems throws, your dump will never be reached.

Hi Florian,
I attached a patch you can apply on top.

The error you saw is this
JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js, line 628: TypeError: gImageView.tree is null

but this isn't related to the message listener callback and doesn't stop the code executing.

I commented out this code so the error doesn't happen in the patch.
/*  if (message.data.imageViewRows.length) {
    insertMediaItems(message.data.imageViewRows);
  }*/

If you could take a look at this as well, I'd really appreciate it.
(In reply to Jimmy Wang (:jimicy) - works on e10s stuff from comment #21)

The reason why you sometimes don't see your dump(window.closed) being printed is that you still have this code in the unload event listener:
  mm.removeMessageListener("PageInfo:mediaData", setupPageInfoMediaTab);

I haven't been able to reproduce this exact error, but I got:
JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js, line 72: TypeError: this.tree is null
when I uncommented the insertMediaItems call.

It makes sense that the tree no longer works/exists when the window is closed.

Removed the global mm. Changed back to an anomymous function for the message listeners.

Still need the isComplete on the message for "PageInfo:mediaData" to execute functions after all the images have been added to pageinfo.

I want to stick with sending imageViewRows every 10 media nodes instead of every 500 elements looped since you would usually be sending 1 element per message.

If we had a page with a lot of media elements. Wouldn't sending 1 element per message be slower than sending 10 elements at a time in a message?

It would certainly use more CPU, but the kind of performance that matters here is perceived performance (ie. is the UI responsive). Before the changes to make Page Info e10s friendly, the Media tab was updated each time we found a media element.

And we would still be sending at most one message per 500 dom nodes. So the case that you describe where we would be sending plenty of 1-element messages is a large page with plenty of images, but not more than one image out of 500 DOM nodes. That's a lot of non-image nodes.

I see your point about UI responsiveness.
I made a new change to just send back a mediaNode everytime it is found. Then you don't have to check every 500 elements if there is a mediaNode to send back.

I _think_ that's OK. But we may have to revisit if the flood of messages is somehow causing performance issues (eg. on a large page with a CSS rule like "* { background-image: url(...); }"). The reason I suggested doing it every 500 DOM nodes is that it matched the previous behavior in terms of responsiveness: the non-e10s Page Info was inserting the media elements one at a time in its array, but the UI would only be refreshed on the screen when we stopped doing JS computations (that's why we had a setTimeout call; to let the displayed UI refresh itself).
