Beast startup times according to:
-
http://build-graphs.mozilla.org/graph/query.cgi?tbox=beast&testname=startup&autoscale=0&size=1.5&days=5&units=&ltype=&points=&avg=1

show a 50% increase in Ts. Judging by

it appears the cause of this regression was the landing of bug 293461

Ts went up by more like 60-70% on beast (Win) and imola (Mac).

Benjamin, can you back this out or fix ASAP?  I'll back this out tonight if no
action has been taken, since we're possibly spinning 1.1a1 Monday.
Hold off and talk to me this (Monday) morning... I'm debugging this now.
This needs love for 1.1a, either the fix in bug 293548 or a backout of bug
293461... but a backout would be painful because other stuff has landed on top
of it.
Time is very short for 1.8b2/1.1a. If we're not gonna have a fairly safe fix
today, then let's back this out.
Asa: I'm planning on landing the patch for bug 293548, which will fix this bug.
My patch for bug 293548 is in, so I think we can mark this bug fixed.
reopening... beast Ts did not come down after the patch landed.

Remove silly "isFunctioning" test that always fails on new -createProfile builds
Ben mentioned that you should verify that the EM cleans up its datasource when
the "extensions" folder happens to have been deleted.  For example, just go and
manually delete that folder, and then verify that EM recovers from that
situation.  I believe it should since we scan install locations at startup to
determine the actual items and then compare that against the known items to
determine what needs to be installed, removed, or updated.

Low-risk, high-reward.
