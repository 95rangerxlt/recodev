We need a new PrivilegedPackageRoot certificate because the original signingDB is accidentally removed. Without this we can't modify current testcases.

Hi David,

May I ask you to review this change? Thanks.

Review of attachment 8688798:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is fine if you update the serial number so it's not the same as the previous root (although, now that I think of it, are there any tests that would need to be updated as a result of changing this root?)
Another question: why not also publish the private key so other developers can sign packages on their own without having to rely on a service that's running on the Mozilla intranet?

Adding the changes to other tests.

To David:
I am working to make the tool in intranet runs on other open server that uses Mozilla LDAP access control.
Perhaps I can put the signingDB to Google Drive and allow access to only Mozilla accounts.

Thanks!
