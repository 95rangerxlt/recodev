WIP measurement patch

Perhaps this isn't possible but there may be heuristics we can use that don't require a reflow.

This patch only runs the onOverflow code if we've actually received an overflow event.

My try push to skip this altogether showed slight tpaint wins on most platforms but it also regressed tresize and dirty places by a larger magnitude.

Any ideas why that would cause regressions? Perhaps your version won't show the same.
Running this using mconley's local tpaint with 1,000 iterations:

With patch: 197.31 (175 - 385.59)

Well, your patch completely disables the overflow code. I could take a guess that when resizing to a smaller window, once we place an element in the overflow widget then resizing is less work as there are less elements to move around.

I think this works really nicely. Update that one comment I pointed out, and it's r=me. Thanks jaws!

This comment isn't really reflective of the code anymore. Instead, it should say that the 'overflow' event may have been fired before init was called.

Skip calling onOverflow during startup if there wasn't any overflowed content before the toolbar is fully initialized
