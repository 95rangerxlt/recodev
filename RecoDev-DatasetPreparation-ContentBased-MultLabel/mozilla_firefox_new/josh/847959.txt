This would sidestep any future issues where we only want public windows when the public/private distinction actually matters.

We're trying to suss out a known user impact here - is an example that within private browsing, recently closed tabs wouldn't be listed?

We'll take a bit of risk now rather than a black eye post-release, given your risk evaluation. Thanks jdm.
