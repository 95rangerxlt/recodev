When closing a private browsing window Firefox prompts that you are closing multiples tabs. It should not.

STR :

Open private browsing window.
Open multiple tabs.
Close window.

You get a prompt with 21.0a2 (2013-02-23)

There should not be a prompt as with previous behavior when in private navigation. A user should be able the close rapidly a private window.

Hmm, yes, there should not be a prompt.  What tabs are you opening?  Do you see the prompt all the time?
I just tested it with a new profile. I opened a private browsing window. The I opened three tabs :

firefox.com
hotmail.com
gmail.com

Got a prompt asking to confirm to close window.
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#6410 is the logic that looks wrong to me. We enumerate the open browser windows, and if any of the other ones have a visible toolbar, we end up prompting to close the current one.

Yes, you're right.  Do you want to take this, Josh?  Thanks!

Nit: this is technically unnecessary as there is a failure case without this check (the test timing out.)

It's a regression but merely annoys, not breaks, the experience so please nominate for uplift when ready if low-risk.

Looks good, small low-risk change, please land today so it's in tomorrow's Beta.

Thanks Gabriel, can you please verify against the latest Firefox 22 Nightly and 22 Beta builds?

This landed on Beta on March 11. Can you please tell me the value of browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID from Help > Troubleshooting Information? If you are using the latest Beta (20.0b5) it should be 20130313170052. If not, you'll want to update.

Can you please confirm you are definitely using the latest Beta?
(Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 is the build available at http://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/beta/

I can't find a build with this fixed.
For me, that link tries to download Beta 4.
Try a build from http://download.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/20.0b5/ .

When I download a build from that emplacement. I does not change the user agent string and it does not fix the bug. I downloaded the french build.

The user agent string will remain unchanged. What should change is the build ID from Help > Troubleshooting Information > Important Modified Prefs > browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID

If the value of that preference is greater than 20130311000000 it should be fixed.
This issue is reproducible on Firefox 20 beta 7 (20130325214615), as well as on the 03/26 Aurora and Nightly.
Could you file a new bug, please? We basically should never reopen FIXED bugs that have landed patches.

I filed bug 854926.

I don't really agree with what you are saying though. When the bug isn't fixed, it should not be kept as fixed. The REOPENED state exists in the lifecycle of a bug for a reason.

I understand doing this for bugs that were partially fixed by a patch, or when a bug regresses the x-th time, but in this case, it doesn't really make sense.

Thanks.

On b.m.o, it exists for when patches are backed out. That's not what's going to happen in this case, and so REOPENED doesn't apply.
I confirm not fixed with build id 20130325214615 20.0
(In reply to Gabriel Mayrand Chadwick from comment #32)
> I confirm not fixed with build id 20130325214615 20.0

Please see bug 854926.
I'm dropping verifyme from this bug for Firefox 20 since we cannot verify until bug 854926 is fixed.
Reverting Gabriel's flag change since I can still reproduce this issue on Windows and Linux platforms (see bug 854926).
