Working on one right now. 
You have to have the title bar enabled to see it.

I didn't know it can be disabled in the first place :)
But indeed it seems like bug 574821. But that is by design, this was made because Firefox Menu was cut of when window was maximized.

Menu bar I meant.

In the description, it's more like 1 or 2px not four.
Mr. Henky, this happens without the Firefox button.

Definitely that, the css we added there - 

+  /* the new titlebar requires this, or content will be clipped at the top of the screen. */
+  #main-window[sizemode="maximized"] {
+    margin-top: 8px;
+  }
+


Needs to be conditional on the fx button being displayed.

This seems to fix it. Basically, if the menubar is 'autohide', set an attrib on main-window that css can pick up on to set the offset at the right time.

Why not something like #main-window[sizemode="maximized"][chromemargin] or #main-window[sizemode="maximized"][chromemargin^="0,"]?
