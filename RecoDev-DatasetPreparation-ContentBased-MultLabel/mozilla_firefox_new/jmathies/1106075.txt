[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
Requesting tracking for 35 as this is a serious regression, but it's probably too late for 34...


This looks like bug 989875... Jim/Felipe, can you take a look?
I wouldn't consider this a "serious regression", if you hit the try again button twice, you switch back to online mode. Just the first click fails.
We end up here in e10s mode, and we flip this offline pref - 

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#2609

but for some reason it doesn't take affect immediately.

Need to check non-e10s next.
same for non-e10s.

Why send this message at all when not offline? Also, can we rename that message to something clearer? It asks for a specific action and it's not about a generic "network error", as far as I can tell.

tested for e10s and non-e10s, appears to be working.
Note the reason why we needed this originally is that the set offline call over PContent is async.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/ipc/PContent.ipdl#448

So even though the set online call from front content.js is sent sync, the io services doesn't alert the content process until later.

So is there any point in Browser:EnableOnlineMode still being sent synchronously?

No. I thought about changing this, but sync sends from content to chrome are completely acceptable, so, I didn't change it.

Still seems like a good idea to be async by default, though, and only sync when the client code actually needs that. So r=me with sendAsyncMessage instead of sendSyncMessage

busted tests
This definitely sounds annoying and we should try to get it fixed as high up as risk/reward make possible but since it already exists in release builds and does work on 2nd attempt, it's less pressing as a tracking issue.  Please nominate for uplift if the fix is low risk.

fix test

This fixes the non-e10s test, and it also goes a long way toward fixing the e10s test. Unfortunately working on this exposed a weird bug down in our socket transport code related to running tests which needs to be fixed before the e10s test can be enabled again.
Turns out the failures in bug 1113829 are common to all sorts of debug tests when e10s is enabled. I'm going to land this with the non-e10s test update and worry about bug 1113829 later.
