Unfortunately the places controller code is a bit trickier:

At Chromium, if Chromium has already open the private browsing window, this feature of Chromium opens a new tab in its private window.

Opera & IE10 does not have this feature.
(it's needles to say about Safari)

Umm...
Ideally, we should implement the chromium behavior.
But it need not to set high priority to this, from the current status of others.

Oops. I did typo:
But it *may* not need to set high priority to this.
Good idea, but it won't block us from shipping.

Josh, why do you think this will be tricky?
Trickier than the other frontend stuff so far, since we don't have any mechanism to cause a private window to be opened through openUILinkIn/openLinkIn yet.

Oh, right, yes.  But doing that should not be very difficult... (famous last words ;)
How about the extending openUILinkIn/openLinkIn to open private-window?

calling like this:
openUILinkIn(url, "private-window", aAllowThirdPartyFixup, aPostData, aReferrerURI);

That is also an option.

new-private-window

This came up in a reddit thread. Implementing the behavior that we always open a new private window is easy. For the suggested behavior of opening in an exisiting private window is harder, but we don't seem to do that for normal links either. The private icon next to the context-menu somehow doesn't show up for me.
Seems reasonable to me. Definitely something mak should look at, though.

If I choose "Open in a new Window" while I'm in a private window, the new window is private already, so the "Open in a new Private Window" doesn't make any sense there. It should be hidden when we are in a PB window.

in the past we had an hideifprivatebrowsing attibute that has been broken when we moved from global pb to per-window pb, it is still set on placesContext_deleteHost even if now it's a no-op... we could resuscitate that attribute (TBD whether it still makes sense for deleteHost) and use it to hide context menuitem if the window is a pb window (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/places/content/controller.js#604)

I'd prefer to keep "where" compatibility with openUILinkIn, let's just add an optional "aPrivate" argument to PlacesUIUtils.openNodeIn and this.

please align the label with its accesskey, it's ok if they are not aligned with the rest

This works in the Library, but what about the browser?

just in case, let's give it a default bool value. aPrivate=false

but please, verify that by doing so, Open in a new Window from a PB window (that should be the only available option at this point), still opens a PB window. I think this happens at a lower level so there should be no problem, but I'd still be nice to test explicitly.
Opening a new window from an already private window continues to work correctly.
