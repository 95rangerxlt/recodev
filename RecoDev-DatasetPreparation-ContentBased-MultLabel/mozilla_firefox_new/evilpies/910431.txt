Review of attachment 796866:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are some other implementations of nsIContentPermissionRequest. Most of them are ok, but the one in DesktopNotification.cpp also throws.  And there's http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/nsContentPermissionHelper.cpp#88 which throws under certain circumstances and I'm not sure if that one needs to be changed. Do you know when is that one used?

Ups don't know why I didn't fix.

This is actually the one we use in the e10s case. It proxies some of the stuff, and is the only thing that implements cross process requests. If we have no mParent doing anything with this object will throw, so we might as well do it early.
