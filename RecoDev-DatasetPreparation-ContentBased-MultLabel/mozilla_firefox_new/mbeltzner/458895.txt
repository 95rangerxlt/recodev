rebrand to Mozilla Firefox 3.1 Beta 1

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #407275 +++

Renaming for purposes of the beta. This should be applied to mozilla-central, then the tree tagged for building, then this should be backed out. AIUI, that can all be done in the same changeset now. Huzzah!

[backed out] rebrand to Mozilla Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 (no, reall)

<mconnor> wasn't there supposed to be something else?
<beltzner> naw, I cloned the patch entirely
<mconnor> I was pretty sure there was supposed to be something else
<beltzner> trust me, dude
<mconnor> yeah, so this last bit that says "add a !define NO_INSTDIR_FROM_REG"?
<beltzner> oh
<beltzner> ...
<beltzner> thank you, module owner!

Not quite, unfortunately. The process will be:
I land this patch (one changeset)
I kick-off automation (which will commit 3 more changesets)
After mozilla-central is tagged&branched I will back-out the patch (one changeset)
