A couple of preference panel cleanups with no l10n effects:

 - move the "Show Passwords" button to be right-aligned like the other buttons
 - add a "Clear Now" button to Advanced > Network > Cache

Patch pending.

moves and adds buttons, function to js file

Apparently this works better when the function I call, you know, actually exists. This time I actually tested it and it does, indeed, clear the cache.
Gavin points out that the button doesn't really give any feedback that it's done anything at all. Lucy points out that this is also true of the "Clear Now" button. I think a good (if somewhat fake) solution for this would be to disable the button after it's clicked, but re-enable it when the prefwindow blurs, as until that point it would be impossible to reaccumulate private data. If there's a better way to listen for changes to cache/private data entries, that would be even better.

Either way, that feels like a separate bug.

I'll fix a little style nit here on checkin.

Drivers: low risk fix for medium gain usability increase. The patch contains some absolutely safe XUL changes and also copies an existing function (for cache clearing) into advanced.js to allow us to clear the cache from the prefpane; this makes the task of clearing the cache much easier for web developers and other users who must do it often. Adding new code, not changing existing, so there's no chance of causing regressions in other areas.
