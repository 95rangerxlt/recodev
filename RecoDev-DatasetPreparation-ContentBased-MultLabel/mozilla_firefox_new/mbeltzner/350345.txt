it might be left over from the days when the selected tab was 1px higher?
Who are you, and what have you done with the Seth Spitzer who added several patches to bug 349187 yesterday to move them even higher, because that's putting back the extra height? Seems like this bug at least depends on that (and is also a duplicate of bug 349647).

curse my evil twin, I can't believe I gave him my bugzilla password.

But he made those patches before I chatted with mconnor.  See bug #349187 comment #12.

perhaps this bug should go to asaf?

Fixed by 349647. Bug 349187 carries the debate about whether or not the active tab should be "taller" than inactive ones.
