If I visit a page and it is hidden but not typed (this happens when you visit a bookmark for the first time), it doesn't get unhidden. The hidden update rule for changing URLs should be the same as creating new ones.

Fixed by the patch in bug 317839 with the addition of GetUpdatedHiddenState to nsNavHistory.cpp
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
