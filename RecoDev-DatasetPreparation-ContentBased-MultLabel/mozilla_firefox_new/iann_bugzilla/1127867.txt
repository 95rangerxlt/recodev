it looks reasonable, and I hated maxBytes from the beginning.

looks like you removed usage of numScanning, should also remove its definition.

totalBytes (let's keep the unit). is at least slightly clearer than maxBytes.

let [size, unit] =

Should this be:
this.target.exists = false;
instead?

Good catch! Mind to file a new bug to fix the typo? :-)
