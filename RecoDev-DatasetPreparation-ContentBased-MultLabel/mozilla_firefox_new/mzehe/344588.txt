Requires WindowEyes 5.5K and a Firefox build with the newly reorganized preferences window (bug 340677).

Step to reproduce:

1. Tools / Options / Advanced / Encryption
2. Tab to radio button in Certificates group box

Results:

WindowEyes speaks "Select one automatically"

Expected results:

WindowEyes should also speak the associated label, i.e. "When a web site requires a certificate: Select one automatically."

patch that links the description and the radio group together so the radio group appears properly labelled.

This patch addresses the issue that currently no label is spoken when landing on the radio buttons. This does, however, not pick up the fact that we're in the Certificates groupbox. Only when tabbing onwards from the radio button group to the buttons, do screen readers pick this up. There does not appear to be a way of also including the caption for the groupbox in the aaa:labelledby attribute. I tried, and it fails.
Ginn, do you have an idea why the caption is not included in the accessible name for the radio group, if I also give the caption an ID, and put that ID alongside the ID for the description in the aaa:labelledby attribute?

Patch with the desired two labels for the radio group. Currently does not produce any different output than original patch.

This patch shows the way I really would like it to come out in the end. However for this to work, changes in code may be required for the ID of the XUL:caption to be linked in properly.

I'm not sure.
Macro,

that's a bug. sigh.
Technically caption is not a label.
And we don't create accessible object for caption, we create an accessible object for the label inside it. 

Check accessible/src/base/nsAccessible.cpp
nsAccessible::AppendFlatStringFromContentNode
Line 1587-1600

BTW: there's a typo in your patch
control="certselection" should be control="certSelection"

certselection should be
certSelection

It's case-sensitive.

OK, so the "only" part is: How do I reference that label from another control to have it describe/label something? :-)

Thanks for the pointer! That's a part I actually didn't touch, so the typo has been there all along. I've corrected it and will put up a new patch soon.
So the remaining question is: Do I have a means to reference that label, or is this currently impossible?

If you want to have the <caption> as part of the accessible name for radio group.
You can file a bug and assign it to Evan Yan or me.
Thanks!

Updated patch

Addresses typo in control attribute.
I will add a bug for the caption that cannot be referenced by aaa:labelledby, as also shown in this patch.
