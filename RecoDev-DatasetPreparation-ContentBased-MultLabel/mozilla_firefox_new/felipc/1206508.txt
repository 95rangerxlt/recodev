[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

This problem only happen on Windows7 Classic with e10s.


Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open about:home in 2 tabs
2. Drag a tab and move it 

Actual Results:
 The tab thumbnail becomes wrong.
 The tab thumbnail seems to re-capture the image below of the thumbnail rectangle during tab animation.

Expected Results:
 The tab thumbnail should capture contents, not chrome etc

From the video, this looks like more a gfx problem that was being masquerading by drag-n-drop not working properly with it. Alice, can you record a screen capture with the build immediately before that doesn't include bug 1205398 so that we can see how it behaves?

Thanks Alice for confirmation. This problem is very strange. I think it's unrelated to bug 1205398, but in any case I will back it out while investigating the problem. The problem that made me file bug 1205398 only affects Mac (where the drag-n-drop thumbnail sits underneath the mouse pointer), so maybe we can fix it differently on Mac by making the thumbnail positioning similar to the other platforms.
