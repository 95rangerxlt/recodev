It might be useful to gather feedback about which bugs are driving away our testers. I'm thinking we can just point them to input.mozilla.org. Hopefully this is an hour hack, if not its probably not worth it.

So I put something up that works like this:

- User unchecks the e10s pref in the Preferences dialog, and confirms the restart
- An alert is shown saying that after restart, he will be taken to input.mozilla.org for input
- Browser restarts and input.mozilla.org is open.

Blassey, how does that sound? Screenshot incoming.

Will, we want to get user input from our e10s (multi-process) experiments. Can I just create any campaign name, or does it need some server side preparation before? If I can just create one, I'm thinking of going for:

https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/feedback/firefox/%VERSION%/?utm_source=tab&utm_campaign=e10sfeedback

How can I search these campaigns on the website afterwards?

And is it possible to generate an URL that has some pre-filled input text? I didn't find anything at https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Feedback_urls so I'm guessing not

I just hacked together another option to compare. The UI part is done but then I'd need to send the text through the Input.m.o's API instead of opening it in a tab.

Since the patch for option #1 is done I'm leaning towards it, but if you feel this option is strongly better I can work on it
Will is travelday today from our workweek so I'll quickly jump in. 

If you have targeted questions, we have used SurveyGizmo in the past successfully to do single-purpose surveys. For example, with a survey we can ask why they turned it off, how long they tried, roughly how many tabs they use, and stuff like that. We can also take more metadata in a survey if there is some (non-identifying) technical data you want to collect.

Let me know if you'd prefer that route. Would only take a couple hours on our end to get that set up for you.

Use a text area. An <input> field leads to users providing 1-2 word responses.

That would be a bit better, but it would be a lot more work. This is a standard dialog that it's easy to re-use. To create one with a textarea I'd have to roll an entire custom UI and it's probably not worth for the quick return we want here.
Re-needinfo'ing due to comments 6 and 7. I'll proceed with the patch/review afterwards.
I'm gonna go with this patch since it's ready

I get that this is a quick hack to get something, but I'm not sure this is going to provide useful data.

Is the expectation that the user will keep this tab open forever? What happens once the user submits feedback? How do they submit a second piece of feedback?

Instead of creating a new tab, is it possible to add a link to feedback in the preferences panel next to where the user enables/disables e10s?


On to your questions:

> Can I just create any campaign name, or does it need some server side preparation before? If I can just create one, I'm thinking of going for:
>

Both "source" and "campaign" are free-text--there's no foreignkey lookup or anything. Those values are fine.


> How can I search these campaigns on the website afterwards?

The front page dashboard doesn't let you filter on campaigns. You can use the Input API to fetch responses and then filter the campaign down manually.


> And is it possible to generate an URL that has some pre-filled input text? I didn't find anything at https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Feedback_urls so I'm guessing not

There's no way to pre-fill description text via the url. Input's not really meant to be used that way. Short of implementing your own form and using the API, I don't think there's another way to do what you're trying to do.


Hope that helps!
Thanks for the replies. We might iterate more on this but for now all we want is some easy way for users to tell us the reason they have unchecked the E10s pref, to help us figure out what are the next priorities and bugs to fix. We are not looking for more detailed feedback on how e10s is working in general, so I think a detailed survey would scare users away from providing the input we are looking for.

Alternatively, ping the user-advocacy@ team to pull a regular csv dump for you.  We're also happy to provide a summarized/aggregated report on this feedback if you prefer that approach.
