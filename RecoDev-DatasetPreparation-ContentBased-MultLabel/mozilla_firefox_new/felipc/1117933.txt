Go to preferences, uncheck the e10s box. A serious of dialogs will appear and tell you that after Nightly restarts a tab to input.mozilla.org will be opened so you can provide feedback. No such tab is ever opened though.

You worked on this originally felipe, want to take this?
yep
Dave, did you experience this using a local build (instead of nightly build)?
In order to not show most of the e10s prompting all the time for local builds and mochitests, the code responsible for this checks for UpdateChannel.get() == "nightly", which is false for a local build (as the channel is "default").
Removing that condition makes it properly appear on a local build for me.

If you saw this on a regular nightly, we need to dig into it more. Before the restart the code is meant to set the pref browser.requestE10sFeedback to true, and read+clear it after sessionstore-windows-restored on the next startup.

You're quite right, I think this was with a local build. Can we maybe not show the dialog about the feedback tab opening in the case where it won't?

patch

the logic ends up duplicated in the two places but it sounds worth the confusion that it will avoid with that message showing up

Setting as "qe-verify-" as it appears to be a low impact fix.


[e10s] Only announce that we're going to open a tab to input.mozilla.org if we're actually going to do it (only in the nightly update channel)
