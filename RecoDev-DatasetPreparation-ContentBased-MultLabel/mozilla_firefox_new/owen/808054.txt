We have some catch-all code that anchors the Downloads Panel to the tabs toolbar in the event that the downloads-indicator button cannot be found.

We shouldn't really reach that case, since the code that does the anchoring shouldn't execute if the indicator is not find-able.

So instead of anchoring to the tabs toolbar, we should perhaps dump out an error to the Error Console.

Thanks for filing! Adding the [good first bug] whiteboard tag that, as I
discovered while preparing the Development Workshop in Turin, actually may
intersect with the list of mentored bugs (not all mentored bugs are something
that can get fixed quickly).
Do you have a URL for an example?
I would like to work on this, is there somewhere I can see the bug in action?
I suggest you to use the needinfo flag to directly ask specific developers, we get lots of bugmails.

Hey Casey!

Actually, the code we're talking about here is difficult (if not impossible) to get to - so actually trying to *see* the bug is likely not worth your time.

Here's the relevant code:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/downloads/content/downloads.js#403

The "else" condition (lines 406-408) should really be un-reachable - however, in the event that we *do* get there, we'd like to print a message in the Error Console as opposed to anchoring to the Tabs Toolbar.

You can write a message to the Error Console like this:

Components.utils.reportError("This is my error message.");

Let me know if you have any questions,

-Mike
