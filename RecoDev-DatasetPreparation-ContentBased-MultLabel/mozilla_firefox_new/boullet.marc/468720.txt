Hi Marc,  just checking in to see how work on Firefox 3.1 compatibility is coming.

It would be great to get All-in-One Guestures for the Final 3.1 beta due next month.

still stuck at 3.0.*
Version 0.20.0 claims 3.5 compatibility, though it is identified as "experimental" right now.
The current version of All-in-One Gestures seems to support Firefox 3.6.  Resolving this bug.


All-in-One Gestures addon not available/working for Firefox 3.5
