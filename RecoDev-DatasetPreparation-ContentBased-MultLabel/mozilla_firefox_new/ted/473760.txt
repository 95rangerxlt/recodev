Confirmed using

Now to figure out what broke this
Is this broken on 1.9.1 branch?
No. That can be checked by installing / running Shiretoko, making sure another browser is set as default, and trying to set as default.
Nothing obvious has changed that would cause this. A regression range would be handy.
Also broken in latest zip builds
Just rebuilt without a clobber and was not able to reproduce this. :(
After packaging is when this happens
The following build works
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090113 Minefield/3.2a1pre

SourceStamp=9dbded90af2a
bug 467862 caused this... see bug 467862 comment #8
So only packaged builds?
Packaged zip and installer.
I also just verified that running in dist/bin with changeset 19e319a0647b does work
In case you didn't see it in bug 467862 I'm taking tomorrow off and won't be back until Tuesday so I won't be able to help fix this bug anytime soon
Oops, I broke the browser components. I suspect this has to do with SHORT_LIBNAME.

< ./components/browsercomps.dll

Yeah. The browser components are getting built as "browsercomps.dll", but the packaging manifest wants to package "brwsrcmp.dll". Hilarity ensues. I guess I should either fix or remove support for SHORT_LIBNAME. (I'd prefer the latter, actually.)
Wish our unit tests were testing the packaged builds. :-/ (Granted that bug is assigned to me too.)
Pushed a bustage fix, sorry about that:

I've confirmed to fix this issue under Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090117 Minefield/3.2a1pre BuildID: 20090117033728.
thanks all.
This seems to be broken again in build:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090130 Minefield/3.2a1pre

so if anyone can confirm.
WFM with the same build.
Actually it WFM now on a different machine with Vista instead of XP using same build.
