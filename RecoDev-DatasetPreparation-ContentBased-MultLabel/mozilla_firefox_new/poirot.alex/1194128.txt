Similar to bug 1194115, webconsole mochitest chrome test are currently throwing loads of exceptions without even failing!
It increases a lot the logs size while hidding the real failing error if you happen to break any of these tests.

Like bug 1194115, this is because we are not attaching to the TabActor, while the various code we are testing is triggering code on the TabActor that except to be already attached.
