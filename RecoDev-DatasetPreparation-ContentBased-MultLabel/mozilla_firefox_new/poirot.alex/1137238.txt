This is due to the toolbox-close even handling form webide.js:
  http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/content/webide.js#919

We end up closing the toolbox no matter which toolbox dispatched this toolbox-close event. We are racing this code when opening new toolboxes. Sometimes, we are receiving this event for the previously destroyed toolbox, *after* the new toolbox is being created. So that we end up breaking the creation of the new one.

STR are to connect to clock app, open a toolbox and then switch to main process.
It will automatically start opening the main process toolbox and fail doing it with no particular exception.

This issue may be highlighted by bug 1059308, I haven't tried to reproduce it on nightly. But the code itself looks wrong. We shouldn't _always_ close the _current_ toolbox when receiving toolbox-close. Also note that the DOM message event was useful in app manager case, it isn't in webide as we don't have nested iframes. We could just emit an event on toolbox-host of pass a listener in toolbox options.
