Today, if we send an unrecognized packet to a protocol.js actor we get in the console:
console.error: 
  unrecognizedPacketType

Hopefully, it doesn't break any test matching for just the error code...

You've now exceeded the number of "?" and ":" I can parse correctly...  If you keep this level of nesting, please change to regular ifs.

Also, your new format will hit the TBPL error filter we are trying to dodge in the case that there are any packet.error values that end in "Error" and also have a packet.message, but are not packet.error === "unknownError".  There are existing errors that would match this case[2].

I think a simpler approach would be to preface all messages with "Protocol error", so something like this:

let message = "Protocol error (" + packet.error + ")";
if (packet.message) {
  message += ": " + packet.message;
}

I think you now have all the credit for this patch ;)

At the end, always converting the packet to a string ends up breaking
a webaudio actor test that was expecting an object with type and message attributes.

Here is a new version, similar to the first patch but with if statements.

Hmm, maybe we should just tweak the webaudio test then?  Because your most recent patch still has the possibility of triggering the TBPL error filter that we are trying to avoid.

I would prefer not to. I don't think it is a good idea to coalesce *all*
exceptions into a string.

In this patch, I'm using if blocks and only convert to TBPL-friendly strings
exceptions that have error and message attributes.

Okay, seems reasonable enough to me.
