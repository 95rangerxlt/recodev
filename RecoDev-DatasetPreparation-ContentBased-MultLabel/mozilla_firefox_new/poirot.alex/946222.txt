For now, gaia instanciates TouchEventHandler on its own, via its helper addon and totally bypass Responsive mode touch event button/codepath.

I'd like to have only one codepath for touch event support on Firefox,
unfortunately, Reponsive mode codepath doesn't work yet with gaia.

That's because we should listen for mouse events on the frame (ie the <browser> element), not on the content window.

What about using the chromeEventHandler in touch-events.js instead?

> let chromeEventHandler = window.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIInterfaceRequestor)
>                         .getInterface(Ci.nsIWebNavigation)
>                         .QueryInterface(Ci.nsIDocShell)
>                         .chromeEventHandler;

Talked to Alex. It's up to the consumer to make sure we pass a chromeEventHandler.
