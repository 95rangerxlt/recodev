So far, you had to manually install and run adb forward command to make the app manager connect to a device. But thanks to the work being done in the simulator addon, we can ship an helper addon in order to ship adb (not the whole android SDK) and run this command automagically for the user.

I started crafting such helper addon here:
https://github.com/ochameau/adbhelper
And I'm attaching an xpi to this bug.

Can you rebase moz.build on fx-team?

JSM - rebased against fx-team

FYI, you don't need to use [land-in-fx-team] anymore. Just checkin-needed works fine :)
