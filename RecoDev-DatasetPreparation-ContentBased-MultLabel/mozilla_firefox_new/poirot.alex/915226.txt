The Start, Stop, and Debug buttons don't function if an app is not yet installed, but currently they appear for all projects.

It seems like they should be hidden at first, and then enabled once we know the app is on the device.

I'd really like to see us implement same buttons that already exists in the simulator:

  update: same thing than what refresh already does, but also install an updated version to the simulation
  connect: install if not installed, launch if not running, open a toolbox

Merge all refresh/start/stop/debug buttons to two buttons called update and connect r=paul

Here is the patch I talked about in each meeting ;)
We end up with same buttons than we were having in the simulator addon.
I added tooltips for these two buttons.

Use Developer Tools (title case) to match what we say in most other places.

r=me, but:

"Connect" is fuzzy. We already use "connect" for a couple of things:

- device connected via USB (plugged)
- device connected via adb (recognized via adb)
- device connected via the remote protocol

In the UI, it get confusing (especially with the adb integration and the first run screen).

Let's not add another "Connect" button.

How do you like "debug" or "tools" ?

I went for debug, as I like having verb/action for button labels.

Renamed button to 'Debug' (finally the right patch!)
I think you didn't upload the right patch (I see "connect").
