STR:
 1. Visit this data URL, or any page with a filter:
     data:text/html,<div style="filter:blur(1px)">InspectMe

 2. Right-click the filtered thing ("InspectMe") and choose Inspect.

 3. Click the filter editor icon in devtools inspector "Rules" view.

 4. Click the presets button. (the 3 stacked squares at the bottom-right)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
 (a) The "Preset Name" field doesn't fit -- it sticks off the right side.
 (b) When the presets pane slides in, the UI for editing the existing filters (the text-input field, the "x" button) get squashed / piled on top of each other.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
 * Preset name field should be smaller (or flexible).
 * Input fields for existing fields shouldn't pile on top of themselves; they should be flexible.


If this is all stuff in a flex container, it might be that we need some "min-width:auto" on some of this UI, to stifle an unreasonable "implied minimum size". (per  bug 1043520)

patch v1

Tested on linux and windows.
I don't know exactly why, but <input /> seems to have a bigger minimal size on linux.
Setting a smaller width fixes this, without actually resizing the input,
flew-grow still takes the lead and ensure that the input takes the whole horizontal space.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tested on all 3 platforms, looks good to me. Thanks for fixing this quickly Alex. We'll need to uplift this once it's on m-c (I'll keep track of this bug and request approval).

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Ensure we uplift back to 44

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Original bug was bug 1055181. This introduced a new tooltip in devtools to edit CSS Filter values more easily.
This patch fixes the layout on Linux (input fields were too big).
[User impact if declined]: If declined, the layout will feel partly broken to Linux users. This is especially important because the CSS Filter tooltip is one of the heavily marketed pieces of devtools in DevEd 44.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Code is in m-c and manual tests have been done on all 3 platforms. There are no automated tests for the layout though (CSS-only).
[Risks and why]: No crash risk with this patch. If this was to fail in any way, the only consequence would be on the size of the inputs in the CSS Filter tooltip.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
