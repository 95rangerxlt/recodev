For some reason on my system, OSX, the initial tab drag and drop thumbnail before we get the actual image from content is black. This is quite jarring.

Reusing dnd canvas and panel. v1

This patch should also fix Bug 1194174. I reuse the canvas and panel, and at each new session I paint the canvas white. I don't have OSX machine around, but I experienced the initial black image on linux as well recently and this patch fixed it. Let's see how it behaves on try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=d9ffc7ed31bb

I will get a mac tomorrow and see if it works as expected with the patch.

Try looks OK, I've tested it on OSX today and the problem seems to be gone.
