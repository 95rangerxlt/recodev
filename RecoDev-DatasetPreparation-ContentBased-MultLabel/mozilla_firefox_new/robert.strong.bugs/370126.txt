First: I'm not sure if this is a valid bug; Robert, can you confirm/deny this?

The NSIS installer writes a binary value of "2" under http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/toolkit/mozapps/installer/windows/nsis/common.nsh&rev=1.12#1668 to a generic protocol handler registry key (AddHandlerValues). But if you look at this key in regedit, it says "binary value of length zero" (not sure if this is the exact translation, I only have a German Windows here). This seems wrong to me, the code comment under http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/shell/src/nsWindowsShellService.cpp&rev=1.43#163 says that EditFlags has a DWORD value of 2, not a binary value of 2. Also with a binary value of 2, Windows hides the "Firefox URL" entry in the File Types dialog (not a valid value?).

I believe the old comment in the shell service is incorrect but this is a valid bug since the value is not being set properly.

ok... it can be a dword or binary.

I'll check a couple versions of Windows and go from there.

patch

a=dveditz for 1.8 branch
Checked in to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH
To verify install 2.0.0.2 RC1, check the HKLM Software\Classes\FirefoxURL EditFlags registry key value, and you will find it is a REG_BINARY data type with (zero-length binary value) for the value. Install the latest 2.0.0.2, check EditFlags again by pressing refresh, and you will find it is a REG_DWORD data type with a value of 0x00000002 (2).
verified fixed for 1.8.1.2 using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/20070215 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre Mnenhy/0.7.5.0 ID:2007021503

the HKLM\Sofware\Classes\FirefoxURL EditFlags key has now a value of of 0x00000002 (2)

thanks for the steps to verify rob.


Wrong value written to EditFlags by NSIS installer?
