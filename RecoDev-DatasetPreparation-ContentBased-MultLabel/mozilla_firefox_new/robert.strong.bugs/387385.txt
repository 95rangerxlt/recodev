While testing Bug 387373 I noticed that when I opened the install.log in the app dir it contained bogus information. It turned out that it was the install.log in the VirtualStore.

To verify:
1. On Vista install a nightly from before this patch landed into the c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\ directory
2. Open the local Mozilla Firefox directory.
   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\
3. Install a nightly with this patch applied.
4. The following directory should be removed.
   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\

Since we now include a manifest this should be a branch build (2.0.0.5 will do) and not a trunk nightly. The rest is the same.
Why is this important to fix on the branch? We've lived with it, I'd rather not change install code if we don't have to.
With the recent landing of Bug 378598 this is probably not as important for the branch since the manifest will prevent Firefox from reading from the VirtualStore. The only problem I know of is that applications that don't have a manifest will continue to open the file located in the VirtualStore when the user opens a file located in the app dir if there is a copy of the file in the VirtualStore. So, if the uninstall.log is edited in any way by a non manifested app there will be a copy made in the VirtualStore and the uninstaller which does not have a manifest will read the one from the VirtualStore during uninstall. I don't know of any apps that modify the uninstall.log so this is rather an edgecase. I do know of app's modifying the install.log as noted in comment #0 which caused some confusion while troubleshooting.

On the other hand the patch has several safegaurds to make it do the right thing so it may be worth it to fix the edgecases.
