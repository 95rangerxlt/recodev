There are several files that will break Firefox if the user does a pave over install on Windows (damn you pave over install!!!).
This patch is intended to land only on 1.9.1, right?
Yep
Argh, we should have gotten this into 1.9.1.6.

And do we need it on 1.9.0 as well?
We need this in 1.9.1.6. And we should probably take it on 1.9.0 too. Rob, can we get this landed tonight if I approve it now?
I can get it landed tonight.
