Marcia/Juan:  We need to verify that this works for Windows 98 and ME once Rob lands his patch.  Please add it to the priority list of bugs to verify with RC1.

This is only needed on the branch since the trunk only supports versions of Windows with DuplicateTokenEx

Approved for the 1.8 branch, a=jay.  Let's get this landed so QA/community can retest with tomorrow's nightlies (or RC1 if we get it).
fwiw, r=sspitzer as well.  testing robert's 98.exe build now on Windows 98
I have a windows 98 box (actually, it is QA's, thanks marcia!), but it is running an un-service-packed version (4.10.1998) of windows 98.

when I run robert's new 98.exe on it, I fail, but not because of DuplicateTokenEx().

I fail because firefox.exe is linked to missing export OLEAUT32.DLL -77

same is true with a branch build before robert's changes.

robert believes that we need a version of windows 98 with service packs to properly test this.

Additional patch checked in to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH - not needed on the trunk
tested using tinderbox zip builds, windows is win98 SP1 with some Updates, like IE5.5

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/20070207 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre

Not working: 1.8.1.2pre: 2007020703 filetime 04:57:28
    Working: 1.8.1.2pre: 2007020703 filetime 19:48:02

Seems Bug 305233 is fixed for trunk only (I can't test trunk, so I won't download)

Bug 305233 â€“ pacifica tinderbox builds and Talkback.exe have wrong buildID, taken from last nightly

Verified fixed for 1.8.1.2 using a Windows 98 Install running as VM.
