Repackaging of Windows l10n builds on 1.8 branch is currently broken because it tries to copy a non-existent file, uninst.exe. From the latest tinderbox log for Mozilla1.8-l10n-sv-SE:
cp ../installer/windows/l10ngen/uninst.exe l10n-stage/localized/uninstall
cp: cannot stat `../installer/windows/l10ngen/uninst.exe': No such file or directory

It looks like browser/locales/Makefile.in on 1.8 branch needs to be made aware of the renaming of uninst.exe to helper.exe per bug 368353.

Trunk repackaging works OK.
