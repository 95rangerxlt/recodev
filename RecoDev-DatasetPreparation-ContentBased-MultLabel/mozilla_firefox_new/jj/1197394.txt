GCLIâ€™s number-type ignores min or max-values of 0 as seen in bug 970625.

E.g.:
>    type: { name: "number", min: 0 },
wonâ€™t have any minimum value, but
>    type: { name: "number", min: 1 },
will have a minimum value of 1.

Could you use:

    if (this.min != null) {

instead?

A test for (x != null) is true if x is null or undefined, where using (x != undefined) is only true if x is undefined, also this is the style used in the rest of GCLI code. Really surprised that this is written as it is TBH.
Thanks for the patch. I'll uplift it to the GCLI repo.

Thanks!
Joe, are you planning to pull this up into GCLI and then back down to Gecko?

Or should this patch land in m-c right now, and you'll handle the GCLI repo separately?
Just land in m-c, I'll sort GCLI when I'm less busy.
Johan, are you able to push this to try?

I typically use a commit such as:

try: -b do -p linux64,macosx64,win32 -u xpcshell,mochitest-dt,mochitest-o,mochitest-e10s-devtools-chrome

for most DevTools changes.
