Now it's not type="password" anymore. Was that change intentional? It looks really strange to see my key readable. :-/

Yes. We want users to save it by writing it down, copy'n'pasting or using one of the provided backup methods. See faaborg's mockups.
Regarding strings in syncGenericChange.properties

Is the mention of "secret phrase / passphrase"  in: 

change.synckey.error = There was an error while changing your secret phrase!
change.synckey.success = Your secret phrase was successfully changed!

intentional (as in, instead of "Sync key"), since all references to secret phrase has been changed to Sync key everywhere else by the landing yesterday ?

I just caught this too. Not intentional, they must've slipped through the net. I already filed bug 594520.

Yes.
Question from localizers: Should "Sync" in "Sync Key" be translated?
(In reply to comment #23)
> Question from localizers: Should "Sync" in "Sync Key" be translated?

That's a good question. I would say no. Sync is a brand name (see bug 596381 comment 11). That said, consistency is the most important aspect here: Firefox, Fennec and Firefox Home should all use the *same* wording in a particular language.
I assumed that both "sync" and "key" would be translated, unless Ragavan doesn't want us translating the brand name.
I know it's a bit too late to be commenting on an old bug...
I also can't find that google group thing for suggestions.

The new Sync UI looks nice, but it would look even better if it used the default set-up wizard on Aero, with it's guidelines.

The text on the current Sync UI wizard is a bit bloated, the titles are unreasonably big (especially the sync key page).

For example the initial setup page could easily be redesigned as such (quick mockup):

Indeed. Please always file a new bug or comment on ones that haven't been resolved yet. Bug 591122 seems appropriate for your suggestions.
