Loop Review V1

Here's what I could catch.

Hey Philipp, any chance you could look at the Contacts UI that just landed in fx-team? (It's not in mozilla-central yet.) There are probably adjustments to do there as well.

For now the video call button does nothing, and audio/video call context menu items are not active, but the rest should work as expected.

Generally yes, but that should probably happen in a different bug.
Also, is there a place where I can download a build of fx-team, or do I have to build that myself?

Generally, you can go to <https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Fx-Team>, select a green "B" letter on the right for the platform you're interested into, click the small "go to build directory" link in the lower left corner, and then select the right file from the list. Intuitive!

I did test on Windows (8) and Linux as well (see #9 in the review comp).
The bugs you've listed all look very valid to me. Some are already included in the comp as well. I will update it to also show the bug numbers and add the ones missing.

Updated review

Updated comp including the issues raised by Romain as well as some bug numbers.
Got a verbal r+ from Darrin the other day, so I'm marking this as fixed.
