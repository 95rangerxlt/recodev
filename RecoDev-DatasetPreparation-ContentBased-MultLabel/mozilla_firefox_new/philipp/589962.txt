I've seen this a couple times before (and have heard of others see it), but had never figured out how to reproduce it, until now.

STR:
1. Start up Firefox,
2. Open a 2nd window
3. Close a window
4. Wait for error

The error is at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-syncui.js#60 and it's happening because the observer that was added in gSyncUI.init for that window is being notified. But the window doesn't exist anymore, so gBrowser isn't defined :(

Can fix this by removing the observer when the window closes (either with an unload listener or a domwindowclosed observer). Or maybe just try/catch & return from the catch.

I'm still getting this error in Firefox 4.
Are you sure what you see is this specific bug and not caused by some other add-on, could you try temporarily disabling all add-ons and see if it still happens?
I don't see any error here.
Thanks for the tip. Disabling and then re-enabling my Firefox 4 addons seems to have resolved the issue, bizarrely. Is this expected behaviour?
No, it's not expected but it's possible that some add-on was somehow using broken preferences and re-enabling it fixed that problem, or such. Btw it's clearly not this bug and add-ons fault.
