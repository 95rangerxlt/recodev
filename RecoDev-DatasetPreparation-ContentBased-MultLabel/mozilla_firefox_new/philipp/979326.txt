After playing around with the customization transition for a bit, I think we can make the transition feel smoother by slightly adjusting the timing.

Here's the code that works really well:

/* Customize mode */
#navigator-toolbox,
#content-deck {
  transition-property: margin-left, margin-right;
  transition-duration: 200ms;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}

If you're comfortable putting together a patch, I'm comfortable reviewing and landing it. Let me know if that works for you, phlsa!
