You need to remove the linear-gradient -moz- prefixes in this file : http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/shared/widgets/spectrum.css#146

While removing the -moz- prefix, you have to adjust the gradient. (left becomes to right for example)

I'm not a peer, so review might need to happen twice.
