I suspect these are regressions of bug 1102369.

Debugger :
Text color of placeholders for empty tab panels are black in dark theme

Performance :
In the "top" tabs, when hovering the selected tab, the tab loses it's blue background

Also, the search input background is too light in dark theme. var(--theme-body-background) would be a perfect fit here.

We should be clear which of these issues are regressions of Bug 1102369, and should be uplifted.  In this case, was the search input background changed in 1102369 or is this just a suggested theme improvement?

This is a regression of bug 1102369. You changed the search input background to a lighter one. You can just compare the search box background in the devtools and in the dev-edition UI, the 2 backgrounds previously matched.
The border-color of the search inputs also changed btw (in dark theme).
According to the patch, you only changed the border color of the inputs, which gave me the illusion that the background was changed as well.

I can't figure out exactly what this means - can you post a screenshot or explain further?

Happens with all debugger panes. You can go to about:blank to test the issue.
Focusing this on the profiler issue, will file a new one for the debugger pane issue
