+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1192270 +++

When executing:

> document.body.setAttribute("a", "b");
> document.body.removeAttribute("a");

The body ends up with "a=null" visible in the markup view.  It appears that this could use a fix in the DOM code for MutationObserver, but there should be a workaround we can use in the Walker Actor
