I've added the 2x icon and pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=039e674eb5f7.

Ryan, can you take a look and make sure it looks good on retina?

Jordan, I'm not sure how to trigger the '.web-audio-inspector .error' element in the web audio editor to make sure this didn't break anything in the UI.  What is the best way to see this?

The web audio editor has an error element, but the functionality to handle assigning error values to audio nodes isn't yet complete, so I wouldn't worry about it!
