Heather, I also made a change to StyleSheetEditor.jsm when I realized there was an extra autocomplete related import while looking into how to do this.  I can break that out into a separate patch if you prefer.

Pushed to try:  https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=618842328384
That try run looks pretty orange with some leaks. Known, or related?

Not known, I'll have to look into this

I had to do some refactoring - it turns out that editor instances were not being properly destroyed if they were deleted.

* Moved resource deletion into the FilreResource intance instead of the tree
* Moved shell/editor destroying into the same place, and make sure to call it not just on page unload, but also when a resource is deleted
* Use shells.destroy() on page unload instead of looping through each resource and looking for an editor.  This simplifies the destroy function and also makes sure all shells are cleaned up.

This fixes the leaks locally - pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=c0c2f4f5ea70

Not sure, but maybe appended doesn't have to wait for autocomplete:

```
this.appended = this.editor.appendTo(this.elt);
this.appended.then(() => { setupAutoCompletion()});
```

Just moved setupAutoCompletion() ouside of appended.
