I'll take care of this - going to use the same code for the separators that is in use for side menu widget so it is the exact same as the other lists
I'm also noticing an issue with the dark theme where the active item spills into the editor gutter.

This updates the styling to more closely match the side menu widget.  Still don't know about the issue with the active dark item spilling over into the gutter (screenshot incoming).

This patch resolves the overflowing issue with the dark theme, and fixes the original border issue in the light theme.  I've pulled in a lot of the styles from the side menu widget.  It isn't exactly the same though, since the markup is a bit different.  In order to get the right border that doesn't show up above the active arrow, I've removed the box shadow and added a third background image that is a 1px gradient on the edge matching the splitter color).

Let's not have a smw_selectionTextColor variable, since it's just a standard color, and we don't have any variables anywhere yet for colors straight from the devtools palette.
