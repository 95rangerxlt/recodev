There are so many amazing key combinations still available to use for shortcuts - we should use one of them for the Browser Toolbox.

We should only add a shortcut if the browser toolbox is preffed on.  Maybe it could be something like cmd+opt+shift+i just to be extra sure it doesn't interfere with anything else (the normal toolbox is cmd+opt+i and DOMi is cmd+shift+i).

This adds the keyboard shortcut, but for some reason it always opens up in safe mode when opening via the shortcut even though it works when clicking it using the menu.

I believe that's because Firefox opens in safe mode if the shift key is pressed on start up, which is part of the key combo. :/

Ah, that is right.  Shift on Windows and opt on osx.  I can confirm by holding opt while clicking on the menu item. I guess we would need to pick different shortcuts per-OS that avoid each key or change the bootup code to ignore the modifier if it is the Browser Toolbox.

Is it important to be able to open up BT in safe mode with a modifier key?

Now that bug 1140183 has landed we can set an env variable for the new process to disable safe mode

Cool!  A bit odd that the process API doesn't let you specify the child's environment directly, but this seems to work well enough.

I've added a line in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Keyboard_shortcuts#Opening_and_closing_tools and in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox#Opening_the_Browser_Toolbox.

Am I right that it is [Ctrl + Alt + Shift + I] on Windows/Linux? I only have access to a Mac at the moment...

Yes, that is correct.  Thanks for updating the docs.
