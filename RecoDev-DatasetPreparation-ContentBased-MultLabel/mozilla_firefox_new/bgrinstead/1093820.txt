This is by design, right Stephen?  I was working off of http://cl.ly/image/3x3Y0616103o/o.

The problem is if you have the black extend all the way to the top there is a weird issue where the blue windows application border on the sides doesn't continue onto the top.  You can see it in the dark lw theme screenshot you posted, but it's way more obvious and looks more off with the solid dark bg.  I think there are some other plans for Windows with the tab strip in the future but I believe they don't include making the dark extend all the way to the top.  This should probably be closed as a dup of 1091012, but I'll wait for his feedback.

If that is the expected effect, so be it. The feedback we've gotten is that it is jarring, and that people prefer the way lightweight themes handle the titlebar. Curious to hear shorlander's reaction to feedback though.

Aside: I feel stupid for not having reviewed mockups for all platforms, as this caught me by surprise.
Because of platform limitations (bug 590945) LWT on Windows are pretty broken looking. They are especially broken on Windows 8 because the caption button cutout is from Windows 7 and just looks wrong with Windows 8's flat aesthetic. Not to mention alignment issues, layering issues and styling problems.

This isn't ideal state even for LWTs. But being a secondary feature has given it a low priority for improvements.

For something we are shipping by default I would rather not highlight the visually broken parts. Instead it was an intentional attempt to separate our chrome from the window like layers not something that is sort of melded but not really (LTWs) http://cl.ly/image/0q2d063Y3n1F

As discussed elsewhere I think we can improve the way this looks and reduce our UI footprint further with something more like this: http://cl.ly/image/3Q3m1m122E0y/o

For comparison you would be looking at something like this with the current LWT approach: http://cl.ly/image/2T11240M3p08

We can do that by just removing the background color from the #TabsToolbar. Brian, is this something that we can get fixed before release (I ask this not knowing what limitations/deadlines we are up against)?

There is a weird gap between the tabs and the overflow controls if we do that.  See this screenshot - https://www.dropbox.com/s/9lu4zllp0dc0qsd/Screenshot%202014-11-06%2010.57.19.png?dl=0.  I'm sure that this is fixable, but it will take me a while since I need get context for how it is working and make sure that any change I make doesn't break something else.  I'm all for updating it this way in Windows, but I'm not going to have time to do it and test it before tomorrow afternoon (when we are doing the merge).  Jared, any chance you'd be able to do it?
We can set the chromemargin attribute on #main-window to 0 to get rid of the  aero border, but I'm guessing you'd like to avoid changing the window DOM for this.

That would be easiest, but I'm a little worried about perf after bug 1088771
I can take a look at this
Created attachment 8518379
windows-fixes.patch

This changes a couple of things on Windows to make it match shorlander's mockup from Comment 3.

1) Simplifies some of the window spacing things since the dark line doesn't intersect with the window controls anymore
2) Uses a solid hover color instead of partially transparent since it's actually now lined up on the window titlebar color (which is actually darker than the previous alpha one to help address concerns there)
3) Set a background color on the new tab button, which should be safe in shared/ since the other OSes have this overlaid on the same background color anyway.
3a) Use less opacity than default for the scroll arrow disabled state since there is so much contrast btw default toolbar coloring and the dark button color.
5) Transparent bg in windows for TabsToolbar and tabbrowser-tabs.

I've tested in Windows 7 classic, Windows 7 basic, and Windows 7 aero.  I've also done some testing with it applied on OSX and it seems fine.

I really need some UX help here.  Here are the options I see:

1) The current patch makes it look very similar to the mockup in the default case as you can see in the above screenshots.

Unfortunately if you put a button in between the new tab button and the tabs list, then the tab stays black but gets moved off to the side: https://imgur.com/49hOC3F.  We could make that background transparent: https://imgur.com/OhCNP0Q.  On top of that, we need to not invert the icons to the right (easy), but then on hover we would want them inverted again if the hover state was dark (harder).  We could also just use the default hover state for these detached buttons.  Matt may find other cases where the current approach doesn't work perfectly.

2) Here is what it looks like with the full black bg including titlebar, which I think is what this bug report is asking for: https://imgur.com/jmUOcF4.  Notice the problems mentioned in comment 3.

3) Here is what it would look like with a full black bg including titlebar, but with a bit of margin to make it look slightly less broken: https://imgur.com/0DMHIi2.

4) Or we could just leave it as is.

But I don't know what the best option is, given the time frame involved (needs to land in < 24 hours)

Comment on attachment 8518379
windows-fixes.patch

Clearing the review.. this gets weird when dealing with transparent buttons on the tab bar, since they need to be non-inverted while the add tab button would need to be inverted.  Since the inversion state is controlled by [brighttext] on the toolbar I think it's going to very hairy to deal with.  I'd say for what we could realistically expect to do tomorrow, it'd be options 2-4 in Comment 19.
IMO, Option 3 looks the best. Let's push forward with that. Thanks for getting at this so quickly!
As talked about on IRC, I would prefer option 1, but if option 3 is the best option for the timeframe then go for that.
There wasn't any time to get this implemented and tested before merging.  It may be better to revisit this and come up with a solid plan for it while under less time pressure anyway.

Naively speaking though, I'm fairly sure we should be able to fix the cutout thing on Windows 8 separately - can you file a bug for this?

I'm not clear about what you mean here - what would be transparent, and what would be the default colors?

IMO for the light theme, background tabs should be transparent so the Windows titlebar color is visible as their background, rather than the light grey. Same for the new tab button.
Actually, seeing this mockup [0], I think it looks fine (scroll down for light theme). I think it'll look odd if we remove the light gray bg, because the selected tab color will not play well with some titlebar colors.

Like Tim, I think the mockup with the light theme looks nice - are you suggesting that the design should change or that it's not looking like that for you with this patch applied?

Erg, that looks like the 2px change in bug 1096542 plus the new background on the new tab button is causing this.  I wish we could set that to 0 without causing the tab shaking problem because it also causes a pretty obvious visual issue in windows where the tabs don't start for 2px (bug 1100578).

I'm going from memory as my tree is busy with other things right now, but I believe that is roughly how it looks, so I guess I take issue with the design.

Try it with an orange/yellow Windows titlebar, no pinned tabs, and the selected tab at the end.
Created attachment 8536605
light-theme-screenshot.png

This is what the current patch looks like on my win8 machine. Note in particular that the blue highlight on the selected tab connects weirdly to the un-selected tabs, and IMO the top border of the navbar here, combined with the 1-2px dead space inbetween the urlbar and that border, and the light border at the top of the selected tab, the grey not matching the grey of the navbar itself, it all makes it seem sloppy and disconnected (4 different shades of white/grey/black in 5px of vertical space).

The mockup shows a border around the gray background, maybe the fact that it's missing makes the tabs look bad.

I can't find any way to deal with this.  There is no element in the background that collapses to the current width of the scrollbox contents (everything takes up the full width of the tab strip.  Matt and I discussed adding an element to the scrollbox for this but there is a chance that it could break compatibility with addons, especially since it would require a change to all scrollboxes.

I see that, we are removing the border in the main devedition.inc file, but I've checked and that rule is no longer necessary (it looks better with the border now on all platforms).

> overflown.

It looks like you mean no right border only on the rightmost pinned tab?  I notice that in the default theme there isn't either (it looks like there is instead a left border on the first non-pinned tab after the scroll arrow).  This behavior seems to change due to my patch in Bug 1121723, so I will take a look there.
Created attachment 8558668

This fixes the customize mode UI, and if you apply the latest patch in Bug 1121723 there will be a separator between the arrow scrollbox and the first unpinned tab (as in the default theme).

As I said in Comment 45, the separator in the default theme is not between the last pinned tab and the overflow button, but rather between the overflow button and the first unpinned tab.  So I just kept it the same, since I haven't seen any specific mockups for Dev Edition that show otherwise.  Attaching a screenshot pointing to the separator in question to make sure we are talking about the same thing (screeenshot is on osx but I remember the same thing in Windows 7).

Ah, I see it now. Yes, we're talking about the same thing. On Windows though, the difference is IMO the fact that the background of the tabs area is different and has a border, and so the lacking border between the pinned tab and the overflow button, esp. if there are other pinned tabs present, looks odd.

I do see what you are saying, but I'd like to still proceed with the patch if it's OK with you and file a follow up bug to request UX help for this case.  Because it's an existing issue (across all platforms) and this patch improves lots of other things on Windows, so I wouldn't want to hold up those changes during whole process of designing an implementing that change.
