The .jsterm-complete-node is not visible right now because the .jsterm-input-node element has a background color.
Type 'wi' and you don't see the greyed out 'ndow' next to the input as usual.  The popup is still working (if you type just 'w' you will see some options above).

The .jsterm-complete-node was the white textbox prompting me to originally set the background on .jsterm-input-node, so just set both to transparent, and control their text colors in the specific part for themes at the bottom of the file.
