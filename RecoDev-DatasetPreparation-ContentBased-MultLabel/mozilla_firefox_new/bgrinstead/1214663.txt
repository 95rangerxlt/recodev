STR:

1. get fx-team tip ( https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/657b0ff4515d )
2. open browser toolbox
3. switch to debugger
4. try to open any of:

urlbarbindings.xml
search.xml
content/customizableui/toolbar.xml
socialchat.xml
autocomplete.xml
toolbar.xml
text.xml
richlistbox.xml
scrollbox.xml

and many others.

Yet at the same time, some other files work, including but not limited to:

content/places/menu.xml
tabbrowser.xml
panelUI.xml
browser.xml
button.xml
general.xml

etc. etc.

I don't know why which files break, but it's making it impossible to work with the debugger in a meaningful way.

The regression window helpfully includes bug 1132557, which seems like a likely culprit.

Gabriel, can you look into this?

Confirmed that this regressed as part of:

... though actually, that regression range is for the toolbar.xml file, but urlbarbindings.xml kept working for longer and broke more recently... sigh. Let me try to find a second regression range.

... annnd it looks like that's specific to my profile. So let's focus on the clean-profile regression and I'll try to work out how my profile is different in a separate bug. Updated STR:

1. open browser toolbox
2. switch to debugger
3. open urlbarbindings.xml
4. open content/customizableui/toolbar.xml

and a blank page (but with scrollbars?) greets you.

I still have no idea why some files work and others do not.
In fact, I see urlbarbindings.xml blank out when scrolling down in the file (and it seems to randomly come back into view after scrolling left and right a bit)..
Ah, in the browser console for the BT window I'm seeing:

Ha, well it's choking whenever it hits a <constructor> tag.

The reason is that this is undefined because tagInfo is a function and it's expecting an array here: https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/0ca9fc878df2ecc2f9d2a279de9d5c3786f9a2f9/mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed.js#L72.

The reason it's getting passed to that function is that it's assigning `tags["constructor"]` and then just null checking (not checking to make sure it's the right kind of object): https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/0ca9fc878df2ecc2f9d2a279de9d5c3786f9a2f9/mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed.js#L93

Can you confirm this fixes the problem?  I will open a PR upstream for CodeMirror if so

Yes, much better, thank you!

Any particular reason not to use Array.isArray when available? Seems CM supports IE8 so we can't rely only on that, but this seems particularly yucky...

Yeah, just wanting to make sure we won't need to make customizations from the upstream repo.  I'll make a note in the PR about Array.isArray though

Can't view source of many XBL bindings in debugger (and therefore can't debug those files)
