This was a typo / oversight on my part

Instead just removing the variable reference as discussed on IRC.  The color change isn't that obvious anyway so going to remove CSS instead of adding it.

That comment made me discover something interesting - the tab-color variable never actually applies due to this rule: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/tabs.inc.css#164.  So the tab-color variable is pointless right now.  We could either remove that as well, or use an !important on the usage here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/devedition.inc.css#286.

Sorry for all the requests in a row.  As I mention in Comment 4, the tab-color variable was never even being applied due to a more specific rule in the tabs.inc.css file.  We may as well remove the code since it won't affect the UI and it should make things clearer.

--tab-hover-color variable in devedition theme causes "Property contained reference to invalid variable.  Error in parsing value for 'color'.  Falling back to 'inherit'."
