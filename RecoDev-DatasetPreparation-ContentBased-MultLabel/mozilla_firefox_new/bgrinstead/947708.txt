Need to use -moz-border-end and -moz-border-start here and throughout the file for proper localization.

Here's how it looks like on RTL.
Same comment in bug 947709 applies here as well: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947709#c2

Let's fix localization for the remaining CSS in a different patch, but at least let's use the proper rules in this bug.

Got it, thanks for the info.  I'm going to upload a patch here that also fixes Bug 947709 since they have become related to each other.

tabbar-rtl.patch

This adds rtl support to the tab bar.  It also fixes:

* Brighter border on last tab
* Jiggle on last tab (Bug 947709)
* Opacity on the image when tab is selected isn't 1 (you can see this by selecting a tab then hovering over it - the opacity shouldn't change in this case).

Bokay! Thank you :)

I guess we can dupe the other bugs to this one now.

Last tab's border in the toolbox tabstrip is much brighter than the rest



Bug 947708 - RTL support for toolbox tabs, fix up small UI regressions from Bug 941579;r=vporof
