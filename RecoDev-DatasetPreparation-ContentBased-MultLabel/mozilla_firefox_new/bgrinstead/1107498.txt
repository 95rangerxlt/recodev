It's the Firefox Developer Edition theme fault's, since any other theme does not have this white area. cf top-right-theme-firefox.png

How come your tabs are in the titlebar in the first place? By default Firefox doesn't implement this on Linux.

Brian, I think we have a bug on the rest of the tabs toolbar not being dark on Linux, right?

Not exactly, we do have Bug 1096180 that is about a more specific problem (the default background showing up during tab closing and/or with tabs in titlebar).  I believe fixing this may resolve 1096180 as well.

As far as this goes, most likely we are missing a `-moz-appearance: none` in certain conditions, like with a customized button put in the tab strip
Gijs, there is a CSS rule that sets the -moz-appearance for non-lw-theme #TabsToolbar here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/linux/browser.css#1775.

Changing that to 'none' for the devedition theme seems to fix this problem, but I'm not sure if this would cause other problems.  If it's not setting -moz-appearance for lw themes, it can't be that bad, can it?

Yeah, moz-appearance: none sounds like the right solution here. :-)

linux-tabbar.patch

This fixes the issue for me with a customized tab bar on Ubuntu.  I haven't figured out how to test that tabs in titlebar scenario, but it looks like the same problem.

Here is a try push just in case gamebouille is able to test it and let me know if it fixes it: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=25d470c1b0ab
