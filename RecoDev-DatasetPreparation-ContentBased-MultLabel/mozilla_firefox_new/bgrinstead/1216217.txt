This regressed as part of Bug 1178726, it looks like an additional parameter was added to _onWorkerSelect causing undefined to be passed in as the workerActor to DebuggerController.client.attachWorker: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/c07248ffb454#l1.90

Trivial fix.. assuming try will be green since there doesn't seem to be test coverage for this (although I'm working to fix that in Bug 1215117).

This broke on Oct 16 in git commit f7c6589364e999902ba5591a46dc7a3ffcb5c459. I guess we don't have tests yet.

This is being called directly from another function, not by the EventEmitter: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/debugger/views/workers-view.js#40
