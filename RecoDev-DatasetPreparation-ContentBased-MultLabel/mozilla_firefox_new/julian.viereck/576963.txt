When you execute

    console.log('hello');

in the console, you get an output like

    <timestamp>: hello
    console.log('hello');

The correct output should be:

    console.log('hello');
    <timestamp>: hello

This is, because the executed string ("console.log('hello');") is added to the output after it was evaluated.
