Currently in devtools/styleeditor but this is a generic UI module that we intend to reuse for Scratchpad (see bug 708213) and other tools.

Let's move in in shared/ then.

Move it.

+    content/browser/splitview.css                 (shared/splitview.css)
 *   content/browser/styleeditor.xul               (styleeditor/styleeditor.xul)
-    content/browser/splitview.css                 (styleeditor/splitview.css)

we should put this in content/browser/devtools/...

(and should probably move the scratchpad and associates there as well in a separate patch).
Shouldn't we land this?
probably!

[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): New feature.
User impact if declined: Addon Compatibility will be affected*
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): on m-c
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): It appears large, but it's really just a file move.

* About Addon Compatibility.

Fx11 is the first version of Firefox with this new feature. The SplitView.jsm file is already being used by an addon we are about to include in the browser. Not having this in its ultimate destination makes using this shared component more difficult. We only realized the potential of having this as a shared library later in the development of Firefox 12, hence our late request.

There really is negligible impact to landing this in aurora. Really.
