Our current methods do not detect this properly. The shell code will need to be updated.

I think the way to fix this is to check the ProgId for the default protocol in nsWindowsShellService::IsDefaultBrowserVista via IApplicationAssociationRegistration::QueryCurrentDefault

This review request is to land directly on m-c.
Registering http implies https by the way. 

It pops up the same select browser window as when you install.  The pref UI doesn't change at all. If you don't select Firefox in the popup it will not update the pref UI saying you set the default (I.e. it works correctly).

This api is Vista and up, we'll need to use GetProcAddress to avoid xp problems. :/

With a NULL parent window handle, are there any focus issues with the main fx desktop window?

Fixed the dynamic load.

We don't need to specify an HWND because the defaults dialog is dismissed automatically when focus is lost anyway.  The call is blocking though in that the next line of code will not execute until the window loses focus or a selection is made.

I haven't pushed to try yet by the way but will before landing.

Hrm, modal dialog calls are best avoided, but if the call throws up the right looking win8 interface I suppose it's worth it the risk.
