Steps:

1. Install an old version of Firefox with the installer
2. Start updating firefox to the latest version
3. When the "apply update" phase is hit, close firefox
4. Uninstall firefox

Expected:

The updated folder shall be removed on uninstall.

Actual:

The updated folder is left behind on uninstall. This basically leaves behind an entire firefox installation on the machine in this folder.

Note:

If I then proceed to install firefox again, it will end up installing to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Nightly\updated folder, not C:\Program Files (x86)\Nightly. This isn't stub installer specific, but likely has do with silent update.

Should be as simple as a RmDir /r for that directory in the uninstaller.
