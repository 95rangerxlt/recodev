The following snippet of Java code, which works fine in firefox/mozilla under linux and windows, fails completely under Mac OS X. Doesn't seem to matter which version of Java is used.

JSObject jsoWindow = JSObject.getWindow(this); // this works fine
JSObject jsoDocument = (JSObject) jsoWindow.getMember("document"); // as does this
JSObject docElement = (JSObject) jsoDocument.getMember("documentElement"); // but this returns null

In fact, all DOM members & methods called on jsoDocument will return null under Mac OS X as far as I can see.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an applet using the liveconnect classes
2. Within the applet, call DOM methods on the JS DOM document through liveconnect
3. Run the applet on a Mac

Actual Results:  
All document methods/members return null

Expected Results:  
Returned the appropriate values for the document in question.

I can confirm this using the test case from bug 329457.

I've been working on that bug for a while, and I believe I have it
fixed in my current version of the Java Embedding Plugin.  With luck,
I should be able to release that version as JEP 0.9.5+e in the next
week or so.


I've just released a new version (0.9.5+e) of the Java Embedding
Plugin that fixes bug 329457, and (I hope) also this bug:

http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/

Please follow the Readme's instructions to install the new JEP to your
/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ folder, and to remove older copy(ies) of
the JEP from your Mozilla.org browser(s).

This was probably fixed long ago.  And in any case the JEP is long gone.


Java fails to correctly communicate with JS DOM through Liveconnect.
