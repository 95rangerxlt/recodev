currently the treeview queries the annotation service to see if a container is one of the left pane containers.

since we already cache those in PlacesUIUtils.leftPaneQueries, we should use that instead.

while here, and since we are removing anno code form here, i suggest to expand "oqAnno" var name, it's not clear what it does mean.
if we are abstracting that to "get name of the query", it should not even contain the "anno" word

The name is confusing, i know one can simply read the javadoc, but seeing a method called isSomething i expect to get a boolean (same would be for hasSomething).
Maybe GetLeftPaneQueryNameFromId, returns the name, or an empty string if this is not a left pane query.

instead of the early return you could probably if/else and return "" only at the end

"use the cached obj" should be better expanded (which cached obj?)
Please end comments with "."

nit: trailing space

r=me with those fixed.

asking approval, reduces queries load when using Library, due to trying to recognize left pane queries in tree views.

when possible, use cached left pane query ids instead of the anno service directly
