Actual behavior

Expected behavior
It's shown when  customizing for me on Win7.

Are you tried with fresh profile. If yes, i guess it's a linux only bug.
Doesn't show for me on linux either.
Can someone confirm that it's shown (or not) on OSX too ?
It doesn't show for me on Windows 7 actually. The steps to reproduce are wrong though, they should be:

1. Hide addon bar
2. Open customize menu
Now the addon bar should show, even though it is hidden by default, as other toolbars do.

So that might cause the confusion...
STR are not wrong, they are just Linux STR. On linux, when the bug was filled, the addon bar was hidden by default (no sure what it is now) ;-)
So, you gave STR for Windows... ;-)

I prefer  "wasCollapsed = true".

>+  if (addonBar.previousCollapsedState === true) {

Either way, remove " == true".

r=mano otherwise.

This doesn't make sense to me - the collapsed property is not part of any binding afaict.

leftover from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug422590.js#56, the test i based this one on.

r=mano
Requesting blocking. Drag-and-drop customization of the add-on bar is not possible if the bar itself is not visible.

Missed this?
The test is also bogus. All other toolbars are temporarily shown with CSS (xul.css). If we ever make this work for the add-on bar, which we should, the test will start failing.

I filed bug 612588 on this


Addon bar should be shown when customizing



Bug 599325 - Addon bar should be shown when customizing (r=mano, a=blocking)
