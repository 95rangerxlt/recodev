delay 4 seconds

this patch delays the initialization of the microsummary service until a few seconds after chrome comes up. ryan's trace showed it took 4ms at startup.

loading microsummaries is likely to delay a few seconds, as they're not critical to startup, and are usually refreshed on a delay anyway.

myk, are there any reasons you can think of why this would be a bad idea?

oh, we also had 100ms win on qm-plinux-trunk02, but i didn't include it because that box is just ridiculous.
