Now that bug 348165 made the links in bookmarks.html strict and only dependent on locale, we can generate that file via a simple set of strings, just like default_places.
This is going to cut down the amount of fileformats just as well as the numerous ways to break those files. And it going to make review of those files a lot easier, too.

I believe default_places.html should be going away on the trunk.

Seth, I actually filed this bug already, axel@pike.org is just another me.

Most of these shouldn't be in locales/en-US, like, the URIs definitely not, both the icon and query urls. 

How many of the titles are we using right now, and how many of those are waiting for the rewrite of the manager?

i moved all of the new properties into chrome and out of locale.

don't know, because the manager requirements for fx3 are not solid, so i've removed them from locale for now.

r=me. Could you add a comment to places.properties that only the title strings should move over to locales/en-US?

If you want to keep the query and icon urls in a properties files, you could split the l10n and functionality part already, that's up to you.

Thanks for getting me on the hook here.

note to dietrich:

I'm very excited that we have:

PlacesHistoryQueryURI=place:&beginTime=-2592000000000&beginTimeRef=1&endTime=7200000000&endTimeRef=2&sort=4&type=1

If you lxr in our code, we use that same value in several places:

/browser/components/places/content/controller.js, line 46 -- const ORGANIZER_ROOT_HISTORY_UNSORTED = "place:&beginTime=-2592000000000&beginTimeRef=1&endTime=7200000000&endTimeRef=2&type=1"
/browser/components/places/content/history-panel.xul, line 122 -- place="place:&amp;beginTime=-2592000000000&amp;beginTimeRef=1&amp;endTime=7200000000&amp;endTimeRef=2&amp;type=1"

Can you log a spin off bug about fixing our code to use the property?

note, we also use something similar, but slightly different, here:

/browser/base/content/browser-menubar.inc, line 334 -- place="place:&amp;beginTime=-2592000000000&amp;beginTimeRef=1&amp;endTime=7200000000&amp;endTimeRef=2&amp;type=0&amp;sort=4&amp;maxResults=10">

For future extension developers, having one place to get PlacesHistoryQueryURI, instead of following our copy-and-paste approach, would be good.

fix v3

mano pointed out that the subscriptions folder is obsolete. this patch doesn't create the folder. it does leave the un-localized properties there in case we use it during upcoming manager changes. we can remove it later if necessary.

fix v4

per mano, the history query is unnecessary as well. leaving in the strings for now, just not creating the bookmark when initializing the datastore. we can remove the strings if necessary when we move them to locale.

please try to keep code lines not that long (in browser/ I would mumble something about 80 character).

Hrm, we don't set favicons on bookmark items directly (the bookmarked uri is annotated).

I would rather though stop setting these icons at all for now.

addresses mano's comments. xpcshell didn't like the properties file in a places/content subdir, so i put it in the global content.
