We'd like to try promoting, in-product, the ability to create a Firefox Account.

We have a lot of new mechanisms to do in-product promotion, post-Australis. We also had some pre-existing mechanisms (snippets!). There are also likely some extensions to or combinations of these mechanisms that we should define.

This bug is to define a few high-potential feature promotion mechanisms for _creating a Firefox Account_, ideally on a spectrum of prominence in the UI.
