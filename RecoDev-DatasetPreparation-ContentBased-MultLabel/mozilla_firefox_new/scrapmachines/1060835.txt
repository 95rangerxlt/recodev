Changed

Honestly, speaking, I based off this file from styleeditor.properties and it had the same :)

I can make them "Http Only" , "Secure" and "Domain" so that localizers can localize them.

These can be treated as non-localizable strings, but it would be nice if they are localized.

Flod, are you able to review string changes ?
Ah, I forgot to mention, that the catch in the  last three strings is that their key can never change. :/

Flod, is it still early enough to have the value change without changing key ?

This thing landed only a few hours back
Basically, once it's landed on mozilla-central it's too late. Also consider the amount of time that will pass between you landing this change, and the change actually making into mozilla-central, it won't be a few hours.

So, to answer your question, you need new string IDs.

In general you need a review from a module owner/peer, eventually I can't give feedback, but not in this case (I'll be offline for a week from this moment).

Is there a way we can track these kind of things, whether string translation has started or not ? Its really hard sitting in blind and just assuming stuff.

Then let the strings be like that, because key change is not possible.

Fixed the problems mentioned by Flod.

Since isHttpOnly, isSecure and isDomain keys cannot change and the values are okay for English (imo), I am just adding a localization note to explain those strings for the localizers to localize accordingly.

I also added two extra strings (and removed one unused) for the menu entries and the panel entries.

(trying to see if I can get a reviewer during the weekend itself in order to land it ASAP)
PS: code is just code, there's always a way to change things. Usually just takes a level of indirection, or a different level of abstraction.

Re timing, once you landed code, it's landed, and things should only land if their UI strings are good to ship.

Yeah there is, but then I will have to map each and every property of all types of storage with their corresponding string manually, right now I just iterate and form them dynamically :)

No idea what you mean here

Nope. "Storage Inspector tab selected"

This character is not visible on Linux. I see this: http://i.imgur.com/PwlP8zG.png
Is it used anywhere else?

locales v2

did s/Web Console/Storage Inspector

about the …, it must be some encoding issue as for me, the dots appear correct. This time, I made sure that it has the same dots as in netmonitor.properties file. Can you try now ?

And thanks a ton for doing this on a weekend :) ^.^
s/netmonitor/profiler
For reference, when you start a profile in the performance tab, the similar dots appear on the left pane after "In progress"

For the dots, it was an issue with bugzilla encoding. So r+ :)
