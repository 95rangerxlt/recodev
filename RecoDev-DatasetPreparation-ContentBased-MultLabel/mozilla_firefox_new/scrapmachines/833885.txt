bug 650804 introduced a class devtools-no-search-result for searchbox with no search output for the given input.

devtools-no-search-result has transitions on box-shadow, border-color and background-image which are all ineffective as the transitions at 

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/winstripe/devtools/inspector.css#221

take precedence, also introduced in the same bug.

As background-image is already no transition-able, best option might be to remove the transitions from class devtools-no-search-result completely to maintain consistency.

> okay, but apparently background-image cannot be transitioned. So having only a border transitioned along with a sudden changing background does not seem well. Removing the whole transition from .devtools-no-search-result seems to be a better option.

Works for me.

Also noticed in this [1] screenshot posted by paul once that the search icon is misaligned by 1 px (the same was happening on Mac) so fixing that too.
