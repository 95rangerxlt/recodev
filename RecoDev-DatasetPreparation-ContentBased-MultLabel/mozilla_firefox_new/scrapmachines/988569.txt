Right now the suggestion appears at many times it should not, like pressing shortcuts (ctrl - z etc), hitting enter in some cases, pressing space in the middle of , say, linear-gradient.

Also, the suggestion is inserted when you press TAB in the value field. This is really irritating.

Most of them are a result of bug 984141

Some minor fixes:

Do not show suggestions popup when hitting some shortcuts using modifiers.

Turns out that while hitting Ctrl + Space, first Ctrl gets pressed then the combo. Ctrl leave the private.doNotAutocomplete as true, which effects Ctrl + Space combo too.

Fixed.
