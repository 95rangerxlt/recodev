Screenshot of misplaced autocomplete list

STR:
0. Set the magic prefs (devtools.chrome.enabled, devtools.debugger.chrome-enabled)
1. Open the Browser Console in a separate window
1a. Move it far enough to the bottom of the screen so that the autocomplete popup will have to be above the cursor (this step may be optional?)
1b. Make sure your mouse is nowhere near the cursor in the console window (or it'll select autocomplete items)
2. Type "g" (you get a long autocomplete popup list
3. Type "H" (the list goes a lot shorter)

Expected result: the list anchors to the cursor (below or above the textbox)

Actual result: the top left corner of the autocomplete list stays in the same position, miles away from the inputbox.

(funnily enough, I can't reproduce this problem with the web console? No idea why not)
Is that HiDPI ? If yes, then this bug is most probably a dupe of bug 855849.l

If you undock the web console, then you might see the same issue.
Victor, this is probably related to the latest changes we did for the autocomplete popup. Do we have a bug about the issues? Afaik we discussed these with the team.
We don't have a bug yet on this, but the behavior is identical with bug 855849 (it seems it's happening on non HiDPI as well).

I would be a lot happier if that bug got some attention instead, since this issue started badly affecting the debugger as well, and I'm not comfortable with setTimeouting everything and hoping that it works. As we talked on IRC, neither MozAfterPaint nor a setTimeout made a definitive difference worth considering "a fix".
I am seeing this now in web console on windows 7 too. and Mihai is prolly right in comment 3, but on Windows, this started happening only around 3 weeks back, so not sure ...

Rebased on top of web console loader and reload marker patches.

new try : https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=22b97be5570e
I was not able to reproduce the bug with STR from comment #0. If anyone else has problems here are my steps to reproduce:

1. open the browser console.
2. type |gooo|
3. then backspace once and repeat until you see that the popup is anchored at a wrong location.

Girish, your patch seems to fix the problem on my system (Ubuntu 12.04). Thanks!

Yeah, I know <sadface>. Damn these XUL panels.

This does not fix anything. In fact, it makes things much, much worse on OS X.

That's... bad. It works better for me (on Linux), see comment 9. Should we backout the patch?
Not sure. It seems to work better on Windows and Linux, so, on average, this patch does good things. Let's keep it. I hate panels.

Can you please explain how it got worse? Any STRs ? I've personally tested it on my Mac OS X 10.8 and it completely fixes the incorrect repositioning of the popup.
Regular usage. See bug 857441.

That doesn't help. Anyways, I will upload a screencast comparing the two nightlies with and without the patch when I get internet access at my home back.
