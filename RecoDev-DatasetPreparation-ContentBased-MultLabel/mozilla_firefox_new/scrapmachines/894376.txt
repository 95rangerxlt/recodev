Well, this does not work in the case when you edit the property first in an already existing property-value pair.

Great job.

Some oranges ... I will look into them today.
Created attachment 782284
patch v3.0

Asking for review again as I have changed a lot of things for the tests to be perfectly green.

Turns out that in the previous approach, there were two setTimeout . One inside the _mayBeSuggest method with delay of 0 and on in the test with a delay of 200ms. Ideally first, the _mayBeSuggest timeout should happen and then the test one, but due to some reasons, in some rare situations, the very first call of _mayBeSuggest's timeout was happening after the call of the timeout in the first iteration of checkState in the test. This was causing intermittents in debug build, all be it very less frequent : https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=40515ff53ee3

Thus I removed all the timeouts in the tests and now am relying on events. So the inline-editor emits "after-suggest" event telling that it has completed autocompletion related tasks. This time, try was green : https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=cd4742cc046b

There are a huge amount of oranges here. Even though they don't seem to be caused by your patch we need to be sure.

Please pull, update and submit this patch to try again. I will review it when it is green.

Those oranges are existing oranges, still not fixed.. see bug 851349

I have personally looked into the logs and my tests run correctly.

I am much happier with this.

The number of trailing spaces in your patch appears to be growing... r+ if you remove them:

hrmm. Weird, my ST2 should have removed any trailing spaces :(
There is a plugin for ST2 & 3 called TrailingSpaces that highlights all trailing spaces and makes it easier to avoid them.
Ideally there is a setting in ST2 to automatically remove trailing spaces on file save.. Anyways, I will update the patch before landing.
