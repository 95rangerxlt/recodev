revert back to correct url

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/2fd3d3b584d8#l6.231 reverted back the console's arrow to the old image which is now not present.

The patch fixes that.

I know I did this in my patch for Bug 884887 - 100% sure, because I did check what you changed. Maybe I failed to save the change...

Thanks for the catch and for the fix!

fix for the input background

This adds the .jsterm-input-container background:white styling bac for macos. Should we add it for the other systems as well? It wasn't there for the others...

I don't think this is the right patch :)
And, yes, I believe the white background should be added to all platforms, because the styling issues exists on all platforms.

fix for the input background - the correct patch

Hah, I attached the wrong patch. This should be the correct one. Also, I moved jsterm-input-container background:white to shared/webconsole.inc.css as requested.
