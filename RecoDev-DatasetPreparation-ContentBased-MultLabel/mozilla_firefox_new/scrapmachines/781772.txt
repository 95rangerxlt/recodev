"I" is free, and it would make more sense to have the first alphabet as accesskey, rather than the last.

If any specific reason is there, feel free to close the bug.

It would also leave free "T" to be the accesskey for "Timeline"

This is why: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=565872#c9

And afaik, it's not valid anymore.
Then we should go ahead and do this. It would be small change. I will try to create the patch, but I will have to setup the repo and all the tools first.
I am taking it, the patch is very small, does it require any ui0review or something like that ?
I really want the "t" accesskey :P

Changing the T to I

I can't review that (I'm not a browser peer).

We usually also change the property name when we change the value. But in this case, I'm not sure if it's really needed.

I also just noticed that Debugger has no access key...
Right now, pressing 'd' works as 'd' is free and Debugger starts with 'd'.
Do you want it as this bug's scope ?

This works because it happens that no other menu item has occupied D. We should explicitly reserve D for Debugger such that it will also be underlined.

No, this would be a separate bug.
ok filed bug 790227 for that.
