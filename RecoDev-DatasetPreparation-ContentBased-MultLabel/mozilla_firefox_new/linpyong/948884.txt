With the current plan to harden the security of Firefox, we want to disallow internal privileged pages to use inline JavaScript. Since their amount is fairly limited, we start this by rewriting them bit by bit.

The inline scripts for toolkit/content/aboutTelemetry.xhtml was already moved into 
toolkit/content/aboutTelemetry.js .
inline scripts and styles are moved into toolkit/content/aboutTelemetry.js and toolkit/content/aboutTelemetry.css. Not a bug anymore.
Can I have this bug assigned me?
Thanks for the updates, Georgiana and Malintha.
I think this should still be patched to replace the `a` tags that contain an href pointing to "javascript:". The href should be "#" instead.
Hi, I am interested in working on this bug. So can you please assign this to me?

Sorry, Jake. Looks like lpy had a patch ready and was a tad faster :) You can take a look at bug 923920, its dependencies are all similar to this one. Just look for one without an assignee and comment there as you did here. Thanks!

Looks good.
Flagging for additional review from a toolkit module peer.

I, uh, don't know HTML that well. I /think/ this is OK and am giving it a rubber stamp because if it works, I can't imagine this is wrong. But I thought href was optional on <a>?

Might want to run this by someone who knows HTML.
