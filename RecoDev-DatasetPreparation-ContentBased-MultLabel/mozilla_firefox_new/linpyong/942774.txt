Currently, when loading a file into Scratchpad, the file is immediately marked as â€œnot savedâ€ (visible by the star prepended to the file name in the title). Thus, when closing Scratchpad without actually changing the file, I still get a prompt to save it.

This is obviously not necessary for files that were just loaded but never changed.

The behavior is triggered by `self.setText(content);` in the `SP_importFromFile` function [1]. Setting the text will raise the `textChanged` event which in turn will put the Scratchpad editor in an unsaved state.

It seems that the `textChanged` event is only being listened to when the file was saved until the first change. I would suggest solving this similarly to how itâ€™s done in the initialization by calling `onTextSaved` after the text has been loaded from the file [3]. In addition this would require removing the listener first before starting to load the file.

Agreed.
Confirmed on 28.0a1 (2013-12-09), Win 7 x64.
I would like to work on the bug. Can I be assigned to it?
sure, Bhagya. Attach a patch and we'll set the assignee to you. Thanks!
Can you please assign this bug to me? I am interested in working on this bug.

The code link in description are out of date.
Is that really all thatâ€™s necessary now to fix this? Wow, a lot seems to have happened in that file :o
The |set dirty| will call |setClean| in the editor and update the title. I think that can solve this problem. Any suggestion appreciated.

This looks like the correct fix, but I'd also like to see a test added to confirms this behavior so it won't break in the future again. You should be able to add a check somewhere around [1] to confirm that gScratchpad.dirty is false.
