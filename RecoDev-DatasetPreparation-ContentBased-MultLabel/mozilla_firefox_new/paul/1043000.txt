If I:

1. Open WebAPI
2. Select device connected over adb (listed because adb access is enabled)
3. See notification telling me connection failed (because no devtools)
4. Enable devtools access on device
5. Select device again to connect

Connection is successful, and 'Open App' menu is populated, but notification saying the connection failed is still shown.

It should go away if I successfully connect to the device.
