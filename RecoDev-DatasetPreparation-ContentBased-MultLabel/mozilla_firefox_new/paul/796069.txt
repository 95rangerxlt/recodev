We leave a gap after the attribute list and right before the closing bracket of the opening tag of a node so that you can add attributes more easily, like so:

<li class="item"  ></li>

This ends up being distracting, as it looks visually off.

We should make it look better or find another way to allow easy editing.

We don't have to make it that easy. We can already add an attribute by editing the last attribute. I think it's good enough (and afaik, it's what Chrome does).

Let's remove this extra space.
Doesn't work if there's no attribute though...

Heather, what do you think of this approach?

The extra space is still present, but it overlaps the closing bracket. To add extra attributes, the user can click the closing bracket
