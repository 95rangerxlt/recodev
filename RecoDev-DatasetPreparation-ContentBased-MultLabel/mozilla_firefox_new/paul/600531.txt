would take this in b7 if you can get it done on time. would really like to, in fact.
It seems to only happen the first time you select a tab. If you switch to a different tab and then back, it works fine.

Patch v0.1

We were still getting caught by the session history listener since it wasn't always getting deleted. It was also never being properly removed.
Note: It works again if i open Panorama and then escape to Firefox. :S

that's not a good work-around for those that don't/won't ever use Panorama.  I was told early on that if you don't use Panorama that it should have no impact on the browser until its opened and the iFrame is lives in is loaded.  I still have doubts about that, and suspect that any tab(s) you have open are lurking in the Panorama background causing undue memory use/issues like this.

Patch v0.1

will _resetTabRestoringState also delete aBrowser.__SS_restoring?

r=me if that's covered.
also, you should be able to write a test for this, yes?

Yes.

(In reply to comment #7)
> also, you should be able to write a test for this, yes?

Yes. I have one locally. It tests that BrowserReloadOrDuplicate on each tab works. This is the method called by reload in the menu, keyboard shortcut, or toolbar button.

I'm thinking this should probably go into beta7 while we still have the chance.

Patch v1.0 (for checkin)

Added the test.
Pushed http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/edf05b298094
Testing with latest hourly with this patch, it appears that this is not fully fixed.  It still takes two (2) presses of any refresh combo: Ctrl+r, Ctrl+f5 or F5 before the tab will reload.

It seems you're quite correct. It was working for me when I tested and the tests follow exactly what ctrl-r does. I'll look into it nowish.

Drivers-people: should we keep this closed and just open a followup? We're in a much better state as far as reloading goes, but not completely out of the whole (at least it works eventually without any silly switch to panorama hacks). I'll leave reopened for now and just treat the followup work as a b7 blocker unless somebody says otherwise.
New bug, unless the patch needs backing out (doesn't sound like it does).
Nope, doesn't need to be backed out.
