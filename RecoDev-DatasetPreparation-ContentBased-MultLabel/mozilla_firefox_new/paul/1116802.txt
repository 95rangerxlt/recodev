while testing some fixes locally on a mochitest-chrome test, I noticed that there was a random window sitting around.  Doing some basic sleuthing, I found this to be in the webide directory, and a few test runs yielded test_zoom.html as the culprit:
http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/test/test_zoom.html

it appears we:
* launch the webide
* zoom, etc.
* close the webide
* launch the webide
* zoom, etc.
* finish

^ notice, we don't appear to have code that closes the webide on the second time.

Thanks Joel, this is a great simple example for me to try out. I will attach my patch in a little bit (am running tests locally just to make sure I am following the correct process).

I am still not sure how to tell what might have been originally calling this or making it fail (It didn't fail when I ran the test)  But maybe that depends on running the full set of tests, or on a particular platform or something. It makes sense that this would probably fix whatever it was, though.

Here you go. I ran the mochitest-chrome tests on browser/devtools/webide/test/ . Nothing failed and no spare WebIDE windows lingered.

This is great!  I would be comfortable r+'ing the patch, but in this case lets ask the original test author to review it.  Just in case there is some odd reason why it was written that way.

browser/devtools/webide/test/test_zoom.html leaves a webide window open after it is completed
