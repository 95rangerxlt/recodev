Patch v0.1

There are a number of tests that have non-unix line endings. Invisible, but I encountered them patching a test today and it bothered me.

Dietrich, I have some other cleanup things laying around here (stripping out trailing whitespace, fixing some tests for consistency, etc.). Do these fall under the category of things that should be reviewed or can I just land them? (it might make blame a bit harder, but meh...)
