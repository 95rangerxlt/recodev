We need to disable the floating scrollbars because of bug 799471.

I also think these are the reason why we ran into race conditions in bug 798775 bug 798772 and bug 797335. This patch re-introduce the 2 tests and disable the floating scrollbars.

Looks fine. I assume you will be adding the toggle (checkbox, pref, or whatever) in bug 799471?
