Node selection in dark theme proposed change

Made the highlight color slightly lighter. However, in my opinion, it does not seem like the current color needs a change. Please advise.

Node selection in light theme proposed change

Made the highlight color slightly darker. Again, it doesn't seem like the current color needs a change. It is perfectly visible on my monitor.
These don't appear to be that different from what we have currently. I wonder if adding some color to the selection could help rather than a different level of gray?

You could try using the system-defined Highlight color for the selection's background color.

e.g., 

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#2913

That should work for the light theme, at least.

This doesn't look very different to my eyes. Same contrast.

still similar. See comment 11.

Increase Selection Contrast Ideas - i01

A few ideas here:

1) Keep roughly what we have but add a border to make it stand out more
2) Invert the text and use a more solid background
3) Use a different more obvious color

Approach 1 lets you keep syntax highlighting but 2 or 3 are more contrasty and obvious.
Voting for 1).
Leon, still working on this?
I'll pick this one up!
I adjusted the color a bit and provided a nice rounded border to the selection border for the dark theme. Was looking to have someone check this one out for review and possible submission but I updated my nightly source and looks like some of the dev tools have been disabled. It looks like this is typical from what I have read about the development process. Am I right?
Hi,

I would like to try this out as a first timer.

I made changes to the file marked by Paul Rouget (in the linux directory instead of osx since i'm using linux), but the change did not get reflected. Am I supposed to re-compile firefox for the changes to take effect?

No tools were recently disabled. Can you describe the problem you are facing in more detail? Do you see any errors in the Browser Console?

You shouldn't, as symlinks are used by default on Linux. Try adding the "-purgecaches" option to your firefox binary execution, and if that doesn't work, do a "./mach build" to make sure your changes are actually working.
Sure, I can. Whenever launching nightly with ./mach run the app loads fine but it appears that very few of the dev tools are working now that I have tested it thoroughly. My standard firefox collection of dev tools consists of Web Console, Debugger, Inspector, Style Editor and Profiler. These aren't appearing in my Nightly build at all. The Browser console unfortunately fails to load as well.
See if setting devtools.debugger.log = true (and restarting) shows any useful error messages in your terminal.
It was set to false. I set to true and restarted Nightly but no erros were logged in the terminal.

Use: `./mach run -jsconsole` to see potential errors.
Thanks Paul. It does look like I have a few errors. One that stands out is |10n error with open.commandkey referencing devtools/main.js.
@Blake: attach your patch here. But I think it's a problem with your build. Make sure to pull and build the current tree.

Patch v1

Using shorlander's colors. I didn't add the borders because the line can wrap, and then we see a double border in the middle of the line.
