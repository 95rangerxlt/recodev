This patch correctly includes the noise (missing from jar.mn), implement the flat toolbar, and implement the correct design for the sidebar.

Not tested on Windows yet.

Looks awesome with an added advantage of having style upgrade for 2 of my add-ons automatically for free :P

Although the sidebar's selected tab is missing some style ...

That's bad :( That means I'm missing something in my padding computation.
I don't have this problem on my Mac.

It's in splitview.css. I don't want to touch this yet.
