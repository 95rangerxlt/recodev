During a few browser chrome mochitests, we get messages like the following in the log:

TEST-INFO | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser/browser_588426.js | Console message: [JavaScript Error: "aTabs[0].linkedBrowser is null" {file: "resource:///components/nsSessionStore.js" line: 2982}]

(This is currently not reported as a test failure, although some local patches I have cause it to be.)

I see what the problem is there... Fallout from changing the way we store some data. In this case __SS_tabStillLoading is now on the tab's browser instead of put into tabData so we're checking a less safe place (which in this case doesn't exist).

I think I got that logic right...
Confirmed in https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=f031662ebeb9 that this avoids the JS error.

can you bust this out into a isFullyRestored (or whatever it makes sense to call it) helper? that would be far more explicit and readable. r=me with that change.
