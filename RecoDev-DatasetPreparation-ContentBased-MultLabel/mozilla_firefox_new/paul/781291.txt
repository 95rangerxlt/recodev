Apparently, 5px is too much. I'll add some screenshot to show the problem.

As you can see in the screenshots, this moves the command line to the left.

The webconsole icon has a margin-right of 2px. Maybe that's enough.
See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/gnomestripe/global/toolbarbutton.css#26

The idea is to perfectly replace the icon.

After this patch has been on m-c for a couple days, I think we should put in a request for Aurora uplift since this is a new feature in 17 and it's a simple, low-risk change.
