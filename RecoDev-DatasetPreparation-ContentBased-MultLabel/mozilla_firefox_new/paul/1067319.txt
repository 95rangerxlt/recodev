Ryan, any idea why we were checking deviceFront/preferenceFront?

Well, it used to check for |deviceFront|, but that did not seem to be used at all... 

I changed it to |preferenceFront|, since that is used to try to set the pref.

But, the use of it is in a try block, so it's not required to test for it up here.

With my Keon, I can't enable certified app debugging
