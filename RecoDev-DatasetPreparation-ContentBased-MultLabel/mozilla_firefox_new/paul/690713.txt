Methods like getParentObject are now isolated in TreePanel.jsm, but will be needed for the breadcrumbs display. We should extract them and move them to a new module (Utils.jsm).

patch v1

I was at first not sure we needed a constructor and prototype-based object for this, since I didn't think there was going to be any state stored in the object. But then I saw the treeWalker references.

I'm worried about leaks. This should have a destructor that handles cleanup of the treeWalker and any other references contained in here. R+ with those.

Addressed rob's comment.

patch v1.1

let's give this a run through try. Should be fine.
Thoughts:

- this is firebug legacy code that shouldn't be ported so much into our codebase. The breadcrumbs code use of the code should be avoided and it's a corner case need, anyway.

- the JSM is named "DOMUtils", there's nsIDOMWindowUtils as well, which causes some confusion.

- note that when we add JSMs, others will be able to reuse our code. This is not some valuable and reusable API we are providing to the Firefox codebase. This is just some niche code from Firebug, under-documented.

- doesn't this need SR? See http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/reviewers.html

I would suggest moving this code into the TreePanel.jsm, and add an EXPORT for the new symbol. This allows you to reuse the methods in the breadcrumbs code, and avoids the problem of adding a new JSM to the Firefox codebase.

Mihai brought this up yesterday and he's convinced me this is the right way to go. Leave it in TreePanel.jsm but export it.
ok
