When starting FireFox I get the following JavaScript error:

Error: this.windowToFocus.content is null
Source File: ///usr/home/matt/graze/browsers/firefox/components/nsSessionStore.js
Line: 1827

Looking at the source I see this:

    if (this.windowToFocus) {
      this.windowToFocus.content.focus(); /* THIS LINE */
    }

Starting in safe-mode makes this go away, but starting in normal mode with the SessionManager extension disabled doesn't it make it go away.

As far as I can tell this is having no effect on restoring my sessions when I start FireFox.

I can reproduce this at will with no extensions installed.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Set Firefox to restore windows and tabs from last time.
2. Have one browser window open and go to any web page.
3. Open another browser window with a blank tab (about:blank).
4. On the new window do a File->Exit.

When Firefox starts up the next time, the error will occur.
Could we just change that line to the following?

> if (this.windowToFocus && this.windowToFocus.content) {

Or put a try+catch to silently ignore that error? I'm not sure which has more overhead. In this case there's nothing to do about not having any content to focus, so we should just keep moving along.

Simon?

Patch v0.1

I've been seeing this a lot because I'm restoring a session with a focused blank tab, so I wrote the patch. The error's gone. Do we need a test here?

This isn't automatically testable, since a restart is required for reproducing. Not sure whether a Litmus test is needed, though.

Session Data which generates the exception when restored

A restart isn't necessary to test this.  Simply manually construct the session data like is done for any other SessionStore test.  Then restore it using the setBrowserState API function.

The attached session data will generate the exception when passed as a parameter to setBrowserState.
(In reply to comment #5)
True that a restart isn't needed to make this happen. But it's not possible to catch the error since the call to restoreDimensions is happening in a setTimeout. So the error doesn't propagate up in any sane way, even though we see it in the error console.

We could possibly get all errors bubbling up through Firefox & make sure none of them are specifically this one, but it hardly seems worth the effort.

approval1.9.2? to have one less error in the console.
I'm not sure I understand this bug. content usually isn't null for about:blank, is it?

It is ;-)

What's actually happening here is that we're opening a bunch of windows asynchronously, and we don't want windows that open after the window to focus to steal focus from the window to focus. Unfortunately the code is also used for windows that open before the window to focus, and the window to focus hasn't loaded its chrome yet and therefore has no content.
