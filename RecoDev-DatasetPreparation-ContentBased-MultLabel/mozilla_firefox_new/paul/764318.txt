Dao, I am also interested to know if this is the best way to be notified if a tab has been selected / hidden.

Normally you'd use a TabSelect listener on gBrowser.tabContainer.

Thanks.
When does this event listener get removed?

Actually, this won't work because we uncheck the buttons if another tab is selected.
But we don't know if the next tab is not in the responsive mode.

Uncheck only if the new selected tab is not in responsive mode

Please file a bug on renaming tab.responsiveUI to tab.__responsiveUI, since it's no property managed by tabbrowser.xml but entirely external.
