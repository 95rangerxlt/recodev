We need a dropdown menu with the tools that are not present in the toolbar.
Early mockups of the toolbar had a star (or some icon like that), which I believe was also the idea for Firefox's own "20%" features (limi's term for the stuff used 20% of the time/or by 20% of the users).

I'm curious what presentation you have in mind now. I'm thinking it's probably not literally a "DevTools" menu as listed in the summary of this bug.
I haven't done anything yet for this bug, and I need to think about the UI.

I was thinking about a menu like the Bookmark menu.

My plan is to use the same button that we use to list the scripts in the debugger, but instead of text, I'll use a "tool" icon.

This is the simplest way to get all the tools in the devtb at the moment. But I am open to any suggestion.

Sounds good. Simple to start works for me!

I'd prefer a more meaningful id such as "developer-toolbar-other-tools".

ditto

This clones menuWebDeveloperPopup's children including their id, so we end up with duplicate ids in the document.
Would it make more sense to just reparent the menu on popup, and then put it back after it closes?

But then you'll see the elements that are hidden in the toolbar.

We could just remove the id. Maybe while cloning, or better, directly from original menuitems.
Or we could just put the wanted menu items directly in the markup.

ok
We are reproducing the same code (menu popup) in 3 different places (appmenu, menubar, devtb menu) and maybe 4 (bug 754481).

We can't use the same popups (because the content is not exactly the same), so I think we should code via some broadcasters.

Dao, if you think you can't review this patch in time for the Aurora merge, I can write a simpler patch without this XUL refactoring.

"More Tools"

Please rename all broadcaster:Tools:Foo instances to devtoolsMenuBroadcaster_Foo.

More Tools: checkmarks are not treated equally

The checkmarks of the More Tools menu are not treated equally.
Only Developer Toolbar, Responsive Design View and Style Editor get a checkmark, the others not. Those with checkmark can also close the corresponding window/dialog, but the others not.

It would be much nicer if all these windows can be opened and closed in the same way.

Could you file a bug for that?
