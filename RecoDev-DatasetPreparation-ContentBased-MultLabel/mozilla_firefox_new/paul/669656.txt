When the user locks a node, the highlighter should give a visual feedback. A different style (colors?) for the selection box could be a good approach.

The approach here is to make the selection box borders half transparent while inspecting, and totally opaque while locked. The difference is not big, but it should be enough.

Also, I removed the stopInspecting call in closeInspectorUI, because it would call onlock, which is useless. We called stopInspecting because it was removing some listeners. So I removed stopInspecting and add instead detachPageListeners().

patch v1

Naming nit:

Not sure I like the onlock and onunlock method names. They suggest that they're callbacks but they're being called directly. Maybe rename them locked and unlocked?

Further, since you're just adding and removing classList entries in onlock/unlock, maybe just do that directly instead of calling a full method?

I decoded the CSS and think it looks reasonable. In my local version though, I have outline: 2px and offset: -2px. I think that would look better and be slightly more visible than a 1px half-transparent border.

r+ with the methods removed.
ps, do the unittests still pass with the stopInspecting call removed?

Addressed Rob's comments.

I think the selection border should be 1px, not 2px. I just feel like 2px is too "rough". We are delimiting a surface here, and 1px is what all the designer tools do.

We should add the same kind of feedback in the HTML panel as well. Working on it.

Change the style of the dashed  border in the highlighter and change the color of the selection in the HTML Inspector.

Classes should be reusable and distinctive in mozilla code (i.e. using .locked with no id put in front would need to make sense throughout -- at least -- browser.xul). Here you should set an attribute rather than a class since you only want to put this particular element in a certain mode.

Also, why is this highlighterContainer rather than veilTransparentBox?

Will do.

In the future, some other elements in the controls box could be affected too (we are working on a floating info bar lying in the controls box, and its style will be affected too).

patch v1.5

Use a "locked" attribute instead of a class.
I removed the HTML panel related code (will do that in another bug).
Is there a downside to setting the attribute directly on highlighter-veil-transparentbox?
Not really. But we will have to move it back to highlighterContainer later (which is not a problem).
I'm asking because the descendent selector should be avoided. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS#Avoid_the_descendant_selector

"rgba(0,0,0,1)" should just be "black".
"outline: 1px dashed rgba(255,255,255,1)" should just be "outline-color: white".

r=me with that

By the way, please use 8 lines context in patches.
