Some people during Dev. Edition trials attempted to install an app to:

* Local Runtime
* Chrome Desktop

This does not work because they don't support apps today, but we still let you try, which confusing.

Paul, maybe you want to look at this?
I was thinking we could disable based on whether the webapps actor exists.
Yes. And we can add a warning/error to details.xhtml to say that the app can not be installed on this runtime.

I don't have any iOS device at the moment to test this patch.

Works as intended for Chrome and iOS. (P.S. if you have a Mac but no iOS device, you can also connect to the iOS Simulator.)

For the Local Runtime, the play button is still enabled, but then fails with "Not B2G. Can't launch app.".  What's a good way to do better here?  We could use a trait on Firefox desktop like "webappsLaunch: false", or something.  Does that seem like that a good idea?  Anyway, probably best in a followup.

Yes. I saw that (that's why I had to change how errors are displayed).

Because we can't do much with the apps actor on Firefox desktop, we should not register this actor for the browser.
