I have a patch here that just add a "View Console" option in the menu and then dumps the logs in a Firefox tab. Feels better.
I decided to just remove the console and use a notification mechanism.

Patch doesn't apply, your dependencies are messy. Why is this patch the 9th in your patch queue (according to bug 1012760), when it is marked as blocking your 4th patch?

Please create a proper patch queue so that we can review patches in a sane order.

patch v2

- killing many calls to console.* (many are not useful or eventually the information will reach the UI)
- introducing a notification mechanism for errors
- drop the logs box
- while testing potential failure, I found problems when we delete the directory of the project. I added a check for that (forceDetailsOnly)

I guess this should never happen, since the `play` button is disabled when there are validation errors.

How did you decide which errors to report with `console.error` (e.g. here) versus `this.reportError` (e.g. below) versus both (e.g. listRunningApps)? I'm asking because for several `console.error` calls I'm wondering why `reportError` is not called.

reportError are things that could result from a user action. You're right about the play button thing, but later we will introduce command line options that could trigger the play command.

The choice of using reportError or console.error looks arbitrary,
but that's something we can tune by using it.

Like here. we show an error to the user if something went wrong with the request, but not when there is something wrong with the database.
