Joe wants us to extract some of the nested functions up a level.

  exec: function(args, context) {
    function foo() {
    }

    foo();
  }

Can be re-written:

  exec: function(args, context) {
    this.foo();
  },
  foo: function() {
  }
We should also back-fill some unit tests.
I've added some which I'll send you.

Patch v1

I have moved functions back a level where they are not shared. I have also sorted the addon autocomplete list.

Patch v1

Review of attachment 641453:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Looks good. I think we could also add tests that do:

>> addon list
  // check for the default addon

>> addon list theme
  // not there
  // perhaps repeat this for all the addon types. It's easy cut and paste code anyway

>> addon disable Default

>> addon list
  // Can we easily check it's disabled?

>> addon enable Default
  // Can we easily check it's enabled?

v2

The tests fail because outputMatch cannot be checked when a command is async. Joe said that I should write tests that should work and he will fix the testing framework.
Created separate bug for async test issues (bug 773313)
For some strange reason I can't r+ v2. However consider it r+ed.
This is in need of an un-bitrot, and maybe we could convert to helpers.check while we're at it.
New component triage. Filter on "Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce"
Most of this has already been tidied / fixed as parts of other bugs.

The tests can now check results though so I will add that.
