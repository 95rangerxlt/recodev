Test Log.test

When browser_markupview_events.js runs something makes GC kick in and clean up windows and docshells *for around 40 seconds*. This causes tasks, and eventually the test, to time out.

Because this is an issue with the testing infrastructure rather than the feature itself we will land the test disabled and fix the GC issue as part of this bug.

The relevant section of the test log along with a screenshot of the issue are attached.

This will mean going to the end of each test that creates the windows in this log and forcing GC there. It may also mean calling destroy methods at the end of those tests.

We should probably make a habit of forcing GC in tests that open a lot of windows.
These windows are GCd in the 40+ seconds pause.

Wouldn't requesting a longer timeout be a good interim solution?

Any test that opens a few panels can trigger this so we need something more permanent.

I am going to try calling garbageCollect() on toolbox destroy... it should leave us in a much better state.

To fix the GC issues we:
- Garbage collect on toolbox close. This should help with all tests that open the toolbox.
- Manually destroy the tooltip. Allowing the browser to do it can result in intermittent leaks on Linux boxes.

Other issues fixed:
- Return early when the debug icon is clicked to avoid errors concerning this._tooltip.

I'm not keen on us adding explicit GC to live code just so we can pass tests. That feels like it's making things worse for the user.

Also I don't think we should be adding events for destroy actions. Can't we use a promise?

I have added the conditional if (gDevTools.testing) {...} so that there is no action when a user closes the toolbox but we still avoid building a large GC backlog in tests.

We don't even need to do that. As long as tooltip.hide() is called the test runs just fine.

Does this still need to be here?

Wouldn't event.stopPropagation() be clearer?

I left it there because in the event of a timeout we want to see as much of the log as possible and not just the last few lines. We discussed this in a daily meeting and the consensus was that this should probably be default for our tests.
