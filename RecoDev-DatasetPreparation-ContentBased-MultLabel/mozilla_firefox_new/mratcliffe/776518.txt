Some of toolkit's XPCShell tests now require toolkit/devtools/sourcemap/tests/unit/Utils.jsm, and Utils.jsm in turn requires Require.jsm.

Unfortunately, Require.jsm is only available to browser, since it's under browser/devtools/shared.

This means that comm-central's XPCShell tests are busted (since we run toolkits XPCShell tests along with our own), and our tree is very orange.

Can we move Require.jsm and dependencies somewhere into toolkit?

Patch

Moved to Require.jsm to toolkit as requested
http://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=af8f536b5b46

This will work as long as we are not debugging dependencies. We could also move Console.jsm but that would be robcee's call.

Why?

you should change importers of Require.jsm to resource://gre/modules/Require.jsm and update the jar file accordingly.

disregard that. Dave helped me understand that we're blowing up your tests.
Can we just put the module directly under toolkit/devtools, rather than in its own directory? Flatter directory structures are better!

No jar involved but done.

Patch II - the sequel

I'm gonna r+ to get Tbird back up and running, but I think we should probably have gre/modules/devtools as the path. I will update and land.
