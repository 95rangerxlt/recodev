We have moved Require.jsm into toolkit but failed to move Console.jsm with it.

Some of toolkit's XPCShell tests now require toolkit/devtools/sourcemap/tests/unit/Utils.jsm, and Utils.jsm in turn requires Require.jsm which in turn requires Console.jsm

Unfortunately, Console.jsm is only available to browser, since it's under browser/devtools/shared.

This means that comm-central's XPCShell tests are busted (since they run toolkit's XPCShell tests along with their own), and their tree is a shocking shade of orange.

Console.jsm needs to be moved into toolkit?

Moved Console.jsm to toolkit.

Also changed Console.jsm and Require.jsm paths to resource://gre/modules/devtools/*.jsm as requested by robcee in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=776518#c8

This stuff should really be using bug 773933's JS_MODULES_PATH. I guess you probably don't want to block on that, so we can clean this up after the fact.

I didn't realize that it hadn't landed yet. Asking robcee for review again.
If it helps speed up the review process, I can tell you that with this patch, the failing tests go green again.

I hope joe doesn't hate me for this...
Please could we create a followup bug that makes us tidy up the implementation a bit.
Before this move it was kind of private
