During browser_cmd_addon.js I get the following failure:
html output for addon disable Test_Plug-in_1.0.0.0 - Got Test Plug-in 1.0.0.0 is already disabled., expected Test Plug-in 1.0.0.0 disabled

Interestingly, if I check just before receiving this message then the plugin is still enabled. If I then try to disable it via GCLI I am told that it is already disabled.

I haven't seen this on try and tests do run very quickly on my setup so maybe this is the cause.

It seems that on my laptop the Test Plugin is marked as click to activate. This means that it is half disabled.

This simple patch checks for addon.userDisabled === AddonManager.STATE_ASK_TO_ACTIVATE and acts appropriately.
