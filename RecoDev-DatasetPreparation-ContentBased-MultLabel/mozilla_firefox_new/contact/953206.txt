I think it would be useful to have a View menu in Scratchpad.

For example, it could

 -> Change zoom
 -> Change font family
 -> Enable/disable syntax highlighting
 -> Customize syntax highlighting
 -> Show/hide line numbers
 -> Enable/disable breaking long lines instead of horizontal scroll

"Change font family" and "Customize syntax highlighting" don't seem to fit well in the "View" menu item. This mockup is my proposal and both menu items weren't included.

Patch based in the mockup. It doesn't have any command. Keyboard shortcuts are missing from some items.

Thanks for the patch, Willian.

I'm not as familiar with the scratchpad trajectory these days and I think Rob would have more to say about this, so I'm changing review to him.

This is a good start for this menu, but we'll need the underlying commands to make these work.

Reword this to "Show Line Numbers". Making these menu items actions instead of things I think makes more sense.

maybe "Wrap Text" or "Soft Wrap"?
Re-reading the original reporter's comments, we might want to provide highlighting for different languages eventually. I'm fine with a toggle for JavaScript for a first version though.

Thanks!

"Show Line Numbers" command implemented. I think we need a good keyboard shortcut for this feature. Do you have any suggestion?
Thank you very much.
Keyboard shortcuts is an undocumented mess. I don't think we need to bother with it in this caseâ€”I doubt many people toggle line numbers that often.
Anton, I understand what you mean and I agree with you.
What do you think. Are there any menu item that needs keyboard shortcuts?
Thank you.
I wouldn't bother with any shortcuts in the View menu. If it happens that there is something that could really benefit from a shortcut, we can always add it later.
(Except for zoom, actually)
Hey, I just landed bug 910183. Could you add "highlight trailing space" as an option as well, please? There's a Firefox pref devtools.scratchpad.highlightTrailingSpace and Editor pref highglightTrailingSpace that you will need to work it.

Actually, cancel that review request, Anton.

There are a number of indentation changes in scratchpad.dtd. We can't include those because it cause trouble with our localization automation software.

Also makes it impossible to see what's actually changed.

thanks!

Do you really need these one-line methods? You can just do `Scratchpad.toggleEditorOption("lineNumbers")` in scratchpad.xul.

This (and _minimumTextSize) should be file-level constants. E.g. `const MAXIMUM_TEXT_SIZE = 96;` in the beginning of the file.

Nit: long, descriptive variable names are good but when your function is only four lines long they don't add much. `let size = this.editor.getFontSize();` would work as well as `currentTextSize`.

This should be a constant as well. Also, how did you get that number?

View menu implemented. "Highlight JavaScript" feature was removed.

bug-953206-view-menu-implemented-v7.patch

Review of attachment 8371920:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The code looks good but there are some problems with functionality:

1) You need to add check-boxes to the View menu items when their features are enables. For example, in this screenshot (http://cl.ly/image/2V3T3n1O431r) you can see that Highlight Trailing Space feature is enabled but there's not indication of that in the View menu.
2) Alt + and Alt - shortcuts didn't work for me on a Mac.
3) When resizing text it seems like we need to redraw CodeMirror somehow, otherwise cursor becomes all weird. I'll look into it.
Ok re 3) in your patch, could you make the setFontSize method look like this:

  /**
   * Sets font size for the editor area.
   */
  setFontSize: function (size) {
    let cm = editors.get(this);
    cm.getWrapperElement().style.fontSize = parseInt(size, 10) + "px";
    cm.refresh();
  },

This will solve no. 3

Alt + and Alt shortcuts does work for me on a Debian Linux. I don't have a Mac to test it. How should we proceed now, Anton?

Find someone who have a Mac. I can probably do that next week.
May you test it with your Mac, benvie? Thank you!
I'm one of those poor souls without a mac. Sorry!

Here it goes.
Thank you Gabriel L.
Hi Willian, I tested the patch on my mac and it is working great! I tested that each menu item in 'View' was working, and the shortkeys for Larger/Smaller/Normal Font Size was working as well. It looked like the shortkeys for Wrap Text and Highlight Trailing Spaces are still missing, but maybe this was intended?
Great!
Yes, shortkeys for Wrap Text and Highlight Trailing Spaces are missing. This was intended.
What's next?
Thank you very much Gabriel L
I would look to see if there are any related unit tests for the scratchpad ui, and ensure that it covers the View menu then send a review to Benvie once you think your patch is ready.

Good work!

But I think View menu should be moved after Edit menu, not before. Normally its placed this way.
Shouldn't View Menu be available on Aurora 31 ?
I don't believe Aurora 31 is out yet.
Oh sorry, I assumed it was Aurora 31 since Nightly 32 and Stable 29 were released.
