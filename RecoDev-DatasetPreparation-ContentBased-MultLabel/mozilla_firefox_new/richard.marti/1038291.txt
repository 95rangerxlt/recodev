Michael, I checked the German Nightly and saw they are using really long labels which makes it hard to follow your proposal. What do you think how can this styling be applied on locales with such long labels?

The only change I did on this screenshot was aligning the two first rows to show the issues better. The pane is on full width of 800px.
(In reply to Richard Marti (:Paenglab) from comment #1)

Let's make the buttons wrap to the next line instead of breaking the grid. For German, it can wrap like the following:

When Nightly starts: [Show my home page                    â†“]
          Home page: [Nightly start page                    ]
                     [Use current pages] [Use bookmark...]
                     [Restore to Default]

The above diagram shows that there may be blank space at the end of the first row of buttons. It would be even better if you can use flex-grow to get the "Use current pages" and "Use bookmark..." buttons to grow to consume the available space in the row so there is no gap of space.

Richard, is this enough for you to pick up this bug again?
Yes, I can try doing this.
Great, thanks!

This patch wraps the buttons but I have two problems:
- The third button when wrapped to the second line will use the full width. But I need the flex on all buttons to make them the same width when on one line. Is this okay or what can be done to look like you drawn in comment 2?
- When the box wraps, the content below doesn't shift down. What is needed to make the following content shifting down?

Can you try using an <html:table> instead of a <xul:grid> to see if that fixes the problem with the other content on the page not moving when the row wraps?

It looks like there isn't a way to have this last item have both flex-grow:1; as well as not grow if it is moved to its own line. I sent an email to www-style@w3 to make sure that I didn't miss anything in the spec.

Let's stay with the item taking up the full width if it wraps. We need the wrapping due to some locales having long strings for their labels.

With <html:table> this works.
I've used inline styles where I think it's for the layout and the other styles in theme which should be themeable.

I haven't added the spacing between the radio lines in "Downloads" and "Tabs" as attachment 8439538 proposes because I think this makes the page to tall and scrolling is needed too much. If still desired I could add a separator with class=thin which has a height of 0.5em.

This doesn't look RTL friendly. You'll want text-align:end;

Also, what "gaps" is this referring to? border-spacing:0; should have removed the space between cells that you may have been seeing.

Would a "chrome://browser/*content*/preferences/in-content/preferences.css" be okay for this rules or should they go to the normal stylesheet?

Without the width: 1%; the first column would flexing and be wider than the widest text.

I got confirmation from Tab that this is not possible with current flexbox but it is a high priority item for flexbox-2, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0150.html

Is this better?
I talked with Gijs about this patch and he noticed that the spec doesn't include the Default Browser checkbox. We weren't sure if the presence of the checkbox was taken in to account with the grid layout of the Startup section.

Michael, do you still want the Default Browser checkbox to be the first thing in the Startup section?

I would suggest the we left-align the form elements within the "Startup" grouping. If we could edge-case this locale that would be ideal from a design standpoint, but I can understand the complexity that requires on your end of the code, so it's not required.

Yes, let's leave that in as the first item within the "Startup" grouping.

Please add a class to each of these buttons and then use the className here instead of the universal selector. Anytime a universal selector (*) is used as the right-most selector we will have very bad performance as all elements on a page are first selected and then the selection is narrowed as the selector is parsed from right-to-left.

This should be in the stylesheet. You can use classes or IDs on the <tr> and <td> so you don't have to use nth-child.

This should be border-collapse: collapse;

border-spacing is only relevant when border-collapse: separated; is used, but we don't want `separated` here. border-collapse: collapse; gives us the desired look and also matches the desired table rendering model.

Use `width: 0;` here. I couldn't find an alternate solution, but width:0; works the same as width:1% for me.

The .wrap-content class isn't referenced within the XUL file.

CSS class names should not describe the behavior of the styles. In the future when the styles change, the name will become inconsistent. A better name would be .homepage-buttons
