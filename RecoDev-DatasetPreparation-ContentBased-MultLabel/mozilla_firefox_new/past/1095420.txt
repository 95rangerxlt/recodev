The migrateToDevEdition action is currently only performed when the user clicks on the aurora-specific "Start using Sync…" link in the preferences panel. It would be best to also do it when the SYnc button is highlighted from the UI Tour.

UI Tour should cause a migration to aurora when highlighting Sync

This is what I think is required. I'm testing it now.

UI Tour should cause a migration to aurora when highlighting Sync v2

Discussing this on IRC, Mark suggested that taking the migration path shoudl be the default behavior, as it will end up in the normal singup/signin flow if the pref is not set anyway.

After more discussion Mark suggested that we simplify further and always check the migration pref in about:accounts. This ensures a migration will be attempted both from the link in the preferences panel as well as from the hamburger menu button. The test still passes.

I think you should have a trailing .then(null, err => {Cu.reportError(...); return false;}) here
