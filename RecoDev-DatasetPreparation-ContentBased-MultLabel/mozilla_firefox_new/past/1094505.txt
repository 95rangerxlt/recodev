See screenshot, it would be great if the installer displayed 'Firefox Developer Edition' instead of 'FirefoxDeveloperEdition'.

You probably meant this to block fx-dev-edition

Avoid using concatenated name in installer

I think this should work, assuming branding.nsi overrides defines.nsi.in. I want to push it on Gum to verify, but we decided to no longer treat Gum as our try server, so asking for review first.

Avoid using concatenated name in installer v2

Turns out you can't define something twice. Who knew?

Avoid using concatenated name in installer v2

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Developer Edition feature, but the concatenated strings were introduced in bug 1072181 and bug 1090324
[User impact if declined]: users will see an ugly browser name in some parts of the Windows installer
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: manual testing on try
[Risks and why]: practically zero risk, as it's just a string change
[String/UUID change made/needed]: a string was changed to a value that is already present, but it's not even one that is localized as far as I know
