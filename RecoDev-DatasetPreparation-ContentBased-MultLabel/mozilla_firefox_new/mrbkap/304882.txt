bookmarklet as textfile
I'm guessing this is jst's.
The trunk nightly has this regression as well.
A simpler bookmarklet that fails now on the branch but didn't fail with this
morning's branch nightly:

javascript:document.write(); alert(location.href);

the patch + extra changes

This is fallout from my checkin to the branch earlier today (bug 303267). This
patch switches us to actually doing security checks for accesses to the
location object instead of doing the null-out-docshell dance.

This patch conflicts with my patch for bug 304764, so I'll attach a new one
when I can extract the relevant changes.

Note to self: Parent it to the *outer* window

real patch

This patch should apply directly on top of the patch for bug 304764 (i.e.,
apply that one first, then apply this one).

Looks good. Make the changes we talked about (nulling out the docshell in the
window state holders' dtor and asserting in PreCreate() if we don't have a
docshell) and I'll r=...

null out the docshell when the docshell goes away

This has the extra listener manager changes in it, but I promise those aren't
part of this bug :-).

Checked into trunk.

This fixes window.location to work closer to the way it did before the
splitwinodw landing.
I had to back this out because it was turning Txul tests orange.
Fix checked into the trunk, though the tree went red before any of the
tinderboxen that went orange the last time had a chance to go green. I'm marking
this FIXED, optimistically. I'll check in on the branch tomorrow.
And checked into MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH. Hopefully it'll have more luck there!

This probably caused bug 338288


bookmarklet fails (accessing location.href after document.write())
