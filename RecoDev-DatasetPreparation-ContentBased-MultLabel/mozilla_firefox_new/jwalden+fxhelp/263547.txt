couldn't find an existing bug for this, but dup/reassign as needed.

there are a few things in the Help's start page (when you first open Help > Help
Contents from the main menu) which need to be updated/corrected:

a. the "Troubleshooting" link points to an old Mozilla (v1.5) link at
http://www.mozilla.org/start/1.5/troubleshooting/ --not sure what the
appropriate link should be (unless this ought to be removed?)

b. the "Firefox Help" link needs to be updated from
http://texturizer.net/firefox/ to http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/support/

c. the "Realtime Chat" section doesn't provide any actual info as to how/where
to get connected to the Mozilla community via irc. the link for "User
Newsgroups" link, however, does load a page
(http://www.mozilla.org/community/user-forums.html) --the bottom of which does
include the appropriate info.

I'm deleing Troubleshooting and Realtime Chat; the forums are a much better
resource for these problems.  The link will be corrected, too.

I'm debating removing the User Feedback section.  For most users it's
irrelevant, and the Talkback dialog should explain things well enough.  Thoughts
on this?
Troubleshooting is now gone, as is Realtime Chat.  MozillaPL is also gone,
because there's no reason for a primarily-Polish site to be in English Help. 
I've left in User Feedback.  If there are no objections I'll probably remove it
sometime just before the Help freeze (so as to give those with concerns the time
to voice an opinion).
You should file a bug for Seamonkey Help on this issue.
User Feedback is removed as I've heard no objections.  This bug is now fixed
branch and trunk.
