This is by design. Ctrl+F4 is a windows-standard for closing tabs (and it is is
not the primary keyboard shortcut anyway)

Use Command+W.
Needs to be updated in Help documentation.  I am unable to reassign b ug to owner and QA contact of

summary/owner/qa changes as requested.
Cmd+F4 doesn't work because from what I can see, the shortcut is specifically
Ctrl+F4 (it works based on event.ctrlKey, not "accel" in @modifiers in XBL). 
Does the shortcut Ctrl+F4 work on the Mac?  Based on my reading of the following
source code, Ctrl+F4 should indeed work properly.

Until I can get this confirmed or not confirmed, I can't make the change without
having personally tested it (which won't happen as I don't have a Mac).

Well, control+f4 works _only_ if you disable the *default* OS keyboard shortcut
for "Focus on window (active) or next window" (that means it doesn't work for
most of the mac user base) so it should be removed from the help system.

Anyway, i'll open a separate bug for disabling Control+F4 on mac.
bug 264145
Shortcut removed for Macs.  I updated it to be ctrlKey specifically instead of
accelKey as well.  Fixed branch/trunk.

In the help only, right?


Remove Ctrl+F4 (Close Window) shortcut for Macs (it conflicts with a default OS setting)
