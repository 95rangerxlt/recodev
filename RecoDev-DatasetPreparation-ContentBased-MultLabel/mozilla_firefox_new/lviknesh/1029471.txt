How to reproduce:

Restore a session with 8700 tabs, where in one window, there are 2500 tabs. The "tree style tab" extension is active.

Expected result:

Restoring such an amount of tabs should take maybe 1 minute.

Actual result:

Restoring such an amount of tabs actually takes about 30 minutes.

Analysis:

One culprit for the performance degradation seems to be the implementation of ssi_getTabForBrowser() (see https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/annotate/f29ab60028d4/browser/components/sessionstore/src/SessionStore.jsm#l2968 ). That function is called in many different places, one being ssi_receiveMessage() which happens each time a tab is opened or closed. This effectively means that restoring tabs has Ω(n^2) performance, which in turn means that starting firefox has Ω(n^2) performance. If n=2500, that means a lot of CPU time and user's lifetime spent unneccessarily.

Ouch, I thought we had rewritten this method a long time ago. Thanks for noticing this.

This is a pretty simple bug that can be fixed with 5 to 10 lines of code plus documentation.

We need to create a WeakMap `_tabForBrowser`. In method `onTabAdd`, we should add the binding from `aTab.linkedBrowser` to `aTab` in `_tabForBrowser`. In method `getTabFromBrowser`, we should fetch the tab from `_tabForBrowser`.
tabbrowser._getTabForBrowser() is implemented the same. I think we should fix this and expose it rather than only fixing sessionstore.
Once bug 1039500 has landed, we can simply get rid of `_getTabForBrowser` in SessionStore.jsm and replace it with `window.gBrowser.getTabForBrowser`.
addtab() give DEPRECATION WARNING: _getTabForBrowser` is now deprecated, please use `getTabForBrowser

This looks great, thanks a lot Raphaël!
Can you push it to Try please?

Ran all sessionstore tests locally and they all pass. This is a very self-contained change that we don't need to push to try I think. But certainly good thinking!

Want to prepare it for checkin-needed? :)
