STR:
 1. Open a new tab with an enhanced sponsored tile. (I've got one for "Dashlane" in a new tab right now)

 2. Move your cursor to hover over the tile.

 3. Move your cursor to hover over the "sponsored" label.

EXPECTED RESULTS: The tile rendering shouldn't change between steps 2 and 3. (other than perhaps the "sponsored" label being highlighted)

ACTUAL RESULTS: The tile changes to its un-hovered render state, when I hover "sponsored".


This makes for jarring flashing when you mouse into the "sponsored" label from the bottom of the tab. Your cursor crosses a few px of tile, making the tile flash to its hovered state; but then when your cursor enters the "sponsored" label, the tile flashes back to its default state.

I get EXPECTED RESULTS for the "pin" & "x" buttons in the upper-left & upper-right of the tile. (When I hover those buttons, their rendering changes subtly, but the tile's rendering doesn't change.)

This is just an issue for the label at the bottom-right of the tile -- it's inconsistent with those other icons on the tile.

I believe this is from enclosing the title as part of the tile which also includes the SPONSORED/SUGGESTED tag from bug 1158853.

I think we should just treat the hovered tag as hovered with the rest of the tile.

kghim, is this jarring enough that we want to get into 39? See attachment 8610741

Mardak, can we consider the following? Either 1) expand the hover hit area for SPONSORED/SUGGESTED be enlarged to cover the entire right side of the label. The hit area would start from the label's left edge. See attachment. OR 2) remove hover functionality from title bar.

Enhanced tiles change to their non-hover rendering when you hover the "sponsored" label (and flash between renderings if you mouse across "sponsored")
