The non-remote browser binding has a .docShellIsActive property that silently fails when this.docShell is undefined. We should implement the same for the remote-browser binding to have background tabs de-prioritized.

Making remoteBrowser.docShellIsActive write-only makes it a little easier to implement. We would otherwise need to sync the active state with the tabParent whenever that changes. It is only ever written to in our current code, there are a few mochitests that read it but those can be rewritten in the future.

Olli should review this since I'm not a DOM peer.

uh, JS has some horrible looking syntax these days.
