When closing a tab we're freezing the tabItem size just as we do for "real" tabs on the tab strip to provide a better UX for mouse users. This effect is really unexpected if you write a test (or some piece of code) that uses gBroser.removeTab(). We should only freeze if the tabItem was closed by a mouse click (on the X or via a middle click).
