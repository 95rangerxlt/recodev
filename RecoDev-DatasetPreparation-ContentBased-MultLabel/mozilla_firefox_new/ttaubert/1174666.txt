If SessionStore.initializeWindow() were a little more intelligent we wouldn't need that function. Let's remove it and simplify the SessionSaver code.

This is something of a hack. I fully support it, but please mention that you're resetting the clock [to avoid writing immediately].

This isn't something new I'm adding, I'm just moving it. Will update the comment.

This was setting lastWriteTime=0, basically reverting the updateLastSaveTime() call from above. If we just move that to the proper branch we don't need it.
