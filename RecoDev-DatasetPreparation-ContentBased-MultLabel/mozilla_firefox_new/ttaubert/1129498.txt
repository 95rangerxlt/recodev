remove_all_bookmarks() in toolkit/components/places/tests/head_common.js has to be updated to use Bookmarks.jsm.

In most cases it's used just to cleanup roots, but that's done by eraseEverything.

In other cases though, like in test_leftpane_corruption_handling.js, it's really needed to remove also other roots (like the left pane folder), we can do that with the new API, by fetching children of the root that are not the main roots and removing them.

This is no more needed on trunk, you can completely remove run_test

let's create bm2 inside a folder, and remove that folder. the test outcome should be the same, basically only one bookmark out of 2 is removed.
So we don't need removeFolderChildren here
