If I scroll the foreground tab and then immediately quit, my scroll position won't be saved when I resume. That's because we don't invalidate the cache for scrolling, and the final data collection at shutdown uses the cached version.

I wonder if there's a notification or something that would tell us when the scroll position changes?

Should have been fixed by bug 921942. We listen for the scroll event now.


Tab state cache should be invalidated by scrolling
