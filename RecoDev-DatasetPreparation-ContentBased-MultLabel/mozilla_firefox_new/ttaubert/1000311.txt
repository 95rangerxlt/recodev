In bug 992911 we are working towards running the browser-chrome tests as single directories instead of larger chunks, this results in some failures.

you can see this error on try server (dt2):
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=3e06b3053bcc

and here is a link to a log file:
linux debug: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=38330979&tree=Try

this is for debug only.
