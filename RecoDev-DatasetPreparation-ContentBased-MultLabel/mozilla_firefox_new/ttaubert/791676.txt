The new tab page updater uses setTimeout(0) to start transitions for dynamically created elements:

After doing some testing and looking at bug 701626 it seems that this method doesn't work in 95% of all cases - which I somehow didn't notice when implementing it like this.

This comment doesn't really tell what's going on... It should say that style changes are being flushed in order to make the fade-in transition work.

Yes, that comment was poorly chosen, sorry.

"Use getComputedStyle() to" is redundant, just looking at the code you're commenting on makes this already clear.

>+      window.getComputedStyle(site.node).getPropertyValue("opacity");

window.getComputedStyle(site.node).opacity;
Thank you!
