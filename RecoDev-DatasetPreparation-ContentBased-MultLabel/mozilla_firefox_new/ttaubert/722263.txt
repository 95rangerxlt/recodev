Changing browser.newtab.url require restart.

In my opinion changing to browser.newtab.url need to be in effect immediately without restart.

This will be a major issue for add-ons that want to override the new tab page.

Adding a pref observer to update the value when changed.

patch v1

The observer needs to be removed when the window closes in order to not keep it alive.
Oops, right :/ How about using nsISupportsWeakReference for the observer instead of explicitly removing it?
I don't know, I think this may cause the observer to get lost when it shouldn't.

How exactly is this better than:

>+  function update() {
>+    BROWSER_NEW_TAB_URL = getNewTabPageURL();
>+  }
By defining a read-only getter we're not making anyone think BROWSER_NEW_TAB_URL is a setter that modifies the preference behind it. If you think we don't need to cover that case then of course just changing a property value is easier and has less overhead.
It won't be read-only at the time you're adding the observer. It would only be read-only once the pref changed once, which doesn't seem to make sense.
And yes, I don't think we need to worry about this and can just leave it writable.

Hmm, didn't know that defineLazyGetter() doesn't work that way.

Ok, will change that part.

patch v3

[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: browser.newtab.url pref requires restart, addon-compat with the new pref affected
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): no problems since its landing for fx13
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): backing out the new way to define the url used for new tabs which is imo a bigger risk
String changes made by this patch: none

This would solve the issues raised in bug 740340. We're providing the new preference to define the url used for new tabs but add-on authors can't use it right now because it requires a restart to take effect. This is of course nonsense for restartless add-ons and might also confuse users that manually change this pref.

patch v3

[Triage Comment]
This patch should be fairly low risk, and will prevent add-on compatibility fallout after FF12's release. Approved for Beta 12.

I believe this also affects Aurora 13, so approving for that branch as well.

This landed on mozilla-central in the Firefox 13 phase, which means that this is currently on aurora.
