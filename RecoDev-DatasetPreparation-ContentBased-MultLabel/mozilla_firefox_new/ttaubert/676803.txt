When a tab is added to an already stacked group that contains at least six tabItems then we'll never generate a thumbnail for this tab. If we now restart the browser, open panorama and expand the group every tabItem with indexInGroup > 5 has no thumbnail.

1) setBounds() is now also called for hidden tabItems when stack-arranging a group. This is essential for the thumbnails to have the right size.

2) Changed .tabHidden css from "display:none" to "visibility:hidden" so that a tabItem's canvas is actually rendered in the background and can be drawn to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

r=me. the only concern i have is that with big sessions we'll be rendering hundreds of canvases now that we weren't before, for the lifetime of the application. can you do a measurement of a large session to see if there's any detectable memory increase with this pach?
Fixed by bug 745303.
