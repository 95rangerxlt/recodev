When working on bug 951675 I forgot to remote the .updateField() and .removeField() calls that put broadcasted data into the TabStateCache. This fixes some intermittent failures that occur with the patch from bug 947212 where data remains in the tabState object although the PrivacyLevelFilter would have removed it.

Tim, is there something QA can do to verify this is fixed? Does this or should this have in-testsuite coverage?
No, there is nothing that QA can do to verify this. This was failing intermittently and I alas didn't manage to write a reliable test for this.
