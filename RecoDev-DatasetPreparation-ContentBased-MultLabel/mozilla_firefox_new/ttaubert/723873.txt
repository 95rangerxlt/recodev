Expected results:

Setting the browser to start with a blank page and setting the browser to start with a home page of about:blank both set the cursor in the address bar. It seems reasonable that a home page of about:newtab should do the same thing.

patch v1

Simple patch that uses isBlankPageURL() to set the value of isLoadingBlank.
Thank you!
