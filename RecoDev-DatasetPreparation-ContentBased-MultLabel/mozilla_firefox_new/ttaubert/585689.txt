Added a testcase using a nearestneighbor scaled Canvas to Bug #564978. Is there a TabCandy bug for the scaling implementation that I'm overlooking? Core doesn't seem to be the right place to discuss it, but that's what TabCandy-specific bugs were duped against in the past.

Hans, please create a new specific bug for that idea with the component tabcandy.
Done: Bug #597458
Changing to Tab Candy component.
Shouldn't this depend on bug #597043 ?
Note: the only things which we can land post-beta 11 (or whatever the last beta is) will blockers and test fixes (fixes to intermittent oranges, for example). Triaging accordingly.

Beta 10 meta bug: 608028
Beta 11 meta bug: 627096
I've just filed a bug that should be a hardblocker, IMO, if others are seeing the same thing as I do. It totally wrecks Panorama. It's bug 633849
We shipped! Hurray!
