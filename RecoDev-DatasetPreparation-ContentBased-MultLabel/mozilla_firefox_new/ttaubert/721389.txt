Build ID: 20120126031113

Steps to reproduce:

1/ Open a 1st new tab and show the New Tab Page
2/ Modify zoom level (Ctrl+ or Ctrl-)
3/ Open a 2nd new tab


Actual results:

In the 2nd new tab, zoom level is set to default.
In the 1st new tab, modified zoom level reverts to default.

Of course, if you quit Firefox, the zoom level is not retained.


Expected results:

Zoom level for New Tab Page should be retained.

Confirmed, setting to NEW
It should not zoom at all in my opinion ...
Would you care to share some reasoning for this opinion? :)
If Bug 699362 is to be fixed , clearly it is expected to act how the addon manager acts , which thus doesn't allow you to zoom in.

Besides that , although we can provide option to increase thumbnail size , an user won't like to see a messy new tab with zoomed in thumbnails and scroll bars to pan it. Instead , a sober list with thumbnails should be presented which makes it easy to choose desired "predicted" page.

New Tab Page is not a webpage which requires "close inspection" etc...
Zooming is useful for visually impaired people. This has nothing to do with close inspection.
Of course , for that zooming the page makes lesser sense than zooming thumbnail sizes , just like Opera and Safari ... 

Well that's just my opinion :|
Created attachment 618408
Removed isBlankPageURL condition and used about:blank instead of it because when the url is about:newtab the zoom level must be applied.

This patch was in a range which caused a Ts regression, so I backed out the whole range:

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/24a6a53c714a

Please reland after investigating and fixing the regression.
Relanded because this is unlikely to be the cause of the Ts regression. We'll watch the graphs closely though.
