Pushing the patches in bug 789102 to try makes a test of it fail:

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=593ba2669686
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser_586068-apptabs.js | an unexpected uncaught JS exception reported through window.onerror - NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Failure at chrome://browser/content/browser.js:4553

That failure's source is tabPreviews.capture(), respectively the drawWindow() call in it. It fails because we're trying to do that for a pending tab with an innerWidth of zero.

The tab seems to be selected and we're kicking off a timeout for tabPreviews.capture(). In the meanwhile another session will be restored that puts the tab in pending mode again. tabPreview.capture() should just check for the pending attribute and do nothing if it's present.
