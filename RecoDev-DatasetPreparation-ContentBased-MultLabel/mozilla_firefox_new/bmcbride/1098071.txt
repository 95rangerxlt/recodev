Once upon a time, we had browser/modules/test/uitour.js in the tree for testing, and https://github.com/Unfocused/mozilla-uitour/ for WebDev use - as there were some differences between them. Unfortunately, a few times the in-tree testing version was updated and the Github version wasn't - which made things a bit of a mess.

Now days, the two files are identical. So the aim is to retire the Github repo, and just use the in-tree version.

To ensure that it's clear the in-tree version is used in production on mozilla.org (and not just our unit-tests), uitour.js should be moved out of /tests/.

Patch v1

Figured I better do this now before its forgotten...

Realised the JS lib doesn't fit where existing UITour files are (browser/modules and browser/base/content). And having everything spread around the place is non-optimal. So now we have browser/components/uitour to hold it all.

I like this idea but I would rather we do this after I have to uplift all the Loop tour stuff so I don't have to rebase all my patches for uplift. If you think `hg transplant` can handle this automatically then I guess it's fine to land. I was also thinking about moving the tests to their own directory recently.

Oh, indeed - this can wait to land. This patch shouldn't bitrot, and even if it does, the Loop stuff has priority.

FTR, hg doesn't seem to transplant/graft this automatically and we're uplifting stuff to 36. I probably should have just requested uplift on this bug but for some reason I didn't think of it and instead figured out a workaround to get HG to rebase.
