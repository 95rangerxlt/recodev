should be tested again after bug 1070778.

I'm not sure why but it doesn't seem to work for me, I tried a couple rebuilds but nothing..

when I move to a switch to tab entry and I press shift, the switch to tab text should be replaced by the url but that doesn't happen.

autocomplete.xml got bitrotten, am wondering if that was your issue. This patch is the same as the previous, just rebased.
