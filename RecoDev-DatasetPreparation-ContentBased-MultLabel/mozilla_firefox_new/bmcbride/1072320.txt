Doesn't the changes in head.js make this unnecessary now?
Er, yes. I'd meant to delete that (leftover from the first patch).

Patch v3

*sigh* So, that previous patch helped. But turns out it doesn't fully fix it.

At this point I'm just giving up, given how much time I've sunk into this. Linux is known to be fragile when it comes to both popups and focus, and I don't think we gain anything by dedicating more time to the Linux-only intermittent issues of these tests. Therefore, I think we should just skip them on Linux.

why browser_autocomplete_a11y_label.js and browser_action_keyword.js are not failing like this test?
is there anything we do differently here?
If I look at them, in those 2 tests you first type in the autocomplete and then wait for the popup. in this test you do the opposite, so the event listener is set at a different time.

That said, I'm fine to disable these if we get a bug filed to investigate this specific failure and make promiseSearchComplete infallible.

PS: this implementation I found uses executeSoon: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/newtab/browser_newtab_search.js#376
would be worth to see if adding executeSoon to promisePopupShown (thus 2 ticks, 1 for soon and 1 for resolution) solves the perma orange on Try, just to have some additional data for the bug you are going to file.

I'd be very happy if you'd file a bug to fix promiseSearchComplete and you'd annotate the bug # here and just above promiseSearchComplete

why are you not skipping browser_autocomplete_a11y_label.js too? It looks like doing the same.

please add a scary warning above this pointing to the newly filed bug for promiseSearchComplete on Linux, and explaining using this is not orange-safe on Linux.

I *think* you might even do

That test doesn't try to interact with the result - it only inspects it. It's interacting with the result that (AFAICT) fails.
