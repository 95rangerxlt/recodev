We are currently working on improving the Firefox desktop onboarding experience. This includes First Run and Update pages. Our first focus is the Australis Update experience. (see a video of our prototype, here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X54Ur_Cp0io)


We would like to use telemetry to detect if the Australis Update tab is active while a user is interacting with the browser chrome. We want to be able to distinguish interactions that occur while the tab is active vs. those that happen once it has been closed or is inactive.

When talking with Mike and Blake, it also seemed possible to know if the Update tab was closed x minutes ago, for instance. Can you confirm if this is possible?

I can provide a specific URL for this tab before this goes live in Aurora. Our goal is to have this ready for Aurora, but it is likely that it will be ready a couple of weeks into Aurora and not right away.

Hi Mike and Blake, any progress on this?
Hey Holly,

Yes, we're going to assign this to Blair, who's more familiar with the work going on in UITour land.

I volunteer for reviewing duty on these.

Same answer for your other needinfo, so I'll clear that.

This fixes both this bug and bug 952567, since they're so closely linked.

I'm purposefully *not* recording URLs here - since IMO that's too broad and too specific (especially considering we eventually want to use UITour APIs for things like SUMO). Instead, the page gets the chance to specify it's own unique identifier and we track things based on that. 

For counting interactions with browser chrome, everything is now put into "buckets". The default bucket is "__NORMAL__" (ie, we always have a bucket name) to help with querying the data.

I haven't done this for durations, because there's no clear behaviour for what should happen if a bucket changes when were still timing a duration (also, it wouldn't actually work with UITour anyway - since UITour sessions end as soon as you switch tabs). And I'm not cleanly handling the case where UITour sets a bucket, and then some other area of code sets a bucket, and then unsets it - because we don't need that yet.
Technical details for implementing this in the page: 

The page will want to register it's unique identifier every time it detects the document is visible, via the page visibility API. Like so:

  Mozilla.UITour.registerPageID("my-unique-id");
Hey Holly,

So, here's how this patch seems to work:

When the user is viewing a tour, UITelemetry starts putting ALL UI interaction probes into a bucket, keyed off of a unique ID that the tour page provides.

If the user is *not* viewing a tour (it might still be open in a background tab, or it may have been closed down), all UI interaction probes are put back into the default bucket.

Is this going to give you the data that you need? Or did the tour "bucket" need to persist until the end of the session?

Will we still need this?

-Mike
Hi Mike, 

Thanks for explaining. If the user has the tab open, but is not currently viewing the tab, we will still want the interactions to show up in the tour "bucket". One use case we have to support this is: During the tour, we notice many users opening up the Customization tab directly from the menu panel when we are talking about it in the tour. Then they switch back to the tour tab and finish the rest of the steps. 

With how it is implemented now, if I understand correctly, we wouldn't be able to track the customization interactions because these take place in a different tab (and therefore, the tab containing the tour wouldn't be viewed at this time). This is just one example.

We would like to know if the tab exists in the browser at the time of interaction with elements in the browser. Is this possible?

Also, when interactions are being placed in the tour "bucket" are they also being put into the  "__NORMAL__" default bucket? Or is there only one bucket/ID being taken at a time.  


The other item mentioned (about the tab being closed x minutes ago) is a nice to have.

Ok, thanks for explaining that, Holly. I think I have a way of doing each of those without too much trouble.

Only one buckets is active at a time - so we never record an event more than once. We can merge the buckets when performing analysis, if need be.
Created attachment 8371201
Patch v1

Major changes from the previous revision:

* Supporting buckets for customization durations. I realized (at least for customize mode), that it makes sense to track a duration based on what bucket was active when the duration *started*.
* Added support for "expiring buckets", which are kind of like a countdown timer. Except you specify timing steps, so you can specify non-linear times, and it counts up. So you end up with times X minutes *after* an event. Once the bucket expires, it reverts back to the default bucket. The names of expiring buckets are in the form "bucket_NAME|TIME". For UITour, we further break that down - see below. Rationale for expiring buckets is that it doesn't make sense to keep tracking that a tour page was closed last week.
* When a tour page tab is closed, we start an expiring bucket based in that page's registered ID. Bucket name is in the form "bucket_UITour|PAGEID|closed|TIME". Time steps are 1 min, 3 min, 10 min, 1 hour (already checked with Holly this is good).
* Ditto for tour pages that are make inactive (person switches to another tab). Same time steps, bucket name is in the form "bucket_UITour|PAGEID|inactive|TIME".
* TIME in the above two points is in the form "1m", "3m", "10m", "1h".

Uh…  I believe we want to be able to see how the tour that the user saw affected their behaviour.  Won't not tracking the tour page lose the connection between which tour the user saw, and their future behaviour, or is that tracked in a different bucket?

I'm (hopefully understandably) a little nervous about throwing away data.  ;)

What about aTimeOffset? Looking at the function, it's probably supposed to be used only during the recursion, but we should probably mention that.

Oh, we still record that separately inside UITour.jsm itself. Sorry, should have mentioned that.
(In reply to Mike Conley (:mconley) from comment #11)
> dev-doc-needed on this?

Oh, yes!

The tabbrowser TabSelect event has a new addition. It's not a CustomEvent with a 'detail' property, which has a 'previousTab' property that specifies the tab that was previously selected, but made inactive by this event.

Oh, yes. I could have made it completely private, but I didn't see any downside in exposing it - we may find some legit use for it in the future, and there's certainly no harm in using it.

That's making the copy of the array, so we can safely modify it. Otherwise we end up modifying the array that external code has passed to us - in the case of UITour, it's a global variable we re-use (a pattern I'd expect other code to follow). I'd added a comment to clarify this.

Nit: You could export this value so you don't need to duplicate it in UITour.jsm: 
A) Prefix this const with BROWSER_UI_TELEMETRY_ (or something similar) and add it to EXPORTED_SYMBOLS.

I think there is an issue if a user has multiple tour tabs open with the same page ID (likely more common after bug 966933) but I think that's an edge case that we probably don't need to worry much about.

Because it doesn't support modules that export multiple symbols :( Bug 732385. But I'll fake it with defineLazyGetter.

Oh, hm, yea. Not sure if there's a simple way of dealing with that. Left it for a followup bug for now - bug 969221. If need be, we can revisit when we do bug 966933.
