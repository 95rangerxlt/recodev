Bug 693808 added a domain whitelist for URI fixups. Unfortunately, it currently only applied when using keyword searches. For bug 951624 I want to use this while not allowing keyword searches (so it can reliably handle those separately).

So I'd like to introduce a new flag that specifies that the domain whitelist is required. This flag would be implied when FIXUP_FLAG_ALLOW_KEYWORD_LOOKUP is specified.

This is part of the effort to split up bug 951624, which keeps growing in size.

Patch v3

Split out from the latest patch in bug 951624, with review comments from bug 951624 comment 42 and bug 951624 comment 43 resolved.
Hi Blair, apologies for the delay.  Bug has been added to IT 34.3.  Thanks.
Might not be trivial to merge this with bug 494092, but looking both anyway.

It doesn't really imply that.
FIXUP_FLAG_ALLOW_KEYWORD_LOOKUP doesn't _require_ a whitelisted host

Drop 'Implied by FIXUP_FLAG_ALLOW_KEYWORD_LOOKUP' but add perhaps a comment that 
FIXUP_FLAG_ALLOW_KEYWORD_LOOKUP overrides FIXUP_FLAG_REQUIRE_WHITELISTED_HOST.
