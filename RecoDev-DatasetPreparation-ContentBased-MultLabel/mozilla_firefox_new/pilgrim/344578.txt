Steps to reproduce:

1. Run WindowEyes (tested with v5.5K)
2. Run a trunk build of Firefox that has the newly reorganized preferences window
3. Tools / Options / Security pane
4. Tab to Settings button in Warning Messages groupbox

Results:

WindowEyes speaks "Warning Messages.  Settings.  Button."

Expected results:

WindowEyes should speak the text of the associated label, i.e. "Warning Messages.  Settings.  Button.  Choose which warning messages you want to see while browsing the web."

Firefox 1.5 got this right in most places, for example the Settings button to configure clearing private data (in the Privacy pane).

The problem is almost certainly a lack of a control attribute on the description that points to the ID of the Settings button.  If this appears to be correct, then it's possible that the problem is solved by bug 343661, in which case, well, never mind.

add control attribute on description

As suspected, the description lacked a control attribute that associated it with the button.
Mark you should land this on trunk immediately so we let it bake for a few days before landing on 1.8 branch.
