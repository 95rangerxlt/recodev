This is a meta bug where we will list the bugs for the combined Sun/IBM team to fix in the short term, before we start to implement new-atk content/doc changes on the trunk.

New-atk: http://www.mozilla.org/access/unix/new-atk.html

By implementing these before we do new-atk, we can avoid having to rewrite a lot of the fixes. New-atk will cause a lot of code to move around on the trunk, so we should try to fix many things while Firefox 2 & 3 are basically the same.

The kinds of bugs we should fix in this timeframe:
Crashes, leaks, XUL accessibility issues
