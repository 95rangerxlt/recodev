in bug 1057512 we are looking to run tests per directory instead of a large chunk.  This causes some tests to fail that depend on services being setup by an earlier test (or time). here is a try server push:

Socialapi tests are all independent.  This is probably caused by bug 1095457.
I pushed to try with the patch from bug 1095457 and it didn't help.  Maybe this is related to time the browser has been running?  I know a lot of services are doing delayed startup, browser_addons.js is the first test to run, so it could be that we need to do something else until all services are properly intialized.

The init of socialapi does start in delayedStartup and after session restore. I'm not sure how/when tests are started, but if they start before session restore that could be an issue (in more than just socialapi). Looking at the code in browser.js, I'm also uncertain whether the browser-delayed-startup-finished notification would be late enough.

This error at the start of the tests in the social directory feels suspect (not saying it's the cause, but a concern?)

I'll try this on osx today and see if I can repro, otherwise will try it on linux tomorrow.
well, osx was fine.  when I run on linux, I get an ssl cert problem and I'm not sure if that is some config issue on my vm, or a general problem, but it happens in the same place you're timing out:


./mach mochitest-browser --e10s --run-by-dir browser/base/content/test/social/

...

it looks like the time on the linux vm is august, ssl will fail then :)

ok, this passes locally on linux, but in order to do so I have to click on the firefox window to bring it to front before that test occurs.  That in particular is a recurring issue I have running mochi tests on linux, the test results window ends up on top, and any ui interactions fail.

Looks to me like the test server has the same problem.

set focus to test window for social tests (1.0)

try server seems to think this is safe for regular mode:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=d7185987036b

testing locally seems to think it works in run-by-dir with e10s!

cool, I had tried focusing the window in testing/mochitest/browser-test.js but it didn't work from there.
