Testcase

Firefox still intends to open links with target="_search" in the sidebar (see URL field), but instead opens them in a new tab, after some sort of ugly failure that shows up in the error console as

[[[
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIStringBundle.GetStringFromName]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: XStringBundle :: getString :: line 17"  data: no]
]]]]

Not sure when, but I'm initially suspicious of bug 370765.

Thanks, but couldn't you have found that someone other than me broke it?

Fix v.1

IE7 no longer supports target="_search", and over the 15 months since I broke it, I'm the only person who noticed, and I was just using it as a convenient way of testing something else. Time to put it to bed.

Fix v.1

driveby r=me, die etc
changeset:   15357:6ee23de41631
IE7 does support it.  Go to the options and see whether "Enable web sites to use the search pane" is checked.

I noticed it although I only reported it 2 months ago.
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430095

One of my web sites in particular ( http://lookwayup.com/ ) makes significant use of it and I'm not looking forward to the changes in the coding and the help required to tell my disproportionately Mozilla users that they are losing this feature.

Fix v.1

Approved for 1.9.0.2. Please land in CVS. a=ss
Phil is out so someone will have to land this on 1.9 for him.
Bunch of lazy SOBs, the lot of you...

browser/base/content/browser.js 1.1036
Verified with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008090212 Firefox/3.0.

3.02 no longer gets the error: 

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIStringBundle.GetStringFromName]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: XStringBundle :: getString :: line 17"  data: no]

Behavior is otherwise the same.
