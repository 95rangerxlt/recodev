This is enough to get it working in SeaMonkey (though they'll probably want to add a support site pref, to get rid of the cruel "support web site" link going to about:blank); I expect Thunderbird will need a bit more work, but we'll see.

I was going to leave behind a comment explaining that there wasn't any need to get the Application object since there's already a global one, but then I noticed that populateExtensionsSection() and getModifiedPrefs() already use the global, so I figured everyone but me already knew that anyway.

And yeah, the inline JS and CSS need to come out, but I'll do them in bug 518989 once it's moved.

We should probably at least add a comment at the top of aboutSupport.xhtml that explains what it depends on (branding package, app.support.baseURL existing, FUEL, more?). Perhaps ideally we should also loosen those dependencies...
The FUEL-alike one is the easiest to drop (and the one Camino is least likely to meet) - we're using it for prefs, but we're also using a gPrefService, and both of those could probably use Services instead if they aren't going to do things directly, and for the app name and version xre/app-info isn't all *that* hard to use.

But, I'm sort of stuck, not wanting to bit-rot myself for bug 518989, which seems to have gathered a strange and unlikely load of controversy. Should I four-step it, move it, move the script out, deal with the script and what that leaves for a dependency list, and then worry about the CSS after that?

Seems reasonable.

Bug 518607 - Move the Troubleshooting Information page into toolkit so other apps like Thunderbird and SeaMonkey can use it, r=gavin 

Bug 518989 followup, accidentally reverted the part of the patch from bug 518607 that removed getting the FUEL Application object instead of using the one that's already in scope, a=1
