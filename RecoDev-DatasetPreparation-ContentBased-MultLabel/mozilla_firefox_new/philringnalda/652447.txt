Fix v.1

Winstripe and Gnomestripe have a browser/skin/livemark-item.png which is the single image of a RSS waveform over a document icon, which they use for the menu icon for items in a livemark folder.

Pinstripe has a browser/skin/livemark-item.png, which contains enabled and disabled versions of that icon, plus two identical sets of the old "this page has feeds" icon from the addressbar in four phases, all of which are unused, and a browser/skin/places/livemarkItem.png which is the single image of a RSS waveform over a document icon, which it uses for the menu icon for items in a livemark folder.

The ten minutes it took me to figure out what Pinstripe was doing, and the five minutes it took me to explain what it was doing, are my justification for making it stop doing it.
