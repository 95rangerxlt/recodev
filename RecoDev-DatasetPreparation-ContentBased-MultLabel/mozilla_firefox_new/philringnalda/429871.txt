Fix v.1

Back in the day, hovered bookmark toolbar folders had a very dark background, so the dropmarker needed to be white to be visible. Now, we have a lighter background, so folders use the same black dropmarker, but live bookmarks, which use a black copy of the livemark icon as a dropmarker, still use a glaring white version on hover.

STR:
1. Add a folder and a live bookmark to the toolbar on OS X
2. Hover the folder, note that the dropmarker is still black, and visible
3. Hover the live bookmark folder, note that the icon/dropmarker is blinding white, and not terribly visible as a result.

Hi, 
the livemarkFolder.png picture is still squeezed. 

the picture comes from a theme from me 
and it looks correct like: 
http://www.takebacktheweb.org/themes/stuff/GrApple-active-inactive.png 

the padding is for the picture size wrong:
now use it:  
 .bookmark-item[livemark] > .toolbarbutton-menu-dropmarker {
   list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/places/livemarkFolder.png");
   padding: 4px 4px 3px 2px;
 }

but it is build for: 
.bookmark-item[livemark] > .toolbarbutton-menu-dropmarker {
list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/places/livemarkFolder.png");
padding: 3px 4px 3px 4px 
}
and the same would work as well in the Mac default theme. 

Cheers 



Sheesh, nice job of checking in on my part.

Aronnax: while in this case, it looks like Kevin either did see your comment, or had already spotted that, since that change is in the patch in bug 430202, in general commenting about something else in a closed bug is the single most effective way of *not* being heard. Bug numbers are cheap, we can afford to have you file a new one any time you spot something new.
