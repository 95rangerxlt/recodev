Hm, I see that the whole folder preferences is missing in firefox\chrome\classic.jar\skin\classic\browser\

This appears to have been broken by Bug 328243.  That was when an #ifdef MOZ_PLACES was added to classic's jar manifest and options.png is not in that ifdef while it is in the else.

Perhaps this was done because the icons are going to be updated as part of the planned Visual/UI Refresh of Firefox.



No, it's a mistake, we're not going to make the refresh ifdef places ;)
In Mac OS X builds, the icons are missing from the Preferences as well, and the text seems to have lost its formatting (see especially the Privacy tab). I presume this is the same bug?

Branch, winstripe only.
In my extension UI Tweaker, I have a pref window and 5 icons in...but only the middle icon is missing. Wonder why only that one and not all or none.

Maybe you're using a theme? :D
AHh I know why, I'm linking to it that icon only which exists in the classic.jar.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
