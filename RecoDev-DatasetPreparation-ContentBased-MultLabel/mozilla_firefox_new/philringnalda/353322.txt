Not sure that this should actually prompt an RC2 on it's own, but if the fix is simple and we end up having an RC2 for some other reason, we should probably look at taking a fix for this...

Incidentally, the location bar when dragged into the palette is a little messed up too, though not as bad. The location bar in the palette does not show the dropdown and the 'Go' endcap. Is it worth filing another bug?

It's always worth filing another bug, yes. Whether or not that bug is worth nominating for blocking is another question (I wouldn't say we'd block on it) but we should have it on file so it eventually gets fixed.

Not taking for FF2.

I have filed Bug 353438 for this. ;)
Here's how it breaks in Win98.  Same general behavior, somewhat different appearance.

shows Search Bar item in Customize Toolbars palette on Win98, looking strange
CCing self.  Thought this weird look might be a screwed up FF install on my machine, but turns out it's a bug with FF2 itself.  Certain themes seem to fix it, eg. macbirdgraphite (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3968/).  I'd probably try and fix this, but, well... I can't be bothered.  Leave it to the theme people.

searchbar.css uses |toolbar[stuff] .search-go-yadda| as selectors to manage the scaling differences between text and icon mode, so those selectors don't apply in the palette. Instead, it needs to apply all the rules for icon mode with just |.search-go-yadda|, and then overrule them with |toolbar[mode="text"]|, without regressing any of bug 353149, bug 352681, bug 348138, or bug 351618 (which blame says were the causes of the current state).

Fix v.1

Hmm, a smart person probably would have looked at your fix for bug 353438 before figuring it out and patching it, not after.

Still, I like my approach better, since I know I for one wouldn't have guessed that I have to keep the id in customizeToolbar.xul in sync with a css file in browser/. Making it look the same everywhere except a mode="text" toolbar just feels safer than making it look the same on either a not([mode="text"]) toolbar or a palette-box.

Fix v.1

But but.. this shrinks the space between the search button to its on-hover border (probably due to padding: 0px; rule).

Fix v.2

Pushed me into finally setting up a Windows build environment that could handle trunk (which I guess is a good thing) since I couldn't see what you meant, building it on Linux. Turns out, that's because Linux was broken, and didn't have any padding on the button before my patch, so I couldn't see it disappearing.
