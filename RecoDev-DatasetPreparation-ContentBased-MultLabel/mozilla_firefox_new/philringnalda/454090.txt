Fix v.1

Thanks to bug 305064, nsSearchService.js no longer needs to roll its own sTrim() function.

I saw as I was looking at what I was attaching that I made one logic change, from lowercase-then-trim to trim-then-lowercase, but I'd be rather surprised by any character that turns into a space when lowercased, and not lowercasing spaces ought to save several femtoseconds.
