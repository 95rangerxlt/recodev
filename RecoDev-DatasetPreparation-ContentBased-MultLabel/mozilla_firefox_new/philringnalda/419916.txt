Bug 415928 added an #ifdef MOZ_MEMORY to removed-files.in to remove the CRT files we don't need with jemalloc, but left packages-static groping around still trying to package them. If we ifndef them, then the build log will only have the enormous spew of expected errors from jemalloc itself to hide real problems beneath :)

I totally noticed this and then forgot to do anything about it. At least I got packages-static, right?

"got packages-static" how? Unless I'm confused, you got removed-files.in, and *didn't* get packages-static.
Yeah, apparently I didn't get my brain to work either. You'll get r=me on a patch, though!

Fix v.1

Hmm, looking at this patch (without any real understanding) makes me wonder whether we need an #else in removed-files.in to remove mozcrt19.dll when you hypothetically update/install a non-jemalloc build on top of a jemalloc one.

You could do that for the theoretical purity of it, but I'm not really worried about it. Your choice.

a1.9b4=beltzner, reed convinced me that this makes the testing of 2.x -> 3.0bx easier
reed's a liar.

> reed's a liar.

Considering all the work cf has been doing in bug 394046 to keep these files correct, I think we would like to do this sooner rather than later, especially if the Build team wants to do a major update test from Fx2 to Fx3b4.
Yeah, but this file has no impact on that. I fixed removed-files.in. This just fixes a warning in the build process.

Fixing extraneous warnings == making Build team happier that they don't have to worry that such a warning is for something real or not.
