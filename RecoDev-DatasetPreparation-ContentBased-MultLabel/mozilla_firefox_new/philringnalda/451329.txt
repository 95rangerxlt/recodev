Fix v.1

In 1.0, we would "discover" a "feed" from any link with "RSS" or "rss" or "Atom" anywhere in the title attribute, getting false positives from things like <link rel="alternate" type="application/pdf" title="PDF of Chapter 3: Atom and RSS"> or title="scissorssharpening". For 1.5, I cut that back to only text/xml, application/xml, and application/rdf+xml, and only a case-insensitive space-separated "rss", which we still use today. At the time, it seemed like a good idea, to get the default WordPress RSS 0.92 feed link (which no longer exists) and to let people with RSS 1.0 use their shiny new mimetype, but since it was pure invention, it's not doing a thing to promote interop.

IE7 and Opera don't discover either one, although Safari and SeaMonkey will discover both, and the utterly bogus false positive title="érss" to boot.

HTML5 makes no provision for altering the type of a link based on characters in the title, meeting the needs of people who feel they have to use a type other than application/rss+xml or application/atom+xml with type="feed".
