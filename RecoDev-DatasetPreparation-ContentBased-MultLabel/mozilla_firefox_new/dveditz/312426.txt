Example of used code :

<head>
<title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<button onclick="window.open('wnd.html','wnd', 'height=200')">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>

File "wnd.html":
<html>
<head>
<title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
The dash is indeed misgging, at least on mac.
This is a mac-only issue, we keep mTitleSeparator empty on mac as part of the
hack in nsContentTreeOwner::XULWindow.

Gah, already did this once :-(.  304388's checkin of bug 22183's patch should

patch for bug 282955 checked into trunk and 1.8 branch


[Mac] There's neither a dash nor a space between the url to the page title in popups's titlebar (was: Window opened with window.open method has wrong title)

fixed1.8, regression
