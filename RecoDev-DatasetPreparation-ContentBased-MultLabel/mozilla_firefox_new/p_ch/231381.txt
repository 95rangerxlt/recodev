Alt+D no longer selects the entire URL in the location bar. It merely moves the
caret focus to the end of the URL in the location bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Alt+D (while on any site that doesn't remap Alt+D to something else)
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Caret focus is moved to the end of whatever URL or text is in the Location Bar

Expected Results:  
The entire contents of the Location Bar should be selected so that they can be
overwritten by immediately typing.

The bug has been introduced in the last day, because the following build worked
fine for me:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040117 Firebird/0.8.0+

--> All/All
This checkin appears to be the cause:

I also see this bug if I click the address bar.

pch checked that in, so assigning to him.

pch's patch looks correct except that it mixes #ifdef with #elif.  It should use
#if and #elif, or #ifdef and #elifdef.  I don't know if using the wrong
preprocessor command would cause this bug.
I tried changing it to #elifdef, and still got two gClickSelectsAll lines in the
output (first is true, second is false). I think this is likely a pre-processor bug.

When it reaches the elifdef, it takes the true value off (if we're on Windows,
of course), and pushes false onto it's stack
(http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/config/preprocessor.pl#350). Then, when
it gets to the #else, it simply assumes that inverting the stack's value is
correct (http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/config/preprocessor.pl#334).

I don't know if this is expected behaviour, but it seems wrong to me.

Repaces #elif usage with only #ifdef/#else/#endif
Pierre has checked in a fix for Windows (and I've confirmed that it works):

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?diff_mode=context&whitespace_mode=show&subdir=mozilla/browser/base/content&command=DIFF_FRAMESET&file=browser.js&rev1=1.267&rev2=1.268&root=/cvsroot

We still need a fix for Linux. Am setting bug to All/Linux.

Repaces #elif usage with only #ifdef/#else/#endif

Making patch obsolete, since Pierre has already checked in an equivalent fix.
James: sorry, I haven't seen your patch
that's fixed on linux (branch+trunk) as well, but please, test well the *branch*


Alt+D no longer selects all text in Location Bar -- it moves cursor to the end of the text there
