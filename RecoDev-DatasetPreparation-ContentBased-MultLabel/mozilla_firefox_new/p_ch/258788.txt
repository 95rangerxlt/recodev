The following patch does the following for GNOME:
- shift-ctrl-Z for redo
- ctrl-A for select all
- ctrl-Y for the download manager

in addition for the mac, it shows shift-accel-Z for redo (that's one that we
actually implement) instead of accel-Y, as specified in the apple HIG.

in the undo section)

For the Ctrl-K part, I just moved its duplicated definition out of the #ifdef
since it's now a xp shortcut and commented to make clear that ctrl-J is still
needed in case the user has chosen the emacs bindings.

requesting r=bryner, a=ben
msg from pch to aviary:

Since bryner's native keybinding patch has landed I think that the GNOME default
edit keybindings should be reflected in the UI (ctrl-A, shift-ctrl-Z). I've
written a patch in bug 258788. and I am requesting a quick r=bryner and a=ben if
it's not too late. I won't be able to check it in before sth like 11-12pm EST,
so feel free to drive it if it is approved.

pch
bryner not sure about the patch, so we should just consider this for final at
this point.

a=asa (on behalf of the aviary team) for checkin to the aviary branch.
pch checked this into aviary on 2004-09-16 12:05.
Shouldn't this bug be closed? The patch has been applied and it works for me in
the 1.0 RC
Fixed on trunk by the aviary landing.
