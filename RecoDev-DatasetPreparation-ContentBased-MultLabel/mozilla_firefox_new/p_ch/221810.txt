I have the "Bookmarks Toolbar" activated by default. Upon opening the browser,
the "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" contents do not appear on the "Bookmarks Toolbar"
until the "Manage Bookmarks" menu item in the "Bookmarks" menu is selected. The
bookmarks do not appear as well until "Manage Bookmarks" is selected. Once the
"Manage Bookmarks" item is selected, the bookmark folders appear, but upon
clicking a bookmark within the folder, nothing happens (the URL is not loaded in
the active window).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Bookmark Toolbar Folder, populated with links
2.Active Bookmark Toolbar (View - Toolbars - Bookmarks Toolbar)
3.Close and re-open Firebird
4.Bookmark Toolbar will be activated, but no folders appear
5.Click on Bookmarks - Manage Bookmarks
6.The folder(s) on the Bookmarks Toolbar will appear
7.Try clicking on the bookmark in the folder -- the URL is not loaded

Actual Results:  
The bookmark folders appeared, but the links within them are non-functional.

Expected Results:  
The bookmark toolbar folders should appear when the browser is opened (with the
Bookmarks Toolbar Folder activated), and the links within the folders should
take the user to the bookmark URL.

A step-by-step screen capture of the issue.
this is fine for me, Dain, are you still seeing this with a current nightly?
I just downloaded yesterdays build (11/9/03) and this issue is resolved. -Dain
i have this problem under linux, gtk, firefox 1.5-rc2 and -rc1, but a little different. the bookmarks never show up in the bookmarks menu untill i open up the bookmakrs sidebar. cant figure out if someone else reported it either... 
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


Bookmarks and Bookmark folders do not appear until "Manage Bookmarks" is selected.
