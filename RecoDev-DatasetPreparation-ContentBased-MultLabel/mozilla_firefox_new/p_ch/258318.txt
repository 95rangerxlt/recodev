I overlooked that.

The rule that no more apply (from autocomplete.css) is this one:
toolbarpaletteitem > toolbaritem > textbox > hbox > hbox > html|*.textbox-input {
  visibility: hidden;
}

we could...
1) replace it with:
toolbarpaletteitem > toolbaritem textbox > hbox > hbox > html|*.textbox-input {
  visibility: hidden;
}
using the descendent selector.

2) or add the rule:
toolbarpaletteitem > toolbaritem > * > textbox > hbox > hbox >
html|*.textbox-input {
  visibility: hidden;
}

3) or put a searchbar specific rule in searchbar.css

Althought (1) is tempting, I would prefer (2) because the descendent selector is
really expensive and because it could still benefit extension makers unlike (3).

gor, I hope rules like the former ones are going to be loaded inside the
customizable toolbar palette window only! Do what you think is best.
