This combines the buttons and removes the extra margins that were noted before. 

As I mentioned in the previous bug, the toolbaritems are still a bit too wide, but I can't figure out how to get them any narrower.

The comment is only for the second rule and since the margin has a different purpose for each rule, the property can be moved to the two existing rulesets:
  #social-provider-button
  .social-notification-container > .toolbarbutton-1
Thanks, I made the changes on the patch that got landed.
