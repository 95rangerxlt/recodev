This has been bugging me - we've got two columns in the panel, and this big gap on the right (but not enough of a gap to get more buttons in there). So I think we just need to make the panel wider.

I've noticed that the right border of the panel is missing for some reason (with or without this patch). I'll file a separate bug for that.
