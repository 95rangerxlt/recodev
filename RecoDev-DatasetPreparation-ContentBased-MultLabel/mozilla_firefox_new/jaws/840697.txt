The Australis customization work will obsolete the Firefox appmenu button.

This is a nice, small, atomic piece that can probably land on the UX branch pretty early, which will help with testing and themeing (both for Australis customization and the tab-strip).

Nothing fancy here - I'm just adding a pref, and checking for it in updateAppButtonDisplay. I don't set a pref observer or anything, to the change manifests after a restart.

This is my first gut-reaction to the bug. Am I missing any cases?

This is fine for UX branch, but it's really more code that will need to be deleted when we land the new Panel Menu. If this is only for the UX branch, should we just land a patch that removes the app menu altogether?

Hm - so, after our meeting, I was under the impression that we just wanted to be able to pref off the AppMenu button for now, so that people who want to test UX without it (like folks working on the new menu button) can do so with little difficulty.

Straight-up removing it is something that I certainly think we should do down the road, but perhaps we should leave that until we have the alternative ready to go.

Let me know if I'm off-base here - this is just what I got from the meeting.

Yeah, that's what we discussed at the meeting. I thought about it more and came to the other conclusion.

This will be easier to take in the interim, so we can see what pains the new Menu Panel brings us.
Landed on UX as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/3bea5e3b11f4

As this is almost certainly never going to ever land on mozilla-central (since we'll have removed the AppMenu button by the time we start moving stuff over), am I good to mark this RESOLVED FIXED?
Hm, that's a good question. I'd say we can call it RESOLVED-FIXED since it has fulfilled its purpose.
