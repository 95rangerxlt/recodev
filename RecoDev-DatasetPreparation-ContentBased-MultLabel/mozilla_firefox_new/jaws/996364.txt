The first time through defaultCollapsed is set to true then stored in gAreas. The second time that setting is retrieved from gAreas then we hit this if statement which makes us throw if aInternalCaller is false. You probably want to only throw if defaultCollapsed was passed in aProperties here.

Yes.
(I'm a little surprised this didn't get caught by automated testing... we should make sure we do write such a test now; it'll be pretty trivial)
Jared, feel free to steal, but otherwise I will probably pick this up my morning.

Drive by - this looks pretty good to me. Nice tests.

I'm curious to know - what happens if "overflowable" or "legacy", or any of the other registerArea object properties change from one registration to the other?

r=me, although mconley makes a good point. Up to you whether you want to take care of this here or in a followup.

I'll file a separate bug for the things that mconley mentioned.
