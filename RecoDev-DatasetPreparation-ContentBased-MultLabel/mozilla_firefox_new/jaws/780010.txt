To match the other SocialAPI tests, we should rename browser_shareButton.js to browser_social_shareButton.js. The test should also be refactored to use the generic socialAPI functions defined in head.js.

I've attached a start of a patch that also sets a profile when testing the share button.

Why this change? It's generally better for tests to explicitly remove the tabs they add, rather than introducing "catch all" cleanup code that might wallpaper over other issues.

I meant to undo this change. It was one of the things I was doing to try to narrow down the leaks. The next version of this patch won't have it in there.

Reinstate the share button test

fairly trivial update to the test to make things work.  FWIW, this patch is in the try run at https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=1e0b679f0a6b
