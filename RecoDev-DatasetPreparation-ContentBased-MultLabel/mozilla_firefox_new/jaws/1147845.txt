Drop redundant check

I'm not sure how bug 1137909 comment 13 led to adding OS checks but IDs are different between apps or addons would break.

Thanks for the link, I missed that in the review as I thought the IDs were the same.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: regression between patch revisions of the new feature in bug 1137909: attachment 8572227 vs. attachment 8572886
[User impact if declined]: less feature parity with Linux <- blocked downloads cannot be unblocked on Tier3 platforms (Solaris and various BSDs)
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: m-c, m-i, Try in comment 2
[Risks and why]: Low, at worst (typos?) either errors in console or the feature enabled on non-Desktop platforms (Android, B2G, etc)
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
