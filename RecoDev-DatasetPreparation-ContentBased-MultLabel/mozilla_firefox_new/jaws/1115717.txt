Screenshot of bug

The current dialog (screenshot attached), uses "mode" a couple times. In both cases, the word can be left out and the text will be read clearer.

Currently:
"If you close all Private Browsing windows now, 1 download will be canceled. Are you sure you want to leave the Private Browsing mode?

[Cancel 1 Download] [Stay in Private Browsing mode]"

Proposed change:
"If you close all Private Browsing windows now, 1 download will be canceled. Are you sure you want to leave Private Browsing?

[Cancel 1 Download] [Stay in Private Browsing]"

This looks good as an incremental improvement, but...

We should look into using PluralForm.jsm (like we do with kDownloadsStringsRequiringPluralForm). Might be worth doing at least for this message.

More in general I think we're quite pedantic in all those messages :-) We express the "cancel downloads" concept three times (including the window title), we say whatever action the user just did three other times, and we say the exact number of downloads being canceled two times.

Also, "Cancel All Downloads" is not quite correct when closing the last private window, only private downloads are canceled.

What I envision is something like:

Window title (no PluralForm, same everywhere):
  Cancel Downloads
Message Line 1 (no PluralForm, based on action to clarify why we're asking):
  You're closing the last Private Browsing window. / You're about to exit. / ...
Message Line 2 (PluralForm, different only for Private Browsing):
  1 download will be canceled if you continue.
  1 private download will be canceled if you continue.
OK Button (PluralForm):
  Cancel Download
  Cancel Downloads
Cancel Button:
  Don't Exit / Stay Online / Stay in Private Browsing / ...

The reason for separating line 1 and 2 is that some locales may have three or four plural forms, this reduces the number of combinations to translate.

Line 1 is to make super clear why we're asking, but we maybe we can make the button serve the purpose. In fact, this dialog is always user-triggered and synchronous, so maybe we can get rid of that line completely, saving our localizers some work.

Opinions? If it sounds good, we may get a UX/Localizer review and do this instead.

Yeah I think these are good recommendations and something that we could improve upon, but this isn't something that has been prioritized so I don't want to spend a bunch of time reworking it right now.

Also, some of the strings come in through nsDownloadManager.cpp and I'm not sure how that can get access to PluralForm.
