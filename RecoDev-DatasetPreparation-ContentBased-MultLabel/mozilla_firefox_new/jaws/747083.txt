I've yet to decide if I'd like a gray padlock for broken/faulty HTTPS, but I definitely believe good non-EV HTTPS should still give a visual clue (i.e. blue hue matching "Larry")

My 2Â¢

Is this icon sufficiently visible on dark backgrounds?
Yes, see this screenshot for an example using High Contrast #2 http://screencast.com/t/v2AT5mMe

What is the next step on this bug? Do we still want to do this?
