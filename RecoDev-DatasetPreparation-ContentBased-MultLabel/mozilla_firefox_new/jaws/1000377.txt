<jaws> why don't we show the Bookmarks Toolbar as a toggle-able option in the Customize mode on OSX?
— jaws reads through bug 940669
<shorlander> jaws: only appears when you have more than one toolbar available. Not sure what the rationale was.
<jaws> shorlander: yeah it doesn't make sense to me
<jaws> shorlander: on windows you can use this to show the bookmarks toolbar. on mac this is non existant
<jaws> we don't provide the same path for users on osx and windows. that doesn't seem right
<madhava> I think it's only there if you have at least one toolbar other than the bookmarks bar
<madhava> i.e. toolbars for which there's no other switch
<madhava> which is, yes, odd
<madhava> so, windows uses with the menubar shown will have it
<madhava> anyone with an add-on toolbar will have it
<madhava> I think we should have an Australis 1.1 bug
<madhava> to just always show it
