Does this go away if you add "px" here:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#2016

? (or remove 'px' from the similar definition in the devedition theme, if you're using that - it's not clear from your report!)

It would be quite helpful if the error message from the CSS actually included the string that broke things...

(I'd also argue that either 0 or 1px should work here, but IIRC calc() doesn't like completely unitless things, see also bug 956573 and bug 594933)

Yeah that fixes it for me, and sorry, I should have said it but I'm not using the devtheme.

Error in parsing value for 'margin-bottom' after substituting variables.  Falling back to 'initial'.



Bug 1211221 - Add a unit to the --tab-toolbar-navbar-overlap CSS varialbe to please the calc() parser. r=Gijs
