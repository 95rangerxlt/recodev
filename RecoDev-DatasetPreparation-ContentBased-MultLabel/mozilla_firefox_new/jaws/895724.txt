Review of attachment 778230:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Might be a good idea to do a try push with mochitests as I wouldn't be surprised if a11y or b-c tests break (although I didn't see references to the IDs of the deleted elements).

Will this also have an affect on people downgrading? Will be remove those elements from the placements/currentset if it doesn't exists? (I've heard discussion going both ways on this).

When an item doesn't exist we leave it alone in currentset and just skip over it so I don't expect this to cause any issues.

All green on Try, https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=4b5524687d67
bah, I can't believe I missed this. Well I kinda do: I had to merge browser.xul so many times during the course of bug 755598, that these two buttons must've crept back in, while I explicitly removed them originally.

In other words, since MattN did a try run before with a correct patch, you needn't had to go though all this trouble ;) Too late now!

Glad you fixed it.
