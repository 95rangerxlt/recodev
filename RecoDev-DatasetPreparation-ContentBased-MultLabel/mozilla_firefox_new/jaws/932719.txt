It shouldn't be visible in the toolbar. This is a regression.
I wonder what broke this...

This was a deliberate change. Bug 924933.

Patch

Disabling the min-width on the toolbarbutton for the #zoom-reset-button was necessary to get the .toolbarbutton-text min-width to apply. Also tweaked the values for OSX and Windows to look better.

don't we have OS-specific panelUIOverlay.css files for this?

(I was looking at this patch, because I'm touching the widgets too ;) )
Yeah, we do. We need to have a larger discussion around when we think it is acceptable to place OS-specific styling side-by-side like here or in a separate file. For this case, I felt that it was better to have them close to each other instead of the OS-specific one overriding the shared style.
