Right now, the devtools button is not, by default, in the menu panel (you can add it in customization mode).

This makes sense given our standard inclusion criteria -- it's not used by a very wide audience. That said, this particular 2% audience is an extremely important one, and the developer tools are ones we want to showcase and promote.

We should add the Developer Tools button to the default set in the panel menu. I wouldn't remove anything we have so far -- all those others have earned their place. This will mean we go from a grid of 9 to a grid of 9 plus one more. We lose a bit on visual neatness, but I think it's worth it. This may even end up making more clear that you can add to the menu.

I would thing that adding the developer tools to the default menu for most users is probably not a good idea. Might I suggest instead detecting profiles that have some devtool related prefs set and auto-customizing it in on upgrade just for them?
We won't fixed this in bug 925507. I understand that we want people to find out about developer tools, but it seems we would be putting a useless tool for 98% of users in the menu.

I also think that the lack of symmetry will look awkward, and we have an obvious entrance in to customization right at the bottom of this menu.

98% is a made up number :) In any case, mind share matters more than usage share for this particular feature, and our devtools are one of Firefox's preeminent features that we're trying to actively promote. It doesn't make sense to relegate it to tertiary UI.
This may sound like a dumb question, but what's wrong with just asking? Stick a widget into the first run page that says "are you a web developer? yes, then here's some stuff".

People who don't identify as web developers on one day may identify as web developers in the future.

Yep.



Better more generic solution to the discoverability issue filed as bug 941250.
FWIW, I +1 having this in the panel by default. I've been living with the Character Encoding button dangling at the bottom (since I worked on bug 865916) and I didn't find the lack of symmetry awkward at all.

My reason would also be to promote the DevTools more as to promote web literacy.

Do you have a preference as to where this item should go?
