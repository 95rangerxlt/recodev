Looks like there's no way to access these menus with the mouse anymore.

Looks like there's no way to access these menus with the mouse anymore.
On a whim, marking P2 as I really don't think we want to hide this option for mouse users. There's a cumbersome workaround in re-enabling the menubar.

Asking for UX feedback because I'm not sure what we want to do here:

- Adding it to the history subview would cause sub-subviews, and AFAIK we're explicitly avoiding those, so that doesn't sound like a great idea.

- We could make separate buttons and subviews for them, but that also doesn't sound particularly great (what would the icon look like? Should we have the icon in the menupanel by default?)

- We could also put them under the all-tabs icon? But that'd require showing that icon even on windows with non-overflowing tabs (if there are closed tabs/windows).
Redirecting the needinfo request to get a quicker response...
We could also put them in the History subview, but not as a sub-subview. Instead just place them in another section of the History subview. This might make the subview somewhat taller, but I don't see a huge issue coming from that as long as it will still fit on the screen.
I'll look in to adding these in to the History subview.

This is mostly a copy from browser-places.js for the recently closed tabs + windows.

That's a lot of code to duplicate :\ Can't we at least spin that out to a JSM or something?

Yeah, I'll look in to that.

Moved the code to a new module, could use some suggestions on the names of the module and its methods.

RecentlyClosedTabsAndWindowsMenuUtils? Just "RecentlyClosed" seems too ambiguous.

r+, but there's a bunch of renaming nits. Up to you whether you want to have me have another look when done.

this guy feels a little unimportant without an id. Should we give it one? (I'm not sure why it doesn't have one, while the others do)

I wish we had a better way of doing this. recentlyClosedTabs.innerHTML = '' might work, but makes me feel terrible.

Move this up together with the other removal code, perhaps?

Please don't iterate over an array of 'items', and then have a local variable called 'item' that *isn't* items[i]. Call it element, or node, or menuItem, but not item. And call the items array "closedTabs" or something.

This is almost exactly the above, except s/Tab/Window/. If you don't want to improve that here, can you file a followup to do it?

I agree with DÃ£o that the naming could be better.

Filed bug 926579 as a follow-up to reduce the duplication.

Ah, and I forgot to say... could you land the refactoring part of this (ie patch minus customizableui parts) on m-c as well?

Yes, this was tracked in bug 926928.
Would it be possible to add some (sub)section headers to the view? It now looks funny with some menu items, page titles, more menu items, page titles - only structured with separators. It's hard to make sense of it all.
