We have much higher cpu load from this animation with limited benefit. This animation seems to cause high cpu load even when the throbber is not visible.

This would be bug 962594, which we worked around in bug 1016942. So this shouldn't be happening anymore...
Jeff, is comment 1 wrong?

Yes. I still have high load when non-visible tabs have a spinning throbber. The load is also especially high when the tabs are still visible? Is there a performance comparison somewhere to the previous animated png throbber? I see 39% Nightly cpu usage and 46% WindowServer usage with a visible throbber. Is this expected?

You mean tabs that are scrolled off-screen? Would the png throbber stop animating and straining the CPU in that case?

That's to some extent expected, as the png throbber has a lower frame rate. The CSS animation is expected to be smoother. Another expectation is that off-main-thread animations will alleviate the performance impact.

I'm not sure. I never noticed cpu load from the png throbbers though.

We don't have off-main-thread animations on right now. I expect it might be worth waiting till then before enabling the css-animation.

We've been backing out the CSS throbber from Firefox 32 and 33 and we should probably keep doing that until off-main-thread animations are enabled.

+1 Can we back out the CSS throbber altogether and reland the it after OMTC animations land?
Yeah, I agree, we should just back out. It doesn't appear that OMTC will be enabled on Windows Nightly for quite a few releases still (please correct me if I'm wrong).

This needs Off Main Thread Animations not just OMTC. OMTC will hopefully be in the upcoming release.

Sorry and thanks for the clarification.

jaws - 34 is marked as affected. Can you please submit an Aurora uplift request?
Erm, rather, can you back this out of 34 as I see it has been backed out of 32, 33, and 35?
This was backed out in bug 1016434.
This was verified in bug 1016434.
