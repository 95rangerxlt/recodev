The landing of bug 897496 introduced a 6.57% slowdown on WinXP when entering customization mode. (http://mzl.la/Mv8Vqo)

However, it also shows a 7.24% decrease (improvement) on Win7. (http://mzl.la/Mv8IUj)

This is likely due to the presence of the SVG masks on the toolbarbuttons. We could disable the masks until the transition is complete, which should fix this regression.

Patch

Compare-talos is showing a 4.23% improvement on Win7, a 2.43% improvement on WinXP, a 2.3% improvement on Mac 10.6, and a surprisingly 4.94% regression on Win8. (http://compare-talos.mattn.ca/?oldRevs=1229b7621b39&newRev=c771d1df2c30&server=graphs.mozilla.org&submit=true)

The Win8 regression here doesn't make much sense, and since the other platforms are showing performance improvements I'd like to push this patch forward and request review.

Mike, what do you think about this?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder if the win8 thing is because of the inverse of bug 969458 happening. r=me but please change the attribute name.

Instead, make this a more generic attribute that reflects the customize mode transition, e.g. "customizemode-transitioning".

Also, pass "true" to avoid the coercion here.
Thanks!
