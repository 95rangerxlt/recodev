don't select the compiler

macosx/universal/mozconfig.common forces the compiler to be gcc 4.2. This looks unnecessary and prevents building with clang.

Use gcc-4.2 if CC is not set

Use gcc-4.2 if CC is not set

I was going to originally say that the universal build config is very specific to what we support on tinderbox, but as implemented this patch is fine. Given your latest posts I'd be interested in trying Clang on our official builds in the near future.
I don't see the point in taking this on trunk, we're not going to ship Firefox 4 with clang. We can take it after we ship.

updated patch

This patch also move the test for NATIVE_CPU before we change CC and CXX. This is a bug in the current file, but it only causes problem with xcode4's linker.

In 3.2.5 mbsdiff ends up being linked with the system bz2. With 4 it find the 64 bit bz2 we compiled and stops there.
This can land on the build-system branch:
