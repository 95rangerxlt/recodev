This looks like it's actually the FeedConverter that leaks when something is really bogus. There's a bug in the toolkit parser that causes it to send things twice, but we shouldn't leak no matter what.

fix parser bug and cycle collect SAX

doesn't fix the leak yet, but probably necessary to do so
Is this related to bug 397206?
So far it looks like something different.

cycle collect the SAX parser and nsParser

This makes sense. FeedConverter.js has a reference to the nsParser (as an nsIStreamListener).
Though there are macros that implement all the CC stuff in a single macro when all the members are nsCOMPtrs, I can never remember the name though.
