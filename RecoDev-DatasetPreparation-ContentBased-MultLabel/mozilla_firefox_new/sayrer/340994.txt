Expected behaviour: Either displaying raw XML or a pretty display

Actual behaviour: Tries to use feed preview, but fails miserably displaying the following message
   

There was an error processing this feed. It's our fault. :-( You can still subscribe to the feed if you know what it is. For reference, the error was:

      

TypeError: container has no properties

The sniffer shouldn't send this to the feed parser in the first place, so see bug 341040. However, the feed parser can cope with bogus input better.
SWAG?

result.doc can be null

This patch accounts for this in FP_sendResult, but you'll also need to handle this in FeedConverter.js. Is there a way to force text/xml processing in a new request?

There's also a sniffer bug here.

bug 341040
I think the friendly error message is nicer than showing the user the raw XML at first pass, but we should probably have some way for the user to get to that source. For example, adding a "See the contents of the file ..." link to the bottom of the error message which then loads the raw file.

Or just telling them about view source, but then I guess they don't get the expand/collapse controls.

r=me, guessing Ben's probably overloaded since this has sat for a long time.
Robert, can you file a separate bug on the front end portion and resolve this?
