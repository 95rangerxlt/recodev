I selected "Custom runtime" and then pressed "enter" quasi accidentally, but then the play / stop / pause buttons disappear and I get a loader for a (long) while -- about 20+ seconds? I haven't looked at the exact value in the settings.

I thought that Web IDE was done and I would have to restart it since it looks like it just was on its way to freezing up, and there was no 'cancel' button or anything that lets me see that something is going on, and that I can stop it if I want.

It should stop after 30s. But still - we should indeed have a cancel button, or something...
Jen, this looks like a good bug to check out to learn about the WebIDE code base.

Let me know if you have any questions about it.
After talking to Ryan about this, it doesn't really make sense to have a cancel button to stop a process that is already happening in the background with something like the Simulator.

Since installation of apps onto a device go through a progress indicator, which resets the timer at each interval, it sounds like reducing the error timeout from 30 seconds to something like 6 seconds is good enough for now.

WebIDE seems to hang / no way to stop an attempted connection to a remote runtime
