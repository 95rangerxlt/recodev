I have my colors set to white on black.  In the "show cookies" window,
the list of cookies respects this, but the individual cookie contents are
displayed in unreadable white on light grey, even though I unchecked
"allow web pages to use their own colors."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set colors to white text on black background.
2. Tools>Options>Privacy>Show Cookies.
3. Select any cookie.
Actual Results:  
Cookie components are shown in white on almost-white grey.

Expected Results:  
White on black.

patch

So this kills the different-colored background on the non-selectable grid on the left of the box. I don't know how we can hard-code a color on it and still be high-contrast friendly.

it's been the better part of a year, why isnt the patch in the release yet?  i mean, come on, this is slower than microsoft patches internet explorer!
suggest asking mano or gavin for review here.
then what the hell is the point of this bug tracker if bugs dont get fixed here?!

updated patch

Updated to current trunk. No need to explicitly specify dialog colors on the box, as far as I can tell - they're the default. Need help testing this on Linux.
