Rebert to 11a25fc022ba in local build, then the problem does not happen.
Landing a patch of Bug 528884 causes the problem.
In adittion to comment#0
This happens chevron's popup also.
Created attachment 452724
patch v1.0

There are also a couple fixes for js and cpp warning that I saw during the test.
