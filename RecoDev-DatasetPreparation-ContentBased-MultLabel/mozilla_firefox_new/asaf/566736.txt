Looks like this will break http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/viewsource/content/viewSource.js#391 . I guess you should fix it to just use browserBottomBox.insertBefore as you do for the findbar. It would be nice to ensure there's a test that would catch that bustage, too.

XPCOMUtils.defineLazyGetter(window, "gFindBar", function(){}) would be slightly simpler (don't need to delete yourself).

I think this is a bit easier to read as:

let openerFindbar = opener.gFindBarInitialized && opener.gFindBar;
(or openerFindbar = opener.gFindBarInitialized ? opener.gFindBar : null)
if (openerFindbar && !openerFindbar.hidden &&
    openerFindbar.findMode == openerFindbar.FIND_NORMAL)

r=me with those addressed.

Backed out due to a11y test failures.
The first part of comment 3 also wasn't addressed.
The test in question is:

For checkin - another attempt

I filed bug 566849 for fixing view-source the right way.

I think this broke test_name_nsRootAcc.xul on Windows:
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1274273683.1274274700.8647.gz
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1274273351.1274275486.12162.gz

Probably because the test fiddles with gFindBar:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/accessible/tests/mochitest/name_nsRootAcc_wnd.xul#35

Can you either fix the test or back out?

Actually this line was landed as part of this bug:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6fc5d661ca55#l1.8
Ah. Well, then, whatever it's trying to do is clearly failing on Windows, because that test failed on both the opt and debug test runs.
I backed this patch out to make the tree green again.

Sorry everyone, and thanks. On that now.

Last round for now.

Watching closely.
