When selecting 'Bookmark This Link' from the context menu, no dialog appears. Instead, the bookmark is just put on the end of the Bookmarks Menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load any page
2. Bring up the context menu for a link
3. Click 'Bookmark This Link'
Actual Results:  
No dialog is displayed to indicate that the bookmark was added or to allow editing. The bookmark appears at the end of the Bookmarks Menu.

Expected Results:  
'Page Bookmarked' dialog should be shown.

Confirmed.  Everything should be consistent.
If nothing else at least put the new bookmark in the unfiled bookmarks folder like clicking on the star does.  
I think the minimum correct behavior would be to show the new 'Page Bookmarked' dialog. Ideally, it should show a similar dialog, but labeled 'Link Bookmarked', and displayed centered rather than under the star.

I'm not understanding your regression range.  Can you post,
Works In: 
Broken In:

Thanks
Ah, OK, sorry. Thing is, it was showing two broken behaviors.

Works In: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre)
Gecko/200801291924 Minefield/3.0b3pre ID:200801291924

Broken In: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre)
Gecko/200801292251 Minefield/3.0b3pre ID:200801292251

But the in-between builds, 200801292038 and 200801292215, don't add a bookmark
at all for 'Bookmark This Link'. Perhaps due to Bug 414776?

*** Bug 414878 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Yeah bookmarking was completely broken in those 2038 and 2215 builds so, we can't for certain say which bug caused this bug I'd put my money on bug 393509.

VERIFIED
Not fixed on Linux.
running:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090313 Minefield/3.2a1pre

The bookmark this page panel is never displayed, the error in the console says:

Error: elt is null
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 5834

Strange, as this is fixed in 3.1b3.
Never mind. after a full rebuild of my checkout, this is fixed. My checkout was borked (again).
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
