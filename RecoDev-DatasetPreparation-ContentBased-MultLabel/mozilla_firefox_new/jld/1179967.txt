“Save As” with the “Text File” option (currently non-e10s-only), or more generally nsIWebBrowserPersist::SaveDocument with a null data path, will side-effect the document to add a <base> element rather than use the code it already has to convert links to absolute.  This is a strange behavior, and it would be nice if I didn't have to maintain it in bug 1101100 (and I'd also like to keep that bug as close to “no functional change intended” as feasible).

Looking at nsWebBrowserPersist::SetDocumentBase(), it can also create a <head>. Blame shows that this is crusty old pre-Hg code, so if we've got a better way to do the same thing, it would make sense to use it. Modifying the document when saving is pretty sucky. :(
git-blame tells me that this particular code goes all the way back to bug 46574, for reference.

I'm at a loss for picking a reviewer, but the Embedding module has people associated with it, so let's start there.

Yes, this stuff goes way way back... r=jst
Thanks for the review.

For checkin-needed, there's a Try run in comment #3 but also I forgot I'd done that one and did another: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=620a90bf01d4

Save As (nsWebBrowserPersist) shouldn't modify the document



Bug 1179967 - Always rewrite links to absolute in nsWebBrowserPersist instead of side-effecting document. r=jst
