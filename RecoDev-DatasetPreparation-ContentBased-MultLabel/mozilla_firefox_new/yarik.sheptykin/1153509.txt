Clipping translation bar on small screens

Hi everybody!

With this patch the translationbar is clipped when the screen is too small for its contents. This is obviously not the best solution but it allows the toolbar to behave normally.

What do you think?

After applying the patch translationbar behaves as this screenshot demonstrates.

We will still need to work on a better solution in bug 1008224, but this seems a very reasonable first step, thanks!

Thanks for the feedback, Florian! I updated the patch. Does it suffice for fixing this bug? Or should I work on a more sophisticated solution and a test for this scenario? I would rather put effort into Bug 1008224.
