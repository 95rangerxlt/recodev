Here's the report:

"The customize toolbars option does not allow you to cancel the operation. I
clicked on a button (Restore Default Set) which removed buttons from my toolbar
(File, Previous, Next). I wasn't able to cancel my way out of the operation nor
was I able to undo the operation."

even if firebird doesn't want it, I have to add it for a customer to
thunderbird. Re-opening to keep my m4 list straight.

the fix 

note: after discussing this with ben, we aren't turning this on for OSX because
then the toolbar dialog won't look right as on OSX window. 

Note 2: this fix is thunderbird specific and does not show up in firebird.
fixed
I'm guessing by Firebird you mean Firefox? Anyway, can we tweak this to Firefox
as well??? Our bug creation was wrongly marked WONT FIX: <a
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174957">174957</a>

If it was marked resloved/fixed, please excuse this. But as of the 12th, it is not.


Need ability to cancel from Customize Toolbars menu
