I need to bump the app version strings to 1.5 on the branch at a suitable time.

Also need to remove all of the hard coded beta 2 labels.

Ref: Bug 310615 to see what we did for beta 2.

I thought RC1 was going to be 1.4.2 and not 1.5 (at least that's what I had
heard from some)...
RC is intended to be the first Release Candidate, if no new issues arrive, it
would be released as Firefox 1.5. So the app version has to already be set to
1.5 before we release RC1
Oh I was the one that started that false rumor about 1.4.2 in my first comment
in 310615 but I was wrong.
Actually,
http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2005/08/16/extension-version-changes/
says 1.4.1 for RC1 (which was before b2 was added which took 1.4.1 and in theory
moved RC1 to 1.4.2. 

"Release candidate(s) will check for version 1.4.1 (and 1.4.2 if necessary). The
final release of Firefox and Thunderbird 1.5 will check for extension
compatibility with version 1.5."
We should do this sooner rather than later.
Note to Self: Benjamin reminded me that we need to coordinate this change with
the AMO build automation.

And I'm standing by to make the AUS changes.

firefox changes

I've verified these changes with official branding and a aself built installer.


The one thing I'm not sure about here is the installer string change. This
reverts us back to the pre-beta installer where the first screen says:

"You are about to install Mozilla Firefox."

We had been hard coding extra text at the end so you know what version you were
really installing:

"You are about to install Mozilla Firefox 1.5."

We may actually want to show the version string in this sentence.

We could leave the 1.5 hard coded string in installer.inc. If we tried to use
variable substitution on the string, we would have l10n impact. I'll let ben
and others figure out what they want for this installer string here.
