Trivial theme patch

Yet another HCI nazi-ism from none other than myself; when in fullscreen mode the main toolbar should not have top padding. Otherwise, the buttons are far too small to easily target. Putting them on the top edge solves these targetting issues and makes the bar conform to Fitts' Law more carefully.
