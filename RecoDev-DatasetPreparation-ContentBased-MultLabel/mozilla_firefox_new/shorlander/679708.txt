Update Lion Glyphs - 01 WIP

To further Lion-ize the toolbar icons:

* Update style: lighter gradient and stronger inner shadow
* Update Library icons and tabstrip icons
* Disabled icons should be 60% opacity

* Inactive window:
  - Icons should be 60% opacity
  - Disabled icons should be 30% opacity
  - Have a hover 100% opacity hover state

The attached WIP patch updates the images but I am not sure if there is a way to make Lion specific CSS rules for the inactive window state?

Not yet. I'll write a patch that adds :-moz-system-metric(mac-lion-theme).
Also, have you piped the images through an optimizer like ImageOptim?

Yes, I used ImageOptim.

Updated patch using -moz-mac-lion-theme for disabled and inactive-window rules. Also removed bookmarks and history checked hover:active state since it isn't used anymore

The disabled state seems quite subtle (significantly more subtle than on Windows until recently, where people already complained). I guess I can only blame Apple for this?

It is pretty subtle. The push towards less contrasty icons in Lion makes the available range for disabled more narrow.

We don't have to conform exactly however I don't think it will be confusing in the context of Lion. It is more obvious in use than in a screenshot.

Pushing the opacity down to .5 would make it more obvious and probably wouldn't look out of place.

Ok, I think we should use 50% opacity for the disabled state, or really any other value that gets us closer to 40% without alienating die-hard OS X enthusiasts.

I changed the opacity to .5 here which is a small but noticeable improvement.
