This issue started when i updated to the 2003-03-09 build; when i try to
bookmark a page, none of the information (title, url) of the page is being
saved, instead i get a empty bookmark named 'undefined'. All of my old bookmarks
work fine though, and when i edit the bookmark data manually, it works just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark any page of choice

Actual Results:  
I end up with an empty bookmark named 'undefined'

Expected Results:  
Created a bookmark with appropriate name, pointing at desired url.

I have not changed my config/themes/extensions recentley before the occurance of
this bug. I use default theme, tabbrowser extension, all-in-one gestures and
open- link-in extension.
