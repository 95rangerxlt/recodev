pageinfo.js and xul still try to expose help, likely leftovers from the suite version of it.
But the help pages don't exist, and pressing F1 just errors, as pageinfo.xul doesn't pull contextHelp.js.

We should either make help in page info work again (nah, not really) or just remove the traces, that is, the cmd in pageinfo.xul and doHelpButton in pageinfo.js.

This bug, bug 339102, and bug 314211 should probably be coordinated so they are all in agreement.  
The help page still doesn't exist but that should be fixed in bug 314221.
Now that bug 339102 is fixed, pageInfo.xul pulls contextHelp.js and doHelpButton is nearly correct.
A line for the security panel is missing in helpTopics though. I will attach a patch here for that if it doesn't get fixed in bug 377076.
