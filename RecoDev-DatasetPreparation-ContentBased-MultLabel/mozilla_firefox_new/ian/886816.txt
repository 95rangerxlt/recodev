I've noticed that the share icon is empty on retina displays, this will need to uplift all the way :(

Boriss, also need @2 images for share

Workaround

The problem is that:
423 @media (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
424   /* Whitelist built-in buttons, instead of .toolbarbutton-1,
425      to avoid potentially breaking add-on toolbar buttons. */
426   :-moz-any(@primaryToolbarButtons@):not(#tabview-button) {
427     list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/Toolbar@2x.png");
428   }
at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#427 overrides:
1693 #social-share-button {
1694   list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/social/share-button.png");
1695 }
from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#1693

The attached patch is a trivial workaround that we should take if we need something very low-risk very quickly.

A better solution would be to include an @2x icon for the Share button.

And the real fix is bug 874773.
@Boriss, do we have 2x icons for share?
Dupe of bug 875212?

Looks like, duped it the other way though since this bug has a patch.

OSX retina paper plane icons with states default, focused, pressed, toggled, and inactive

Patch v2

This new patch includes 2 icons from attachment 780111.

Unfortunately the icons in this attachment are 33x33px and I needed icons at twice the size of the current icons which are at the surprising size of 13x14px. I took the 33x33px icons and scaled them down to 28x28px with GIMP, and finally cut 2 columns of transparent pixels on the right size of the image to obtain 26x28px images that I could use. I assume icons made directly at the right size may look slightly better, but I honestly can't spot any visible issue with the icons I resized, so I'm going to assume they are good enough.

The !important in the CSS code are to override the rules at http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/2983ca6d4d1a/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#l418
I don't really like putting !important keywords, but the only other solution I see is what I did in attachment 767864, which IMHO is uglier.

So it seems to me that we need these !important overrides because #social-share-button is in primaryToolbarButtons.

Why is #social-share-button in primaryToolbarButtons? Does it really need to be there? What advantage does that give us?
I can't think of a good reason for the social-share-button to be in primaryToolbarButtons. Am I missing something?
