I was trying one of the installation smoketests which involes removing the Firefox folder from Application Support, which removes the profile, and relaunching the application to see whether the Migration Wizard comes up and prompts you to migrated from Safari or another browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the UB from the source above and install it.
2. Launch one first time and quit.
3. Remove the folder Application Support/Firefox from the current user's folder
4. Re-Launch Firefox

Actual Results:  
It just loads a default profile and the migration wizard never shows up.

Expected Results:  
Upon launch Migration Wizard should appear prompting you to migrate data (bookmarks, feeds, etc..) from Safari or any other browser you have installed.

I tried it on new macbook pro and iMac. On the iMac I also tried the latest version from the website 1.5.0.2, and a smilar thing happened.

Fix migration issues on osx

This patch ensures that Safari and MacIE are detected as profiles to migrate on OSX if other (firefox/netscape/opera) browsers aren't installed. It also ensures that future profile migration code gets hooked in properly, assuming the writers of such code read the comments.

Please get this landed and verified on trunk before requesting branch approval
Verified FIXED using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060622 Minefield/3.0a1. 

After moving the Firefox folder in ~/Library/Application support away and launching Firefox the migration wizard does indeed show.

Fix migration issues on osx

If the user does not have a phoenix, seamonkey, or opera profile already installed, the profile migrator will not show even if there is a Safari (most common case, probably) or a MacIE profile. This is a fairly simple and safe patch, and very important for a good number of people trying Firefox on OSX.
iSpiked you can mark Verified Fixed.
