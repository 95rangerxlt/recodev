Rename 'Memory' to 'Allocations' in the new performance tool

Review of attachment 8575656:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe we should rename the display option for "Enable Memory" as well, unless that is a name we'd use for the memory tool for the same pref.

That also enables a general memory usage graph, so it is more than just allocations. Although I think we should replace that graph with an allocations heat map.
Note that this only changes some strings, doesn't mess with code, so I don't think I should need a try push for checkin-needed, right?
