What do you mean by "strange"? Does this bug reply only pertain to the Firefox Button?

After drag and drop bookmark within the bookmark popup of Firefox Button,the dropped bookmark appears wrong position.
This problem happens due to adding items into placesView, after construction of _placesView (new PlacesMenu).

              <menupopup id="appmenuBookmarkMenu_popup"
                         placespopup="true"
                         context="placesContext"
                         openInTabs="children"
                         oncommand="BookmarksEventHandler.onCommand(event);"
                         onclick="BookmarksEventHandler.onClick(event);"
                         onpopupshowing="BookmarksMenuButton.onPopupShowing(event);
                                         if (!this.parentNode._placesView)new PlacesMenu(event, 'place:folder=BOOKMARKS_MENU');
>>                                      this.appendChild(document.getElementById('appmenuBookmarkMenu_unsorted_seperator'));
>>                                      this.appendChild(document.getElementById('appmenuBookmarkMenu_unsorted-menuitem'));"
                         tooltip="bhTooltip"
                         popupsinherittooltip="true">

Bug 592900 probably fixes this.
it's also possible there is a bug due to hiding bookmarks toolbar submenu and separator, but we should fix the other bug before (as dolske said, it was wrong in the first place to use appendChild that way) and than test for that.
As far as I can test everything seems to be working fine after the patch in bug 592900, please reopen if you see remaining issues.
