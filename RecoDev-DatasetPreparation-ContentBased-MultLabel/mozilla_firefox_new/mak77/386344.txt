remove transaction from nsNavHistory::GetQueryResults()

From http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavHistory.cpp#2156

// Put this in a transaction. Even though we are only reading, this will
// speed up the grouped queries to the annotation service for titles and
// full text searching.
mozStorageTransaction transaction(mDBConn, PR_FALSE);

That is from the original checking (v 1.1) but I don't think we are doing any grouped queries or searching the annotation service for titles in this code.

I would be curious to know how that sped things up before, as it might be a trick that we can use elsewhere.

If it is unnecessary now, we should remove it.

i'm doing this in patch for bug 364655
i meant bug 390614
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
