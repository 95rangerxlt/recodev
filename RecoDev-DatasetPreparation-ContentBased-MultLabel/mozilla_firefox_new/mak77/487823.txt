Two out of the past five Linux mozilla-central unit test cycles have been orange, with a hang/timeout (1200 seconds without output) in mochitest-browser-chrome.

Both of these oranges have output like the following:

I'm filing this bug in the Places component, because the "can move shortcut node?" text (before the timeout/hang) is from browser/components/places/tests/browser/browser_423515.js

The failure logs are:

if that can help, also other crashes and issues stop there, even if i never found a direct relation with that specific test.

invalid new default button: , assuming: none
this is relative to bookmarksProperties.xul, could be an hang on browser_bookmarksProperties.js... that could happen if we lose focus.
taking, i want to try if i can remove all focus requirements from the above test.

This should make the test a bit more solid since i've removed some focus and systhesize call, but mainly will detect situations where we could hang due to focus issues, and annotates every focus call with a dump to easily find the point where we hang in case it should still happen due to this test.

still something to fix, and adw reported an hang (he also said old version was not hanging for him).
Btw, needs new patch.

That's interesting.  ok(true, str) is basically a dump statement formatted like a test result, isn't it?

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
