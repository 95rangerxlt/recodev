Due to the tracked regressions the locationbar is not very usable in Nightly, we are going to disable unified until these tracked regressions are handled.

We prefer doing this rather than a backout cause most of the unified complete project is blocked by the fixes causing these regressions, and backing those out would have a large cost (easy bitrotting, hard to work on top of long queue of patches, other dependencies...)

Marco please add this to the current iteration

follow-up because of bug 1090913 that would have disallowed us to safely merge to Aurora too (it will be lot of fun), plus Bug 1104755 (test timeout), plus browser_autocomplete_autoselect.js not being skipped when unified is disabled, plus browser_urlbarAutoFillTrimURLs.js being wrong when unified is disabled

I hope now central will be green and we can merge to Aurora...
