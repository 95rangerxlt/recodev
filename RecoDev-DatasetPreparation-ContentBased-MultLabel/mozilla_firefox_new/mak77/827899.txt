Tab Overlapping Arrow Animation

If the selected tab is near the download button the download complete animation appears under the selected tab. I have only tested this on OSX.
plausible code points involved:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser.css#2386
probably gnomestripe has similar problem
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/gnomestripe/global/tabbox.css#52
So stephen confirmed the problem is that z-index, unfortunately it's not enough to just define z-index and position on the notification since looks like they pertain to different stacking contexts.
I still have to test gnomestripe.
setting z-index and position on #downloads-indicator-anchor appears to fix the problem.
And gnomestripe doesn't appear to be affected.

In some circumstances, this issue is still reproducible:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/complete-themes/
2. Install FXChrome theme and restart.
3. Open several tabs so that the last opened one is near the downloads indicator
4. Perform any download.

Actual results:
If the selected tab is near the download button the download complete animation appears under the selected tab.

Please see the screencast for more details:

So far I reproduced this issue only with FXChrome theme installed (no other theme that I installed showed this behavior). 

Marco, would you prefer me to reopen this bug or file a new one?
Unfortunately we cannot fix third party themes, so I don't think it's worth a bug

Verified on Firefox 20 beta 1 that with the default theme, the selected tab does not overlap the finished download animation. Based on this and on Comment 13, setting the tracking flag for Firefox 20 to Verified.
