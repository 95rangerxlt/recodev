Connor suggested to set name="q" on the search field in about:home to reuse old autocomplete data. Losing that data is indeed a regression from what we have in FX3.6

While we investigate bug 612453 (making decent and sexy autocomplete code could not be that trivial) this sounds like a really simple fix that could make the release.

asking softblocking because sounds like a simple, safe and sensible thing to do if we can't make a good suggest code in time.
Doesn't block, but if it's that simple, a patch would be approved.

Trying to split up the reviews burden, mconnor suggested this and I think he can review (And eveventually approve?) it :)
Asking approval at the same time since the patch is trivial.
