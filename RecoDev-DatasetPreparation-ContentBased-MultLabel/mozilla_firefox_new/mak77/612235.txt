I get no reaction from "Forget about this site", if triggered from Library's context menu. More, after calling this feature, the applet containing history list is blocked. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open History > Show All History from the main menu.
2.Right click and chose "Forget about this site" for an entry.
Actual Results:  
No entry is deleted and the Library window locks.

Expected Results:  
All the related pages of that site should be deleted and you could navigate through the remained pages with no problem.

Note: tested only against win7. regression range wanted?

taking for investigation.
probably a blocker if the Library hangs.
I also found that Library > Bookmarks can be blocked if chose "Forget about this site" for an item from Bookmarks Toolbar > Most Visited.

patch v1.0

This fixes both the above issues for me, it was nested batches calls.

Before going to central I'll push to try just to check that my assertion is safely handled (it should be much better than the old bogus warning).
fwiw, it's not really a hang, it's just that we stop handling selection events!
I believe this is in litmus (test case 11225).
the NS_ABORT is still hitting a case in browser_library_left_pane_commands.js I'll try to debug it.

patch v1.1

I'm removing the abort because it is triggering in absolutely common and valid situations. Tracking all batching levels from the source would require much deeper changes that are not worth the gain (that would just be having a correct abort) now.

if that's the case that must be a new bug, so please file a new bug including steps to reproduce starting from a clean profile.
