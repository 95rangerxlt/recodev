When you open the bookmarks menu button, and then hover over the button or menu, it show the hover appearance instead of the depressed appearance that it should have.  This is because the hover css rule is taking precedence over the open css rule.

The selector in question is:

.toolbarbutton-1:not([disabled="true"]):not([checked="true"]):not(:active):hover

It should be changed to:

.toolbarbutton-1:not([disabled="true"]):not([checked="true"]):not([open="true"]):not(:active):hover

This is in browser.css, line 357.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click bookmarks menu button
2. Hover over the button or menu
Actual Results:  
Hover appearance

Expected Results:  
Depressed appearance

this is probably the same as bug 574508, or its cause
Created attachment 454502
patch v1.0

yes it's the same, the flickering is due to the transition. Actually I tried to check if we wanted to just move out the transition but moving cursor in and out of the popup makes button look weird.
Gnomestripe does not have particular hover handlings.
Pinstripe does not have an hover styling on not(:active)
I quickly checked other rules and they look correct.

Thanks for pointing out both issue and location of the rule.
