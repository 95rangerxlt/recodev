I can still reproduce this issue on the latest Nightly and Aurora - the position of the downloads is still changed after Clearing the list from the panel. Moreover one of the downloads is deleted from the downloads view after clearing the list.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Open the downloads view
3. Perform 3 downloads 
4. Navigate to: http://bit.ly/159c6t5 and save the first image (save is as it is "index.jpeg")
5. Perform 3 more downloads.
6. Open the Panel, right click on any download and select Clear List.
7. Close the Library window and open it again.

Actual results:

After step 6:
- The downloads list gets reversed.
- The index.jpeg file is removed from the downloads view.
After step 7:
- The downloads list gets reversed again (the order of the downloads is the same as before step 6).
- The index.jpeg file is still missing from the downloads view.
Thank you Simona, everything was working when I tested it, but I surely missed some edge case here :(
I'm investigating your steps to reproduce now, will make a follow-up patch once I figure what's up.

> - The index.jpeg file is removed from the downloads view.

This is expected, cause this image is a data: uri, we don't store data: uris in history, since it is not in history, when it's removed from the downloads list it also disappears from the view.
Here you can find list of protocols we don't add to history:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/nsNavHistory.cpp#1256

Now investigating the order issue.
There is another edge case that I just found, due to a bug in toolkit we never add downloads history for 0-byte files, thus when you clear history they disappear cause we lack their history information.
I filed bug 840676 about that, I don't think we are going to fix it for Aurora considered it's a "minor" issue, but worth to mention it while I found it.

part 2 - the missing puzzle piece!

Those entries without any Places data were indeed confusing the code, by causing this._lastSessionDownloadElement to go out-of-sync.  Really good catch with that data uri!

Now doing final testing before asking review.

Yep - this makes sense. Good catch!

Simona, could you please verify this on tomorrow's (13) nightly, so we can uplift to Aurora a verified fix.
