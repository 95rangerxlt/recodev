STR:

1. Load about:home.
2. Look at the error console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Security error"  code: "1000" nsresult: "0x805303e8 (NS_ERROR_DOM_SECURITY_ERR)"  location: "chrome://browser/content/aboutHome.js Line: 144"]

Which is coming from here: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/aboutHome.js#144>.  This suggests that updating the snippets on this page is broken, and it indeed is (I don't see any snippets at all).  This should probably block.

Also, as far as I can see, this page was landed without tests, which, I think, is odd...

that should be fixed in today's nightly
Fixed by https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/84ee6bc0484d .

We should get a test that _some_ snippet appears (at least the default).
Either mark this fixed and file a followup for the test, or morph this into being about the test, please?
Morphed to cover the test.
I have a general test in bug 598264.
there is a test now, pushed with bug 598264.


Test to make sure that snippets appear in about:home
