STR please.
In the debugger, click on the Search box, type "!foo" , where foo is atleast in one of the non selected script.
Tried on many sites. I think it is in general not working. Debugger is not paused.
Latest Nightly, windows 7.
Can you *please* give me an example of a site?
Okay, no idea how it helps but:
1. Go to Facebook
2. open debugger
3. in the search box, type "!CavalryLogger"
4. Nothing happens, open error console, find the same error

global search on facebook

Global searches work for me on Facebook. Anything else in stdout?
Does this still happen with a clean profile?

The error in comment 0 is (mostly unrelated): it's a type error when we receive a aResponse.error while trying to load the source text. "aUrl" should be "aSource.url".

NOT WORKING

While it does work on this page (I tried !yahoo), it is still ot working on FB (see attachment) with this error in error console:

This should make global searching always work, but the underlying issue of some sources throwing response errors when trying to load their source still remains unexplained.
