This kind of feature should be "surface-agnostic". I should work with the 2D inspector as well.
I am thinking of using right click for this functionality. Something also tells me that this should have a key for doing this, although picking a node itself cannot be done with the keyboard. Since right click currently does nothing, I see three possibilities:

1. click to select, then right click (on the same node!) to delete
2. right click to automatically delete node under the cursor
3. click to select, press x, or accel+x to delete node

I like the the (2, 3) combination.

v1

Wip patch. No tests. Lot of queue underneath, probably not safe to apply.
Using right click to delete node may interfere with the current "right click + drag = panning around", although I personally don't find it a problem. Should we stick only to using a key to delete the currently selected node?

Try is green.

this deletes the node from the underlying DOM, does it not?

If the HTML panel is open, what happens? Haven't looked at the patch yet so if this is addressed, I applaud your comprehensiveness.

Also, I'm working on a patch to add similar functionality to bug 584407 (wip patch, have a local version that is more current) which you should be able to hook into if the HTML panel is present.

again, will review more fully after I've cleared out some earlier review requests.
These are only visual changes. This means that the underlying dom is unaltered, but elements are invisible in the 3D view and can't be picked (clicked) in the Tilt view, but maintain an outer shadow to let users know that *something was there*.
If a node in the breadcrumbs or html panel is selected, Tilt will show a highlight quad exactly over where the node used to be (this also means on the z axis).
getting an error that DOM_VK_X is undefined so I missed a patch in your queue while testing this. Strangely, I don't seem to be able to find that defined anywhere in the patch queue. I am taking this to mean that I am tired and unable to review more patches this evening!

Missed a patch :)

when is onSetupTexture not a function? When it's null? Appears only in the one place. Please to Explain!

word.

Codewise this is OK, but it's a little weird. It'd be nice if it wasn't quite so destructive.

Do we really want this?
I'm also not keen on the right click to destroy nodes control. What if I'm translating and mess it up?
I think this may be a useful way to help visually select nodes without having to resort to breadcrumbs and HTML view. It seems like an interesting feature to try.

I concur with Rob, though, regarding the right click. Perhaps UX can comment on the implementation?

I agree. See comment #2 and comment #4 (I asked).
Currently you can both delete nodes with right click, and by pressing X while a node is selected. We can stick only to keyboard interaction.

I definitely think we need this. I'll post an updated patch with only keyboard control.

There are two major setup steps in tilt: creating the texture and the mesh. I added a onSetupMesh function (needed by tests) and an onSetupTexture function (to "mirror" the previous one, but not currently needed, although I bet it will be needed really (!) soon). This is because the lack of expressive notifications currently in Tilt, but fixed by the patch in bug 718973.

What's destructive about this patch? The only "removed" thing is actually a merge between onClick and onMouseDown handlers. Other than that, it's 4 tests added and the deleteNode function :)

Removed the right-click-to-remove functionality.

Seems reasonable to me, but this is completely undiscoverable (unless the user bumps the 'x' key when trying to press 's' :)

Perhaps we need a bug on Tilt control discoverability in general. I'll look to see if we have one and file one if we don't.

I don't think we have one.
The extension had a help dialog. Maybe we can somehow steal the idea?
I think we should have a 3D view page on MDN as a bare minimum. Probably as a subset for all of the Page Inspector's documentation. Need a separate bug for that stuff.
Drive-by aside: I'd like to see the keyboard shortcut info HUD created (and be context based) which is bug 492557. Could be helpful if '?' becomes a user reflex.

v2.1

[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): New feature.
User impact if declined: Some nodes may obscure other nodes in the visualization.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): m-c
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): This patch does introduce a new keyboard control. It does change the contents of the visualization, but the underlying web page is unaffected by it. I believe it is low risk.
Documentation updated:
