Bug 1004104 landed, but it didn't seem to help much. However, as detailed in bug 989186, there is a single point of failure for virtually all netmonitor intermittent oranges:

> Network events progress: 1/m
> Network events progress: 2/m
...
> Network events progress: n/m (where n < m)
...
Hang.
...
Test abruptly fails.
Other tests following it fail because of that.

This has only started happening a few months ago; prior to that there weren't any consistent netmonitor failures. It's a bit late to bisect the actual cause now, but adding additional logging could help us figure this out.
