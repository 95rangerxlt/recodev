I noticed while working on bug 1017790.

Since profile entries are never destroyed, whatever flags were set before stick around when frames are re-pushed onto the stack. We're doing the necessary work to handle IS_CPP_ENTRY and FRAME_LABEL_COPY, but previous category flags stick around.

We should just throw away all the flags when setting new js/cpp frames, because the previous data is bound to be useless. We're actually doing this correctly IonMacroAssembler :)
