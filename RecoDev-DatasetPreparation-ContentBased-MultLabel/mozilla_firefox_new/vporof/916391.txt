If you look at a log after bug 876277 landed, the log for this test looks like this:

Conspicuously missing is any mention of "Tab1 should be gone." or "The original tab is selected."

I assume this happens because the test got rejiggered like so:

      .then(testRemoveTab)
      .then(closeConnection)
      .then(finish)

but testRemoveTab kicks off a new async operation (listTabs)... but nothing now waits for this operation to complete.  I assume it should return a promise that's resolved when the operation completes?

Victor, this is blocking bug 874502 because the fix I had for this test before doesn't work in the new setup and the right fix will depend on how this bug gets fixed...  Please let me know ASAP if you won't be able to fix this quickly: that bug is blocking workers DOM work that people are really antsy to get landed.
Oh, and the point is that if you don't have time for this I can take a stab at it.

You're right. This is an easy fix.
