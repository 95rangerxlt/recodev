Until something much better like bug 859133 lands, it'd be nice if the only currently available thing didn't completely such. Take a look at the screenshots to see what happens when you actually try to click/select the header values in the network monitor sidepane.

Victor, I applied the patch but I dont know what to expect. From the bug description I would expect to be allowed to select headers in netmonitor, but I still cant do that with this patch. Am I missing something?

Mihai, see how the text used to get chopped off after clicking on headers and an input is created? That + loss of context made text selection hard. Let me know if you can think of a better description for this bug.

I had to back this out (along with the other patches in that push) in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/b1b18a46eda2 for causing browser-chrome-1 tests to start leaking by adding tests, which pushed other tests into a different chunk, making them leak.

All of this is insane :(
The patch in this bug doesn't have tests, so the reasoning that it can cause bc-1 tests to start leading by "adding tests" is false.

Relanded: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/dcc436df9d67

Headers values in the netmonitor sidepane are very hard to read and copy after clicking on them



Bug 991175 - Headers values in the netmonitor sidepane are very hard to read and copy after clicking on them, r=msucan 

Backed out changeset 312c314e230b (bug 991175) for pushing tests around, causing chunked browser-chrome bustage on a CLOSED TREE 

Relanding bug 991175 as a backout of changeset b1b18a46eda2 because it has no tests and can't cause browser-chrome bustage, r=me
