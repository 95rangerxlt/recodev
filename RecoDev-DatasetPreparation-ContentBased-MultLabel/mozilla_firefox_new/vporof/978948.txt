We should do something about these ancient ways of animating things. At the very least, displaying a huge red flashing banner PLEASE DON'T USE SETINTERVAL FOR ANIMATION should do the trick :)

doesn't have to be flashing. A red notification would work though.

Shelving a very wip patch.
*** Bug 1040883 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Do we have any intention of supporting this, especially once we make clear that it's recording a rAF frame (bug 985488)? Can also provide an even more explicit explanation of "Don't use setTimeout/setInterval *link*"
I'd like us to support it. There's a lot of demos on the internet that *STILL* use setInterval. However, we should make it absolutely clear that it's a Bad Thing and the developers should feel Bad.
Gonna take a look at this.

As per discussion in IRC, changing this to only support setTimeout at this time, as it'll be more common than setInterval due to the popular rAF shim[0]that uses it, and similarities it shares to rAF in function signature.

This'll need to be rebased hard with the other canvas debugger patches. A few things are built out, as if the rAF/setTimeout paths are different, but those can be merged all into one ANIMATION_GENERATOR array, as their implementations are identical, just a matter of taste splitting them up in the actor.

Update the comment for recordAnimationFrame too
