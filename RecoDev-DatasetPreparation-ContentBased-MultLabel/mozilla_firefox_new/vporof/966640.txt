The splitter color change looks good, but I'm not sure if there is a reason why the selectionTextColor variable has been removed

Is there a reason why this variable has been removed and replaced with the color in 4 places here?

It's inconsistently used in that particular widget, at least. This "light foreground text" color is used both as @smw_selectionTextColor@ and as #f5f7fa. We should just pick one. Since we're using standard colors now from the wiki, I thought I'd remove it and follow what every other css file does.

I can do this in a different bug if you want, or in a different way.

That's fine.  We are going to have to do a big find/replace at some point anyway when we switch to CSS variables or switch to new theme colors, so I don't really mind having duplicated colors around as long as they are used consistently
