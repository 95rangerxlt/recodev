So, 'window' and 'this' are never re-expanded, because performance. However, I found a few really weird cases in which the nodes get re-expanded only after hovering them!

STR:
1. Go to http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/ and open debugger
2. Add breakpoint on line 31 of app-view.js
3. Reload and wait for breakpoint to be hit
4. Expand the middle function scope
5. Step in

The function scope should've been re-expanded. It's not. If you hover it, it gets re-expanded. Weird.

Copy paste leftover. I'll remove it.
