I accidentally modified the filter preferences to have a bogus predicate. This made the netmonitor unable to use filters at all. We should properly sanitize this.

np, yeah will do!

also had to back this change out, seems it caused a leak like https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=36728854&tree=Fx-Team
That can't be caused by this patch... Please re-land this.
Please also add the back-out changeset in the future, it's easier to track things down: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/a26977bf2252
Tentative reland: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/513e425d0268
Hopefully this proves not to be the actual source of oranges.
I've been looking into comment 5 some more, and I found something that might *potentially* be a cause for oranges.

Because of the way we lazily populate the requests menu, a timeout could fire after the test finishes, which just results in an exception being thrown. This looks harmless, but it should definitely not happen.

Although there are so many other tests that already suffer from this problem, I've fixed this, just in case it might actually be the thing that's causing things to fail at the end of the suite: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/7f4778b94aa8

Bug 987310 - Tentatively relanded, as a backout of changeset a26977bf2252, a possibly incorrect assumption that it caused orange in bc2 linux tests, r=me 

Bug 987310 - Make sure the RequestsMenu is not lazily updated, to avoid a "JavaScript Error: 'aValue.content is undefined'" error being thrown after the test finishes, r=me
