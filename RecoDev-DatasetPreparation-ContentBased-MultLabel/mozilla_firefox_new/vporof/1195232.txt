It's just an enum, with some fields we don't even need. There's no reason to include/reuse it everywhere.

The patch overall looks good.  However I am going to r- it for now because it is missing a crucial file.

From the way the code is written I'm going to guess that the new enum is not an "enum class".  I think the class form is generally preferable in new code because it introduces a new name space and thus avoids possible name clashes.  So I would recommend this; though unfortunately it means another pass through all the files.  Another equivalent approach would be to make the non-class enum a member of TimelineMarker.

Also, could you see if nsDocShell.h can now drop the GeckoProfiler.h include?  I vaguely recall that the enum was the only reason for this, but I'm not certain.
