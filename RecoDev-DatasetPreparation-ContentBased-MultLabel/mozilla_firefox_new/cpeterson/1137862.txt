Should we have an "About Shumway" entry? If so, where would that lead? Should we remove existing entries from the menu? (Probably not.)

Should we have a "Fall back to Flash" entry?

We need UX support for this, probably.

Oh, and should we have a "report problems" entry? We currently do, but it leads to a pre-filled bugzilla bug form, which would probably not be what we want for release.
We will remove all Shumway context menu items (in release mode) in bug 1177027.


Define context menu entries and their behavior
