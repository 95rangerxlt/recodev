When in DOM full screen mode, there should be a context menu entry to exit full screen.
The changes should be made in /browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js and the unit test at /browser/base/content/test/test_contextmenu.html will need to be updated as well.
The JS can check for |document.mozFullScreenElement != null| to know if the browser has entered Full Screen.
Where do you think the most appropriate place for this context menu is? I think it makes the most sense in the navigationItems (appx line 199 of nsContextMenu.js), something like "Exit full screen mode". Or, would it make sense to give it it's own section in the context menu?

It probably deserves its own section. Switching between full screen and non-full screen doesn't seem like a navigation event to me.
That makes sense to me!

So, I added the following function to nsContextMenu.js's nsContextMenu prototype (http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1386268).  I've also added a test (http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1386267).

I think the next step for me is to go in to the XUL and define the context-closeFullScreen item, and then also add that string in the dtd file. I've built the nightly (I'm on OS X.7), but when I grep or ack for the strings I see in a context menu (i.e. "View Background Image"), it shows a bunch of dtd files - not sure if I have to edit one or all? As far as the XUL goes, for this specific patch, I will be adjusting toolkit/components/help/content/helpContextOverlay.xul, correct? Also, I saw there's one for the En-US locale - when do the translators come into the process? Would I have to make a request that someone who knows other languages see this patch, or how would I go about fixing that problem as well? 

Lots of questions. Sorry to put them all in one post, but I figured people would rather get one email than three! Thank you for your help!

Can you please add these changes as attachments to this patch. The easiest way to export your changes is to do:
hg diff > name_of_file.diff

You can then upload that diff file to this bug as an attachment, then we can track changes as the work progresses.

String updates are done in the DTD files, and we generally only update the en-US locale. Our localizers will see the new strings and update them during the Aurora phase of our development lifecycle. With that being said, we probably won't need to add new strings for this patch.

I think we can reuse the string that is defined for browser full screen mode. See this search on MXR:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=fullscreenexit&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central

As you can see in the search that I have linked to, the context menu is added in /browser/base/content/browser.xul

Maybe this should follow the same convention as other parts of this file and add a property to |this| such as |this.isFullScreenMode| (I'm not sure if I like the *Mode name, but that can be decided later).
yup - nice catch with the typos :) 

i added the property to |this| after adding the patch, so was thinking the same thing! digging into it last night helped a lot - it's much clearer now how all of the XUL and DTD stuff ties together.

i'm busy driving about 16 hours in the next two days, but will absolutely finish this up once i get home.

updated progress of context menu

for some reason or another, when building after this code, nothing is showing up in the context menu when the browser goes into html5 full-screen mode. not sure why - it must not be getting initialized, because (as you can see), i've tried manually setting the boolean shouldShow to true, and it's still not even showing the static text "firefox is awesome" there.

Any ideas?

Sorry for the confusion, I forgot to mention that the <menuitem> will have to be added to browser/base/content/browser-context.inc

Also, for a quicker build you should be able to do |make -s -C browser/base && make -s -C browser/app|

Manually tested this against this site (http://pearce.org.nz/full-screen/). Click the button to toggle into full-screen mode, and the context menu will then have an option to "Exit Full Screen Mode", which works correctly.

"v" is already taken:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=%22v%22&find=browser.dtd&findi=&filter=accesskey&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central

However, given the different context menu variants, it may be impossible to find a better key. This means that users may need to hit V twice in order to get to the desired item.
What are the next steps I have to complete for this bug to be committed? Dão, correct me if I'm wrong, but do I see that you flagged it for ui review? 

I'm just unfamiliar with the process! Thank you!
The patch is waiting for limi to sign off on this from a UX perspective. Once the ui-review is granted, just add the checkin-needed keyword.
Comment on attachment 577472
Add accesskey

It would be great to have a screenshot or a tryserver build for UI-review, but as far as I can tell from reading the diff, this just adds a context menu item once you have entered fullscreen that exits fullscreen mode — and that seems perfectly reasonable to me.

I'd check with Matej on the wording of this, Mac OS X uses "Enter Full Screen" and "Exit Full Screen", which makes sense to me — I'm not sure that the word "mode" adds anything meaningful here. Also, "enter/exit" vs "leave", and I believe we might call it "fullscreen" officially now instead of fullscreen.

Overall, this looks good to me.

Yes, according to bug 705234 we are going with "fullscreen".
Great. I'll change it to say "Exit Fullscreen".

I think we should just keep the menuseparator id the same as it was before, 'context-media-sep-commands'.

* "v" doesn't make sense, since you changed Leave to Exit.

* You shouldn't write "Fullscreen" as one word in the label, as this is inconsistent with our other strings. Bug 705234 deals with changing this, doing it for a single label only doesn't help.

I'm not sure what there is to explain - it sounds fine to me. "fullscreen" is a made-up computer term to begin with, and it generally describes the mode, so there's no need explicitly mention "mode".

I'm looking for something like <http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fullscreen>.

It generally describes a mode, okay. That doesn't automatically make it a noun. "Go fullscreen" (adjective) also sounds more sensible than "enter fullscreen" (noun) to me...
Seems like we should be discussing this in bug 705234, but...

"go fullscreen", "exit fullscreen", and "enter fullscreen" all seem equally sensible to me. Even more importantly, none of them are ambiguous. Our goals for the UI are to be clear and consistent, and I think any of those strings can achieve that, regardless of whether you understand their grammatical structure.
Me understanding the grammatical structure isn't an end in itself. I just want to make sure what we put in front of millions of users makes sense grammatically (and is clear and consistent at the same time). Of course my feeling about a foreign language can be wrong, but what I find online seems to support it and nobody else seems to be able to explain the structure...
"makes sense grammatically" also isn't an end in itself. In this particular case, I don't think it correlates well with any of the metrics we care about.

(In reply to Gavin Sharp (use gavin@gavinsharp.com for email) from comment #45)
> "makes sense grammatically" also isn't an end in itself.

Of course it isn't. English grammar doesn't say that "full screen" must not act as a noun and that "exit" + adjective is forbidden because this is how things ought to be. It says that native speakers of the English language don't commonly talk like that -- or maybe it doesn't, which is why I asked.
So, to avoid a longer debate about the purpose of grammer, what I'm asking is: Will "exit fullscreen" feel natural to the masses? People are adaptive and tolerant towards jargon and quirky language, but that doesn't mean user interfaces shouldn't avoid it if they can.
(In reply to Dão Gottwald [:dao] from comment #49)
> Will "exit fullscreen" feel natural to the masses?

Yes, it will feel natural to the masses. It is a popular phrase with video online, and is the phrasing that YouTube uses to exit fullscreen (except they use "full screen", but that has already been decided).
AFAIK Flash says "Press Esc to exit full screen mode." Youtube's full screen button has a tooltip saying just "Full Screen" (no "Enter"), I think. (I get the German interface.)

Yes, that is the tooltip for entering fullscreen. When already in fullscreen, the tooltip says "Exit full screen".

To be consistent with the menu before entering fullscreen, the separator should be below the fullscreen menuitem. However, we shouldn't add an extra menuseparator.

Apart from "exit fs" vs. "exit fs mode", I said, quote: You shouldn't write "Fullscreen" as one word in the label, as this is inconsistent with our other strings. Bug 705234 deals with changing this, doing it for a single label only doesn't help.

Connor: Do you still have our conversation on what to do to fix this test?

Fixed testcase in Connor's patch

This patch includes the changes from Connor's patch, and updates his testcase to correctly launch fullscreen mode and launch the context menu.

I'm using netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege('UniversalXPConnect'); in two callbacks to get permission to the contextMenu. If there is a more-appropriate way of doing this (as far as I know, enablePrivilege is no longer recommended for new tests), please let me know.

What exceptions do you get when you don't call enablePrivilege?

I get "permission denied to access property 'state'" on line 30 of test_contextmenu.html
Instead of using enablePrivilege, you can change the throwing reference to |SpecialPowers.wrap(contextMenu).state|.

Replaced enablePrivilege use with SpecialPowers.wrap

Thanks for the help, jdm. SpecialPowers.wrap is working perfectly.

The line here for context-media-sep-commands needs to be changed. It is already shown/hidden in initMediaPlayerItems if the context menu is being shown on a media element. We shouldn't be hiding it here in case it was already made visible.

We should also remove this event listener when it is called like you've done for the entering fullscreen case.

Let's leave this string unchanged and get it fixed in bug 705234.

Almost there :) Can you set a commit message on the patch as well as the User information? See http://blog.bonardo.net/2010/06/22/so-youre-about-to-use-checkin-needed for more information.

Also, can you call SpecialPowers.clearUserPref("full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only"); before the test finishes (around line 773 of test_contextmenu.html) so that the pref state is cleaned up?

Looks good to me! I'll send this to tryserver and if all tests pass then I'll check it in for you :)

Thanks for the patch, Dan! I had to un-bitrot browser.dtd a bit. Please look it over to make sure it's OK.

Thanks for un-bitrotting it. I know you've already checked it in, but I wanted to confirm that your change looks fine!


When in DOM full screen mode, there should be a context menu entry to exit full screen
