Firefox's Single Window mode implemented in bug 172962 misbehaves a bit when
asked to open an invalid URL. If new windows are preffed to open into tabs,
Firefox will open that tab, and then a new window as well. See the attached
testcase for details.

No. No worse than it already was.

seems to be always correct in my testing.
