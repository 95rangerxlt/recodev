Happy to take this if no one else wants it.

Going to be on a transatlantic flight all day tomorrow, so I won't be able to post a patch for a day or so.
For local development, just look for manifest.json. No need for update.webapp
Status update: I've got the WebIDE part into good shape, but I'm having trouble debugging the webapps actor. Wish me luck on my flight :)

Initial patch to support packaged WebExtensions in WebIDE

Attached first draft of a patch.

I can't see anything missing from this patch, but for whatever reason, it's not working on my end.

What works:

1. Loading a WebExtension in the WebIDE
2. Pushing it to another device
3. application.zip and manifest.json appear in /data/local/webapps/{app-id}/
4. The "{app name} successfully installed" notification appears
5. The RDP chatter looks normal and reports that the package was installed
6. Entries for the add-on appear in /data/local/webapps/webapps.json

What doesn't work:

1. After pushing, the WebIDE reports "Operation timed out: installing and running app"
2. The add-on does not appear in Settings
3. The add-on is not applied to the system

Old-style add-ons installed via WebIDE and WebExtensions installed from https://people.mozilla.org/~fdesre/extensions/ work correctly, so something's missing from my patch.

Comparing Les Orchard's Brightness Slider installed via Fabrice's page and via the WebIDE, I see only two potentially meaningful differences in /data/local/webapps/webapps.json:

    "appStatus": 2,      // (1 when installed from WebIDE)
    "role": "addon",     // ("" when installed from WebIDE)

Other fields differ ("installerAppId", "installerIsBrowser"), but they all appear to be inconsequential metadata. Installing from the web also results in entries like "manifestHash", "packageHash", "downloadSize", and "updateManifest", which are not present when installed from the WebIDE. The WebIDE installation results in "sideloaded": true. The "sideloaded" key is not present when installing from the Web.

Help would be appreciated at this point. :)
Oh, hey! When I install the Brightness Slider from https://people.mozilla.org/~fdesre/extensions/, I end up with the following files in /data/local/webapps/{app-id}:

    application.zip
    manifest.webapp // <-- ???
    update.webapp

If I download application.zip, unpack it, and install it directly from the WebIDE, I get the following files in that location:

    application.zip
    manifest.json // <-- ???

When installed from the web, the contents of manifest.webapp are:

    {
      "type": "privileged",
      "name": "Brightness slider!",
      "role": "addon",
      "developer": {
        "name": "Les Orchard"
      }
    }

So I'm apparently missing some code path that spits out a manifest.webapp for WebExtensions when installed via navigator.mozApps.installPackage("https://example.com/update.webapp");

I would rather bypass all validations from AppValidator.prototype.validate as addons are quite different from apps. Some rules may be similar/close, but at the end it is quite different.
Also manifest.manifest_version is a better field to distinguish apps from addons.

We would have liked to have a better architecture in WebIDE, where it would be easier to support new kind of projects like old firefox addons, just a regular webpage or a nodejs app... But we never did the necessary refactoring to make that happen.

Finally, I think we will get rid of all specifics of old fxos addons and remove such checks.

See this changeset, there is a better zipreader api to looks for file existence (hasEntry):
  http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/54f3e2979aa2

Also look into Webapps.jsm modification. We need to replicate it there. We need to call UserCustomizations.checkExtensionManifest/convertManifest functions.

Work in progress patch (v2)

With this patch, WebExtensions can be pushed to and installed on a target device. Minor nits remain.

Realizing I bit off more than expected for my first contribution in here. Thanks for sticking with me, :ochameau.

Outstanding concerns:

1. Upon install, WebExtensions get launched, which loads a window showing the contents of application.zip. Old-style add-ons are, correctly, not launched. Need to grep around and figure out what suppresses the launch RDP message for old-style add-ons.

2. I had to move ~40 lines of installPackagedApp's runnable into a .then() block since DOMApplicationRegistry._writeFile(path, data) is asynchronous. Should I pull in Task.jsm and yield to _writeFile, or is there a synchronous API that I should use?

3. In general, I'm not happy with the cleanliness of the patch.

Can I please get one last round of pointers and preliminary review before I set the r? flag? Thanks!

I'm not blaming you, but doing so much here starts to really make me cringe. We need to expose the right functions from Webapps.jsm instead. That's harder though, so don't feel like you have to do it. File a follow-up on me is ok.

That's not exactly the right logic. What we need in the "normal" install flow is explained at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/apps/Webapps.jsm?rev=8b37e978d607#3707

You need to tweak that:

That's fine, we are used to nested code in this file.
I think it is better to spend time on what fabrice suggested in followup.

I believe this patch addresses the concerns raised above and is ready for proper review.

If this looks good, I'll file a second bug for broader refactoring as discussed above.
Hm. It's hard to see in Bugzilla's side-by-side diff, but there are only whitespace changes to lines 550-591 (old) / 571-612 (new) in toolkit/devtools/server/actors/webapps.js.

They were indented to place them inside a promise chain initiated by _writeFile().

You can remove the old addon support, at the end old addons won't ship in any release.

This message can be disturbing for app developers not knowing about addons.
I would phrase it to something like this:
  A manifest file is required at project root folder.
  Either named 'manifest.webapp' for packaged apps or 'manifest.json' for addons.
...evidently, I don't have try access. Fixing that in Bug 1198717, if you would be so kind as to vouch for me.

I'll fix the error message.

I'd like to wait on pulling the old add-on support until we push a foxfooding build, so we don't break people working on existing add-ons, if that sounds good to you.

Oh, I can push it for you. I thought you already had access to it.

Hum. I think this is only gaia developers, isn't it? But anyway, that sounds good to me.

This is the patch that landed on Try.

Try looks good, other than two unrelated failures. What's the next step to get this landed?

You could send a mail to dev-developer-tools about it.  I think most are *aware* of it, but sometimes it can be hard to remember.

Unfortunately, you'll need a newer build of b2g, since this patch introduced changes on both the WebIDE and target device sides. :(
