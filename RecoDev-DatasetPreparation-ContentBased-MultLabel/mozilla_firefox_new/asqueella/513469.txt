So...

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=nsibrowserinstance and
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=component/browser/instance
only list the interface/component used in (Firefox's) browser.js

In browser.js the component is created only once and stored in a global
variable appCore. http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=appCore
shows this variable is only used in browser.js:
# line 924 -- appCore.startPageCycler();
-- #ifdef'ed ENABLE_PAGE_CYCLER -- I don't see this being defined anywhere.
Plus anyway  nsBrowserInstance::StartPageCycler is a no-op.

# line 1107 -- appCore =
Components.classes["@mozilla.org/appshell/component/browser/instance;1"]
# line 1145 -- appCore.setWebShellWindow(window);
-- startup initialization. The component stores references to the chrome
|window| and the content window, but doesn't appear to do anything else useful.
Also has some debug code, which doesn't appear useful.

# line 1433 -- if (appCore)
# line 1434 -- appCore.close();
-- on shutdown. Doesn't do anything useful (sets a flag, which doesn't seem to
affect anything).

Looks like it can be killed. Anything I missed?

------

It should be possible to remove the component and the interface both from Firefox and mozilla-central, but removing it from Firefox requires packaging changes which tend to cause pain and suffering, and removing it from mozilla-central requires fixing up comm-central, which still uses the component.

Removing references to the component from browser.js is easy though, so let's do it first.
