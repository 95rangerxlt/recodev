User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2535.0 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

When using VR mode using requestFullscreen w/VRDisplay, the forward orientation is 90deg rotated on the x-axis


Actual results:

VR content is displayed pointing towards the ground instead of ahead of the user.

Calling resetSensor() on the device when the user is in the proper start orientation resolves the issue.  


Expected results:

Should start with rotation in the proper forward orientation.

Quick fix for vr rotation in landscape mode

Hi Casey,
I think this patch could fix your problem.

This is a workaround version for VR orientation in the landscape mode. I still need more time to figure out the coordinate transformation between the screen and the sensor to fix it completely.

Quick fix for vr rotation in landscape mode

Thanks for finding this!

Perhaps it would be easier to eliminate the q0 variable and multiply q1 directly into q.

r=me with that

FF Android VR returns orientation that is 90deg off on x-axis.

V2: 
Follow Comment 2, removing q0 variable. 

In the landscape mode, the y and z axis are swapped, so we have to switch y and z terms at Quaternion q and multiply 90degree at x-axis.

This isn't the right fix -- if things aren't working out right, then it's an issue in one or some of:

1) not receiving orientation notifications -- is https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/vr/gfxVRCardboard.cpp#137 being called, and does the orientation have the correct value?

2) the mScreenTransform being incorrectly set in the above location; this should be the thing that sets up the default coord space to be "normal" for the orientation

3) is Remap happening correctly at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/vr/gfxVRCardboard.cpp#45 ? Again this will depend on if the orientation is set right in mOrient

0001-Bug-1215143-FF-Android-VR-returns-orientation-that-i.patch

V2:

I have confirmed the notify function will receive event while orientation changed except PortraitSecondary type. I fix this bug by modifying mScreenTransform while receiving event. In my observation, in portrait mode, it would shift 90 degree at x-axis, so we have to rotate 90 degree at x-axis. In landscape mode, we need to rotate z-axis 90 degree first because its coordinate system have to be changed from the initial portrait mode, and then correcting 90 degree from x-axis. But while we are at landscape mode, the x-axis is swapped to y-axis, so we should use y-axis to transform it.

Instead of doing this multiplication by q0 -- just calculate the correct final quaternion transform and set it explicitly.  The code is basically multiplying a constant by a constant.

Same here.

>+  } else if (mOrient == eScreenOrientation_PortraitPrimary) {

>   }
> }

Also put some more informative comments at the start of this function -- "Fixes for 90 degree on x-axis" doesn't tell someone who's looking at the code much, other than that something was broken that involved 90 degrees and the x-axis.  Instead, add a more descriptive comment like "Android sends us events that have a 90-degree rotation about the x axis compared to what we want (phone flat vs. phone held in front of the eyes).  Correct for this by applying a transform to undo this rotation."
