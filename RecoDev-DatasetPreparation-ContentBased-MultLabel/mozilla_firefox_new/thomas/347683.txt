fix another one

When dropping a tab after the last tab, the old code resulted in an out-of-bounds array access.  Using .item() avoids the warning and returns null more cleanly.

This one affects the 1.8 branch, too. Might want to request approval1.8.1 on it (couldn't hurt!). :)

I'm not entirely certain [] and .item() aren't synonymous, and if I'm right this looks like a bug.

FYI foo[a] is roughly equivalent to
0 <= a && a < foo.length ? foo.item(a) : (report_strict_warning(), undefined);

Added comment explaining why you need to use .item so nobody "cleans up" this code in the future.
