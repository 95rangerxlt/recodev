In bug 762864, the webapprt locale files were (rightfully) moved under webapprt/chrome in the firefox directory. To avoid l10n problems, that was hooked in a hackish way in browser/locales/jar.mn, while the locale files themselves were kept under browser/locales/en-US/webapprt in the source tree.

Now that basically everything related to webapprt has moved to toolkit, bug 762833 requires the webapp runtime to be built as part of the platform instead of browser. Which means the locales also need to be built from toolkit instead of browser. It is thus time to move the locale files where they belong: under webapprt/locales.

You'll need to patch browser/locales/filter.py, too, like

  if mod not in ("netwerk", "dom", "toolkit", "security/manager",
                 "browser", "browser/metro", "extensions/reporter",
                 "extensions/spellcheck",
                 "other-licenses/branding/firefox",
                 "browser/branding/official",
                 "webapprt",
                 "services/sync"):
    return False

Not really picky about where you add webapprt here.

Apart from this, this looks good.

The PPL_LOCALE_ARGS tickled my senses, but that seems to be the same thing as in the general windows installer. I wonder if we should refactor that as follow-up, and/or unify with what jarmaker does these days.
