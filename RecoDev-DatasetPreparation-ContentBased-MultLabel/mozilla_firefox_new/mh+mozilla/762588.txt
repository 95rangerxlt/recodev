In Xulrunner applications, the defaults/pref/ directory under the application directory is not used for preferences, which means channel-prefs.js, being installed there unconditionally, is never going to be read.

Install channel-prefs.js in PREF_DIR when building Firefox as a XULRunner app

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by bug 756325, which was a late landing on aurora (a few days before beta merge).
User impact if declined: Only a problem for people building firefox as a xulrunner application.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): The patch doesn't change anything for mozilla builds.

I'm a little confused.
Isn't it useless to set PREF_JS_EXPORTS _after_ including rules.mk?
