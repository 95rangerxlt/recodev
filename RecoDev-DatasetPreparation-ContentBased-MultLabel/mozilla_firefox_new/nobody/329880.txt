If you provide very long string as the second parameter to InstallTrigger.installChrome() function. The pop up window will be very long and the "OK" and "Cancel" button "disappear".
This may cause user can not install the new theme with long link address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download the testcase.html
2.Click "Click Me"
3.

Actual Results:  
The pop up window is very long, the http link is truncated. "OK" and "Cancel" button "disappear"

Expected Results:  
The pop up window should have a proper width, and the long http link should be display entirely in many lines. The "Cancel" and "OK" buttons are visible. 

Workaround: Enlarge the window by drag it, then you will find the "OK" button.
I also reproduced this bug on linux.

testcase
On Mozilla1.7, althrough the long link is displayed in single line and truncated, the "Cancel" and "OK" button are always visible.
the dialog was changed,
so this bug disappeared with Firefox 2.0.


"OK" button "disappears" if the second parameter passed to InstallTrigger.installChrome() is long enough
