I am using a jump table to link menus in GUIs to Browser-based help pages comprising two frames, a TOC frame and a content frame. Everything works fine in IE. In Firefox however...

Within my site, links with anchors work fine, so I know that the anchors in the HTML pages are formed correctly. Links to HTML pages, from the jump table, also work fine. In contrast, links to anchors in HTML pages, from the jump table, do not work. They land on the right HTML page but not on the anchor.

I strongly suspect that this is because Firefox is calculating where to land based on the size of the entire browser window--not counting frames, the left frame in particular. The reason I suspect this is because if I do not have a help page open and enter a URL to an anchor, I land in the wrong place. However, once a help page is open, the same URL (to an anchor) works.

For example, when I have a virgin Firefox browser window open and I enter file:///C:/Help/HtmlHelp.htm?arvw_addremove, I land on the right page but past the anchor. When I reenter the same URL into the same (non-virgin) browser window, it lands in the right place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a web page that is taller than an average LCD, comprising two frames (a left frame and a right frame), and containing anchors in the bottom half of the page (that is off screen when you are at the top of the page).
2. Create a second page with a link to an anchor that is off screen when you are at the top of the page on the page you created in step 1. 
3. Click the link to the anchor.
Actual Results:  
In a virgin browser, page loads but not with anchor at top of page. In a browser in which the target page is already open, page loads and anchor is at top of page (as it should be).

Expected Results:  
Page should load with anchor at the top of the page.

Please attach a simple page that demonstrates the problem.  You can use src="data:text/html..." to get it all in one file even though it involves frames.
