based on ctrl+tab I have 188 tabs, but pressing the button to show all the
tabs gives 109.
Can you reproduce this?

Are/were there any chrome errors in the error console?
I need to try to reproduce this.

Btw, I was closing the tabs using tabpreview, if that makes any difference.
should be fixed by bug 545583
Thanks!

I'll update my build and re-open this if I can still reproduce.
Though, I haven't seen the problem for awhile.


tabpreview doesn't show all the tabs
