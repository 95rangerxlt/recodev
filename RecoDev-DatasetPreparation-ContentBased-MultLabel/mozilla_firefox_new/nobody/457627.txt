i think that's related to the locale your firefox version is, is your 3.0.3 version a en-US one?
I am using trunk nightly build, en-us.
Does it mean date format now depend on build settings, not on firefox config or system locale?
IIRC it depends on firefox localization you're using
Ok; Should I fill new bug about ignoring system locale settings?
no, this is already saying that in the title


date format on history organizer shows in US format, not in system
