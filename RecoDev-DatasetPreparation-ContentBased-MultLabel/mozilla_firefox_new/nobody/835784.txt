Firebug has the very useful feature of breaking down a request by dns, connecting, sending, waiting, and receiving.

This is great for debugging whether it is payload download size, or server side generation, or maybe just local DNS lookup times are at fault for making an asset or page load slow.

we're going to need this information as well for the net panel feature.
The network event actor should provide this information already - not sure how accurate it is. We just need to show it in the net panel UI.

Thanks for the bug report.
This was fixed by bug 855544.


Console should have a breakdown of request time in the Network Panel
