Looks like it is more or less related to bug 1192532.

When I try to login with a nightly build built after august 7, gmail login process is stalled.

If I launch nightly from command line, I got this message :

"Performance warning: Async animation disabled because frame size (13288, 253) is bigger than the viewport (1288, 690) or the visual rectangle (13288, 253) is larger than the max allowable value (17895698) [div]"

All I know it that started with august 8 nightly. Before that, no problems at all.

Is this the component that was intended? I don't see the relationship to Service Workers.

When I search for "async animation" in bugzilla, I found bugs in this component. Feel free to change it to the right one.

I'm kinda lost here :(
I'm going to throw this back in Untriaged for now. Frederic, can you reproduce this problem in safe mode or a new profile? https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode

I will try with latest nightly and report what happen with both a new profile and in safe mode in a few minutes from now.
Some feedbacks.

Using this nightly, 20150810030205 - https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0e269a1f1beb

In Safe mode 

Gmail is not stalled, but there is still this error message in terminal :

Performance warning: Async animation disabled because frame size (13288, 253) is bigger than the viewport (1152, 621) or the visual rectangle (13288, 253) is larger than the max allowable value (17895698) [div]

With a new profile : the same as in safe mode. And when I try to load my google plus main page, I fall back in the behaviour I described in bug 1192532.
It sounds like either an extension that's installed is causing the stalls, or a preference in a non-default value. Try disabling all extensions?

I have the same behaviour in both a clean profile and in safe-mode. I do a profile reset yesterday. My only extension, when enabled ? µblock origin.

And as I told you, this behaviour happens in both cases : safe mode and new profile.
Forgot to add : I'm staying with this nightly build (Built from https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/91de9c670800) in order to keep a working browser.

I know, but disabling any extensions in the profile that stall would narrow down whether it was being caused by an extension or a modified preference.
Looks like I have a regression window :

Last working build : https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/91de9c670800 => Fri, 07 Aug 2015 11:52:29 +0200
First broken build : https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3e51753a099f => Fri, 07 Aug 2015 13:13:06 +0200

Or, these two builds are just one after another in tinderbox tree.

Really weird :(

Talking about preferences ? Could be too simple to be true. 

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/3e51753a099f/browser/app/profile/firefox.js

Will try to reverse this change and I will try with an official updated nightly.
Please, ignore the end of my previous comment. Here is the commit list between these two builds :

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=91de9c670800&tochange=3e51753a099f

There is a lot of it. Any guess ?!
A really not educated guess : could it be either bug 1181392 or bug 1180125 ?

Both are related to animation. I don't really know if it is a good guess or not. But there is something like 99 commits listed :(
Can you try to narrow down the range using the mozregression tool? http://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/
Using mozregression :

mozregression --good 2015-08-06 --bad 2015-08-08

Getting inbound builds between 32712cd01159 and 943b79d9c65f

But I cannot reproduce the bug with any of these inbound builds :(
No particular news, but bug 1193796 seems to have sprung up on the 8th as well and sounds like it may be related.

Looks like something really broke JS on august 8...
The apparently related bug has been fixed, so this bug is probably fixed.
(There's another Gmail break with the 15 August build, bug 1195027.)

This bug is fixed indeed. But I noticed the new one today. I have to "downgrade" to my yesterday homemade build to workaround it.

Adding myself to the new gmail-breaker bug. Thanks for the tip.
Should be fixed by the linked bugs and reported fixed.
