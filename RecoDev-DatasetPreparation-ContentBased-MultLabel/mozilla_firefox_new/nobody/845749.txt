User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130220104816

Steps to reproduce:

With FF20 the developer toolbar (Shift-F2) includes the CSS inspector. 


Actual results:

The CSS inspector is now limited to the height of the developer toolbar pane. While in my use case I need to work with many styles, I don't need more of the developer toolbar than just the selector or potentially the JS log.

Previously, the CSS inspector would be aligned to the right-hand side of the window allowing full hide of the CSS panel while limiting screen estate of the JS log.

With the current implementation, the developer toolbar has become a huge screen hog.


Expected results:

Please separate CSS inspector and developer toolbar again into separate panels.
