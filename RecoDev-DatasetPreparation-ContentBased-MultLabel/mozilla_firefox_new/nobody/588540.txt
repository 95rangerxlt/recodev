Patch v1

Currently, when you inspect a network requests that sent some data to the server as form data, the form data is show only as ugly to read string (they way it's sent to the server). Tree the case of sending form data to the server special and format the data in key: value pairs.

Is there a function called _setI10N in the network panel patch? shouldn't it be setL10N?

Otherwise looks good.

Patch v1.1

>+    let fromDataRegExp = /Content-Type\:\s+application\/x-www-form-urlencoded/;
I think you want to cache this globally (compiling regular expressions isn't exactly cheap).

Also, per RFC 822 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.1.2), a space after the colon is not necessary, so the regular expression should be: /Content-Type\:\s*application\/x-www-form-urlencoded/
A test for the no whitespace case should also be added.

r=sdwilsh with those changes
