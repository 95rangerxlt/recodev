Proper Menubar Firefox addon is slow:

And receive this message in my browser console log:
mutating the [[Prototype]] of an object will cause your code to run very slowly; instead create the object with the correct initial [[Prototype]] value using Object.create

hi Stefan, if you have any questions about add-on support for multiprocess Firefox (e10s), just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
The developer has been contacted through AMO.
Ah, he filed the bug. Never mind ;)
Stefan, does your latest version address this bug? Do you need any help getting this resolved?
think it's OK
(note: part of the code engine is the same as "Turn Off the Lights" Firefox add-on)
This add-on seems to be working fine, so I'm closing this bug. Turn Off the Lights seems to be a different story, though.


"Proper Menubar" add-on does not work with e10s
