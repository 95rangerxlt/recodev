The main menu items remain highlighted when you move the mouse from them up onto
the title bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move mouse onto one of the main menu items, e.g. File. It should highlight in
blue or something
2. Move mouse up onto the title bar

Actual Results:  
The menu remains highlighted unless you are on a classic theme and move the
mouse slow enough

Expected Results:  
The menu should no longer be highlighted since your mouse is no longer over it.

I suspect this has been around for a while but made more apparent since bug
303806 enlarged the menus to touch the top of the toolbar.

This affects toolbar buttons as well.

ShawnRisk on irc is confirming this on win2k so i'm wrong ;)

Regression from this bug: right click to menu (eg. Bookmarks) and then left click on the page. Menu stays highlighted.

That is not a regression from this bug. Firstly a regression is something that has broken as a result of some code being checked in, since there has been no code checked in from this bug, this bug cannot have caused it. Secondly the problem you describe also exists in Firefox 1.0.7, so it may not even be a regression at all.
It seems only to happen if moving the mouse over the menu bar while a page is loading, not after the page has loaded.  Please bring back the more subtle highlights!  This blue stuff is unnerving.

That is not the case at all for me. It is reproducable all the time.

I suspect this is the same issue: This happens with the highlight over the options pane selector.

Confirmed here, its obviously affecting all users.  Comment 6 is also correct and another example of this bug.  Now, can we have some information on whats happening with this, its a pretty serious UI bug.
*** Bug 315502 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Probably the same as/related to bug 297080.
*** Bug 316123 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Patch for bug 312566 also fixed this.
-> FIXED
*** Bug 318771 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Hang on, this is certainly not resolved or fixed, if so how so?  It is apparent for all users on Firefox 1.5.  If it has been fixed when will the patch be release with Firefox, because it should be soon, its a serious UI flaw.
The bugzilla's "FIXED" means that the bug is fixed on Trunk.
It's not related to release builds.
