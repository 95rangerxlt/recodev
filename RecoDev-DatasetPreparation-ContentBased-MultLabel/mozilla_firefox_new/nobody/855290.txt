FWIW : http://people.mozilla.com/~zfang/Customization/MenuPanel.jpg
The first set of widgets that should have subviews would be:
1) History
2) Bookmarks
Picking these first since they already have sidebars.

Other potential subviews could be:
* DevTools
* Downloads

I'll start working on the History subview.

What about print ? Should it only open print preview ?

And Help ?
Filed bug 855803 for you jaws, for the History subview.

I'll take Bookmarks (bug 855805).

zfang / shorlander: What other widgets should we add to this list?
From last week's Australis meeting:

Printing can take the user to print preview
DevTools can open the toolbox (need to sync up with the DevTools team)
Downloads -> Open the library
History -> will open a subview (bug 855803)
Bookmarks -> will open a subview (we think - bug 855805)
Character encoding -> ?
Help -> ?
(In reply to Mike Conley (:mconley) from comment #5)

Thank you for bringing up the issue, I almost forgot I need to follow up with the SUMO team on this! I talked to them a while ago about "Help" in Australis and here's the thought process: 

In Windows Help menu I have: 
- Help (SUMO Page)
- Getting Started
- Troubleshooting
- Submit Feedback
- Restart w/ add-on disabled
- About Firefox
On Mac there's no "Getting started" but there's "Report web forgery". And in nightly there's "Firefox Health Report".

Originally the plan was: 
1. "Help" button just open the SUMO page
2. A separate info icon for "About Firefox" in the panel
3. Remove "Getting Started" and "report web forgery" 
4. Remove "submit feedback" for now and maybe make them in-context in the future (see shorlander's mock-up http://cl.ly/image/3q2k2x1D0y0a0N0e3A0Q/o) OR put the smiley/sad face in the panel if it's not a good idea to remove "submit feedback".
5.Remove "troubleshooting" and "restart without add-ons" (because they are <2% features and most users access them through SUMO page)

The SUMO team agree with 1-4 but has some concerns on 5 and don't think removing troubleshooting funcitons is a good idea. So in the meantime we can either make this a terribly looking drop-down, or move Help up into the Panel and use the subview structure.

Example: http://cl.ly/image/1m3L092f0C2j The left one is the original plan, the right one is the terribly looking dropdown.
Note: Unfocused brought up a good point that we need "exit" button in Windows, that's why in the mock-up "Customize" is up in the main panel. But moving Help up instead might make more sense.
Another issue would be the DevTools : if we consider it should just open the toolbox it would be problematic. The Toolbox is an UI entry point for many Dev tools, but not all : especially the Developer Toolbar, Character encoding, get more tools and the error console (AFAIK that should be gone) since Page source is accessible via page's contextual menu and Work offline should go away all the same.
A subview or change to the devtoolbox seem the best idea.

The main question about what should be in the panel and the customization palette is still unanswered though ( http://people.mozilla.com/~zfang/Customization/MenuPanel.jpg ?)
I very often use View Info, but mostly to see the saved passwords for a site, this would be a nice one to have available?

View info is available via the Larry panel and the contextual menu, I don't think there is need for it in the menu panel.
Ok, here's the list I got from shorlander last week (which confirms that http://people.mozilla.com/~zfang/Customization/MenuPanel.jpg gives us our definitive list):

Default in panel:

New Window - opens new window, closes panel
Private Browsing - opens new private browsing window, closes panel
Save Page - opens save page dialog, closes panel
Print - ? [realized now that we never sorted this]
History - opens subview in panel, ? in nav-bar
Full Screen - switches to full-screen mode, closes panel
Find - opens find bar, closes panel
Preferences - opens preferences window, closes panel
Add-ons - opens add-ons tab, closes panel
Cut/Copy/Paste
-/100%/+

Default items in nav-bar:

Back/forward button
Location + Reload
Bookmarks
Downloads
Menu


Available menu panel items in customization palette:

Subscribe
Character Encoding
Tab Groups
Sync
Reload
Stop
Home
Open File
Developer
Search bar

Items that behave differently in the panel than in the nav-bar:
Downloads - in nav-bar, opens downloads panel. In panel, opens Downloads view in Library.
Bookmarks - in nav-bar, is a split button that bookmarks the page, and shows bookmarks menu popup. In panel, displays a subview (see bug 855805)
History - in nav-bar, does ? - in panel, shows a subview (see bug 855803)
(In reply to Mike Conley (:mconley) from comment #10)
> Print - ? [realized now that we never sorted this]

In the last meetings it has been agreed on that it will open print preview (print and print setup are accessible there).

> Available menu panel items in customization palette:
> 
> Character Encoding
> Reload
> Stop


These three items are problematic. 

First how Character Encoding will work ? (open a subview/panel ?)

Stop and reload will normally be merged to the location bar so to have a second item to use them seems redundant.

Yes, I recall this too - though I've just noticed that Print Preview isn't available on OSX (and when I force it to open programmatically, I get a very broken interface)...

This is a very good question. I don't actually know, and this needs to be determined.

Yeah it's not very nice and something must be sorted out at least until print preview is redesigned on all platforms (often wanted papercut, but not planned for a near future AFAIK).

It should be sorted out along with my concern in comment 7.

So I think the solution here is to just open up the Print dialog, in the case of OSX.
Do we want to get rid of "email link" (that will become "share") in the menu panel ?
The needinfo here seems not necessary anymore since we have the list.

> The needinfo here seems not necessary anymore since we have the list.

Good point, thanks.
Closing this bug since we got the list in comment #10.

Also, removing bugs that were marked as 'blocking' this bug, since they don't actually block this bug. Bugs related to implementing widgets should 'block' bug 855287.


Determine what built-in widgets to ship
