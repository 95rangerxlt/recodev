When I click on a favorite that I had created in IE, like google search, I get a windows error message "windows cannot find 'http://google.com' ... Then the site pops up in firefox. This happens with all my favorites

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click any favorite
2.error message appears 'windows cannot find 'http://...
3.site come up but error message remains.



This only started  in the last week or 2. I removed and reloaded both IE and foxfire. still happens. When foxfire removed the favorites work fine. The bookmarks work fine on firefox.
