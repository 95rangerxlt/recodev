Use transition events.

If you use timeouts to wait for transitions, you're gonna have a bad time.

This patch adds a ResponsiveUI:Transition event that is fired on the stack after the responsiveUI is done animating.

A simpler fix would just be to always disable transitions during the tests.  Thoughts?

Isn't that what we do in the Style Editor?
