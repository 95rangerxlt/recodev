clearInterval has no effect within a web worker - it does not clear the specified interval.

Unfortunately, my code is not ready for launch yet, so I can't show you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I think you'd have to create a web worker and experiment with intervals within it.
2.
3.



It can be worked around by manually setting a boolean value and checking within the interval, however this means that the interval persists, and in my code which generates intervals programmatically, after a while this builds up.
