Scenario: You use somebody else's / a public PC to check for email. You enter your address and password, login, dismiss the "Remember password?" notification, read your mail, log out and leave. Anyone would now be able to click the key icon in the location bar, remember the password and login to your account or open the password manager to read your password.

Same deal as bug 595175 - they only last 10 seconds more than the previous notifications did (30s vs. 20s), but there's no way to completely remove them.
As far as I remember a few page loads (e.g. the logout hopefully) used to remove the info bar automatically too.
I can confirm the following security issues with gmail, all run from a new profile.

1. Logon to gmail, ignore or dismiss the remember password notification.
logout within 30 seconds - scenario where user sees immediately they have no new mail.
2. From the logout screen the password notification remains long after 30 seconds
3. Click the password notification and click remember
4. Double click the gmail username field, form fill has remembered the username
5. F5 or refresh the page and the password is filled in, allowing logon to an unauthorised user after the real user has logged off

Do the same but remain within gmail for > 30 seconds, the password notification is removed at logoff

That happens with the new notifications too - any page loads after the timeout has elapsed will remove it. The old notifications use persistence++ (ignore the first page load) and timeout: 20 (show for at least 30 seconds), while the new notifications just use timeout: 30.

The logic for both notification types is identical:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/f7c46270db80/toolkit/content/widgets/notification.xml#l191
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/f7c46270db80/toolkit/content/PopupNotifications.jsm#l252
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/f7c46270db80/browser/base/content/browser.js#l4296
Ok, assuming this all works as expected (e.g. the page loads are counted correctly, it doesn't matter when the popup was dismissed), I suppose the timeout makes the difference. I always had the impression that the notification bar magically disappeared when it seemed about right. Why was the timeout increased in the first place?
No good reason, AFAICT. The patch in bug 595175 re-adjusts it.
Shouldn't this bug be dup'd?
This should block. If bug 595175 fixes it, great, but it should block.
They're not duplicates, they're just related.
Though maybe we can consider this FIXED by 
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6095c6b1f50f .
Shouldn't the password dialog have an option "don't save now", as the notification bar had? It is clear that there is a difference between dismissing by ignoring the dialog and actually refusing it. Say I log into my email on someone else's computer so that he can read an email of mine... I'd have to leave the site and return in order to prevent that someone from possibly stealing my password. It may seem a bit paranoia, but I think it is understandable that people would think that way.

I agree, it's something this notification lacks. Please file a new bug, though.

The timing issue has apparently been fixed in bug 595175.


Dismissed "Remember password?" notification sticks around for too long

privacy, regression
