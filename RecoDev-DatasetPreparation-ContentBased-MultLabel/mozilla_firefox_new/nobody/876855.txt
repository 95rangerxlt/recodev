STR:
1. Install EFF's HTTPS Everywhere addon:
https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

I can reproduce this bug with both the add-ons stable version 3.2.2 and the development version 4.0development7.

2. Open about:addons
3. Open HTTPS Everywhere addon's Preferences
4. Search for a random site name that does not exist

RESULT:
The dialog's list will show a long list of red X's. This is a regression in Firefox 22.

I see a likely culprit exception:

[17:19:09.871] TypeError: props is undefined @ chrome://https-everywhere/content/preferences.js:181

Which is inside this getCellProperties implementation:

https://gitweb.torproject.org/https-everywhere.git/blob/HEAD:/src/chrome/content/preferences.js#l175

Over here the docs say that getCellProperties is obsolete in Gecko 22 :(

Here's a parallel HTTPS Everywhere bug for this: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8997
getCellProperties isn't obsolete, they've just removed the third argument to it.
This should be fixed in https://eff.org/files/https-everywhere-4.0development.8.xpi and should get a stable branch fix shortly afterwards.
Well, we are just shipping a stable fix for this (extremely late, given that Firefox 22 is stable today).  But strangely, I can't repro this in either nightly or Firefox 22 stable anymore.


HTTPS Everywhere addon's site search shows a long list of red X's, starting in Firefox 22
