I tested this with the latest stable version of FCKeditor for Plone, version 2.6.6.1.  The results are similar.  I don't see the red FCKeditor loading... message, but the editor never loads.

Joe Bigler
Correction, that is version 2.6.5.1, not 2.6.6.1

Joe Bigler
It works in SeaMonkey 2.0.3.  We are currently going to tell our editors that have FF 2.5.8 to not upgrade until this issue is fixed.  We will ask those that have 3.6 to use SeaMonkey.

Last night I installed the latest version of FCKeditor 2.6.5.1 on our live server.  The editor does load in FF 3.6.  It still doesn't work on our test server, but that means it is a local issue, not one with FF or FCKeditor.  If there is a problem with older versions of FCKeditor, the solution seems to be to upgrade to the newest version.  I sent this in a report to FCKeditor's bug list.  This can be closed.  Thank you.
