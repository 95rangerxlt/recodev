As a site developer, when I embed a PDF file into an inline iframe and, in the same page I have a drop-down-menu, the hovered menu should appear on the embedded file, but it doesn't; the drop-down-menu simply goes behind the PDF.
Please feel free to reference http://home.michiganmutual.com/Rates.aspx as example, but I should warn you that this is not the perfect replica as for me, the embedded PDF file works just fine for IE8 (I am an ASP.NET developer if this can help somehow) . This example shows the described situation, for Firefox.
Many thanks to Firefox team


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a drop-down-menu
2. Right after that create an iframe which must source an PDF file
3. Browse the page with Firefox and notice the menu behaviour: it goes behind PDF

I wonder if this is related to Bug 471526....the sample page provided use z-index and the PDF viewer. George...if you could produce the least amount of code required to exhibit this issue that would help.
This will be fixed by Fx 3.6.
