I think the thumbnail image should store in other place like jumplist icon of Win7 rather than disk cache folder.

These users will lost their thumbnail image at Firefox start-up
 1)purging cache when Firefox exit
 2)those who disables disk cache, and uses memory instead
 3)some "cleaner" soft just take cache as useless temp files and delete them.

The new tab page meant to give an easy accessibility of frequency sites, apparent that is not the case with blank thumbnail at start-up.


I don't know the exact proportion of users will do the above regularly, but minority counts too.

We're thinking about implementing a 'pin' mechanism for items in the cache (bug 716949).

No idea why people would do that but alas, there is a pref and a bunch of add-ons seem to flip it *sigh*. That's bug 724408.

We can't and I don't think we should work around some 3rd party software messing around in our profiles (thought it's valid point by itself).

Resolving as WONTFIX.

...perhaps because we offer that pref? In privacy setting, user can clear cache at shutdown.
I think the status of this needs to be changed now thatt he thumbnails actually have their own folder, albeit, currently in the wrong profile location.
Fixed by bug 744388.

In rare cases that's not good enough (deleted files are recoverable), but I'm pretty sure the real reason we have that was for the embedding case (at one time including mobile) where we may not have the space for physical cache or where repeatedly writing to flash memory shortens the device life too much.
