I really like that Task.jsm detects certain kinds of exceptions and prints out warnings before forwarding them to the next promise. I don't like that we have this problem in the first place... why don't we have a way to mark a promise chain as "done"?

There are 11 or so warnings printed out while running mochitest-dt tests. They all look like real errors. Attached is a sampling. I ran this after converting the debugger frontend to Task.jsm in bug 991797, so maybe we just hadn't seen this before.

We should fix these.

The debugger tests are now clean of such failures.
