This is fixed in my user repo: http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ddahl_mozilla.com/heads-up-display/file/42b38ea8143e/toolkit/components/console/content/headsUpDisplay.css

Also, the scrolling action was fixed via using html nodes and node.scrollIntoView

All patches are on bug 534398


'functional CSS' for output nodes
