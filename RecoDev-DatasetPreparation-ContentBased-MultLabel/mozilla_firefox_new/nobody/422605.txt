When using Firefox 3.0 (Beta 1 to 4), while having the Murrine Gtk2 Cairo Engine enabled (http://www.cimitan.com/murrine/), Some stuff does not display correctly. The menubar should have a glassy style, but it is just blue. The buttons have a default style, but not the one of Murrine. All those things worked perfectly in Firefox 2.

I see this as a major problem, since Murrine will get the default Gtk engine of Ubuntu (8.04).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Gnome with Murrine Gtk2 Cairo Engine
2. Startup Firefox 2.* and watch the nice theme
3. Now startup Firefox 3.0
Actual Results:  
Murrine theme doesn't work with Firefox 3.0

Expected Results:  
Murrine theme works with Firefox 3.0

Could you post a screenshot? Are you using the Firefox version from Ubuntu, or the one from mozilla.com? Thanks
I'm using Firefox 2.0 from Ubuntu (2.0 form mozilla.com works as well) and the 3.0 version from mozilla.com. I have attached screenshots of 2.0 and 3.0 version.

Thanks for your quick reply. I have tested the default Ubuntu theme, and I do not see the same appearance. Did you install the Murrine engine youself? I do not see it in the appearance configuration screen. Apparently the default Ubuntu theme for hardy is Human-Murrine:

gconftool-2 -g /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_theme -g /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme -g /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_color_scheme
Human-Murrine
Human
No value set for `/desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_color_scheme'

Are you getting error messages if you run Firefox from the console? The issue could be that the 32bit version of Firefox isn't able to load some libraries. For instance, I see no icons when I try that version with the default theme.
Well, i use the glassy murrine theme, but i'm still on ubuntu gutsy. In fact I get error messages when starting Firefox 3.0:

Ah, and i'm running 64 bit Firefox.

> Ah, and i'm running 64 bit Firefox.

Don't you mean that your system is 64bit and your Firefox version is 32bit (the one you download on http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html)?

That should the situation according to your User Agent string (Linux i686 (x86_64))

In that situation, the issue is that Ubuntu does not provide a 32bit version of the murrine gtk engine on Gutsy (and Hardy). You can check the list of engines in provided in the ia32-libs package, for Gutsy:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/amd64/ia32-libs/filelist
For Hardy:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/amd64/ia32-libs/filelist

(look in the /usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines path).

So this isn't really a Firefox issue, but more a Ubuntu one. You could file a bug in launchpad on the ia32-libs package to ask for the murrine engine to be included (if it isn't reported already). There is already a bug filed to include some other Gnome libraries in that package: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ia32-libs/+bug/162993
Hm if that is true, I will now take the source code of 3.0b4 (ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.0b4/source/firefox-3.0b4-source.tar.bz2) and compile it. After that, it should work according to you.
Or you could use the unofficial 64bit nightlies. For instance http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/firefox-3.0b5pre.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2

(I forgot to add that the 64bit nightlies are the latest version of the trunk, so they may be less stable than if you compile from the beta 4 sources yourself)

That's not that important, it's just for testing ;).
In fact it works with the 64bit version. Maybe you should offer the 64bit builds in the download section as well, so that this mistake won't appear another time.
Yes, I think there is a bug open for having official 64bit Linux releases. I didn't find it by quickly looking.
