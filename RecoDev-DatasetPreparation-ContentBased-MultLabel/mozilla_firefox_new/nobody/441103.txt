If I visit a page which is on the blacklist I get the malware warning page. If I want to ignore the warning (i.e. because "more information" tells me that there wasn't any malware distribution in the past 90 days on that page or because I know the page is secure again) and I click "ignore this warning" and then if I get redirected or I click on a link pointing to the same site I get the warning again.
In cooperation with bug 441101 it is impossible to post in forums which are on the blacklist except you disable the malware warning generally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page which is on the blacklist and that does contain links to itself or other pages on the same site
2. Ignore the warning
3. Click a link which points to that site
Actual Results:  
You will get the warning again.

Expected Results:  
The "ignore this warning" option should be reminded for the whole session. Alternative/in addition it should be possible to add that page to a personal whitelist.

User-Agent / Build Identifier above is wrong (override was active); I'm using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Increased to major because this bug makes it nearly impossible to use that new feature.
Seems to be fixed in 3.0.3. Thank you.


Option to ignore the malware warning for a certain page/site or ignore for whole session
