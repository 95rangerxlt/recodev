On either HTMLDocument type or XMLDocument type Mozilla Firefox is not consistent with returning a viable XPath Result node set via document.implementation

Attached shortly will be some sample code with expected results versus actual results similar to the MDC wiki pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.XPath d.evaluate doesn't return an XPath Result on a document.implementation
2.See attachment for sample code
3.getElementById works but XPath Result node set not found
Actual Results:  
getElementById works but XPath Result node set not found

Expected Results:  
Several developers are expecting document.evaluate to return the XPath Result node set yet there are multiple instances where this is not working.

I'm hoping implementation of the code is correct as I've spent several weeks discussing this among other developers, reading tons of articles and chatting on other forums.  Please be kind if there is something incorrect about the code and any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Clean profile used in all test cases under 3.5.X to 3.6.X (and even one nightly 3.7 build earlier this month)

 Sample document.implementation with XPath Result Passing

Sample document.implementation with XPath Result passing.

Apparently the namespaceResolver must be present and set to exactly the same as the first parameter in createDocument

MDC documentation seems a bit incomplete on this matter and after many loose hairs floating about I think I've achieved a successful implementation.
Closing as "fixed" in this scenario.


document.implementation XPath failure via d.evaluate
