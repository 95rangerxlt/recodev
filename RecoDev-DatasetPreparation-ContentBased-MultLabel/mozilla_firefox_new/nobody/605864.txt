Please attach the install.log from inside the installation directory from after the failed attempt to run the installer. The directory is typically under your program files directory in a sub directory named "Mozilla Firefox"

Dear all,
to my surprise today firefox started and did the update to 3.6.11 without any error message or problem. Thank you anyway for your efforts to solve the problem.
So I will mark this as resolved and fixed.
thanks for all
