We're going to remove this API in bug 927245, please use Web Audio instead.

We're going to remove this API in bug 927245, please use Web Audio instead.
The good news is that it looks like Shumway doesn't require any changes to handle the API's removal.  It already prefers Web Audio over the Audio Data API: https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/blob/master/src/flash/media/SoundChannel.js#L200

I couldn't find any other references in the source, so we can probably close this bug.
Well, we should still remove that code, but looks like this doesn't need to block bug 927245.
Yury, if I interpret the source correctly, this is fixed, right?
We removed code associated with Audio Data API (it was used as a fallback if Web Audio was not found).

Stop using the Moz Audio Data API in Shumway
