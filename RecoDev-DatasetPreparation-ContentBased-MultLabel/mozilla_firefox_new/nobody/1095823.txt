Hey vijay, can you try logging into Facebook with your add-ons disabled and see if that works?

If so, I'd suspect a misbehaving add-on.
I tried with all addons disabled in a new profile. I am able to load facebook successfully.

I will try to test with each addon enabled.
I tested and it is "Https everywhere" addon that is causing this problem. With this addon disabled, I am able to login successfully. But I am not able to login with this addon enabled.
I believe the HTTPSEverywhere authors have e10s compatibility fixes landed on their tip - but I'm not sure if those fixes have been shipped in releases yet.

Cc'ing somebody involved with HTTPSEverywhere - do you know when the fixes will be released in your add-on?
HTTPS Everywhere should ship their e10s fixes in a week or two:
https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/pull/526#event-192402756
This should block bug 1014986
This appears to be fixed.


Unable to login to Facebook in E10S mode with HTTPS Anywhere addon enabled
