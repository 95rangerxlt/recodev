Don't know about the blocking call on this one. We're technically doing incorrect behavior here showing the icon when we get HARDWARE_UNAVAILABlE. Need info on Maire for a blocking call.
I don't think we should block the gUM release for this bug because we "fail safe": We say we have access to the camera when we don't.  If the opposite were true, I'd definitely block.

That said, we should prioritize getting this fixed in Fx22 Nightly and uplifted into Fx21 Aurora soon.  I'm not sure that we should push to get a fix for this uplifted into Fx20 Beta, even if we have a fix very soon, because I'm not sure this fix is worth any risk (even a low risk) to Beta.  Instead I'd rather note this bug in the release notes for Fx20 and be clear that a fix is coming (and when the fix is coming if we know that by the time of the Fx20 release).
Similar reason as GPU bug - no need to track for 20, but we should get this in for the "followup" stabilization release for gUM
This should be fixed by bug 843971.

Called from Windows 7 x64 on Windows 8 x32, result: HARDWARE_UNAVAILABLE appears in red font and the camera is not active. 
Called from Mac OS X 10.8.3 on Windows 8 x32, result: A green camera indicator is present and the camera is active.
There are two different behaviors but none of them are similar to the Actual results from comment 0 so I think this is fixed on Firefox 22 beta 5 (buildID: 20130612084701).


Requesting access to your camera when it's in use by an external program still shows a visible indicator that the camera is in use
