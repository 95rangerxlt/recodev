Hi Chris, I'm not clear if this is work that needs to happen in Firefox or in the extension. If it's something we're going to work on, could you confirm the bug? Thanks!

Good question! :) Some e10s problems will require the extension to fix their code, but we plan to add some workarounds in Firefox itself for the most common add-on problems. I don't know what the exact failure is for this extension yet.

btw, if you see any bugs that mention e10s that don't have the "tracking-e10s" tracking flag set, please set "tracking-e10s" to '?' so the e10s team will triage the bugs. I try to track new e10s bugs, but I may miss some.
The developer has been contacted through AMO.
This appears to be working just fine now. Rather cool addon actually, should be featured for the disability benefits.
I suppose it's working because of changes to the compatibility shims, since there has been no update for this add-on in a couple of years. I suppose that's all we can expect from this add-on for now. Calling it fixed since it appears to be working.
