Currently developer tools has 2 template engines. DOMPlate from Firebug and DOM Template from Bespin. There could also be better ways to do this in Firefox.

There should be at most one template engine.

I don't think this bug should be in the meta for Firefox 4. I doubt we can rewrite the tree panel (or the style panel) for Fx 4. (just a thought)
probably true. And after the improvements we've made to the domplate code, I'm loathe to throw it away and start from scratch right now.
removed DOMplate in bug 797527.
Maybe you could remove all the other templating systems from the Internet in a follow-up?


There should only be one Templating system
