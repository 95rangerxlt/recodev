Focus ring being drawn on a notification bar button on OS X

This is actually a regression, although I am not sure what the range is.  I'm also not sure what caused the problem to appear, but the buttons in notification bars now draw a focus ring when you interact with them using the mouse (including the small close button).  It is possible that we've previously been relying on images (similar to the toolbar buttons in the OS X them) so the focus ring wasn't showing up, but now that these are being exposed as buttons, they pick up bug 418521

Maybe bug 476370 caused this? ;-)
ah, right, sec508 violation.  Ok, we might as well keep this around since it depends on 418521.  Nothing to see here, move along :)
fixed by bug 418521


Notification bars on OS X should not draw a focus ring on buttons
