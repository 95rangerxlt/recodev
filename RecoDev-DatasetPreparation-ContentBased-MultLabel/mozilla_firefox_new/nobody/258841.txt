when you pick view > page style > no style, you can see that the autoscroll icon
is wrongly positioned. i guess it's because of the style beiing removed from the
autoscroll image (that still excists in the DOM).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. view > page style > nostyle
2. autoscroll
3.
Actual Results:  
icon is wrongly positioned

Expected Results:  
display correctly

Confirming with the same build on XP.
autoscroll in the DOM sucks, but this isn't a blocker, especially since No Style
may not make 1.0.
