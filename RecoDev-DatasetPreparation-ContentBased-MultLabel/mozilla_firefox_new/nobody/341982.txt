chrome://browser/skin/browser.css contains some "%ifdef MOZ_PLACES" lines.  I'm guessing these were intended for some kind of build-time preprocessor rather than our CSS parser ;)  This causes two sets of five CSS warnings each during startup.

I'm using a clean Mac trunk debug build.

See bug 336176 (which was reopened for this issue).
Btw, I'm curious why this causes two sets of five errors each, rather than just one set of five errors.  I'm only opening one browser window...
Fixed in bug 336176. (My guess for doubles would be hiddenwindow: it includes macBrowserOverlay.xul, which includes chrome://browser/skin/, which is browser.css.)
