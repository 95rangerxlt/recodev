This just started happening after the last update.

When you click the submit button the window is stuck on the loading image.
It should show http://demos.mootools.net/demos/Ajax.Form/ajax.form.php like in all other versions of firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
explained in details
1. click submit
2. watch loading image......

do you see this problem in the latest trunk build (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/) ? 
Found Problem!
I had been running Firebug on the page and It is not supported above 2.x (I modified the code to work on 3.x) and it was causing the trouble.

My bad!

Resolving as fixed (disable firebug on all sites with the mootools code)


ajax form submit on mootools will not load, stuck on loading image
