Build ID: 20120412030726

Steps to reproduce:

Use Aurora/Nightly as usual, dragging bookmarks into the nine speed-dial slots(Since I have Firefox set not to record history)


Actual results:

Thumbnails never appeared, I just saw blank boxes.


Expected results:

Screenshots of the websites should have appeared in the boxes.
