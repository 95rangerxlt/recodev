I am running latest Firefox on WinXP SP2. Every time I start up I have to go to Options>Privacy>Cookies and reset "Allow sites to set cookies" so I can get into sites that store my identity in cookies. Without doing this I cannot get into my.yahoo.com even by signing in, because the attempt to get into the next page fails with no cookie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check "Allow sites to set cookies" 
2. Close Firefox
3. Go to my.yahoo.com

Actual Results:  
1. Instead of getting to my home page, it goes to generic page with a "sign in" link. 
2. I sign in
3. It tells me Yahoo unable to set or retieve cookies and I must change mu settings.
4. I change setting as above, and Yahoo works perfectly.
5. I close Firefox
6. I reopen firefox and go to my.yahoo.com
7. Repeats as above


Expected Results:  
Since I have stored an identity cookie, which Firefox recognizes after I check "Allow sites to set cookies", Yahoo opens my personal home page.

This has not happened before. It just started happening about 5 days ago. I'm assuming Firefox updated itself with one or more patches at that time, and one of them created this problem.
Since this has not been reported before, It may be because of interaction with one of my installed extensions (I have many of them).

I think you're better off with technical support for this issue, it's unclear what the bug is. See http://www.mozilla.org/support/

The most common causes for these symptoms are listed at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Preferences_not_saved
I have validated that bug is still in version of Firefox 2.0 downloaded from mozilla.org 10/31/06.
Following update to Firefox 2.0 and updating of all available extensions in my syetem, all preferences including cookie settings are now retained and retreived properly.

This validates my conjecture that problem was in recently-introduced update to Firefox 5.0.7.1 or one of my extensions caused the recurrent problem.


The "Allow sites to set cookies" setting does not "stick" between sessions
