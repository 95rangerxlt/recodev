When I load this website firefox will crash as if it had exited itself. No error message is displayed. When I start up I am given the option of restoring the session if it is restored firefox will attempt to reload the page and repeat the crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.bigpond.com
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Crashed displaying desktop or windows underneath firefox. Does not display any error message. 

Expected Results:  
It should have rendered the webpage.

I am using the default theme and have Download them all and ie tab installed, however I was not using these extensions at the time.

Moving to General for triage and testing.

I am not able to reproduce this crash but I did have one instance of Firefox 3b4 hanging with 100% CPU usage on bigpond.com (that was with DownThemAll and IE Tab installed). hang wasn't reproducible with or without extensions installed.

scruffyagent: would you please test the site with a clean profile (see http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_Manager ). If you don't crash, please try adding your addons back one at a time.

Also, can you confirm that you don't get the Firefox crash reporter, nor the windows error reporting tool? That's quite unusual I think.
