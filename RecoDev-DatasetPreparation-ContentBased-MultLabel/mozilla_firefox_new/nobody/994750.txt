Without ";" this line [1] looks bad in any case. %)

I'm afraid this is not the correct fix! The following would probably be better:

```css
.subviewbutton.panel-subview-footer,
.subviewbutton.panel-subview-footer > .toolbarbutton-text {
  color: hsl(0,0%,25%);
}
```

and remove the line you removed already in this patch.

But before you submit a new patch, I'd like to know why the color value above is not inherited by the button label on Linux. Could you investigate that?

BTW, omitting the semicolon on the last statement in a style definition block is legal syntax and often used by CSS minifiers to shave off a few bytes.

Screenshots (xfce-dusk)

Excuse me, but I think that you didn't understand the problem. Can you look on
screenshots in attachment? I think history footer should looks like bookmarks
footer. Am I right in this part?

However, I agreed that my v1 patch looks too bad. I made another. %)

Yes, it should.
This bug was fixed in bug 1081071. Not sure what to do with this bug.
