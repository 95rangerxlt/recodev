If I open some RSS feed in Firefox (for example http://sunnysoft.cz/obchod/rss.php) and want to subscribe it with external application, nothing happens. Instead of it I get some errors in FeedConverter.js

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://sunnysoft.cz/obchod/rss.php
2. Click to "Subscribe now" (if you have already set external RSS reader application)

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, but in error console I have this: 

Error: [Exception... "ServiceManager::GetService returned failure code:"  nsresult: "0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///opt/firefox/components/FeedConverter.js :: FRS_addToClientReader :: line 297"  data: no]

Expected Results:  
External application should be executed.

It's only Linux related (I have tested it on Windows and it works well there)

Yes, it's failing when getting the shell service because GNOME integration isn't functional on builds from Tinderbox. :(

See bug 268314 for more information. I guess we can add this to bryner's list of things that this affects in comment 0.


Fixed by bug 268314.
unfortunately, it seem like bug is still present in 20060811 BonEcho/2.0b1
(using KDE as desktop environment)
Jindrich, I think this may be due to us not having a shell service for KDE. Please file a new bug with appropriate information, including any errors in the JS Console, and do CC me.
Argh, I just realized you were the reporter of this bug, Jindrich. Apologies. 

Then yes, this is failing because we can't get the shell service on KDE because we don't have one. I'm pretty sure there are bugs filed on this, and other KDE/qt integration bugs. If you can't find one, please do file one.


Subscribing to feed with external application doesn't work (bug in FeedConverter.js ?)
