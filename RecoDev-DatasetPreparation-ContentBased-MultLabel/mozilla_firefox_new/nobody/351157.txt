With these images I tried to achieve:

- smoother border
- new light background
- change the background gradient on active state in order to look pressed
Changing target milestone to increase chance of showing up on search queries.

I'm not convinced by the before/after mockups.  The after appearance on Luna is significantly worse, while the after appearance on Classic is better in some ways (no bizarre white line around button) but worse in others (buttons are almost invisible now).

I think the endcaps would look better if we styled the textfields non-natively as well, to make them look more like the flat Luna look on Classic.  Making a set of endcap images that look good on Luna and Classic as-is seems almost impossible.

Well, it's lighter (I guess that's what you mean) and thus closer to the initial mockup (which I liked). Maybe just my taste, don't know ...

Yeah, I know. I'm open to suggestions how to improve this without significantly changing the look on bright themes like Luna.

Or did you mean the real Luna? I'm asking because my screenshot is from the Royale theme, which doesn't use Luna's beige.

Um... the top was before, right?  The top Go button is lighter than the bottom one, which is dimmer, which is what I didn't like.

Maybe the buttons can be made to look good by using a light highlight only around the right/bottom sides, which would match the highlighting used by Windows Classic's bevels.  Then they would probably look less out of place on Classic while still having some kind of highlight in Luna?

Okay, I tried to fix that. New images coming.

There are two borders, a bright and a dark one, plus they are rounded ... I don't think it's possible to make them look like Classic bevels without trashing the look in Luna. At least I don't know how to do this. Painting the bright border on 2 instead of 4 sides probably wouldn't be enough.

I think this would be acceptable. Fixing top and bottom border widths to 1px could already be enough. But to be sure, I'd have to see this in action. Unfortunately, I didn't get it to work. I guess it's possible and since I'm new to XUL, somebody else might be more successful.

Forget that. I thought the text box would be 2px higher than the endcaps. But at least in the Search bar, that's not the case. It just looks out of place because the border _colors_ don't match.

See also attachment 236722 for some more v2 screenshots with the proposed "not completely native" textfields (using ThreeDShadow as border-color).
Peter (or anybody else), if you think v2 still looks worse, please let me know, otherwise please confirm this bug.

I still don't think it's as good as the old images on Luna (looks very flat).  I think it's a bit better on Classic.  I'll confirm, but I'm not sold :)
This seems like aesthetic twiddling which won't garner a clear consensus, and we're not going to block on that sort of debate.

Well, that's something I can work on. I don't want it to look flat, I just want to fix the aliased corners and the bad integration when the theme is dark.

v3 doesn't really work with very dark OS themes. (see last one in attachment 237109)

The screenshots (v3) for other themes (except very dark) look much much better than the current state. It will be great if you can solve the problem for very dark themes, but even if not, we should definitely land this patch. 

Even for very dark themes, this patch looks better than the current state, if not perfect. 

And this will solve the problem I just filed in Bug 351790
*** Bug 351790 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
There are some new end caps that look much better. They are still not perfect (aliased corners), but it's less visible due to the lower opacity. I think it's good enough and I doubt it will be changed again in this bug.

The final images are even better (close to v2, actually).
-> fixed
