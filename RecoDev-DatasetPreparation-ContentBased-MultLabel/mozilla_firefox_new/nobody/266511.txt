The Import Wizard that appears when starting Firefox for the first time doesn't
display what items (bookmarks, cookies, browsing history, etc.) are being
imported (2nd screen of wizard), nor does it display the items that were
successfully imported (3rd screen of wizard).

This seems to have regressed between the 2004-10-05 and the 2004-10-14 branch
builds.

This problem occurs regardless of which browser to import data and settings from
(IE, Mozilla 1.x or Netscape 6/7, Netscape 4.x).

However, the Import Wizard works as expected when invoking it from File | Import.

*** Bug 267899 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Verified fixed on the 2004-11-05 branch build (build ID: 2004110506)
Reopening.  When starting Firefox for the first time, Import Wizard doesn't show
what's being imported (wizard screen 2).  But it does show what was successfully
imported (wizard screen 3).

As in comment #3, this doesn't occur when invoking from File | Import from main
browser window or Bookmarks Manager.

Reproduced on 2005-01-02 trunk build.
It's ver bad ui ("migrating" items are bold briefly), but there are quite a few bugs filed just for that. The issue reported in this bug was fixed long ago.

Closing.


Import Wizard doesn't show what items were imported
