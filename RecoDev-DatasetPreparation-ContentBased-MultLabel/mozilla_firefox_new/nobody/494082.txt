I noticed that if you leave your Library window open in the background and you surf the web, Shiretoko will occasionally freeze up and become unresponsive for 1-2 seconds at a time. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Shiretoko.
2. Click on History->Show All History.
3. Leave Library window open in the background.
Actual Results:  
Shiretoko will freeze up or "pause" and become unresponsive while actively surfing the web.

Expected Results:  
Shiretoko shouldn't freeze while surfing when the Library window is open.

heh, you have history open and while surfing you are adding visits. i agree it should not freeze.
How does 3.0 performs?
Oh, I know there is lots of stuff happening in that Window while I'm surfing. :) It just shouldn't freeze because it doesn't freeze while the Library is closed and it's still adding data to it.  I checked another computer in the house with 3.0.10 installed on it and the problem is present there as well.
if Library is closed we are not updating history in Library...
To be clear what is slow is not actually adding a visit, but showing that visit in the UI.
*** Bug 497061 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
this is a problem also for bookmarks results, from bug 497061:

Steps to Reproduce:
First Version:

1. Put a very large number of bookmarks into the Unsorted Bookmark Folder. 
Make sure they have Visit Dates.
2. Add the Visit Date column and sort on it so the recently visited bookmarks
are on top.
3. Leaving bookmark manager open Double click on one of these bookmarks (might
need to be something besides most recent one).
---

Tag Version

1. On clean profile restore JSON bookmark backup with a very large number of
bookmarks under some tag (my test had 324).
2. Open Organize Bookmarks and select tag.  After long delay as in Bug 497055
see list of bookmarks with that tag.
3. Sort on Visit Date (most recent on top?)
4. Double click one of the bookmarks
Actual Results:  
Firefox Pauses/Freezes (probably just takes super long time) after loading the
bookmarked page.
freezes are not critical, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html#importance
(In reply to comment #6)
> freezes are not critical

If that is true, then you guys need to update the new bug page @ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided.  At the bottom it says in the Severity field: "Critical: The software crashes, hangs, or causes you to lose data."
Your right, that page does need to be updated. Please use https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html#importance for reference.

According to comment 2, this bug is present in 3.0.x so it's not a regression. We'll consider a fix for 1.9.1.x, but it's not truly "wanted" there.
Mak, don't think this blocks, as it requires a pretty non-standard setup, but we should probably fix it for Firefox 3.6 if it's not too hard to do.
probably bug 498130 can help a lot.
Who can retest now that bug 498130 is landed?
Asaf, I have Build 20091003042919 of Minefield installed, the Library is open with the Today History showing, and I'm going form page to page with no lag and no hangs or freezes. Looks good. I would however keep this bug open for a bit so I can play around with it some more over the weekend. Thanks.
I'm going to go ahead and resolve this as fixed since it looks like bug 498130 fixed this issue. I haven't had any more problems since it landed.
