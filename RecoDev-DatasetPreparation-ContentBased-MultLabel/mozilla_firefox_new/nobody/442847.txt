Selection position is off by up to half a character when a paragraph is justified.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open attached testcase.
2. Pick a paragraph and try to select a single '2' character.
3. Roughly find out the rightmost position from which you can drag your mouse towards the right to select this particular character.
4. Repeat for all paragraphs.
Actual Results:  
Paragraphs colored green behave normally: you can select any character as long as you started dragging the mouse left of its central axis, and finished dragging it right of this axis.

The paragraph colored red behaves incorrectly: the axis used to determine if the character is selected is skewed almost half a character to the left.

testcase
This still occurs on trunk...
I encountered this bug on http://www.dpreview.com/news/1006/10062401sdassociationsdxcsdhc.asp : it could depend on your OS or fonts, but when I try to select any of the first two occurrences of "UHS-I" in the first paragraph I end up selecting only "HS-I" unless I start selecting to the left of the "U".

Also, I can reproduce the problem with the testcase using Firefox 3.6.6 (on Windows).
As noted in bug 511620 and bug 452266, the problem becomes even more obvious if you turn caret browsing on: the caret lies to the left of the desired position in the testcase.

Note that in the fourth paragraph of the testcase, the cursor is correctly positioned from the start of the <p> to the end of the <span> element.
The problem is fixed on trunk, please close the bug.
Fixed on trunk by bug 503399.
