If you click on a 'Browse' button from an INPUT-field (type:file) the file-selection dialog opens. While this, firefox won't do anything and the whole application waits for the dialog to be closed.

Problem especially is mad while running a flash in a different tab streaming music/videos.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stream a music-video using flash (youtube.com)
2. Open a different tab containing a file-upload formular (phpmyadmin, import-sql in my case)
3. Clicked on "browse" to select a file - 'file select' window opened
Actual Results:  
The streamed music in the parallel running tab (.flv video stream) stopped running. Also all tabs will stop everything like JavaScript or loading/displaying content.

Expected Results:  
The flash shouldn't stop. Maybe even the browser should still be able to be used at all. Maybe someone follows a tutorial and wants to check which file he has to upload.

I don't know if this problem is limited to windows. But for me the solution for this problem seems to be a full replacement of the Windows-API-call, finding an alternate method for file selection or running the call in a parallel thread.

Should also note that I only tried it running the newest Firefox 3 Beta.
Dupe of bug 191691 (which is still UNCO)?
I don't think he is asking for the dialog to be non-modal, just that
events aren't processed.  Bug 389931 should fix that.
Tested with Flash movie on YouTube, (per steps):

FF v2 does not have this bug,
then it's not a bug 257121 duplicate.


[Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9b4pre) Gecko/2008022604 Minefield/3.0b4pre] (nightly) (W2Ksp4)

R.Fixed, by bug 389931.
(Assuming it was a bug 326723 regression.)
