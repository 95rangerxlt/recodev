Hello,

that the suggestions get hidden is the normal behavior of this field.
you can see this on all Versions of Firefox.

but I can confirm, that the click is no more moving to the position that you click on.

Not a regression caused by the new search UI; I've just verified that the bug can also be reproduced with the old UI. The same bug also exists with the location bar.
This was fixed by bug 1102050
