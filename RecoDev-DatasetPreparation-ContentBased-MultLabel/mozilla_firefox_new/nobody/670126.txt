I don't exactly know how and why, but on the last aurora-beta migration, we lost the state of shipped-locales, in particular, 'vi' is not in there anymore.

a) update shipped-locales
b) update the migration process to prevent this
c) can we recover the 'vi' b1 build?

I'm going to yank Vi out of product-details for b1 and we'll just pick it up in b2
I assume you meant to set build config as component.
Unclear what RelEng to do here, but commenting after irc investigation after beta meeting.

1) This bug needs a reviewed patch. 

2) I see no need to manually generate a 6.0b1 "vi" out-of-sync with the rest of 6.0b1. Instead, once this patch is landed on beta, the next 6.0betaN release will include the "vi" locale, as well as updates for "vi" users on older versions on beta. 

3) The bug summary talks about "vi", but comment#0 says "we lost the state of shipped-locales", which contains a lot of locales. Are any other locales impacted?
Re 1), http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/e25c5612ad5c, shipped-locales has special tree rules by drivers.

Re 3), we lost a ton of patches, some of which removed locales, and some added, the net difference of those was the loss of 'vi'.

We need to still document that we need to keep the shipped-locales state intact during the merges, as well as all-locales. Should that go into the checklist wiki page, or into the merge mechanics on github?

I've checked on http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/6.0b2-candidates/ and the 'vi' build is present.

Not quite sure why bug has the "New" status. Are there any other patches that need to be uploaded?
