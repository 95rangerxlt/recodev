When I'm typing a gmail message (new or replying) and click outside the textarea, all logical lines that have the spell-check dotted red underline have their text disappear, as does the logical line with the caret.

The dotted red underline remains visible, though.  I can reproduce this 100% of the time at gmail (Bon Echo a3, XP SP2), though I haven't yet found another textarea that does the same thing.

I lie like a rug.  I thought I had an a3 build on this machine, because Check for Updates had nothing, and I forgot that we didn't push updates for a2->a3 (still? ever? dunno).

Works in a3, FIXED, sorry for the noise.


when textarea is defocused, lines with spell-check marker or caret disappear (gmail)
