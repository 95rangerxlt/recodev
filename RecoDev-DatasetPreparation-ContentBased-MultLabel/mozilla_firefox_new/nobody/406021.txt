Check the screenshot. In Windows Classic mode, the URL bar and search bar looks strange, like it's trying to be 3D but failing.

Do you mean the textfields themselves or the favicon and search engine boxes?
Morphing bug to cover the fact that the left hand side of the address bar and the left hand side of the search bar doesn't really fit.

I wonder if it will perhaps upset themers that overriding that image will affect both the tab bar and location bar?

For some reason that I don't fully understand, this styling doesn't apply to the button when there's a search engine to install (e.g. at any site that has an advertised search plugin, technorati.com and b.m.o).

I can't think of such an image for the tabs that would look totally out of place for these button-like elements in the nav toolbar. I guess many themers don't particularly care about Windows Classic, so this would just work out of the box (and could therefore be considered a feature). Those who do care can change it easily.
Alternatively, we could package the same image twice or rename the existing image to something more generic. Doesn't really sound appealing to me.

Could it be that you accidentally added the background image to |.searchbar-engine-button > .button-box| rather than |.searchbar-engine-button|? |.searchbar-engine-button[addengines="true"] > .button-box| is where we add the blue coma, which would replace a previously set background image.

address bar now with rounded end

Still doesn't look right to me dao. The inside bevel color is missing (compare the left hand side of the search bar).
Yes, it's round as per bug 414183. We don't draw the inside bevel because the theme code doesn't know about your OS theme. We could handle Windows 2000 as a special case, but that doesn't help Win XP/Vista Classic, which are more important targets.
Yes, I filed this bug against win2k, but I'm on XP now (where the screenshot was taken from).


Using classic mode in windows, left hand side of address/URL bar and search bar look wrong
