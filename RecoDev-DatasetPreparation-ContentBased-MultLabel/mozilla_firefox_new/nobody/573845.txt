Currently, the console opens at a fixed height, which is not good for smaller screens.

summary:     Bug 573845 - open the console to a percentage of the browser window height, p=ddahl, r=dietrich
Be nice use a clickable url:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/99d7167794ff

> +    var height = Math.ceil((this.contentWindow.innerHeight * .33)) + "px";

Pity you can't use CSS3 -moz-calc() here

> +    var style = "height: " + height + ";";
> +    this.HUDBox.setAttribute("style", style);

Perhaps this.HUDBox.style.setProperty("height", height, null);

Eventually, we should use some slick animated slide-down:)

is the height property the preferred method here?

I believe the technical term is "voop". :)

well, it's more direct than constructing a string containing the style at the expense of further indirection. You might also need a null check on this.HUDBox.style before doing the above.

IMO, what you submitted is adequate.

AFAIK element.style should always exist as it is in the IDL.

nono! I liked the suggestion, it's just that we've checked this in already and had a review on it. Feel free to file a follow-up patch and we can get it in.
