Screenshot showing missing icon

After updating from 7.0a2 to 8.0xx on the Aurora channel, the icon for the "Get Bookmark Add-Ons" menu entry went missing. It should have been a blue circle with a white cross. Instead there is the (IMHO butt-ugly) default favicon.

Bug also present on current mozilla-central, on Ubuntu 11.04 x64.
that bookmark is just a leftover, if you create a new profile it should not be there
Shouldn't the entry be removed on updating then? The way it is now, pretty much all users will be left with that "hole". Either the entry and icon or removed, or neither. Removing one and not the other makes little sense.
This just fixed itself in Aurora, possibly due to bug 675416.


Get Bookmark Add-Ons is missing icon
