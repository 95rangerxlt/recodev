https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/print-edit
From the developer, here is the current status:

recently started updating when print functionality became available in Firefox Nightly â€“ substantial update required
Print Edit was first updated to work in e10s windows in Version 13.0 (2014-12-02), which worked with Nightly 36.0a1.  Since then, Print Edit has been updated regularly to keep in step with the e10s printing/previewing changes, and also to fix bugs and implement new features.

Following the completion of the work to implement the e10s printing/previewing functionality (bugs 1088070 & 1136855), Print Edit has been updated to Version 15.2. This version is fully compatible with the latest e10s printing/previewing functionality in Nightly 39.0a1 and any workarounds that are no longer necessary have been removed.

Print Edit 15.2 was released today and supports all versions of Firefox from 4.0 to 39.0a1.

As far as I am concerned, this bug can now be closed.
Thanks!
