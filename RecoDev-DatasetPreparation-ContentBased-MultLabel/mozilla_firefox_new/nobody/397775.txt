Nonbreakable space (U+00A0) should not have fixed width. The size should be as elastic as normal inter-word (U+0020) space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Render line-wrapped justifed text containing &nbsp;.
Actual Results:  
The &nbsp; has different width than other spaces on the same line.

Expected Results:  
&nbsp; has the same width as other spaces on the same line.

This is regression between Firefox 2.0.0.7 and Firefox 3.0 (alpha9).
