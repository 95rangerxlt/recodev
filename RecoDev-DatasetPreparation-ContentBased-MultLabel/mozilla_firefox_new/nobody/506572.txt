In FX3 one could drag a tab to the desktop / an explorer window to create a shortcut to the URL of a page. This doesn't work anymore in FX3.5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag a tab from a Firefox tab bar to the desktop / an explorer window.
2. No shortcut is created (this worked in FX3).
Actual Results:  
No shortcut is created, like before. It was very convenient. It's now even more important to fix this bug, since creating links by dragging the icon from the identity box in the location bar doesn't always work (for SSL encrypted pages it doesn't, see bug report 506571).

Expected Results:  
A newly created shortcut to the URL of the page in the dragged tab.
