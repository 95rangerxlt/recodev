Thunderbird (v 3.0.3) email links are inoperative after upgrading to Firefox 3.6.4 yesterday.  Clicking on the link, right-mouse "Open Link in Browser" do not start a new tab and open the link in Firefox.  I need to copy the link and paste it into the Firefox URL bar.

Links from XChat will open correctly if right-mouse "Open Link in Browser" or "Open URL in Web Browser" are clicked, but clicking on the link itself does nothing.

I have seen recent forum entries of this same issue on various OS platforms and email clients.

I tried Firefox in --safe-mode but the problem is still there.

I followed both notices on setting Firefox as my default email client and internet application.  Still have the problem.

I de-installed Firefox and re-intalled via YUM.  Still have the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.6.4
2. Open Thunderbird email client
3. click on a hyperlink within an email
Actual Results:  
nothing happens

Expected Results:  
previous version of Firefox would open a new tab with the contents of the email hyperlink.

I have tested this only with Thunderbird and XChat external clients, but I expect it is more widespread than this.

I downgraded to Firefox 3.5.10 and email links work as expected.  This is definitely an issue introduced with the 3.6.4 upgrade.
After using Firefox 3.5.10 via the file system (not installed via rpm) and ending the browser session, I started up 3.6.4 once more.  Presto, email links now work.  3.5.10 said that firefox was not my default email client, so I set it.  3.6.4 did not subsequently ask me.

In short, this is no longer a problem for me, but may be for others.  An rpm re-install of 3.6.4 did not help.  But running a 3.5.10 Firefox, ending it, then starting 3.6.4 fixed the problem.  The rpm migration path must have some little thing missing.

weird problem, long time to resolve.  

I will close the problem.
one last note: I started 3.6.4 by command line the first time after running 3.5.10 and I got this message:

*** NSPlugin Viewer  *** WARNING: unhandled variable 18 (<unknown variable>) in NPN_GetValue()


subsequent starts of 3.6.4 did not show this message.
I am reopening this problem.  After a reboot it is back.
I installed 3.6.6 today.  This no longer appears to be a problem.

Closing.


since upgrading to Firefox 3.6.4, links within Thunderbird email do not work
