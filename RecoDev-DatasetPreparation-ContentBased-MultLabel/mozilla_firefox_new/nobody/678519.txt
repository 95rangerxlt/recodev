For example:
> hel<TAB>

Should complete to:
> help_|

(i.e. there needs to be a space added as part of the completion because:
- That saves keypresses
- It's what zsh/bash etc do
- otherwise the cursor is inside the 'command' and we provide help for the command rather than what's next

However:
> eval window.docu<TAB>

Using the same logic we should complete to:
> eval window.document_|

However this is really annoying because it's likely that the user want's to continue typing, digging into document.
We need to support this way of doing things because:
- this is what Firebug/webkit inspector etc do.
- completing too much is really annoying


To further complicate things:
> eval window.document.titl<TAB>

Clearly in this case we need the space added.

GCLI needs to distinguish between sufficient completions and insufficient ones
