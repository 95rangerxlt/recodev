On Windows when the user closes their last normal tab (and they have one or more app tabs open), the tab strip shifts by a single pixel.
For 200% more fun, remove all the toolbar buttons from the tab bar, then close the last normal tab (while an app tab is open)!
The app tabs completely overlap with the nav bar.

This occurs because we are using Dao's proposed method of fixing the app tabs to the left by setting CSS position: fixed on them. This takes them out of the layout, so their box height is no longer affecting their container's size.

This works fine on Mac, because we have the following line in browser/skin/browser.css:
.tabbrowser-tabs { height: 25px; }

I propose that we fix this similarly for Windows by adding the following line to browser/skin/browser.css:
.tabbrowser-tabs { height: 24px; }

I'll post a patch that does just that.

Fixed for Linux too.

This isn't quite right, since the tab bar won't always have this height (depends on the font size for instance). Bug 582950 should have fixed this, anyway.

Not sure why browser.css for OS X is using .tabbrowser-tabs { height: 25px; } then.

Resolving, since the issue was fixed by the patch in bug 582950.

It can help to keep the tab bar height constant in different situations, e.g. when you remove buttons. It's not the only way to do it and not necessarily the best one.


Navigation toolbar moves a pixel when last normal tab is closed
