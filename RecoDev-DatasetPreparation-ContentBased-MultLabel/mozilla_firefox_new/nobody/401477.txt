In some cases, Firefox can not be started anymore because one page saved in the session will crash it (due for example to a bug like bug 400735)

There should be an option in safe mode to disable Session Restore.
Or even, Firefox could just not do Session Restore in Safe Mode.


See also bug 347680.
In fact, the feature here is about being able to ignore the Startup setting of Firefox and load a blank page at startup in Safe Mode, instead of the home page or of "windows and tabs from the last time" in order to be able to start reliably if it is those pages that cause the crash.

Bug 347680 is about the reverse, when you recover from a crash, automatically suggest to go in safe mode.

The core issue should be fixed by bug 451292 by making sure that you get the Session Restore prompt after a crash right at startup.
FIXED by the combination of bug 459593 and bug 451292 (crashy sessions are now always detected as such and never automatically restored in Safe Mode).


Safe Mode should have an option to disable Session Restore
