Good -https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/d6059530b0317e6f6b141582b611469505256be4

Bad - https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/ab65cc1341892ab941b4da3e83b6210b6068ac88


Actual results:

A large portion of Bookmarks are 'missing' as are almost all of them in the Bookmarks dropdown Menu, in the Sidebar and in the Library.  Also some add-ons don't seem to work whose icons are also on the Bookmarks bar.


Expected results:

Bookmarks should appear and add-ons should work.

Should read that the Bookmark Favicons are missing...  Bookmarks seem to be intact, just missing Favicons and displaying only the 'generic' icon for many of your bookmarks.

Confirming, setting to NEW
Problem appears to be caused by the add-on OmniSidebar.

I don't have that addon, nor any that would affect bookmarks or tabs.

maybe it's something due to the automated changes in bug 1202902, since anything else doesn't look related.
Any errors in the browser console?

I'm not sure about "missing bookmarks/icons" as I don't see anything of the sort. For me the sidebar doesn't work at all, which was expected with bug 1202902. At least as far as OmniSidebar is concerned, beta version 1.6.6b1 [1] should work properly.

Gary, can you check if that fixes everything, or am I missing something about the missing bookmarks part?

Yep that fixed it for me.
Fixed everything, sidebar, bookmark bar favicons, etc.
Cool. Bug 1202902 was temporarily backed out recently as well, so that should give me time before it actually gets to Nightly to also upload that fix to my other add-ons.

Add-on developers should be notified of this, as it affects their bootstrap.js [1]. Leaving needinfo for :shu for now so this isn't skipped over; bug 1202902 breaks the world and beyond. ;)

Just noticed that the icons for all my add-ons are the same.  The generic blue puzzle piece. I recall that all the icons were different.  I am on a new hourly inbound, the latest.  Wonder if that is causing this.  Also my add-on FlashStopper doesn't have  it's icon on my bookmarks bar and also doesn't work anymore.
