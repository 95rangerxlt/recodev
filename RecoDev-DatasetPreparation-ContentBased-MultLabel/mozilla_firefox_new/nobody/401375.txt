http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/locales/en-US/chrome/places/places.properties#3 references chrome://browser/skin/places/bookmarksMenu.png from toolkit code, though that file is not available for non-Firefox toolkit users.

I wonder why this is in L10n files anyways, but apart from that, we shouldn't require Firefox-specific things in toolkit code.

Fixed by bug 387746
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
