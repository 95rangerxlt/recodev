Build ID: 20151022152545

Steps to reproduce:

Installed https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/private-tab/

Typed private:http://example.org/ in the address bar and pressed enter.


Actual results:

Nothing.


Expected results:

The tab should be converted by the Private Tab extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/private-tab/). 

Its private: pseudo-protocol worked fine until the Firefox 42 Beta 9 update.

If it still worked in 42.0b8, then it's still likely due to bug 1214122 / http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/e1261e250e85

Jorge, should this bug be closed as invalid and the developer be informed about the issue?

From the browser console:

A promise chain failed to handle a rejection. Did you forget to '.catch', or did you forget to 'return'?

Sebastian, I've already reported it here: https://github.com/Infocatcher/Private_Tab/issues/190

But if you close this issue, please tell the developer there what exactly he must do to fix it.
It's likely and invalid bug, but someone should confirm this isn't problem in Firefox. It looks like the dev was already notified via github.

As I noticed on GitHub, this is strange: looks like all already fixed in latest aurora and nightly.
But what will be in the next beta/release?
Seems to be https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1214786#c24 which will be included in the Firefox 42 RC builds which should be releases in ~24 hours.
This has been fixed on https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/42.0/win64/


Firefox 42.0b9 broke "private:" pseudo-protocol  used by the Private Tab extension

addon-compat, regression
