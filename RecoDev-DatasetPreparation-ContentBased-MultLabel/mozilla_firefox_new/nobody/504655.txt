If I press CTRL-Insert with text selected, the clipboard is unaffected. (What I intended to copy is not copied, but the clipboard is not cleared either.) This happens with both displayed text and text within a text entry box (like this one). SHIFT-Insert does paste, just as it should.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select text on a page or within a text entry box
2. Press CONTROL and Insert
3. Paste in Notepad and see what you tried to copy was not copied
Actual Results:  
Nothing that I can see. The text is not copied, but the clipboard is not cleared either.


Theme = Phoenity Reborn 0.8.358
I used this theme in 3.0.11 and CTRL-Ins worked correctly.

I have determined the problem was caused by VirtualBox and not a bug in Firefox.


CTRL-Insert does not copy to clipboard
