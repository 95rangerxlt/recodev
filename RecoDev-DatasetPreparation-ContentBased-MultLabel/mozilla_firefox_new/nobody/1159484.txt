We're seeing a large number of crashes for Firefox 37.0.X that seem to be caused by Trusteer Rapport. Crashes seem to be intermittent but frequent.

See: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1059387

Here are some crashes:

for osx crashes

More interesting: These are almost all on 37.0.1 and 37.0.2 but seemed to only show up this weekend and be getting worse so it may not be tied to the Firefox update.

Open questions for Trusteer: 

- Was there an update for Trusteer that was pushed out this weekend or Monday morning? If so, do we know the number of users who have it already and the number who do not but expect to get it soon?

- Is there a known issue with Trusteer and Firefox 37.0.2 that needs to be resolved? What is the fastest way to push out that change.

There seems to be a new version, http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/unexpected-kernel-mode-trap-bsod-on-windows-81/e9f7b1ea-8567-437f-8096-4ceff443fa4b mentions new drivers, e.g. RapportKE64.sys and RapportCerberus.dll. The new version is 3.5.1412.149, see http://www.herdprotect.com/rapportcerberus.dll-763e244dd0dd4fb2fda62c8c7ca1712a782c759d.aspx

The installer (RapportSetup.exe) I downloaded from http://www-01.ibm.com/software/security/trusteer/ is still 3.5.1404.84 (one month old).
Here's an IRC snippet from yesterday concerning this:

<Tyler> KaiRo, lmandel ping. I've seen a massive spike in users complaining about a few crashes today. They all seem related to MessagePump

<Tyler> https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/a9a493b8-a24c-4f5d-9a5a-089f42150427
<Tyler> Firefox crashes in safe mode, not sure what's causing this
<Tyler> all using 37.0.2
<Tyler> Cww, marksc ^^ Just an FYI
<Tyler> By massive, this is like 10 users on the forums just today, which is pretty massive ;)
<KaiRo> RapportTanzan370.DLL in the modules list at least for the first one, sounds familiar ;-)
<Tyler> Think they pushed an update?
<KaiRo> Tyler: I definitely would start the search for a reason there, maybe we need to contact Trusteer/IBM
Adding the signatures of those crashes, all of them contain this module:
RapportTanzan370.DLL 	3.5.1404.84 	D0730295B2D74A309FAA1E32177FEF931 	Rapporttanzan370.pdb
I sent the following request to IBM Trusteer support today:

Hello,

This past weekend we (Mozilla) started receiving feedback about new crashes with Firefox 37.0.1 and 37.0.2 that appear to be related to Trusteer Rapport. (We did not push any changes to Firefox this past weekend.)

The details are in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1159484

Questions from the bug report:

1. Was there an update for Trusteer that was pushed out this weekend or Monday morning? If so, do we know the number of users who have it already and the number who do not but expect to get it soon?

2. Is there a known issue with Trusteer and Firefox 37.0.2 that needs to be resolved? What is the fastest way to push out that change?

Thank you,

Lawrence Mandel
Hi.
Thank you for contacting us. We are handling the issues raised here and we will start releasing a fix gradually to the field today (we expect it to arrive to the entire population in few days).
In such situations in the future, in addition to contacting our support team, please feel free to contact the engineering team directly at :
ilanf@il.ibm.com
and
eldan@il.ibm.com

Best Regards,
Ilan.
Toda Ilan. If you can comment back in this bug to let us know once the fix has been released we will monitor Firefox crash data to ensure that this signature is no longer being reported.
I sent a follow-up e-mail to Ilan asking about the new release of Rapport today.
The fix has been released. I think you can see this also in your stats :
For example if you look at https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/list?date=2015-05-26&range_unit=days&range_value=7&signature=nsBaseAppShell%3A%3AOnProcessNextEvent%28nsIThreadInternal%2A%2C+bool%2C+unsigned+int%29+%7C+nsThread%3A%3AProcessNextEvent%28bool%2C+bool%2A%29+%7C+mozilla%3A%3Aipc%3A%3AMessagePump%3A%3ARun%28base%3A%3AMessagePump%3A%3ADelegate%2A%29#tab-reports
Then in the last 14 days you have 1090 reports, in the last 7 days you have 140 reports and in the last 3 days you have 36 reports.
All the numbers listed in comment 8 are now about half over the same periods. Looks like this is fixed and we're seeing the update continue to roll out.
