border-image-slice: 1; is missing from https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#1899 , which is causing the start border not to show.

A side-note: It may be worth moving these urlbar button related rules into a shared file.

Just adding that isn't enough, though, because it shows a border to the right of the reload/stop/go button as well, as noted on bug 1185960:

That and the spacing between the buttons just looks wrong on OS X (attachment 8657888). Not sure what's up with that.
This was taken care of in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/ec99f1dfd668
