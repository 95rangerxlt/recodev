Enabling the "FindBar Tweak" add-on now disables the "layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation" pref, breaking double-click text selection on OS X.

STR:
1. Install FindBar Tweak addon:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/findbar-tweak/
2. Double-click a word in the address bar URL.

RESULT:
The entire URL is selected instead of just the word double-clicked. Other FindBar Tweak functionality seems to have stopped working recently and may be related to this problem.

I bisected this regression to the following pushlog, which backs out three billm bugs. So backing out these bugs seems to have *caused* this FindBar Tweak problem?!

Please try the latest version 2.1.2 in the queue: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/findbar-tweak/versions/. It has many bugfixes, including a critical one for use in the latest Nightly builds. If that doesn't help please read on, otherwise ignore the rest.

I don't understand what this has to do with FBT. The add-on provides a shortcut for this preference in its preferences dialog (under Tweaks - "Double-clicking on a word stops selection at punctuation"), but that's it. It doesn't do anything with it, it just has a checkbox to toggle it. Are you sure you didn't just toggle it yourself and forgot about it?

I also can't reproduce it. Text selection works fine for me, according to the state of that preference.

FWIW, the first time I tried today, I had the add-on _disabled_ (by chance I left it disabled from yesterday), and text selection _wasn't_ stopping at punctuation! I enabled the add-on and selection still didn't stop at punctuation, despite the add-on's checkbox for this preference being clearly checked. I then unchecked the checkbox, selection didn't stop at punctuation as expected, then rechecked the checkbox and now everything works fine. No matter how I start or restart firefox, with or without the add-on, text selection stopping at punctuation reflects the state of layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation.

I should have checked layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation directly in about:config when text selection wasn't respecting it at first, instead of just the add-on's checkbox (which goes through a dummy preference, in order to be able to revert changes on uninstall). So it's hard to say whether it's a problem with the add-on or Firefox itself with absolute certainty. _But_ the add-on has a similar checkbox shortcut for layout.word_select.eat_space_to_next_word which uses the exact same underlying dummy routine, and that was working as expected right from the start: its checkbox was checked and text selection was selecting the following space; I made sure to also test this before I toggled either of those prefs. This leads me to conclude that it's not really a problem with the add-on, if there is a problem at all.

I'm also positive this has nothing to do with e10s. That part of the code (add-on) doesn't touch anything e10s-related, so unless Firefox's text selections functions themselves are affected by e10s, this probably shouldn't be tracked (and it they are affected by e10s, then I'm certain it has nothing to do with the add-on).
When I open FBT's Preferences in Nightly 44, the about:findbartweak page is empty except for a "Preferences" button and a "Jump to preference..." input box. I see the following error message in the browser console:

A promise chain failed to handle a rejection. Did you forget to '.catch', or did you forget to 'return'?

That is the critical bug I mentioned that version 2.1.2 still in the queue fixes. ;)
Luís, I just tested version 2.1.2 and all these problems have been fixed. :)
That's great to hear. Thanks for keeping an eye on the add-on like this as well. :)
