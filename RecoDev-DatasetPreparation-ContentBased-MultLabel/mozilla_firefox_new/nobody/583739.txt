Whenever i try to login on a PHPBB based forum when a cookie from it is present, i just get thrown back to the previous page. Although, through a brief period (2 seconds or so) i'm truly logged in.

If i delete the cookies from the site, it's fine. Until the time i shut the browser down.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to a PHPBB based forum.
2. Shutdown the browser.
3. Fire up the browser and try to login again.
Actual Results:  
Cant login, like described in the details section.

Expected Results:  
Log me in for more than a pulse.

Mentioned in bug 572223 comment 59 too (cookies disappearing in recent builds is bug 583557). But the latest nightly (20100802) should have bug 572223 backed out again, so I don't know if it's related.
Well, the cookies are physically there, but IF they are there, i cant log-in.
And i have tested on today's build, and no still no dice.
Methinks it's been fixed in 20100803.


Cookies broken on PHPBB based forums.
