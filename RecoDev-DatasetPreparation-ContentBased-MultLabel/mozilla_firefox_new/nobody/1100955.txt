Pete, our add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Ally on this bu. MDN also has a good introduction:

Thanks, this is being tracked at https://github.com/sneakypete81/updatescanner/issues/29.
Please try v3.2.2beta2 from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/versions/3.2.2beta2
v3.2.2beta2 works as expected on latest Nightly with e10s.

Thanks! Let's keep this open until the code makes it to a release version that is pushed to all users.
This does appear to be working now. There are some unsafe CPOW warnings, but otherwise seems good.
It is still broken if you try to open link (click on item from update scanner sidebar) on tab which is not empty. For example:
1. open www.google.com
2. click on item from update scanner sidebar
Nothing happened. It must open link from update scanner.

If you open new tab and then click on link from update scanner it works OK. If you have already tab with loaded site from update scanner and click on another link from update scanner it works also OK.
It works for me:

* Install Nightly 2015-10-18
* Create a new profile
* Confirm that about:support shows Multiprocess Windows default=True
* Install Update Scanner v3.2.3
* Restart Nightly
* Open the Update Scanner sidebar and click "Scan"
* Go to http://www.google.co.uk
* Click the "Update Scanner Website" item in the sidebar

@drjeckyll: can you please try the above steps and check whether this works for you?
* 45.0a1 (2015-11-11)
* with new profile it seems to work
* e10s is enabled for sure

With old profile when I click on link I can see error in error console:
Timestamp: 11/11/2015 09:44:06 PM
Error: TypeError: mainWindow.getBrowser(...).selectedBrowser.contentWindow is null
Source File: chrome://updatescan/content/updatescan.js
Line: 448
Does it work with your old profile with e10s turned off? If not then we should move this to a different bug (https://github.com/sneakypete81/updatescanner/issues/).

Next step is to see what it is about your profile that's affecting this. Another addon perhaps, or something in the preferences.

You can either start with the fresh profile and update it to make it the same as your old one (install addons, modify preferences, etc) or vice versa.

Thanks for your help with this.
It works with e10s disabled.

I disabled all other addons and left only update scanner active. Still not working.
ok - I change in _diffItemThisWindow:
mainWindow.getBrowser().selectedBrowser.contentWindow.location.href = diffURL;
to:
openUILinkIn(diffURL, "current");

And now it works. It works also on non e10s windows.
Thanks, that seems like the right thing to do.
I've raised this as https://github.com/sneakypete81/updatescanner/issues/64.
Lets continue any further discussion there.
