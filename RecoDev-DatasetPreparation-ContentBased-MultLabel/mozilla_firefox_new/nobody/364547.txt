Select the 'Bookmarks' -> 'Organize Bookmarks...' menu.
Click on a bookmark.
Press the 'Rename' button in the toolbar.

I have enclosed a snap of the sheet. The problem is that the name of the bookmark item is offset from the left of the field considerably more than the other fields. It appears to be a 3 or 4 pixel difference.


Reproducible: Always
