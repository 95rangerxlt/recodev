In order to increase engagement and retention, the growth team would like the ability to open multiple tabs at first run or after an update.

At first run, the first tab should likely remain focused on FXA sign-in and creation but we could use a second tab to increase stickiness. Here are examples of what we could do with these additional tabs (some inspired by Chrome):
-On Mac, show how to add Firefox to the dock
-On Windows 8, show how to move the launch tile to the 1st page
-In Win 10, we show steps to set us as default browser (it's pretty complicated).

After an update, we could have a tab to promote each new feature or we could remind them to create a FXA account.

Essentially, there are a lot of things we can try and test with the ability to open multiple tabs at first run and after an update.

As an added perk, user studies have demonstrated an important proportion of users are still very unfamiliar with the idea of tabs. If we open multiple tabs at first run, it may familiarize them a bit more.
