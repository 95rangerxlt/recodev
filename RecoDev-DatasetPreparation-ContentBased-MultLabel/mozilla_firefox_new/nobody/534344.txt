Site is almost completely flash based. Animated flash, flash animations consume 50-99% of CPU cycles. I tested with IE and though the animations in flash do indeed play and about the same as in Firefox, IE apparently polices the flash application's use of CPU much better than Firefox does. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Pizzahut.com using Firefox. 
2.Flash animations play. 
3.CPU cycles are consumed such that you cannot click any tabs. 
4.Type control-alt-delete to start task manager, click on processes tab. Click heading of CPU column, firefox comes to top and stays there. 50-99%.
5 Close site in firefox, firefox cpu usage declines. 
6 Go to site in IE, problem does not occur. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes the entire computer while playing flash animations. This might be only flash animations with certain attributes, but I couldn't determine which.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should police the flash application's use of resources.

What version of flash are you using? Why did you put this in Javascript?
I have several versions of flash on several systems, the problem is exhibited on all of them. Some are the latest update. 

I just found another test case
http://trittonusa.com/products/legacy_products/#Legacy_Products
Which is currently using over 50% CPU. 

As to javascript, I suspected that was what was using up the cpu. 
If I am wrong and the problem is elsewhere feel free to correct me.
Can you test on a coputer running flash 10.0 r42 or later in a new clean profile? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing+profiles
This system has Flash 10, on XP Prof. 

On the page
http://trittonusa.com/support/
I haven't been able to figure out what is animating the logo, but that is really taking up cpu. 

I opened that same page in IE 6 and the animation does not occur. The CPU hogging doesn't occur either.
This is flash 10. r32
can you try with r42 or later in a new profile please?
I just created a new profile and went to 

http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/

While that video at adobe.com is playing CPU was at 50% while the rings were coming out of the flash F.  Then declined to a negligible level though the music is still playing as I type this. 

I downloaded new flash from adobe.com and installed it just now. 

I just opened http://trittonusa.com/support/#
and the CPU is at 50-60% while the animation plays. 
The trittonusa.com site doesn't appear to use flash. 
It is difficult to click between this tab and the trittonusa.com tab in firefox while that animation plays. Sitting at 60% now.
As to the flash version, 
Flash info says: 
You have version 10,0,42,34 installed

I have blaring music playing in the other tab from 
http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/
And firefox is at 20% CPU.
OK, the site does use flash. 
Here is the offending flash object. 

http://trittonusa.com/themes/triton/banner_flash%203.swf

It is currently using 72% of CPU.
I just opened the other test case
http://www.pizzahut.com/
And as before, I cannot click any tabs, get menus to work, nothing. 

Interestingly, while 
http://www.pizzahut.com/
tab is selected and the video playing, which seems to be
http://www.pizzahut.com/MM/Home/HomePage.swf
But it won't play by itself, it is using over 60% of CPU. 

If I click another tab, like this bugzilla tab, that CPU usage diminishes. 
I guess unlike the other test case the pizzahut flash is not playing when I click the other tab to front. 

If I click back to the pizzahut tab CPU usage goes to 70% immediately.
I have a feeling this is more a flash issue than I FF one, but cliss can help us with that :)

I am seeing some CPU usuage in the range of 40-50% (varies widely) on pizzahut.com with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091219 Minefield/3.7a1pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) ID:20091219042456
Ya know, I tested this with ff and IE6 at work when I first posted this. 

On pizzahut.com it seemed that IE6 policed flash pretty good. 
It still does use up cpu while playing that video in iexplore.exe. 
It just hit 69% and higher. 
The flash is still playing in iexplore.exe and the cpu is hovering at well, 0%. It does peak sometimes but nothing like firefox. 

Firefox seems to let that flash object just run with abandon. 
The only thing I can think is IE6 it throttling it kind of elegantly.  
It's still playing.....
Well, IE uses a different flash plugin than Firefox, so we can't cross compare very easily there.
Yeah, well, different, and same. The issue is the flash site plays on both browsers but Firefox allows the flash object to essentially steal all the computer horsepower.  

On IE, they have either somehow prevented that, or the architecture and performance of IE is so different from FF that it doesn't seem to matter nearly as much. 

I think the browser should police the plugins use of resources.  Is that possible for Firefox? Heck, *something* needs to police that.
Jonathan, can you take a look at the examples in this bug and see if they can be turned into test cases for out of process plugins?
Another test case.  Not nearly as severe as the pizzahut.com site, in that if you click to another ff tab the cpu usage declines indicating the animation does not continue when the tab is in the back. 

http://skof.co.nz/products

When that site is in front it consumes 98% of CPU. In back, none. 

Interestingly, if you mouse over the rotating products the animation stops, the product you have moused over gets bigger, but the system usage does not decline even while the animation is essentially stopped, which likely means it isn't really stopped.
Another test case. 

http://www.subwayfreshbuzz.com/index.asp?rdr=PartnerSites:FNA:SubwayCom:W2:2010

Site is using 60% or more of CPU when it's in front. 
When the tab is clicked to back like now as I type this, that CPU usage declines to none.  
Click the subwayfreshbuzz.com site to the front (in back on the windows task manager) and the CPU usage climbs.  You can't even click the tabs, I had to try several times before I got the tab to switch.
Another test case. 
This site uses 55% or more of my cpu on task manager while the flash video is playing lazily.  

http://www.sapagroup.com/us/Company-sites/Sapa-Profiles-Inc---Portland/

This is like the last one, when the tab is not in front the cpu usage declines, unlike the pizzahut test case which consumes all available processor whether it is in front or not.
On my Windows 7 box I don't see such severe cpu usage with PizzaHut or the above two links.  What is your system info?   I know Flash Player 10.1 Beta 3 has some great performance enhancements.  Maybe you can try that?
Well, there is a pattern here. 
I just went to another prominent pizza delivery company website. 
http://www.dominos.com/home/index.jsp

They now have several flash objects, and with firefox those flash objects consume 70-90% of CPU.  

As you recall their chief competitor, pizzahut.com had flash objects using up all the CPU before. Now, dominos too.
Another site for testing:

http://www.iqfeed.net/

I know this problem since the first versions of FireFox.

Tested today with latest nightly build 3.7a5pre
Again I am unable to reproduce this with Flash Player 10.1.  Would on of the reports with this problem please help me to confirm that 10.1 does indeed improve the issue.
Tested a few of the sites listed above with 10.1 rc2
Too much CPU is taken.
It is not easy to conclude if there is some improvement or not.

Using both:
Windows 7 64 bit FireFox 3.63 
and Windows XP 32 bit FireFox 3.7a5pre
The http://www.iqfeed.net/
site exhibits this problem severely.  It starts at about 89% of CPU being used and declines to about 57%. 

As to system specs, that is a nonissue.  

I have mostly 3.0 Ghz single core systems, not by any means high performance.  But adequate, and that is what should be tested on.  

Clearly a quad core 64 bit system might not show much of an objectionable problem, but not because the problem doesn't exist, it's just got enough performance to overcome it.   

But firefox is not based on a 6 month old multicore processor with 16 GB ram system requirement.  If everyone had those sloppy programming and idiotic resource usage would not be important. 

But we are testing.  Hiding the problem by throwing processor at it doesn't solve the problem.  The problem is there and it's getting worse, lots worse. Postes other than I have posted sites that show this issue.  

Probably it's getting worse because the programmers who develop these sites have those multicore new computers, like developers often do.  No real surprise there. They can't see the problem.  

Firefox *has to* police the use of system resources by flash and other junky technology.  It's no big surprise there's no flash on Iphones and Ipads. That thing is a pig and behaves terribly. Someone has to keep it in check. Apple is, why not us?
Steve, we aren't worried about your specs. We want to know if you see this with Firefox 3.6.3 or later in a fresh profile with Flash 10.1 or later.
Steve the Flash Player cannot control how people choose to write their applications.  Poor coding is a developer issue across many platforms.  We are interested in understanding this issue but have to reproduce it first.  

Could you please try with Flash Player 10.1 downloadable from labs.adobe.com and let us know what your findings are?
Correction to my last post.
 I just found out that the test page I mentioned above (iqfeed.net) has indeed a problem but the problem is totally unrelated with the flash player sorry for reporting it wrongly first. This is apparently a completely independent issue requiring further investigation as the same page takes near 0% CPU in Chrome and IE.

Note that there is still a Firefox related flash issue as the other sites reported still take an unacceptable % of CPU while running under FF + flash when comparing with the IE + flash, Chrome + flash.
Al, the issues with Firefox and Flash.  What version of Flash Player is that with?  I would really like to encourage you to try Flash Player 10.1 from http://labs.adobe.com
WIN 10,1,53,64
I can reproduce this on a single core machine only with some content and on Firefox as well as Chrome.  IE works well.  The content in for say http://trittonusa.com/support/ take about 30% CPU on my 3ghz single core Windows XP machine. 

Note this is not a problem at all with dual core from what I see in my tests.
<Note this is not a problem at all with dual core from what I see in my tests.

No kidding, as long as you throw enough horsepower at a problem you can hide *anything*.  

But that's not our goal here, our goal is to make things work on the lowest common denominator. Low powered systems, it should still work. 

It makes no sense making a web browser with a flash plugin that requires a 64 bit vista system with 12 cores and 128 GB ram.
I can understand your point.  Its not a matter of hiding anything.  This content mentioned runs fine (minimal CPU usage) if you take it out of the HTML container.  Sites that choose to use wmode=transparent will require more horsepower due to increased rendering requirements.

Try it and you will see 
http://trittonusa.com/support/ (HIGH CPU)
http://trittonusa.com/themes/triton/banner_flash%203.swf  (LOW CPU)
Charles, 
I am no flash developer, so I don't know how that is developed. But couldn't you set the maximum animation speed at a lower level if wmode=transparent is used, in the dev environment? So some developer with a 12 core computer that hides all his sloppy programming is made aware? 

I have actually suggested (years ago) when developers did websites that took too long to download on dialup (we were *all* on dialup) that the management should give those developers a 33.6 modem and have that be their internet connection.  So they get the perspective.
I just looked at both pizza company test cases. 

Something has changed and the flash animations no longer consume the entire computer for as long as they are playing. It seems likely the developers of those sites fixed the problem finally. 

However, the other test case, http://trittonusa.com/support/ still uses up 57% of the CPU as long as the tab is in front.  If I click another tab to front (like this bugzilla tab) it stops.  

Admittedly the pizzahut.com and dominos.com sites have about 10 million times the traffic of the Trittonusa.com site, so it was much more necessary to fix those. 

This bug is not resolved, flash still is unthrottled in any way and web developers can still undermine the system by sloppy code.  

I still think the Firefox and Adobe developers should work on a mechanism to prevent this CPU usage and to prevent it's duration.  There used to be a setting that worked on animated GIFs that let them only loop one time.  Why doesn't flash have something like that?
Hi Steve. Thanks for confirming what you are seeing. As we most development environments we cannot prevent poor coding outside of proper education for the masses.  Even though, we have been working hard to better our performance and be even smarter about resource usage in Flash Player 10.1.   It sounds like you might already been seeing these improvements.


Site uses animated flash, flash animations consume 50-99% of CPU cycles.
