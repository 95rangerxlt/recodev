Hey Ehsan,

I haven't verified this bug, but assuming it's reproducible, do you have any idea whether this is RES's bad, or ours?
It is almost certainly a problem that RES needs to fix. Perhaps https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Updating_addons_broken_by_private_browsing_changes or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Supporting_per-window_private_browsing will be helpful.
Jorge, can you please contact the author of this add-on?  Thanks!
I've filed an issue with RES's issue tracker:

Adding known RES developers.
This issue appears to have been fixed on trunk:

https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/335

Not sure when they're rolling out a new release, but I don't think there's much else we can do here.

I've never dealt with an add-on bug on BMO before...do we mark this RESOLVED FIX now?
hi there - main dev of RES (and guy who fixed the bug) here...

I am hoping to roll out a release in the next few days, just wrapping up a few things.

How quickly it'll get through AMO's process is out of my hands, of course.
Cool. So, if nobody complains, I guess I'll mark this one RESOLVED FIXED then.
