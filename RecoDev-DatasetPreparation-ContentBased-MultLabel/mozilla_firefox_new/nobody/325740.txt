Select a favorite in IE - opened in firefox
Type a URL in the address bar i n IE - opened in firefox
Hit the "go" button to the right of the addres bar in IE - opened in firefox

I love firefox, but there are some in my house (wife) who sometimes prefer IE.  (I have tried to get her to switch)

This is not pleasing for her.

Weird. Do you use fast user switching in WinXP? Are you still logged in under your account when your wife tries to use MSIE under her account?
We only use the account that I set up ages ago, so no user switching.

Very strange indeed.  I am going to try to get WINXP to go back to having IE be the default browser and reinsall 1.5.0.1 and see if it clears this up... probably some crazy foo in the registry.
I found what happened.  Related to trying to run IE7 in standalone mode.  It farked up IE6.
