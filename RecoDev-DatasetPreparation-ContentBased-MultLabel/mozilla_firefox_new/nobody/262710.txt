When sending a link from Firefox to a mail client, if the title tag is not
specified at all (not an empty title), the subject field is set to "null" when
the subject field just shouldn't be sent at all or set to ""

reporter (Aaron), can you still reproduce this with a recent build?
The original "Send Link" (bug 173954) had this issue, and the issue was still there after bug 214893, but one of the patches for bug 281988 fixed this (attachment 184113). Note that http://www.indicators.ak.org/indicators/indicatorpgs/ChildCareQualOutcms98.htm is not a good testcase, since it contains an empty <title> element. You need to test with a page that contains no title element.


Send link on pages without title results in null for title
