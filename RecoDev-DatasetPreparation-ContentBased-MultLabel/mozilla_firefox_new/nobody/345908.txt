In bug 345530 we tracked down one of the leaks to the search engine update system landing. See bug 345530 comment 0 for leak numbers.

I heard Gavin and Joey say something about timers in the update system... maybe those are related.

What about pulling the timeout registration outside of the object implementing the callback?  I'm just guessing here, but that seems to be the most reasonable way we could leak here.

Joey, could you make a patch that does what you mentioned in comment 2? I'd be willing to test it and report back as to whether it fixes the leaks or not.

Adam, this is the patch that I was describing.

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to fix the leaks. 

FWIW, earlier today (before I commented here) I commented out the entire engineUpdateService var and the everything that referenced it; e.g. SearchService._init() and this fixed the leaks.
I suspect that the patch in bug 349379 will fix this.
Fixed by bug 349379.
