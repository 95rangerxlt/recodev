confirming!

This is extremely irritating on common OS like Win XP where we still have the traditional title bar, as the title bar title is always wrong except for the one tab where it happens to be right.

What's the right component for this?
This was fixed by Bug 575870
Minimizing and restoring window updates the title and also when menu bar is displayed the title properly updates but when firefox button is displayed then the title freezes and only updates when minimizing and restoring window.
I don't know how firefox is making the new changes.
