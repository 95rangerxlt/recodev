Steps to reproduce:

1. Open App Manager
2. Launch simulator
3. Update an app
4. Debug the app, go to Style editor
5. Change a thing or two
6. Back to the list of apps, click 'update' to redeploy the app
7. Click "Debug", go to style editor
8. The modified styles are still there - the current redeployed styles are not

There's no way to make it "sync" or refresh to pick the actual styles, or at least no way that I know of, other than closing the simulator and starting anew.

Actually this happens with the debugger tab too. I changed code in the app, redeployed with "update" and although the new code is being executed (praise the mighty console.log), I still see the old code in the debugger.
My guess is that the App Manager doesn't properly evict its cached target after updating the app. Alternatively it could be that the server doesn't send "newScript" events in the debugger case, but that's rather unlikely as this is a heavily tested case in desktop Firefox.
Also, the debugger part seems to be bug 893696.
Jan, can you take a look at this?  At least for the Style Editor case, it seems like we should be able to know when the app has been reloaded, as we are able to do with regular web content in desktop Firefox.
It looks like the "tabNavigated" event is not triggered in the simulators, preventing the toolbox to invalidate its cached target. Tentatively blocking on bug #977043 which seems to fix it, but pending verification. However, I can't easily verify on a device because of bug #982710, so I'll try to fix that one first.
Actually doesn't depend on bug #977043. It reproduces in 1.2 and 1.3 simulators, but not on a device with nightly build, so the problem might already be fixed in master and require a backport.

The problem seems to be that "tabNavigated" events are not fired in the simulators. To see it happen on nightly / not happen in the simulator, open a browser toolbox and break on http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/framework/target.js#366, the debugger will break only when things work properly and the Style Editor will be updated afterwards.

I can't work on this on my machine because of bug #982710 that is hard to understand and seems to only reproduce on my machine.
Is this sill happening?
Unfortunately, this still happens in WebIDE. The new steps to reproduce are:

1. Open WebIDE
2. Select a simulator runtime
3. Select an app
4. Hit the Play button
5. Debug the app, go to Style editor
6. Change a thing or two (e.g. "background-color: red")
7. Hit the Play button again to redeploy the app
8. The simulator shows the app with original styles, but the Style editor still has your changes.
Only StyleEditor with 1.2 and 1.3?
Indeed, it now reproduces only in simulator 1.3, but doesn't in 1.4, 2.0 or 2.1.

Didn't try in 1.2 but I guess your assumption is correct.
Let's consider this fixed then.


Style Editor and Debugger don't "refresh" after updating the app in the device/simulator
