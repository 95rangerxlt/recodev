On any page I go to, tested on multiple machines, if the page takes more than 8-10 seconds to load all the images it simply stops the loading process.  The throbber continues, FasterFox if installed continues to count, however images are left either broken or with a place holder "trying" to load.  Right clicking on any image and choosing "view image" then hitting back will load more images but again if that takes more than 8-10 seconds it will "forget" again.  Many pages take 2-4 tries.  Note: I suspected our wireless broadband connection might be confusing it however I have tested in IE and Opera as well they have no issues with this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site (ie: worldofwarcraft.com)
2. Wait 8-10 seconds for images to load.
3. Observe images that do not load.

Actual Results:  
Some images displayed, others were left with placeholder/broken and throbber continued on.

Expected Results:  
All images display regardless of how long it takes to download them, throbber stops onload.

Done with clean install of latest FF build, using a local router & WAP behind a moterola wireless canopy system for broadband internet access.

FasterFox or another extension you have installed may be causing it. Please see the MozillaZine forums for help in tracking down the issue.
Whoops, forgot to paste the link: http://forums.mozillazine.org/
As stated, tested with a CLEAN build on multiple machines (new directory, no extentions, no prefs/user files).
Works in 3.5+
