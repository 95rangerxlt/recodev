Both selectNode and selectPlaceURI in tree.xml call this._getRootNode(), which doesn't exist.
Maybe it should be using this.getResultNode() instead?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
/* in places.xul */
var tree = document.getElementById("placeContent");
var node = tree.getResultView().nodeForTreeIndex(0);
tree.selectNode(node);
//or
tree.selectPlaceURI(node.uri);
Actual Results:  
TypeError on line 205: this._getRootNode is not a function

Expected Results:  
The node would be selected.

i have done a search in all places files and i cannot find any call to _getRootNode, so marking invalid, has probably been fixed sometime ago.
Only if you think of the day before yesterday as "sometime ago."

Fixed by the patch in bug 405774
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
