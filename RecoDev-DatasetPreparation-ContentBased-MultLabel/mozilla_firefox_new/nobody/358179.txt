It seems the new firefox 2.0 displays high CPU utilization even when not really viewing any pages. I saw others report this while viewing pages, but in my case there are NO pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox 
2.No need to go to any page, I use a blank homepage
3.

Actual Results:  
Extremely high CPU utilization

Expected Results:  
0% utilization. As it is, I don't want to use firefox any longer.

Your issue is likely due to an extension or rogue plugin. Please see the MozillaZine forums (http://forums.mozillazine.org) for assistance pinpointing the issue.
I totally uninstalled firefox, removed the mozilla directory from c:\program files and anything in the documents and settings. Still the same. I also checked the plugins that cause issues and I never had any of them.
I fixed it. It wasn't plugins, but rather bufferzone. I uninstalled it but it leaves a directory named virtual, once I removed it everything was OK.


I get high CPU utilization even when the firefox window is blank (70-95%)
