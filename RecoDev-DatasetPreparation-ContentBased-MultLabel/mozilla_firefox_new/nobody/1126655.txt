Just noticed this go by in my error console, after opening up devtools:
{
SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
   VariablesView.jsm:2058:41
}

That points to this line:
>    while (topView = parentView.ownerView) {
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/shared/widgets/VariablesView.jsm#2058

Looks like the assignment is intentional there. We just need to add an extra layers of parens around that while condition to silence this warning.

SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)? VariablesView.jsm:2058:41



Bug 1126655: Add extra layer of parens in while loop in devtools VariablesView.jsm, to suppress "equality mistyped as assignment" error console warning. r=vporof
