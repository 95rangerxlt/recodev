The new versions of the small back/forward nav icons have three problems.

(1) The tips of the arrows are drawn at an angle that's JUST different than 45 degrees.  This causes some odd antialiasing: at normal size, the arrow tips appear to change angle halfway through, and the points are a bit thick.  Because there's so little room to define these shapes, I'd suggest making the small icons use 45 degree angles for the tips, and leave the large icons as-is.
(2) The backs of the arrow stems look "chopped off" at normal size.  On the large icons, these backs have a light column of pixels inside a dark edge that's just a bit lighter than the top/bottom edges.  On the small icons, the effect is subtle; the light column (especially on the current right arrow) is almost impossible to see as different, and the "dark" column appears noticeably lighter than the top/bottom edges.  Because of this, the arrows don't look "closed".  I suggest changing the small icons to make the back column of pixels be as dark as the top/bottom rows, to make the edge more defined.  Perhaps the "light column" inside the dark edge could be lightened as well, but I'm not as sure on that one.
(3) The small icons appear to be reversed.  Note the position of the spherical "reflections" inside compared with the large icons.

I note that the arrows used for the Find Bar next/previous match buttons don't seem to suffer from any of these issues.
Note, if we get desparate for time, then we should at least try and fix comment 0 item (3) even if we don't fix the other two, because it seems like a clear, fixable goof.
More icon updates appear to have fixed this bug entirely.  Marking as such.
