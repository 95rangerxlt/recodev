I think we should just change -fr only at this time; we can get the other changes when we do the rest of the locales.

revied change to affect fr code in en-US only

concur. en-US only makes use of the yahoo-fr param/pref in the plugin, so your rationale makes sense.

I misunderstood, and managed to confuse Kev. This is the right patch. All the parameters for Firefox 3.5 should be "moz35". Locales might need to change their searchplugins to be locale-specific, but that's something we can do after.

Apologies for churn.

change fr code in Yahoo! search plugin (updated)

removing "browser.search.param.yahoo-f-CN", as it is no longer used in the product.
Does this need to land on m-c too, or just 1.9.1 branch?
It should land on m-c as well, unless the value should be different for post-3.5 versions... :)
