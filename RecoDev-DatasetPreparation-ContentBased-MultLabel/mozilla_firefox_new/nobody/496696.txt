We are updating all of the files in /branding/firefox/ which includes these three bmp files:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/other-licenses/branding/firefox/wizHeader.bmp

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/other-licenses/branding/firefox/wizHeaderRTL.bmp

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/other-licenses/branding/firefox/wizWatermark.bmp

Since we are doing this refresh so close to the build of RC1, I'm concerned that I might accidentally encode the files wrong and mess up the release candidate (for instance, the current files have a somewhat random resolution of 300.125 pixels/inch, which I believe is meaningless metadata, but I'm not sure).  I'll attach the new files to this bug in case anyone wants to spin up a try server build and check to make sure everything is ok.

Patch

Patch with the images attached by Alex.  I have pushed a try server build, and I'll update the bug when the links to it become available.

I'm not seeing the new images when I run the try server build
also tried vista, same thing

> I'm not seeing the new images when I run the try server build

My mistake, I forgot to change the branding directory before pushing the patch :(

I just pushed another copy to the try server.
no worries, I've got plenty of other stuff to check in the meantime
OK, I'm not sure how to produce a usable build with the try server.

The web interface which allows uploading a mozconfig file doesn't understand git style patches which are necessary for including binary stuff.  And with the hg interface we can't specify a mozconfig file as well...  I tried manipulating MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY directly in configure.in but it didn't work as well.

Not sure how to proceed here.
You might try changing MOZ_ARG_ENABLE_BOOL to MOZ_ARG_DISABLE_BOOL for official-branding in configure.in

Thanks for the suggestion, I pushed a new try server build...
mconnor mentioned that jmathies might know how to get this to work.

Apparently this doesn't work

Yes, it doesn't.
How about getting someone to build this locally instead of mucking about with tryserver?

I've spun a build with --enable-official-branding and will upload the installer somewhere once it's finished.

I usually use the web interface for custom mozconfigs. I'd ask in #build about custom mozconfig's w/hg push to try.
I'm getting a weird error about nssutil3.pdb not being present on official branding builds, and I have no idea how to solve it.  Maybe someone else can step up?
Hmm, is there some trick to applying this I'm unaware of? I can try and build this up if I can get it applied.

I've seen hg 1.0.x with this problem.  One way to circumvent it would be:

hg qimport ../bug496696.patch
hg qpush

For me, upgrading to the latest hg solved this problem.
OK, I finally managed to get a working official branding build.  The images look fine to me, but I've uploaded the installer for others to try as well:

<http://ehsanakhgari.org/sites/default/files/file/mozilla/bug/496696/firefox-3.5pre.en-US.win32.installer.exe>
Also, http://people.mozilla.org/~nthomas/misc/installer-test.exe
Given bug 492431, can this be closed now?
Yep, thanks everyone
