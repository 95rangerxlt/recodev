We have an editorial system based on FatWire. They use Frames and in one 
of the Frames they have an Java Applet 

When i log into it with ff36b3 i get this error message in Firebug: 

invalid 'in' operand plugin 
../components/nsBlocklistService.js 
Line 787 

At Login time the Session Variables in FatWire seems to be unreachable from within the Applet and the application is hence returning a timeout and logs the user out again. 


Everything work fine in ff3.5 with the same Java 1.6.10_b1 version. 


Thanks. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.User Logs in to FatWire CMS
2.The User is logged out again


Actual Results:  
The User is logged out

Expected Results:  
The Applet should start, and the user should stay logged in.

another user is having the same problem with Applets. (Im not sure if it is in combination with FatWire)

Some users is also complaining that it doesn't work on Windows 7 with FF 3.5.5, this might be a config Problem with Java.

FF36B5 solved this Problem


At Login time ,Java Applet in FatWire CMS system does not load correctly, FatWire assumes Session lost and logs user out.
