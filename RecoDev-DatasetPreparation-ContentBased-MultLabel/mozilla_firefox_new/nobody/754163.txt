What happens when you inspect a deeply nested element on the page.

Currently, if you right-click an element on the page and choose "Inspect Element", the Inspector UI pops up and the selected element is scrolled into view vertically. That's fine and should continue to happen, but it would also be nice if it could be scrolled horizontally so you can actually see the element's HTML if it's nested deeply in the page.

As it stands, the user has to scroll to the right to be able to see what was selected.

When I look at that screenshot, it looks like the inspector DOES scroll a bit horizontally. If I scroll AT ALL to the right from where it starts, I see the selected element.

So this bug would be to make the Inspector UI scroll the element fully (or as fully as can fit on screen) into view, not just up to the beginning of the element.
Is this still true?
It looks like in a recent (Elm) Nightly, it scrolls the beginning of the inspected tab to the center of the inspector UI.

Which is much better than it was before.
Please close this bug if you think it's fixed. Otherwise, please provide details about how we can improve the current behavior.

Thank you!


When you inspect an element on the page via the context menu, the element should scroll into view horizontally in the HTML Inspector UI.
