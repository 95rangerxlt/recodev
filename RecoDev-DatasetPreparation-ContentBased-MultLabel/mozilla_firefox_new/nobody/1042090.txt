We had reports from the wild (via Facebook a11y contact) that Firefox 'no longer works' with Windows HCM. I've tested it on Windows 7 a bunch, (turning HCM on and off, restarting, etc) and had various outcomes:
FF seemed to hang.
FF seemed to work properly.
FF seemed to mangle the tab names, and the window: shrink, restore, and close buttons disappeared (?).

Gijs have you had any similar reports?
Blair I noticed you filed a bunch of specific HCM bugs recently, did you also hear about any intermittend HCM breakage?

OK thanks George, so is the main concern here that content is not updating/reacting to Windows HCM?

Regarding #1 subview theme problem, I will file a separate bug.

It seems like various unrelated issues were mixed up in this bug. They should be filed and treated as individual bugs instead.

I already filed a separate Bug 1042263 about #1 regression.

This bug is for #2 problem (#2: Contents area regressed by Bug 946595).

No, but those bugs were largely from my own observations of where we're lacking in HCM - and I hadn't experienced any intermittent hanging/mangling while exploring HCM.
(In reply to Alice0775 White from comment #8)
> This bug is for #2 problem (#2: Contents area regressed by Bug 946595).

Hm, that fits with comment 1. But comment 0 describes hanging/mangling. So I think comment 1 should be split out to a separate bug.
Okay
I filed a saparete bug for #2 problem (#2: Contents area regressed by Bug 946595).
I filed a saparete Bug 1042625 for #2 problem.
I think there are no remaining issues here.


Windows HCM (High contrast mode) regression.
