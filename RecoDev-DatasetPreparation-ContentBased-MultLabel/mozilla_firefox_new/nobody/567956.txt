Sometimes, the highlighter-pane and inspector-panel panels will take up space in the browser window. Their contents are not visible, but the panels take up space as though they're normal XUL boxes (rather than panels/popups). The mainPopupSet expands to make room for them, creating a large empty space above the Menu Bar (see attached screenshot). Adding a hidden="true" attribute to these panels will fix the described symptoms.

I haven't found a way to reliably reproduce this. It's happened a couple of times when I've switched back to a Firefox window or after I've been logged in via RDP, but that may be a coincidence.

Known XUL bug. using hidden="true" is the current workaround used in other similar problems. But I thought Enn fixed this on trunk.
yeah, that's an odd one. I've seen something similar when hitting the "capsule" button in an OS X titlebar. I'll try the mentioned workaround.

Interestingly, doing this should also improve startup time, since the XBL bindings won't get attached until the popup is shown (we discovered this with Ubiquity - it also fixed a bunch of other weirdness). So it may be a good thing to do even if the underlying popup problem is fixed.
I thought I was doing this and forgot that the style and dom panels haven't landed yet.

I'm already setting that attribute on both panels and setting the attribute to false on initialization:

Any ideas?
Nope, sorry. That's the way the other panels in browser.xul do it.

I think this bug is no longer relevant. Can we close it?
We believe this is fixed. Reopen if necessary.
