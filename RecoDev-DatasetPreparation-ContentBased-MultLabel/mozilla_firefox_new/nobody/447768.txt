Scrolling down various pages (e.g. http://weblog.infoworld.com/yager/archives/2008/07/apples_iphone_c.html) causes the text to only be partially drawn correctly, with large blocks of white/black areas drawn instead, sometimes with a block of corrupted pixels between the good text and the blank bits. Scrolling back up causes some extra redrawing, but still partial text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://weblog.infoworld.com/yager/archives/2008/07/apples_iphone_c.html
2. Scroll down page (mouse drag on scrollbar works best), noting main text becoming blank a little after "From Section 3, Confidentiality:"
3. Scroll back up, seeing partial redraw of previously blank sections.
Actual Results:  
Partially blank text.

Expected Results:  
The full text being properly drawn!

Appears to now be fixed with build id 20090319030732. Site still feels slow, but no permanent visual corruption.


Partially drawn text on pages, with varying redraw on scroll up
