Testcase HTML

To use this, you have to whitelist the domain you're using and set browser.uitour.requireSecure;false

Whitelisting snippet:
Services.perms.add(Services.io.newURI("http://localhost:8000", null, null), "uitour", 1);
"End" of the search box? Why not the beginning? If the search bar is wide, it would seem odd to have it anchored way out in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, I was attaching it mentally to the magnifying glass which is currently on the right but will be on the left. Philipp, what do we want?

Should be left, where the magnifying glass will be when Flare lands.
Should be aligned like this: http://cl.ly/image/071G0d473l0L

Nitpick: I assume that's the case for LTR languages (like en-US, where the Yahoo change is happening), but for RTL the order is different.

So sounds like it should anchor to the "start" -- left in LTR, right in RTL.

Patch v.WTF

In theory this should be a fairly trivial patch, to just change the arrow panel's alignment from bottomcenter to bottomleft (ignoring RTL, and only doing this when target == search).

But of course that's too simple, because our arrow panel code seems to go braindead. The panel body is in the right place, but the arrow itself has now decided to place itself on the wrong side. O_o

I'll debug the panel code, but we probably will want a 34.x workaround that avoids touching that... Maybe special-case the searchbox anchor to be the engine icon/magnifying glass icon -- it'll be in the right place, and the panel alignment can stay as bottomcenter.

So...

adjustArrowPosition() in popup.xml isn't doing anything, because |this.alignmentPosition| is empty. And that appears to happen because GetAlignmentPosition() in nsMenuPopupFrame.cpp doesn't seem to know how to handle "bottomleft". The value of |position| at the top and bottom is -1 (UNKNOWN). If I switch the openPopup() call from "bottomleft topright" to just "after_start", the panel's arrow is at the right spot.

I'll file a followup on that. I think we can work around this well enough for now.

Patch v.1

This seems to work. I also tested with the ForceRTL addon, the panel and offset seem to be automatically adjusted to the expected position as in LTR.

Probably would be good to check the magic 18 pixel offset on Windows, and with whatever comment 3/4 are talking about.
Is there a bug # for "Flare"?

Bug 1088660 is Flare (new search UI).

I wonder if it wouldn't make more sense to override the anchor to be one of the anon kids of the search box (specifically, the search engine icon). The hardcoded 18px offset makes me nervous about styles and things like the devedition theme.

Patch (applies to Beta)

Patch v.1 doesn't seem to apply cleanly to beta for some reason, so here's the trivial fixup.
