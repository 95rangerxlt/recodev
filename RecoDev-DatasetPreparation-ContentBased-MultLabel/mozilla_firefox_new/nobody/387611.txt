On a stock installation of Slackware (any version), Firefox doesn't render fonts like other GTK apps do.  It honors the .gtkrc-2.0 file's "gtk-font-name" line.  It honors changes to fonts.conf (and symlinks in fonts/conf.d).  But none of the menus look like any other menu from any other GTK application.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Slackware.
2. Run firefox.
3. Run any other GTK application.

Actual Results:  
Firefox's fonts are "fuzzier" with or without a bytecode interpreter enabled.  

Expected Results:  
Firefox's UI fonts should look like other GTK apps.

On this system, the bytecode interpreter has been enabled.
This bug has been around as long as I've used Firefox on linux.

Is it better on trunk?  Font selection and rendering have been pretty much rewritten since Firefox 2.0.0.x.
It is fixed in trunk.  Sorry.


Mozilla Firefox renders fonts completely unlike any other GTK application
