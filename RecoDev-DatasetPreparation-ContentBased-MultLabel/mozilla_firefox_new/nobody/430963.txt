Ff3beta5 felt generally slower and more laggy than firefox 2, so I found a test case which clearly demonstrates this. On youtube, moving the mouse quickly onto and off a page element that changes (i.e. rating box) will cause playing flash video to begin dropping frames badly. This behaviour does not happen in firefox 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a youtube video (such as the one in the url) and start playback
2. move the mouse quickly and repeatedly onto and off the "Rate:" stars below the video, causing the field to toggle between "98,322 ratings" and "Login to rate"
Actual Results:  
The video will begin dropping frames very badly.

Expected Results:  
Smooth playback should continue (like on ff2)

- I have a pretty good machine, dualcore athlon 4800+ 2.4ghz 1GB ram.
- I moved .mozilla and started with a fresh one with only flash on it, so this problem cannot be related to addons.
- Iceweasel 2.0.0.12 from the Debian repos and Firefox 2.0.0.14 from getfirefox.com both work perfectly and do not show this problem, even if I enable all my extensions (adblock plus and ~ 15 others)
- firefox 3 beta 5 performed much worse than the nightly for which this bug is filed: on the beta, even moving your mouse onto and off the share\favourite\playlists\flag links at the bottom would cause the video to drop frames like crazy. On the nightly it seems to be restricted to the Rate: box.

I just made the test and I confirm that the problem is true (Firefox 3 beta 5 in Linux Ubuntu 8.04 with flash plugin non free).
I (the original reporter) don't see this issue anymore in RC1. :) I guess it was accidentally fixed. Awesome!
