patch v1

browser_586068-cascaded_restore.js is quite a big file consisting of multiple tests. We have a couple of intermittent failures with this and it would certainly help to split this into multiple test files to ease debugging a little.

This should also reduce the possibility of cascading failures because at the moment it doesn't seem like the test state is cleanly restored before moving on to the next sub-test.

There are some strange style editor crashes on try. Not sure why they should be related...

Style editor crashes are fixed. Need to figure out some intermittent timeout in the new tests:

Ok, my patch wasn't the culprit. Will be fixed by bug 794436.
