When you open the bookmarks organizer and try to export in a file with unicode characters, Firefox generates two files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open your bookmarks organizer.
2. Go to File -> Export...
3. Change the name "bookmarks.html" to "букマークス.html"
Actual Results:  
Firefox saves two files: one that actually contains all the data (_______.html) and other which is zero sized (букマークス.html).

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have saved one file with the name "букマークス.html" and correct data.

It's unlikely that this is going to be fixed in the old bookmarks code on the branch. Does this problem occur on the trunk, with the new Places code?
Well, it seems to be fixed in Minefield v3.0a8pre, but not in Firefox v2.0.0.7
