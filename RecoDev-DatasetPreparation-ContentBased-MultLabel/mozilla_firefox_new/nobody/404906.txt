Have a look at the following two screenshots:

http://webgenius.co.nz/2.0.0.9.jpg

http://webgenius.co.nz/3beta1.jpg

They both show a history auto-complete for the string "mer".  The first one, which is Firefox 2.0.0.9 (ignore my user-agent string), displays what I would expect.  The second, which is Firefox 3 beta 1, displays it out of order.

The whole title tag for the atlasproaudio.com site is (excuse the spam):

Atlas Pro Audio - 
Rupert Neve Designs, The Revolver, Studio Electronics C2S, Great River MP-500NV, Wunder CM7, Tube Tech, Buzz Audio Essence, Buzz Audio Potion FET, Bock Audio, McDSP, Vintech Audio, Purple Audio, Mojave Audio, Telefunken USA, Peluso Mics, Chameleon Labs, Weiss Digital, Crowley & Tripp, Apogee, Elixir, LAVRY, GREAT RIVER, CHARTER OAK, MERCURY, MARTECH, TOFT AUDIO DESIGNS, OLD SCHOOL AUDIO, OSA, Lynx Aurora, GREAT RIVER, AEA R84, Telefunken, Benchmark DAC-1, Millennia Media, DISTRESSOR, Royer R-121, Crane Song, Pendulum, Chandler, Pro Audio Gear for Central Florida, Orlando, Miami, Tampa, Nashville, Atlanta, NYC, LA, Chicago, Toll Free @ 866.235.0953

As you can see, the string "mer" is in there once, it also appears once or twice in other meta tags.  Still, I would expect mercenary.com (whose title begins with the word "Mercenary") to be listed above atlasproaudio.com

The Firefox 3 beta 1 install was directly over the top of the 2.0.0.9 install, and neither of the sites in question were visited between the two screenshots being taken.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a copy of Firefox 2.0.0.9 installed.

2. Make sure that both atlasproaudio.com and mercenary.com have been visited and are in the history file.

3. Install a copy of Firefox 3 beta 1.

4. Open a new tab, and type "mer" (without quotes) into the address bar.
Actual Results:  
atlasproaudio.com is listed ahead of mercenary.com.

Expected Results:  
mercenary.com should be listed ahead of atlasproaudio.com.  atlasproaudio.com should be in the results I guess, but not near the top.

Actually don't worry about this - I think it's just a case of not giving the address bar enough time to get acquainted with browsing patterns.

Either way, the two images I gave as reference aren't there any more.


Strange ordering of history entries
