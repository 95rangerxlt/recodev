Not a high priority, but a nagging thing.  Here is a link to try with latest bits:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=672324392d7c

clicking on one of the orange 's' jobs, you see a lot of these in the preview pane:
JavaScript warning: chrome://browser/content/pocket/main.js, line 417: SyntaxError: unreachable code after return statement


I am open to adding any preferences, etc. to talos to help remove this.

Relevant code from comment 0:

main.js
   ...
   410     function resizePanel(options) {
   411         var iframe = getPanelFrame();
   412         iframe.width = options.width;
   413         iframe.height = options.height;
   414         return;
   415 
   416     	// TODO : Animate the change if given options.animate = true
   417     	getPanel().sizeTo(options.width, options.height);

This got fixed by the changes in bug 1161793.

Dunno if there are any plans to eventually make these fatal in chrome (or at least test environments); I've seen similar in other places and agree it's annoying to have it clutter up logs.


javascript warnings in talos about unreachable code - dozens per run clutters the logs
