i have my bookmark toolbar items located in my menubar, just to the right of the help menu.  i also have the toolbar itself flagged as not visible.

since bug 404109 landed, when i open a new window, the bookmark toolbar items are not visible in the menu bar.

as soon as i open the customize toolbars window, the bookmark toolbar items appears; without me having to manually add it to the correct location.  this step needs to be repeated for every new window that i open.

Screenshot of error

a picture is worth a thousand words, or so i've been told.
looks like build 2008013104 has fixed the problem (probably by bug 414836).


"bookmark toolbar items" placement forgotten when next to menus
