The "Easy YouTube Video Downloader" addon stopped working after bug 845063 removed the dummy Private Browsing service. Is this a bug in the addon?

STR:
1. Install addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-video-downl-10137/
2. Load any YouTube video page
3. Look for a "Download" button.

RESULT:
As of Nightly 2013-02-27, the "Download" button is no longer displayed. I bisected mozilla-inbound changesets for that day and identified bug 845063 as the regression point.

btw, this bug does not depend on Private Browsing being enabled or disabled. The result is the same.
Jorge, can you please contact the author of this extension and let them know about this problem?
Copying Meredith from Alactro.
Easy Youtube Downloader seems to currently be using SDK version 1.12 - updating to SDK 1.13.2 will I suspect solve this issue. SDK 1.14 will be released next week and will also include initial support for per-window private browsing, as will the SDK apis included in Firefox 21.
Easy YouTube Video Downloader version 6.8 fixed this problem. :D

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-video-downl-10137/versions/?page=1#version-6.8
Note: going to the add-on's main page and clicking 'install' still gets me version 6.7, packed with SDK 1.12. Jorge: is 6.8 only preliminarily reviewed.

WFM, it seems to be approved.
With Easy YouTube Video Downloader 6.7 the issue is still reproducible with Firefox 22 beta 1. 

But with version 6.8 of the add-on, the "Download" button provided by it is showing as expected with Firefox 22 beta 1 (build ID: 20130514181517).

Considering this, I'm marking this issue verified.
Verified with Mac OSX 10.8.3 in 32bit mode.

Maybe you can find more useful information on http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/home or on IRC, on the #addons channel.
In addition, this bug is fixed so you're hitting another issue.

Bugzilla is not a forum. It's aimed to report issues with Firefox and eventually fix them in the future versions. If you want to get it works ASAP, you should use the support forum or report to the add-on developer.

Hi, Scoobidiver, thanks for your explaination, yes sorry, that's why i'm trying to find related issue before create a new topic. No i don't need to get it works ASAP. I already try to search on support forum. I hope the developer team for that addon can fix that issue ASAP, because many people complaining about that lately. 

Thank you...
Yofie, I suggest you try to get in touch with the author of the add-on.  They are probably the best person to help with this.
