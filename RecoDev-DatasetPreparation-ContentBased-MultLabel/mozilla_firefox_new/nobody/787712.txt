When we support asynchronous types, our tests will not be able to be synchronous.

When we support non-painful testing of the output of asynchronous commands, our tests will not be able to be synchronous.

We should remove the run() method.

Then move to a pattern where tests run asynchronously, and don't finish until all outstanding tests have completed, and individual tests can add to the list of outstanding things.
