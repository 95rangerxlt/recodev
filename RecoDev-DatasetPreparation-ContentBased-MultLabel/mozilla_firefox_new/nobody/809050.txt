Currently, in object popups of the WebConsole (thing that appear when you click on a logged object), only own properties can be seen.
It would be nice at least to provide a link to visualize the [[Prototype]] of the object.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 794823 ***
This may not be entirely a dupe. Bug 794823 was all about providing the extra functionality, but we now need to fix bug 808370 - Use the VariablesView in webconsole.

Mihai, what do you think?
Agreed with Victor. We need bug 808370 then we can re-evaluate this bug.

Thank you David for the bug report.
This bug should be fixed by bug 808370. We now show an object's own properties and the prototype chain can be inspected with the variables view.

Please reopen if you believe otherwise.


Better object introspection in object popup
