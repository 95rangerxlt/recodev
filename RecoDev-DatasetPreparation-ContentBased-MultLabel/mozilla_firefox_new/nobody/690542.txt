Current NightlyDebug.app.
Close all windows, then try to open Tools -> Web Developer -> Web Console:

JavaScript error: resource:///modules/HUDService.jsm, line 6028: window is null

at the shell. I guess nobody told it that Mac doesn't have to have open any windows at all. ;-)

What would be the proper behavior here?

a) do nothing (without errors!)
b) open the web console on an empty page
c) open the web console on the home page
d) open the web console on whatever comes up after session restore
e) ?

Everything besides (a) smells like trouble to me, since it will mess with the session restore mechanism.
Maybe the command shouldn't be active at all.
There's not much point in opening a new window just to use something that wants to do $stuff to your current window â€¦
Good idea, the Page Source menu item is similarly disabled.
Or, just wrap that call in a try/catch and reportError("Cannot open the Web console when no windows are present")

This is a very minor problem
likely no longer a problem (or the problem's moved).
