Steps to reproduce:

This is the second time this has happened, so I'm considering it a bug.

While having 12 windows open with multiple tabs each, and shortly after resuming from an unexpected termination (in this second case, a BSOD); a new termination in under 10 minutes (invoked by the user due to #764298) only a partial session is recovered. In both instances it was half, but it may vary depending on the amount of time between crashes. Since the complete data was saved on the HDD, this shouldn't happen; I'd suggest storing active session data in a different file until the full session has been written to disk, then renaming both and using the old file as scratch space to write out the active session on the next 'loop.' In the event of only partial data in the active file, what's left can be reconciled with the old data, and less data will be lost.
(I know you hate suggestions for how to write the code, and that's only a poorly fleshed out idea; but maybe it will lead somewhere that will prevent session data loss in small time scales)

This sounds a lot like bug 637020. I assume this issue will be fixed by it.
Marking as fixed by bug 637020.
