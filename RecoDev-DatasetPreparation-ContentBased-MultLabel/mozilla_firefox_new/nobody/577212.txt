The tasks "Enter private browsing" and "Quit private browsing" in the Windows 7 jumplist are sometimes incorrect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Start private browsing mode
3. Close Firefox
-> See results below

Additionally:
4. Click "Quit private browsing"
-> See results below
Actual Results:  
Task in jumplist says: "Quit private browsing"
Additionally:
When clicking it, Firefox will start in private browsing mode, restoring the tabs you had opened before switching to private browsing last time. Switching back to normal browsing then will open only an empty tab, so your original session gets lost!

Expected Results:  
Task in jumplist should say: "Enter private browsing"

Similar problem when Firefox is closed, clicking "Enter private browsing" in jumplist:
In this case, last session will also be restored within private browsing mode, switching back to normal mode will leave only an empty tab.
Did bug 568694 regress already or does it still depend on fixing the private browsing on startup?

That bug has been fixed, but I don't know what it has to do with this one.

I see Mike duped to the bug I was thinking of in the latter.  I guess I couldn't tell right away if this bug was related to the jumplist bug or related/depended on the dupe.
bug 568816 (re-)landed, but (part of) this bug is still not fixed:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Start private browsing mode
3. Close Firefox
4. see task in jumplist

Actual Results:  
Task in jumplist says: "Quit private browsing"

Expected Results:  
Task in jumplist should be reset, saying: "Enter private browsing"

(actually, the other part -clicking the task when firefox is closed- is not working for me anymore at all, bug 601391?)

that is going to be fixed by the patch in bug 598229.
I verified that this is now fixed by bug 598229.


If browser is closed while in private browsing mode, jumplist entry is not correctly updated
