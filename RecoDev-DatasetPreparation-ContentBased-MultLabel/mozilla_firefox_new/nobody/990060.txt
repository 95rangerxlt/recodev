I did a bisect just to be sure, and as you expected, the problem started appearing after:

I agree that fixing the addons as a follow-up to Masatoshi's patch is the correct solution.
Unless someone started working on that, I'll handle releasing adbhelper as I'm already used to that
and it shouldn't take me much time to upload new xpis.
Yay, thanks Alex!  I guess libadb.js may need the same treatment...  I'll file it separately just to be clear about it.

Looks good, just a few style nits to address.
Just released 0.2.2 version with this fix.
