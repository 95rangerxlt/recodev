use in dual screen mode than disconnect external monitor. open a new window and it is placed on the screen that no longer exists. This is very frustrating.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use external monitor
2.open firefox, move window to external screen
3.close firefox
4. disconnect monitor
5. open firefox

Actual Results:  
the newly opened browser window does not appear on the screen, it is still openoing in the old non-existent screen. 

Expected Results:  
detect if location exists before opening the window there, if it does not exist use a screen that does.

This is a usability and frustration issue!
