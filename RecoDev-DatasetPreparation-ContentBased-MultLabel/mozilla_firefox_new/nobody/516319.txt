While downloading a large file if you attempt to download another file, but leave the open file dialog box open you will notice the time estimated for the download to finish will jump up. Once you close the dialog box the time will go back to normal. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start downloading a large file, keep the download file dialog box open and notice the estimated time until the download is finished. 
2.Attempt to download another file, but leave the process as the open dialog box. 
 
Actual Results:  
The estimated time for the active download increase.

Expected Results:  
The estimated time for the download should only change once you actually start downloading the second file and not while you just have the dialog box open.
