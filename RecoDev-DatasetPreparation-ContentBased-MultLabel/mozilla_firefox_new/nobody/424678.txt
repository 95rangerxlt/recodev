When I try to shrink the font really small, it "bounces back" to a specific size (like 6pt or something).  I can't shrink indefinitely like I could in Firefox 2.  The minimum font size is set to None.

FYI, the behavior is different than when a minimum font size is specified.  When I specify a minimum font size it stops before going smaller.  But with this bug it's actually shrinking as far as I want, but half a second later pops back to some predefined minimum or something.

Tested in 3.0b5pre (minefield) and problem still remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set minimum font size to None.
2. Make sure "Zoom Text Only" is checked.
3. Use ctrl+minus or control mouse wheel to shrink text really small.
Actual Results:  
Text shrinks like I wants, and then automatically "pops back" to something like 6pt after half a second.

Expected Results:  
Text keeps shrinking indefinitely.

I almost wouldn't mind this bug so much if it just stopped at the 6pt instead of going smaller and then bouncing back.  I think it's the bouncing more than anything that's kind of annoying.  But it would also be nice if it let me shrink the text indefinitely like Firefox 2 would.  Otherwise, it feels like IE setting limits on what I can do.

BTW, I disabled all my extensions and had the same problem.

I totally forgot about this bug.  Wow, I can't believe it went unnoticed for 2.5 years.

But anyway, it seems to be working fine now in Firefox 3.6.7, so I'll close it.


Minimum font size None doesn't work.
