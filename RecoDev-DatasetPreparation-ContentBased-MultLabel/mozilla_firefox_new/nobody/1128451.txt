User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20150125221831

Steps to reproduce:

Enter a URL in the location bar, e.g.: sdfsdfgdsfg.co.za
While it is loading (a slow internet connection helps replicate this), quickly change this to something else, like google.com
After google.com has loaded, wait for about 2 minutes.


Actual results:

google.com loaded, but afterwards, the previously typed URL loaded, wiping out google.com. In the case of an invalid domain, the page shows the "problem loading page" page.


Expected results:

The previously typed URL request should be cancelled completely.

This seems to be fixed in Firefox 39.0


Firefox does not cancel request to previously-typed URL when corrections are made
