Patch to correctly set margins to center image within monitor

Spinoff from bug 585503:
Preview image in SetDesktopBackground is not centered when the image is larger than desktop size and position=center.

Note, this also applies to the FF2.0 branch.

See also bug 385844 where I'm using <canvas>. If drawImage() takes negative offsets, that could be used here as well.
Yes, that could be done. However for the 'center' scenario, we can just use a normal 'image' widget and just set negative margins on that, instead of creating a canvas object.
canvas is actually a bit easier, as you don't need _createImage().
Fixed by the patches from bug 385844 and bug 385503.
