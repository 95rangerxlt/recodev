Do you see some messages in the error console?
Ah yes. I see the following:

Timestamp: 7/16/12 9:25:56 AM
Error: An exception occurred.
Traceback (most recent call last):

I also see a bunch of these, though I'm not sure if it's related:

Adding Dave from 1Password.
Thanks for looping me in on this Jorge.

Does the Addon SDK support the nightlies? Line 298 of panel.js was last changed by Irakli Gozalishvili on 2011-11-10, so this failing code is not new.

My guess is this requires an updated Addon SDK so it would be great to loop someone in from that team. 

Cheers!

Irakli, comments?
Sorry I meant to add this but forgot: The version of 1Password Paul mentioned (3.9.5.b3) is using Addon SDK 1.8.  I'm sure Irakli will want to know that :)
This should be fixed in the SDK 1.9 betas due to this pull request landing: https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/pull/471
Yes, it will be fixed by bug 766917.
Unfortunately, for some unknown reason it wasn't pulled in yesterday's 1.9b2 version.

Dave, you would need to repack to 1.9 (when fix pulled) in order to make it work on Nightly again.
Actually I was wrong this fix was already part of 1.9b1.
So that you should be able to repack against yesterday's 1.9b2:

Thanks for your help everyone.

I upgraded to the SDK 1.9 beta in our latest beta and everything seems to be working fine. You can grab the beta for yourself here:

Thanks all! I apologize for neglecting to close this for so long. I've got some more problems w/ the addon in Aurora now, but I'll file a new bug for that.
