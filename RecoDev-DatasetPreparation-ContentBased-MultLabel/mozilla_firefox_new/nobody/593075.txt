inspector bug

Noticed this while testing bug 588657. STR:

1) navigate to about: blank 
2) highlight the page, so the little orange rect is on the top of content window
3) hit alt

The orange band leaves a clipped rect in chrome where it was originally positioned.

The Inspector will be shipping in the next release of Firefox (after Firefox 4), so this does not block the Firefox 4 release.
Fixed by bug 642471.


Inspector highlight overlay clips content when displaying the menu bar
