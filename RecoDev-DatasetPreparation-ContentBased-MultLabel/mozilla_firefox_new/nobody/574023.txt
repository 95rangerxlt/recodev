Here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/console/hudservice/HUDService.jsm#1982

btn.setAttribute("class", "toolbarbutton-text toolbarbutton-1 bookmark-item hud-filter-btn");

toolbarbutton-text and bookmark-item are definitely wrong. toolbarbutton-1 seems inappropriate as well, as I think it's intended for toolbarbuttons in the primary toolbars.
