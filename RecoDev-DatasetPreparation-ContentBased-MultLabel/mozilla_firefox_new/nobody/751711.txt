Patch v0.1

The first parameter is supposed to be an image url, which we don't need. The name parameter should almost never be used (as far as I can tell). And with Growl, only whitelisted alert names can be shown. Null names fallback to "General Notification" which is whitelisted by default. So if we actually pass the name we thought we were passing, then the notification won't show.
