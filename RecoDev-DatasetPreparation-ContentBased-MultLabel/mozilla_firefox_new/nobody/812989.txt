Through having forgot to do this on Thunderbird, I realised that these two variables in confvars.sh haven't been updated:

ACCEPTED_MAR_CHANNEL_IDS=firefox-mozilla-beta,firefox-mozilla-release
MAR_CHANNEL_ID=firefox-mozilla-beta

I'm not 100% sure on the effects, but I believe this means that Firefox ESR could mistakenly accept the wrong snippets and get updated to a mainstream based release. Hopefully Brian/Rob can advise here.

Review of attachment 683049:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If we will be doing upgrades between ESR_X to ESR_Y, then we should just call this firefox-mozilla-esr
If we will continue to do updates for ESR10 separate from ESR17 though, then what you have is correct.

ESR17 has had 0 releases done already right? Otherwise this would cause a problem if someone already had the old values.  ESR10 is upgrading to ESR17 right?

Correct, 0 releases and ESR10 will be upgrading to ESR17 once 17.0.2 is released.
Perfect, thanks.
