FF 1.5.0.3 (and minefield 13 may 06 build) on Fedora Core 4 doesn't handle flash streaming video well in Shockwave Flash 7.0 r63.

Any video from youtube.com or video.google.com does display initially, but pauses after 1 second.  I can drag the slider to a new position, which gives another 1 second of video, but then it pauses again.  There's no sound at all (other sound apps like xmms, mplayer work fine).

The worst bit is that when I try to leave the page, 99% of the time (everytime in recent memory) the browser hangs completely.  Finally killing the X window gives the "application is not responding" message.  gdb stack trace from the minefield version included below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF with Shockwave Flash 7.0 r63 plugin
2. Visit video.google.com or youtube.com
3. Go to any sample video.
Actual Results:  
4. Watch the video start without sound, then pause after 1 second.
5. Drag the slider to attempt to jump start it, watch it pause again after 1 second.[ff hangs even if you skip this step]
6. Use the back arrow to leave the page
7. Although the title bar changes correctly, the main window doesn't change at all.  Watch as ff hangs forever and must be killed externally.


Expected Results:  
4. Video should start and play to completion (or as much as has been downlinked)and should have audio.
5. Video/audio should continue from the new position.
6. Back arrow should successfully return to the previous page.
7. FF shouldn't hang forever.

  I'm using Shockwave Flash 7.0 r63 on a pentium 4 running a 2.6.11-1.1369_FC4smp Fedora Core 4 linux system.  Under FF 1.5.0.3 I'm using the delicious 1.0.2 extension, but the same problem occurs in minefield without that extension.
Also does the same thing on Windows XP. Test duplicated and works fine in IE and older Firefox. Hangs after 1 second and also no audio.
I uninstalled 1.5.0.5 and reinstalled it. This fixed the problem. Also, it seems to work fine with Flash 8, my issue was with Flash 9. The reinstall fixed my bug
Thanks for checking it out, but unfortunately even a fresh install doesn't fix it for me under Fedora Core 4 linux.
Found out that the problem was that the esd sound daemon wasn't running.  So FlashSleep was mistakenly hanging waiting for a reply from a nonexistant daemon.  Running "esd&" before starting firefox to start the background daemon fixes the problem, youtube and google videos work, and I'm able to exit pages successfully.

Would be nice if Flash didn't hang forever waiting for a service that doesn't exist.


flash streaming video has no sound, pauses after 1 second, hangs browser on page exit
