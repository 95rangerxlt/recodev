Please have a look at this Tom and feel free to send it over to someone else too if necessary.
See bug 1183235 for the ObservedDocShell implementation, and bug 1183231 for the observed docshells list.

I think someone else must review.

BTW it seems to me that TimelineConsumers adds new static initializers,
which I think is still not supposed to be done.  (And if that isn't the rule
any more, I'd like to know.)

I have no idea, I haven't been doing any C++ hacking in a very long time.

It is a bit messy that in some patches you explicitly pass reference to
mObserved, and here you use it explicitly.
I wonder if DocShell could have a method to return reference and use that everywhere.
So, please add such and use it here. And there was the other patch where
mObserved was passed as param, and IIRC also docshell. Perhaps only docshell could be passed.
If you think a new review is need for that patch, please ask
