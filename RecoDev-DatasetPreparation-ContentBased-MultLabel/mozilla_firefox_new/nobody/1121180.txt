On dark theme, there are 2 issues :
- The timestamp text is invisible (black text on dark background)
- The time "dividers" are too bright

Lowered opacity, increased saturation/brightness on blocks -- looks better.
Moved the timeline stroke ticks to render behind the flames (visible because blocks are more transparent, but do not get in the way of the text, which was really apparent in the dark theme)
Colors now appropriate for each theme
FlameGraph now a commonjs module
FlameGraph now has `force` option for `refresh`

This looks much better ! One thing though, can you reduce the opacity of the dividers a bit ? They are much brighter than the ones in the overview view.

Possibly rgba this, so the dividers aren't so gnarly. Using rgba(128,136,144,0.15) like the netmonitor could possibly work, or just (128 ..., 0.25).

Might want to change this in the other bug regarding text readability.

Bug 1144034 for flamechart readability is partially size, but the windows screenshots there I think is something else.

Updated timeline stroke color -- looks good!

Had to update tests due to size changes. Flame graph tests have always failed locally for me, so this'll be fun to test.

You should probably check out the changes to the tests, to make sure everything still makes sense, because of the text size change

Maybe take the opportunity to make all of these computations dynamic based on the const? Here and in all the other tests. Or file a followup.

Tests now use FLAME_GRAPH_BLOCK_HEIGHT constant
