We removed windows gu-IN from shipped-locales for RC1, we should add it back.

Likely, we can remove the platform list alltogether, as we did for pa-IN.

remove platform limits from gu-IN

MacOS is still bad so we should not take away linux; we should add back in win32.

The line should read:
  gu-IN win32 linux

Approved if this change is made
