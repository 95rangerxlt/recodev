A recent change broke ending a style edit via a click.

STR: 

1. Open http://mozilla.org
2. Use the Inspector to select the body element
3. Click on the value for "font-family"
4. Type "monospace"
5. Click outside the input field

ER:

It should persist the change (update the appearance of text on the page) and display the new value in the rule view.

AR:

The change is actually applied (you can see it on the page), but the rule view reverts to the previous value before editing.

There is no issue if you end your edit by pressing "Enter" instead of using the mouse.  It works as I would expect in Aurora.  I am suspecting this changed with bug 902966.

This might already be fixes in fx-team thanks to bug 913509.
Briand, can you confirm?
Sorry, just woke up, sleepy head.
I meant "this might already be *fixed*"
and "Brian" not "Briand"
This is fixed by Bug 913509 in fx-team.
