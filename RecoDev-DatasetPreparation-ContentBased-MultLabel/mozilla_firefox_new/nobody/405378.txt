All of a sudden, I can no longer insert addresses either into the "To", "CC", or "BCC" address lines when using "Compose" in Yahoo! Mail Classic--however, I have NO such problem when using Internet Explorer 7!  When I check on the "Insert addresses" link (or "To:", as they both do the same thing) when using Firefox 2.0.0.9, my Yahoo! Mail Address Book will open as it normally should--but when I check-off those persons' names whom I wish to send the Email either as a "To", "CC" or "BCC" (by  using the appropriate check boxes), and then click the "Insert Checked Contacts" radio button, the Yahoo! Mail screen now always goes BLANK--instead of going back to the "Compose" page as it should with the addresses having being inserted into the address bars of the message being composed!  This ONLY happens in Yahoo! Mail "Classic"--NOT in the "new" Yahoo! Mail (which I don't like because of having smaller fonts which are harder to read)--and does NOT occur in Internet Explorer 7! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Yahoo! Mail Classic and click "Compose" radio button.
2. When on the Compose page, click either the "Insert addresses" link or "To:" (to the left of the main address bar). 
3. Yahoo! Mail Classic Address Book opens.
4. Check either the "To", "CC", or "BCC" boxes for those people whom you wish to send the message to by any of these methods.
5. Click either the top or bottom "Insert Checked Contacts" radio button. 
Actual Results:  
Yahoo! Mail Classic screen goes BLANK.

Expected Results:  
I should have been sent back to the "Compose" page with the various address bars of the Email I'm composing now having been filled-in.

Problem was resolved by making a change to the Tab Mix Plus add-on.

When in Yahoo! Mail Classic COMPOSE, "Insert addresses" no longer works, but still DOES WORK in IE7!
