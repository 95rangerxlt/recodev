1. Right-side section's items are placed lower then items in left-side section.
2. Hover effect of right-side section's items shouldn't touch middle separator.
3. Move submenu arrow in Developer little to the left, so it can be alligned with others.
4. Remove duplicated items in split-menus:
   4.1. New tab -> New tab
   4.2.  Print... -> Print...
   4.3. Options... -> Options...
   4.4. Help -> Help

Your fourth item regarding "duplicates" is intentional. That is by design, and is done in exactly the same way in the right-click menus of Office 2007 and above.
Also, for your third item to be fixed, it will depend on bug 589146.

I'll ask again: What's the point of having duplicated items in Firefox Menu? We are trying to get rid all of duplications, yet we are want to keep them in menu? Am I missing something?

How so?
Shifting this into separate bugs:

>1. Right-side section's items are placed lower then items in left-side section.

Bug 610773 - In the Firefox menu items in the right and left panes need to be vertically aligned

>2. Hover effect of right-side section's items shouldn't touch middle separator.

Bug 610830 - Menu items in the Firefox menu should have 2 pixels of padding on each side

>3. Move submenu arrow in Developer little to the left, so it can be alligned
with others.

This seems to be fixed now, not sure with which bug

>4. Remove duplicated items in split-menus:

This is intended, so that users who expand the menu looking for a command (not realizing that the main commands are active) can continue to move forward instead of having to fall back to the main menu.  Also this lets us expose keyboard shortcuts for the main menu items.
A dupe then? Or meta?
whichever you prefer
Thanks! Can you set it as New, please?
