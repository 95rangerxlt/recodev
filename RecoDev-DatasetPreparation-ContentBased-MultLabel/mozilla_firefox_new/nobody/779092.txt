Steps to reproduce:

Note: Possibly connected to bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494351

Adding contenteditable="false" to a textarea incorrectly prevents the spellchecker from working (underlining in red) when spelling errors are typed.


Actual results:

Nothing - no mistakes are underlined.


Expected results:

Spell checker does not work when contenteditable attribute is set to false - this should work as normal (see Opera/Chrome/IE/Safari).

Just to further this, the "spellcheck" attribute has no effect within textarea when the "contenteditable" attribute is set to "false" - despite the text actually still being editable.

The required/desired behaviour is that the browser honours the "spellcheck" attribute.
We should re-test this after bug 674927 gets fixed.
I believe that this is fixed now.


Contenteditable Breaks Spellcheck Attribute
