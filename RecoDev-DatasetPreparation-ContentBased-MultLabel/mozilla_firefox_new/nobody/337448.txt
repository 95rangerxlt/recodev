when caret browsing is switched on and the caret is positioned in a div-container (or any other block-level element) which has the CSS-property "position: relative;" and the page is scrolled down with the vertical browser scrollbar (or the mouse wheel) the caret disappears. If you scroll slowly down, you can see the caret getting smaller (looks like it would dive in the bottom of the line it is positioned in).
Don't know, if this behaviour is as it should or as it is logical in relative positioned elements, but it is a very big problem, when you have editable content (e.g. using "Mozile") in divs that are formatted "position: relative".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to e.g. http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/support/
2. downsize your browser window (until text "Site contact" is out of focus, so the page is larger than the browser window and the vertical scrollbar is shown,
3. then scroll to the top of the page
4. make sure caret browsing is activated (hit F7)
5. click in one of the first lines of the right column (column "Support resources", first line of "The Official Mozilla Firefox FAQ")
6. scroll down slowly using the scroll bar and watch the caret -> it should disappear slowly.

Actual Results:  
caret disappeared

Expected Results:  
better: whished result would be: the caret behaves like it does in static or absolute positioned elements - it stays at its position even the page is scrolled.

I'm using the latest Firefox release with no special theme or configuration (except some plugins like "Webdeveloper").

As I said, this was fixed on trunk, that is in Gecko 1.9, which will be shipped with Firefox 3.0 (but not 2.0 or 1.5.0.x).
