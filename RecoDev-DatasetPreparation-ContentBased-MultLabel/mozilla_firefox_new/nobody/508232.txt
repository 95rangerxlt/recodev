In Firefox 3.5.2 and 3.0.13 with the Skype add-on v3.3.0.3789 installed, when you login to the online banking site at www.nwolb.com after the second step (entering Pin /Password) you are returned to the login step 1 page. Disabling or uninstalling Skype add-on resolves the issue.
Also, at he HSBC internet banking, http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/HSBCINTEGRATION/CAM10;jsessionid=0000XRcE9AltDFGVRIiI0Y0HLcw:12ntf1ldo?IDV_URL=hsbc.MyHSBC_pib
one can login successfully but clicking on any menu item results in the you being returned to the first login page. Again, disabling or uninstalling the Skype add-on resolves the issue.
Both of the above first occurred with the 3.5.1 and 3.0.12 releases of Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log in to www.nwolb.com
2.enter customer number (D.O.B. + 4 digits)
3.enter security details
4. enter any details as if they are incorrect (as they will be unless you have an account). The incorrect details should normally return an 'incorrect details' text however the bug creates the login loop
Actual Results:  
as above

Expected Results:  
1.after pin/password has been entered correctly you should get a 'welcome to Natwest Online Banking' page
2. If you enter incorrect details, you should get a page informing you accordingly

not security sensitive. this is a bug in skype's extension.

Peter, please let us know when this is fixed so we can close this out.
Reporter, what skype addon version do you have?
I believe this has been resolved in current Skype versions. Have tested v5.0.0.6778 with Firefox 3.6.12 and 4.0b7 and bug is no longer present. Can close off
OK, but which version had the problem, do you recall?  We need to blacklist it...
It's in the original bug filed above, Skype v3.3.0.3789
Ah, indeed.  Thanks!
And in fact, that version is already blacklisted.
