We have tests for form submission, so if it really was broken in general, we'd know as soon as the breaking change landed :)

libosxform_xpcom is the 1Password extension, so likely not a problem with Firefox code. Try updating it, or reporting this to the extension author? Finding a regression range to find the Firefox change that busted it could be useful too, but given 1password's history it's likely that they're just relying on something they shouldn't be relying on.
Thanks for the clarification Gavin - I pushed this back to the 1Password developers.
Adding the stack that comes up on Mac so this gets picked up in crash stats.
the combined set of stack signatures makes this the #1 crash on beta4 in early data gathering.
any, reponse back from  1Password developers.  can we get them cc'ed on this bug to track status of a fix?   lets leave this extension compat bug open until we know a fix is in place.
1password is not listed on AMO, so I don't have any information on the developers. This is the homepage for the application and add-on: http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password.
I downloaded the Mac package and found the add-on code. As it often happens with add-ons listed elsewhere, there's a lot wrong with it, like having a maxVersion of 4.*
Unfortunately, the current version of 1Password 3 is not compatible with Firefox 4 betas.

We had quite a bit of trouble getting it to compile with the new Gecko SDK and there are still a few unresolved issues that we are working on.

Roustem: If it is not compatible with FF 4 can you please change the maxVersion in the extension to match that fact? Many of our beta users are hitting this crash.
Marcia, this is a great idea! I am not sure what was I thinking before, that would save us all a lot of trouble (I guess FF4b1 was working fine and then we left the extension enabled for all v4 builds).

I updated the compatibility settings and hope to get the new version published soon.
Roustem: It would be great to get this published before we ship Beta 5. Can you please update this bug when you have pushed the new version?

BETA5 addresses the Firefox 4b4 crash and BETA6 addresses a FF4 nightly crash.

BETA5: http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password/versions/betas#v30731
BETA6: http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password/versions/betas#v30735

(I'm not the developer, just a user that received BETA5 which fixed the crash for me.)
*** Bug 594440 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
blocking final for crashes to disappear or blacklist entry.
The latest version of the 1Password add-on works fine in Firefox 4 (both with login forms and basic auth). The Add-on Manager lists it as version 3.5.4beta 3 (and I know an earlier release fixed the form submission problems...)
I don't know what the policy is about blocklisting and whether we're still seeing these crashes, but it seems like we may be able to close this given that 1password has fixed this with an update on their end. I'm hesitant to close this myself not knowing if there's some sort of blocklisting required still.

This is on the hardblocker list, though, so we should try to pick this off one way or another soon.
looks like  volume for all libosxform_xpcom.dylib crashes is about 0-4 per day and its been that way for the last several weeks..
I'll make the leap and say this is fixed then.
Yes, we fixed it a few weeks ago. Sorry for the trouble!
