There are no benchmarks that focus on the kinds of JS features that Shumway needs. We should create one.

It would be really nice if we could find a contributor to work on this.

True. It's hard though. Benchmarking is hard. What's a good test for this? Does it use AVM1 or AVM2? Does it consist of script-heavy SWFs, or light ones like most banners? What would we actually measure? Time it takes to execute a frame? Which frame? Some form of average of frame execution time? So many questions.
Michael, do we need any Shumway-specific benchmarks beyond the Shumway Octane benchmarks on AWFY now?

The current AWFY benchmarks are sufficient.
