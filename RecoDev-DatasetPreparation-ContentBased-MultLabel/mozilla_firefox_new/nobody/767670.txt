Similar to how the keyboard shortcut for the Inspector doesn't turn off the feature, pressing Ctrl+Shift+V (on Windows) should return focus to the Developer Toolbar.

We can use Escape to exit the Developer Toolbar (again similar to the Inspector). If the user has the Inspector and the Developer Toolbar open, then they will hit Escape twice to fully exit these developer tools. I think this is acceptable.

[Developer Toolbar] Ctrl+Shift+V should give focus to the Developer Toolbar, not toggle it
