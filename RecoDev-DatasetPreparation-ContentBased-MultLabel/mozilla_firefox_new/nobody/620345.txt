When having a form with a textarea in a window opened with window.showModalDialog(), the textarea doesn't allow keyboard input. Right-clicking to paste some text does work, though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create 2 HTML pages, one with 
<HTML><BODY>
<script>
function test() {
  var txt = window.showModalDialog("modal.html", "titi", "dialogHeight:300px; dialogLeft:200px;"); 
}
</script>
<span onDblClick='test();'>Double-click here</span>
</BODY></HTML>

the other, called Modal.html with
<HTML><BODY>
<FORM NAME="extra">
Give a comment to the task<BR/>
<TEXTAREA name="comment" rows="6" cols="40""></TEXTAREA>
<BR/></FORM>
</BODY></HTML>
2. Open the first page, double-click the text
3. try to input some text in the textarea zone
Actual Results:  
No text appears when typing on the keyboard

Expected Results:  
to be able to input some text with the keyboard

right-click and paste text works, and scripting to use that text will also work.

Regression : worked fine with Firefox 3.6 (=> Choosing Major as the severity because of that)
