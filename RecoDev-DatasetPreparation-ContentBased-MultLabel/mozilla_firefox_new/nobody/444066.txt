Hard to describe as a non English. Look at the screenshot. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add search bar in bookmark bar and fill bookmark bar with bookmarks.
2. Resize the whole Firefox window (from any side).
3. Maximize Firefox window
Actual Results:  
Search bar and bookmarks dose not resize back when maximize.

Think you know.

I have reported this problem before and I was Very surprised its not fixed in 3.0. This problem has been there since 1.0 or as long as I can remember.

I see you file this before as bug 408571, which was marked as a duplicate of bug 393735.
I guess this is basically the same as bug 427280, now.

I know, kinda messy this, considering that bug 393735 was marked worksforme :/
I can confirm that this bug still exists.

Here's what I have before I resize the Firefox window:

Here's what I have after I resize and then maximize again:

It's supremely annoying. To fix it I have to go to
View -> Toolbars -> Customize
and then just click "Done" and it goes back to this again:

I can also confirm this bug, I have the exact problem as shown in the pictures above. I have TinyMenu and Fission addons installed so I can have maximum viewing space for my 1024*600 netbook screen (Menu, Icons, Address bar and bookmarks all on one bar).

Under Ubuntu, I have Firefox start maximised, but EVERY time I start it up I have to right-click the bar > Customize > Done to be able to see all my bookmarks, rather than having them hidden under the >> dropdown menu.

The bug is also perfectly reproducible under Windows XP, but it doesn't happen on startup.

To avoid that, don't have Firefox maximized. "Unmaximize" the window and drag the window borders till you have cover the whole desktop.

I figured. Although, once I did that and remaximised the window, it stopped happening on startup - now its only when I resize the window.
I found that telling it to sort items by name, is a good workaround for this bug.

The bug is still in Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090327 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre

Why haven't  this bug not been taken care of yet? It is in my eyes a major bug. Even though you probably shouldn't put the search box in the bookmark bar, I guess that there a many ppl that do so to save space (I'm one of those). This bug has been there as long as I can remember, perhaps even since Firefox 1.0 (but I'm not sure), So isn't it time to fix this, or cant it be done?
Is that still a problem with Firefox 3.5.7 or 3.6RC2?
It's still in 3.5.7, but not in 3.6RC2 Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2pre) Gecko/20100119 Namoroka/3.6pre, time to mark as closed?
Thanks for your feedback. Yes, we should mark it as closed. As long as we do not know which patch fixed it I will mark it as WFM. Eventually Marco knows more about.
i'd say fixed by bug 447571
Makes sense. Even when we compare the 1.9.1 status. Fixed for 3.7 and 3.6.


Resizing then maximize Firefox windows does not resize search bar and bookmarks.
