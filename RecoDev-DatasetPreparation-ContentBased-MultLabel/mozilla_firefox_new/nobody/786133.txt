I still think that adding the manifest to the event.detail is the easiest way to add external manifests. This is better then to search link elements and download the manifest.

e.detail should become a parameter to activateFromOrigin:
let provider = Social.activateFromOrigin(providerOrigin, e.detail);

I have not completed this patch because my last comment https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809694#c16 was ignored.
Hi Axel,

I think we will take an approach like the one you describe when it comes time to implement this. But we've been focused on multiprovider support and fixes to the existing functionality, so we've not had time to look into this much. Supporting installation of arbitrary providers will require some additional UI work, so it's not quite as simple as making it work with the existing event (though that's certainly an important part of it). You can find me (and some other devs) on #socialdev on irc.mozilla.org if you want to chat about it more!
We'll need to outline our requirements around the manifest data.  While using the event is convenient, it is not discoverable and updating the manifest would be more difficult (ie. user has to browse to a page and initiate an action).
To make the manifest discoverable I think it is best put into some webfinger record 
 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger/
of the site hosting the social service. Or bake your own /.well-known/social-manifest.json

[In previous years Mozilla discourage addons that watch for webpage changes as being too expensive and slowing the UI too much. I would go this way: if social is enabled than attach to the DOMContentLoaded event of each page and parse the page once for <link rel="urn:mdn:social:manifest:1.0" href="someurl"/> or something like that.]

I don't understand your priorities regarding multiple providers and manifest discovery/addition. If the manifest has to be added magically to the preferences beforehand than I - as a social provider - have to write an addon to do that. If I have to write an addon anyway and then the social-integration does not help me much.
So I think that adding manifests through the event or through webfinger or whatever should be near the top of this team's priorities.
Maybe I failed to discover other ways to add manifests...?

To the point of updating manifests: I suggest to have a field in the manifest that provides an update url like in addon's install.rdf.

For the time being I would not require https for updateURL but maybe the manifest can be a signed json and the signing key be learned on "trust on first use"-basis using a json web key?

can we tweak these if conditions?  Eg, I see here that 'installType' may be 'foreign' or 'builtin' (and maybe others).  'foreign' is handled in the first if, but the else has a comment that it's "not builtin" - at face value, it looks like it *is* (possibly) builtin.

this looks wrong to me.  The directory origin is different than the origin of providers it allows you to install.  Don't we need to pass 2 origins here - the origin where the install is being done from, plus the origin of the provider being installed?

"validate" implies it returns a bool, but infact it returns the manifest itself.  Something like manifestFromData() seems like a better name

similarly to the comment for browser-social, how about a switch(type), with a default branch rejecting the manifest?  That would prevent future new values for 'type' breaking something if this code isn't updated accordingly.

I think we were smacked in the past for using URI.prePath - eg, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799600#c12.  I wonder if we should use
 nsIScriptSecurityManager.getSimpleCodebasePrincipal(in nsIURI aURI); to fetch the principal (which you fetch later anyway) and use the .origin attribute of that?  Or something :)

schedule() here probably isn't necessary - we are already in a callback, so there is no need to "pretend" we are async (which is what most of the other schedule() calls are for)

When a new provider has been installed you'll probably want to send an onExternalInstall event through the add-ons API to let the UI know something new has appeared (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Addons/Add-on_Manager/InstallListener#onExternalInstall%28%29)

Do we actually need this scary dialog, have you chatted with UX/security about it. I was expecting more of a simple popup notification to confirm an install and not needing to go this route.

I'm only using it for initial work on the functionality.  Bug 836452 is created to deal with that ui.

Thanks.  I got onExternalInstall working, but am floundering a little bit on uninstall.  I have to click remove twice to get it to actually uninstall, so I feel like I'm missing some notification, or that the provider class might be missing something.

This is quite complex - I wonder if the install stuff shouldn't be split into its own module, or somehow cleaned up to make it a little less complex to read and understand.  The test coverage doesn't look that great either, especially for error conditions.  Testing for a builtin provider having a manifest overridden also seems worthwhile seeing there is special support for that.

f+ on the general direction (but I'd probably r- in its current state if I was asked for that ;)

I'm a little confused by the need to pass both targetDoc.nodePrincipal.origin and node.baseURI - shouldn't they always refer to the same origin?  Also, is there a risk that evilsite.com will embed addons.mozilla.org in an iframe and fire an event on the iframe itself, meaning node.baseURI might be the addons site while targetDoc..origin will be evilsite.com?

Given SocialService names these params as "installOrigin" and "sourceURI", it's likely I am confused, so maybe some clarifying comments would be useful?

looks like we need to clear social.whitelist too?

this seems to be no longer just "builtin" manifests, but also any providers previously installed.

is the host really suitable here?  Don't we need the entire origin just incase there are 2 providers from the same host but different ports/schemes?

Also, why the .replace() - I'd guess we don't want "my-site.com" and "my_site.com" to use the same pref value.

you should probably either just switch to constants, or commit to using fixed strings and either way, delete this comment.

It's not obvious to me why it will fail.  Wont it just be treated as 'foreign'?  _manifestFromData doesn't seem to enforce what the comment implies.  The tests don't seem to cover this case (or indeed, many error cases at all)

it's not so much "invalid" as "missing"...  Also, given the complexity in the type handling, I wonder if we shouldn't also fail if baseURI has a value in this branch?

Isn't this comment and code reflecting bug 843862 rather than the current reality?  Do we really work correctly without a worker or without a sidebar?

shouldn't these both be mandatory?  Is there a usecase for a provider with an icon but no name?  Why would a provider not supply an icon, and shouldn't the impact of no icon on our UI mean we should just insist on one?

install, whitelist and directory patch

This version adds the activation tests from bug 838945.  They are actually important to the install functionality and belong here.  They also caught bugs in the install process which I fixed, as well as a couple minor bugs that have been included (note the chatbar and Social:ToggleNotifications changes).

I think it would be great if here we could also enforce this event to have originated in the top-level document only (i.e., no iframes). The origin checks and isHandlingUserInput already does a good bit of prevention but unless there are no existing plans with partners about using an iframe for activation, I think it'd be good to start with this requirement for now. And then we can look into easing the requirement later if it becomes necessary.

canActivateOrigin is gone but it's not clear to me if any of the installProvider() code automatically ties to the blocklist support added in bug 755126. If that's not the case, perhaps a good way would be to check it in this function and return "blocked" here to prevent installProvider to continue.

r+ if this is already happening automatically somewhere that I didn't notice (maybe with the usage of AddonInstaller/Wrapper), and with the iframe consideration above

Did this ever get security-review? Seems like it should, given that it adds a content-triggered install mechanism (also for things like parsing arbitrary content JSON).
Tagging Yvan to see if this was included in the existing SocialAPI code-review (bug 763941)
Any work related to that review significantly predates any of the work here, I think.

Is there any QA testing needed for this bug before we release?
It wouldn't hurt to check installation of multiple providers from a clean profile and the general interaction of those providers with each other and with Fx itself.
I've not encountered any regressions in provider activation and usage with Facebook, MSN Now, and Cliqz in the last week dogfooding on Firefox 22.
