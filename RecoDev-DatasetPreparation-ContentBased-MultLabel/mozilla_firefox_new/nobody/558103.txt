I have noticed while updating 1.9.2 nightly builds that my nightly 1.9.2 builds now identify themselves as "Lorentz" throughout. When the profile manager comes up, the start button says "Start Lorentz" and my build ID is Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4pre) Gecko/20100408 Lorentz/3.6.4pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729). Under the Help menu, it says "About Lorentz". 

It looks like the merge pulled in the code that we were using to identify the Lorentz build separately from the normal 1.9.2 builds.

I'm seeing the same thing on OS X as well, now that I've updated to most merge. The primary Firefox menu says "Lorentz" instead of Namaroka as well as the other issues that I mentioned above.
Default home page is also http://www.mozilla.org/projects/lorentz/.

I backed out the Lorentz branding. There's no need for this to block anything, though, since it only affects the nightly branding, not the release branding.
Sorry, my fault.
Marking this as .4-fixed as per comment 3


1.9.2 nightly builds identify themselves as "Lorentz" after Lorentz code merge
