latest builds of Minefield pressing F11 does not allow full-screen.  I starts to roll-up, then leaves the Navbar exposed, with the Minefield button showing through, and the windows (min/mzx/cls) buttons in tiny style in upper right. 

regression range:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=90b5a456b7ba&tochange=5da28c582cc7

This is going to be hard, as it has the TabCandy merge of 600+ patches.
Hopefully someone can figure which / what broke. 

Blocking b4 ?  or RelNote ?

Pal-moz got a slightly different regression range:

maybe caused by: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581813

Image showing change in top area besides the addition of the tab-candy button, layout looks higher:

never-mind - comment #2 is correct...
Seems to point to bug 581813 for sure. Getting rid of the margin makes things happy.
One potential fix would be to margin = 0 on fullscreen and restore it on exiting full screen. Or somehow fix up the animation to go all the way up. But the margin thing is a temporary fix anyway..
