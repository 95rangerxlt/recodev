Sorry if this is the wrong component.

I clicked on the "Share this page" toolbar button, which opened a panel allowing me to add Twitter, which I did.  This opened a tab in the background which shows a "Congratulations, Twitter is now activated in Firefox" message.  The title of that page is " for Firefox", so it looks like the site name isn't filled in there properly.

Looks like the <title> tag is incomplete. View source reveals <title> for Firefox</title>. It appears this is the only page with that issue.
fixed on the staging server, next push to the live server will have this.

"Congratulations, Twitter is now activated in Firefox" page has incorrect page title
