You can click outside the bounds of a toolbar button and still activate the button.

This is especially problematic since the theme looks like a unified toolbar so you are aiming for an indeterminate point to begin drag operations and wind up pushing the button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox (Mac)
2.Click above the reload button
3.Watch the page reload
Actual Results:  
Click is interpreted as button push

Expected Results:  
Click should be either ignored or (preferably) start a drag.

For comparison Safari's toolbar buttons accept clicks with a tolerance of about a pixel around the edge (roughly corresponding to the black pointer point, not the white border).

I can reproduce this (with the Home button as well as with the Reload
button).  It does seem to be a Theme problem.

It doesn't happen on Windows or Linux, but on those OSes FF3 uses a
different default theme (one where the Reload and Home buttons'
outlines accurately show but buttons' borders).

*** Bug 423341 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I can't reproduce this on current nightly, clicks only activate within the pixel boundaries of the toolbar buttons.
probably fixed by bug 559033


Toolbar buttons are clickable outside their drawn boundries
