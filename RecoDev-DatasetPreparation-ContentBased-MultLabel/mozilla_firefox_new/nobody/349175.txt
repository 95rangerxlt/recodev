When having a form (input text and input submit) with an onsubmit handler, trying to submit the same input without losing the focus on the input text, makes event.target be the form the first time, the input the next time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://oasi.upc.es/~kiusap/resourcetype/newResource.html
2.on the add functionality text box, write something (e.g. "bug"), then press enter
3.write the same thing again ("bug"), and press enter again (note you never touch the mouse nor the tab key, the input text always retain the focus)
4.If you look at the debug zone at the bottom and look for lines beginning with "addToList() started.", first time it is:
addToList() started. this = [object HTMLFormElement]. e.target = [object HTMLFormElement]
and the next time you wrote the same and pressed enter, it changes to:
 addToList() started. this = [object HTMLFormElement]. e.target = [object HTMLInputElement]

yes! e.target has mutated somehow.

5.without doing anything, try to enter one letter more and press enter again. now e.target has become again the FORMElement.
Actual Results:  
Sorry, the actual results are mixed in the steps to reproduce

Expected Results:  
e.target should not change depending on the input (therefore, should be HTML FORMElement always)

Odd. I suspect the Form Manager, since it's the only thing that should care whether you type the same thing the second time (fails) or something different (works), but the behavior's the same whether or not Form Manager's enabled.
I was able to reproduce this bug in Firefox 2.0.0.2 following the same steps
Testcase is a dead link,
Please provide new test case and advise if fault is still relevant to recent Firefox versions.
New link for testcase: http://campderros.com/resourcetype/newResource.html

BTW, works fine on Firefox 3.6/Windows XP SP3. Currently I have no access to any Linux Box, so I can't test this under the original OS of the bug.

I'm leaving this as solved, maybe I'll change it later if under linux still fails. Feel free to change it if you can test it before I can.


e.target on onsubmit differs on consecutive submits with the same input
