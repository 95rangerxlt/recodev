gTranslate's empty menu item with e10s enabled

When trying to translate something, the menu appears, but no translation happens. Works fine in a non-e10s-window.

Pierre, are you the developer of the "gTranslate" add-on? The add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Ally on this bug. MDN also has a good introduction:

Hi Chris, yes I am the main developer of the gTranslate addon, and I am in the process of rewriting it (~ 20% remaining), to make it restartless and E10S compatibleÂ [1].

I will update this bug as soon as there is some progress.
