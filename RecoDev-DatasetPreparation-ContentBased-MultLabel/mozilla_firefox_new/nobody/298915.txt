i get this when i'm trying to load firefox- and it doesn't start 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.run firefox 
2. 
3. 
 
Actual Results:  
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: ../sysdeps/generic/dl-tls.c: 72: 
_dl_next_tls_modid: Assertion `result <= _rtld_local._dl_tls_max_dtv_idx' 
failed! 

Expected Results:  
normal firefox start 

this maybe caused by the hotstuff i have on my linux-  maybe some packages i 
have are just to fresh
