modify packages-static to include bin/README

According to our build docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_a_Mozilla_Distribution#Add_The_README)
third party contributors are encouraged to place a README file in dist/bin/
before creating the actual package. In Firefox such a file never ends up in the final package though.

SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Sunbird, XULRunner and Fennec seem to include README
correctly in the package (at least on *nix).

v2 (so it applies cleanly to m-c again)

The landing of attachment 357623 (bug 459878) broke the initial patch on mozilla-central.
I don't think we should make this change on the basis of an out-of-date document. Other apps only include a README because they lack a packaging list and hence get everything in dist/bin (and even that's no longer true for SeaMonkey's upcoming 2.0).

I'm inclined to agree with Nick... what benefit do we get from shipping this file? That MDC article doesn't really provide rationale.
Those readme files tend to be quite informative in contributed tarballs,
especially those for the tier2 and tier3 platforms where there are no
official builds. Or is there another way to include that information in
the tarballs (without having to hack the build config)?

This patch is broken since the fix for bug 511642 landed.
bug 511642 caused us to ship README.txt on all platforms:
