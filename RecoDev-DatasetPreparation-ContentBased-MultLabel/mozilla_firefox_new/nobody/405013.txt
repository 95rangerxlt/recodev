The images on the navigation buttons are hidden, when resizer (between locationbar and searchbar) is moved to the most left. This happens when the location moves over the position of the navigation buttons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. press onto the Resizer and move it to the left as much as you can
2. release the mouse button
3. the images are hidden
4. now move it to the right again
5. the buttons still are compressed/hidden
6. restart firefox, everything will be fine again
