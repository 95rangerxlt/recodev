With a very recent build, loading firefox just gives a plain window with an XML undefined entity error.

The checkin for bug 327223 appears to have caused this by adding some entities that are not included in the locale, historyMenu.label and historyMenu.accesskey.

I think this should block turning on places on the trunk.

I backed out the offending change, which looks like an accidental commit.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
