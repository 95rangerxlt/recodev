There's still small bits like NotifyJSRunToCompletionStart, NotifyJSRunToCompletionStop and JavascriptTimelineMarker that exist inside nsDocShell.cpp, but that's just a matter of moving the code somewhere else.

Annoying to review code move + code refactoring change.
code moves should always happen separately.

Alright, splitting this up.

I hope I didn't miss anything. Comparing the code move and simultaneously making sure code refactoring is ok really makes this kind of review harder.
