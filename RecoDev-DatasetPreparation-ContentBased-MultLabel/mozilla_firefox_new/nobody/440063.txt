I've spoken offline with the developer of Tor Button but Polvi suggested I open this here, too, so here it is.

I have the same problem.

I had this issue as well.  The stated workaround was to disable the TOR button.  I did that but still could not sync.  After I uninstalled TOR I was then able to sync my bookmarks without any problems.
Just wanted to confirm Jeff's post above.  I too require un-installing Tor Button for my Foxmarks synchronization to work.
I've diagnosed this issue down to a function call wrapper that Foxmarks has for performance measurements. The problem is they were calling object method calls with apply and a null 'this' argument, instead of passing in an appropriate this pointer, which probably runs afoul of more stricter javascript context checking in firefox 3. The foxmarks author said he would fix the issue on their end. I imagine this probably shouldn't be a firefox bug, but I don't have the authority to close it.
I was able to get Foxmarks to work by simply Disabling TOR Button.  I did not have to completely uninstall it.
This has been fixed in Foxmarks 2.1.0.12, released 7/7/2008. Mike Perry, thanks for your help in diagnosing the problem.
