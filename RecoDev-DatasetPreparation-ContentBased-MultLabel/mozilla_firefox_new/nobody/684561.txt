We should add some margins between the filter buttons, and place the close button on the right-side.

See attached screenshot for details.

HUDService.jsm should append the close button to the end in the DOM (except for OS X maybe).

This should use ifdefs. Look for EXTRA_PP_JS_MODULES for how to enable this.

Why is !important needed here?
Does -moz-padding-end actually change something? I can't see it in the screenshots.

The !important rules were a carry-over from previous tweaks and weren't needed. Thank you for catching them.

I have attempted (and it appears I was successful), at using EXTRA_PP_JS_MODULES, but I am not sure if I used it the way that you meant.

I forgot to mention that -moz-padding-end is needed because there is a rule in toolbarbutton.css sets the padding to 2px on :hover:active, causing the toolbarbutton to shrink by 1 pixel.
Sweet! Thanks for doing this. :)
