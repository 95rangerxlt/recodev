While working on some other patch I bumped into this mochitest file and I saw the TODO. The fix looked quite easy for me to do, and here's the result.

The problem was that the test file used the DOMContentLoaded event which fires before images and scripts from the page are loaded. Besides that, it also had some errors in the way it tried to access the output content to check the presence of the logged requests.

I should note that by enabling the two tests, it did fail for me badly in both debug and opt builds, on Linux.

With this patch, the test runs fine in debug and opt builds.

I trust you also tested this after the xray wrapper landed. Looks like my brain had turned to mush when working on this, using the wrong eventHandler call.

Thanks for the feedback+!

I retested this patch today. Still runs fine, no problems with compartments landing.
