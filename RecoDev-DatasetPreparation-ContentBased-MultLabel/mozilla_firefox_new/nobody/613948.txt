STR:

1. Make sure the bookmark toolbar is showing
2. Open a new tab using the + button
3. Hover over a link in the bookmark toolbar
4. Type

Expected: characters that I type to appear in the location bar
Actual: autocomplete drop down appears matching those characters, but they characters themselves do not appear

Er, OK, testing some more, I notice that this only works when the link you hover over is a bookmarklet. Strange.
I think this is bug 613365, which was fixed Saturday night.  Did you see this in a more recent nightly?  I can't.
Not sure if it was the same as, but seems to be fixed-by, for sure.


typed characters do not appear when link preview is for a javascript: link / bookmarklet
