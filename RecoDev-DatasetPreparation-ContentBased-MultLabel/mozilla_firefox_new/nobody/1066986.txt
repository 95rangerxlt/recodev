Issue still present on Nightly 35.0a1 (2014-09-29).
I've checked the extension code and it looks like it's trying to access the web content from the extension. It should be reworked to use the multiprocess API.
The developer has been contacted through AMO.
Submitted version 3.0 to fix this bug.  Thanks.

Thanks for the email or I would not have seen the issue.
Thanks, Ryan! I'd like to keep this bug report open until color picker version 3.0 is published on AMO. That will avoid user confusion where this bug is marked "fixed" but AMO still shows color picker 2.1.

Once 3.0 is on AMO, feel free to close this bug as "fixed" or just remind me to do so in email, IRC, or this bug. :)
I don't have edit permissions, but this should now be RESOLVED FIXED (by me).
Thanks, Ryan. Resolving fixed because colorPicker version 3.0 is now live on AMO.
