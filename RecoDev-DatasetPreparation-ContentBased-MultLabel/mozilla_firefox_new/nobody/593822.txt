Looking at Firefox 4, a new control was added to main-window that is the parent of navigator-toolbox.

tab-view-deck is a deck that contains the controls and it has a vbox inside it that then contains all the toolbars.

The vbox inside tab-view-deck should have an ID associated with it so that CSS can be cleanly applied to the navigator-toolbox:

#main-window > #tab-view-deck > #MISSINGID > #navigator-toolbox

The vbox in tab-view-deck needs an ID so add-on developers can insert overlays in the vbox.  For example, the following XUL overlay does not work as desired; it inserts a second vbox after the first one under tab-view-deck:

  <deck id="tab-view-deck">
    <vbox>
      <toolbox id="my-addon-toolbox" insertafter="browser">
        <!-- toolbox contents here -->
      </toolbox>
    </vbox>
  </deck>
I think this bug should be marked FIXED,  
bc this was done in Firefox 6 already, it is <vbox id="browser-panel"> now. (I'm using it for xul overlay also)

Tks!
bug 610996 was the one that fixed it.
