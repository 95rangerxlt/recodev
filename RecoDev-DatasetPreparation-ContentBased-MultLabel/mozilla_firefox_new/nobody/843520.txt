User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130215130331

Steps to reproduce:

I opened ftp://ftp.rz.uni-wuerzburg.de/pub/tex/latex2e/contrib/numprint/numprint.pdf in Firefox 19.0.2. This also happens with some other documents compiled in LaTex.


Actual results:

Numbers throughout the program do not show up, e. g. in "version" on the title page.


Expected results:

All numbers are supposed to be displayed. The documentation above is for the LaTeX package numprint, I suspect that those numbers rendered by numprint itself are not shown. However, pdf.js ought to show the numbers.

Not reproducible for me with the latest Nightly, but I couldn't reproduce on 19.0.2 either. 
Reporter, can you please confirm that your issue is fixed in the latest Nightly (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/)?
Thank you!
The issue seems to be fixed as I cannot reproduce the bug on the latest Nightly. Thanks!
