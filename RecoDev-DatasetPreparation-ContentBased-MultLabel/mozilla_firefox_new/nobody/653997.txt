Test Case:
Prerequisites: Win7 64bit, with Aero turned on and also in Basic theme.
In FF4.0, create several tab groups and open a few tabs in each of the group.
Click on the FF icon on the task bar and watch closely the prefix to the page titles - which is the Tab Group name to which it belongs.

Expected Behavior:
Each page has a title prefix according to the tab group to which it belongs.

Observed Behavior:
See attached screenshot with annotations.
The page title prefixes (tab group names) are mixed between the pages, some are correct, some are not.
When you click on that page and it is maximized on the screen the page title prefix (tab group name) is the correct one. The problem is in the preview / list of the pages from the taskbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
In FF4.0, create several tab groups and open a few tabs in each of the group.
Click on the FF icon on the task bar and watch closely the prefix to the page titles - which is the Tab Group name to which it belongs.

User Agent Switcher addon is used (to display some pages with FF3.6.8 compatabilty), however even when it is on default that happens too, so I don't think it is related.

Vladimir, did you try to reproduce this with all add-ons disabled or in safe-mode? Maybe anyone else on Windows can confirm?
Hi, Tim,
I haven't tried to reproduce it with all add-ons disabled or in safe-mode.
Also another issue that could be related to that:
I'm using Win7 Basic theme mode (no Aero), and sometimes when hovering with my cursor over FF icon in the taskbar, it shows me a multitude of windows (for each window open in all my tab groups), but if I'd recently use the panorma button and go to one specific group, then it would show me only 1 icon/window. Aft4er a few alt-tabs to get back and forth to FF and switch between tabs, it goes back to displaying all the amount of windows I have open across all tab groups.
