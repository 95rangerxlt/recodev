STR:

Using Jamun Nightly (https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/jamun/rev/0362bdd57830) on Windows 7.

1) Open Firefox
2) Go to AppMenu > Options > Toolbar Layout to enter Customization Mode

What happens?

Customization mode is entered, but the menu panel is empty, and no items are in the palette. The error console says:

Timestamp: 28/03/2013 2:54:15 PM
Error: Error: No build area nodes registered for PanelUI-contents
Source File: resource:///modules/CustomizableUI.jsm
Line: 1348

This is because the panel lazily registers itself as a build area after it is first opened. In the STR above, the panel never got a chance to register itself.

The panel is special because customization mode *assumes* that the panel is available. We might have to do something similar and more generic for other lazy areas down the road, but until we get there, I think this should suffice.
I think it's OK to wait for this to land on UX in milestone 2.

Starting customization before panel opens causes customization not to work.
