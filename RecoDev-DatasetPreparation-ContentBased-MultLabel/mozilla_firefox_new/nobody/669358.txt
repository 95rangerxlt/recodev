I'm not sure that the reasoning is different between the firefox case and the web case is it?

Also there's a bug where we're using .gclihide to do this, but that's causing the prompt to disappear too, I'd raise a separate bug, but I think the solution is probably the same.

Grey background on GCLI input shouldn't be there on web build either
