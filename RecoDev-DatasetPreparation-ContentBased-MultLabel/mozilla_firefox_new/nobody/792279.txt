If you open a pdf document with pdf.js and you want to view it fullscreen, you can either press F11 or click on the fullscreen button on the pdf.js UI.
If you press F11, you still see the pdf.js UI, you can scroll with the mouse.
If you use the fullscreen button, you don't have the pdf.js UI, you can't scroll with the mouse, and you see a security prompt.
This is slightly confusing from the user's point of view, isn't it?

Oops doesn't seem to be duplicate, sorry :marco
Fullscreen button was renamed to "presentation mode" to avoid the confusion with Firefox "F11"-fullscreen mode. See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2153 and bug 794101.

Does the presentation mode now allow switching pages with mouse clicks? If not, I'll open another bug for that.

We are experimenting with mouse wheel at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2060 . What behavior for mouse click do you have in mind, just to show next page per click?

There is also bug 795228e.

Yes, this is what other readers do (and, so, what users expect). That's covered by bug 795228, thank you!


Fullscreen mode is inconsistent
