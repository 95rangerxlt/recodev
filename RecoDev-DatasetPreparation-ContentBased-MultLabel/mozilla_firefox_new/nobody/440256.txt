upon opening a youtube site with ff3
the video will just load for 2 sec
then it'll stop

no problem with previous ff2
same for many youtube / other video sites

when disable then enable flash plugin again
the problem can be solved for the current session

hope that this can be corrected in the subsequent ff3 updates

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on any video sites (eg. youtube)
2.video loads, but can only see the first 2 sec
3.video stops
Actual Results:  
video stops playing after 2 sec

Expected Results:  
video should be played for their own duration

when disable then enable flash plugin again
the problem can be solved for the current session
