The other day when i was at yahoo games firefox crashed as I was closing the browser. I filed a TB report but I do not have the # of it. Since then every time I open firefox it resets its screen size to the default (my screen resolution is 1440 x 900) which looks like 1024x768. All the search engines used in the search box are gone and reset each time I open the browser. All toolbars reset to default and when the browser is open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Change some setting
3.Restart Firefox
4.Settings are reset

Actual Results:  
All of the setting reset back to the default setting that you get when you initially install firefox.

Expected Results:  
All of my setting should have saved and been used as I restarted the browser.
