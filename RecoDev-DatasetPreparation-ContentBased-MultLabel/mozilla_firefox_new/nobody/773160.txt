expose a subset of navigator and add navigator specific tests

From https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770679#c2, we should not expose the full 'navigator' object to workers.

http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/workers.html#the-workernavigator-object lists what a real DOM worker gets, and our Frameworker should restrict things to this list.

expose a subset of navigator and add navigator specific tests and include __exposedProps__

This patch adds __exposedProps__ to the navigator object to prevent warnings.

backed out due to leaks
Created attachment 642489
Old patch neglected to call worker.terminate() which caused leaks in the test

Same as old patch except one line added:  worker.terminate();
New patch pushed as https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/6d2002bd64c5
Didn't make it to mozilla-central before the uplift (merge was blocked on bug 774259). Adjusting milestone accordingly.
