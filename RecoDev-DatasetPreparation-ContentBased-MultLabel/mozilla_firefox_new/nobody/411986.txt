Using the Nightly Tester Tools, I've overridden the maxvers on this and it seems to work fine to me.  Probably just needs maxvers bumped.
Maybe we should have an editor test it and bump the maxVer accordingly?
This addon no longer works. The developer knows of this and has released a test version at the bottom of this page: http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan-faq

For now anyways bumping the version is a bad idea, hopefully the developer will update the entry to the latest version once he is satisfied the test version is good.
Yeah, the one I bumped maxvers on was an older version.  When I updated to the current one, it broke.  I'm pretty sure that older version still works, if you bump maxvers, unfortunately I don't remember which version it was.

I just grabbed the test version you linked above, and it does indeed work correctly.

Also, just noticed the author does appear to have a Bugzilla account...  CCing them.
This is fixed?  I just picked up an update to it via the software update channels that claims it works in 3.1b2...
Yeah, the entry for it on the addons site says:

Works with:
    * Firefox: 2.0 â€“ 3.1b3


rikaichan not available for Firefox 3
