XMLHttpRequest is broken for all sites, that use it.
Didn't find a single working one, so i assume it's not them that are doing things wrong.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any site that uses AJAX
   like:
    - gmail (goes as far as freezing the browser)
    - google.com/ig (notice the rss-feeds)
    - demos.mootools.net/Ajax
Actual Results:  
XMLHttpRequest.Open() fails with:

[Exception... "'Permission denied to call method XMLHttpRequest.open' when calling method: [nsIDOMEventListener::handleEvent]" nsresult: "0x8057001e (NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_STRING)" location: "<unknown>" data: no]

or similar (shorter) error-message or in case of gmail freezing the whole browser.

Expected Results:  
XMLHttpRequest working as intended again.

testcase
This was fixed by the back-out of bug 418996. Should be verified before we ship because we still want to re-land that one
