repro:
1.Open FF
2.Open a url in the 1st tab
3.Open the second tab with menu_>New tab, ctrl+T or rightclick context menu->new
tab (leave it blank)
4.Close the blank tab

5.Try to reload or close the first tab, try to load a bookmark into it.
Don't bother to try anything, you'll fail

workaround:
open a new tab again and go back to the first, now you are allowed to do
anything you want.

gimme some time to find the regressor.

This was caused a fix for bug 249136 which has been backed out.
I am getting the JSC error, "Error: uncaught exception: 2147500037"
I am running FireFox v2.0.0.3 on MacOS X v10.4.10

This is happening when I am running an extension I am writing and I am curious if anyone can tell me what this error really means and how it was fixed for this bug.

Thanks.

Backing out fix for bug 249136 for now; it caused bug 303475, bug 303477 and bug 303479
