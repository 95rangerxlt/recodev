Alt-Tab is the key combination to switch applications, both in Windows and Linux. Firefox hides the menu bar as soon as Alt is pressed, even if another key is pressed before Alt is released.

That is a problem because there is no way to see the menus and be able to use the system-wide Alt-Tab. And also because using a shortcut will automatically hide the menubar.

It is also inconsistent because if the menu bar is already hidden, Alt+Tab or Alt+accesskey does not unhide it.

Curiously, it now does the (almost) opposite to me: bug 1044170.
Seems to be solved in 34 (Linux)


Pressing alt+tab to switch applications hides menu (Linux/Windows)
