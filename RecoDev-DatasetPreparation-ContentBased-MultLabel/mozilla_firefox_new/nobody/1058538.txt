hi Gabriel, if your team has any questions about add-on support for multiprocess Firefox (e10s), just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox

* Ally or Zombie: the CuddlefishLoader looks like part of the Add-on SDK and is a common source of e10s problems for add-ons. Can we fix the CuddlefishLoader itself or shim it in Gecko?

The problem is that the DDG add-on hits a `windows is null` exception when trying to install the toolbar button. If I install the add-on without e10s enabled and then enable e10s, the DDG toolbar button works correctly.

Cuddlefish is just the JS module loader used for SDK addons, and doesn't really have much to do with e10s, it just appears in most (all?) stack traces involving SDK code.

the problem here is in the selection.js module, which throws immediately upon loading. i filed bug 1060695 for that.
*** Bug 1070449 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The developer has been contacted through AMO.
Telemetry is reporting that DDG regularly throws an exception in context-menu.js line 690
might be work noting that the google translator addon also throws in context-menu.js ln 690. These could be very different files, but this looks suspicious to me.
translate this also throws in context-menu.js.

Seems to me that this is from SDK code. The updated exception line number points here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/addon-sdk/source/lib/sdk/context-menu.js#689

messageManager.sendAsyncMessage("sdk/contextmenu/createitems",...

This line seems to throw from multiple addons. How bad it is if this line fails? Should we look into this? Or is this a known issue maybe?
I just gave this add-on a try and it's working correctly on Nightly. Maybe this bug should be closed and the SDK issue should be moved to a separate bug.
It appears to be working fine for me in Aurora.
Closing this bug. The issue in comment #8 should be moved to a different bug, if it's really a problem.


"DuckDuckGo Plus" add-on can't install toolbar button when e10s is enabled (`windows is null` exception)
