At the referenced URL, on the line with the date "24 Aug 2000" the diacritical mark over the "a" in the word l√§n has been shifted to the right so as not to be directly over the "a". On the line with the date "7 Sep 2000" the same problem exists for the two diacriticals in V√§sterg√∂tland. F√§rgelanda (on a couple succeeding lines) has √§ shown correctly.
