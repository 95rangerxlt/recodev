Reproducable: Always
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download Fx/Tb 1.0.7 installer on Windows XP SP2 using Internet Explorer.
2. Double click installer.
Actual result:
Unknown publisher warning
Expected result:
Publisher: Mozilla Foundation

The problem doesn't expose yet about Fx/Tb 1.5 because they are signed using digital signature labeled as MoCo.
But it will expire 03 Nov 2006 similarly.
If products released just before expiration date, they would be out of date very soon.
We shoud timestamp the digital signature to avoid expiration fundamentally.
