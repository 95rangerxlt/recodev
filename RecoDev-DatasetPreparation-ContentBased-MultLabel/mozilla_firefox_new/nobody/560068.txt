This only affect facebook and no other sites, JS seem to work fine on other sites but only affects facebook

The problems:
* Can't share "what's on your mind" because the "Share" button even if clicked does nothing
* Chat doesn't work either since I can't click any names on the left to open a chatbox and instead it opens their profile page (the chat box in the bottom right doesn't even work)
* If there is a notification (Red number), it does open the sub-menu and allows you to click to the update but the number stays, it doesn't go away
* Can't "Like" comments because clicking it does nothing  and though clicking the "comment" button next to it opens a box, pressing the comment button after making a comment does nothing
* When you type in the "Search" bar, it should give hints but it does nothing for me even though it allows you to search


Note:
I have AdBlockPlus and NoScript and they are not affecting it.
They are all whitelisted and disabled on facebook so they are not the ones causing problem.
I have already tried "safemode" but the problem is still there.
There are no errors in the error console but there are a few warnings:

"Warning: Expected declaration but found '*'.  Skipped to next declaration.

"Warning: Unknown property 'zoom'.  Declaration dropped.

Reproducible: Always

ok, it seems it somehow collides with the Java plugin (Add-on) and disabling that resolves the issue as per blocklist (https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/blocklist/) as per bug 558584


My Facebook "javascripts" won't work even if site is whitelisted in Noscripts and ABP
