While working on bug 744470, noticed we have timeout activity before we paint the browser. They take up to 100ms on my slower laptop:
chrome://browser/content/search/search.xml:66 timeout took 3ms firstpaint:0
chrome://browser/content/search/search.xml:514 timeout took 11ms firstpaint:0
I think these are http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#108 and http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#556

A hacky way to fix stuff like this is to use mozrequestanimation frame
fixed by bug 760035
