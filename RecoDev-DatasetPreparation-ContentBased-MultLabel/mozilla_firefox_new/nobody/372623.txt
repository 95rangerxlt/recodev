call updateChevron on content resizes

Reproduction steps:

1. /view/toolbars/ - uncheck bookmarks toolbar
2. close firefox, and re-open
3. /view/toolbars/ - check bookmarks toolbar

Results: the only visible element is the chevron, which contains all toolbar items.

Expected results: only overflowed items should be chevron'd

This patch allows chevron updates on content resizes (for when toolbar is shown/hidden).

This patch also caches the toolbar size from the previous check, and only updates the chevron when that size has changed.

nit: Add a "lastWidth" xbl field (initialized to 0) and then make that
>+          if (this._lastWidth == totalWidth)

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
