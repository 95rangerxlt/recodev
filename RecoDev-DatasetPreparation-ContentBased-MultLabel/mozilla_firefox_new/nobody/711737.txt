Review of attachment 582562:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Patch looks good. Thank you! In the same folder there's a README file that tells which Orion version is used and it lists which patches are applied on top of it. Please mention this bug as well.
While this patch may be a valid short-term solution to a specific problem, I would like to note that:

1) This is not future-proof as new CSS properties, which appear (and disappear) 3-4 times a year, will need to further, non-automatic, patching.

2) This sets the problem of the inclusion rule: what is the criteria to be eligible to be in that list. I see:
  - Experimental & Implemented CSS properties which are unlikely to be removed (animation, ...) but are still used prefixed.
  - Experimental & Implemented CSS properties that are already removed from latest drafts (box-* from the flex box model).
  - Experimental & not implemented CSS properties which may (or not) be removed in the future from the spec (like hanging-punctuation)

I don't see
  - Experimental & not implemented CSS properties which will very likely be implemented (flex-* from the new flex box model)
  - Proprietary / implemented CSS properties which are unlikely to be added to the standard (-moz-float-edge which was renamed float-displace in spec draft and removed from it later or the proprietary scrollbar-* IE properties)
  - Experimental & implemented CSS properties like user-select (implemented prefixed by IE)

and so on.

There are also non-HTML specific extension (like for SVG or EPub).

What do you think is the long-term valid solution?

Your concerns are valid. Thank you for taking the time to express them here.

> What do you think is the long-term valid solution?

We are aware of the problem and this is only a short-term solution such that we can get an improved experience into the developer tools of Firefox 11.

The long-term solution is being worked on upstream. The Orion team is preparing a new CSS highlighter that we hope will address most of the concerns. See:

It missed the Firefox 11 release for 10 minutes.

missing CSS properties in our source editor. Minor impact, but a good bit of polish. Low-risk.
May be I am wrong about the Firefox 11 target because this changeset is between:
* The latest changeset in 11.0a1/20111220: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2afd7ae68e8b.
* The first changeset in 11.0a2/20111220: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a8506ab2c654
I was wrong about the missed Firefox 11 target.
