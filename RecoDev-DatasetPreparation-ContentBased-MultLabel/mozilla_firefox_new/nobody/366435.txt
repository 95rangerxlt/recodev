When I use the keyboard to manipulate a combobox in an HTML form, the children of the combobox disappear from the AT-SPI hierarchy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open HTML file (to be attached to this report)
2. Run at-poke and find the combobox in the form.  Notice that it has children.
3. In Firefox, tab to the combobox.  Press Alt+Down to open it. Press Alt+Up to close it.
4. Go back to at-poke.  Try to find the children of the combobox.
Actual Results:  
The children of the combobox disappear after it has been manipulated from the keyboard.

Expected Results:  
The children should not disappear.

I'm not sure, but since I've been working on comboboxes this week, this might actually be the source of the crasher for bug 366434.

Test case.
Please note that this doesn't occur when using the mouse.  You must use the keyboard.
Interesting. I suggest trying again with today's build, since I just fixed how HTML combo box caches it's children in bug 278034.
Seems to be resolved in my tests with Gecko/20070115 Minefield/3.0a2pre this morning.  Thanks!


In HTML forms, combobox children disappear from hierarchy after combobox is activated from  keyboard
