Yeah, not sure what the issue is here, since loading up this page in FF 3.6.8 reports no errors at all in the Error Console. A refresh of the page in the 08/24 nightly for Firefox 4 returns the following console errors:

Going to post this on the site's support forum as well so hopefully their devs can take a look. This definitely appears to be JS changes between FF3 and FF4 that's the culprit here though.
Probably I've got the same error on this (german) Page:
http://vid.buffed.de/v/tHeI18ASW2E/buffedShow/buffedShow-207/

With FF 4 beta 4 and 5 (not tested earlier beta-versions) instead of showing the Flash-Video there's only a white Flash-frame.

Expected:
First this side shows a short add-video an then the main-video.

It workes in FF 3.6 and any other browser. When testing make sure you don't try to block adds, since this may interfere with the add-video.
http://media.giantbomb.com/media/vine/js/base_10031.js  starts with "use strict";

Maybe same as Bug 607188. and Tech Evangelism .
Fixed by the website author. Closing.


Flash video player doesn't display on website giantbomb.com
