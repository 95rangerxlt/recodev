The WebGL game BananaBread broke with recent commits. The textures are strange colors and the running/weapon animations are incorrect.

Can you post a screenshot of the brokenness?
Created attachment 8669535
Screenshot showing all the new issues (texture, running animation, and gun)

I originally discovered the bug on a Windows box, but the screenshot was taken in Linux, so this is a cross-platform issue.
Chrome also has the same problem. If you look at the console while the game is loading, there are errors about the shaders not compiling because of invalid '#pragma's.

I'm inclined to close this as won't fix.
Or move to tech evangelism to have the authors fix it on the shader side...
Are those pragmas in fact invalid? They used to compile without issue, was the previous behavior incorrect then?

If they are invalid, I can update BananaBread to fix that. I don't know a huge amount about shader language, though, so I'm not sure what is wrong in those shaders or how to fix them.

Note: this broke emscripten's browser.test_sdlglshader2 test as well, same issue.
It looks like ANGLE is being too strict and has since been fixed upstream. I'm planing on landing an update soon that should give us this fix.
This should be fixed now.
