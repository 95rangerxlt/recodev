because the highlighter is obscuring the tree panel? This is known. We're waiting on a patch from Neil to support an "always on top" feature in XUL panels. We may have to add the attribute to the panels as I don't believe it's in there yet.

Thanks for filing this!
Is this the "Window level" referred to here?

https://wiki.mozilla.org/XUL:Panel_Improvements

According to that page, "The 'parent' and 'top' levels are already implemented."
I'm already using it, but it doesn't seem to work.

this should be now fixed as a result of the titlebar bug.
