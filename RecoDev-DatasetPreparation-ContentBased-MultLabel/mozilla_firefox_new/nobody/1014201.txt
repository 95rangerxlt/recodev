The updated interactions and visual design of the in-content prefs are an incremental improvement and won't introduce any more visual inconsistencies within the product that aren't already present between {windows preferences, error pages, about: pages, add-ons manager, about:healthreport, about:home}.

There is potential that there may be small tweaks (such as consistent background colors) that can be done to other in-content pages to help bring the designs closer. A breakdown of the potential work there will need to happen.

The goal of this bug (bug 1014201) is to fix only the most minimum set of bugs necessary to ship the new in-content-prefs. New enhancements can be fixed any time, but they will not be prioritized higher than the work that is blocking us from shipping our first version.
Shouldn't this be marked Fixed now that Firefox 38 shipped with in-content preferences?

Yeah, we can close this. We still want to get the remaining dependencies fixed though.
