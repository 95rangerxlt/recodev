I have reported this problem.
http://bugzilla.mozdev.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15378
Well then, could you please set this bug to "confirmed"? I am not authorized to do so, I can only file new bugs :-)
What the h*** is this bug doing in the mozilla bugzilla?  LiveHTTPHeaders is a mozdev project, with it's own bugzilla -- go report the lack of LiveHTTPHeaders for FF2.0 there.  And if this bug had been properly researched, the reporter would have seen that this problem had been reported on the LiveHTTPHeaders bugzilla _and_ a proposed patch and .xpi have been made (see http://bugzilla.mozdev.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15235, attachments 4 & 5).  I have personally installed this testing .xpi, and it works fine.  So, the reporter should have researched this problem on the mozdev bugzilla, reported the problem to the extension developer(s), and added the bug to the mozdev LiveHTTPHeaders bugzilla -- not the mozilla bugzilla.  I recommend that this bug be marked as 'INVALID'.
We are also tracking several non-compatible extensions in Mozilla's Bugzilla. It will not be marked INVALID.

What is the status of getting LiveHTTPHeaders compatible with Firefox 2.0? I see the patches, but is the extension's author actively looking into the patches, committing them, and releasing a new version?
Thank you for the information.  I wasn't aware that LiveHTTPHeaders was being 'tracked.'  What is the criteria for an extension to 'tracked', and what extensions are being 'tracked'?

As regards the 'status of getting LiveHTTPHeaders compatible with Firefox 2.0,' I'm afraid I'm as clueless as everyone else.  While I have an interest in using LiveHTTPHeaders, I'm afraid that I don't have anything to do with the development (if any) process.  The best I can offer is you drop a note at http://bugzilla.mozdev.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15235 or contact Nils Maier (MaierMan@web.de) (he's the guy who made the xpi attachment on the bug report).
