*** Bug 547422 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Looks pretty good now that bug 482692 is fixed except for the top border being a black line when the menu is open.
The top border is less transparent than the side and bottom borders (50% opaque instead of 40%), but that's the case for the pressed states of the other buttons as well.
I guess this is more noticeable on menu-buttons then because the left border doesn't change on pressed states so the top border sticks out as being darker than the right and bottom borders.
Anyway, closing this, for the reported issue has been fixed.
