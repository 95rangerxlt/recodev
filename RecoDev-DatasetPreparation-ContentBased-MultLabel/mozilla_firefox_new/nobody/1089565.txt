* Animate the resizing
* Having a delay before resizing

While approving tracking request for bug 1047613 I noticed that this related bug is not nominated for tracking. Adding a FF41 tracking flag.
this is one of the possible solutions for bug 1047613, it might even be fine to just track that one.
Unified Complete was disabled for FF41. Untracking for FF41 and setting status to unaffected like https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1180205
this was fixed in bug 1047613.
