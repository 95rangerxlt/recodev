Have you tried right clicking the toolbar, and checking off "Hide toolbars"?
Does this happen when you start in Firefox Safe Mode? Or a new profile.
Seeing this too. Could be a regression from bug 484488 (and maybe a dupe of bug 502133).
I see this also but it only happens when the location bar or search bar had focus when I went into full screen mode.  To hide the toolbars manually (or automatically) focus has to be on the page content instead of on one of the toolbars.
This happens with a new profile.

Right clicking the toolbar and unchecking "Hide toolbars" does nothing.  Rechecking "Hide toolbars" also does nothing.  The right click menu also contains "Exit full screen mode"  which is broken and that is bug 502133.
Ignore my comment #4.  I can confirm this bug on Vista.
Bug 484488 was backed out last night and that back out fixed this bug.
Not worth checking for a regression range for an already fixed bug.


Full screen mode is no longer full screen--location bar and tab bar are always shown.
