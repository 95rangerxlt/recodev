Yeah, I know. There's also a missing arrow next to the Tools->FoxyProxy Standard menu item. I'm open to patches or at least guidance on how to fix it. The relevant code is here:
http://fisheye2.atlassian.com/browse/foxyproxy/trunk/src/content/overlay.js?r=578#l618
This dynamically builds the menu not just for Tools, but also for the context-menu (right-click), and the menu that's displayed when FoxyProxy is clicked in the statusbar.
Attached screenshot of Tools menu in Ubuntu. You can see the missing arrow but alignment is proper AFAICT.

I suspect I'm not using the right CSS classes on the menu and menuitem elements. I don't know.
