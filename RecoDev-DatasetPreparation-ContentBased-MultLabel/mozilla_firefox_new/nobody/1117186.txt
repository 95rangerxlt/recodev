This was called out in bug 1102416 comment 3, and then punted on because Firefox didn't need it in bug 1102416 comment 5. This temporarily caused bug 1108627 for Fennec until we just disabled geo-specific defaults entirely there.

It's likely that Fennec will want geo-specific defaults eventually (maybe soon), so we should fix this properly.

Does this mean we just need to make the defaultEngine setter be region-aware?

WIP: This changes the nsSearchService.defaultEngine getter and setter to be aware of the regional preference.

Update the preferences so we use the US-only search defaults when appropriate.

LGTM, although I think it would be nicer to abstract this into a single place - something like a getGeoSpecificPrefName() as mentioned in bug 1108627 comment 10.

Also, it could also be argued that we should remove the check for browser.search.geoSpecificDefaults from getIsUS() and have it inside that new getGeoSpecificPrefName() helper - that would make getIsUS() accurate even when that pref disables geo specific defaults.  It probably doesn't matter much though while getIsUS() isn't exported and is only used in the context of geo specific defaults, but it sure *sounds* cleaner and more future-proof.
We've got bug 1109118 on file to clean this stuff up - I'd love to see it on an upcoming desktop priority backlog!

I made both of Mark's suggestions in this patch. I could also just use the simple patch if Desktop doesn't want this much churn.

Also, we should probably consider just the simple patch for uplifting to beta.

Nice improvement.

getIsGeoSpecificDefaults is a weird name, how about geoSpecificDefaultsEnabled?

You can hoist the getGeoSpecificPrefName call outside of the loop (optionally do some s/var/let/s here too).

The "North America" comment in region.properties isn't quite right since bug 1109120, so I would adjust that to match the "US market only" comment in mobile.js.

Looks fine to me. Did you sort out the search activity issues?

> Looks fine to me. Did you sort out the search activity issues?

No. That's the next step...

But before that, I see Try fialures for testSearchSuggestion:


And trying a build with everything in place does not seem to be working as expected:
1. I don't see a browser.search.countryCode preference
2. I see a browser.search.isUS = false
3. The awesomescreen is still using Yahoo as the default, and showing search suggestions. If iUS = false, we should be using Google.
4. Looking at Settings > Customize > Search, I see the correct order: Google (default), Yahoo, Bing

Here is a snippet of my logcat:

Did you intend to change this?

To match this?

Not sure if that's related to your failures but it seems odd.

Good catch. I am updating and will make a new Try push:

regional-search-properties v0.4

We found a few problems in the previous patch:
* defaultengine was still Yahoo and not Google
* I copied pasted the ".US" overrides but failed to change the chrome:// URI to the correct location for mobile.
* We had disabled the geoip.url which stopped fetching the countrycode.

These are all corrected here and this seems to work correctly on my test devices.

Let's see how the Try build works:

Unfortunately this creates issues: These 4 new keys are reported as missing by compare-locales, and the last thing we want/need is localizers trying to add them in their locales.

We need to patch both mobile's filter.py to ignore these keys.
