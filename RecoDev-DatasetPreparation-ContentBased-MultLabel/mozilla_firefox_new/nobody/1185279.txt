I've been using the "Send Tab to Device" extension to send pages between Fennec on my Android phone and the e10s Nightly on my Windows desktop. It has mostly been working well until recently when it stopped being able to send any tabs over. Sync's "Refresh" button did not help.

Note that my desktop Nightly's Sync was not configured to sync anything automatically -- all check-boxes were clear in about:preferences#sync.

I fixed the issue by change the desktop Sync configuration to sync Bookmarks, and then I hit "Refresh". Immediately, all the tabs I had tried to send over during the last month appeared in the browser.

The Browser Error console didn't seem to have any relevant error messages.

/cc Mark who is probably the best person to advise here.  It sounds like maybe a recent change has prevented sync from fetching its command channel if all the sync datatypes are deselected?

Vladan, do you have any sync error logs in "about:sync-log" that might shed some light on the behaviour?
I suspect you will find a preference services.sync.enabled is set to false - the setup process recently changed to set this if no engines are enabled. We actually did this for "reading list", so maybe we can remove that, but in the meantime, the plugin could set this to true.

Yes, that's what it was

Yes I can report this to the SendTabToDevice authors

Only when I configure Sync to sync bookmarks:

Should I file a separate bug for the above issue?
Thanks for the update!

That's bug 1182366 (although we currently don't have any insight into which bookmarks are causing this problem yet)
I added a prompt to the Send Tab to Device extension:

Would it help if I sent the list of bookmarks I have in these profiles? I have maybe 10 bookmarks total. I have deleted a lot of bookmarks to try to resolve this problem, so there's no guarantee the issue isn't server-side only at this point.

That would probably help, thanks. It would also be awesome if you could test again once bug 1182366 lands - the patch there skips one problem but may then hit others.

Sync stopped wokring: "Send tab to device" stopped working until I changed sync settings
