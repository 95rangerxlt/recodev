It looks like the code to allow treating selected link-like text as a link for context menu things like Open in Tab didn't think about what should be done when you have both selected text, and a right-click on a link.

STR:
1. Open http://tests.themasta.com/tinderboxpushlog/
2. Find a failed test run (that's the easy part) and click on the orange letter to open the summary
3. Select the text of the filename for the first failing test, like test_pluginstream_asfile.html
4. Right click, select "Search Bugzilla@Mozilla.org for test_pluginstream_asfile.html" (with a sane pref to open searches in a new tab)
5. In the tbpl page, without clearing the selection, right click the "View Brief Log" link, and select "Open Link in New Tab"

Expected:
The tinderbox log loads in a new tab.

Actual:
http://www.test_pluginstream_asfile.html/ fails to load in a new tab, since our test filenames tend not to also be domain names.

Should be simple, taking.

patch & test

Dao, you reviewed the patch for this before. This is a simple patch that bypasses the plain text linking if there's a link in the popup node. Comes with a test!
Works perfectly for my use case, anyway :)
I haven't been at my computer for a while, gonna have to ask someone to check this in for me :)

Context menu while right-clicking a link should open the link, not link-like text that happens to be selected



Bug 526952 - Check if we're on a link before using the selection for the context menu, r=dao
