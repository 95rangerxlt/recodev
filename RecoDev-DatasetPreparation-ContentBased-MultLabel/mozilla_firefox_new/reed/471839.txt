Bug 461979 changed some of the URLs used in the bookmarks file, but there's a couple of changes I'd like to change to what it did.

* Change https://add-ons.mozilla.com/ to https://addons.mozilla.org/
* Change http://@AB_CD@.fxfeeds.mozilla.com/ to http://fxfeeds.mozilla.com/.

Not sure who should review this, so tagging Pike.

Why? The former was established as the convention for in-UI references, IIRC.

Nope, we stopped doing that for AMO a long time ago... Just look at firefox.js and see all the prefs that use https://addons.mozilla.org/ now. Plus, I have bug 454300 open to fix the rest. It doesn't make sense at all to redirect through a DV SSL cert in order to get to an EV cert at AMO. If we're going to get any use out of EV at all, we should go directly to the domain that has the EV cert.

r=me.

Note that this doesn't reduce any of the requirements on our server architecture, as we're not changing existing bookmarks. And the links in the existing bookmarks need to continue to work.

Changing them would actually make our support requirements on the server side less transparent, and add more entry points to maintain in the future, so I'm not sure if this is a good thing to do.

We'll continue to support old URLs, but this means we send users through less round-abouts, which is always a good thing.
