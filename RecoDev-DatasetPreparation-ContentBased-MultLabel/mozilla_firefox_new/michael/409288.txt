Secure icons
Just wanted to point out that we have new versions of these after a review my the mozilla art team, sorry. If you want to see or check in the new versions, I'll attach a new tar. No promise that they are final this time (well, they should be...)
Once you know for sure about the final version, then attach it. I'd also prefer you attach the images separately.

Reed: Ok. Should I file one big bug with all the remaining icons after the M2 set is approved (It's 99% ready now)? Or do you prefer individual bugs?

one bug would probably be best... it doesn't really matter, but I think one bug would be ok. :)
This is already done, see bug 413471, closing.
