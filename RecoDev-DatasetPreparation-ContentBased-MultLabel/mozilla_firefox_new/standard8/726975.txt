The fix

This patch does several things:

- Replaces the shell execution for APP_VERSION with a simple use of MOZ_APP_VERSION
- Groups DEFINES that aren't flag dependent in one section
- Tidies up the LOCAL_INCLUDES into one block rather than separate lines
- Removes the -DDEBUG flag to the splash.rc files, I couldn't see it being used anywhere.
- Removes the forced-copying (rather than symlink) of mangle and shlibsign for Mac bundles. We never use mangle, and shlibsign is used outside of the directory, but seems to work as a symlink anyway.
