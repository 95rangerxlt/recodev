The fix

Bug 686466 made application.ini a static file. However, it missed removing some of the calls to NS_New(Native)LocalFile that were only required for reading the application.ini from disk when -app wasn't passed.

This patch removes that, it also removes some includes that are not required.

This does more than advertized. The nsBrowserApp.cpp part is also missing.

You want to do that in mobile/xul/app/nsBrowserApp.cpp, and b2g/app/nsBrowserApp.cpp, too.

Nit if we're doing this, we no longer use exePath in do_main, might as well stop calling it with that. (We still need to calc it for the XPCOM startup)

Addresses the various comments. I've also pushed to try to confirm at least the mobile changes are right (I just applied the patch there).
