Fix errors in the test

This fixes the errors in the test, moving misplaced brakets so the error message is an argument for ok() and not the function in the expression.  Also changed an ok(foo != bar) to isnot(foo, bar).

Hmm, bzexport didn't update the patch description, so whoever checks it in will have to add the bug number & description.
