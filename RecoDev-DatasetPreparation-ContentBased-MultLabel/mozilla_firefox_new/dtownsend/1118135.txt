STR:
1. Click the search field's magnifying glass icon.
2. The search field's dropdown menu will open.
3. Click the search field's magnifying glass icon a second time.

RESULT:
The dropdown menu will reopen, but it should close (like it used). This bug is probably a regression from the search field's new "magnifying glass with plus symbol" icon.

Sounds potentially related to/caused by bug 1103455.
Almost certainly yes, should be straightforward to fix though.

/r/2321 - Bug 1118135: Clicking the magnifying glass while the suggestions are open should close the popup and not re-open it.

One thing I didn't mention in the commit message yet, I moved one of the tests to the end of browser_searchbar_openpopup.js as using synthesizeNativeMouseClick there was somehow causing the following test to timeout on Windows XP debug only. Never figured out why but putting at the end seems to solve the problem for now.

Would it work if you used the `popuphidden` event to set `_isHiding` back to false instead of using the setTimeout?

No, popuphidden fires before any of the mouse events make it to the DOM

Not sure who marked 36 as unaffected, both 35 and 36 are affected but we're too late for 35 now.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 1103455
[User impact if declined]: Clicking the magnifying glass just closes then re-opens the search popup
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: Automated tests running on m-c since landing
[Risks and why]: Low risk, the only in-product piece of this is to ignore click events when certain other events have happened recently. Worst case in some instances clicking the magnifying glass might not open the popup at all but we have automated tests covering the common cases of that.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

Clicking search field's magnifying glass icon no longer dismisses search field's dropdown menu
