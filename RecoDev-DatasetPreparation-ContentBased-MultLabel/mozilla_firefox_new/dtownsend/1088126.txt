Firefox Contextmenu Bug before & after  dragging tab to new window.png

Story:
Clean Profile
Start Session, open multiple tabs (I used www.heise.de and its children)
Drag one Tab from the primary window.
New Window gets created
Context Menu of new tab in new window shows all possible menu items.

Expected behavior:
Show applicable context menus

Reproducible: Always on this build ID

Sorry wrong bug should have been bug 1012784
Neil, is this fixed by bug 1060529?
No, this is due to the error:

JavaScript error: resource://gre/modules/BrowserUtils.jsm, line 95: TypeError: elt.syncHandler is null

Presumably, that field isn't being copied over when switching to a window.
*** Bug 1097208 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Going to fix this with a patch in bug 1087966
Fixed by bug 1087966
This will be verified in bug 1087966.
