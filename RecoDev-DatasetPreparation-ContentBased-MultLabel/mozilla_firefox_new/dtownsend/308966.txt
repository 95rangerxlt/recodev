When the options window is not in instant apply, the warn checkbox doesnt enable
and disable with the radio button setting until the options window is closed and
opened again.

I have a fix in progress.

Patch

A change event is necessary so the onchange handler on the preference is
called. The call to updateElements is then unnecessary since that will happen
in the change handler in the preference binding.

Second patch

On second thoughts. It's only sensible to fire the change event when there is
an actual change, not the situation when we set the preference's value at the
start. There we should only update the elements.
