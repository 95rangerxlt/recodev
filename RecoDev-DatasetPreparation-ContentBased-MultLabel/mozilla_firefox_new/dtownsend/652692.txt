This was here to add the browser menu to the extensions manager window back when it was a separate window. Now it is just useless.

Isn't it still possible for the dialog to be opened as a separate window? nsBrowserGlue.js seems to do that:

I guess changes to the structure of extensions.xul broke the overlay anyways (no longer a <window> with ID "extensionsManager"), but perhaps we should fix it instead of getting rid of it?
Huh, I don;t think that code can be used anymore and I thought we had removed it already. I'll be replaced by the third party work that is coming. I'll update this patch to remove it. We shouldn't be opening the add-ons manager in a window in Firefox anywhere now.
