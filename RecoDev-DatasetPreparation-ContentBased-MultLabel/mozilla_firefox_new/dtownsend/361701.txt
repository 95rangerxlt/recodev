This problem has recovered by backout of the patch.

force visibility when not animating

When a prefwindow is set to animate the default opacity for a prefpane is 0. So when the first pane doesn't animate we must make it visible.

Remove default visibility settings

The current state of the code doesn't actually use the opacity settings from the stylesheets. The first pane should be opaque anyway (this bug), and when animating to the next pane its opacity is set to 0 as it is selected.

The animate attribute only appears to be used as part of the selector in the stylesheet.

This has been tested with no noticeable visual regressions on a windows machine.
bug 355469 was backed out from the branch so this is no longer an issue there.
