When I click the Restart button belonging to the Restart Tabbed extension, Firefox launches every tab twice.

- Install Restart Tabbed https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2347/
- Restart and go to a certain page, e.g. Google
- Click Restart Tabbed button
- Result: Firefox launches two tabs with Google
- Click the red windows close button and start Firefox again
- Result: Firefox launches two tabs with Google instead of homepage

- Uninstall the extension
- Click the red windows close button and start Firefox again
- Result: Firefox launches two tabs with Google instead of homepage
- Click the red windows close button and start Firefox again
- Result: Firefox launches two tabs with Google instead of homepage

Not yet found out how to stop this behaviour. I also think I saw some crash without talkback while testing this but I'm not sure anymore. Can't repeat the crash.

Regression between 1.9a1_2006061717 and 1.9a1_2006061721.

I'll take a wild guess that you have Firefox's session saving enabled and as such both this and that extension are trying to restore the same set of tabs, so you get them all two times.

Since this is an issue with an extension I see no reason why this bug should remain open. If you do get a crash again then reopen and provide the talkback ID.

No, I have the normal default settings and this is a regression as I described in comment 0.
In Firefox 2 it behaves normally.
In trunk the pref browser.sessionstore.resume_session_once is automatically turned on again after every browser restart since 17 June.

Bugs invoked by extension features are INVALID by a general rule unless the author can identify what behaviour is not working according to expectation.  I'm betting the changes to the session service on trunk caused this, and those changes will hit branch soon.

For app-initiated restarts, we will always restore the session where possible.

Reset resume_session_once

The problem is nothing to do with the extension at all and should reveal itself with the EM restarts etc.

The resume_session_once pref is never reset when used to restore the session once.
A workaround is a user.js with
user_pref("browser.sessionstore.resume_session_once", false);
but that may not be surprising.

Reset resume_session_once

looks good, thanks. mconnor said i could hijack review on this, so r=me.
I'll check this in today when i sync the branch to the recent trunk changes.
Saw on bonsai that the patch was checked in.
