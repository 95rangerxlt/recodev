Switch to new WebIDE scanner / runtime API

I think we want to get away from Devices.jsm, don't we?

Sorry I didn't catched that in previous review.
It appears to fail with my unagi and Fx36+. 
(On Fx35-, we use old shell commands that work on more hardwares)

Otherwise it looks good codewise.

Updated PR with your latest comments.

I hope it now works on Unagi.  It's tricky to test this, since different devices include different sets of commands!  Thanks for catching that.

You did not say anything about the FxOS detect commands, so I hope "test ..." worked correctly on the Unagi.

Thanks, it works great on unagi now. (Yes, other commands like `test` exists on it)
