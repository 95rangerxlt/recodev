Ryan, are you the developer of the "Pushbullet" add-on? The add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Ally on this bug. MDN also has a good introduction:

Yep, I'm the developer. Thanks for the heads up, I'll take a look and get us working asap.
Pushbullet works just fine here (OS X 10.10, Firefox 37.0a1, Pushbullet v38). I think this bug can be closed, unless somebody else is facing this problem too.
Thanks for testing, Theodore! I'll mark this bug FIXED now.
