I was going to ask if you could think of a way to add a test for this functionality, but looks like one of the existing tests is having this happen.  Could you fix this test failure and then add a new one that just opens and aborts a connection, expecting the normal destroy process to happen?

Can we use events.once for all connections?  Or is there an advantage to using addOneTimeListener when it is available.

There is no advantage.  The issue is that the client vs. server expose different event APIs. :(

Bug 1042642 aims to clean up the APIs.  I added a comment here referencing that bug.

Thanks bgrins for extra help with Web Console tests!
https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/3197/#review3465

I changed the overall approach here from last time.  Now, there are no more events, so the design is simpler.  Instead, the client loops over the set of fronts in the pools it has after the connection is closed, calling `cleanup` on them.

I realized after the previous review that no fix is needed on the server side: it already performs a similar `cleanup` like this after connection close.

Looks good! A contributor ran into the automation panel not rendering before the test wrapped up causing some failures, so you should also check browser_wa_inspector-width.js as well, which has a similar fix (but your method is cleaner).

I'll likely also land this on fx-team too, it seems generally correct.

r+ for beta-only (assuming a green try push).

We will need a different patch for fx-team that simply removes the thisTestLeaksUncaughtRejectionsAndShouldBeFixed line, since the type of _linkedToInspector has changed to a boolean: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=_linkedToInspector&redirect=true.

> Is the fx-team version intended for Aurora38 as well?

The additional fx-team patch (attachment 8575452) is essentially a "code cleanliness" change: it removes a promise rejection whitelist statement from a test which no longer whitelists anyway (since the error message content changed due to the other patches in this bug).  It should have no impact on test outcome, it just removes dead code.

It should be fine to also land on Aurora, but I don't see a strong need to put it there either, unless someone feels it's simpler to follow that way.
Landed test cleanup change for fx-team:
