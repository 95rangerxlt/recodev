Update pdf.js to version 0.8.160

Dave,
In this update we've added support for ranged loading so we can start rendering the PDF before we download the whole thing.  Could you review the applicable chrome privileged code (mainly components/PdfStreamConverter.js and content/network.js).
Might as well pick up a few more updates while we wait.

#3203 Fix for issue #2881
#3259 Fixes a broken pdf link for kdchart.pdf
#3245 Localized "invalid_password" to PL
#3241 Dutch localization (nl_NL) update

I'd rather remove the closures unless there is a reason I'm missing that makes them necessary.

Why not just originalRequest.URI.spec?

Why the closure here?
Well, that was dumb. Forgot I had this in my queue when I pushed another patch to m-c. Mossop said over IRC it's ok to push a follow-up to address his comments rather than backing out.

They're not really needed here, but this is a standard way we do our "class like" objects in pdf.js.  We can remove them from this file though since it doesn't fit in with the rest of the file.

Will fix.

Will fix.

This file is shared with our regular library so I'd like to keep it in the same style as the rest of pdf.js.
