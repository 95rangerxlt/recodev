I frequently run two Nightlies:

1. An official Nightly build I use for regular browsing
2. A locally built Nightly to test whatever feature I am building

These currently use the same application icon, and I waste a sad amount of time each day switching to the wrong application and getting confused when both are open.

It would be nice if we could alter the icon of locally built Nightlies in some way.  For the browser toolbox, we added a small "play / pause" annotation to that process in bug 1091260, which is quite helpful for that case.  We could do the same here, but this type of change is Mac only.  At least it gets you something quick without requiring asset changes.

Mike, is there a good configure flag or similar to distinguish "locally built Nightly" from "official Nightly built by Mozilla"?

My instinct is to use MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL == "default", but I feel like I've seen you say that's bad in the past.
Local builds are already *not* using the same logo:

This is what you should get for nightlies:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/nightly/mozicon128.png

This is what you should get for local builds:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/unofficial/mozicon128.png

Sure, the difference is subtle, but there already is one. So you /could/ make a case to change the unofficial branding images, but there's nothing to do on the build system's end.
Stephen, can we get more differentiation between these two icons (see comment #2), please? :-)

Oh wow, that's an impressively subtle distinction!  Well, thanks for the info.  Hopefully UX can make it the distinction more obvious for us.

Actually, on my local Mac builds at least, it does not seems like browser/branding/unofficial is actually used.  I really do get the nightly branding.  MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY remains set to nightly from browser/confvars.sh[1] when I check the variables in config.status for local builds.

I noticed that b2g does use unofficial in confvars.sh.  Mike, does this mean browser/confvars.sh is not set up correctly here?

I don't have the time to look into this at the moment. If some other visually inclined designer does I can help point to the right files to update.
As I'm not mobile-focused, I'd defer to Mike and Bryan!

It would seem so.

This shouldn't be needed, because confvars.sh is a dependency of config.status. IOW, any change to confvars.sh should retrigger configure, and that should be enough.

This should also be added to at least the debug mozconfigs. I guess it's fine not to add it to asan builds.

Please request the next review from :glandium.

This does make me wonder why we don't have a shared "nightly" mozconfig, because updating something like 12 files seems excessive.

While updating the comment, I noticed bug 659568, which essentially wants to make the same change.  But it seems like it got blocked on a bunch of name discussions.

The unofficial directory seems to use "Mozilla Developer Preview" as the brand*Name today.  Hopefully that's fine?

Maybe we can keep the name the same as whatever it is now and update just the icon for the time being? We can file a followup bug to bikeshed about name changes (which might also be useful to distinguish the two!).

Sure, I'd be fine with that.  For now, I'll wait to hear Gavin's decision on whether this is a good idea or not.
Gijs, is there anyone else who can make the official decision on whether this is okay or not?  Gavin hasn't replied.
I'm sorry this lingered.

As we're changing this code to do what it was intended to do from the beginning (use unofficial instead of nightly branding), I don't think you need anything more than an r+ from a peer. I am happy to give you an rs=me seeing as you already have a build peer review the requisite actual build shenanigans. If I am not official enough, maybe ask 1 other person, say, ttaubert, and then declare quorum and ask for forgiveness later if people show up being surprised/upset by the change? :-)
rs=me as well.

Gijs, this additional patch implements my understanding of what you mentioned in comment 17: unofficial now uses the same strings as Nightly, so only the graphics are different.
