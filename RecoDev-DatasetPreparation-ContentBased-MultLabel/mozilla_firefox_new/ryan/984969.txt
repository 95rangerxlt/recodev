The Browser Toolbox's main script file opens a connection at the top-level of the file[1].

This is okay currently, but in bug 797639, the transport will be refactored to use async streams, so this immediate connection dispatch stream events to the event queue.

The startup precompilation tool runs all these JS files, so this means it triggers the immediate connection here.  Once these future transport changes land, this tool ends up with event queue that causes it to segfault.

The easy fix is to just wait for load here, so the tool doesn't attempt network activity.

I'm secretly wishing this also fixes bug 945663.

That would be nice!  I can't reproduce that one, so maybe someone else will be able to tell if it's fixed...
