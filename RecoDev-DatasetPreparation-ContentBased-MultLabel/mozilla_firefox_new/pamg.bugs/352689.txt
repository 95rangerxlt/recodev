When you visit a page that advertises its search plug-ins so that Fx's autodiscovery finds them, the search bar doesn't announce that by a color change like usual anymore. Just a mac problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://www.searchplugins.net/pluginlist.aspx
2. Search bar doesn't show that the autodiscovery found search engines


Actual Results:  
Search bar looks like it looks for pages where the autodiscovery doesn't find search plug-ins offered.

Expected Results:  
Color change around the symbol of the current search plug-in announces that autodetection found search plug-ins for installation

Gavin says that he heard Pam say this was caused by missing a file in a check-in. Confirming for now...
Regression from 351618. CSS, not a missing file, but I'm working on it.

Fixes pinstripe breakage

Updates pinstripe to use stacked images instead of button background-images for hover, open, and engine-is-available states too.
Fixed on branch.

Short question: is the triangle supposed to be centered on the blue spot? If so the blue spot is not placed correctly in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060915 BonEcho/2.0 ID:2006091508

Screenshot of blue splotch

attaching this screenshot, i agree that the current implementation looks odd to me on Mac.

Glow screenshot

Odd -- here's what I see in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/2006091508 BonEcho/2.0.  It looks pretty centered to me.
I also see the version on Marcia's screenshot.

broken glow (using 20060915)

That's strange, 'cause mine looks totally different.
change the width of the window, the distance of the triangle to the search engine icon seems to get wider the wider the window, while the spot stays at the same place.

centered glow after resizing window

The width of the searchbar seems to affect the appearance of the splotch. That can't be right.

What it's affecting is the distance between the search-engine icon and the left end of the searchbar.  The splotch is actually part of the same image that the left end is, so it can't be moving -- but the triangle is.

For reference, a 1068-pixel-wide window has an off-center splotch (the icon and triangle are too far right), 1069 pixels also off-center, 1070 through 1072 centered, and 1073 off-center again.
nominating to get back on the radar.

Set left margin rather than centering

Okay, apparently the code that centers even-pixel-width XUL objects in an odd-pixel-width box isn't consistent about whether it takes the floor or ceiling for the left margin, and the choice depends on the location of the outer box.

So here's a patch that removes the pack="center", sets a hard left margin instead in winstripe, and spaces the triangle out from the favicon properly in pinstripe.  I've tested in Mac, Windows, ad Linux, and it looks correct in all the window sizes I've tried.

r+a=me, this needs to go in by 6 PM PDT today, if I don't hear from you by then I'll land it for you :)
I landed this on the branch:
mozilla/browser/components/search/content/search.xm 1.37.2.62
mozilla/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/searchbar.css 1.3.8.24
mozilla/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser/searchbar.css 1.4.8.15
All of the patches here seem to be in on the trunk (the last one due to bug 353673), so I'm guessing that this can be marked FIXED now. Can a mac trunk user confirm?
Splotch and arrow look exactly alike at 1068 and 1071 pixels in a trunk build from last night.
