The fragment hyperlinks in the new about:licen[cs]e don't work. According to Neil, it's because the about: protocol doesn't implement fragment indentifiers.

Therefore, I am going to write a JS solution.

A JS solution would suck for various reasons. And it turns out that you can make fragment identifiers work, as long as you precede them with a full URL. So, patch on the way.

This one doesn't get corrected, I guess it's missing a class="correctme" on the <p> tag. r=me with that (well those, if toolkit has the same bug) fixed.
Checked into trunk. I'll verify it then get branch approval.

Note: unlike stable branch or frozen trunk approval you have to specify the victim - 1.8.1 branch is another module owner chore.
Checked in on branch.
