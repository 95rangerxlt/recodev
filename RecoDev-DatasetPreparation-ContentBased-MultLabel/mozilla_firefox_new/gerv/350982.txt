about:license doesn't indicate (almost) all the source is under tri-license, and doesn't talk about sqlite.
From the current branch nightlies:

Most is available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL). A subset of that body of code is additionally available under the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License.

And under the "Initial Developers" section:

[...], The sqlite Project, [...]

---------------------------------------------

What's rather outdated is the list of "Initial Developers" itself (which is missing some names)...

This is wrong, now that everything except external libraries and few exceptions is indeed tri-licensed. The text as it is here says the code is MPL, and on some places GPL and LGPL, while it *is* MPL, GPL and LGPL.
 
> And under the "Initial Developers" section:

But the sqlite license text is not present.

as well as about:credits.
Names are added to about:credits by request, see the bottom of the page (http://www.mozilla.org/credits/).
Gerv: Which of these issues can/must be resolved for Firefox 2?
The list of Initial Developers probably needs regenerating. I have a script for that.

We could update the about:licence text too. I've been meaning to do that.

The sqlite licence is not listed because it does not require or even request listing.

Gerv, please get a patch together ASAP so this can make RC1.

Patch v.1

Here's a patch. 

It updates the initial text to be more clear, and uses a updated list of Initial Developers created by running the tools in mozilla/tools/relic over the entire Mozilla source tree. (Better to be safe than sorry.)

I've switched the names to one per line, so in future it will be more obvious from the diffs which names have been added or removed. However, it means such a check is not easy this time.

I'm totally the wrong person to be asking for a review on this patch; punting over to cbeard ...

Patch v.1

ok, there are some edits required here to meet legal and product requirements

the second text block should read as follows:
---
Except as described <a href=”about:license#exceptions”>here</a>, all of the source code to the software included in this product is available under open source licenses. The core portion of the software is available under any one of the following: the Mozilla Public License (MPL), the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). That is, you may copy and distribute such software according to the terms of any one of the following licenses.
---

following the list of links to the tri-licenses, the next paragraph should be replaced with:
---
The remainder of the software, which is not under the MPL/LGPL/GPL tri-license, is available under one of a variety of more permissive licenses. Those that require reproduction of the license text in the distribution are given below. (Note: your copy of this product may contain code covered by one or more of the licenses listed here, depending on the exact product and version you choose).
---

and, finally, the "exceptions" footnote should read as follows:
---
* Exceptions

Your product distribution and version may include the following portions not available under the terms of open source licenses:

     * The Talkback crash-reporting module (Copyright ©1998-2005 SupportSoft, Inc. All Rights Reserved.)
     * Some image files containing the trademarks and logos of the Mozilla Foundation or Mozilla Corporation may not be reproduced without permission. (Copyright ©2004-2006 The Mozilla Foundation. All Rights Reserved.)
---
my understanding is that the list of "initial developers" is part of a license disclosure and is not intended to be equivalent to the list of credits in the about box, on the web site, etc. (which should all be aligned, ideally)
Gerv, do you have an update?
mconnor: working on it. It has required a quick email exchange with cbeard.

Gerv
Gerv, time's running short, we wanted to start RC1 builds in 3.5 hours...
Working on it right now.

Here's a patch with cbeard's changes (or a tweaked version of them, based on our email discussion) merged in. He may have further feedback, I don't know; but this will certainly do to be going on with.

Patch checked in to trunk and branch on behalf of author.
the patch has:
+Netscape Commmunications Corp,

mmmm must be wrong
<b>Henrik</b>: You're right; that's a small glitch. My script for extracting the original authors makes an attempt to merge variations of the same name, but it missed this  one because someone thinks there are three "m"s in "Communications". I'll find the file in question and fix it on the trunk. If there's another patch to the about:licence file before release, I'll fix this too.
