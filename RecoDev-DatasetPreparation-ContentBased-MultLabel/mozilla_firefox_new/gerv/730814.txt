We should remove the MPL 1.1, LGPL and GPL license texts, and replace them with the MPL 2 text (plus perhaps a note about LGPL and GPL compatibility, modelled on the one written for NSS in bug 716563). 

We can do this before switching all the code headers (bug 716478) - there's no legal problem with that, as MPL 1.1 allows distribution under later versions.

Luis: can you sanity-check comment 0 before I go ahead with this?

Thanks :-)

Gerv
That sounds correct to me. I would hope that the compatibility language is unnecessary or could perhaps be addressed in the FAQ?
Yep, OK, we can link to the FAQ.

Created attachment 601235
Patch v.1

This switches to MPL 2, adding a link to the FAQ, corrects a few inaccuracies about what license applies to what, and also makes the document validate as HTML5.

The pedant in me says that all the name -> id changes should be in a different commit, but otherwise this looks fine to me.

I am afraid that I am unable to figure out how to formally r+ this in the UI, but as plain-old-text, here is an r+.

The link to the MPL section doesn't work because about:license#mpl doesn't exist as a named anchor.
djcater: thanks; fixed.

    1.48 +        <li><span class="path">msvc*.dll</span> (C and C++ runtime libraries)</li>

Why did that need to be added?

Shouldn't the Microsoft changes be reviewed and checked in separately (in a different bug)? You've changed the name of the licence, the layout of it, and the files it covers all under the commit comment of "Add "mpl" anchor.".
Oops. That is a patch for a different bug. I'll work on a backout.

Gerv
There we go:

That's better. Thanks!
