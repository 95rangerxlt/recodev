Keyboard navigation (tabbing) doesn't work for buttons and checkboxes and pop-up
menus with the default theme (Pinstripe) dialogs.  For example, dialogs like
allow cookie, save bookmark, preferences, etc.  I have "Full keyboard access"
enabled in my System Preferences, so this should work.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Try to nagigate dialogs with keyboard.

Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
keyboard navigation should work

sounds like bug 223328 --I don't think tabbing navigation works (by default) in
any theme on Mac firefox (afaik).

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 223328 ***
No, this is not a duplicate of bug 223328.  That bug is about keyboard
navigation of HTML elements in web page content.  My bug is clearly about
keyboard navigation of dialogs and menus.
Confirming: Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

I believe this should block for 1.0mac.


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 187508 ***
now that a patch for bug 187508 has been checked into the trunk, this remains an
issue in today's (2005010710-trunk) Firefox build. so, reopening (this seems to
be one of the earlier bugs dup'd against bug 187508) and nominating.

notes:

a. the Full Keyboard Navigation system pref *is* respected by Firefox but *only*
for web page content.

b. this is *not* a problem for Mozilla (seamonkey) on Mac OS X: somehow
tabbing/keyboard navigation through the chrome works fine there. (tested with
2005010706-trunk).

(once Camino trunk comes out, I'll add a comparison note here, but iirc this
wasn't an issue there.)
it's funky that this doesn't seem to be a problem with other themes, eg, I was
able to tab/arrow through UI elements when using Panthere's Firecat theme.

Kevin, any idea why this might be happening with Pinstripe? feel free to reassign!

I'll test a couple more themes (although watch out for bug 273423; workaround:
install theme in ffox 1.0, then launch w/trunk build.)
something I noticed while using Phoenity 1.4.1 and Lila 1.7: the focus ring
doesn't always appear over dialog buttons (eg, Preferences or Themes dialog).

it seems to be specific to how the theme is implemented: in Lila, the focus ring
never seemed appear for a button. in Phoenity, the focus ring doesn't appear in
the Theme dialog buttons, but does appear in Preference buttons as a barely
perceptible dotted rectangle on the inside of the button (different from the
Aqua-style bluish glow for checkboxes, radiobuttons and menulists).

in addition, focus for listboxes (eg, Cookies, Plugin/Helper Apps) and twisties
(eg, Advanced pref panel, Bookmarks) also seems invisible.

however, in both themes you can certainly tab to the widgets and activate them
(spacebar for buttons, arrows elsewhere); focus is just not always visible.
sairuh, on those themes that tabbing to buttons does work, does "Full keyboard
access' taked in cout? (i.e. non-teextbox-elements are not in the tab-order when
it's turned off)

I'm pretty sure bug 187508 didn't affect XUL, aaronlev mentioned that a year or
two ago ;)
Yeah, for some reason Pinstripe has -moz-user-focus: ignore; CSS rules in place
for some widgets. See also bug 198097. I'll try to come up with something that
indicates focus until we get consistent focus rings from the natively drawn widgets.
Answering myself: no.

I have opened bug 277516 for the backend part of this one.
i get pinstripe to follow full keyboard access preference (see backend patch on
bug 277516).

the change in pinstripe is basicly:
- -moz-user-focus: ignore;
+ -moz-user-focus: follow_forms_tab_focus;

one ugly mac-widget bug here: there is no focus ring for buttons and textboxes
(it does exist for select box, radio, checkbox, etc.)
Please split push buttons to a separate bug, i won't fix it here.
Mano, I'm going to fix the -moz-user-focus issue today or tomorrow in the next
round of Pinstripe updates. If this is all you were going to do, please reassign
to me.
You shoundn't do it before bug 277516 is fixed (the fix here should be just to
remove -moz-user-focus, yeah), but as we're not going to release anything soon,
this is your decision ;)

Anyway, please keep -moz-user-focus for buttons until we hack them to have focus
rings (not like textbox focus rings, this isn't a theme issue).

> Please split push buttons to a separate bug, i won't fix it here.

there bug 203734 which covers xul buttons in the pinstripe theme for mozilla.
it's under Core, perhaps it could be applicable here? (for xul-based Mac apps)
(In reply to comment #15)

That's the one, i have already done some work on it, but so far it has some
issues :(
backend part is fixed (bug 277516), just need to remove -moz-user-fcous from
radio, checkbox, menulist, etc.
removed focus ignore on menulists, checkboxes, and radios on the trunk. fixed?
we still need to fix:
 1. buttons (you'll do the focus rings..)
 2. tabbrowser tabs (bug 280590, waiting for you look kevin)
bug 203734 will enable focus rings for push buttons on 10.4 and above.
Created attachment 185186
allow tabbing to buttons
Comment on attachment 185186
allow tabbing to buttons

so, this does have focus rings with < 10.4 right? :)

Assuming so, r=me.
No, but there's not much we can do at this point. We don't have a way to use
native focus rings on one system version, and some sort of eye-candy style rules
on another.
tested with 2005060807-trunk deer park bits on OS X 10.4.1:

a. when I have a full keyboard access turned on in system prefs, I can tab to
all html form widgets (expected).

b. when I have "text controls only" selected for keyboard system prefs, tabbing
only goes to textareas/fields in html form and chrome widget (expected).

c. I tried tabbing within chrome widgets in the Preferences windows (with full
keybd access ON), and I saw a couple oddities:

1. the focus ring goes to buttons, but it looks like an incomplete blue ring.
2. focus moves to the toolbar, but no focus ring is visible/
3. in categories with subpanels --namely the subpanels under Privacy and
Advanced-- tabbing navigation doesn't move focus to those sub-tabs.

let me know if bugs already exist for the above, or if I should spin off new ones.

We have some bugs on those focus ring issues.

> 2. focus moves to the toolbar, but no focus ring is visible

Could you please file a bug on it and cc me and kmgeirch? I /think/ it's not mac
specific.

> 3. in categories with subpanels --namely the subpanels under Privacy and

That's (more or less) bug 231313 (Jaguar-style tabs are not focusable). Note
that Ctrl+Tab does work.

Pinstripe should follow "Full keyboard access" system preferences
