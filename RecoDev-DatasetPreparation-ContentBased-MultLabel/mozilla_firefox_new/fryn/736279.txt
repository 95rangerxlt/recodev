There are three issues with about:home that we should fix immediately:
1. Launcher buttons do not crop properly when the restore session button is not present. (CSS flexbox weirdness)
2. The restore session button doesn't disappear after the session has been restored. (Typo!)
3. The about:home onload handler in browser.js throws when the document is being unloaded as it gets executed. This was an issue before the new about:home stuff landed, but it's a one-line fix, so I'll do it here.

Also added "Marketplace" to aboutHome.dtd to avoid fuss later.

Third time's the charm (I hope)!

I have verified point 2 from comment 0. The Restore Session button disappeared after restoring the session.

Frank, can you please tell me:
 what I should/shouldn't see when verifying point 1?
 how can I verify point 3?
(In reply to Ioana Budnar [QA] from comment #5)

This doesn't need further verification.
Feel free to move onto other bugs.
Thanks.
