The location bar accepts both urls and non-urls. It's unnecessary to distinguish the clipboard is an url or not for "Paste & Go" menuitem, just behave like pressing Enter key in the location bar. If ctrl- or middle-clicked, behave like pressing Alt+Enter key.

Reproducible: Always

Also, if you have a url in the clipboard without the leading "http://" (e.g. "www.example.com"), Paste & Go is not shown.
I miss being able to "paste & go" keyword searches like "bug 611590" where "bug" was the keyword for "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch="

patch

reverts bug 601695 patch to simpler, more predictable, and arguably more useful behavior.
Also paste and search should be an option if clipboard contains multiple words.
(In reply to comment #4)
By default, entering words into the location bar performs a search, so that is exactly what selecting "Paste & Go" will do.

Don't distinguish an url or not for "Paste & Go"



Bug 611590 - Make "Paste & Go" consistent with "Paste" regardless of clipboard contents. r=gavin ui-r=faaborg a=betaN+gavin
