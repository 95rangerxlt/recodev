Bug 790934 added a spec violation that's web-observable.  Specifically, it's changing the DOM for about:blank documents, which is web-visible and changing it is a spec violation.

We should just exclude about:blank (mea culpa: bug 790934 comment 15).
I was not aware of this about:blank specification, my assumption to exclude about:blank was for optimization reasons.
Many thanks for pointing it out.
I will add the interdiff to exclude about:blank here, hopefully by end of today.

(Sorry for the collision, Marco. I wrote this before you assigned it to yourself.)

We need to exclude everything of the pattern:

/^about:blank($|[#?])/i

If we want to avoid using a RegExp, we can just approximate it with the following, which is what this patch does:

doc.documentURI.startsWith("about:") &&
!doc.documentURI.toLowerCase().startsWith("about:blank")
/^about:(?!blank$)/i should be enough as a regex.. though it's probably more readable a simple doc.documentURI.toLowerCase() != "about:blank"

Given that it's quite unlikely for about:blankFOO to exist, and if it did we wouldn't care about not adding the listeners to it, this seems fine.
Thank you for the quick review, Gavin. :)

Probably worth backporting to aurora too...

> /^about:(?!blank$)/i should be enough as a regex..

No, that's not enough, because any web page can open URIs like about:BLAnk?hi that are still interpreted to be the same document as about:blank, and we should not, from our TabsProgressListener, modify the DOM of any document that web pages can create and read.

Firefox UI sets random attributes on root nodes, leads to spec violations
