The google interface at about:home in our nightlies appears to create a full window size component alpha layer. From the looks of the page that seems needlessly complicated. It's possible we're doing something suboptimal.

The google interface at about:home in our nightlies appears to create a full window size component alpha layer. From the looks of the page that seems needlessly complicated. It's possible we're doing something suboptimal.
It's the fixed background:

html {
  background-color: hsl(0,0%,90%);
  background-image: url(chrome://browser/content/abouthome/noise.png),
                    -moz-linear-gradient(hsla(0,0%,100%,.7), hsla(0,0%,100%,.4));
}

I can't actually tell what the background images are doing ... the background looks like a solid color to me.
oh, there's a "background-attachment: fixed;" rule in aboutHome.css that I accidentally trimmed.

I'm pretty sure we don't need that rule, at least.

It's not a solid color. It's a noise texture, but yes it is subtle and intentionally so.
See the following sites for other examples of this type of noise texture in their backgrounds:

No, we don't. Does removing that rule fix this bug?

The background-attachment shouldn't be `fixed` anyway.

Review of attachment 610565:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I thought was part of the design specs, good to know it's not.

Btw, it's still unclear, if this is really a perf problem, of which size? This is becoming more common on the Web (the transparent texture) as pointed out, is there a problem at the platform level or just it's something we should evangelize against?
And finally, if just removing the fixed is enough to solve the perf problem.
The problem is not the texture, it's 'background-attachment:fixed'.

It's not a big problem. Probably no-one would have noticed if Bas hadn't been doing some testing. But making about:home a bit faster to render, with a bit less memory usage, is worth it.

We could fix this case with an optimization in the engine. The reason we use extra resources here is so that we create a separate layer for the fixed background so that scrolling is snappy if you scroll the page. about:home usually doesn't need a scrollbar so we can expect that scrolling won't happen. We could detect that and turn off the separate layer for that case. But we have no data to indicate whether that would be worth doing in general.

Great! I'm glad you and Bas caught this, since background-attachment should have been `scroll` design-wise anyway, but we didn't notice it, since as you noted "about:home usually doesn't need a scrollbar". :)

Thanks, mak, for the review. :)

Should this get ported to aurora?
Might as well, it's minimal risk.

I don't know, but it's not necessary, imho.
