We're very close to a point where we can switch Nightly to per-window private browsing by default.  I'm hoping to do that some time early next week.

We still need a bit more work for that to happen...  I'll do some of that work tonight.  I'll file a separate bug when I'm ready to remove the PB service, but that doesn't necessarily block us to enable this on Nightly.
