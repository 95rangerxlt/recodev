Steps to reproduce:

Expected results:

Should have opened in background per "browser.tabs.loadInBackground" setting but due to Bug 695482 it no longer does.

A new pref in about:config to override the changes in bug 695482 is required.
"is required" is a little strong. "is humbly requested" perhaps? :)

I want to be clear that the reason I'm going to fix this is:
- our previous behavior was long-standing, and some people have gotten used to it
- adding a pref is trivial, and introduces very little maintenance overhead

I don't want this to be perceived as a precedent that implies we'll be adding prefs to every new behavior change, because we aren't going to do that.

Thanks Gavin.  My statement 'is required' was meant to mean a new pref would be needed, rather than hooking the behavior of "browser.tabs.loadInBackground".  

Fully understood about it 'not becoming a norm' for changes.

Pref needed to allow "Search Google for" tabs to open in background
