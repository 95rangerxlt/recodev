Don't attempt to use the addons/integration service in xpcshell

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1140131 +++

In a debug build, attempting to run xpcshell tests with --jsdebugger fails.  Bug 1140131 solved part of the problem and this patch is to solve the rest.

The following attachment avoids using the service in xpcshell by assuming that Services.appinfo.ID being undefined means xpcshell. It solves the recursion problem for me, but the process then crashes - I've no reason to believe the crash is related to this, but I'm not going to find time to dig deeper yet, so I'm just getting this up for comment.

Yeah, I could live with that if it doesn't break anything (add-on debugging in particular).

Rebased patch.

Thanks Mark for the patch, we should proceed with it!
I hit this assertion while working on bug 1113865.
I don't get why this assertion isn't hit today,
but this patch looks good.

Try run:
  https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=6484dad5727f
This exception happens as we are running onNewScript hook for addonManager.js.
It makes perfect sense to hit this exception, I just don't get why we haven't hit that before!
