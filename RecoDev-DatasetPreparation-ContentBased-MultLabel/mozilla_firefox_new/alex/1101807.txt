comparision for low-dpi screens.png

I'd really like to see those changes in Firefox, so I started to work on this.

While working on it I got some questions:

1) Should those changes apply for Â´min-resolution: 2dppxÂ´ only?
I first thought that way, but then I tested my updated design on a low-dpi display. It looked much more like the real Yosemite drop shadow. I compared it with the search box in the Finder (see Â´comparision for low-dpi screens.pngÂ´). Updating the existing styles is easier than creating new ones so I want to be sure about that first ;).

2) Are more detailed specs with colors (+alpha) and the use of shadows vs. borders available?
I was able to create exactly the same drop shadow for the input fields as shown in the spec image by changing the shadows height from 1px to .5px. Also the thinner and darker border at the top of the #nav-bar was no problem. But other changes (=> round back button) seem to be a way more complicated.

3) Can someone provide the new tab top stroke graphics?

4) Should all changes apply for lightweight themes as well?

As soon as question 1) is answered, I'll upload a patch with my current state.
Oh, I've realized that questions 2 (=> bug 1101805) and 3 (=> bug 1101811) are not in the scope of this bug and should be answered there.

This patch updates the drop shadow.
It applies for all resolutions and both theme types.

rs=me assuming this gets us closer to native look even for low-DPI. Thanks!
This is CSS-only so it doesn't need a trypush.

You already have r+ but to make this explicit: I think the current patch is the right solution, yes.

This is bug 1101805, but it would probably be useful if someone did provide more details there.

> 3) Can someone provide the new tab top stroke graphics?

This is bug 1101811, and it's missing images. Michael will hopefully reply there. If you've not heard by the end of the week, please feel free to ping me.

> 4) Should all changes apply for lightweight themes as well?

Certainly this change should, as it does with your patch.

Clearing needinfo here, because I don't think there's anything left.
