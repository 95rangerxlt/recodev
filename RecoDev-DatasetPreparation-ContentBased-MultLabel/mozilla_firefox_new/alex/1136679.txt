Today, if some local command, like adb kill-server, are shutting down adbhelper adb server, it ends up being broken. You then have to restart firefox or disable/enable the addon.
We should try to connect to the local adb server being run or restart a new server.

I've been lazy and opened only one pull request,

See PR.  I like the idea, but it doesn't entirely work on Mac because of device replug requirement.

I tried to also improve mac support when we restart adb server,
but nothing seems to fix the odd failure.
I tried by restarting the server multiple times or when a device is reported as being "offline".

So I just did what you suggested, by reporting all devices as disconnected.
