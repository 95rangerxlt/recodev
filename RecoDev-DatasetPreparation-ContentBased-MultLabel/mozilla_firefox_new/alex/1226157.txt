We get the following exception:
onPacket threw an exception: Error: Server did not specify an actor, dropping packet: {"error":"unknownError","message":"error occurred while processing 'listWorkers: TypeError: Ci.nsIWorkerDebugger is undefined\nStack: BTA_onListWorkers@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://devtools/server/actors/webbrowser.js:1100

For some reason, Ci.nsIWorkerDebugger is undefined on b2g...
Then Debugger panel is completely broken, which is sad. But what is even more sad is that the inspector is also broken and what is even worse is that you can't restore to a working state unless you reopen webide :/

Oh. One mitigation point, you have to set devtools.debugger.workers to true via about:config or toolbox options to get this exception.

The issue at the end is quite simple,
we miss the related xpt file on b2g to have these interfaces defined.
Yi-Fan, could you confirm that you have the workers debugging enabled?
If not... there is something else broken that we should figure out.

Bug 1226157 - Ship nsIWorkerDebugger* idl on b2g. r=fabrice
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/437a1938d6be


Opening the debugger breaks on listWorker request and ends up breaking the debugger and the inspector
