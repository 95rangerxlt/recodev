Broken down from bug 1062345.

Gavin said to use UITour.jsm for this like bug 998934 did for Firefox accounts, which seems weird to me, but OK. :-)

I had suggested we put this in the Firefox self-repair functionality being worked on (which will also be able to be triggered by content AFAICT). If that's not ready then I guess it's okay for UITour for now.

I'm not aware of any code having been written yet, let alone it being near ready.
