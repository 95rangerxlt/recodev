Gaia doesn't launch on b2g desktop for mac and windows due to a regression introduced in bug 905881. We should move the #ifdef B2G first here:

Actually, I think we need to make it even clearer what depends on the application and what depends on the platform.

So we could have:

#ifdef MOZ_B2G       // All b2g builds

#ifdef MOZ_WIDGET_GONK
#endif

#elifdef MOZ_FENNEC  // All fennec
#elifdef MOZ_PHOENIX // Firefox 

#ifdef XP_WIN
#elifdef XP_UNIX
#elifdef XP_MACOSX
#endif


#elifdef MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME // You guessed it...
#else    // Anything unsupported, like Metro
ASSERT('!BOOM!')
#endif

I think we should just have a definition for each platform, like:
#ifdef MOZ_B2G

#elifdef MOZ_FENNEC

#elifdef XP_WIN

#elifdef XP_MACOSX

#elifdef XP_UNIX

#endif

After bug 910473 we'll have the B2G and Fennec part in their own directory.

We shouldn't have a different code path for the Webapp Runtime and Firefox.
B2G is not a platform, it's a product, that runs on different platforms. Same for firefox desktop and the webapprt.

B2G has always the same installation path on every platform, so there's no need to have
#ifdef MOZ_WIDGET_GONK
#endif

Firefox desktop and the Webapp Runtime also have the same installation directory, there's no need to have different code paths for them.

You're missing the point here. I want the top level #ifdef to be products, not platforms. If a product behaves the same on all platforms, fine, no other nested #ifdefs. But keeping #ifdef MOZ_B2G at the same level as #ifdef XP_WIN is just wrong.

Oh, ok. I agree.

Another ifdef layout

It could have been simplier as webapps runtime and firefox are the same today, but #if defined(xxx) || defined(yyy) doesn't seem to work in js files.
I'd prefer the other ifdef layout with an explanatory comment:
#ifdef MOZ_B2G

#elifdef MOZ_FENNEC

// Firefox and Webapp Runtime share the same installation path format
#elifdef XP_WIN

#elifdef XP_MACOSX

#elifdef XP_UNIX
It's up to Fabrice to decide the ifdef layout, but anyway the patch won't work on Mac.
On Mac both XP_MACOSX and XP_UNIX are defined, so you should put XP_MACOSX before XP_UNIX.

Let's do that for now, and clean this up in Bug 910473
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/b2g-inbound/rev/9fc5d65192ae
Could/should we have tests that would catch this in the future? This seems like a pretty bad regression to not catch on TBPL when bug 905881 landed.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/9fc5d65192ae
I think the issue is that this didn't manifest on Linux, which is why TBPL didn't catch it. Is it possible to have a version of the gaia-ui-tests job on TBPL run on OS X?

This is also why I didn't catch the problem in my local testing. I tested the patch in Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, B2G on Linux, but I didn't test in B2G on other platforms.

I'm really sorry for this!

Seems like this patch broke the homescreen for me on the device. I can see this error with logcat:

E/GeckoConsole(  689): [JavaScript Error: "[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIXULAppInfo.ID]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/WebappOSUtils.jsm :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 83"  data: no]" {file: "resource://gre/modules/WebappOSUtils.jsm" line: 83}]

I wonder if this is related to the fact that the homescreen is runned into a child process.

This patch actually work.

Verified by running gaia on device,
and running dom/apps,toolkit/devtools/apps tests on firefox.

I haven't been able to run webappsrt tests,
and I don't have a b2g desktop build ready.
MOZ_PHOENIX is defined for the Webapp Runtime, so the |#elifdef MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME| isn't needed.
MOZ_PHOENIX is also defined for Metro, so we wouldn't throw on Metro.

Perfect is the enemy of good.

About this, you could do:
#elifdef MOZ_METRO
...
#elifdef MOZ_PHOENIX
...
#endif

I agree the other problem is a nit that you could avoid fixing.
I tested on device, desktop-linux and deskop-mac with Alex's patch. They all ran fine. We need to unblock b2g so I'm just gonna land that.

This is exactly like ochameau's patch, the only difference is #ifdef MOZ_METRO to exclude Metro.

Could someone test this on device? Testing the patch on b2g desktop and on the try server isn't enough, I didn't know that and I'm really sorry for the breakage.
