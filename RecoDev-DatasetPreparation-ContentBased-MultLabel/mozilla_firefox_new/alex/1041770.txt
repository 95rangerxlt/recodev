This was oversight from the landing of Bug 952201.  It manifested as:

E GeckoConsole(5812)          [JavaScript Error: "win is undefined" {file: "chrome://browser/content/browser.js" line: 5978}]

when trying to install a blocked add-on.

I talked to Nick on IRC about the fact that this would have to change if Firefox for Android ever becomes multiprocess (in which case the originator would be whatever we target IPC messages to for frame message managers, that would be the <browser remote=true> in Desktop Firefox), but apparently we have no plans to make such a change.
Oh, and thanks for cleaning up my mess here!

Could this fix be backported to 33?

I've just spent hours on trying to install a Firefox addon on my Android phone, without luck... I've tried visiting the xpi URL, using InstallTrigger, uploading the xpi to my sdcard, putting the xpi in the extensions/ directory, and none of the methods worked.

How can I install a Firefox addon in Firefox Beta (33) while this bug is not fixed?

Yeah, that's reasonable.  Requesting uplift.
