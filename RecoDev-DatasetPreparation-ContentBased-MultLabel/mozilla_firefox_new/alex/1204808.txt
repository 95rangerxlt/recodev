Since DevTools will soon have its own /devtools directory, it makes sense to pull the prefs out of browser and toolkit and into our own files.

Rebased, that's the kind of patch to land quickly as it will bitrot
anytime someone tweaks any devtools pref!

The last try looks promising.

Who else do you think I should flag for review regarding browser / moz.build changes?

I suppose you could ask :glandium for review, but the changes mostly seem "obvious" to me...  Maybe we don't need additional review?

Since our prefs file gets packaged in directory with other prefs files, it seems like `devtools.js` would be a much better name.

Also, other pref files in here use the format:

  @RESPATH@/browser/@PREF_DIR@/<FILE>

Assuming you rename it to something DevTools specific, maybe we should move the file under a prefs directory?  That way a file like `devtools.js` is not misinterpreted to be some main JS module.

Renamed to devtools and use @PREF_DIR@.

Seems like you forgot to add the moz.build file in preferences to your patch.
