Due to bug 1046394, we shipped a lot of devices with a broken profiler support.
Instead of displaying a broken profiler, it may be better to just hide it from the toolbox when we detect that the phone doesn't expose any valid profiler actor.

Add a comment here describing why the need for `|| target.form.profilerActor`.

I used a Flame device with 2.1 and Nightly 2014-08-11 to reproduce the issue. I don't see the Profiler tab if I use Developer tools -> Connect or WebIDE to connect to it.
Are there other steps to reproduce? Thank you
Is this the only missing tool? This is really weird. We used to display profiler for multiple releases until this changeset!

Sorry, I believe I didn't get this right. 
I retested today, please see my steps below and let me know where/what to correct.

1. Using a Flame device with OS version 2.1.0.0-prerelease and buildID 20141112001201 connected to WebIDE by a Nightly 34.0a1 2014-08-11, I opened the Clock app and went to Performance tab
2. I started to record and tried to stop the profiling
The tab remains in "Loading.." and it is difficult to see the content of the other tabs

I have the same results with the same device, but using Firefox 34 beta 11 where it should be fixed. I thought that the Performance tab should not appear at all in this case.

Should I use a different Firefox OS buildID?
You should only test Firefox desktop whose version is same or more recent than Firefox OS device/simulator.
We do not try to support debugging devices more recent than WebIDE.

It means that:
- connecting WebIDE before this patch (>2014-08-13) against devices before bug 1046394 (< v2.1 2014-08-13, v2.0 2014-08-14) should expose a broken profiler (this is what you tested in comment 9)
- connecting WebIDE after this patch against devices before bug 1046394 should result in a hidden profiler. (This is the scenario fixed by this bug) (this should be what you tested in comment 9 with FF 34....)
- connecting WebIDE before this patch against devices after bug 1046394 isn't supported but should result in a working profiler.

But note that in parrelel of these bugs, we faced another regression in profile that broke it.
All builds between bug 879008 (2014-08-06) and bug 1061653 (2014-10-02) are broken (possibly visible and certainly broken).
