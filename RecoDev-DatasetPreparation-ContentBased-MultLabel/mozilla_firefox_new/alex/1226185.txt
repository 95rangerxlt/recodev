about:debugging still has no tests. I tried writing the first, but I got report of at least two leaks. We should fix them in order to have tests!

Fix preferences listener leak in about:debugging.

Services.pref.addObserver was leaking the scope function passed to it.
itself keeping about:debugging alive.

The fix end up complexifying the checkboxes quite a bit
and I think moving them to full react would make it easier at the end.

Ensure to unmount about:debugging components on tab close

componentWillUnmount wasn't called on tab close,
so that AddonManager.removeListener wasn't either.
And the AddonManager end up keeping about:debugging alive via this react object.

Again, being full react would help here, we would only have to unmount the root element.

Thanks for addressing this!

Well, since everybody wants to switch the checkboxes to React, I guess that will happen eventually. My current PrefComponent prototype is 50+ lines of React, but I'd like to make it generic for boolean/string/int prefs to justify such verbosity.

Regardless, I think there is an easier way to fix the issue at hand, and I'd like to keep the `updateCheckbox()` method contained:

You could create a `this._prefListeners` object on `AboutDebugging`, then in the mapped function add `this._prefListeners[pref] = updateCheckbox`, and in `destroy()` iterate over `_prefListeners`?

Thanks a lot for catching that.

That's something I've considered as well. If you feel like this would be a huge win for about:debugging, I'd be OK with going full React.

I just think that for simple things like a few headers, links, buttons or checkboxes, React might be a bit overkill.

An array of `{pref,updateCheckbox}` objects could work too if you prefer.

Changing to r- because of a problem in the code, but please use the `_prefListeners` approach I suggested in comment 3.

That calls won't work because your proposed `this.updateCheckbox` expects 3 parameters.

Nit: Maybe push the listener *after* it was successfully added as pref observer?
