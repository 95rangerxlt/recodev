I don't think it worked with previous versions of Firefox, I tested and the rendering is broken too. In some old versions, the PDF loads endlessly or displays a blank page.
In the current version of Firefox, only the vertical text is displayed, the scanned part is not.

Console log:

The solution was proposed at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/5284 and currently under review


[PDF Viewer] Firefox fails to decode scanned text as image (blank)
