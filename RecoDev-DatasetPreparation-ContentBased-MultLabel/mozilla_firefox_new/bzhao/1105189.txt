If this is something that's going to be needed for Firefox 34, it may require a rebuild. cc'ing lawrence.
I don't think we should block on this, and realistically we're planning on removing distribution/bundles support entirely in the near future.

Hi Benjamin,

The Firefox China repack distributed by Beijing office currently has two extensions in distribution/bundles, one is addon installer which was also used in byob to workaround bug 641746; the other one provides a 360 secure browser bookmark migrator on WINNT, and we want it to be available on profile creation. Any advice on how to accomplish these once distribution/bundles support is removed? Thanks.

I'm going on bsmedberg's advice in comment 4. We're not going to block on this for 34.

Look for the distribution/bundles directory under Contents/Resources due to v2 signing requirements
