If you backout the workaround in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/8428dce9dde0 you will see the following error:

Security Error: Content at resource://gre-resources/hiddenWindow.html may not load or link to chrome://global/content/mozilla.xhtml

The workaround was put in as a temporary measure and should be removed.

Dexter, are you able to fix this test to not cause the error?

HiddenFrame attempt

I was not able to reproduce the problem on OSX 10.8.5 after backing out the change.

This patch changes the test to use HiddenFrame, which does not set the "src" field of the IFRAME to the offending URL. Does this fix the issue?

This is a problem outside of OS X (that was what I meant by "outside OS X" in the summary) since the hidden window on OS X has a chrome URI instead of a resource one.

Can you test on Windows or Linux and flag me for review if it works?

HiddenFrame attempt

Whoops, sorry. I've checked on Windows and this patch fixes the problem there. I'll double check on Linux in the following days.

r=me assuming this test no longer fails on try with the hidden window whitelist removed.

It seems to work as the test, which is in the bc2 suite, is consistently green across all the platforms.

browser_no_tabs.js loads a chrome URL from the hidden window (resource:// outside OS X)



Bug 1145472 - Use HiddenFrame in browser_no_tabs.js test to fix security errors. r=MattN
