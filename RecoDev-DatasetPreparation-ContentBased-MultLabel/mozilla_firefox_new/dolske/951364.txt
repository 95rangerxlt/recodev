Patch v.1

The context menu for buttons on the toolbar offers "Add to Menu", and conversely the context menu for buttons in the menu panel offers "Add to Toolbar". It would be a little clearer if these were instead "Move to Menu" / "Move to Toolbar", since that's what's happening (the location of the button is changing, it's not additive).

The context menu for items in the customization palette should stay the same, I think. (Since the user is "adding" a button to their UI.)

These shouldn't share the same accesskey since they are both visible at the same time when in the context menu of an item in the palette. Please switch the Toolbar context menu item to T (as long as it doesn't conflict in other scenarios).

Nope. Only one of these will be visible at a time (depending on where the button is).

As noted in comment 0, items in the customization palette will still have the existing "Add to Menu" and "Add to Toolbar" items (which are both shown concurrently).
