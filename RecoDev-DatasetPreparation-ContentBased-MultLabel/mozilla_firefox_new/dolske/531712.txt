Current blocklist.xml

Copy of currently-live blocklist.xml (pulled from
https://addons.mozilla.org/blocklist/1/%7Bec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384%7D/3.5/). Looks like we serve the same XML for all Firefox versions, so this should be good as a drop-in replacement for /browser/app/blocklist.xml on all branches.

I see the version for 3.0 is already updated automagically in CVS, so this only needs to land for trunk, 3.6, 3.5.

You used the wrong url, try https://addons.mozilla.org/blocklist/3/%7Bec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384%7D/3.5/Firefox/20090105024647/blocklist-sync/en-US/nightly/blocklist-sync/default/default/

From Mossop's URL, confirmed that the v.3 (/3/ in URL) list is what's used for 1.9.1 - 1.9.3.

(Not needed for 3.0.17, since that's already updated automatically in CVS)
