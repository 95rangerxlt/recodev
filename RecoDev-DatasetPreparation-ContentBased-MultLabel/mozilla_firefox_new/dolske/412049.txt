Patch v.1 for review

XPM is a crufty old format. Bug 410215 describes some problems with it, and landed a change to allow using PNG images instead.

As a first step towards fixing bug 404402, we should replace the existing XPM with a PNG. That bug can then add optimized versions for different sizes as needed.

This patch replaces default.xpm with default16.png. I went ahead and included the change for XUL Runner here too, since it uses the same generic "globe" icon as unbranded Firefox.

Firefox shouldn't use specified PNG, but icon from icon theme.

Patch v.2

Updated with review comments.
What about including Firefox' icon in /usr/share/icons/hicolor and using "firefox" using from icon theme (which always inherits hicolor)?

Even when using PNG as icon, when I press Alt+Tab, I'll see blurry 16x16 PNG resized to higher size, eg 32x32 or 48x48.
Checked in.

This bug is about simply replacing the existing XPM usage with PNG. If you want to change other things regarding the window icon, file a new bug (or find some existing bug covering your concern).

This is because this patch only adds default16.png, I guess bug 404402 is about providing other sizes, such as SeaMonkey has done in bug 411494
