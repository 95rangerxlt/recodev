Screenshot of now left margin on an info panel

Since the spec only had panels with icons and buttons, I forgot to consider when those aren't provided. I've pushed the UITour catalogue to my gh-pages branch so it's easier to manually test other combinations in the future: http://mnoorenberghe.github.io/mozilla-uitour/demos/catalogue.html

Luckily I don't know of any plans to use such an info panel for 29 but we should probably fix this just in case.

I'm not working on this at the moment but I think it would be valuable to fix for future tour info panels.
Hi Matt, just a friendly +1 to get this fixed at some point in the future. 

For the last iterations of various tours the copy/design folks expressed the wish to use info panels without an image, but we had to find something suitable to workaround this layout bug.
This bug will affect our design/copy for the Hello UITour.

I'm not adding as a blocker yet, but I would like to know if this is something we can land in the next week.

Thanks
Removing needinfo from mreavy since this is a non-Hello change. I made it block the meta bug since it's wanted although not a hard blocker it seems.

This isn't a blocker and comment 2 suggests there's already a workaround in place. "Nice to have" but we're not going to worry about it if it introduces complication.

Trivial fix. The negative margin on the icon container was shifting things over, so just hide the container instead of the icon itself.

I'm confused. Did you forget to qrefresh? You defined `tooltipIconContainer` but are referencing `tooltipContainer`?

Yeah, dunno what happened there. Bad cut'n'paste when updating my tree I guess.

[Triage Comment]

Approving for aurora+beta since this is needed for the Hello tour in fx35 and is trivial and low-risk.
