So my Aurora was updated to Developer Edition and the ADB Helper addon was installed.
I later clicked the WebIDE button and got a warning from AVG telling me that adb.exe was a threat and asking if I should let AVG decide what to do about it (it probably would have removed or quarantined it). 

I've installed ADB Helper in the past and I'm not sure if I remember getting warned like this.  I tried to take a screenshot but failed. Point being that it looked threatening enough.

Anyway, this is more likely to lead to issues/frustrations. Is there a way we can prevent this?

What version of ADB Helper do you have (from about:addons)?

I'll attempt to contact AVG.
0.7.1
I have completed AVG's false detection form.  I will update this bug with any updates I receive from them.
AVG claims an exception has been added for the ADB binary.


AVG Antivirus is detecting ADB Helper as a threat
