I recently upgraded ESLint to 1.1.0 and I now see the following 2 linting errors on any devtools files:

Rule 'no-empty-class' was removed and replaced by: no-empty-character-class
Rule 'spaced-line-comment' was removed and replaced by: spaced-comment

We should update browser/devtools/.eslintrc to reflect these changes *and* send an email to everyone asking to upgrade their eslint install!

Or have it auto-update via mach? mach eslint landed a month ago or so, it's worth looking into how that works and see if there's a n update mechanism in place.

Thanks for taking care of this Ryan.
Of course this begs the question: how are we going to deal with the fact that people may have various versions of ESLint installed?
I think the answer could be: first of all, let's document which version we use on https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/CodingStandards
Then, let's try to maybe stick to this version, at least for a while, until we have a compelling reason to move to another one.
Mike's working on something like `./mach eslint-setup` which would install ESLint locally, this would solve this.

mach eslint --setup

I am starting to think it should be part of mach bootstrap though although that would mean implementing the Windows version (mach bootstrap is osx & Linux only).

Okay, for now I've noted "ESLint 1.1.0 or later" on the wiki.  The latest version is 1.5.0, not sure if we want to just say that or not.

Some Node projects install ESLint locally (instead of globally) and invoke via node_modules/.bin/eslint to ensure the expected version is used.  I don't really feel strongly about what approach we take.

I did a try run, though I don't think we test this stuff yet...

That would complicate adding modules... especially when future plugins may have a minimum version. We are best to just recommend the latest version.

We don't test it yet... we need to make our codebase more conformant first.


Some ESLint rules have been removed in v1.1.0
