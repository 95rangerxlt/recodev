There's no way to traverse directly to the parent of the currently selected node using the keys right now.

You can use the up arrow, but if there are a lot of children it would take several presses to get up to the parent.

Windows (and some editors on the Mac too) use left arrow.
Benoit points out the key navigation scheme they use for profiler reports: http://people.mozilla.com/~bgirard/cleopatra/?report=61b0e48c6b1c88b4c1699db40cdad6bf7bd6c3df

It seem like pressing left will close the node, and if it's already closed, will navigate to the parent.

Fixed by patch that was landed in bug 796009.
To give a bit more detail, the left arrow will now collapse an expanded node or move to the parent of a collapsed node.  So, you can now traverse up the hierarchy much faster via left arrow.
