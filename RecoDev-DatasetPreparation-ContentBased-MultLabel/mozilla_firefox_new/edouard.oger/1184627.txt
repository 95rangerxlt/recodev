'warning16.svg' implies that this is for 16x16, but since it's scalable we can drop the '16' suffix.

I don't see `unset` as a valid property value for -moz-image-region. I think you're looking for `auto`, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-image-region

In my local testing I was able to remove the -moz-image-region property here with no negative side effects.

Also, the graphic you're replacing used to be grayscale and had two versions (lighter and darker versions). It looks like only one of them was being used. Can you confirm?

Also, are we sure that we want to switch from grayscale to color?

Not working for me, see attachment.

Yup

Got the ok from rfeeley, we're clear.
