All products use the single unicode character, this should be fixed for consistency. We don't usually change the existing ID in these cases.

As explained in comment 0, it's not really needed for this kind of change (see for example bug 760804).
Asked pike on IRC and got green light on not renaming the string. Reflagging for review.

FYI, you don't need to use [land-in-fx-team] anymore. Just checkin-needed works fine :)
