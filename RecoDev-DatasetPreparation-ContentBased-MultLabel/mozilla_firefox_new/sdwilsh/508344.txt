Since bug 455555 landed, there are now some unused preferences in firefox.js that we should remove.
These are:
browser.urlbar.search.chunkSize
browser.urlbar.search.timeout

We also should remove the timeout attribute since it is apparently controlled by a preference.

yeah, looks like timeout has a minimum of 50ms defined in autocomplete.xml and browser.urlbar.delay too

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
