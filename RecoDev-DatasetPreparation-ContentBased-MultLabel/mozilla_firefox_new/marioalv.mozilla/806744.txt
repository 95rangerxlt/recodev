In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the same directory (perhaps with "_perwindowpb" appended to its file name), and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.  Note that the original test should only be added to the list of test files in Makefile.in ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING, and the new test file should be added to the list with the reverse condition.

Patch to migrate the test to the new per window private mode

Hi.
I changed the logic of the original test so the new logic make sense in the new per-window private browsing mode.

The steps for this test are:
First we test the transition from normal to per-window pb mode, where the form value should exist in the history.
1. Open a form in normal window mode. Fill and submit the form. 
2. Open a form in per-window private browsing mode. The value from step 1 should exist in the form history. Submit the form.
Second, we test the transition from per-window pb mode to normal mode, where the form value should no exist in the history.
3. Clear the form history so we start the test from scratch.
4. Open a form in per-window private browsing mode. Fill and submit the form. 
5. Open a form in normal window mode. The value from step 4 should not exist in the form history because we are coming from per-window private mode. Fill and submit the form. 
6. End test.

Let me know if this way of testing is OK and adapts to the new per-window private browsing mode.

Thanks.

As can this one.

I don't think this particular test adds any value.

I don't think this test is necessary, it just verifies the result from the last one.

Patch to migrate the test to the new per window private mode

Hi.
I made the changes you requested. 
These are now the steps executed by the test:

1. Open a form in per-window private browsing mode. Fill and submit the form. 
2. Open a form in normal window mode. The value from step 1 should not exist in the form history because we are coming from per-window private mode. Fill and submit the form. 
3. End test.

Please let me know if everything's OK with the changes.

Thanks.
Josh, do we need a try run for this?
Yes, it would be good. This may also break mobile.
Pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=3420f6844e81
Try is good!
