Take a file named <☙.css>.

In the Style Editor, it is displayed as <%E2%98%99.js>.
It would be nicer to display it as the corresponding unicode character, as the awesome bar itself does.

can we get a mentor for this?
Hi.
I would like to help solving this bug.
Could someone please give me a hint about where in the code is located the style editor files and what files would need to be changed?

Thanks.
Style editor code is in browser/devtools/styleeditor

First patch to show the corresponding characters in the style editor

This is my first patch for this bug.
I copied the function losslessDecodeURI(aURI) from browser.js to emulate the behavior of the awesome bar.

I tested a HTML file with this stylesheet includes:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="☙.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css?стиль&somethingElse_☙_hello">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="стиль.css">

All the file names were properly displayed in the style editor.

The only strange behavior (which also happens in the awesome bar) is when you include the "%" character in an URL, along with non english characters, like this:
http://localhost/test/test.html?стиль_abc%def.css

In that case, the awesome bar will display the URL as: http://localhost/test/test.html?%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C_abc%def.css

and the style editor will display the stylesheet include <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="стиль_abc%def.css"> as %D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C_abc%def.css .

Please let me know if something needs to be changed or done differently.

Thanks.

First patch to show the corresponding characters in the style editor

Thanks for this patch. It seems to me that the displayed name can just be decoded lossy here, as it's only purpose is being displayed -- as opposed to the location bar, it can't be copied or edited here and won't be used to make further HTTP requests.

So I think all you want here is call decodeURI and be done with it.

Second version of the patch to show the corresponding characters in the style editor

This patch uses the function decodeURI() to decode the characters from the stylesheet filename displayed in the Style Editor of the Web Developer tool.

decodeURI can throw, so you'll need to wrap this in try/catch.

Third version of the patch to show the corresponding characters in the style editor

Added a try/catch for the decodeURI function call.

Thanks!

I suppose we have no tests for this that need to be updated.
Hi.
Thanks for the review.

Does this patch need to be executed in the try server?

I'll push to inbound later if it's green and a devtools reviewer gives r+.
