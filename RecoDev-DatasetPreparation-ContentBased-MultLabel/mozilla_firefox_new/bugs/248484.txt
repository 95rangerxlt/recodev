I just installed Firefox 0.9 on MacOS X.  When I deleted all the entries in the
bookmarks toolbar folder via Manage Bookmarks, the bookmarks themselves
dissaspeared, but the toobar itself is still sitting there empty.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete all entries in bookmarks toolbar folder

2. et Voila
Actual Results:  
The toolbar was still visible, empty.

Expected Results:  
The toolbar should have dissapeared when empty.

No themes or extensions installed, completely clean install.

I delete all the default bookmarks on the toolbar before I start adding my own.
 I wouldn't want the toolbar to suddenly disappear just as I'm about to add
something to it for the first time.
You can add your own again, through bookmarking and adding it to the bookmark
toolbar folder.  For those that do not use that toolbar, it is not good that it
is there.  

However, I have just discovered that you can turn it off.  

In earlier versions of FF, the bar automatically dissapeared when all bookmarks
were deleted.  Is the fact that that does not happen now a bug, or a designed
feature?
It would be ok for me if the toolbar disappeared only after a restart, because I
usually don't delete the default bookmarks before adding my own.  If anyone used
the bookmarks toolbar only for holding temporary bookmarks, the toolbar
disappearing would annoy them.
> I usually don't delete the default bookmarks before adding my own

I meant "I usually don't delete the default bookmarks without adding my own
immediately afterward."
Ok, it does close after restart, I have just found out.  

Thanks for the input, I am moving this bug to FIXED now.
