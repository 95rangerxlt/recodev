Whenever I check for updates to my extensions and themes manually, the checkbox
to autocheck for updates to my extensions and themes is automatically unchecked.
 Even though I sometimes like to check for updates manually doesn't mean I would
like to check manually _all_ the time....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up DPa1
2. Go to Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Update
3. Check the box labeled "My Extensions and Themes"
4. Click the "Check Now..." button under the aforementioned checkbox
5. Click the "Finish" or "Cancel" buttons to exit the update window (doesn't
matter if it's done checking or not)
6. Notice that now the "My Extensions and Themes" checkbox is unchecked.


Expected Results:  
The autoupdate extensions and themes checkbox should have remained checked (FF
1.0.4 does this perfectly).

its a bug, yes, but not something we'll hold 1.8b3 for at the last minute...
As a side note, this ONLY happens when you do a "Check Now..." in PrefWindow V.
 This does NOT happen when you are in the Extensions manager and right-click an
extension and choose to check for updates for that extension.

So this seems to confirm that it is a problem in PrefWindow V.
sounds like its the exact same problem that happened with the app update thing.
Mike Conner said that this bug will not block 1.8b3.

Previously, the preference attribute was set on the button (which I saw is NOT
set on the DP check now button). Removing the attribute fixes this bug for me.
Seems to be the correct way to me.
This is not the right fix, I don't think. We were using this preference as a way
to control the disabled state of this button based on the lockedness of the
autoUpdateEnabled pref. Perhaps, instead, there should be a separate
disable_buttons preference to do this. Either way, this patch removes
functionality.

Didn't see the locked pref thing. Thanks.

Two questions though:

1) Will bug 296566 have any impact on this?

2) Will a small js hack be appropriate to keep the checkbox checked?

I am not sure I understand what you are saying.  Is the intent here to prevent
an automatic check for extension update to fire during a manual chaeck?
