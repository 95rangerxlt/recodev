I can reprocude it, even at another website (www.gayromeo.com) with frames. The
(small) bottom frame disappears on opening a second tab. After reloading or
resizing the window it returns.

-> Mozilla bug

In order to reproduce the bug, you have to disable the option "Hide the tab bar,
when only one tab is open" ("Tab-Leiste verstecken, wenn nur ein Tab angezeigt
wird".

I've seen this bug on Mozilla 1.7.6, 1.7.7 and 1.7.8 it's still repoducable.
The bug is unchanged and visible as described above.
Workarounds: After resize, the complete Page is visible.
