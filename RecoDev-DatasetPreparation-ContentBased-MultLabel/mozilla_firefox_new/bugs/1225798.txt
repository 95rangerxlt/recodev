+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1225466 +++

There's a trivial mistake in the error handling here:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a2f83cbe53ac4009afa4cb2b0b8f549289b23eeb/browser/components/migration/MSMigrationUtils.jsm#479

where the use of 'dbPath' should be 'dbFile.path'

We should also be reporting errors correctly so the parent migrator doesn't pretend all is fine and dandy when the reading list import failed.

I reproduced one issue with the migrator if the DB had outstanding changes in its log files that hadn't yet been reconciled into the DB, at which point the DB is in an "unclean shutdown" state.

I don't know how easy it is to fix that, but fixing it properly should probably be a different bug.

Reading list should have probably been it's own migrator of the bookmark type (we support multiple of each) so we didn't have to do this more complicated success/error handling as we could just throw and have the aCallback(false) used. 

I normally prefer to default to succeeded = false too which that would make easier.

I guess this is okay for now.

Please ensure that no errors are reported in relatively clean IE install perhaps due to some custom URL scheme being used.

I ended up moving all the things anyway as suggested in comment #2 because of how the edge bookmarks have moved as well (bug 1226556). In part 1 I also added logging for unknown JET errors so we can find out what goes wrong on users' machines if they file bugs with NS_ERROR_FAILURE as the exception.

Seems like this should be reportError but I'm not sure if that's much harder.

I didn't get to this the other day because of the large code movement and RB doesn't help with that when it's between filesâ€¦

Nit: why not `EdgeReadingListMigrator`?

Isn't it a memory leak? I think you should be able to just use "wchar_t msg[80];" here.

Seems like you're fixing this in bug 1228482.
