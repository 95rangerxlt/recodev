Works for me using Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6a)

Have you tested with a clean profile?  Do you have any extensions installed?  If
you check the javascript console, are there any errors? (Open the console, clear
it, open prefs to that pane, click okay, then report what appears in the JS
console, if anything).

Please also try with a clean install and profile.


Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:

With a new profile it works fine until I check the "Save all files to this
folder" option.

Yeah, only seems to fail if the Desktop Folder is selected. If you select any
other folder, it'll close fine. The "Show Folder" button also fails to do
anything if the Desktop Folder is selected.

There seems to be an easy temp. workaround. Select "Other..." from the folder
list, and then highlight your desktop from the selection pane. That seems to get
it working.

Maybe the "Desktop Folder" option simply isn't associated with a real folder path?

I want to confirm all the details of this bug in the 0.7 branch release. 

It seems to be that Desktop isn't associated with the real path, cause as soon
as I browse and actually select the Desktop, it's fine. When it's set-up the
original way, once I hit the Downloads pane of the Preferences panel, it won't
close with OK, only with 'Cancel.' This is true even if I then move to another
pane. It still won't close once I have viewed downloads, as long as the "Save
all files to this folder" option is set to "Desktop."
WFM on 20031024/Mac.
WFM too. It was still broken on 20031023, but fixed on 20031024.

sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


Ok button on Downloads preferences pane does nothing (problem with save all files to this folder option)
