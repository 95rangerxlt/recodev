When
1) Trying to add bugzilla to sidebar
2) Trying to install another search engine
3) Searching for a bug via main page of Bugzilla (bugzilla.mozilla.org)

I get errors in JavaScript console and no expected result.
Tried on clean install (ZIPped Aviary build) and clean profile. When I have
tried Firebord 0.7, it worked.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to bugzilla.mozilla.org
2. search for any text (form below "Enter a bug # or some search terms:")


Actual Results:  
Error appears in the web page that loads, additionally in the JavaScript console
an error related to nsSidebar.js shows up:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIRDFService.GetDataSource]"  nsresult:
"0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)"  location: "JS frame ::
file:///F:/Program%20Files/mozilla.org/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/nsSidebar.js
:: nsSidebar :: line 67"  data: no]

Same (or very similar) error appears in the case of installing a search engine
or when trying to add bugzilla to sidebar.

I wanted to try to reproduce the 'Add bugzilla to sidebar' part
of this, but I couldn't see how. Is it possible to add bugzilla to
the sidebar in Firefox.

Is this the Mycroft Extension? Anything to do with Custom Keywords?
On bugzilla.mozilla.org, you have a link entitled "Add to Sidebar (Requires
Mozilla or Netscape 6/7)", pointing to javascript:addSidebar() . That is what
I've meant -- some 2 weeks ago it worked on Firefox, now it doesn't (for me).
I can confirm this in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7)
Gecko/20040530 Firefox/0.8.0+

The lines in nsSidebar.js where the error occurs are the following:

    this.datasource_uri = getSidebarDatasourceURI(PANELS_RDF_FILE);
    debug('datasource_uri is ' + this.datasource_uri);
    this.resource = 'urn:sidebar:current-panel-list';
    this.datasource = this.rdf.GetDataSource(this.datasource_uri);

panels.rdf isn't getting packaged with these new Branch builds.  Thus, if you
start out with a clean profile, it never gets copied into it, so
getSidebarDatasourceURI(PANELS_RDF_FILE); fails.  This makes this.datasource_uri
null, and this.rdf.GetDataSource(null); promptly dies.  It's possible to work
around this by copying panels.rdf from an old profile (Firefox 0.8 release
worked for me) into the new profile or into the defaults/profile directory where
Firefox gets installed.

Kind of annoying that it makes it impossible to do searches from
bugzilla.mozilla.org even if you don't use the sidebar.
Copying panels.rdf from previous installation to 
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\profile 
is a workaround.
Setting ?ing 0.9
Thank you for your kind response.

I followed your instructions, and a 'Bugzilla' item appeared in my 'Personal
Toolbar', clicking this (http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/sidebar.cgi) caused a
Bugzilla sidebar to open.

I got these warnings:

++DOMWINDOW == 31

Is this the desired behaviour? If so then then this bug is at least close
to Fixed or WFM.

I think that there are major HCI issues with this feature, however!

This bug applies only when using newly-created profile, as stated above. If you
have panels.rdf in your profile, all works fine.
