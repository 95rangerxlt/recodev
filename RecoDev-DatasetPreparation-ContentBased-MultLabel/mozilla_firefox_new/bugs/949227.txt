The test fails locally always, and looks like on try/linux quite often once
bug 930793 lands.
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=1f0ae9ca7c0e (contains various other stuff too)
And when I say fails locally always, I mean even without bug 930793.
How does it fail without this patch? There shouldn't be any reason to have to wait for delayedStartup to close the window...
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/general/browser_bug609700.js | Found an unexpected tab at the end of test run: about:blank

<smaug> http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#967 is the reason
<smaug> that all happens in _delayedStartup

So the test needs to wait for delayedStartup because otherwise duplicateTabIn leaves a tab around in the opening window.
