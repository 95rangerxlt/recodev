The Answers.com plugin shows up in the search engine list as "Dictionary".
Rafael tells me this needs to show up as "Answers.com" for contractual reasons. 

Benjamin, this will have a l10n impact.

Since basically no localizers are using answers.com, this really doesn't have a
l10n impact.

To clarify, not for "contractual reasons".  Answers.com is their brand and
dictionary is a generic term that doesn't represent all that they do.
Well now, if it's not for contractual reasons then perhaps this should have more
finesse. We want a dictionary-like searchplugin, and the text "answers.com"
gives no indication that you are likely to get a definition.

why aren't we using this one?
Actually let me rephrase.

Was there something wrong with the search query from the Answers.com plug-in?

 method="get"
 action="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery"
 searchForm="http://www.answers.com/"
 queryEncoding='UTF-8'
 queryCharset='UTF-8'
>

<input name="s" user >
<input name="method" value="2" >
<input name="gwp" value="13">

</search>
----

Everything else looks fine with ben's plug-in, the description, the browser
update info that you have e.g.
"http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/plugins/answers.src" 

That's all correct.
