Jim, is that right? Is this glyph provided and colored through nsNativeTheme.cpp? That's what it looks like to me...
I'm not sure. mbrubeck was working on these elements for highdpi and was having a hard time finding the code that rendered them. I haven't had a chance to look at this but can.

I mean, I guess the end of the story will be that we'll need to override it (with an image) specifically for the bookmarks menu, so I can work from there. Unless you have time to do exactly that? :-)

I don't know, can you post a screen shot of what the issue is or str to reproduce? I have no context.

Sure. Here's a screenshot. Basically, the issue is that we use non-native styling and so the white arrow for submenus is invisible. It should be using the black one throughout. I suspect we'll just need to provide an image and use that for all versions of Windows. Might be able to reuse an image that's in the tree already.
Stephen, can you provide assets we can use here, probably for both Windows and Linux?
Is this what you are looking for : http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/ident?i=NS_THEME_MENUARROW ?
Btw, this hack might work :
.subviewbutton .menu-right {
   color: black !important;
}

No, I know about that code. It uses native Windows code to render the arrow, and there's no real way to influence that without altering our widget code, which would be weird. We simply need .png images to replace these arrows (which are done through so -moz-appearance: menuarrow).

No, that does not work. Nor will anything else along those lines: the code for the color of the arrow doesn't look at CSS at all.

Based on the arrows in shorlanders mockup, but adjusted to meet the default Windows colors.

Alright, how is this, Mike? Tested on Win XP Luna and Win7 Aero.
This needs to be done for Linux too, I'm afraid...
Apart from that, re. code it looks a-ok to me!

Now with linux support. Needed a height/width setting because menu.css sets those, and otherwise the icon looks warped.

Review of attachment 8389185:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Since the two images are identical, can you place it in ../shared/places/bookmarks-menu-arrow.png and update the jar.mn entries?

I also was able to have off 33% using ImageOptim.app here...

The CSS looks good. Shame of the code duplication, but that can not be avoided.

So this hunk disappeared. Sticking this in bug 969592 because I noticed it there.
