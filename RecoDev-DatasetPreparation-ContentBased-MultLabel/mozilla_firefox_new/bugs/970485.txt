In some cases, `CustomizableUI.getWidget(domNode.id).forWindow(window).anchor` raises a "`aWidget` is not defined" exception.

To be more precise, asking for the anchor in this code is always working:

https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/master/lib/sdk/widget.js#L456

Where if I try to move that part of code here:

https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/blob/master/lib/sdk/panel/utils.js#L136

is failing all the time. The problem seems the getter of `anchor` property.

Is CUI.getWidget(id).forWindow(window).node null, by any chance?
No, the `node` returns the same `domNode` where we get the id:

    console.log(CUI.getWidget(domNode.id).forWindow(window).node === domNode) // true
    console.log(CUI.getWidget(domNode.id).forWindow(window).anchor) // ReferenceError: aWidgetId is not defined
