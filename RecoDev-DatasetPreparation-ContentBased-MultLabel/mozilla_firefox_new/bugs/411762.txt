sent mail to the mozdev list to see if someone knew status.  that's the only contact info I could find.

http://optimoz.mozdev.org/list.html

There is a nightly at http://www.mousegestures.org/nightly.html

Currently (Fx 2008020904) MozGest breaks toolbar customization though
I think that this problem is not a MozGest bug.
As far as I can see, Fx3 is far away from something stable that 
extension developers can rely on. (e.g. bug 415099)

There will be further development of MozGest, but the "Optimoz Project"
is somewhat dead and the new site (mousegestures.org) is not ready 
for prime time.

In case of MozGest you can for now contact me directly or wait until the new
site and forum is online.

Sorry for the spam.

Hi Jochen,

the last beta has now been released and should be pretty stable.  I see a recent update on  http://www.mousegestures.org/nightly.html   Do you know if that one is ready to submit to addons.mozilla.org  push out to beta 5 users

There is over a million beta 5 users and I'm sure many would like to see an update for mouse guestures.
There will be a major update of MozGest within the next two weeks.

BTW:
When will there be a major update of Fx?

Great!

> BTW:

RC1 should ship near the end of April or early May. If you are working with the nightlies, you should be working with the RC.

Will it be possible to use "3.0.*" as maxVersion on AMO when Fx RC1 is out?

Yes, once the RC is out, 3.0 will be available as a maxVer.

What a beauty.

Could it be that AMO is turning into developers nightmare?
I have not found a way to seriously answer to "bullshit reviews".

Hey Jochen, could you elaborate a bit? There have definitely been some concerns with AMO -- and we're trying to get issues resolved. Is there something in particular that keep you from getting Mouse Gestures on AMO?
Mouse Gestures will be submitted.

But to comment reviews like the one by raseru on April 25, 2008
seems to be impossible. He is talking about things that where never
ever touched by MozGest. (But by AiO)

And there is no possibility to react (fast) on reviews like that.

So for the next week or so there will one thing fure sure about MozGest:
It will disable "middle mouse scrolling".

What a bullshit.

If you have a reaction comment, please post it and let us know, we can push it through if appropriate. We always want to help make sure that the reviews on AMO are helpful and accurate. If you think the comment is completely inappropriate, we can remove it. In fact, if there is any problem at all, feel free to email amo-editors@mozilla.org, or me personally. 

Thank you so much for developing such a great add-on!

My first reaction was posted. Lost? Pech gehabt!
Is it really so that a comment takes at least a week to go public?
If this is the case, please make it public asap. For users and for developers.


Approved. Sorry for the delay. Cache will have to expire, so it might be a little bit before it shows up on the site.
Thanks Alex!

Can someone assign this bug to me?
(If it's possible)
That was fast!

MozGest 2.0 will be released within the next week.
( http://www.mousegestures.org/preview.html )
MozGest 2.0.0 has been uploaded. 

Even if MozGest will not be approved by AMO, this bug can be resolved.
-> fixed
I've removed MozGest 2.0.0 because of crashes under Windows (Vista ?).

Currently I'm not in the physical shape to keep up with the overall development.

Changing resolution:
-> WONTFIX (for now)
Jochen,

Would you be willing to allow other developers (maybe mozilla ones) access to source -- so they can try to fix it?
Sounds to me that you know where the bug is...

Sorry for the spam! Wrong bug.

Alex,

As I've said before I'm currently not in the shape to do something serious,
although I think I know where the bugs are.

Fixed.
