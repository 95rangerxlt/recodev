I keep trying...
On:
<http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_window_ref34.html#1017509>
There's: "Moves the window to the specified coordinates."
On:
<http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/dom_window_ref90.html#1019942>
There's:"Dynamically resizes window."

And on:
http://www.mozilla.org/events/dev-day-feb-2004/mozilla-futures/title.html
I have resizeTo() & moveTo().
I saved this page and done some greps:

olecom@gluon:~$ grep /tmp/title_files/*.js -e move
olecom@gluon:~$ grep /tmp/title_files/*.js -e resize
/tmp/title_files/config.js:// resize the window to a good viewable size
/tmp/title_files/config.js:var resizeOnLoad = true;
/tmp/title_files/mozpoint.js:  if (resizeOnLoad) {
/tmp/title_files/mozpoint.js:        window.resizeTo(800, 640);
/tmp/title_files/mozpoint.js:        window.resizeTo(1024, 768);
olecom@gluon:~$

So, aftet all I think, that what happend with FireFox 0.8/Mozilla 1.6 is "Boogs"

Yes, but maybe this case is distro specific ? Well, I am here to check it.

As I said
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031210
have not such feature. But it's not dynamicaly linked with
libxpcom
libglib-2.0 and friends (see attach)
and others

This bug also is on `Debian Bug report logs - #249213`

Goodbye and thanks.

shared library dependencies of firefox 0.8 and Mozilla 1.6b

maybe usefull, maybe not
js solution is obvious, for example:

var scrX = window.screenX, scrY = window.screenY;
window.resizeTo(1014, 740);
window.moveTo(scrX, scrY);

in
firefox-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz           03-Jun-2004 09:40  7.8M
solved.
But there're some small issue with different window managers.
icewm OK, fluxbox & wmaker are little top-left moved.



Initial resizing of browser window hides window manager's top line with {move, close, iconify}
