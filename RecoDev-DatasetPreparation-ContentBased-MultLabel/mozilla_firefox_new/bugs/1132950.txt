It's not a bug directly introduced by bug 1125636.

The bug comes from https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/shared/in-content/common.inc.css#686

There are two solutions:
1. Change the CSS code to not show the arrow when the empty attribute "sortDirection" is set.
2. Check where the "sortDirection" is set in JS and not removed when a other column is the active sort column.

For 1. I could fix this, but I think 2. would be cleaner but I'm not a JS specialist.

Looks like we could do with just the config.js changes. Any reason that we need to make the changes for common.inc.css? Presence of an attribute in XUL-land is pretty common to mean that it should be enabled.

I guess so, I just want to prevent this in the future.

Yeah, not necessary though. Let's keep this change small and only do the config.js change.

Also, we shouldn't use :-moz-any() as the right-most selector: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:any#Issues_with_performance_and_specificity

r=me for only the config.js changes.
