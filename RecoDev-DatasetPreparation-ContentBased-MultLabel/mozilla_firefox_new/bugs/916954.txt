Fix windows focus-originated bc orange by closing the panel we open, rs=bustage

I just landed this, and verified locally that it fixes the timeout, which is apparently caused by our Windows focus code not dealing with opening a window, opening a panel in it, and then closing the parent window (and thereby the panel). So we end up with a nulled out activeWindow in the focus manager, which broke the test flow. I'll file a followup bug on our focus code regarding this if one doesn't already exist.
