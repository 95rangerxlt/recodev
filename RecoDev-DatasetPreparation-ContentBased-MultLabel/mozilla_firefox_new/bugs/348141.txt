Currently there is very little visible effect when you encounter an autodetected search engine and add it from the menu: the button stops glowing.  Adding an engine should also choose it as your current engine, and clear and focus the searchbox.

The fix for this bug is contained in the patch for bug 339735, but even if that doesn't land in FF2, this part should.

I agree that we need a stronger visible effect after adding it. I think I like the idea of just showing picking at as the current default, though we could also use a notification box in Info state to show a message:

The "Radiant Core Blog Search" engine was added to your Search Provider list.

(or something similar). I think I prefer just selecting it as the new default because it doesn't require a second click to close the notification, but it does mean we're setting your default menu for you.
I'd say that since you've just chosen an item from a menu, having to dismiss an additional message would be too annoying.  Likewise, since you've just chosen something from the same menu you use to select a new engine, it's not too jarring to have that action also select the engine.
Sold! I'm with Pam.
Not a blocker, but we'd definitely take the polish patch!

_useNow defaults to true; adding an engine focuses the searchbar

This has already been reviewed by ben as part of the larger patch for bug 339735.  Additional comments are, of course, welcome.
Landing on trunk to bake.

The only downside I've encountered here is that, since we haven't pre-loaded the engine description before showing it in the menu, it can take a fraction of a second (depending on network speeds) to load its icon into the engine button when it's added.

_useNow defaults to true; adding an engine focuses the searchbar

Changes _useNow to default to true and selects and focuses the searchbar when an autodetected engine is added.  This is a low-risk patch with no l10n impact, whose only quirk encountered so far is mentioned above.

a=drivers, please land on MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH ... my bad, I didn't notice that it had baked for a day already.
Landing on branch.


Adding an autodetected search engine should choose it too
