there by using NO_DIST_INSTALL=1... also fix a confusing double negative with
MOZ_STANDALONE_NONBROWSER_XULAPP nonsense

tidy up
Can you please set NO_INSTALL as well?  Otherwise, builds packaged using 'make
install' will grab the wrong chrome.

OK... I added NO_INSTALL and a comment explaining why I'm using these for
MOZ_PHOENIX only... checked in. 


Consolidate makefiles in xpfe/ and xpfe/components/
