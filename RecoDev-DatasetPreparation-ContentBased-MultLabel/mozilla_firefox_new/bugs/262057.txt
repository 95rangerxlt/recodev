patch to migrate those prefs
on request of submitter
->NEW

This patch is made against 0.10 (1.0PR) but I've seen no change on trunk.

Let me explain why I consider this important:
1. the UI for those settings is available in firefox since some time
2. the firefox default setting is en-US for intl.accept_languages
   This means that every http request requests en-US as accepted language
   This behaviour is not really good because "Multiviews" enabled webservers
   will always respond their pages for en-US instead their own default.
   e.g. webservers within de TLD will most likely use german as default language
   but if you connect with firefox you will get the english language.
   Because of this the UI is really needed and important (and was added 
   sometime ago)
   And therefore I recommend to migrate those settings out of an existing
   seamonkey profile.
Please edit the file in place, and use "cvs diff -up
mozilla/browser/components/migration/src/nsSeamonkeyProfileMigrator.cpp" to
create the patch.

And you should request review from someone specific, like bugs@bengoodger.com.

the problem is that I don't know whom to ask for review. Thanks for the hint.

mconnor, can you review this (IMHO trivial) fix? thanks
