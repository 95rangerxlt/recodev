I am having this problem as well in Friefox 0.9

When I CTRL click a link to open it in a new tab it reloads the current tab I am
viewing, wiping out an information I have entered into forms, as well as jumping
to the top of the page and then back to where I was reading.
Works for me. Can you all reproduce this on a new profile?

I'm seeing something just like this in Seamonkey for OS X 10.3.4, Mozilla 1.8a2
2004071408 -- notable flicker, frequently repeated, with open tabs (I don't
think it's resetting any forms). As I'm typing the flicker is repeating -- so
far, 6 or so times in 1 minute. Was not happening in 1.7 final
Ok, problems fixed in newest Editon of Firefox!
Since these problems weren't actually fixed per Bugzilla's guidelines (patch
must be attached, blah blah), it probably should be marked WORKSFORME, as seen
from other bugs that were "fixed" upon new build or profile.

When you open a new tab, then enter ANY website, the screen flickers on both my computers
