Nullcheck theDir before converting to a URL
Can we write a test for this?
This breaks addons that use the file picker too, like Fabrice's b2gremote addon.

The filepicker API blocks until the user responds to the dialog. So, only if we have a test framework in which we can interact with the system's native dialogs. Do we? I am not aware of one. :-(

When saving the ScratchPad, execution doesn't reach nsFilePicker::PutLocalFile, so the native file save dialog is not displayed.

By contrast, nsFilePicker::PutLocalFile is called by "Save Page As…" and performs as expected.

The call chain is probably different and likely short returns on the way to calling PutLocalFile. We have to investigate this.

theDir is checked for null a few lines above, and we make sure it's assigned either @"" or @"/Applications" so it can't be null any more.
Well, sorry, theDir is checked for null only in GetLocalFiles. And indeed an exception is thrown in PutLocalFile at
[thePanel setDirectoryURL:[[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath:theDir isDirectory:YES]] when theDir is null.

But why is theDir set when saving a page, and null when saving the scratchpad?

Because you're allowed to not set it and have it use the last-used directory (OS X keeps track of that), rather than a pre-set one.
