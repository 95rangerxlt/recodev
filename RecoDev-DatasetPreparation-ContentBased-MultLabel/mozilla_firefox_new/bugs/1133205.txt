Simple but effective fix.

Patrick, do we need tests for this ?

Please use the XHTML_NS const instead.
Before R+'ing this, I'd like to know the steps the reproduce and what fails exactly.
I've quickly tested a few things that seemed to work, so obviously, I'm not testing the right thing.
About the test, I do think we need one :)
But let's see those STR first.

STR :
- open the inspector on an SVG document
- inspect an element
- try to create a style, or edit an inline style
- non-inline styles may fail as well, but I haven't checked

AR :
- the style isn't updated (you can set the fill to red if you want an obvious indicator)
- you get this error into the browser console : tempElement.style is undefined (or null, I don't remember)

ER :
- the style should be updated
Ah thanks! I was testing on SVG elements inside an HTML document.
I was able to reproduce the issue just now.
So, the patch looks fine, but I'd like a test added in /browser/devtools/styleinspector/test
It doesn't need to be complex, but it should at least:
- open a SVG document
- open the style-inspector
- try to add an inline style in the 'element' rule
- check that the style was applied correctly.

To check that a style change did work, you can do something like this:

is((yield getComputedStyleProperty(selector, null, "fill")), "red", "The fill was changed to red");

Now includes a test (mainly copied from the browser_ruleview_add-property-*.js files). The test fully passes.

That looks great. Could you just update that test comment?
No other remarks. Let's check this in as soon as try is green.
Thanks for fixing this!
