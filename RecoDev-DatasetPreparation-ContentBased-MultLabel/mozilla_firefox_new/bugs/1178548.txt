This file was already cleaned up, but taking a look again, we can push this further :
- There is a fill style declaration that is overriding a fill attribute. We can just set this fill once here.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/2d38fecce226/browser/themes/shared/heartbeat-star-lit.svg#l1.444
- There is a bunch of useless whitespace within the path defs
- Those fill-rule attributes can probably be removed, but I need to check first

Heh, even better, I've just found out that most of the paths in that file are offscreen, and only one of them is relevant.

When you reveal them, those off-screen paths include 2 back icons, a back icon, a forward icon, a home icon, a unfilled and filled bookmark icon, a history icon and a downloads icon.

Egh. Are there lots of whitespace changes? Why all the changes to lines that look identical? Can you either push to mozreview or attach a diff -w ? Thanks!

I don't think I can review the heartbeat SVG changes because I don't understand why that file is the way it is and why what you're doing is OK (or not). Please get review from Matt for those changes.

I don't understand why you're removing whitespace here. You do it in some places in this file, but not others, and you've moved some rules and added whitespace there. Why do we need to mess with this file quite so much? I thought just adding some classes and replacing the id attribute selectors with class selectors was going to be enough. Isn't it?

There is no need to do this.

For the heartbeat star icons, the paths I've removed appeared offscreen, those include a back/forward icon, a history icon and a downloads icon. The files clearly have `star` in their names, and looking at the UI, I suspect we only want the star.

For the heartbeat heart icon, there were some useless style resets (the first <g> element makes the shape invisible, then the children make the shapes visible again). There was also a <g> element applying a transform to the children, and some of the children also had transforms, so I combined them in one when possible.

Anyway, there were no path data change in any of the files, and I've tested these changes.

Most of our SVGs use the shorthex/hex format for colors (including the rest of the drm-icon file), it's nice to be consistent here.

Didn't realize I forgot to reply to this comment. 
I'm moving rules because I wanted to order them in a logical order.

The first block is for the symlink styles (hiding shapes depending on the url symlink).
The second block are the most global styles that affect most of the shapes.
The third block is for the theme specific styles (default, highcontrast, lw-theme, white).
The last block is for the helper styles (outer-stroke, restore-background-window)
