It appears it won't allow the space for "Icons and Text" feature.  Just "Icons" or "Text" is ok.

Reproducible: Always

Hrm, not quite the same bug.

Similar problem on Linux

Similar problem on Linux. The Back/Forward icons are a bit misplaced and they behave strangely (clicking on the text in the button opens the submenu instead of going back/forward).

Fixes original issue (toolbar text on Mac)

The max-height removed here was added for bug 347463, but as far as I can tell it can be safely removed once the lock icon is reduced to 16x16 pixels.  Mark, please speak up if this regresses 347463 in some way I haven't tested.

16x16-pixel lock icon Secure.png for pinstripe

This icon fits in the urlbar properly, so no max-height is needed and the toolbar can stretch appropriately when both icons and text are shown.

The other UI artifact shown in the first screenshot was fixed in bug 347400.  Mano said he's about to split the back- and forward-button polish from the second screenshot into another bug.
See bug 349079, we should land these in sync.

Hmm, I didn't know max-height could constrain parent elements like that, either way thanks!  r+a=me on this branch-only patch
Should I file another bug about the Linux issue?

If it's still an issue (please check with a build that has the fix for bug 348565).
Landing patch and new image on branch.  Marking as fixed since the back- and forward-button problems are being addressed in bug 349079.
The same issues exists on Windows builds when comparing the main toolbar icons with the address and searchbar icons when displaying text.  The text for the main toolbar icons looks as if it's aligned along the top of the toolbar while the address bar and searchbar text is centered vertically along the toolbar.  If you have small icons enabled then this doesn't appear to be as much of an issue as all text appears centered.

Sorry, I don't understand what problem you're describing.  I'm looking at the 2005081803 build, and nothing looks too strange.  Since the address and searchbar icons don't show text at all in the default theme, I'm guessing you're using another theme.  Could you post a screenshot, please?

Oops, sorry, my previous comment was a mistake.
