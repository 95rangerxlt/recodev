Currently they are completely disabled but many of them appear to work and there are probably common problems for the ones that don't. Enable the ones that work and either fix or file specific bugs on the ones that don't.

Taking, as everything else I'm doing is waiting for review/feedback/needinfo.

I was misled by trychooser (bug 1087382) and thought this still only ran on Linux, so I'll need to rerun this against OS X and Windows. Locally on OS X, this set passed. It seems to do on Linux, too, although there's a failure in some panorama test (?!) which isn't filed yet... retriggering at the moment to see if that's intermittent or what.

I'll look at the 3 tests the patch disabled later today or tomorrow to see what my odds of fixing them immediately are.

I'll need to look in more detail at the searchbar_in_panel thing, I'll file a bug on that either late tonight or when I get back on Monday.

[DEFAULT] already makes us skip if buildapp == mulet, so we can probably remove this line.
