We want to ship the following installer change (Windows only) as part of March's Funnelcake edition, tentatively scheduled to ship on Tuesday, 3/24.

The project wiki page is at https://wiki.mozilla.org/InstallFeedback.  And the embed URL for the Kampyle feedback form is:

Once this bug is resolved, we'll be able to test the installer and feedback form before shipping Funnelcake07.

Kampyle Instructions

Here are the instructions from their site.
Are we going to host that page on mozilla.com in an iframe? Users might react negatively to us loading web pages from a non-Mozilla.com host.
The code for the installer should be:
http://www.kampyle.com/feedback_form/ff-feedback-form.php?site_code=8166124&form_id=12116

Please note the change from what I wrote in comment #0.
Gavin -- that's a really good suggestion.  We're planning to launch this for a
single day sometime in the next couple weeks.  If we do consider implementing
this beyond our one-day test (e.g., something longer-term or permanent), a
mozilla.com hosted page will definitely be among our top requirements.
some additional instructions...

Kampyle allows the feedback/reporting to be broken down by the installation "step" that the user cancels from within the installer.  In our implementation, we can label each step (I'm defining "step" as each chance that the user has to hit "cancel").  Here's how it works:

Instead of simply implementing http://www.kampyle.com/feedback_form/ff-feedback-form.php?site_code=8166124&form_id=12116, we implement:

http://www.kampyle.com/feedback_form/ff-feedback-form.php?site_code=8166124&form_id=12116&url=step1
http://www.kampyle.com/feedback_form/ff-feedback-form.php?site_code=8166124&form_id=12116&url=step2
http://www.kampyle.com/feedback_form/ff-feedback-form.php?site_code=8166124&form_id=12116&url=step3
etc.

step1, step2, step3, etc. can be whatever we want to name them (e.g., we can use more intuitive names).
Ken, can you or anyone else provide me with a link to a funnelcake build so I can look at the file structure? Thanks
Kev or Jeremy -- can you provide Rob with a link to a funnelcake build?
fyi: I should be able to have the patch finished by tomorrow. From there it will need to be reviewed and landed which shouldn't take more than a day to two days

I tried accessing that earlier via http with my ldap password without success so can you grant me access?
There are a total of 6 pages the user can cancel the installation from... these pages are: Welcome, Options, Directory, Shortcuts, StartMenu, and Summary

Patch in progress

Still need the directory structure for an installer with funnelcake before I can finish this up.

I used comment #5 for url construction with the url
http://www.kampyle.com/feedback_form/ff-feedback-form.php?site_code=8166124&form_id=12116&url=stepn
where n is the numeric step the user aborted on

The pages relate to the steps as follows
1 = Welcome
2 = Options
3 = Directory
4 = Shortcuts
5 = StartMenu
6 = Summary

The text and buttons still need to be worked out with beltzner

I wasn't able to come up with decent text for a Yes / No / Cancel messagebox and instead went with a Yes / No messagebox with the text "Would you like to tell us why you are canceling this installation?"

This doesn't give the user the option of canceling the cancel like they normally can which I think is acceptable since the instruction to the user is more clear and concise this way.

Also, which button should be default?

patch rev1
The urls outlined in comment #12 look good.
Note: this will enable the survey when aborting the installer whenever the installer locale is en-US and there is a distribution.ini with a '[Global]' section with an 'about' section entry that has the string Funnelcake (case insensitive) within the full string.

patch rev1

Noticed one little comment typeo - "; Cacnel = don't exit."

I was also going to suggest using icon question rather than icon exclamation for the question dialog, but I guess ms depreciated that, so I guess exclamation is the right thing to do.

It is also the default for these messageboxes in nsis

1.9.0.8 is done. Definitely wouldn't take a fix like this until after it's in 1.9.1, but even then it's hard to argue this is in scope with our branch security updates. Have the localization issues been cleared w/Axel or SethB?

The string is hardcoded and only used with en-US (comment #18 has the conditions) and Funnelcake is en-US only as well.

I didn't think we wanted to do this permanently without a slightly better UI? Am I missing some context, here? Is Kampyle always going to be running?
Think the idea was to have the infrastructure in the installer to run more of these anytime with a low touch from dev, but not run it all the time.  Correction anyone?

I personally don't think having three choices as follows is better for the funnelcake builds
a) fill out survey and exit
b) don't fill out survey and exit
c) don't exit

As it stands it is
a) fill out survey and exit
b) don't fill out survey and exit

Also, the process can be restarted.

I'll spend some more time investigating the options available via NSIS to provide non-standard Windows UI for this. I considered displaying the finish page with this info after displaying the standard "are you sure" dialog which would then allow the user to fill out the survey though that would add steps. Another option would be to create a non-standard messagebox which would likely require creating an NSIS plugin since the source code was lost for the only existing one I have found.

> Is Kampyle always going to be running?

It is automatically enabled under the following scenario

This allows the funnelcake repackaging to enable it without additional work performed by anyone.

Drivers, this has landed on both trunk and mozilla-1.9.1. I'd like to get it for 1.9.0.9 to lessen the amount of work needed for funnelcake releases.

Are these strings an internal state marker, or are they displayed? If displayed what keeps them from showing up in localized installers? Are the modified functions _only_ used by the survey process?

They are state markers and are not displayed.

The CustomAbort function is used for all locales when aborting.

When aborting with a funnelcake build that is en-US per

the other new functions will be used.

When any of these conditions aren't met the CustomAbort function is still used and it duplicates the existing behavior where the MOZ_MUI_TEXT_ABORTWARNING string is used to give the user the option to not abort the installer.

Since this installer is not part of standard 1.9.0 builds, how do I verify this fix for 1.9.0.11? Is there a funnelcake build for 1.9.0.11 available?
No, but there will be shortly after we ship (I think a week or two?). This can't be verified until then, or at least until Funnelcake builds are started.
The best that can be done without a funnelcake build is to:
1. extract an installer using 7-Zip http://www.7-zip.org/
2. inside the extracted directory create a new directory named distribution inside the nonlocalized directory.
3. create a new file named distribution.ini inside the new distribution directory.
4. add the following to the distribution.ini file

[Global]
about=Funnelcake Test

5. launch the setup.exe in the root of the directory of the originally extracted installer.
Thanks. I verified using the steps in comment 42 for 1.9.0.11.
