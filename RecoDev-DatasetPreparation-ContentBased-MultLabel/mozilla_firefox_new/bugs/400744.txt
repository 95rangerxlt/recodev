WinDbg output / stack trace from Windows 2003

This is what WinDbg output reported when run on a retail (sorry, not a debug version) Windows 2003 machine. I also tried a Windows XP machine, but was could not get WinDbg to give me a stack trace; instead, the "Pure virtual function call" dialog appeared instead. On the Windows 2003 box, the "Pure virtual function call" dialog did not appear.

WinDbg output / stack trace from Windows 2003

In order o use windbg w/ firefox, you need to have symbols, see: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/How_to_get_a_stacktrace_with_WinDbg

I think this is one of a dozen pages that migh explain how to get a talkback incident id (again, you don't need it for the incident you've already reported as I retrieved it in comment 5):
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Talkback
This is worksforme, using:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8

John, if you can reproduce this consistently, you could try out older branch builds (directories ending with mozilla-1.8) to see in which of the builds it started crashing: 
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/
WFM, Firefox 2.0.0.8 on Windows XP, Vista and Linux.

John, can you reproduce the crash in Firefox Safe Mode?
(it temporarily disables add-ons and themes, this test will help us narrow
down the cause of the problem) --  See http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_Mode

Good news, bad news.

The good news is that I can reproduce the crash in safe mode, with or without a debugger. I can reproduce it in the build from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2007-10-05-03-mozilla1.8/firefox-2.0.0.8pre.en-US.win32.zip but not in the build from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2007-10-03-03-mozilla1.8/firefox-2.0.0.8pre.en-US.win32.zip . So it looks like the problematic checkin happened between 10-03 and 10-05 (thanks, Martin).

The bad news is that I can no longer reproduce the problem with the original URL http://www.bindows.net/demos/ and repro steps. I can still reproduce the problem, though, but the web site that I'm using is only on my company's intranet. (A little background here: the intranet site was written using the Bindows JavaScript toolkit from the URL above). The Bindows site may have been patched to work around the problem.

Another piece of bad news is that I cannot get a stack trace by following the instructions at http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/How_to_get_a_stacktrace_with_WinDbg . I tried WinDbg and MS VC++ 2005 Express  I get errors such as:

'firefox.exe': Loaded 'C:\ff-test\2007-10-07-03-firefox-2.0.0.8pre.en-US.win32\firefox\firefox.exe', No symbols loaded.
...snip MS binaries....
'firefox.exe': Loaded 'C:\ff-test\2007-10-07-03-firefox-2.0.0.8pre.en-US.win32\firefox\js3250.dll', No symbols loaded.
...etc....

for all of the Firefox binaries. I'm new to using a debugger, but it looks like the symbols aren't getting downloaded.
 
John, thanks for finding out the regression range.
This is a bonsai links that contains all the check-ins to the 1.8 branch:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2007-10-03+03&maxdate=2007-10-05+04&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot
Maybe somehow a regression from bug 384105?

Unfortunate that it doesn't work anymore on the bindows demo site. An example/testcase that reproducible crashes would be very helpful. 
Maybe the symbol server have symbols for 2.0.0.8?
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_the_Mozilla_symbol_server

Looks like a branch regression...
Mats, I *had* read that page on using the symbol server. I still don't get symbols downloaded to my machine. See http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Talk:Using_the_Mozilla_symbol_server for gory details.

All - sorry, I still don't have a site where it can be demoed.
The referred site, http://www.bindows.net/demos/ does no longer reproduce the problem. Since this is our public demos, we worked around the issue temporarily by adding a short break (timer) in the rendering of a context meny.

In isolated testcase posted by Marcus Better in #400976 reproduces the issue

Some additional observations: 
In some cases, the browser indeed crashes, in others such as using a slower computer or running the Linux version of 2.0.0.8, the context menu disappears just after showing.

Are there any ways to reproduce this?
The patch in bug 400976 may or may not help with this.
(In reply to comment #15)
> Are there any ways to reproduce this?

I've put an unpatched version of the demo referred to above at

  http://www.better.se/bindows/test/

for the time being.

Ooh, thanks! I reproduced it right away. Now I can check to see if the patch in 400976 really does fix it, or if it's a separate problem.

In a debug build I crashed in js_LookupPropertyWithFlags, below that it was the same as comment 5. Looks like an uninitialized variable (0xcccccccc in a debug build).
i can confirm this crash. 

Does not crash on Firefox 2.0.0.6/2.0.0.7 and does crash on Firefox 2.0.0.8 with the steps to reproduce 
The patch in bug 400976 fixes the crash for me on the test version of bindows linked from comment 16

For a potential branch update I don't think we should mark this a duplicate of bug 400976, for testing purposes and clarity.
This bug is fixed by the checkin from Bug 400976 -> Fixed

verified fixed 1.8.1.9 using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/2007102514 Firefox/2.0.0.9 (Firefox 2.0.0.9 RC1) and the testurl from comment #16. I do not crash on the RC1 on this link anymore, so adding the verified keyword.

Changed URL in bug to the test site from comment #16 (thanks, Marcus).
This was also checked into the 1.8 branch --> fixed1.8.1.10
the test case from comment #16 is no longer available, so its not possible to verify this bug for 1.8.1.10 currently

Sorry, I thought you were already done with this bug. The test case is back now. (Please tell me when I can remove it.)

hi Marcus, many thanks for putting this online again. 

I can now verify this bug also fixed for 1.8.1.10 with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/2007111504 Firefox/2.0.0.10 - no crash on testcase and so the bug is completely done verified now. 

thanks for your help again.

- adding verified keyword
We need to get a version of this test into our automated test suite, if possible.  We wouldn't want to regress this in a few days because of some other change...
