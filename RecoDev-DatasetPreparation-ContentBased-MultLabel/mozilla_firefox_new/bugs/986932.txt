You can see that the margin:0 squeezes these two elements together on OSX

It looks like this is for overriding some UA styles on Windows.  However, this causes some issues on OSX (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8396376).  My suggestion would be to find the most specific UA styles that are causing problems (probably a margin-left based on this issue) and override just that.

Also, could you add r=bgrins to the end of the commit message when you upload the next patch?

This looks good on OSX.  I've pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=08e1e0107ffb, so that I can check on Linux (I'm assuming that it looks correct on Windows since that is what you are using).

How do try builds work ? (I'm new at Firefox developing).

It runs a build in the same way as if you landed it (building and testing it).  Usually we use it to run the test suites and make sure a patch didn't break anything.  In this case, once the "B" turns green in the interface next to Linux, that means the build has finished and we can go to the build directory to grab binaries to run.

Looks like the linux builds are finished building.
