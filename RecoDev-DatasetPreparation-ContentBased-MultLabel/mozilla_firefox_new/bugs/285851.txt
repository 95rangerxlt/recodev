The first time the options dialog on OS/2 starts, it is displayed with the size
of the first panel. As this is much shorter than some of the other panels those
other panels are cut off. In addition it has a wrong title.

Use the same settings as Windows

Just use the same window title as on windows.
Similarly, an easy fix is to use the same size for the panel as on Windows.
There might be a more intelligent solution to the size problem, however, as on
Unix platforms it works without a fixed height.
Shouldn't there be two new #endifs in here too?

Better patch

Indeed, that was rubbish. This patch should work better, is easier to read and
doesn't duplicate lines.

sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
