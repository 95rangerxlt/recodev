I am not sure when it regressed, or if this is limited to my configuration.
However, this happens when Windows XP is set to classic style. This is best
described with a screenshot...

just tried it with a clean new profile: same problem
Can't reproduce in Gecko/20040928 Firefox/0.10.
This is probably a regression from the checkin for bug 245088.

This was the checkin:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=&date=explicit&mindate=2004-09-29+00%3A07&maxdate=2004-09-29+00%3A09&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot

Ross, since this checkin was after your build was made, you cannout see this. 
Please update and try again. I'm adding the regression keyword. Please ask for
blocking-status if you can confirm this, since this is a serious visual blocker.

I can't confirm this, since I'm on W2K here.
Good call Simon. Reproduced in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040929 Firefox/0.10 on WinXP.

Functionality is not affected (the minimise, maximise, close buttons don't do
anything), but it looks broken. Requesting blocking.
hey Asa, this is this issue you showed me --did you already file a bug on it?

don't hide chrome anymore
The window shouldn't have maximize or minimize buttons.  I'm going to re-open
this to get Ben's attention.

This patch makes sure that the titlebar does not appear using both Classic and
WinXP styles in WinXP. This patch has the added advantage of also making sure
that top of the customize window touches the navigation toolbox (curent builds
have a few pixel gap). I don't have access to a machine running Linux, so
someone will have to make sure this doesn't break anything (I don't think it
will).
Other sources have confirmed that this is not fully fixed. Removing the
fixed-aviary1.0 keyword.

Ben, if you intended for the window to have a titlebar, than feel free to mark
this fixed again, with my apologies for the bugspam.
Jim, look at comment 8.  Ben specifically removed the "hidechrome" attribute in
that patch.  So in response to your comment 11, his intention is definitely to
show the titlebar.

The only reason I re-opened this was to get Ben's attention to what I stated in
comment 9.  You shouldn't be able to minimize nor maximize the customize dialog.
Yeah Dean, I saw that. I interpreted this bug to mean that the reporter thought
that a titlebar should not be there. The patch Ben landed fixes the fact that
the titlebar (and window controls on it) were previously borked, but I am still
confused why we even want a titlebar. Furthermore, with the max/min buttons
hidden, you can still resize/move the customize window... do we want this as
well? The patch I attached removes the titlebar again and doesn't show a broken
titlebar under classic view (at least from my own testing). I also tied it under
several extreme browser resizes/locations (very small window, near the windows
taskbar, etc.) and the customize window behaved properly.
I really hope Ben is going to approve your patch before 1.0 Jim.
I do not think Ben deliberately changed the Customize Toolbar sheet (window?)
look, perhaps the lack of time is forcing this kind of measures.
Now that I look at it, IE creates a window when customizing, so that may be what
we are trying to emulate. Personally, I like the look of the older method and I
think it conveys drag-and-drop better than using an external window (as opposed
to the IE customize window where all customization occurs within the external
window, independent of the browser window.)  Either way, the customize window is
fine for now and if one of the devs finds some free time they can consider the
attached patch.

remove slop

Sorry to waste everyone's time. This is intended.
Re-resolving as fixed and splitting off "incompleteness" into:

Bug 264488 Customize Toolbars window should not have maximize or minimize buttons
Bug 264489 Customize Toolbars window should remember its size


Customize window look funny (titlebar, minimize/maximize/close buttons present) in latest builds when using Classic XP style

fixed-aviary1.0, regression
