Disable menu items when switching to places page. I'm going to make this bug be about disabling non-functional items, I'll have other bugs on making those that are still enabled work.

Is there a reason not to make commands a member variable, so that if commands need to be added or removed, there's only one place to do that?

Otherwise, looks good.
Done. checked in. 
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.

Places should not act like Web content (disable some menu items when Places is showing)
