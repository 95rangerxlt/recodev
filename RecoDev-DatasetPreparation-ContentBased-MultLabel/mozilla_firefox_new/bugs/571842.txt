Dao, would it be possible to add some more classes added to the new split menu for addressability in CSS? Something like:

  <menupopup>
    ...
    <hbox class="split-menuitem">
      <menuitem class="split-menuitem-item/>
      <menu class="split-menuitem-menu"/>
    </hbox>
    ...
  </menupopup>

or whatever you think is appropriate.  The key point being adding something to the hbox container and to the contained menuitem.

Sure, would you like to write the patch?

> Sure, would you like to write the patch?

Thanks, that's a nice offer.  Unfortunately, I checked my build environment and I need to update .. all of it. (Source tree, sdk, and tools.)  It might only be a day or two before that's done, or it could end up being several days by the time all the wrinkles are ironed out.

In the mean time, there's not much to this bug, so if you want me to provide edited but untested files (or file) I could do that.

Either way, I'll check back in when I can build and test, and if not this time then maybe later.

wip patch - adds classes

Very tiny patch.

If someone wants to suggest class names that better conform to naming conventions, I'll give it another go, but this seems reasonable.

I'm still running tests; I'll ask for review when that's done.

Is there any chance to implement the new split menu in XBL (e.g. <menu type="split">)?
Current hbox + menuitem + menu implementation isn't versatile for extensions.

You should file a bug on it, first of all. The chance that it will happen will also dramatically increase if you contribute a patch. ;-)
