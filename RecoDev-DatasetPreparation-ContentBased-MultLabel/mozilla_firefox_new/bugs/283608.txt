It keeps saying desktop ... but is actually changing

browser.download.dir 
and
browser.download.downloadDir

(in about:config)
A bit of clarification.

1. Go Tools > Options > Downloads > Download Folder
2. Choose "Save all files to this folder" and choose a download dir (eg: D:\)
3. Click OK, OK (to close the options window)
4. Go Tools > Options > Downloads > Download Folder
5. Notice that the download dir is saying "Desktop" when I expect it to remember
that I changed it to "D:\"

Sometimes the desktop icon is present, other times it is absent.
I previously had downloads set to go to My Documents. Tried to change it back to
desktop today. Despite the Options panel saying that all downloads would go to
the desktop and the prefs:

browser.download.downloadDir
browser.download.dir

being set to the Desktop, downloads keep going to My Documents, presumably
because of this pref:

browser.download.defaultFolder

HACK for illustrating bug on linux

I have the same issue on linux. Should I open a new bug for this ?

From what I understand, the filefield showing the download folder is
"listening" for the browser.download.folderList preference, but I remains at
the value 2 when changing the directory. The small hack attached fixes this
problem (not meant for commit of course ;-) ).

Maybe the best way would be for the filefield to listen to the two preferences
browser.download.folderList and browser.download.dir if I am not wrong.
s/but I remains/but it remains/
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


Downloads > Download Folder directory can't be changed.
