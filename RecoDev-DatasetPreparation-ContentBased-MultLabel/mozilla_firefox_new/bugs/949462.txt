I'm not sure whether this is a result of the recent theme-ification of the variables view, or if it used to look like that, but it is very annoying. You can see in the attached screenshot that only selecting a scope makes the arrow visible. Both themes are affected, as the scope background seems to be the same.

It used to looks like that, and it definitely is pretty annoying.

Looks like there is an element with the 'arrow' class, which defines -moz-appearance: treetwisty - https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/linux/devtools/widgets.css#642.  I'm not really sure why this doesn't show up on Linux, but can you maybe try just setting a color on the element and see if it starts showing up?

It *does* show up, but the color is so similar to the scope's header background that it's practically invisible.

Looks good on osx with the patch applied.  I would like you to refactor this a bit, using the existing .theme-twisty class provided by the light and dark themes.

Panos, does this fix the issues you were seeing on Linux?

Could we just apply the 'theme-twisty' class to this object from js (in VariablesView.jsm) and only add the special margins needed using this selector: ".variables-view-container .theme-twisty"?

This would help clean up the code while still fixing the issue

The DevTools tests seem to be failing, do you know what might have happened here ?
Oh wait, I just figured it out myself. The tests check for the .arrow class.
