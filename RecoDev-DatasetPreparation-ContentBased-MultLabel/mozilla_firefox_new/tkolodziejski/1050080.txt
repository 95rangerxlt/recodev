Due to bug 771630 and bug 506446, users may have lost some of their default whitelists in the permission manager. This breaks things like UITour, LWT previews on AMO, and adds another warning for add-on and app installation. We should redo the whitelisting to help affected users who currently have broken experiences. We may want to do this soon (e.g. for the next UI Tour usage) and again once the two bugs are resolved.

This may be as simple as bumping the version number in the pref names to one in the future.

Of course this will affect users who explicitly removed the permissions but I don't see how we can detect that case. We should probably send an email to dev.platform and the enterprise mailing list to notify people if we do this.

This patch previously had f+ in bug 506446, and that bug just landed on fx-team - assuming it makes it to central, this is the last piece of the puzzle to get these defaults back.

The try from bug 506446 - https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a3a9210acc3e - included this patch.

MattN, in that other bug you mentioned:

I'm not aware of that list - are you able to send that mail (or point me at the list) once this lands?

CC'ing firefox-dev would probably be good too.
While drafting the email, I noticed default_permissions also needs the line:

host	uitour	1	about:home

Given the patch to firefox.js:
-pref("browser.uitour.whitelist.add.340", "about:home");

I don't think this is worth re-review, but if you disagree, speak now or forever hold your peace ;)

I agree but you can have r=me again regardless.
Thanks :)

Marking addon-compat in case an add-on used PermissionUtils (now removed) or needs to deal with the new behaviour for managing permissions.
Mark, any objections to backing this out for causing bug 1072744, bug 1072748, and bug 1072751? 

Will a backout cause any problems with the permissions due to the permissions prefs being cleared upon being previously imported? i.e. if the defaults are removed, do they also get lost from profiles that used this patch because the default permissions aren't stored in the database anymore? If this will cause the permissions to get lost until it re-lands then maybe we shouldn't backout fully and instead file a new bug to revert only PermissionsUtils.jsm and XPIProvider.jsm but make sure that reverting XPIProvider.jsm won't mess up desktop permissions. What do you think?

It's a shame, but no.

This shouldn't be a problem - we never removed those old defaults from the database - so if a user still had the defaults written by the pref system they should remain.

That would certainly make relanding this less of a priority and leave us with working permissions for uitour in the scenarios that caused us to take this approach in the first place.  OTOH though, if we felt these problems were solvable in the next iteration I think it would be fine to back out fully and re-land.
