Gijs, does this cover what you wanted?

This is the right idea! f+ because of the initialLocation thing... I'm pretty sure the code doesn't work as-is. Try looking at what other tests that load supporting files into tabs do... perhaps it makes sense to just add a tab for the page you're loading, and then removing that tab again?

To avoid a race condition here (what if the load event has fired before the promise is set up?), set up the promise before newEncoding.click(), and then yield it after, so:

let tabLoadPromise = promiseTabLoadEvent(gBrowser.selectedTab, TEST_PAGE);
newEncoding.click();
yield tabLoadPromise;

And the same for the similar code lower down, please. :-)

... does this work? There is no other code in MXR that uses this, as far as I can tell...

This looks good to me. Can you push this to try to verify it works everywhere and we haven't missed anything? :-)

This variable is now dead, please remove it. :-)
