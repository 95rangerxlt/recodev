Firefox/1.0RC1

In Firefox help, in several places keyboard-shortcuts are described.
In en-US help, "Cmd" and "Opt" are used. And they are used for a reason.
In fi-Fi they have been translated to "Ctrl" and "Alt". But on MacOS X, this is
incorrect. Its "Apple/Cmd" and "alt/Opt" there. 
Therefore these Key-descriptors should not be changed, to maintain the
cross-platform nature of the help.

Benoit of the fr-FR team noted that, if entities are used correctly, it should
show "Cmd" and "Opt" on Mac, "Ctrl" and "Alt" on PC.

Setting flag to get attention. AFAICT according to instructions.

The new files for help

The previous patch didn't include tabbed_browsing.xhtml and platform.dtd
because they could not be diffed as no earlier version existed (and I'm no CVS
wizard). 

Those files are in this zip. Don't apply the above patch without these files as
help will break down.


Firefox help fi-FI not translated correctly
