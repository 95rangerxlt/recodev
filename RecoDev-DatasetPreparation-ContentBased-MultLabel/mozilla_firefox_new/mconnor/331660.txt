stuart was already added in bug 330784 :)
Ah, I thought he meant stuart still hadn't been added, but he must have meant before the a1.
Here's the plan of record:

Use this bug until close to the end of b2 to track names, and then make the change.  Please suggest names in the bug as appropriate.

Spark PR is still listed as the PR agency in the credits. I believe that should be corrected to A&R Partners, or they should at least be added.

Pretty sure that should be "J. Paul Reed" instead.
shouldn't this list of people be merged with the about:credits list?
(In reply to comment #21)
> shouldn't this list of people be merged with the about:credits list?

What do you mean exactly? Are you saying that these people be put on the about:credits list, too, or something else?

about:credits != Firefox Credits

The people on the Firefox Credits page should be in about:credits, but not visa-versa.
what I mean is that I don't understand the distinction between the lists, what makes somebody being part of about:credits and what makes somebody being part of credits.xhtml. It is clear to me that Firefox wouldn't exist without the whole collaborative work of the people cited in about:credits.

Another thing is that all localizers should be in the credits list since Firefox wouldn't exist without them outside of English-speaking countries. Pike is listed in none of the lists for instance and he works full-time on Firefox.

The credits.xhtml list is pretty limited compared to the number of people that worked on Firefox at all levels, coding, theme, translation, marketing, documentation... I guess there are rules that say "about:credits list that kind of contributors" and "credits.xhtml lists that subset of the general list", but AFAIK the rules are not explained anywhere.

It is also strange to see mozillazine in the list but not spreadfirefox, nor geckozone.org nor aviary.pl nor firefox-browser.de... well, you get the idea.

That'd be an oversight, he should be there, without a doubt.

I should have cross-posted the points I made in another bug where it was proposed to kill the separate list.  Will do so as a clean comment.

Really, we need to update the supporting org list as well, I was admittedly focused in the short term on recognizing individual contributors.  More shortly on how we've been looking at this.
A bit of summary/crosspost from newsgroup and bug discussions (i.e. in the mozilla.org Governance bug):

There are two sets of people we want to thank and give credit to, especially in a large project with a broad history and hopefully broader future:

One is the total collection of everyone who has worked on the project, from the early days leading to Mozilla 1.0, to driving the webtools and other projects (Thunderbird, Sunbird, Chatzilla, etc), to shipping Firefox in different versions.  That is the sum of everyone who has made the project what it is, and what it will become in the future.

The other is the much smaller group of people who made the current release happen.  This is not just true for Firefox, but for any other Mozilla project.  We do not, as a project, do a good job of calling out individual contributions when they are making major contributions (see Axel being missing as a key example).  This is going to be an attempt to change that, by making sure that the people who are making this release happen have that contribution called out.

We think both sets are important enough to recognize, which is why we're driving this.  Please continue to nominate people for inclusion, especially anyone long-overlooked!

Just to confirm, "Yes, that's right."

Kthx. ;-)
I propose we also add Dao Gottwald to either about:credits or credits.xhtml for his help with the tabstrip.
Just a quick note we'll be wrapping the bug up shortly - so if you were going to add names now's the time :-).
Axel Hecht should be obviously added, I agree with Pascal on this.

As for the localization teams, they list themselves using the credit.translation entity in credits.dtd in each respective locale.

Will be attaching a patch which adds the following list.

This combines the old list, minus people known to have left the project, with the nominations here, as well as a list of active contributors gleaned from deep querying of Bugzilla.  Please add comments here, thanks!

This should be "J. Paul Reed", as per comment #26.
Does dbaron go by "David Baron" or "L. David Baron"?

also, what about Dao Gottwald?

Finally, for Hakan Waara (and others?), I think you are missing an umlaut
sorry, not an umlaut, but &aring;
If we are going to continue to have

Yes, thank you for noticing.
I think I'd rather take 7-zip out of the list for now, I'm not really looking to identify in this list what people did (though there's the beginning of a project to track community members and their contributions, which should allow people to find this out)

Fixed Håkan

Fixed preed (I had fixed that once, but obviously in the wrong place)

Beltzner, please do a quick pass and ensure this looks right, and that I haven't missed anything important.
There's a superfluous blank:

And my name is Dão, actually, but I don't care much.

Add names from Japan and fix order

Add names from comment #57 and fix ordering.
Since we seem to have perennial ordering problems, I decided to check the alphabetization of the current MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH credits.xhtml using (gasp!) a computer.  Lowly little /bin/sort caught the two mistakes you correct in attachment 240881 (Gao after Gansky, Sidje down to between Sicking and Smedberg), and also one other (Prescott after Ponomarev).  (That's assuming that all the names are alphabetized by the correct word within them, something that computers aren't so good at.)

So you might want to also switch Prescott and Ponomarev.

I just noticed now that my name was on the credits. One small nit though. "Ventor" should be "Ventnor". Everyone makes that mistake with my name. Can this be fixed up on the trunk credits please? :)

They also left some people out.  It would be nice to rectify that with this patch.
