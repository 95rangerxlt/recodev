add three names
Did you forget about bug 314062 and bug 268579 ?
Can you please add Ben Turner to the list as well.  He's been very helpful with end-game update service development.
May I also be added to the credits?
I'd like to be added to the about dialog in Mozilla Firefox.
I'm already in the /toolkit/content/mozilla.xhtml and
/toolkit/content/about.xhtml files but they dont seem to be the ones that
firefox uses.
I've contributed to various parts on both firefox and thunderbird:

Dan Mosedale should also be added. Rob Strong if he's not already there, too.
Going to try to finish this off tonight, and as a note, we're trying to differentiate the about:credits list and the credits mentioned here.  The idea is to highlight the people who have made substantial contributions to getting Firefox out the door.  Its really not an elitist thing, its about focusing recognition on the people without whom we could not have shipped these releases.
