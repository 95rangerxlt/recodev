-Go to Preferences | Content | Fonts & Colors
notice size the Default Font: Select object

Tested results:  The height of the object is too small to display the current
text selection. (Although the object is clickable and fonts can be selected from
the list.)

expected results: The height of the Default Font select object should be the
same as the Size : select object just to the right.

small select object in Linux Pref Content panel
*** Bug 301821 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
ok, we're missing a fallback case here where if the pref value doesn't match
something in the list, we hork, so we need to pick something if the pref value
doesn't match (using the same method we do to fall back sanely in content).
ok, so nsIFontEnumerator.getDefaultFont is basically useless (even though its
used in chrome, which I haven't bothered to track down yet) so I need an idea of
how to pick a sane default font.

jshin, is there a sane way of getting the appropriate default font based on
langgroup and font type that I can use here?  I can fix this in about 12 seconds
once I have that.
Ok, so the options are:

a) try to replicate the means to pick the fallback font, and select that
b) create a blank menuitem and select that

a) is going to be hard from JS since GetDefaultFont is not implemented.  The
fallback to b) seems likely, this is 98% cosmetic.

fixes the visual glitch by inserting a blank menuitem and selecting it

If we weren't in l10n freeze, we could add a label such as "No font selected"
or somesuch, but I'm not convinced that's valuable in general, and certainly
not worth late-l10n for.
