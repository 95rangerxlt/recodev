This isn't (wasn't?) a needed feature (see discussion in bug 983723).  We're already actively updating engines to not use it, but since the principle behind it was flawed, just removing the feature seems like the right next step.

Attached patch removes the relevant code, and adds some logging to dump if we hit a MozParam that tries to use this (or any other unknown condition).
