when I'm done with this, I should figure out why browserconfig.properties is in content in /browser, and locales in /other-licenses, because that just sucks.
bug 313712 created DNS entries for complete locale names, the patch here just
uses AB_CD, which renders to 
de.start.mozilla.com instead of de-de.start.mozilla.com.

Opening the book of e-Ville.
I don't consider this fixed1.8.
Localizers, please watch this bug before you update your locales to match this 
change.
I'm going to re-resolve this, looks like the list of DNS entries we added was kinda bogus.  Going to reopen that bug with a saner list matching the real locales.

According to bug 313712, we should be using the former, but maybe that's no longer correct.


(Should these URLs really be localizable, so that every localizer has to copy the correct value into their localization, or can we do this in a way that localizers can't break it?)
Answering #6, at least the part for homePageSingleStartMainURL could likely
be dealt with just by build foo in browserconfig.properties.
Now we're having to deal with QA for ~40 locales, and everything between using
en-us and not having it all all.
In trunk nightly build, the error occurs because there is no "homePage*" resource.

Hrm. This says that we only added those strings for release, that is,
other-licenses/branding/firefox.

I'm leaving it up to mconnor if we care about profile migration for non-release
bits, it may make testing easier.
rebron, what should happen for non-official builds?

bonecho.


Update start page URLs to new domains and make the strings localizable for real this time.
