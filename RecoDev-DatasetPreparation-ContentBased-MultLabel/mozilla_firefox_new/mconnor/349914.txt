"Recently Closed Tabs" in History will be grayed out when you close tabs after doing a "clear private data"

To recreate:
1. Open four pages in four tabs.
2. Close one of the tabs.
3. Go to Tools menu and select "Clear Private Data"
4. Close one more tab.
5. Go to History menu

Expected: History menu should have the "Recently Close Tabs" enabled, and it should allow you to select the tab you closed in step 4.

Actual: It is grayed out.

Notice that if you right click one of the tabs you do have the option to open the recently closed tab.

Reproducible: Always

This was probably caused by bug 343212 (assuming you cleared history in step 3). I think the bug is that you can use the context menu after clearing history.
Oh, nevermind, I misunderstood - you closed another tab after clearing. This might still be related to bug 343212, though.
Regression between 1.8.1b2_2006081712 and 1.8.1b2_2006081801. 
Ah, so likely a regression from bug 348016, then.
Hi Juan,

I can't reproduce this problem. I tried the latest nightlies on Mac and XP, as well as running from latest branch CVS code. Is there anything in your profile that might be different from mine? Did you test with a clean profile?
I tested on a WinXP vm, using Parallels on a Macintel, with a clean profile, and I had added this on the prefs.js file:

user_pref("browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo", 2);

Also, one thing I noticed is that after step 5, if you right click on a tab and "Undo Close Tab", and then you go to the Hisotory menu, you will not see the problem.

I will try on a different machine.
I meant to say: "...after step 4..."
--> blocking, let's get some solid STR or a WFM on this, please.
I tried on a different vm, and I was able to recreate the problem. Then I tried on an intel box with WinXP and also an intel box with Windows2000, and I was NOT able to recreate the problem.

This is a problem with my VM's.
resolving invalid, as per comment #9
reproduced in XPsp2 with Firefox 2.0 beta 2 RC1 and with nightly (2006082403).

One Note: "Recently Closed Tabs" is grey out, but what works is this "undo close tab" function, while right click on the other existing tab.

This also fixes the inverse case, which was that if there were Recently Closed Tabs before, the menuitem doesn't disable until you mouse to it.

Kinda edgy, but worth fixing.

Low risk.
seems to be checked-in only on Trunk, not yet on Branch, so not "resolved/fixed" yet.
is this a bug on Branch, not on Trunk ?

please check-in on Branch ASAP.

and how about bug 345014 ?

RESOLVED FIXED means a bug was fixed on the trunk, so this bug is FIXED. The branch checkin will happen once it gets approval.
