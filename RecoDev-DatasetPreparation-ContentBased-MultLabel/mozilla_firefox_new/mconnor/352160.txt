Screenshot showing the wrong reporter icon
Not quite sure what's going on here... mconnor checked in new images last night for this (and referenced a wrong bug number) but the images he landed don't match what LXR is showing...
For some reason chrome://reporter/skin/reporter-icon-small.png isn't small, instead it seems to be an older version of chrome://reporter/skin/reporter-icon-large.png (the borders are different) so instead of a small icon it's showning the top left corner of a large one.
waiting on RC for the small version of the image.
waiting on RC for the small version of the image.
checked the new icons from Radiant Core, this should be fixed now.
