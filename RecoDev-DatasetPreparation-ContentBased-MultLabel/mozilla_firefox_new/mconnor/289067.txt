Is this an issue now that bug 263698 is fixed? It seems to work fine for me in
recent Firefox builds in Windows (I get suggested a ".jpg" filename when
downloading the image). I'm guessing that this really isn't a Linux only issue,
as the OS field implies, since comments in bug 264757 seem to indicate otherwise.
Yeah, looks like the checkin for bug 294759 ported this fix too.


Save of images should use content-disposition and type from image cache [port fix of bug 264757 to Firefox]
