When I right-click on an image in a page that is opened in the drivers sidebar, every possible option appears on the context menu, and the following error shows up on the Error Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIScrollBoxObject.ensureElementIsVisible]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/scrollbox.xml :: ensureElementIsVisible :: line 91"  data: no]

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to http://steelgryphon.com/sidebars/mozSidebar.html
2. Bookmark the page.
3. Open the bookmark's properties dialog.
4. Check the "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" checkbox.
5. Open the bookmark; it should open in the sidebar.
6. Right-click the header image.

Note: loading the page in a regular browser window doesn't exhibit the problem; it seems specific to the sidebar.

I can reproduce consistently with both the drivers sidebar and other pages containing images (f.e. http://tmp.garyr.net/).

I see this on the branch, too.
I actually see this anywhere in a sidebar, not just on an image. mconnor suspects this might be places fallout, so I'm cc'ing him and brettw and ben.
I also get:
Error: InlineSpellCheckerUI is not defined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 4147

which is kind of confusing. InlineSpellCheckerUI is defined in the global scope, so I don't know how that works in the regular content area, but not in the sidebar.
The sidebar for web panels is in web-panels.xul, so we need to add the spellcheck js to that file as well. I have a patch, but some other bustage is still present, taking and investigating.

This is pretty minimal, there's still a bug we shipped in 1.5.0.x, which is back/forward etc don't work (there's a "this frame" menu that works, but that's bogus).
