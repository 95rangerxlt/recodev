I saw this while working on my browser-chrome test, and I think the speed with which the test was closing a tab tickled this edge case. I can't reproduce the problem with the patch applied, so I think this fixes it.

I also think this is a valid edge-case, so I don't believe this is just a band-aid to another problem.
