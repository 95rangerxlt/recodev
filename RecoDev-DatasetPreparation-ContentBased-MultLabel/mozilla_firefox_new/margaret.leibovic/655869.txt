... and the geolocation API doesn't.

STR:
1) Go to http://gavinsharp.com/tmp/geo.html
2) Select "Never Share" from the doorhanger dropdown
3) Go to http://www.gavinsharp.com/tmp/geo.html
4) Open page info, go to the "Permissions" tab

Expected: the "Share Location" row should have "Always Ask" selected (the geo prompt did show up after 3)

Actual: the "Share Location" row shows "Block", since it thinks the gavinsharp.com permission applies to www.gavinsharp.com (due to using testPermission)
