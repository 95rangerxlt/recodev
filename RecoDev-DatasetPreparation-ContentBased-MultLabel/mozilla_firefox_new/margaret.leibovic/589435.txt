The Firefox button's submenus still have the same old plain menu styling while the main menu is purdy.  i6 of the mockup shows the menus with the plain styling but I think they should be styled like the main menu for consistency sake and to add some eye candy.  Look at the screenshot and notice how ugly the submenu's look on top of the main menu.

For what it's worth, I think it would look better if we left it as it is now with the default style.

Should submenus spawned from the left pane be white and from the right pane be the bluish color, or both white?  Faaborg, shorlander?

yeah, the plan was to maintain the default style.  It doesn't mesh incredibly well with the main menu, but I think it makes sense in the context of the overall OS. I'm worried that if we create submenus unlike anywhere else on the system we'll start to feel uncanny. (we got into this situation since the normal approach of changing the contents of the panes is really inefficient for mouse distance).

I'm going to toss the question over to Stephen

here's the menu attached to the shut down button in the start menu

I propose we go with the minor style change you see in the sub-menu hanging off of the shut-down menubutton in the start menu.  It's only a minor color difference and border difference but it helps smooth out the jarring-ness of the two menu types side by side
Has there been any decision on this? Does it need to block?
Yes, it needs to block. It's all the way ugly. Needs input from Shorlander if not Faaborg.
Okay, I can take it then. I just need to know how it should look :)
Stephen: the platform doesn't really give us much to go on for combining direct sub-menus with a ribbon style main menu.  I was thinking using white backgrounds for the sub-menus created on the left side, and blue for the ones created on the right side (to further focus on the actions versus places distinction).  Did you have any other ideas?  Alternatively we could just make all of them white, since that goes with everything.

Well we certainly don't want to commit a fashion faux pas with our menus!

Coloring the menus blue or white based on which side they originate from seems like it could be rather strange to me. However without seeing it in action it is hard to say.

I will mockup a few ideas.

Matching the respective pane color

Quick mockup of sub-menus that would match the background color of the pane they are originating from.  I think this would generally work since you can only see one of them at a time, and it might potentially slightly reinforce that items on the left carry out an action while items on the right (generally) take you to a location in the UI or on the Web.

Setting -moz-appearance: none; on the menupopup gets rid of the vertical line in the menupopup, and I'm having trouble figuring out what I need to do to get that back.

I ended up using a gradient as the background to reproduce the gutter.

This draws the line behind the menu item labels on XP. It probably shouldn't be there at all on XP.

nit: padding is a little off on the left side of the checked items compared to native menus.  With that fixed we can land this for feedback.

Yeah, I was thinking that as I wrote it, but I wasn't sure of a better way to select all the submenus. In particular, there can be many levels of submenus under the Web Developer menu and the History/Bookmarks menus. Should I make different child selectors for each of the possible submenus? I feel like that could be error-prone. It would be nice if I could add a class to the menupopups, but I don't know how that would work for the dynamically generated menupopups.

All sides of the menupopup needed padding to match the native theme. I also got rid of the gutter on XP.

I'm still not sure what to do about the selector to make it more efficient :(

just discussed in person, we are going to go for hard coded colors for the vertical line as well.  On 7 the colors to match are #e2e3e3 and #ffffff

line should be 28px from the edge, and connect with the horizontal line seperators.
You probably want ThreeDLightShadow and ThreeDHighlight.

patch v2

To avoid using the descendant selector, I added an onpopupshowing handler to the popup that figures out how the popup should be styled based on its ancestors. I'm not sure if this is more efficient, but it seemed like it could be a potential solution.

I also made image files to use for the background instead of the gradients because Alex and I discovered that the gradient colors were blending into each other, preventing us from rendering the colors we wanted. I also used hard-coded color values for the aero border color because ThreeDShadow was not matching the color used for the native menu borders.

small nit: 30px in the print sub menu from the left edge to the gutter instead of 28, perhaps the icon is expanding it?

I'm doubtful, and adding that code to the toolkit binding certainly seems suboptimal to me. Let's just use the descendant selector.

This sounds like you didn't specify the color stops correctly. You'll also need to mirror it for RTL, btw.

ThreeDLightShadow is too light for the border. ThreeDShadow is closer, but it's not the same as the native menupopup borders. However, they are very similar, so for the ease of maintaining this in the future, maybe we should just use ThreeDShadow. It's up to Alex. (ThreeDShadow is #a0a0a0 and the native menu popup borders are #979797.)

patch v3

This patch uses ThreeDShadow, but I can change it back to the hard-coded value if that's what Alex wants.

I tried messing around with the gradients more, but I couldn't get the correct colors. I could get the right color to appear in the middle of a wider gradient, but it seems like gradients don't support rendering a 1px wide line of the color of your choice.
Everything else in the sub-menu is a hard coded color, so I think we should just hard code to the border as well so that we can get the native shade.

Oh, I meant the separator, not the border, when I was talking about ThreeDLightShadow.

They should, please let me see the code.

Also, I don't think you should do anything for "#appmenuPrimaryPane menupopup" on XP -- those are white already.

I tried:

background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(left, [white/#f1f5fb] 26px, ThreeDLightShadow 26px, ThreeDHighlight 27px, [white/#f1f5fb] 28px);

and

background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(left, [white/#f1f5fb] 26px, ThreeDLightShadow 27px, ThreeDHighlight 27px, [white/#f1f5fb] 28px);

In the primary pane they both made a 1px line of #f1f1f1 (ThreeDLightShadow is #e3e3e3), and in the secondary pane the highlight line picked up some of the blue from the background. I was curious about what was going on, so I experimented with making the color stops farther apart, which made the correct colors eventually appear in the middle of the gradient, but that's not helpful because we want a 1px line.

With the multiple colors, it makes 1px of ThreeDShadow and 2px of white. The reason I did this is because there is supposed to be 2px between the top and bottom of the gutter and the gray border (you can see this in the screenshot of the native menupopup). Also, because of this, I got rid of the padding: 2px; rule for aero submenus, since the extra 2px of white border creates the same effect as the padding.
