Faaborg's mockup of better split menu button gradients

One concern I have about this is that it implies that we want to change the hover style for all menuitems in the firefox button menu, which creates even more style rules to override the native defaults.

Quick fix

Same style for split and normal, and a clearer differentiation between the two parts to indicate that the main command is click-able.

This is on the right track. I think we should use a middle ground between the start menu style and the almost pure white style here. I will post a mockup.

This is my implementation of Alex's quick fix. He really wants this to make it in, so it would be sweet if we could get it reviewed soon!

this is much nicer than the quick fix, but might not be able to make 4 since if modifies the normal sub-menus like Web developer as well.

This doesn't work, and I believe it's because of the -moz-appearance: none;. It creates a solid blue background on the menu.

Oops, just noticed this was pre-approved by beltzner.

So the background color is otherwise present but hidden by the opaque gradient. Can you fix that?
