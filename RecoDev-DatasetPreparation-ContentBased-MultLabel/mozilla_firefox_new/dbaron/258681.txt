OK, I have messed around with the updated stylesheet switcher and I think I have
found a (potential) bug.

Lets say you are a new user: 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a site with multiple stylesheets. (Like http://www.w3.org/Style/)
2. You see the AltSS icon in the statusbar, mess with it, appear amazed, and
browse away from the site with “No Style” set.
3. You go to a site with only one stylesheet (Like http://www.espn.com/) and the
AltSS icon does not appear.

Actual Results:  
With “No Style” set, the site appears to be messed up.
This will frustrate new users.

Expected Results:  
From the new user's standpoint: the website should look normal.

Because the AltSS icon does not appear on sites with only one stylesheet, the
average user will not know how to fix it using the menubar option (arguably, the
icon is more visible to the user than the menubar option). Considering that most
users don’t even know what stylesheets are, user troubleshooting is also
extremely difficult.

Solutions:
1) Remove the “No Style” menuitem from the AltSS icon menupopup. You can still
disable stylesheets via the menubar. If the user disables through the menu,
he/she can realistically recover from the above scenario. -> I like this best,
it is easiest to implement and least confusing to the average user.
2) Change “No Style” for the AltSS toolbar icon to be a temporary/site-only
setting to match the non-persistent nature of the listed alternate stylesheets
-> May have a localization impact, but this is more intuitive than the current
setup.
3) Show AltSS icon on all sites with a stylesheet. -> Not very (new) user friendly.

What about:
4) If the user has set his browser in "no style" mode, show the icon. Show
nothing otherwise.

I'm not sure why this is happening though, since bug #83663 is not fixed.
Since I was asked: Benoit's (4) seems smartest. (Detail: The icon shouldn't 
then disappear immediately when another option is chosen. The menu should 
remain until the next "site", using the usual same-suite-of-style-sheets 
definition of "site" as is usually used for style sheet choice persistence.)
Bug 83663 is about persistence for the same website, not the persistence of your
"No Style" selection between different pages. I'll check out the bug and the
possibilities that exist to resolve it, but please don't do anything silly like
assigning it to me in the meantime.
I agree 4 is a possible solution. The problem with this solution is it is
inconsistent and it may make more sense just to always show the icon (solution
3), not just show it if No Style is enabled.

I am still pretty sure that solution 1 is the best way. Currently there is no
indication to the user that the selection of No Style will persist across other
sites, as selecting an alternative stylesheet does not persist across multiple
sites (it really can't) or even for that site (Bug 83663 will fix this). This
approach does not remove any functionality or accessibility, as all the options
are accessible through the menu (this maintains keyboard accessibility as well).
The only problem I can see, however, is what happens when you globally disable
stylesheets and visit a site with alternate stylesheets. The icon should appear
as expected (maybe have an icon with an X through it for visual acknowledgement
that stylesheets are disabled) and the user can still select a stylesheet if
he/she desires or not click on the icon and leave page styles globally disabled.
Obviously, selecting a stylesheet will reenable stylesheets.

I am by no means an expert in web standards/programming and I apologize if I
have overstepped my boundaries, I am just trying my best to help.
The "No Style" option persists the same way Text Zoom does. You can't apply a
"is the style sheet still there" check for it because it also affects pages
without a style sheet.

83663 is not going to be fixed on the branch. It has dependencies on some Gecko
API changes that Boris is working on, and it will require significant C++ work.

mpt: we don't have a concept of "site" to work with here. We can keep the icon
until the next page load, however. Note also that this will degrade the icon's
reliability as a "this page has alternate style sheets" indicator, and that the
"keep it there while No Style is selected" option will trigger even if No Style
were selected from the menus.

I'm leaning towards (1).
I prefer option 1. As I wrote at mozillaZine
(http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=777285), it even makes logical
sense... which is novel.

To improve the icon reliability, it could be different when "No style" is
selected (the same icon with a red strike on it for example). It would remember
the user any time that *something* is disabled and that's why the page may look
strange.

I too would suggest using solution (1) for now, since I assume (4) + icon change
is too much work to be done before the PR, and I'd really hate to see the
styleswitcher going away again for that. But (4) + new icon could be retained as
a better solution for later (Firefox 1.1 or something).
The UI will probably be more thorougly revisited at a later date. Today's build
is now out, I'll make a patch momentarily.

Hides "No Style" and separator on AltSS icon popup

Simply adds hidden="true" to the "No Style" menuitem and then checks for this
when deciding the seperator status.

Requesting review so we can get this out of the way and move on.

Hides "No Style" and separator on AltSS icon popup

Why not just remove the "No Style" and separator code?	It will still be in CVS
if you want it back.
dbaron testing now.
