This doesn't block, but would take fix.
Was there a change in the appearance of the UI in question?  I'd expect there would be...

format the code more legibly (no code changes)

I've used this approach before for formatting markup that couldn't have whitespace in it -- I think it's a bit saner than all-on-one-line.

This removes the span -- I'm not sure why it was there, and things lay out the way they used to once I remove it.  This fixes the bug.

I've added that span to work-around bug 349477, which is fixed now.

"Warning: XUL box for hbox element contained an inline span child" on preview



Format the XUL-on-one-line more legibly.  b=401820  r=mano  a1.9=beltzner 

Remove the span causing the warning and incorrect alignment.  b=401820  r=mano  a1.9=beltzner
