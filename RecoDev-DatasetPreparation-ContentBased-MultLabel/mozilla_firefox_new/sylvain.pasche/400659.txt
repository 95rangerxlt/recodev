Steps to reproduce:

1. Open places organizer
2. Select a bookmark, click "More"
3. enter something in the description
4. Select another bookmark in the tree
5. Come back to the bookmark you edited
6. See how the description was not saved

The description field has multiline=true, which apparently makes the element an instance of HTMLTextAreaElement.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
