After customizing the toolbars, the bookmarks toolbar overflow menu is empty and
overlaps with the last bookmark on the bar. This did not occur on yesterday's
(2004-07-06) nightly.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add enough bookmarks to show overflow menu on bookmarks toolbar.
2. Goto View->Toolbars->Customize
3. Click Done in the Customize window

Commenting out the browser.js changes from Bug 221482 prevents the problem
happening.

Resizing the window fixes it (commenting out the browser.js changes just gives
you a blank personal toolbar, no?).. I'm not sure how to force a reflow of the
toolbar widget, but will figure it out

With the changes commented out after clicking Restore Default Set the toolbar is
blank again (big suprise :-). If you don't click Restore then the bookmarks
still display but their properties can't be accessed anymore after closing the
customize panel.

This ought to take care of it.

Please add a comment indicating why you need to do that.  That line is the sort
of thing that will baffle us in 8 months.  With that, r=shaver for aviary
insertion.
fix in on aviary.
Thanks, confirming it works again on:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040708 Firefox/0.9.0+

All these customize bugs have been marked fixed but doesn't the Trunk need the
patches as well first?
