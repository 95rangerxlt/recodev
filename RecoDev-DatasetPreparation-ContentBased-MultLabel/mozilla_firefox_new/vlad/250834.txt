Here's another that fails 
http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/nfl/news

I verified that this feed is valid at feedvalidator.org.  When trying to look at
the livemark entries it says live bookmark feed failed to load.

And this seems to go for all of the espn feeds.  I tried a few of them.

I'm not sure if this should be a separate bug though because these feeds are RSS
2.0.

This make us prefer urls obtained from guid's over those from links. This is
alleged to be the intent of the spec.

This should fix http://kottke.org/index.xml, the blogs.sun.com feeds, and a few
others.

A comment on this patch: if isPermaLink is set to false, the value of linkStr
will be false.  A new nsAutoString should be used instead.

Upon closer inspection, a new nsAutoString by the name of isPermaLink is
declared.   The second parameter on the GetAttribute call on the next line
should make use of this variable.

Some minor changes, but please also make a patch against aviary -- browser/*
isn't quite in sync with trunk, and there's other platform differences between
trunk and branch.  Since firefox is shipping off aviary, that's where this
should go..

EqualsLiteral doesn't exist on aviary/1.7 branch.

Thanks. I hadn't realized that EqualsLiteral wasn't on branch. This patch drops
the new string stuff and fixes my silly isPermaLink typo and is rediffed
against branch.

I've checked that it applies fine to both trunk and branch versions of
nsBookmarksFeedHandler.cpp. And that it builds and works on trunk. However, I
don't have a branch build handy right now and can't check right away that it
builds there. Hopefully things should be fine there too, but it would be really
nice if someone could confirm.
(In reply to comment #10)

Two more comments (1):

  if (!isAtom && linkStr.IsEmpty()) { 
    // in node's TEXT
  } else { 
    // in HREF attribute
  }

Should really be:

  if (isAtom) {
    // in HREF attribute
  } else if (linkStr.IsEmpty()) { 
    // in node's TEXT
  }

A test case that would fail without this change would be:

  <guid>x</guid> <link>y</link> <title>z</title>

A second problem is that you only want rel="alternate" links in Atom.

  nsAutoString rel;
  linkElem->GetAttribute(NS_LITERAL_STRING("rel"), rel);
  if (!isPermaLink.EqualsLiteral("alternate")) continue;

Cool, I'll test on the branch and will + after the build.  Thanks!

So "rel" in Atom is a single keyword, not a space-separated list of keywords 
like in HTML?

As of the current drafts of Atom, yes, "rel" in Atom is a single keyword.
Does that get us the final atom:link, or the first, in

<atom:entry>
 <atom:link rel="alternate" type="text/plain" href="/2004/09/foo.txt"/>
 <atom:link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="/2004/09/foo.html"/>
 <atom:link rel="alternate" type="application/xhtml+xml" href="/2004/09/foo.xhtml"/>
 <atom:link rel="alternate" type="application/pdf" href="/2004/09/foo.pdf"/>
</atom:entry>
Is this bug report also for Thunderbird? I guess the feed interpreter is the same?

All of their feeds work fine for me in Firefox PR1; they need to be added
manually through the bookmarks manager as they don't use <link>, but they parse
fine.
Landed on aviary.  Thanks Harshal!

Resolving this bug; the majority of the issues were with the Atom rel bits that
the patch fixed.  Please file new bugs for other unparsable valid feeds.

Is that on a nightly that it works fine or on the original 1.0PR? None of them
can be parsed, nor in FF 1.0PR nor in TB 0.8.

It works fine in both ffox 1.0PR and in a nightly.  I haven't tested
thunderbird.  Note that firefox and thunderbird do not share the same feed
parsing code; tbird's is probably somewhat more robust, even.   I'm curious to
see if someone else can reproduce these feeds not parsing, or if its something
local to your setup.

Which ones?  4-5 that I tried all worked fine.  Please file a new bug with
specific feeds that don't load.  (This is all in firefox -- tbird's RSS features
have nothing to do with firefox's.)
Didn't try the suprnova feeds, then? They have a <title> and an <enclosure>
which links to a redirector to a .torrent, but no <link> or <guid>. Do you
actually want an enhancement bug to support enclosures? (And, it looks like the
feeds don't work anyway, because suprnova sniffs for a local referrer to stop
people doing things like that.)

Heh, nope, I tried the scanned advertisement ones and a few of the uspto ones. 
No plans to support <enclosure>, so the suprnova ones will stay broken then :)

Well, some news. Found out that yesterday the Reuters feeds started working, but
today they don't work anymore. The catch? Proxy. The Reuters feeds do not work
through a proxy, but work fine with a direct internet connection!

As near as I can tell, none of the feeds mentioned on this bug report are Atom
feeds.
Can you check to see if my blog's feeds were fixed by this patch?

http://www.thenetdragon.net/blog/
My blog's live bookmark and atom feeds now work with the latest Aviary build
from Daa. The feeds for all the ESPN.com's sites now work, too. Thanks :-)

Test run on - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3)
Gecko/20041019 Firefox/1.0

I guess we are waiting till it's on the trunk to mark it verified?
I'm getting this error (as are other users) for the BBC live bookmark that comes
"embedded" in Firefox. You click on "Latest Headlines" on the live bookmark
toolbar and the only listing is the "Live bookmark feed failed to load" error
message. Not resolved after restarting Firefox and/or rebooting machine.

I think this should be reopened.
The problem there is that pre-1.0 versions had fxfeeds.mozillazine.org, not
fxfeeds.mozilla.org, and the MZ redirect is offline.  We can't dynamically
update bookmarks, but in any case that's a separate issue.  Edit the live
bookmark to the correct host and you'll be fine.

fxfeeds.mozillazine.org is now CNAME'd to fxfeeds.mozilla.org, so it should work
without the host needing to be changed in the bookmark.

Some links from http://planet.mozilla.org/rss20.xml don't work. Doesn't this
patch assume that any guid elements without a permalink attribute are
permalinks, shouldn't it assume the opposite? See for example the MozillaZine
items in the previously mentioned feed.
It does, and correctly ("isPermaLink is optional, its default value is true").
