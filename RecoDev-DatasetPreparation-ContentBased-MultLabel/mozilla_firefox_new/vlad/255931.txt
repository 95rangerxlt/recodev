a=ben@mozilla.org
in branch/trunk.
It looks like your changes to nsBookmarksService::UpdateBookmarkIcon also fixes
the issue of the wrong MIME type being saved in bookmarks.html (eg, text/plain).
See: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174265#c85

Not sure if a seperate bug on the issue was filed elsewhere. Will try to verify
this soon.
With todays builds, I can verify the issue I mentioned previously is now fixed.
When we receive a BMP icon sent as text/plain, it is now listed in the bookmarks
store with the proper type, image/x-icon.

However, I noticed a seperate issue while testing this. When I initially
bookmark a page, the icon isn't saved. Only after first loading the bookmark is
the ICON= attribute added. If we're bookmarking a page that's currently
displayed, the icon data should be available for saving in the initial bookmarks
update. (and if not, refetech it).

For the trunk, it'd have been better to use 
AppendLiteral and AppendASCII in place of '+= NS_LITERAL_STRING' and '+=
NS_ConvertASCIItoUTF16'. 

For the branch, 'dataUri += NS_ConvertASCIItoUTF16(,)' should have been
replaced by 'AppendASCIItoUTF16(icondDataBase64)'.

  I meant 'AppendASCIItoUTF16(icondDataBase64, dataUri);' (note PL_base64Encode
? returns a null-terminated string, which is why you don't need to calculate
'len'). The same is true of aMimeType. 



sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


favicons should validate content type before saving data
