In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the same directory (perhaps with "_perwindowpb" appended to its file name), and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.  Note that the original test should only be added to the list of test files in Makefile.in ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING, and the new test file should be added to the list with the reverse condition.

Sorry about the delay. Please run this through try to make sure it won't break mobile.
My account was disabled, I added a bug 825019 for that. I'll wait for the bug to run it on try.
Pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=982751ec803a
