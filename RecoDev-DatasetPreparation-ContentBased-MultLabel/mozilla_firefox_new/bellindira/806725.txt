In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the same directory (perhaps with "_perwindowpb" appended to its file name), and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.  Note that the original test should only be added to the list of test files in Makefile.in ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING, and the new test file should be added to the list with the reverse condition.

Ported testcase

The test is ported however it looks like localStorage works different on private browsing per window than on previous private browsing mode. Because once a new private browsing window is opened and closed, it is not possible to get the values of previous saved items in a normal window. As you will see when running this test, it will throw this error:

113 ERROR TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/chrome/dom/tests/mochitest/localstorage/test_localStorageBasePrivateBrowsing_perwindowpb.html | back in normal mode - got null, expected persistent1
make: *** [mochitest-chrome] Error 1

Please let me know what I should do on this check.

Thanks
That seems wrong.  Josh is looking into this.
