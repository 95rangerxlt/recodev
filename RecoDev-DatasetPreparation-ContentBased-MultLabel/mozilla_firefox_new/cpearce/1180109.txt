Patch: Add telemetry to Firefox to detect when Windows Media Foundation broken

Add telemetry to report soon after startup whether Windows Media Foundation is functional on Win Vista and later. We use WMF for decoding H.264/AAC videos for the <video> element on Windows Vista and later, and we suspect that for some proportion of our users, it's either been broken by apps like Codec Tweak Tool, or the user has not installed it yet (Enterprise N and KN versions of Windows, Vista without the Platform Update Supplement service pack).

This patch enables us to figure out how big the problem is.

r? dolske for the Firefox change.
r? vladan for opt-out Telemetry.

Using |navigator| is a bit gross (and might be wrong if overridden, although I'm not sure if that applies to chrome windows). In any case, better to check as:

if (parseFloat(Services.sysinfo.getProperty("version")) > 6) { ... }

or if you want to be new and fancy about it:

if (AppConstants.isPlatformAndVersionAtLeast("win", "6")) { ... } 

(Feel free to keep the isVistaOrLater var, I find that generally helps with readability / understanding.)
Oh, belated thought: telemetry.mo can do filtering by platform and version, so you might consider collecting this everywhere, and looking at just Vista+ by filtering the reports. But fine either way.

Collecting everywhere sounds like a great idea.

Add telemetry to report when WMF is broken and thus <video> won't work on Windows
