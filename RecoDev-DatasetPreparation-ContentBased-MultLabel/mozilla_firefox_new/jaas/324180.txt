Would this take into account bug 288322  ?
It will not handle 288322. Please read the comment listed in the summary for this bug if you want to know how the new system works. We will handle the issue in 288322 later.

Adding these nodes doesn't have any noticeable impact when Carbon widgets are in use, right?

We don't have &hellip; available to us here, but maybe we should.  Map it to "&#x2026;" on the Mac and other platforms where it's the right thing to do, and "..." elsewhere.  I'm thinking that the three periods might negatively imapct external a10y tools.  That would be another bug, this is fine for now.

Any reason why you switched from preferencesCmdMac to openMacPreferences?  You didn't do this below.

Please use matching prefixes for these and the ones below, although I'm wondering why we're making the commandkey/modifier localizable in the first place (isn't it command-, in all languages? command keys generally shouldn't be localizable).

>+<!ENTITY quitApplicationCmdMac.label    "Quit">

please use "accesskey", various automated l10n tools use special .accesskey semantics to make sure the accesskey matches something in the label (or is this a commandkey?... the entity should make that clear.

BTW - this application menu system is fully backwards-compatible with Carbon widgets. We only really need to look out for certain DOM node IDs, which have been preserved in cases where they did exist and in cases where we are just adding DOM nodes, it doesn't matter what they are called.

I'm not convinced these shouldn't be in toolkit or somewhere non-app-specific, but that's really a followup  (base toolkit menu stuff for Mac)
fixed on trunk
Is the other bug going onto the 1.8.1 branch? if not, this needs to be refactored with some #ifndef MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH love.  Should have thought of that earlier....

Looking at the patch, the IDs of About/Preferences menuitem have not been changed, so this shouldn't be an issue.
Comment on attachment 209735
fix v1.1

Really, this should be either an INC or an overlay in toolkit/content.
OK, I'm reaching here... I don't suppose anything in these changes affect Carbon builds, do they? Something checked in around 20060201-20060202 caused trunk bug 325859, which does affect the Application menu, and I'm short on potential culprits ;)
Wayne - I'm pretty sure the patch for this bug did that. I know what is wrong, I'll fix it.

Comment on attachment 209735
fix v1.1

This:

+<!ENTITY hideOtherAppsCmdMac.label      "Hide Others">
+<!ENTITY hideOtherAppsCmdMac.commandkey "H">
+<!ENTITY hideOtherAppsCmdMac.modifiers  "accel,shift">

sets the command keys to Cmd+Shift+H. While doing Polish l10n for this bug our Mac guru has pointed to me that this shortcut should be Cmd+Alt+H, as it is in Safari, Finder and other native Mac apps...

fix v1.1

So, can this changeset get wrapped in #ifndef MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH preprocessor bits, so as make it explicit what is and isn't going to do anything on the branch?
