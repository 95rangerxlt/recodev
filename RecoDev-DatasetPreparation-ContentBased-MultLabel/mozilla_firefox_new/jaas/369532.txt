Copy and Paste does not work between Firefox and OS X' PDF save dialogue using the keyboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mark a text on any Web site and copy it (Apple-C);
2. Print Web site (Apple-P);
3. Save as PDF;
4. Try to enter the copied text as filename (Apple-V).
Actual Results:  
Entering the copied text by using Apple-V does not work, however, it can be entered by using the mouse and the context menu,

Expected Results:  
Entering the copied text by using Apple-V should be possible.

With Safari, you get the expected result, i.e. you can copy and paste a text and enter it as PDF file name by using the keyboard (Apple-C, Apple-V).

I can confirm every detail,
I too can verify this issue on two clean machines. Unable to paste via keyboard shortcut in the save as PDF dialog.

This bug is still present in:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
I too can confirm this bug is still in firefox 2.0 for OS X, but with a slight difference, it doesn't paste in any program.

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
Yes, the fault is still there with FireFox 2.0.0.6 under MacOS 10.4.10
Confirming this on trunk - I see this using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007092804 Minefield/3.0a9pre.
It works fine for the latest 1.8 branch build like Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13pre) Gecko/20080223 BonEcho/2.0.0.13pre ID:2008022303

It is still broken on Trunk. Asking for blocking. I'm sure it won't be a blocker but it would be great to have it in the wanted-firefox3 list? It's a regression which bothers the user.
Josh, could this bug be related in any way to bug 417108? It still longer exists.

*** Bug 417909 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Select All (Apple-A) doesn't work either, which often bothers me.  Also, I don't think bug 417108 is closely related since it was supposedly fixed in Beta 4, but this bug is still valid in Beta 5.
I cannot see it anymore with a current nightly build e.g. Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008040604 Minefield/3.0pre ID:2008040604

Tom please download and run such a build. There was a checkin lately (after beta5) which resolved a lot of keyboard issues.

Looks like you're right...I tried the 2008-04-09 build and it looks like it all works!  Guess it's fixed...
Josh, is this bug fixed by your patch on bug 398514?
I think bug 372571 probably fixed this.
Looks like. Marking fixed by the patch on bug 372571.
