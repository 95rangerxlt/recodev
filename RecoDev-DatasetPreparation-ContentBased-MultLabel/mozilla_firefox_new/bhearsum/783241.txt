add preview.png to removed-files.in

bug 753618 removed preview.png from the default theme from the package but didn't add it to removed-files.in. This ends up showing up as a warning in our update verification tests, because it exists in an older firefox that has been updated to the latest beta, but not in the latest beta's installer.

Unless there's a reason we want this it to exist for updated users only, we should add it there.

I'd like to land this on Aurora and Beta. This patch will cause updates to 15 to remove extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}/preview.png at update time, which will make them consistent with the Firefox 15.0 installer. I don't think there's any risk to us taking this.

Looks like a simple clean up, thanks for doing this. Approving for Aurora, but not Beta since we're too close to the end of cycle there.
