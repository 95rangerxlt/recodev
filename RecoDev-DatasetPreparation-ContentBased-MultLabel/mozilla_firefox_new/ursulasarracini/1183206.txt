This includes (but isn't limited to) the following:

1) Removing #ifdef or other pre-processor directives
2) Using window.postMessage instead of RemotePageManager for message passing.
3) Add message passing or find alternatives for Firefox-specific APIs used such as Services.jsm

There's a lot of e10s work (i.e. bug 1021654) going on with about:newtab, you folks should coordinate.

We are co-ordinating with Ursula and Mike who are currently involved in bug 1021654 and I'm personally following that bug closely.

Everything in this bug is being built on top of bug 1021654.

Let's include converting to promise messages and re-organizing js files as part of this bug.

We agreed on 3 subdirs of js:

./js/page (UI)
./js/backend (Service worker)
./js/lib (external libraries, tools, helper functions)
