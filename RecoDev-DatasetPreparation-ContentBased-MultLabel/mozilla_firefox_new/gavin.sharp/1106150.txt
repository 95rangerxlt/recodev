I forgot a spot where we check the defaultenginename in bug 1102416's patch.

Thankfully, this only affects MozParams for the condition "defaultEngine", which we no longer use after bug 1103216.

So far I've failed to work out how to do this - as the function uses getDefaultBranch(), manually setting the default pref before the test doesn't have the desired effect.  If I try and set the pref using the default branch, something breaks in the pref service when run under xpcshell - subsequent gets of the value return NS_ERROR_MALFORMED_URI (sp?).  I didn't dig too deep here though, so maybe that's somewhat shallow.
