There's code in browser-syncui's _loginFailed that checks service.ready before referencing Weave.Status, to try to avoid importing some Sync modules on startup.

However, the code in _needsSetup references Weave.Status unconditionally, so those modules get loaded anyways (_needsSetup and _loginFailed are both called by updateUI, which is called on window open via initUI).

The patch in bug 966342 that checked the user state also avoided initializing the service if it wasn't already, by checking service.ready before referencing Weave.Service.identity._signedInUser. But we can access _signedInUser via Weave.Status._authManager instead (which we are loading anyways), to avoid the issue of the menu being incorrect before Sync is initialized.

 * don't try to avoid loading Weave.Status modules on window open 
 * access the authManager via Weave.Status instead of Weave.Service, since Weave.Status will already be initialized in almost all cases.

attempt to avoid initializing Weave.Status from under updateUI doesn't work



Bug 982893: give up on not trying to initialize Weave.Status on window open, since we were failing at it anyways, r=markh
