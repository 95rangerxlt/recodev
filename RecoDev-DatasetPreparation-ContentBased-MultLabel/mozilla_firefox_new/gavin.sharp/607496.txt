- the patch for bug 596731 re-added some code that uncollapses the button, which isn't necessary now that we never collapse it
- the code prior to bug 578967 was confusing, in that the click handler relied on an attribute being set on the button. Maybe because we used the "feed" attribute for styling? Either way, unnecessary now.

Looks good to me. It's nice to get rid of that attribute if we don't need it.

While you're cleaning up, you could just make the if-block return, and drop / de-indent the else-block.

But I don't care either way. :)
