Hitting Enter in the searchbar w/o input shouldn't add an empty entry to its
autocomplete.

STR:
 1. Focus the search bar.
 2. Make sure it's empty.
 3. Hit Enter

-> empty string is added to searchbar's autocomplete.

FYI, at this point, we're opening the search engine site instead of doing a query.
