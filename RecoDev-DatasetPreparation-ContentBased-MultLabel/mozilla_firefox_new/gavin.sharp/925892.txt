Currently search bar searches cannot easily be distinguished from the others, apart from "lack of a 'channel' param". It would be better for that to be more explicit.

Sorry about changing my mind but after seeing that FHR is already using "searchbar" and it's also the id of the binding I guess we should be consistent. r=me with the change.

While reviewing this patch, I found that the command line search argument is a remaining getSubmission call without a purpose argument. I filed bug 925967 to add a purpose and start warning when one is missing.
I don't think it makes sense to send the extra seven characters on billions of requests to be consistent with our internal code.  =sb is what we should use in this case, unless Google says otherwise.

"sb" is what gets sent in the URL. The internal purpose argument maps to a value provided by the search engine. See the snippet in comment 2.
Joanne, can you confirm that we're clear to make this change on Nightly (i.e. that it won't cause any trouble on Google's end)?
I have shared the information with Google and just waiting for confirmation that this will not be an issue on their end.  Thanks, Joanne
Hi Gavin, Google's technical team has confirmed the channel "sb".  Once you have a timeline that I can share with them, could you let me know?  Thanks, Joanne
