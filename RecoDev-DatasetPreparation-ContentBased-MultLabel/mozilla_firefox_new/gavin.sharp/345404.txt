I thought that _updateInterval was set unconditionally in the _parseAs functions, but it's only set in _parseAsOpenSearch if the engine description file has an UpdateInterval element, which leads to the error. This moves the fallback back into _scheduleNextUpdate and handles engines with no specified interval. Also, this makes sure we don't save update-specific information if the engine has no update URLs (which could potentially slow down startup), so that we don't even get into this situation if the engine doesn't have an update URL.
