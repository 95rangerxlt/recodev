Should that be --disable-safe-browsing?

We shouldn't be defaulting safe-browsing on for all apps... the default should be changed only for firefox by changing the default in the browser) section. I'm inclined to leave the enable/disable code alone (don't rename the flag).

I don't know what the status of 181 is, but this is the right fix on trunk and branch. I'm only doing build-config review here... somebody else is in charge of actually making the decision that safebrowsing should be turned on by default.
Checked in on the branch for a2, with a=schrep/beltzner. Will backout if it causes Ts/Tp issues.
mozilla/configure.in 	1.1503.2.64
Backed out this change since it caused large Ts and Tp increases on the branch (~21% Ts, ~9% Tp on pacifica).
Retargetted at beta 1
This also caused jumps by about a factor of 2 in both Rlk and Lk on balsa.  Are there bugs filed to track the leak and perf issues?
We're going to try to get SafeBrowsing in for Bon Echo Alpha 3, re-targeting.
Removing from a2 tracking bug
Can this please be enabled for the trunk beforehand? So you guys don't have to hold up a release again to work out the bugs. I thought that's how things were supposed to work anyways...land big things on trunk, let bake and work out bugs, land on branch? I'm saying this because I see in the today's status meeting this is supposed to land the day before branch freeze for Alpha 3 and release the following day after the freeze.

Sorry for the spam.

I was referring to attachment 221458 (sorry for the spam!)
This was fixed on trunk 2006-05-19 13:29 and on 1.8 branch 2006-05-19 15:55.

I don't know if there's something missing though. The Safe Browsing tab is present in Options-Advanced and shows that browser.safebrowsing.enabled is true, but the test page isn't reported as phishy:

Doesn't work for anyone. Regis on the forums says that he created a debug build and some files were missing. Adding these files made safebrowsing work and I can confirm. New bug?
