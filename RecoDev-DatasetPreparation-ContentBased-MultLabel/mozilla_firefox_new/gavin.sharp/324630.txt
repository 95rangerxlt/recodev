chrome calling content getters (page info -> forms) - at least java trouble

selecting "page info" -> "forms" causes chrome to call content's js getters
on input.value.

this is exploitable for at least creating local files via java on linux.

testcases to follow.

creating local files

dveditz, can you repoduce?
there seems memory corruption triggered by a side effect of this bug
(at least on linux)

seems X11/graphics related so eventually chrome may not be needed.


if someone else confirm the next attachment will file another bug.

chrome5.html - memory corruption on linux
timeless: can you please confirm or deny any of the testcases in this bug
i'm still not around , but i suspect alert Components . classes would fail...

but yeah , i'd rather not let a website know when chrome is inspecting it...
for the crash filed bug 325236.

don't claim that Components.classes works, but java seems nasty enough.

the same effect may be achieved via xbl getter.
this seems fixed by bug Bug 325236
Fixed by patch for bug 325236.
