All dialogs called with the permissions.xul file have a wrong behaviour with the Enter key. This bug is not the same as bug 324187.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Preference/Options window
2. Click on any of the "Exceptions" buttons (in Content or Security)
3. Set the focus to the text field, type nothing and press Enter

Actual Results:  
Actual results: 'scheme:http' appears in the list

Expected Results:  
Expected: nothing happens

This behaviour also appears in Firefox 2.0 beta2

(I suggest a simple test with textbox.value in http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/components/preferences/permissions.js#105 for instance)

Confirming on the latest bonecho/2.0b2 win xp nightly.

I don't see it cause any harm. Although Enter should just close the window I assume.
Regression between 1.8b2_2005060806 and 1.8b2_2005060906:

Maybe caused by Bug 296865.

Makes it act like a button press, by not explicitly calling addPermission, to let the existing input validating code do its job.

Pressing Enter in an exceptions dialog adds an unwanted 'scheme:http' entry in the list
