Adding Gavin, as he touched this last, but not sure what could have happened in the past few days to make this go away.

(Also adding Jono, in case this was one of the prefs that Test Pilot might have overwritten)
Happens on XP and Mac as well.

This needs to unregisterNotification in the success case, otherwise it will likely interfere with other tests.

Test that does not crash / timeout when it fails with observer unregister patch v0.2 [Checked in: Comment 12]

Changes since v0.1:
* Unregister observer in success case;
* Use "this" instead of "listener" in ProgressListener removal.
