A long time ago in bug 364297 I added the ability to maintain previous default prefs for existing users, so that we could switch the default home page for new users without affecting existing users. We only made use of this on the 2.0 upgrade (in fact we had to get rid of the files immediately to avoid breaking people in 2.0.0.3, bug 380429), and haven't used it since (AFAIK). We should rip out the code to simplify things (and avoid an extra stat() on upgrade startups :).

patch

All of this code basically only kicked in if we shipped an existing-profile-defaults.js file, and we haven't done that since bug 380429.
Is this patch landable? (I mean, if I unbitrot it)
It was on top of bug 699573's patch in my queue, and I never got around to addressing the issues with that patch. If you want to remove that dependency and un-bitrot this patch, that'd be great!
