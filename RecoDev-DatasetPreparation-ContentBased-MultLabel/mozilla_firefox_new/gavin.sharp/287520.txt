When you change manually the selected search engine, the property
browser.search.selectedEngine is changed and added in prefs.js (change can be
watched with about:config too).

But if you add for example in user.js:

user_pref("browser.search.selectedEngine", "Yahoo");

it won't select Yahoo.

At the moment, you can change the the selected engine in the file localstore.rdf
(in the profile folder too).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open user.js in your profile folder (create it if it doesn't exist)
2.add user_pref("browser.search.selectedEngine", "Yahoo");
3.Shutdown and reload Firefox

Actual Results:  
he selected engine remains to what it was

Expected Results:  
it should select the engine written.

I get the same thing with the trunk nightlies, specifically:

This is an automated message, with ID "auto-resolve01".

This bug has had no comments for a long time. Statistically, we have found that
bug reports that have not been confirmed by a second user after three months are
highly unlikely to be the source of a fix to the code.

While your input is very important to us, our resources are limited and so we
are asking for your help in focussing our efforts. If you can still reproduce
this problem in the latest version of the product (see below for how to obtain a
copy) or, for feature requests, if it's not present in the latest version and
you still believe we should implement it, please visit the URL of this bug
(given at the top of this mail) and add a comment to that effect, giving more
reproduction information if you have it.

If it is not a problem any longer, you need take no action. If this bug is not
changed in any way in the next two weeks, it will be automatically resolved.
Thank you for your help in this matter.

I can confirm this bug in 1.5 Beta 1 for Windows. Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U;

My user.js contains:
user_pref("browser.search.selectedEngine", "Google");

I select eBay and exit. When I restart, eBay is still selected.
This is a INVALID request as we don't expect users will change
that pref manually.

If I were a owner or a peer, I'd like to mark this as WONTFIX.
This should actually work now, given that I changed how the search bar initializes the selected engine on launch in bug 235204. The pref isn't live though (the observer was removed with attachment 194958 to fix bug 306135), so you need a restart for it to take effect. If it doesn't, go ahead and reopen.
That being said, if this didn't work then this is probably WONTFIX as Torisugari mentioned.


changing browser.search.selectedEngine in user.js doesn't take effect
