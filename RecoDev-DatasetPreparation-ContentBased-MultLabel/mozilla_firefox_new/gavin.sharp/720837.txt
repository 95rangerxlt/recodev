bug 717106 talks about using a different wordmark for the upcoming ESR release, and possibly other branding changes like the display name. We need to put these changes somewhere and make sure the release uses them.

If we use a separate branding directory it would be great to update the release mozconfigs to set it properly when MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL is esr. browser/config/mozconfigs{linux32,linux64,macosx64,win32}/release are the files in question.

What obstacles prevent a wordmark being in SVG format instead of PNG?

I suggest tracking this elsewhere. This bug is specifically about branding changes for the ESR, and needs to be completed in short order.
Here is the wordmark as a PNG: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=591271&action=edit
So the only difference we want between this build and Firefox 10 is the different wordmark in the about dialog?
I think Laura and/or Kev want something in the title bar, too. I'm not 100% sure about that though.

1)we want to change the wordmark in the about:dialogue. 
2) Update the dialogue so it says "You are currently on the Firefox ESR update channel"
3) Update the description in the about dialogue to say: 
"Firefox ESR is intended for groups who deploy and maintain the desktop environment in large organizations such as universities and other schools, county or city governments and businesses."
4) I want to make sure when people install the ESR, when it shows up on their desktop or applications that its says Firefox ESR and not just Firefox. 
5) Update the Title bar to say "Firefox ESR"

If needed we can make more cosmetic changes in the next dot release.

Is it OK for this to be "You are currently on the esr update channel"?

If we do it "ESR" as opposed to "esr" I'm ok with it.

OK, should be fine, and simpler than the original form.

These are doable (the channel will be just "ESR" though, as bhearsum notes).

We can't add this kind of string to the about dialog on a weeks notice - this will need to bubble up through the normal channels for proper l10n.

The only simple way to achieve these is by changing "Firefox" to "Firefox ESR" globally across the app. All references to "Firefox" in the UI would be changed to "Firefox ESR".
PS: "through the channels" probably implies that this goes with ESR 16 or whichever that version is going to be, and not 10.x. What comes through the channels is bound to a gecko/firefox version 11+
Laura: We need a version of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=591271&action=edit that roughly matches http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/official/content/about-wordmark.png (i.e. without the included logo). Should I file another marketing::design bug?

I think that would be best. CC me and I'll get it to the right designer for a quick turn-around.

Unfortunately, it looks like the build system forcibly lower cases the channel name, so this doesn't work =(. Gavin, any idea if we can make this change some other way, or are we stuck?

This does, of course, affect all dialogs and error pages, so you'll get things like "Firefox ESR is currently in offline mode".

:(. Oh well. If we can fix it great. If we can't until later, that's fine too. 


I spoke with Kev per comment 10 and he said he would comment yesterday with the final decision. As he has not, Kev, friendly ping.

Don't think you should worry about it, not a big deal since update channel is kind of an implementation detail (none of the other possible values are user-friendlied in any way).

The 32-bit Linux ESR build just finished and I confirmed that the wordmark is present in it, too. Thanks again for your help here Gavin.


use a different wordmark and possibly other branding changes for Firefox 10 ESR
