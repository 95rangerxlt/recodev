Full error message follows:
ASSERT: gBrowser.addProgressListener was called with a second argument, which is not supported.  See bug 608628.
Stack Trace:
0:addProgressListener([object Object],136)
1:()
2:([object Event])

I did look up the bug 608628 and the entry I found did not seem to be describing the same problem, thus the separate entry.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. simply run the program.
2. error as stated above occurs.
3. Click on OK, program opens as usual.

This is new.  I have not had this occur before today.

I'm seeing this as well. Hasn't appeared before the 3/24 nightly build.
Click on an image at Amazon to zoom and you see it as well, ie http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033ZHIJU click on the vitamin bottle.

Ah, it's a bug with window creation, you can duplicate it by selecting File, new window.
If I disable the extensions Stylish and Greasemonkey, this issue goes away. Some other extensions that might be causing this are NoScript, Xmarks and Status-4-Evar. I think there might be a full list @ http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2142293.
Well that makes it simple for the developers then. I am not a programmer :) But clearly if the change to gBrowser.addProgressListener was intentional, then this is not a bug, and all the extensions need to be updated. (Raising additional question, would this cause backward compatibility issues if the second argument was previously required?)
I took the easiest solution first, and it seems to have cured the problem.  I disabled No Script and the problem went away.
Sherry confirmed, disabling Noscript 2.0.9.9. gets rid of the message
Quoting the forums linked in Comment 4 -- looks like the extensions just need patching:

Yes, the extensions need fixing. Until then, I don't think we need to assert noisily.

True, but the Assert pop-up prompted me to update my extensions as soon as I saw it event though it was late and I normally would have left it till morning.
That's fine - it isn't a critical issue.

Error on startup: "ASSERT: gBrowser.addProgressListener was called with a second argument", w/ Greasemonkey, NoScript, Stylish, or XMarks

assertion

Bug 644645: don't NS_ASSERT when an extra parameter is passed to tabbrowser.addProgressListener, since popular extensions do that and it's annoying
