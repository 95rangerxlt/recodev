The following changes need to be made:
1) the ko-KR plugin needs to be renamed to match the filename in it's updateURL
2) the ja-JP[M] Yahoo shopping and auction plugins are missing icons
3) the updateURL for the ja-JP[M] Yahoo plugins needs to be changed
4) the zh-TW and zh-CN Yahoo plugins are missing icons

After these changes, the following should be verified for all CJKT builds:
1) The updateURL filename in each searchplugin matches the .src's filename
2) Each .src file has a corresponding icon file (with an identical filename, except for the extension)
3) The list.txt file in each searchplugins directory uses the correct file name for all the search plugins (if it doesn't, builds will fail, so this should be easier to verify)

in region.properties:
4) The defaultenginename for CJKT builds all match the name of the Yahoo plugin for that locale
5) The browser.search.order.1 prefs match the name of the Yahoo plugin for that locale

Rename the ko-KR plugin from yahoo-kr.src to yahoo.src, and rename yahoo-kr.gif to yahoo.gif. Change the entry in list.txt.

This diff isn't really useful, but it shows that yahoo-jp-auctions.gif and yahoo-jp-shopping.gif need to be copied from the 1.8.0 branch to the ja-JP and ja-JPM searchplugin folders on the 1.0 branch.

Change the updateURLs for the ja-JP and ja-JPM plugins.

patch for #4

Again, not very useful, but shows where the yahoo.gif from the 1.8.0 branch (http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla1.8.0/source/zh-CN/browser/searchplugins/yahoo-cn.gif) need to be copied over to the 1.0 aviary branch.

Looking for review on the four patches combined.
This is too late for 1.0.8.  Final bits were frozen last week.  Nominated it for 1.0.9.

This means that the ja-JP[M] Yahoo shopping and auction plugins and the zh-TW and zh-CN Yahoo plugins will not have icons in 1.0.8. Since Yahoo is the default plugin for zh-CN and zh-TW, the search experience for Chinese users will be pretty bad.
Requesting reassessment: these only affect l10n builds that haven't even been spun the first time, and fix search-plugin-update issues that are important as we soonish reach EOL on 1.0.x.
shaver's right, blocking. Let's get these reviewed and in soon please.

State of the Plugins

This is a short summary of the CJKT search plugins on the 1.0.x branch. Everything looks correct, except for the fact that all the plugins but the ja-JP[M] ones point to 404s as the update URLs. Shaver, I seem to recall you saying this is bad for 1.0.x builds? If so, I guess I should file a server ops bug to get the plugins uploaded to the URLs in the plugins (the ones marked 404 in this file)?
Thank you for the summary, that's great!

Please do file the server-ops bug, morgamic can fix us right up.
Gavin:  Can you point us to the Server Ops bug?  Maybe just add it as a dependency to this bug so we make sure to cover all the bases for final verification?
Sorry, though I had made note here of the other bug. Bug 328498 is the server ops bug.
