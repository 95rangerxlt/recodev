I guess the magic happens in browserconfig.properties but maybe we want to change something in the process?

We can just change it in browserconfig.properties. Do we want to change it for all branding (nightly, "devpreview", official)?
nightly and unofficial are using other pages from what I see, not the search page
Yeah, I know, but that doesn't mean we can't change them. Given that the branding and search URL replacing works correctly with about:home, I don't think there's any real reason to not switch them. But we can do that in a separate change at some later point, too.

Use about:home as the home page for nightlies, unofficial (alphas/devpreviews), and official branding (betas/releases).

(browser.startup.homepage_reset has been unused since forever - doesn't even have a default in firefox.js anymore)

uir+ with the following caveat: we may need to special case zh-CN so that it still points to http://zh-cn.start3.mozilla.com/firefox/ but we can deal with that in a follow-up

Maybe give the metrics guys a heads up that this change is being made? Shouldn't matter, but just in case.
Also, since this is that actual change that moves us away from a Google-hosted start page... I think it would be appropriate for someone (beltzner? shaver?) to formally approve this as being OK wrt to any known contractual obligations. Pretty sure this has already been discussed, but that's 87% assumption!

Looks like this broke --enable-official-branding:

Preprocessor.Error: ('/home/dbaron/builds/mozilla-central/mozilla/other-licenses/branding/firefox/locales/jar.mn', 3, 'UNDEFINED_VAR', 'AB_CD')
Bustage fix because I failed to test official branding:
