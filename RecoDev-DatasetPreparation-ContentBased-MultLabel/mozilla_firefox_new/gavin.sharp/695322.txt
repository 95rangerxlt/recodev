Two issues I discovered while debugging test failures in bug 692130:

1) this test leaves text in the search bar after it is run
2) this test fails when run individually

1) is easy to fix. 2) seems to be caused by assuming that the search bar already has an undo history, which isn't necessarily true given what the test does.
