Let's use the same assets for ESR17.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #720837 +++

bug 717106 talks about using a different wordmark for the upcoming ESR release, and possibly other branding changes like the display name. We need to put these changes somewhere and make sure the release uses them.

If we use a separate branding directory it would be great to update the release mozconfigs to set it properly when MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL is esr. browser/config/mozconfigs{linux32,linux64,macosx64,win32}/release are the files in question.
