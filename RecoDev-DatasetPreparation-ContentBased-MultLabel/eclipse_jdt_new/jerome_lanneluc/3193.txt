Calling ISourceManipulation.delete results in a BufferChangeEvent indicating a complete substituation
	of the buffer's content.
	Expected behavior: deletion of the according source range.

	This is because we use the JDOM to implement delete. We create a JDOM, remove nodes,
	and then replace the buffer with the content of the resulting JDOM. This makes our
	operations work nice, so I am not yet sure how to solve the buffer event problem.

	Need to implement the same mechanism as CreateElementInCUOperation (see executeOperation()
	that uses the fInsertionPosition)

Fixed by using replace(...) on the buffer instead of setContent.
