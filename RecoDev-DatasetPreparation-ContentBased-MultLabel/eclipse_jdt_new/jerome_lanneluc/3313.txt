Look for senders of addChild... you'll notice CompilationUnitStructureRequestor has several which also include
addField/Method/MemberType being sent to SourceTypeElementInfo's.

So for the typical type which has a 2 fields & 20 methods, you have:
	- an 23 element array of all children,
	- a 2 element field array &
	- a 20 element method array.

Quite the overhead (~120 bytes) for no real value... getFields/Methods could easily be implemented to extract
the items out of the children.

NOTES:

NOTES:
Performance work
Implemented getFields, getMethods and getMemberTypes to extract the items out 
of the children.
Removed the corresponding fields.
