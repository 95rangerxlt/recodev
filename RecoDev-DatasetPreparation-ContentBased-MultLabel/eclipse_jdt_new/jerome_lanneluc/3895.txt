Because refactoring is applied to the whole workbench it also
	updates other projects which might not be related to the one
	I apply the refactoring. This can introduce errors into the
	workbench:

	1. Add JProject1 and import JUnit
	2. Add JProject2 and import JUnit
	3. (optional: add JProject1 to the classpath of JProject2)
	4. Rename the package junit.framework to _junit.framework
	==> package imports of JProject1 are also changed and
			result in compile errors since JProject2 is not visible (on CP)

	waiting for: 1GIJU1P: ITPJCORE:WINNT - search: java project scope does not work as expected

	fixed for 204 - case with projects that do not reference each other
