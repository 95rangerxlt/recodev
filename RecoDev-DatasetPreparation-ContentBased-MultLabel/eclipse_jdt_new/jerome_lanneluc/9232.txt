In TypePage, line 1240, after fCreatedType= createdType;
add
		cu.delete(true, null);
		if (cu.exists()) {
			System.out.println("still exists");
		}

-> exists returns true.

Testing this in a text class works. As a difference the code in TypePage is 
called inside a WorkbenchRunnable. Could that be a problem? (Is the JavaModel 
listing to deltas itself?)

Did we close the element and is its resource still existing ?
No we didn't close the element. It was closed only during the delta processing.
Fixed DeleteResourceElementsOperation so that it closes the elements it 
processes.


ICompilationUnit.delete() fails
