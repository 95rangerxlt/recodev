build 2002-04-23+JUI patch on WinXP.

- in my workspace I have org.apache.ant (binary project) and 
org.eclipse.core.resources (source project) and others. 
- org.eclipse.core.resources requires org.apache.ant. 
- I remove Ant from the workspace and have a problem with the classpath. 
- I re-import Ant as a binary project and the problem still remains on 
org.eclipse.core.resources saying that it is missing the ant.jar from the Ant 
project. 
- If I do a Rebuild on org.eclipse.core.resources its ok.

moving to JDT CORE
Classpath related markers where not updated for the dependent projects when a 
project was added, removed, opened or closed.
Fixed.


Adding binary project doesn't fix classpath problems.
