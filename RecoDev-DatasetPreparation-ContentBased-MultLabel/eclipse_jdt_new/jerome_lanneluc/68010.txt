use build 3.0RC3

1) change preference to show return type inside outliner 
   Preferences>Java>Appearance>how method return type 
2) create a new java project that use a 1.5 jre
3) open type java.io.PrintWriter

Inside outliner you can see three methods "Appendable append(char)".
These methods are:
  method - PrintWriter append(char)
  bridge method - Writer append(char)
  bridge method - Appendable append(char)



The problem come from binary method handle (BinaryNemthod). The occurrence 
count is the same for these three methods.

Fixed ClassFileInfo.generateMethodInfos(...) to increase the occurence count 
of duplicate methods.
