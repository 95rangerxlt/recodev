204:
1. Create a type A
2. open it in TypeHierarchy
3. edit the type to extends from java.util.Vector
4. save.: Type Hierarchy does not change

From debugging I see that no typeHierarchyChanged is received 
(TypeHierarchyLifeCycle)

From debugging I see that the Java Element delta sent for the save ends
at the CompilationUnit. No affected childern.

The isAffectedByType(IJavaElementDelta delta, IJavaElement element) method was 
not taking the direct super type into account. It worked in R1.0 because 
java.lang.Object was always included in the hierarchy. Now it is included only 
if explicitely referenced.

Fixed isAffectedByType(IJavaElementDelta delta, IJavaElement element) to use 
includesTypeOrSupertype(IType) instead of includesSupertypeOf(IType).

Added TypeHierarchyNotificationTests.testAddExtendsSourceType().
