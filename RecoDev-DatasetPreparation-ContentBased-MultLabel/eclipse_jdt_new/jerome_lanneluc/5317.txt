Open a hierarchy view that has several layers.
Change the superclass of one of the hierarchy members.

Please localize whether this is a viewer refresh or type hierarchy delta 
problem.

can reproduce:
1. Create class A extends Vector
2. Create class B
3. Open type hierachy on A
4. Edit class B to extend A. Save.
5. No changes in the hierarchy view.

The type hierarchy changed is received. An hierarchy.refresh is invoked (in an 
async runnable, so not anymore in the change listener), the tree is refreshed, 
but children of A are empty.

move to jcore.
Problem was in the CommitWorkingCopyOperation that was not forcing the original 
compilation unit to be opened. Thus the delta was wrong and the hierarchy was 
not sending a 'hierarchy need refresh' event.


Reparenting class should refresh hierarchy
