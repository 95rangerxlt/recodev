The Java Model caches project info and package fragment root infos in the same 
LRU cache as other openables. They should be cached in a Hashtable as we don't 
want them to be ever flushed.

In the meantime, we should decrease the default size of the LRU cache.

Added new class JavaModelCache that centralizes all the caching. This cache 
uses different table:
- a HashMap for projects and pkg fragement roots
- an ElementCache for packages
- an ElementCache for compilation units and classes
- a HashMap for children of compilation units and classes


Separate caching of project and pkg fragment root from caching of openables
