During updating projects using the selfhosting tool, I had problems with a 
JavaModelException coming from setting the classpath, stating that the project 
does not exist. As I just created the project this seemed to be bug.
Can't give a reproducible case but from debugging this is my suspect:

JavaModelManager contains a list fProjectsBeingDeleted.
It is set with JavaModelManager.deleting and removed in 
checkProjectBeingAdded() or deleted

- deleted has no references, seems to be unused
- checkProjectBeingAdded is called in a resource change event.
  as I call everything in a workspacerunnable, this will not be invoked
  before all projects are created.

Pls investigate
The project should have been removed from the list of project being deleted 
before firing the delta. This was not done because only ADDED projects were 
checked. Fixed by checking CHANGED projects as well (this is the case of the 
replace: the project is removed then added and the resulting delta is CHANGED).

Also removed the unused method deleted.
