Severity: 1
Summary: DBCS – The GB18030 character cannot be correctly generated 
into “.classpath” file when new a source folder named with GB18030 character.
Steps to recreate problem:
1.	Start up "New Source Folder" wizard;
2.	Set the new folder's name contain GB18030 character, for 
example “newfolder\u3400”;
3.	Click "Finish", new folder infor cannot be generated 
into '${PROJECT_BASE}/.classpath' file as  "<classpathentry kind="..." 
path="..."/>" correctly. The GB18030 character is encoded in error;
4.	Delete this source folder from the 
project, '${PROJECT_BASE}/.classpath' can't be updated correspondingly.

<<Error>>
The GB18030 character cannot be correctly generated into “.classpath” file when 
new a source folder named with GB18030 character.

<<Expected Result>>
The GB18030 character can be correctly generated into “.classpath” file when 
new a source folder named with GB18030 character.
	
<<Cause>>
Eclipse maintains “.classpath” file for each project using UTF8 encoding. When 
new a source folder, Eclipse insert a new "<classpathentry>" element into 
the “.classpath” file using system's default encoding. So error occurs when the 
system's default encoing is not UTF8.

<<Solution>>
Modify “getSharedProperty” and “setSharedProperty” methods in JavaProject.java. 
Keep the encoding being UTF8 during reading and writing “.classpath” file.

May consider for 3.0.1, will mark it as such for now.
Assuming that on a chinese platform the correct encoding is set for the 
workspace, shouldn't the workspace encoding be used instead of hardcoding "UTF-
8" ?
In my chinese platform, the encoding of the workplace is set 
as "gb18030". ".classpath" is a XML file and eclipse creates and maintains it 
with "utf8" encoding. When new a source folder, Eclipse insert 
a "<classpathentry>" element into the “.classpath” file using system's default 
encoding, that's "gb18030" in my system. So error occurs. 
Thanks. So we would use the .classpath encoding and not the workspace 
encoding. I want to avoid hardcoding "UTF-8".
Actually hardcoding "UTF-8" is fine as this encoding is always used to encode 
the .classpath.
Changed JavaProject#getSharedProperty(...) and setSharedProperty(...) (as 
proposed in the attached patch) to use an UTF-8 encoding when reading/writing 
the .classpath.

Added regression test ClasspathTests#testEncoding().

Release to both R3_0_maintenance and HEAD.
Verified for 3.0.1 RC1
