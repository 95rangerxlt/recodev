When computing a type hierarchy on a region, all types in the region are forced 
to be opened.
The RegionBasedHierarchyBUuilder should use HierarchyBinaryTypes as the 
IndexBasedHierarchyBuilder.
RegionBasedTypeHierarchyBuilder now uses the same mechanism as the 
IndexBasedHierarchyBuilder, i.e. it reuse the IType if it is opened, otherwise 
it uses a HierarchyBinaryType or a BasicCompilationUnit.


Type hierarchy on region populates Java Model cache for types in the region
