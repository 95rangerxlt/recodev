Srinkanth, I'm ready to submit the patch for this -- would you prefer this as a cumulative patch to the patches in bug 402173 (formatter for lambda), or do you want an independent patch for this.
(Silly me, I'd clumped all of the formatting for 1.8 into one test case, so now I'm picking it apart).

Sorry, I didn't see this question earlier. But it is answered by the fact that
the lambda work is released already. If you post a patch for reference expressions
alone, I'll take it forward.

Format support for method and constructor references

This is extracted from the patch posted by Jesper
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=227503) at
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=400830.

I did not extract the tests from there since all of the tests
involve 308 annotations.

I'll add fresh tests to verify the functionality.

I made the following changes and released the fix here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=c4e062ebcfc48b14b7c36c591e88d44ce5b3b5c0 - Thanks Jesper.
Tests will follow in a separate patch.

(1) Since the posting of the patch at (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=227503) at
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=400830, the fields of
ReferenceExpression have undergone a change. The field method which used
to be a SingleNameReference does not exist any more and has been replaced
with 'selector' which a char [] that stores the identifier. Adjusted the
patch accordingly.

(2) The type argument printing code appears to be copied from PSTR/PQTR
processing code - this is incorrect. We should adapt it from formatMessageSend.
Tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=4da206fbf61a10e973b62f504ebc9e4e8671589b

Thanks Jesper. Please include the tests that combine 335 and 308 as part of
type annotations formatting work.
