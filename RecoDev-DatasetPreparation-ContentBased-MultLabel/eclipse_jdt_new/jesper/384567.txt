3.8: Probably has always been buggy.

The following program compiles with ECJ, while it should not:

// --------------
public package p;
public class X {
}

3.8: Probably has always been buggy.

Also this:


public protected final private static volatile synchronized transient abstract native strictfp package p;
public class X {

}

I'll take a look.
Jesper, please take a look. TIA.

Patch and test

Very straighforward problem, patch and test
Patch looks good. I released it with a minor change to opt for a more
neutral message ("modifiers are not allowed here", instead of "modifiers are
not allowed for the package declaration" since annotations are allowed
and they are viewed as modifiers in some quarters, but annotations would
have illegal there anyways) via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=f6b16290d9141509dffddf2d9dc5a88115698e2a

(For the record, no plans to release this in master even though this is
not java 8 specific - we want to freeze activity on master to the extent
possible, admitting only very selective, targeted fixes)

Thanks Jesper.

I'm seeing this in Kepler SR1 (Platform 4.3.1 and JDT 3.9.1), using Java 7 on Windows 7. So it's definitely NOT specific to Java 8. Seems like this should be released to master since it affects Java (probably all versions at least back to 1.5)?

Java 8 development branch will become master shortly (~ March 20th) and this
fix will become available in 4.4 automatically. This is not important enough
to be back ported to prior releases, but with 4.4 will apply to all compliance
levels, not just 1.8
