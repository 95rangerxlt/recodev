I have the following line of code:

private Runnable disposeRunnable = () -> dispose();

I change it to:

private Runnable disposeRunnable = this::dispose(); // not syntactical correct 

and save. I know that I still need to remove the () at the end but CTRL+S is hardcode into my fingers.

JDT changes the code to:

dispose();

To test this, you can use org.eclipse.jface.resource.ImageRegistry and adjust line 57 to the starting point of:

private Runnable disposeRunnable = () -> dispose();

package snippet;

public class Snippet {

	Runnable disposeRunnable = this::dispose();

	void dispose() {

	}
}

-----------------------------------------------------------

On the above code snippet, apply formatter by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F. 

In Neon build, we can see that the code is deleted.

In Mars release build, I get the following exception:
Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1
	at java.util.ArrayList.elementData(ArrayList.java:371)
	at java.util.ArrayList.set(ArrayList.java:399)
	at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.formatter.TokenManager.applyFormatOff(TokenManager.java:443)
	at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.formatter.DefaultCodeFormatter.prepareFormattedCode(DefaultCodeFormatter.java:198)
...

There is no issue with Luna build i.e. applying the formatter has no change on code with no exception.

Moving to JDT/Core for analysis.
Mateusz, please take a look.
I tend to consider this as a corner case, because when the user lets the code complete, he doesn't get the (). Of course, we should not remove user code, though.
New Gerrit change created: https://git.eclipse.org/r/54856
The problem was that for the line with compile error the parsed AST had two malformed members with overlapping ranges. The formatter was not ready for this case.
I'm not sure if this is a problem in the parser, but this fix prevents code deletion by the formatter.
Gerrit change https://git.eclipse.org/r/54856 was merged to [master].
