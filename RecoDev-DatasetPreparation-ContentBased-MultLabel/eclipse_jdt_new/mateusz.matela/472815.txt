New in Mars:

If I create a new class or interface the class body (consisting of one empty line so far) is not indented.
I do not see any indentation issue with the new class created in Mars via "New Java Class" wizard.

Please specify the steps you are using to create the class and the result that you are observing.
To make sure, it isn't something about our code formatter, I have switched to "Eclipse [built-in]" before these steps.

- Go to Package Explorer
- Expand a project
- Navigate to some package
- Right click that package
- Select New -> Class
- Type "A" as name
- Hit Finish

The newly created class A will be opened. The caret will be in line 1 (I think, it used to be in the first class body line in prior versions). If you click in the first class body line to position the caret, you'll see, that this line is completely unindented.

The caret is at the beginning of line 1 in newly opened editor of class A. 

> If you click in the first class body line to position the caret, you'll see, that this line is completely unindented.

The caret is placed at the beginning of line 4 in class body. See attached screenshot.

Both of these are same as in previous Eclipse versions.
I checked with Eclipse 3.8.1, 4.3 and 4.4 to confirm.
Closing as worksforme. Please provide more details to reproduce the issue if it differs from the observed behavior.
I double checked this in Luna. And there the caret is in line one as well, but the first class body line is indented.

When the class is freshly created, it looks as follows.

#######################################
package a.b.c

public class A
{
    |
}
#######################################

The | denotes, where the caret should be when clicking into that line somewhere right of it. This is, how it should look like and how it does look like in Luna.

In Mars it would be as follows.

#######################################
package a.b.c

public class A
{
|
}
#######################################

So there's a change. Yes, you could say "works for me", if you want. But it is a bug.

Eclipse never formatted code like this when using the 'Eclipse [built-in]' profile.
Ok, this is getting strange now.

You're right. Using Eclipse built-in or Java Conventions this line stays unundented. Though using our nice next-line-brace formatter with indented empty lines Luna indented this line when creating a new class.

So it is a fact, that this behavior changed and is buggy in Mars.

Now I have checked the behavior in Mars again, unticked "Empty Lines" in our formatter settings. The line is unindented then. Ticking that setting and saving formatter rules the line is still unindented when creating a new file. So I cannot return to the previous behavior, because the formatter forgets this setting.

If you don't want to deal with this bug, just say it and I will be quite here. But is IS a bug.

Is this a profile or a contributed formatter?

We do want to deal with the "bug" if we can see the bug, i.e. if you can provide us with reproducible steps.

INFOLOG Java code formatter

The attached code formatter is saved with an older version of eclipse. I use this since years in my workspace, which I use to carry over to any new eclipse.

Import it in Luna and you'll see that line indented.

I asked, because you rushed to close this ticket as resolved before it was clear, what I was talking about. So I thought, you just didn't want this report.

Sorry, if I am a bit harsh from time to time. It's just because many tickets here are pushed away for little reasons. I know, you're doing a phantasic job here. And it's hard to deal with all the bullshit. So misconceptions happen easily.

Sure, no offense taken and thanks for the kudos. And for insisting :-).


The problem you see is not restricted to class creation but a general bug introduced with the new formatter the 'Empty lines' option is no longer working.

1. paste the following snippet into the 'Package Explorer':
public class A {

}
2. Format
==> no indentation (expected)
3. In the formatter preferences enable 'Empty lines' in the 'Indentation' tab
4. Format
==> BUG: no indentation on empty line

This used to work in releases prior to Mars.

Mateusz, please fix this for 4.5.1. Thanks.
Mateusz, feel free to club this with other related work if any.
Great. Thanks.

If other related work is done, could you possibly also fix the following, which never worked in any Eclipse release?

If you type the following code somewhere, where it's valid:

##############################
new MouseListener()
{
}
##############################

Now let Eclipse add the unimplemented methods.

All empty lines between the method stubs are unindented, no matter what you set this option to.

If you type
##############################
new MouseListener
##############################

hit CTRL+SPACE and hit enter to let Eclipse complete the structure, these lines are fine indented (even in Mars).

I'm afraid this is not a simple bug to be fixed while doing something else. My design was that an empty line would be indented as much as its neighboring lines (maximum indent of the two, IIRC). This is fine for empty lines between normal instructions, but if there are no tokens between the braces, the formatter can't know that any additional indentation is needed.

This will probably require some phantom tokens for empty lines to store the indentation information. I'll see what I can do.

Thanks Mateusz.
Is this still going in for 4.5.1? Can I move it to 4.5.2 otherwise?

Most probably I won't make it in time for 4.5.1. I'm quite busy with other stuff this week and the next, and there are other bugs that look more important.
Moving out to 4.5.2
