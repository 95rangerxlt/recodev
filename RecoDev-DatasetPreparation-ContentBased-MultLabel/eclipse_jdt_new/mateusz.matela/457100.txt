Failures and errors found in some unit test cases - Run 
a) RunDOMTests
  - ASTRewritingStatementsTests.testBug413592 8 NPE errors pointing to one single error
  - few formatter failures) and 
b) RunFormatterRegressionTests (tests 447 and 451)

Additional tests /failure found while testing will be added in this bug rather than the parent bug to avoid clutter

There was one simple bug in formatter wrapping, other failures and NPEs happened because the formatter didn't get proper source level in options so code parsing reported errors. I fixed these problems and pushed changes into my github. Shall I upload a new patch now or wait for more changes to accumulate?

Oops, that's because Egit doesn't include binary changes in generated patch and these tests are stored in zip files. The only change inside is switching tab_size and indentation_size in the settings file. Can I just upload these zips as a separate file, or do you need a full patch with binary changes (I guess you won't be able to load it if you use Egit)?

Just include this in your next patch once all the changes are accumulated.

You can upload the zips as separate file.
