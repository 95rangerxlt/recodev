It would be nice if "Add return statement" would insert/suggest the best matched 
variable that should be returned.




e.g.




public Dimension getPreferredSize() {


                Dimension dim = inlined.getPreferredSize();


                Dimension myDim = new Dimension();


                myDim.setSize(inlined.getWidth()*1.5,


                              inlined.getHeight()*1.5);


				


            }




Here the last line the Quick Fix "Add return statement" is possible - but it 
inserts "return null;" at the end. It could just as well insert "return myDim;"




Maybe has it as an second quick fix, so the quick fix options would be:




Add return null statement


Add return myDim statement
