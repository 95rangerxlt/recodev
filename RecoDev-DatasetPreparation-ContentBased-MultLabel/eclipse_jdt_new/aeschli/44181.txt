Hi,
Generate Delegate methods display only public methods for target class.
For classes in the same package also default and protected methods should be shown.
And for subclasses in other packages protected should be shown (I think more for
completeness than for usefulness).

Bye

patch against jdt.ui

It seems that I20051011-1655 only considers public methods. I've attached a
patch which allows default and package scoped members if the target type is in
the same package.
