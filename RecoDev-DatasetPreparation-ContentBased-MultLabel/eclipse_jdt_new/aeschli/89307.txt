In latest the code snippet for code formatter options related to type arguments
is  the same than for options related to parameterized type references.
It should be updated to show the usage of the different options.

Proposal that would improve the code snippet for whitespace options for type
arguments.
Tagged as M7 since the actual code snippet doesn't show at all the usage of the
corresponding optios.
I released your patch but changed the type argument example to

x.<String, Element>foo();

as 
Map<String, Element> map=\n new HashMap<String, Element>();

doesn't compile (it would require that the HashMap constructor has method type
arguments)
