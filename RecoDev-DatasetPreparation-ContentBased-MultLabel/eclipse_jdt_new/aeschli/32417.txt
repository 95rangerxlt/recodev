I often want to browse all Action subclasses in JDT UI but I currently cannot 
do this easily. The option to show the package name helps but I'd like to fully 
hide type outside of my working set.

not for 2.1

Is the working set used as a filter on the hierarchy, or is the working set just
a more complex input of the hierarchy?
In the first case the problem is that you won't see certain branches of the tree
if the parent happens to be outside of the working set. E.g. in the normal
hierarchy this would mean the hierarchy is empty when 'Object' is filtered.
It would act as filter. The presentation would behave in the same was as when 
you open a type hierarchy on a package or project, i.e., base types outside of 
the working set are shown with a hollow type icon.

Type hierarchy should support working sets
