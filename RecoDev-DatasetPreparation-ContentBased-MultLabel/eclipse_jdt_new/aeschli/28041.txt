build 20021210

1. Create a new Java project P1
2. Check the box "Allow output folders per source folder"
3. Set the output folder of the source entry to "bin4"
4. Finish

5. Select P1 and open the properties dialog.

Observe: The box is unchecked and the source folder does not have "bin4"
as its output folder.  Looking at the .classpath file confirms that this
info is not recorded.

Expectation: It should work.

fixed for M4
I am still not able to specify multiple output folders in build 200212181304 
(M4).
Behavior is as Jeem reported.
The dialog allows to enter 'bin4', should be 'P1/bin4'

Was that the problem?
add validation to no allow 'bin4', when there is no project called 'bin4'

Yes that was the problem I was having...thanks.
fixed in 20030113
