Build ID: I20080330-1350

I have no idea how to reproduce it. It happends only "recentely" (3.4M5/6).

Sometimes, on an Unresolved type name (simplename), the tooltip with quick fix appears when i put the mouse cursor on the type name, and one "nonexistent" type appears.

If the java editor is containing class "a.b.c.A", and the unresolved typename is "MyClass", the wrong quick fix would be 'Import a.b.c.MyClass', while the class doesn't exist.

This is quick fix. What happens if you do code assist wight after the the name.

A small code snippet where this can happen would be nice.
Nothing happens. The imports are not modified.

I'm sorry it happens every 2 days, with no apparent reason except intensive use of JDT.

I don't have any snippet, sorry, but i might check the error log next time it happens (i've forgotten until now).

Screenshot of the quick fix

Here is an example of the error. Nothing appears in the error log.

Im' working on a the java file "jackplugin.popup.actions.CheckAction"
found the problem: the recovered types are proposed as new imports.

An example is as shown in your screenshot:
Quick fix on:
ArrayList<String> a= new ArrayList<String>();
