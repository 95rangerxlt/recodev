Not sure if this is a side effect of templates, but, e.g., for "Add field" to 
the following code sequence:

	private Grammar grammar;
	private List errors;
	
	public GrammarWrapper(Grammar grammar, List errors) {...

The result used to be, e.g.,

	private Grammar grammar;
	private List errors;
	private ErrorGrammar base;
	
	public GrammarWrapper(Grammar grammar, List errors) {...

Which was fine. But is now:

	private Grammar grammar;
	private List errors;
	
	private ErrorGrammar base;
	public GrammarWrapper(Grammar grammar, List errors) {...

Templates should not have to include explicit whitespace at beginning and end 
to get generation to come out right, as templates have no idea what context 
they are inserted in.

If this is not the problem, please fix for 2.1 anyway. ;-} (I know choice 
of "spacing" is arbitrary, but I doubt any programmer would manually produce 
the above result.)

We currently assing whitespaces/new lines to the previous field. So the new 
field inserted after a field comes after the new lines.

To change this is unfortunatly a bigger change. What I can do is to add new 
fields at first position. What do you think about that?

Or I can add an extra new line after the new field.

Why don't you just not add new lines to the previous field? Didn't do that before.

>What I can do is to add new fields at first position

You mean before existing fields? Not a good idea.
there's no way to change the problematic behavoiur without a rewrite.
we discussed it here, we will go for a.), always insert at the first position
