This is on the UI plan. 

In the meantime, you could manually edit the preference file located in:

<workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.core\pref_store.ini

Exit Eclipse, add following line, and restart:
org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.noEffectAssignment=ignore
Martin, can you take care of this. You are maintaining the compiler preference 
page in the UI land.
