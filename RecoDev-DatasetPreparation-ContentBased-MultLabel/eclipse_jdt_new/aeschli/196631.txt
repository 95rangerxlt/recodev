Build ID: N20070714-0010

I decided to put it in one bug, because I'm not sure whether the first part is a valid bug. Anyways, I think the fix will be trivial.

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open a class
2. Select "Extract Superclass" from the "Refactor" menu
3. Click "Add..." button next to a table with types to extract a superclass
from
=> As I said, I'm not sure is it a feature or a bug, but the "Choose Type" dialog is not modal. Moreover, "OK" button is enabled even when there is no type selected.
