Build 20020125

- Define a project A with source folder 'src1'. 
- Go to the .classpath file and edit it to insert one extra line:
<classpathentry kind="src" path="src2"/> below the line referring to first 
source folder: <classpathentry kind="src" path="src1"/>.
- Now, try to add this missing source folder 'src2', it isn't allowed by the 
wizard, one has to add a basic folder instead.

Note: It is not such an uncommon scenario, the classpath modification could 
simply occur by catching up with a shared classpath having one more source 
folder on it, and which is locally missing.
