If you have switched on the compiler warning about unused parameters then you 
do not get shown the quick assist which allows you to assign that parameter to 
a new field:
----------------------------------
public class A
{
   public A(final int a) //<--use quick assist on parameter a here
   {
   }
}
-----------------------------------
you only get the option of removing that parameter!!

We don't offer quick assist as long as there are errors. In this case the 
quick fix should contain the quick assist "assign to field" as well since it 
is a valid fix.
agree
will change so it shows up if there is only an error. have to wait for jdt.text
to add API to IJavaAnnotation so I know if its an error or warning.
should say 'if there is only a warning'
Workaround:
  When there are syntax errors in the method body, Eclipse will not know that 
the parameter is never read.
  So for example add a comma:

  public void A(final int a)
  {,
  }
  
  Now the "Assign parameter to new field" fix is available. Remove the comma 
after applying the quick fix and that's it.
quck assist now show up as long as there is no underlying error (warning is ok)
