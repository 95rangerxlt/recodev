If I select new->project from the file menu, and then select java project (or
any project for that matter) from the dialog that comes up, I get a new dialog
where I can specify the project name. The dialog is called "New java project".

This dialog is far too large, it doesn't fit in a 740x1024 screen even though
there is plenty of empty space at the lower part of it. This means that I have
to resize the dialog to be able click the buttons at the bottom of it.

Can you post a screenshot of what it looks like on your screen?

The space at the bottom is reserved for a progress bar and error message used by
many wizards.

Screen shot from 1024x768 screen running Gnome 2.8 (Fedora Core 3)

As you can see the buttons are completely outside the screen.
One would think that 1024x768 would be enough to run eclipse.
This is a common screen resolution on many laptops.
Yes, I think something is wrong here...
Moving to JDT.  The project seems to be really tall to accomodate the size of
the next page of the wizard.  It seems too tall on a GNOME system where the
default font size is a 10 point font (at 96 DPI).

I'd be happy if you could let me know if the fix worked for your setup
