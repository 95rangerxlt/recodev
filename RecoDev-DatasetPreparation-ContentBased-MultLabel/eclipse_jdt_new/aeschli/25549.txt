This would be a wizard that allows the user to adapt methods of enclosed objects.
Example:

public class MyClass {
   private Object obj;
}

The wizard would allow me to specify that I want to adapt the hashCode and equals methods of the obj field:

public class MyClass {
   private Object obj;

   // these two methods added by wizard
   public int hashCode() {
      return obj.hashCode();
   }

   public boolean equals(Object object) {
      return obj.equals(object);
   }
}

The wizard could look much like the Override Methods wizard. It should provide the option to adapt methods of all visible fields, as well as objects returned by simple (no-arg) getter methods.

Martin, what happened to the 'create delegate' feature? I couldn't find it. Is 
that still in the works?
It's on the 2.1 plan. Not asssigned to a milestone yet.
