When using the quick assist to assign to a new field from a constructor 
parameter it would be nice if the field created was final. The fields can be 
safely declared final around 99% of the time.

Choosing Quick Fix "Assign parameter to new field" no longer adds the final keyword, and I cannot find any place to configure this, nor any bug report where the reason was explained why this was removed.  Could this be reopened?

Ignore my previous comment.  The missing final keyword was caused by having a misspelled Constructor name, and quick assist was thus treating it as a normal method (with a missing return type).  I don't think older versions would offer quick fixes when there was an error like that in the code hence why I never ran into this problem before.
See bug 130922 for people who prefer no 'final'.
