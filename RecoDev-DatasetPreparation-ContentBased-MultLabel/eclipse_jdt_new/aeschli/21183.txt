If you use the enclosing_type variable in your javadoc comment template, it is 
not properly filled in when you make a new class (using the New Class dialog).  
Probably the class should be created, then after creating and saving, javadoc 
should be added.  I suspect the variables don't have valid values yet at the 
time the javadoc is prepended to the class.

Javadoc comment template is managed by UI. 
Moving to JDT/UI.
The new code templates now honor the tag, but fill in the wrong value. Here is 
my test case:

- create class A
- change type template to include enclosing_type
- create class C enclosed in A

The Javadoc comment is

	/**
	 * @author .....
	 * C
	 * To change this generated comment go to 
	 * Window>Preferences>Java>Code Generation>Code Template
	 */
