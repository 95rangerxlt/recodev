Build ID: I20070621-1340

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create some non-abstract class extending an abstract class.
2. In project properites / Java Compiler set Compiler compliance level to 6.0 and Source compatibility to 1.4
3. Using "Add unimplemented methods" create missing abstract method stubs. They get @Override annotation which does not compile under 1.4
