Create a subclass of TransferHandler. Override canImport. The Javadoc comment 
generated is "@see javax.swing.TransferHandler#canImport
(javax.swing.JComponent, java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor)", but it shuold 
be "@see javax.swing.TransferHandler#canImport(javax.swing.JComponent, 
java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor [])" - note the missing [] on the second 
parameter.

Observed in 2.1 M3 and in I20030115
fixed > 20030121
I just tested this with build I20030121, and it is not fixed.
...or did you mean it will be fixed in the next build after 20010121?
yes, build after 20030121
This is not fixed in I200301221039.
that's what I'm saying. You'll find the fix in the current nightly builds, or 
in the integration build next week.
fixed
sorry forgot to explain. All integration builds this week (e.g.I200301221039) 
are only rebuilds of the 20030121, containing fixes for problems that prevented 
the integration build from working.
