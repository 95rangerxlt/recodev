Using I200412142000

1. Start eclipse with a fresh workspace.
2. Go to the code formatter page
3. Click on show

Note: the page uses the full height of the screen. It would be nice to have a a
'resonable' and limited size.

The large size might come from the white space tab where the preview table is
very large.
