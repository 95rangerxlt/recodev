To move code using the rewrite one has to copy and delete the nodes. This also 
removes markers attached to the portion of the code. Having a move would make 
it possible to actually preserve those markers.

Martin, what do you think ?

No, I found some PRs complaining about lost markers in extract method. Now 
that I use AST rewriting I thought we can fix it by providing a move place 
holder.
