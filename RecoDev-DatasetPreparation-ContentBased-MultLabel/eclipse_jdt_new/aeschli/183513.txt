In the following code (single source file):

public class X {
	public static void method() {
	}
}

class Y extends X {
	public static void method() {
	}
}

Go to either method and invoke inline rename (Alt-Shift-R).  Both unrelated methods are marked for renaming.  Once one is changed the false match reverts to its original name.

Bug is in LinkedNodeFinder
fixed > 20070423
I am still seeing this in 3.3M7 I20070503-1400: Renaming one of the methods in-place also modifies the other, leading to a misleading in-editor preview.  When Enter is pressed the other method correctly reverts.
The reason is bug 186114 in JDT.core.


This got fixed with bug 186114 being fixed.
