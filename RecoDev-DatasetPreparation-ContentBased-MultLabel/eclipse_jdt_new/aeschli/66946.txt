3.0RC2

The options:
- JRE 1.4 source compat.
- Save the settings... (the checkbox)
- Open generated index file in browser

are not remembered in (or reloaded from?) the javadoc.xml when rerunning the wizard.
Not critical for 3.0. 
JRE 1.4 source compat. could and should be restored, but the other two options 
are not part of a javadoc ANT file
the '1.4 source compatibility' mode is now also restored from the file
