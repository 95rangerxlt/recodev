I20060807-2000

No mnemonic for buttons in 'Search In' group. It's probably not possible to find free ones for all 4 buttons, so I'd suggest 'Search I&n' and 'Constr&uctor'.
(And speaking about mnemonics: the conflict between '&Implementors' and 'Case sens&itive' can be solved with 'Case sensiti&ve'.)

It was not immediately clear to me what 'Application libraries' means. I think it would be clearer if the 'libraries' checkboxes were next to each other, e.g.:
_ Sources  _ Required projects  _ JRE libraries  _ Application libraries

I first thought about naming them 'Other libraries', but that would be confusing in the search description (bug 153102).
