Many projects that I work on use different code formatting standards and it 
would make life easier if I could store these settings somewhere 
(presumably .project) and have eclipse respect the various formats as I hop 
between files in different projects.

More generally it would be good if all (or a large subset of) prefererences 
could be specified on a per project basis.  Obviously a per user setting would 
be needed to decide whether to use user or project settings where a conflict 
occurs.

Just a thought,

UI decision. JavaCore options are saved on a per project basis (not in 
shareable location yet, waiting on platform shareable preference support).


Martin, will this be supported with the new code formatter UI.

not so easy as lots of our code accesses the global formatter settings, e.g. for
