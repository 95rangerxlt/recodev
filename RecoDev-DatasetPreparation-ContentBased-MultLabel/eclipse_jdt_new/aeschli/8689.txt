This defect was opened due to TVT testing on WSAD.

On the Libraries tab of the Java Build Path properties, click on Attach Source 
button.  Click on the Extension button for the Root variable path.  The title 
is too long in French and it gets truncated (15 characters are truncated).

FYI...The problem has also been reported in the Spanish translation. 

I talked with Cam, the translation coordinator for WS WB, 
and she sent a note to JohnW on this topic this morning to 
see if this was working as designed, or if the dialog
was supposed to get bigger to fit the title. 

Thanks, Paula
There is no reasonable way to size a dialog to ensure that it is wide enough 
for a specific title text.
In general this is not a problem as most titles are short and dialogs are wide. 
So the solution here is either to shorten the title text or force the dialog to 
be wider using font relative sizing.
Both options should perhaps be used. 
Suggest changing the title to "Package Root Selection" and increasing the width 
of the ElementTreeSelectionDialog.

increased the standard wity of the ElementTreeSelectioDialog.
It is now the same as for the ElementListSelectioDialog, 60 characters.
