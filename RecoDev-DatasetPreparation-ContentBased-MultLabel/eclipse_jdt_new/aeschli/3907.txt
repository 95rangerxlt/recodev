what are the steps to reproduce this behaviour?
1. Open Type Hierarchy on "SearchResultView"
2. Press "Show the Type Hierarchy (Ctrl + 1)"
3. Select "ViewPart"
4. Press "Show the Supertype Hierarchy (Ctrl + 2)"
==> Selection switches to "SearchResultView"

Moving to Martin either for fixing or disposing. It seems that currently the
selections are not wired between the 3 views.

I would like to have the following:
When I switch from view A to view B and B has/had not yet a selection then try
to select the type which was selected before - select the first element in all
other cases.

by design the views keep their selection. So you can switch quickly to the 
subtypes view to look at something and return back to the supertypes view.

I agree that your approach is good to, but note that the only comon element in 
sub and superhierarchy is the root element. so for most cases you simply loose 
the selection anyway.

please reopen if you can't live with the current solution
