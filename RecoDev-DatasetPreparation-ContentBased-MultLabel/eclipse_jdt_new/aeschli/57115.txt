UserLibraryClasspathContainer.initialize(...) is setting the classpath 
container value to null, which causes it to be reinitialized each time (and 
thus it is being asked for a new value over and over again).

null is not a valid value. Moving to JDT UI for comments.

You're right, it was setting it to null when the library was unknown. No it 
only initializes when the library is known, otherwise it does nothing.
