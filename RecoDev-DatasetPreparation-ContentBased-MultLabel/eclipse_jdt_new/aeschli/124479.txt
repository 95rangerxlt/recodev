It would be helpful to be able to find out whether linking in the package explorer is enabled or not.  I wondered whether it might be possible to change the visibility of the isLinkingEnabled method on PackageExplorerPart to public?

PackageExplorerPart is not public API, I guess you are aware of that.

Why would you like to know if linking is enabled?
We have a problem in AJDT where linking doesn't work for .aj files.  This is because the object shown in the package explorer for a given file is not the same object that is the editor's input object.  I know that the package explorer is not public API and I realise that this is quite a specific use case, however I thought it might be worth asking since it's quite a small change and it would allow us to get linking working in a fairly clean way.  

It probably isn't relevant to this bug but I believe a full solution to bug 36939 would remove this problem.
It's in deed quite a small change
I added new API to IPackagesViewPart, similar to IResourceNavigator:

    boolean isLinkingEnabled();
    void setLinkingEnabled(boolean enabled);

note that IPackagesViewPart is public API
Thank you
