Build 20021001

When restarting Eclipse with a hierarchy view, it takes forever to come up, 
since the hierarchy computation is competing with the index consistency check 
on startup (mandatory prior to any search/hierarchy query).

Curiously, the hierarchy view is refreshed on startup, no matter if it is 
visible or not. Laziness would improve the behavior significantly here. 

Persisting hierarchies would likely also improve the behavior, but JDT/Core 
doesn't keep track of hierarchy objects... we could however provide an API to 
serialize out/back in a hierarchy object. But before following that last 
direction, I'd be interested in exploring other ways where laziness could 
improve the behavior already.

asking Martin for comment
workbench is about to release support for lazy view instantiation on start-up. 
This means when the type hierarchy isn't visible it will not be instantiated.

Further actions should wait until the workbench support is in the build and we 
have experimented with it.

type hierarchy is now only updated when visible. on startup the workbench also 
delays the part creation until it gets visible


Restoring hierarchy views
