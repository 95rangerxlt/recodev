I20031119 (M5 test pass)

1. Open ContextBasedFormattingStrategy.java (or another type of your liking)
2. Press Ctrl+T to open the type hierarchy
3. Repeatedly pressing Ctrl+T toggles between super- and subtype hierarchy

-> The caption of the affordance shown at the bottom needs to be swapped
Right now, when displaying the supertype hierarchy, it reads "Press Ctrl+T to
display the supertype hierarchy".
