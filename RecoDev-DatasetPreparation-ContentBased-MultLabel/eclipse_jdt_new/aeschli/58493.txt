I can define multiple user libraries, and add them to a project though build 
path. The compilation is ok. 
But when run or debug the project, only one libray's jars are in classpath. And 
not able to add user library in the Run-classpath window: click Advance, 
click "Add Library", select "User Library", click OK, nothing happended.

Platform:
Windows 2000, Sun JDK1.4.2_03, Eclipse 3.0 M8 
Windows XP, Sun JDK1.4.1_xx, Eclipse 3.0 M8
