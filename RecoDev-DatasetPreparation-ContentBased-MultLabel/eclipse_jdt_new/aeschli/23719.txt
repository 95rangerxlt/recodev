When generating getter and setter methods for a boolean member "isFoo", Eclipse 
generates a method "isFoo" and a method "setIsFoo". Many applications working 
with bean introspection will not be able to detect this as the same property. 
Eclipse should either generate "isIsFoo"/"setIsFoo" or "isFoo"/"setFoo".
