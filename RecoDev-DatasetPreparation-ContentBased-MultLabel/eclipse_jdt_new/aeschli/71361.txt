In "Organize Imports" it's possible to configure order of imports. That's fine
and useful, however I believe its usability could be greatly enhanced by
providing two general entries:
- Application
- Non-JDK libraries

Default Eclipse's way of organizing imports is:
- JDK packages
- non-JDK libraries
- application classes

while I'd like to be able to organize them in order:
- application classes
- non-JDK libraries
- JDK packages

With these two entries it would be possible to do so easily.

Currently it's impossible because if I work on one project, it's the
'application' I work on, while when working on another project which uses code
from the first, it's a 'non-JDK library'. So putting strict order as currently
supported is not a solution.

Another solution would be to don't add any special entries but make it
configurable per-project.
oganize import settings per project are likely to come for 3.1
organize import settings are now per project (in M4)

No plans to introduce general settings like 'Application' , 'Non-JDK-library'
(Note that we don't really have this information. We know what a JDK is, but
nothing else)


"Organize Imports" dialog should have entries for application and non-standard libraries
