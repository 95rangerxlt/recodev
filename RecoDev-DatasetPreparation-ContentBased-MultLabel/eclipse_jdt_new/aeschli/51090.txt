Java Development User Guide>Concepts>Quick Fix
has a section on quick assists at the end. There's
a typo in the penultimate line ("rename" is duplicated).
Also, "There is no light bulb shown so the user has
to know the available assists." is not quite right;
it should mention that there is an option in
Window>Preferences>Java>Work in Progess>Quick Assist
to enable light bulbs for quick assists.

fixed the duplicated 'rename'.
We will update the doc to contain the 'quick assist light bulb' for 3.0 just
before the release. 
The duplicate "rename" has been removed, but the sentence about quick assist
light bulbs still doesn't mention the option to enable the light bulb (which has
moved to Window>Preferences>Java>Editor>Appearance in the meantime).
3.1M4 (Version: 3.1.0, Build id: 200412162000)

fixed > 20050131

Note that there was bigger doc update for 3.0. Help is welcome here.
