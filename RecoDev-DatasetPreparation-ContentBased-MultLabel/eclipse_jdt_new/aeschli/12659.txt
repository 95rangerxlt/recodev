If you add a new source folder to the build path (I prefer to just add it using
the new "Source Folder" action from the packages view), it gets added to the end
of the classpath.  If I am creating a new source folder I want it to be with the
other source folders at the beginning of the classpath so that it comes before
the libraries.

This works if I go in through the Java project properties and add a source 
folder there, but if I add a source folder using Java Project->Right click->new-
>source folder it has the old behaviour.
