How to recreate:

1.  Add the default JUnit 4 library included with Eclipse
2.  Set the Javadoc reference manually to http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc_40/
3.  Close the Eclipse IDE.
4.  Launch the Eclipse IDE.

The previously set Javadoc reference will be gone.  It must be set for every launch of the Eclipse IDE.

This is also known to affect Eclipse 3.2.1.

If one adds a User Library for JUnit (say to install JUnit 4.2 for example), the User Library remembers its Javadoc settings just fine.
