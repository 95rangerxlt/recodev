I could be nice to have the ability to re-format all Java files in one time. 
Beyond, to do all java file based actions on a selection of files (as for 
search for example).

agreed, that this would be nice, but we cannot commit to it for 2.0
[code manipulation]

Should consider for 2.1

I voted for this Bug/Request since we have some large projects. The main 
project currently has over 2300 classes. We like to have the same format for 
all sources. We could do a format every time we hit a source, but our sources 
are under control of CVS and a mailing system keep al developers up-to-date 
with changes. Doing a logical code change and a source format on a few files at 
the time will clutter the changes.
With the ability to format all sources at once, we can commit all source 
formats at once, while disabling the mailing system during this commit.

Chaning state from assigned later to resolved later. Assigned later got 
introduced by the last bug conversion and is not a supported Eclipse bug state.

Although though it would still be nice to have code formatting for multiple 
files integrated in Eclipse, I have found an alternative some time ago:

Plugin that provides functionality we are asking for

This is the formatjava plugin that allows for recursive formatting of a source
tree that has been available for over a year now. Hopefully the development
team can just add this to the 3.0 stream as it doesn't seem to be a hard task
at all. The functionality (formatting) is already there, we just need a menu
option to recursively apply it to all the files in a tree.

PLEASE reopen this bug for 3.0
Reopening for 3.0 consideration.
Silvio, can you please investigate. You should coordinate this with Martin 
since the algorithm should be comparable to apply organize imports to folders, 
projects as well.

What is the status of this?  We want to reformat all of the runtime/OSGi code 
for 3.0 and would prefer not to wait until the last minute.  If this bug will 
be fixed in the next week or two we'll wait.  Otherwise we'll hire a crew of 
monkeys.

A version of the original plugin that works with 3.0

This is a new version of the original code that has been updated to work with
Eclipse 3.0.  It still uses the obsolete formatter API but it gets the job
done.

formatjava project zip

This is an updated version of the formatjava plugin project.  The previous one
I posted had a number of problems.  In particular, the plugin.xml was incorrect
and code acutally used the old formatter.  This one uses the new formatter and
the current formatting settings.
This still says target milestone 3.0, so will this contribution make it in?
unfortunately not - we have to focus on delivering what we currently have in 
product quality - adjusted the milestone
discussed with Martin again - reconsider for 3.0
the format action is now also enabled in the Java views (on CU's, package 
fragments, source folders and projects)
