I had to disable the buttons as I would have to show a tree of packages and 
type of a classpath entry not yet on the classpath.

Javamodel requires a package fragment root to exists. New funtionality from 
jdt.core would be required.
Note that we have a similar wish to be able to offer a more help full new Java 
project wizard that shows previews of the Java structure with a given 
classpath (e.g. to test the source folder in- exclusions)
filed bug 77375 as feature request for jdt.core
You should remove that button for M3: a disabled button gives the impression
that I have the chance to enable it somehow.
