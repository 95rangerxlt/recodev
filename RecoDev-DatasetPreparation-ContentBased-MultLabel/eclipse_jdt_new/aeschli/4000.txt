	1) in the startup of a plugin that contributes a IVMInstallType, call JavaRuntime.getVMInstallTypes
	2) open the Installed JRE's preference page
	3) now the initializeVMInstalls() method on JavaRuntime is called
	4) this executes the startup method
	5) the getVMInstallTypes() call from the startup method executes initializeVMInstalls() again.
	6) the initialization is executed twice, possibly overwriting results of the first initialization.
