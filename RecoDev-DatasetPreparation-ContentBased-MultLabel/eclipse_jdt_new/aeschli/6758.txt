Build 20011206

- opened org.eclipse.ui.actions.DeleteResourceAction
- using new class wizard, created member class named DeleteProjectDialog as a 
subclass of MessageDialog (in org.eclipse.jface.dialogs)
- the result was:
...
public class DeleteRes	ourceAction extends SelectionListenerAction {

		public class
 DeleteProjectDialog extends MessageDialog {

}
...

Note the extra tab in DeleteResourceAction, and the strange formatting for the 
new class.
