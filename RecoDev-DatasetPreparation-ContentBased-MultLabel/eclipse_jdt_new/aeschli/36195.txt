For code generation in the preferences | java | code generation | code and comments 
in case of exception there seems to be available only: 
 
date, dollar, exception_type, exception_var, time, todo, user, year 
 
Is it possible to make the enclosing method name accessible the exception is generated 
in? 
 
Thanks

Thanks for reporting this. Unfortunately, it was assigned to the Scripting
component, which seems not to be tracked by anybody. Moving to JDT for comment.
What if the code is not in a method but an initialzier?
Would it be good enough to get the parent type?
