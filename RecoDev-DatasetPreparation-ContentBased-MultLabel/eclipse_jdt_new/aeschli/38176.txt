2.1

In the source for InternalPlatform, I added a field: boolean noVersionCheck.
Elsewhere in the code, I made reference to it but got the casing wrong in an 
assignment: noversioncheck = false.

Clicking on the light bulb gave me some suggestions, but the suggestion for 
noVersionCheck was far down the list.  It would be nice if it checked for 
simple case mismatches.

The list also included some static final fields, which can't be assigned to.

Only differing on case gives now extra relevance.
There is also a fix that final fields are not suggested when the field is write
accessed.
