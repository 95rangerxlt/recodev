In order to make Javadoc better integrated w/ E, it would be great to have a a
linked Javadoc output view. Instead of Javadoc output going to "Console" it
would go to a "Javadoc" view where:

o You can run and re-run the same Javadoc command as specified in an initial
"Export..."
o Javadoc warnings and errors can be clicked on like hyper-links.

Thank you for considering this request.

Seems to me to be too much to have an own view that would be very similar to the
cosole. But the console view should be able to hyper-link the Javadoc error
output. Maybe it could even offer a rerun?

Mobing to debug. Please move it back if there is already a way how I can
contribute the Javadoc error parsing to the console view.

You should be able to handle javadoc error parsing with the current support in 
the console. You launch an OS process to do the javadoc. You should registere 
the process with a type (such as "javadoc"). Currently we have types 
like "java" and "ant" (via IProcess.ATTR_PROCESS_TYPE) - you register the 
process type in the process attribute map.

You can then register to listen to console output (IConsoleLineTracker) for a 
specific process type. Your listener is notified of each line of output as it 
is added to the console - you can then add hyperlinks as appropriate to the 
console - IConsole.addLink(...).

See examples by browsing impementors of IConsoleLineTracker. This is how stack 
trace hyperlinks and javac error output hyperlinks are created.

In addition to this *much* anticipated (at least here;) feature, it would be
great if the output could be filtered based on source-file and error-type:
warning/error...
