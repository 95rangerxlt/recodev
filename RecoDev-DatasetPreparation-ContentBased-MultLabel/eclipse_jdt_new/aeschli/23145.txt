Stream 2.1

As a consequence of bug 6976, new JavaCore options were made available to 
control the TODO tasks collection.

Note that some quickfix support would be necessary in order to allow removing 
such tasks automatically from the task view (see 6976 for suggestions).

============
Compiler can now optionally collect TODO tasks from the source code. 
Occurrences of a TODO tag are looked for inside any type of comments, and 
reported along with problems. 
New problem ID got created: org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.IProblem#ToDo. 
JavaCore option added to control the severity of TODO reports 
(ignore/warning/error). 
* COMPILER / Reporting occurrences of TODO tags in comments
*    When enabled, the compiler will issue an error or a warning whenever it 
encounters
*    a TODO tag inside any comment. The tag value itself is defined by the 
option
*    "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.todoTag".
*     - option id:		
	"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.todo"
*     - possible values:	{ "error", "warning", "ignore" }
*     - default:			"warning"

JavaCore option added for specifying the TODO tag value (default is "TODO:"). 
* COMPILER / Define the TODO task tag
*    Define the tag used to recognize TODO tasks in comments.
*     - option id:		
	"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.todoTag"
*     - possible values:	"" where  is a non-empty string, without any 
wild-card.
*     - default:			"TODO:"

My suggestion was that any time a method stub is inserted, a @todo tag should 
get inserted, so:

new MouseAdapter(<<CODE ASSIST>>){
  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e){
    //@TODO implement mousePressed
  }
  public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e){
    //@TODO implement mouseReleased
  }
}


When "overrideMethod" feature is changed so that it inserts new methods in 
correct alphabetic order, methods will be interlaced throughout an existing 
CU.  The new @todo function will make it easier to track and visit each of the 
inserted skeletons.

the priority seems to be wrong.

if i sort the task on priority then "TODO" markers come before error markers.
(it would be nice to make the priority of markers customizeable)

Those markers what are they? Because if i look into the taks i still see 
error, info and warning. But those markers are none of them?
another thing, Can the markers red squire in the overview ruler be a different 
color? Now i always think they are compile errors that can be solved with 
quickfix (hollow red squires)

Extra markers should have a different squire, like green?
Please file separated bug reports. The image and problem underlining color is a 
JDT-UI/Text request. Task priority is for JDT Core.

Thanks a lot.
