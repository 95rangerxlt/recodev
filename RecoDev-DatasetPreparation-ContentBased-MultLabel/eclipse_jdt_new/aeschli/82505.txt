I see now two problems connected with search in M4. (Sorry if it is a
duplication, I just did not find anything like that).
1) If I try search (Ctrl-H) using working set, it just doesn't find anything.
This happens not with each working set I defined. For example I created working
set(Java) that contained two plugins: org.eclipse.cdt.core (with source files)
and org.eclipse.emf.doc.user,  search for IResourse (search for type, limit for
references) didn't work at all. If I removed doc.user plugin from the working
set, the same search worked well. If then I instead of doc.user plugin I
inserted plugin org.eclipse.emf.org, it failed to search IResource once again. I
know, that "doc" plugin is not supposed to contain anything useful from the
search point of view. But I could create working set with this plugin for
whatever reason and then might used it to limit search and should always failed.
Actually, I ran into this problem and spent a while to find the workaround, so I
gues it is better not to have this problem at all.
2) Working set list in References (JavaEdit pulldown menu) is barely
synchronised with existing working sets. Moreover, after creating, then
deleting, then re-creating working set named "cdt", I got two "cdt" working sets
in the References list (see attached image).
