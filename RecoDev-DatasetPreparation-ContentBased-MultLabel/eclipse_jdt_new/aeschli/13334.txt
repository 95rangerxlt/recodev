- projects have an entry 'Javadoc location' in their property editor.
- jar files don't have this entry because setting their javadoc location
  is specified in the 'Source attachment' page

this is inconsistent. 

I would suggest to either
- split the source attachment into two pages, one for source and one for javadoc
or
- to rename the page 'Java Source Attachment' to 'Java Source/Doc Attachment'
  (in this case 'Javadoc location' should be renamed to 'Java Doc Attachment'

Javadoc: for jar files javadoc attachment is hidden in source attachment
