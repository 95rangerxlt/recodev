I wanted to use quickfix on missing FileNamefilter import problem, but import 
was not one of the options.

I'll attach a picture.

Shows that import option is missing from quickfix
There where problems with the search infrastructure which got addressed for 2.1 
which verly likely cause this problem. Can you try to reproduce the problem 
with the upcoming RC1 build. I assume that the FilenameFilter class is on the 
build path ;-)).
This will reproduce the problem.

I'll certainly download RC1, but it is perhaps easier to just check this now to 
be done with it.


public class Foo
{
	public void main(String[] xx)
	{
		FilenameFilter t=new FilenameFilter(){};
		
	}
}
