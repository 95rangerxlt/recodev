Build 2.1 RC1

The "Code Generation" - "Code and Comments" preference page has a strange mix of
icons:
public type
public constructor
protected method

How can I specify the comment for public method?

Since these icons stand the member type we must use a generic icon. The same
problem was detected for Members Sort Order pref page and has already been fixed
by using the public icon for all member types.

Opt to use the public icon in all cases.
I'd rather remove the icons alltogether.
