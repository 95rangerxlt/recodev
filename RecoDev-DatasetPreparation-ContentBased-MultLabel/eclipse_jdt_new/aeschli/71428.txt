In the packages view, open an editor on a type that is deep down in a 
hierarchy. (I opened type Table in the org.eclipse.swt project).
(I also happened to have an editor open on the ImageData type in the same 
poject - you will need two editors open to change the active editor).

Now decide that you prefer to work in the hierarchy view for the project, so 
for example, select org.eclipse.swt and say 'Open Type Hierarchy'.

In the Type Hierarchy View menu, select 'Link With Editor'.

I would expect at this point that the active editor would be shown in the type 
hierarchy view, but it is not.

Just to be sure that it wasn't just an activation event missing, I clicked on 
the other editor (ImageData) and noticed that it was shown in the type 
hierarchy. Then I clicked back on Table, but it still was not linked with the 
type hierarchy view. This seems to be because the type hierarchy has not yet 
been expanded to the level needed to show Table.java. I can expand down to the 
correct level and then the 'link' feature works correctly. However I expected 
the view to do the initial expansion for free.

This the package explorer does the expansion the type hierarchy view should do 
the same. May be this is a "performance problem" because this may require 
building lots of sub type hierarchies.

Markus, can you please comment.
What we have to prevent is that selecting an element would not try to internaly
expand the whole tree (this would be too expensive for Object).
Looking at the implementation of AbstractTreeViewer.internalExpand this is not
the case anyways, so I will try this.
Note that not all hierarchies can implement contentProvider.getParent. So there
will always be the case that elements stay hidden (as they can't be found)
