Just to understand, are you saying that if a file is readonly, then quickfix 
won't suggest a fix, but if the same file is made writeable it will suggest?
Yes
How can someone get the Rational folks (who own the cc plugin) to look at this?
Where do people log bugs/enhancements for the Eclipse ClearCase plugin? 
I'm guessing that the plugins do not require changes. The
mechanisms involved must be the same as with refactoring.
Based on my question in comment #1 and the answer in comment #2, I am 
assigning this back to JDT core for investigation.

It seems that JDT is balking on the quick fix when they discover the file is 
read-only, which for pessimistic providers is a normal state for a file to be 
in.

This is really easy to reproduce:  

1. create a java file that has a quick-fix'able error
2. observe you can get the quickfix suggestions
3. change the property of the file to read-only
4  check quick fix -- no suggestions.
Martin, how difficult would it be to perform a validate edit on the resources 
to be changed. There is a helper class that can be used to perform this.
