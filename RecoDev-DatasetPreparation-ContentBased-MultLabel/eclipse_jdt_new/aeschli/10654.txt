When adding jar files to the build path using classpath variables, you have to 
specify each jar file separately, even if there are several in the same 
directory. It would be useful if you could use a classpath variable to point to 
the whole directory, so that all jar files in that directory are added to the 
build path.
This would be analogous to the installed extensions feature of the java launcher 
- you can specify the system property java.ext.dirs to point to a list of 
directories containing jar files to be automatically added to the classpath.
This feature suggested itself to me after using a class contained in the 
WebSphere Test Environment plugin (in WSAD4.0). In order to get my code to 
compile, I had to add in several of the jar files from the WTE plugin directory. 
This involved manually searching through the jar files to find the missing 
classes, and adding in the appropriate jars.
I believe bug #3887 alludes to this feature (saying it will be deferred), but I 
haven't been able to find a bug report or feature request directly describing 
this.

Extension dir feature request
Add JARs from extension dirs is straightforward when you don't use class path 
variables. The UI supports a multiple selection in the dialog. However, this is 
not the case when you use class path variables.

We could support a multiple selection in Path-Extension Browse dialog as well.

new dialog for variable classpath entries allows to add multiple entries to the 
classpath
