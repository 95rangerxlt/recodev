Build RC1

When locking on a given method, occurrences of such a method are always listed 
behind subtypes, which is causing the end result to be quite hard to decode:

Instead of:
A
+- foo()
+- B
   +- foo()
   +- C
      +- foo()

It currently displays:

A
+- B
|  +- C
|  |  +- foo()
|  +- foo()
+- foo()

which goes backwards, when multiple sibling subtypes exist, the end result is 
even worse.

When saying it goes backwards, I mean that naturally a superclass is listed 
above a type, but a super method is listed below !?!?
Philippe, the "only" difference between the two structures is the ordering 
of "children". In the first we show subclasses before method in the second 
methods before subclasses.
I understand, all I am arguing is that the end result isn't that intuitive. 
Super methods should always appear above a method, and not below.
Time permitted for RC2.

Martin, what do you think about this.
makes sense, I will change it.
Here is the PR.
