Please add a Types/Source/Organize Imports menu item and make sure it is enabled
when _multiple_ types are selected. We use this nice feature all the time but
this would make it easier to use. Thanks.

The reason not having this on types is that a type doesn't have import 
statements. They belong to the compilation unit and organize import always 
works on the whole CU. The only thing we can offer is doing a organize import 
for the CU when activated on a type.

Martin, any comments.
It sounds to me like a subtle distinction internal to eclipse. Just to make 
myself clear. I am talking about the Java Browsing Perspective, Types pane 
with a class or interface selected. So I do not understand the statement: 

"The reason not having this on types is that a type doesn't have import 
statements."

Thanks,gg.
Martin, can you please comment.
makes sense to have 'organize imports' in the browsing perspective. So for me it
would be fine to enable 'organize imports' also on types.
