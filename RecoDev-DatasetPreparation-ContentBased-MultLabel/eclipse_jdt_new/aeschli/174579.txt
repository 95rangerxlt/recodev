The at symbol behaves oddly in java code templates (Preferences -> Java Code Style -> Code Templates).  All text after the "at symbol" does not appear when the code template is instantiated.  Specifically I attempted to use the "New Java Files" code template with the following body, to annotate the class with it's CVS revision.

${filecomment}
${package_declaration}

import xxx.Revision;

${typecomment}
@Revision(value = "$$Revision$$")
${type_declaration}

When creating a new java file, the line @Revision simply does not appear at all.  The characters '$', '\' and '@' are all ineffective at escaping the at symbol, some explanation or workaround would be appreciated.
