Steps to reproduce (Eclipse3.0M8):
Create a project with any name;
Create some classes there;
Execute Export->Javadoc. In the wizard, in the destination editbox, type any 
name that contains spaces. 
If the spaces are only in the last segment of the path (say, c:\tmp\my 
project), the javadoc is just generated in the incorrect (truncated) location 
(in this example, c:\tmp\my). 

If there are spaces before the last segment (e.g., c:\Documents and 
Settings\user\My Documents\my project), generation only produces 2 empty 
folders (in this example, C:\Documents and the destination that was typed) and 
fails to do anything else.

Also, spaces in the path of libraries referenced by the project are treated as 
command line separators.

E.g. if the project references the two Jar-Archives
C:\Java XML\dom.jar and
C:\Java XML\sax.jar,
executing the Javadoc wizard produces the following error output:

javadoc: Illegal package name: "XML\dom.jar;C:\Java"
javadoc: Illegal package name: "XML\sax.jar"

Martin, can you please comment.
