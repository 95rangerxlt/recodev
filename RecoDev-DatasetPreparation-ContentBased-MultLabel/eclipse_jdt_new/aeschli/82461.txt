Adding a MarkerAnnotation ast node to a method declaration with visibility 
modifiers results in unconventional formatting of the modifier ast node list.

Example:

public int foo();

Adding marker annotation @Override results in:

@Override public int foo();

The formatting should be:

@Override
public int foo();

Where did you get that the annotation must be on its own line?
This is from an 1.5 JDK:

@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)
public @interface Override {

}

Other annotations in java.lang are formatted like this as well

The fact that annotations and modifiers internally both are IExtendedModifiers 
is a technical detail which should not be reflected in the formatting of 
annotations.
And what are you doing if you have this:
public @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE) static
@interface Override {
}
?
We insert annotations always at the beginning of the list, like in 1.5 JDKs.

In the above case, we probably should leave the formatting as it is. However, 
if the extended modifier list is partitioned into an annotation part followed 
by a modifier part (which is almost always the case), the formatting should 
follow the JDK formatting conventions.
