When using the Add Import... editor context menu item inner classes are offered as potential 
choices even though they don't make sense in context.

Using Source->Organize Imports works as expected and imports java.util.ArrayList

Here is an example;

1) Add this code to a new class and save
2) Double Click on the unknown type ArrayList and invoke 'Source->Add Import'
3) Notice that both java.uti.ArrayList and java.util.Arrays.ArrayList are presented as choices.

import java.util.List;

public class HelloWorld {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List myHellos = new ArrayList();
		HelloProvider hp = new HelloProvider();
		WorldProvider wp = new WorldProvider();
		String hello = hp.getHello();
		String world = wp.getWorld();
		System.out.println(hello + " " + world);
	}
}

Move to JDT/UI.
Would like to implement that but jdt.core misses the required API. see bug 36896
[Problem not Mac specific. Setting Platform/OS to "All"]
Martin, bug 36896 got fixed.
That has been fixed for M7. Private types are now ignored.


Add Import... menu item provides inner class options and should not [code manipulaiton]
