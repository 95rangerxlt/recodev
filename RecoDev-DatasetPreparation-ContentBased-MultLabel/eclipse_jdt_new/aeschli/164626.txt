Add the ALT+Shift+W (Show in...) on the right click menu on any file, not just the java ones. Note that the keyboard shortcut already exists on any type of file, it's just not mapped onto the right-click menu.

It may be noted that the right click menu that I'm referring to is the one that is shown when you click the content of a file in an editor, not the menu for the file icon displayed in various Navigators.
Do you mean 'In all views not just the Java editor and the serahc view'?
Maybe give an example where you miss 'Show In' the most.


Yes I mean something like that. All views, not just the Java Editor.

For example, it would nice to have the "Show in..." for .jsp, .html, .sql pages etc.

Java views now all contain the 'Show In' menu

If you are missing  'Show In..' in Editors other than the Java editor, file bug reports against the corresponding component: Web Tooling for jsp and html
