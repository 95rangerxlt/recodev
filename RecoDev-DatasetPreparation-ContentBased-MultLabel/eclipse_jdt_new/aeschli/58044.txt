I've been experimenting on how the Javadoc location is defined to find a good 
approach for how extendable plug-ins can package doc when they choose not to 
ship source.

I've been using the Javadoc location Properties Page to point to where it could 
be found, but I get very confused when I select Validate.  

The "it works" and "it does not work" dialogs are almost identical. They both 
seem to be information dialogs and the wording is very similar.  At a glance 
you keep thinking it is wrong even when it is right.

Could you use a warning or error dialog when it is in fact wrong?  Then your 
eyes will tell you right away.

I changed the validator dialog to show a warning when the detection failed.
I hope that's good enough. 'Error' is too strong, it would look like something
creahsed.

Warning is perfect - I had thought about this a bit after reporting, and 
warning is correct as it could work later once the target resource shows up.


Javadoc location feedback is not precise [build path]
