in the history dialog, the 'Remove' button is
enabled when nothing is selected and
disabled when everything is selected

both are wrong
this bug is a twin of bug 41500 (i don't know if the same code is used in both 
or one copies from the other)

Fix for the enablement problem

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.typehierarchy.HistoryListAction
fixing the enablement problem when no elements are selected. When everything is

selected, the Remove button should not be enabled IMHO, since this would
prevent the user from exiting the dialog with anything but Cancel.

Also see my comments on #41500.

Thanks!
