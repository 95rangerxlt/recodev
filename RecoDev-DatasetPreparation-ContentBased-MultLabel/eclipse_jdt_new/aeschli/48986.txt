Edit > Quick Fix at the specified position doesn't show the 'Change then

That's unfortunate, since my standard usage pattern for the QuickFix is this: I
want to add a second statement to an 'if' clause, but before adding it, I see
that I need to have a block for it. In that case, my caret is already at the
position I where want to add a statement.

The QuickFix should also be active if the caret is after the then statement.
After applying the QuickFix, the caret should be at the previous position (after
the existing then statement.
