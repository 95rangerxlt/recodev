With at least 2 open projects in you workspace, click in the Package Explorer and hit Ctrl+A to select all projects. Most of the time, "Close Project" is shown. Under the circumstance that *no* project is selected before, pressing Ctrl+A causes the "Close Project" to be hidden.

Sorry, this should go to "JDT/UI" because it's the package explorer, not the Navigator. Navigator itself has no Select All feature (see Bug 51574)
Martin, it looks like the fix for bug 77067 does not send the correct viewer selection events.

I guess it would be better if the action only worked on the viewer level and not on the Tree widget (i.e., use AbstractTreeViewer#getExpandedElements() and select roots, expanded elements, and their children).

Otherwise, you would have to fake selection events to make sure that actions listening on viewer selection changes get updated (something like tree.notifyListeners(SWT.Selection, event) could help).
this works in 20070430

I think the fix of this of bug 165302 solved this
