HEAD from JDT/Core (not integrated yet)

Added JavaCore optional problem to detect incompatible required binaries, so as 
to flag situations where some prerequisite binaries are required a JRE level 
higher than the project target platform; i.e. compiling against 1.4 libraries 
when deploying for 1.1 platform is likely unwanted. 
* JAVACORE / Reporting Incompatible JDK Level for Required Binaries
*    Indicate the severity of the problem reported when a project prerequisites 
another project 
*    or library with an incompatible target JDK level (e.g. project targeting 
1.1 vm, but compiled against 1.4 libraries).
*     - option id:         "org.eclipse.jdt.core.incompatibleJDKLevel"
*     - possible values:   { "error", "warning", "ignore" }
*     - default:           "ignore"

proposed patch

Unsure about the mnemonic in introduced message
For consistency reason, the message catalog entry should probably read

pb_check_prereq_binary_level

instead of 
codegen_check_prereq_binary_level
great, thanks. will release as soon as possible (after the next integration
build when we get the new jdt.core congtaining the new preference key)
It is already in HEAD
