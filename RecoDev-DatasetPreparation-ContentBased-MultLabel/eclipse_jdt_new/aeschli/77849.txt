Currently, new java projects default to 1.4 compliance. In order to develop 
1.5 projects, the JRE container has to be changed, and the compiler compliance 
as well, but at two different places in the project properties.
The new project wizard already offers a page to choose the JRE container. The 
compiler compliance however has to be set manually in the project properties 
afterwards. For consistency, compiler compliance should be configurable in the 
wizard too, possibly with a warning when using incompatible configurations 
(like 1.4 compiler compliance and 1.5 JRE, but not vice-versa)

+1.

Martin, what do you think ? May be Erol can help out here.
good idea. Changing both at the same time might be difficult unless we can 
find out from a JDK that it is 1.5.
A simple thing would be to have a link on the build path wizard to the 
compiler property page. Or, having the compiler properties as a page in the 
wizard.
I want to see in what direction we go with preferences, so but would be better 
to not rush. Splitting up the compiler preference page ect is planed

added a dialog to ask if the compliance settings should be changed to 5.0
