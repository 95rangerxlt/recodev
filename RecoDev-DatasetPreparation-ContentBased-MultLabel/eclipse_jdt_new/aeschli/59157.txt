the time would be the same as the previous time) is remembered for the next

The new exteneralize string wizard (a first cut will be in todays integration 
build) uses a probing mechanism to detect the correct settings from the CU you 
are working on.

Hoewever for new files we should remember the old values.
now i use ibuild I20040514 i see that we can configure the accessor class and 
the properties file. So i thought that because of the "Configure" the values 
would be stored now.. but i have to still configure it every time :(
Martin, can you please have a look. For new CUs we should allow using the 
previous used values for the properties file and the accessor class.
What are exactly "new CU" in this perspective?
A CU for which i ask the Externalize Dialog up for the first time??

What i would expect is that the last time i used the dialog the value is stored 
in the preferences for that project the CU is in.. And then the next time i 
open a CU it sees that it doesn't have already a value for that (i don't know 
where you store this) then it looks at the projects value and then it generates 
the default value if the project doesn't have a value yet (This only happens 
the first time i do this for the first CU of a project)
we have a message bundle per package. So having remember the one used the last
time in the project would give us more work.
The current solution of just going to a default accessor ('messages') isn't the
most clever one, but seems not bad to me. 
in my eyes it is bad.
Because you only have one default accessor per project (and it could be that 
that one is also used over more projects as i have)

so if i am doing my work in the project for every package i have to change 2 
packages one for the Messages class and one for the properties file.
It's even getting worser when i am in a second project that also uses the first 
project as its messages base... Then i have to change for every file i enter 4 
things.. 2x choose the project and 2 times the package.

If it is to much work for now to store it at project basis. Then i would vote 
now that you don't store it at all. But just keep the last settings. Never 
change the value of the messages class and the projecties file for the 
Externalize Strings dialog. 
Only check one time if the values are set. If not then do what you do now. If 
the values are set then do not change it. Then i believe that in 99% of the 
cases people can do there job.

Created attachment 13048
suggested fix for 3.0.1
released for the 3.1 stream:
wizard page offers a combo to also select previously used accessor
class/property file


reopen as 3.0.1 candidate
Also see bug 69802.
This fix will not make it into 3.0.1. Code change is to big and bug not 
critical.

Changing milestone to M2 so that we can verify it.
