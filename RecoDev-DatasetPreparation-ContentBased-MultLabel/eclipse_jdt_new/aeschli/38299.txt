Even on my 1.8 GHz powered 500MB RAM machine the external online help needs up to five 
seconds to open when pressing SHIFT-F2 on a source line. Would be great to have visual 
feedback of the status, e.g. by showing a wait cursor instead of the mouse cursor.

Martin, 

are we responsible to show the busy cursor or is this something Help should 
do ?
