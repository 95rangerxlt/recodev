disable quickfix for overridden methods

Martin, this little patch(y) only adds a quickfix to rethrow the exception if we are not in an overridden method.
In general quick fix should be allowed to introduce such errors. Your next step could be to add an exception to 'run' (if that's in source)

updated patch

Martin, I updated the patch to only ignore the quick fix if we cannot modify the overridden compilation unit. Hope this was your intention.

[quick fix] Shouldn't offer "Add throws declaration" quickfix for overriding signature if result would conflict with overridden signature.
