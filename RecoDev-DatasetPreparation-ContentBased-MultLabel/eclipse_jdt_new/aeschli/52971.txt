I'm using 3.0M7 GTK on X4.3, Kernel 2.6.3.

When I select a field, and use the context menu's Source->Generate Delegate
Methods...

and select some method, the generated method does not have the field qualified
with 'this.', even though I have that preference set in
Preferences->Code Generation->Names->Qualify all generated field accesses with
'this.'

I'll attach my preferences and a snapshot of the preferences panel in the next
comments.
