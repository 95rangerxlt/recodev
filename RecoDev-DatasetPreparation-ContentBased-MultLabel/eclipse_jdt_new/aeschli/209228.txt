Good patch (got applied to I20071113-0800).

We should replace the fSpecialAnnotationTypes with a new result type that can hold a position. This is cleaner and faster.

Letting matcher return a Position is not 100% correct (IRegion would be a better fit) but I think it's OK as we later use a Position and hence create less objects.
