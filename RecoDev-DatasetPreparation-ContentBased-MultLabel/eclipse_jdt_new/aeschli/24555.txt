Build 20021008

Currently, there is no way to see qualified type names in a hierarchy view. 
This is painful, since the only alternative is to select each of them and look 
into the status bar.

There should be a toggle button allowing me to see fully qualified names 
(likely the package name would be appended behind the simply name: e.g. Object -
 java.lang).

Also, I should be able to restrain the presented information to a certain 
package (after the fact).

Probably, better than restraining to a certain package, I should be able to 
restrain to a given working set.
Another alternative I'd like to see is to have a tooltip display the fully
qualified type. The reason is because the horizontal space I have allocated to
the left-hand view (where the type hierarchy is displayed) is often very narrow,
in order to leave more room for other parts of the window. The tooltip could
overlap into the editor part, allowin g one to quickly see all the types without
having to expand the view.
added new action to the view-menu: Show qualified type names

Hierarchy view should offer showing qualified type names
