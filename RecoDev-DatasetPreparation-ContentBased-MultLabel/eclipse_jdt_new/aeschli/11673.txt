Workbench->Preferences->Java->Compiler

1) Start with the default settings
2) Change "Unused local variables" to "Warning"
3) Hit Apply button
4) Dialog shows up asking if user wants a full rebuild
5) Hit Cancel to exit yes/no dialog
6) Hit cancel to exit preferences
7) Go back to the same preferences page
8) "Unused local variables" was set to "Warning"

The expected behaviour was to cancel the dialog (none of the options) and 
cancel the preferences without modifying anything. It seems that ESC is the 
same as hitting NO in that dialog.
