In the "Attachments for <jar>" dialog (from Project->Properties->Java Build
Path->Libraries tab->Attach Source) there is a "Browse Workspace..." button. 
When I click that I get an "Archive Selection" dialog.  This dialog should
default to the container that the jar is located in so that I don't have to hunt
throughout the entire workspace for the source (which is most often very near
the jar).

works for me (20020510)
In a eclipse dev. workspace, select workbench.jar, source attchement property 
page, browse workspace, workbenchsrc.jar is selected.

Please reopen if you have a reproduceable case.


If source is already attached this is not an issue (the correct zip is 
highlighted).  When source in not already attached, the selection defaults to 
the first project.

In a Eclipse dev project try removing the source attachment on the 
workbench.jar.  Then click the "Browse workspace..." button again.  The first 
project will be selected, now you have to hunt for your jar & appropriate 
source.
oh, I see.
