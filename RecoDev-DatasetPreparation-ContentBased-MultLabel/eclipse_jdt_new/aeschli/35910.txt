Build R2.1

As soon as some problem is reported against a parameter, the quickfix for 
renaming parameter is gone (I am in the middle of adding support for parameter 
hiding existing field/enclosing variable), and quickfix support is gone for 
these (where it would actually be the right quickfix).

Is it supposed to be only the default quickfix ? I think it is always a useful 
thing to have, no matter if another problem is logged against the parameter.

currently the quick assist do not show up if there is an error around the 
location.
we should look at this again.
- when quick fix finds a error on the same line and changes the cursor position 
to it: no quick assist
- else, show merge of quick asists and quick fixes
