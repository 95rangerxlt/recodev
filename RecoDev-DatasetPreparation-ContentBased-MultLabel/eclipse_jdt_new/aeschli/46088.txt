When you write the following code

  Bla var = getMyBla();

and press Ctrl-1, you can have the method "getMyBla" created. However, if the 
type Bla is not (yet) known, the method gets declared as

  private Object getMyBla() {
    ...
  }

If you press Ctrl-1 again, the import for Bla is added. If the order of the two 
quickfixes was reversed, you'd get the correct method declaration.
