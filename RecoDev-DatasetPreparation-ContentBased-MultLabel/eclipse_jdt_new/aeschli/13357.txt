public class A {
	public void f() {
		int fred= 0;
		int bozo= 0;
		me(fred, bozo);
	}
}

it does let me create a method me with 2 int parameters
but it could do better on parameter names - just take the 2 given

(not possible in general case when i call:
me(anotherMethod(), bozo)
)

now the names used in the method invocation are taken.


quick fix: could maybe be smarter on param names
