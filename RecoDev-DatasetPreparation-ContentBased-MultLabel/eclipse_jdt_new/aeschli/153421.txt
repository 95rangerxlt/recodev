R3.2 and I20060810-0010 

* Workspace default JRE is jdk1.4.2_08
* Also have jdk1.5.0_08 in the workspace
* Create a new Java project, specifying a project specific JRE for the project
- jdk1.5.0._08
* Select the newly created project and check its "properties..."
* Select the "Java Compiler" page to see that the compliance has been set to
1.5
* Press OK

==> build is started
==> new file gets added: '.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs' with:

#Thu Aug 10 11:51:55 CEST 2006
eclipse.preferences.version=1
internal.default.compliance=default

The "internal.default.compliance=default" seems to be the bad guy.

Looking at properties should not change my workspace.
