1) Open type hierarchy on type A
2) Stack type hierarchy view behind another view
3) Work for a few hours
4) Do F4 on a different type B:

Observe: 
 - type hierarchy view comes to front
 - type hierarchy for A is recomputed
 - type hierarchy for B is computed

It is wasting time recomputing the type hierarchy for A when it is about to be 
thrown away anyway.  When the type hierarchy for A is large, this is a large 
waste of time.

Martin, can you please investigate. I noticed the same behaviour when 
restarting Eclipse. When you open the first type hierarchy th eold one gets 
restored first.
when the part is created, the view automatically opens the previous hierarchy, 
not knowing that we will change this immediatly.
The fix would delay the initialization and e.g. use a background job that would 
then be cancelled when the new input is set.
... or better yet: calculate the *type hierarchy* in a background job and cancel
calculation as soon as a new focus is set.
fixed in 20040413


old type hierarchy refreshed when new type hierarchy requested [type hierarchy]
