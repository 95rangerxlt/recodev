From Julian:
I think the "Classpath Variable Selection" dialog is an OTI one (see screen cap 
below).  If so, would it be possible for you to forward on to the owner of this 
dialog the suggestion that some additional code gets included to strip off any 
trailing space characters that might be included in the "Path Extension" field. 
I'm getting repeatedly caught by this problem (as I cut and paste strings from 
the readmes that come with the various WSAD example projects).

Added the path validation routines from core.
This does not allow spaces at the end of a path.

Sorry that this is more restrictive than before, but I am not sure if trim a 
path is a valid -no change- operation.
