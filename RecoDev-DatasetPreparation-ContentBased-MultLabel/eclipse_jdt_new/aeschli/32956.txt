The only QF proposed for the "emulated method access" warning is to change the 
access modifier from private to protected. However, in many cases changing it to 
"package visible" is preferable since it doesn't make the method visible outside of the 
package.

The only available quick fix IMO should be to change the visibility form 
private to default.
