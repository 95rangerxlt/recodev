- create new project with New Project wizard
- after specifying the name go to next page (don't use Finish button)
- select project and press "Add Folder"
Observe: a new modal dialog appears showing the same information as the original dialog.
You can repeat the selection you've already made and you have to press another "Create New 
Folder" button.
This feels clumsy (for the 95% case).

I suggest either to:
- rename the "Add Folder" button to "Add Source Folder" (because that's what it is).
- skip the second dialog if the select project doesn't contain any folders. In this case
  there is no need for letting the user select an existing project.

or
- rename the button "Add Folder" to "Add Source Folder"
- and create a new button "Create Source Folder"

IMO the problem is that most user don't enter the second page so they aren't 
aware of source folders. So we somehow should give them a hint on the first 
page that for "complex" project setup they should specify different source 
folders.

The dialog that allows adding a folder is provided by platform. Another idea 
would be to create the new folder inplace in the dialog to avoid another 
stacked dialog.
From the frustration session:

give user a hint on first page that Next will allow setting up more complex 
projects: 
- simple project 
- simple with bin and src
- complex project (Finish disabled, Next enabled) 

Remove intermediate dialog when pressing Add Folder 

another idea is that when the project is empty and only the project itself is 
on the classpath as source folder, the 'add foilder' button gies directly to 
the 'create folder' input dialog
Postponing to M7.
Several improvements have been released:
The first page is improved and lets you select from 3 scenarios and is more
verbose about when the classpath is calculated from existing source.

On the second page, the 'add folder' button goes in checkbox tree instead of a
normal tree.
If only the project exists (and no folder is to choose from), the 'new folder'
dialog appears right away.
Same for class folders.

Adding first source folder to project looks too complex [code manipulation] [general issue]
