Visual request number is 3955.


Please verify that the delivered icons are transparent.
What do you mean by : 'icons are transparent' ?

BTW, the request is still pending. I got some icons but they were not good and in the wrong format. Now I'm trying to reopen the request..
>BTW, the request is still pending. 
I know. This was just a heads up.
