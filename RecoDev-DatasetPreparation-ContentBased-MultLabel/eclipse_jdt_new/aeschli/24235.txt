There needs to be a way for a plug-in developer to extend the behavior of the 
QuickFix mechanism that is available in the Java editor (via double clicking on 
a marker icon or several other inputs). In particular, there needs to be a way 
of providing a list of corrections available given a marker type.

A mechanism already exists for extending the QuickFix mechanism available in 
the Task view (by using the org.eclipse.ui.markerResolution extension point), 
but this does not effect the behavior of the editor's QuickFix mechanism. 
Ideally the two mechanisms would be reconciled so that developers only needed 
to create one extension.

Currently, however, the list of corrections is hard coded in the method 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.correction.JavaCorrectionProcessor.collectCorre
ctions(ProblemPosition,ArrayList).

For additional background, see the following messages in the jdt-ui-dev mailing 
list concerning this issue:

Contributed MarkerResolutions now also show up in the editor's quick fix list 
if quick fix has been invoked on the range of the marker (if the marker is a 
subtype of text marker)
MarkerResolution.run must be aware that the document might be open in the 
editor and must adapt the marker positions to it's current positions in the 
editor.

See MarkerResolutionGenerator in org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests how to do this.
Added test: MarkerResolutionTest creates a marker and invokes quick fix.

Open issue is the lightbulp. There is currently no lightpulp shown for quick 
fixes contributed by MarkerResolutions.
