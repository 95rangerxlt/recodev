An error dialog is displayed while deleting resources, and a few exceptions are
printed to the log.  I haven't tested how reproducible this problem is.  The
machine is Eclipse-GTK-I20030925, GNOME, RedHat 9.


STEPS:
1.) Make a workspace containing CVS projects for the platform-ui module, and
binary projects with linked content for the remaining Eclipse projects.  (this
project is from a previous I-build)
2.) Select all the binary projects, from the top to the bottom.
3.) Press the "Delete" key.

OBSERVED RESULTS:
Deletion starts to occur, but stops at some point with an error dialog.  Closing
the dialog and pressing delete again completes the deletion.

log file containing exceptions
problem occurs in organize imports
The problem is that after deleting we get a selection changed on an element 
which doesn't exist anymore.

Martin, this happens in organize import. As usual selection change listeners 
should handle the "not exist" exception more gracefully.
