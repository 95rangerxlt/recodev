We have to disable renaming of linked resources. Refactoring/Reorg doesn't 
support it either. JDT/Core is not able to fix it for 2.1.

Refactoring/Reorg also disabled moving of linked resources. Martin, are there 
any cases where quick fix moves CUs.

The other case where Quick Fix moves a CU is when the package declaration is
wrong and Quick Fix offers to move to the correct package.
I can't see right now how this could be a problem. Dirk, any idea?
