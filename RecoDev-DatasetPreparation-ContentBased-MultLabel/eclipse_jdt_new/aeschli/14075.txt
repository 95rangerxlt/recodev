Steps to reproduce:
 1. Create a new Java Project
 2. Set project directory to a directory of 
existing source
 3. Click 'Browse' to set output path, no folders are listed
 4. Set source 
path, click 'Add Existing Folders...', no folders are listed

Once the project has been 
created, existing folders are shown in the Java Build Path properties page.

This is with the 
M5 build.

Issue is that the project isn't yet created since the user hasn't pressed 
finish.

We should provide more support for this scenario. Since we cannot only make the 
existing source folders available we can also compute the build class path.


I would like to add to this..
If you have a directory structure lik:
MyProject
   +- src
      +- com
         
+- A.java

Setup a new project to use MyProject as the 'root' of the java project.
Select 'use 
source folders contained in project'.
It would be nice to have the src directory be suggested as 
a first good guess. (Just like when you create a new directory 'src' automatically suggests the 
ouput folder 'bin' to be created ).
Furthermore, Pressing 'Add exisiting folders' should show 
the existing folders on disk (i.e. 'src'), and not an empty directory!!
implemented in 20020514:
When creating a Java project and selecting an existing external project 
location, you will be prompted before entring the Java build path page if the 
project should be created early. If yes, source folders can be detected. Also 
the 'Add existing folder' dialog makes sense then.


Java Project wizard doesn't display existing project sub-folders
