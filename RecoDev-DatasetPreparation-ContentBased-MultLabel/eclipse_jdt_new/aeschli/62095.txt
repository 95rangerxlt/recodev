Build 20040513

When patching with latest JDTCore, with adjusted constant value for 
EmptyStatement optional warning, I saw the following entry in console.

1. it shouldn't be shown by default I suspect, only when in trace mode.
2. when option isn't readable it shouldn't be promoted to ERROR as observed
    when then looking at pref page. It should rather be turned back to IGNORE.

!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.ui 4 10001 May 13, 2004 15:37:08.30

now IGNORE is set when an option is not found.
I would like to keep the log message in a bit, otherwise I'll have no
information if users have problems with versions
