file:Outer.java

public class Outer{
   public static class Inner{
   }
}
----
file:Client.java

import Outer.Inner;
public class Client{
   {
      Object innerInstance = new Inner();
   }
}

In build rc1 (I20030221-win32), 'Organize Imports' command flips between adding
and removing the statement 'import Outer.Inner;'  With the import statement
removed, there is no 'Inner' class in scope, and therefore (correctly) causes a
compiler error.

This has been an issue in the past (I don't recall which version), but was
working correctly in the I20030211-win32 build (among others), simply adding the
import statement and leaving it be on subsequent organize import invocations.

Thanks in advance

Martin, can you please comment on this.
seems to be a bug in organize import. Suggest to fix this for RC2
Sorry can't reproduce a 'flipping'.

Both classes are in the default package.
I do an 'Organize import' on 'Client.java'; the import is kept, as required.
Can you give me more details?
sorry... I lied in the example (over simplified)... the following should
demonstrate the problem

**File: Outer.java**
package com;
public class Outer{
  public static class Inner extends Outer{
  }
}

**File: Client.java**
package org;

import cwillu.client.Outer.Inner;  //  <-- this line will flip in and out

public class Client{
  public class Save extends Inner{
  }
}
fixed > 20030302
