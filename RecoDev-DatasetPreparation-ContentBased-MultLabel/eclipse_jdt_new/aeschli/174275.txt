The Open Project action in the Package Explorer behaves a bit weird. If only closed projects are selected, the action appears in the context menu and works fine.

But if a mix of open and closed projects is selected, the action does not appear in the context menu, and 'menubar > Project > Open Project' shows a selection dialog.

=> When the selection contains at least one closed project,
- the action should be in the context menu (Navigator does that too, and it's in line with Close Project)
- the action should not show a dialog but open the closed project(s)
