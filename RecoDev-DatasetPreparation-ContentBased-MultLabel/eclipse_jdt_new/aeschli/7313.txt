Build 20011219

When I open the hierarchy on a class or interface which has many subtypes, it 
takes a long time to open, and expands the whole hierarchy.
The hierarchy expansion is pretty flashy, and causes visual clutter.

I would prefer it to only expand one level of subtypes.
If this could speed up the time to open, that would be even better.

When opening a type in the type hierarchy it supertypes and its children should 
be expanded only. This will result in some speed-up since less items are 
created, but internally the full type hierarchy is computed at once.

The flash is due to selecting and revealing a class once the hierarchy is 
opened. We should investigate whether bracketing the refresh setRedraw
(true/false) would help.
A good test case is to open the hierarchy on Object, relax and watch the type 
hierarchy work and scroll for almost a minute...
implemented the following strategy > 20109
supertypes-view: expand all
suptypes-view: expandToLevel(2) in normal mode, level(3) in filter mode
hierarchy-view:
  when focus on type: height of hierarchy from Object to focus type + 2
                      in filter mode: heigth + 3
  when focus on package / root or project: 2
                      in filter mode: 3
