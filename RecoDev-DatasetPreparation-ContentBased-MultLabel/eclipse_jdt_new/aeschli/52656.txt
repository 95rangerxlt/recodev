I just realized: the type hierarchy also shows no subtypes when in "Show Type
Hierarchy" mode. However when it is in "Show Subtype Hierarchy" mode, subtypes
are shown. 

If this behavior of the quick hierarchy is intended, at least the affordance
"Press Ctrl+T to see subtype hierarchy" should be changed.
Yep, I found this today as well
