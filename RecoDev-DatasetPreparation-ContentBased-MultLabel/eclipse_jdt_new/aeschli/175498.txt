        public static enum TestEnum {
                V1,
                V2
        }

        public void test(final TestEnum value) {
                switch (value) {
                        case V1:
                        case V2:
                }
        }
}

The following imports are added by 'Organize imports':

import static sample.Test.TestEnum.V1;
import static sample.Test.TestEnum.V2;

These imports are useless, they are correctly reported as unused, but they get added anyway. Moreover, they are static imports and I was told that no static imports should be added by 'Organize imports' (#165069).

I have observed that this issue is triggered by the combination of:
- the case clauses of switch statement,
- the fact that the TestEnum enum is embedded,
- the fact that the Test class is generic.
