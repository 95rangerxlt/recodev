 foo.getThenCondition()

using quick assist to 'assign statement to new local variable' 
should suggest the name 'thenCondition' as the local name (like 'extract temp' does)

now it suggests 'expression', which is much less appropriate in most cases

The suggestions come from JDT-Core's name suggestion infrastructure. These 
suggestions are ordered by jdt.core. They seem to prefer shorter over longer 
names.

File a new bug against JDT-core
'extract temp' should be changed to use the jdt core name guessing 
infrastructure.
it is not shorter vs. longer names - it's about guessing that if a method is
called 'getFooBar' then the temp should maybe be called 'fooBar'.

afair, extract temp uses the jcore suggestions if the heuristic cannot be used
(e.g. the name does not start with 'get')
