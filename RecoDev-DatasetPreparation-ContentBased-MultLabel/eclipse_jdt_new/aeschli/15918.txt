I created a new package in the Java Browsing Perspective
and the packages showed up twice 'til 
the Package View
got refreshed.
The label decorations are not refreshed properly 
sometimes.
When I fix all the problems and save the Types View
still shows that there is a 
problem and sometimes
the CVS decorations are not working properly, but I couldn't
figure 
out a pattern for it.

Environment:
OS: Windows 2000
JDK: 1.4
Build: 20020510
