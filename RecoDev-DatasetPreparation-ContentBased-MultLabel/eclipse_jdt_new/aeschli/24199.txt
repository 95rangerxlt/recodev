Why should a full rebuild of the workspace be required when you add a classpath variable?  Because 
it's a new variable it doesn't affect any existing projects.  It would be more convenient if a 
rebuild were not required when adding a new classpath variable.

Thanks.

JDT/UI is triggering the rebuild, it is true though that if no-one is 
referencing the variable, it should not do so.

Also, you can discard the full build (the dialog is only a suggestion) if you 
know you don't need it.

Moving to JDT/UI.
The popup message says, "A full rebuild is required to make changes effective." so I assumed I had 
to rebuild the workspace even when adding classpath variables.
is it always required, Martin?
No, not always.
Question to JCore: Is it possible to have a method that evaluates if a rebuild 
is really needed? (Is it enough to look in all classpaths to find out if a 
modified / deleted / new variable is referenced)?

Move this PR back to me if the code would be simple and you prefer it to be in 
the preference page.
If the added/deleted/modified variable is never referenced by any of the Java 
project, it is safe to bypass the request to full build.

Also you may want to funace the dialog message and make it more clear that it 
is only a conservative suggestion.
added code to check if variable is used in a classpath + changed the message
'build is recommended..'
