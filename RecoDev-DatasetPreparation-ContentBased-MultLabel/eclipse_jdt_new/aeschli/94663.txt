The description of what 'combine rules' does is not correct. Should add a
description that is more specific for project entries so that this is
understandable.

Current text says:

"When accessing a type in the entry, the rules are processed top down until a
rule pattern matches.  When no pattern matches, the rules defined for
corresponding child entry are taken."

As someone who has never defined access rules, this leaves me with a few questions:

1) What is an entry?  Is it different from a rule?
2) What is a child entry?
3) The child entry corresponding to what?

Also, to nitpick, there needs to be either "the" or "a" between "for" and
"corresponding".


Improve description on access rule page
