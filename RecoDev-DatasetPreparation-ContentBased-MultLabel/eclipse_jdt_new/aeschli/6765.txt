Build 20011206, Win2000

Steps:

1) Put the type hierarchy view in "Hierarchy View Only"
2) Shutdown the workbench and restart
3) The type hierarchy is now missing its toolbar buttons, the ones that cycle 
between the different type hierarchy modes.

Workaround is to switch to "Vertical Viewer Orientation", then back
to "Hierarchy View Only", then the buttons reappear.

Side note: This seems to be the only place in the UI that the term "Viewer" is 
used.  Maybe it should say "Vertical View Orientation", etc.  There's probably a 
JFace viewer underneath, but users are only aware of views, not viewers.
