Martin, unclear if it is the text editor or code manipulation. Can you please 
comment.
is jdt.text. I didn't touch the behaviour: the autoindenter adds an own list of 
proposals. would now be possible that the code template is used. I have a look 
if we want to fix that for 2.1
IMO we should fix this for 2.1 since it looks strange.
