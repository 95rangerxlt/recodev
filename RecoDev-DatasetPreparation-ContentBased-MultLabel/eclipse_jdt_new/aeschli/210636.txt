When trying to activate 'import' completion (ctrl-space), while typing some new code, the FDQN is added into the code instead of creating the associated import more often than not. Strange enough, if I save the edited text just before using the completion, the normal completion is applied (ie, import updated).

Tis is a little bit painful, it was working so fine in 3.2 :)

I also see this, but quite rarely. So you have a code example where it is reproducible?

Well, I can't reproduce it easily, it happens from time to time. I'm working on quite a big code base (apache directory server), and every now and then, I have this problem.

Sometime, you simply save the file, and it's over, you don't have the problem anymore. May be it's related to the current order of existing imports, which are reorganized ? I have no clue...

But as you also see this this is not just me :) It never happened in 3.2.
Sorry, but without a test case we can't do much.
I know, but as I said, this is something which happens randomly, and I'm not alone to have seen this happening.

I _don't_ have random test case... I just see it happens and it wasn't the case with 3.2. Obviously, something has been changed between those two versions.

Nevertheless, this _is_ a real problem...

I was able to reproduce it in the debugger... Problem is in the import rewriter context.
