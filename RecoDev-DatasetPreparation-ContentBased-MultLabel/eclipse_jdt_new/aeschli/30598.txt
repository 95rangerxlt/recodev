When overriding a method, the @see comment that is constructed is wrong, e.g. 
having a class TestClass, when overriding java.lang.Object.clone, the comment 
says:

@see TestClass#clone()

instead of

@see java.lang.Object#clone()

Addition: this happens when overriding a method via code assist. This does not 
happen when methods are created via Source->Override or the class wizard.
