We should not use "extrude" to describe this quick assist.  "extrude" means 
forcing (often through some device) to produce something.  We should find a 
brief phrase to describe the operation and use it instead.

I assume we are avoiding extract since it is used in the various refactorings.  
This assist causes the program to behave differently - it should be clear from 
the description that the transformation has this characteristic.

John, do you have a better suggestion. We weren't happy with the name from the 
beginning but couldn't come up with a better one.
how 'bout something like 'remove surrounding block' ?
or 'remove surrounding xxx' where xxx is one of the 3 or 4 possibilities 
('for statement', etc.)

it does not have to be very brief as it does not appear in menus
remove surrounding "do" sounds ok.
I was trying to find a way to call it "unwrap"
fixed > 20030210

Change to 'Remove surrounding 'do' statement', 'Remove surrounding 'if' 
statement' ect...
