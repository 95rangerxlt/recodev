public class DD {
	private int DD()[]{
	};
}

quick fix - change to constructor

you get
public class DD {
	privateDD()[]{
	};
}
which has syntax errors

Problem still exists under build I20021113 using latest Core patch
The AST returns a length of '4' for the 'int'.

added test case
ASTRewritingMethodDeclTest.testMethodDeclaration_bug24916
Fixed and released in 2.1 stream.
Now the length is 3 as expected.
Your test ASTRewritingMethodDeclTest.testMethodDeclaration_bug24916 is boggus.
You need to remove the extra dimension after converting your method to a
constructor.


fixed for 20021210
