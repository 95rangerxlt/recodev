Following the steps described by Markus in bug 85298 comment 2, the anonymous is
not removed.
Debugging the code it appears that the anonymous is located using its name. This
cannot work. The name of an anonymous is empty. The source range should be used
instead.
isLocal() is no longer the problem.

Tobias, can you please investigate.
The AST node lookup has been fixed to return the AnonymousClassDeclaration node for EnumConstantDeclarations.
However the result after the rewriting is wrong. It seems that the ASTRewrite cannot handle deletions of anonymous class declarations for enum constants.
