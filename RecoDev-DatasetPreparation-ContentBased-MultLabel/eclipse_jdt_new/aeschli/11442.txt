The button labels of the CheckedTreeSelectionDialog aren't localized.  (See 
createSelectionButtons()).  The class SelectionDialog (which is one of its 
superclasses) already provides localized labels I think.  So you might want to 
replace the hard coded names with SelectionDialog.SELECT_ALL_TITLE and 
SelectionDialog.DESELECT_ALL_TITLE (or add your own translation).  

Even better, because "select all" and "select none" are used quite often, tell 
the Platform/JFace team to add these to the IDialogConstants interface class.
