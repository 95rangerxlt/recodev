Suppose two files:

a/A.java :

package a;
interface A
{
	interface AA {}
}

b/B.java:

package b;
import a.A;
class F implements A.AA
{}

Do import organization in b/B.java, it changes to:

package b;
import a.A.AA; // changed here
class F implements A.AA // resovling error
{}

An error issued as follow:
A cannot be resolved to a type.

Martin, can you please comment.
I'm not exactly reproducing your error, but 'A' doesn't get imported because it
is not visible from 'F'. 
Things work for me as soon as I make 'A' and 'AA' public.

Please reopen if you can not confirm this.
sorry, missing a type parameter.

a/A.java :

package a;
public interface A
{
	public static interface AA<T> {}
}

b/B.java:

package b;
import a.A;
public class B implements A.AA<Object>
{
}
works in latest (m5)


Import organizing causes resolving errors [code manipulation]
