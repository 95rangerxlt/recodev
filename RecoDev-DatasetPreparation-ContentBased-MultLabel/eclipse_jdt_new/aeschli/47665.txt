I launch type hierarchies in their own perspective in their own window, like 
the old Smalltalk days. ;)

But when I select F4 to open a hierarchy on a method, the method is not 
selected in the outliner of the new hierarchy perspective, nor is there a 'link 
with editor' option.

The method gets selected if the type hierarchy opens in the same Window. 
Martin, can you please have a look. For the link issue there is already bug 
42990 
fixed > 20031220

After opening, the opened method is now selected. 
Bug 42990 dicusses the 'Link with editor' inconsistency.
