We just released in JDT/Core an option for signalling missing serialVersionUID 
for serializable classes (see bug 69942).

This should be reflected in UI.
* COMPILER / Reporting Missing Declaration of serialVersionUID Field on 
Serializable Class
*    When enabled, the compiler will issue an error or a warning whenever a 
serializable class is missing a local declaration 
*    of a serialVersionUID field. This field must be declared as static final 
and be of type long.
*     - option 
id:         "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.missingSerialVersion"
*     - possible values:   { "error", "warning", "ignore" }
*     - default:           "warning"

For quickfix purpose, we added IProblem.MissingSerialVersion.

For quickfix purpose, we added IProblem.MissingSerialVersion.
I suggest option label: 'Serializable class without serialVersionUID' 
under 'Style' tab.
I have added the Compiler preference to the preference and properties page. 
However no quick fix got implemented yet. 
Added QuickFixes to generate default SUID and compiler-generated SUID.
Fix contributed by Tobias Widmer.
