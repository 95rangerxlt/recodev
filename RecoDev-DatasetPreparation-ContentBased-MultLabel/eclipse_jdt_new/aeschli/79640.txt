Under 3.0, Test case classes could be nested static classes. This no longer
seems to work in 3.1.

i.e. the following used to work under 3.0, and no longer works in 3.1:

public class ClassToTest {
...
   public static class Test extends junit.framework.TestCase{
     ...
   }
}

The error message that is displayed is:

Launching...
"Test type does not exist" 

According to the ErrorLog page, this is generated by org.eclipse.jdt.junit

Erich, 

Erol did change something here. Can you remember what he did ?
Pinging Erich...
Martin - this seem related to erol's test searcher changes

Must have been there before Erol's patch. The bug is to use
type.getFullyQualifiedName(). Should always use type.getFullyQualifiedName('.')

A simple testcase.
This still seems to be broken in 3.1.1 and 3.2M4.
It also doesn't work in Eclipse 3.0.2.  Environment is JUnit 3.8.
Sorry, this looks like a slightly different problem.  If you select 'Run As' from the context menu, Eclipse no longer recognizes that a class having a nested TestCase is runnable as a JUnit test and no longer offers that choice on the context menu.  No error messages are generated.
Fran, can you open a bug report?
