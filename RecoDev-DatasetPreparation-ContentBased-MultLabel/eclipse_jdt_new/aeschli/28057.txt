Build 20021210

On Java Build Path property (Source tab), the "Add Existing Folders" button 
brings up a Source Folder Selection dialog which has a "Create New Folder" 
button on it. This makes the "Create New Folder" button is superfluous. It 
would be simpler for users if there was a single button named "Add Folder".
