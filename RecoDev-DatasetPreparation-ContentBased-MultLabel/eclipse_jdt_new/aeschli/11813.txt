The variable path looses cases-sensitivity information. Therefore, path
comparisons for identical paths return false.

This is a problem for "Open External Javadoc" on rt.jar which is defined by
JRE_LIB. It could also be a problem for code which tried to detetect if the JRE
has changed.

IMPORTANT: I just found out that this is only a problem with the DETECTED JDK.

Not fully true: It happens also when editing/entering the path directly in the
fields instead of using the directory browser.
