If you format every CU in a given package/project/folder, the files on disk are 
changed. Unless you happen to have the file open, even if the editor is clean 
or in some other workbenchwindow, the change is not saved to disk.  This seems 
like arbitrary and unpredictable consequences of having a file open in an 
editor. If I invoke other actions using the same view (Package Explorer) such 
as "replace with HEAD", the file is changed on disk, not in memory, and the 
editor is not dirtied, but is refreshed to reflect the persisted state.

The batch operations should work as follows:

- if saveed then it is saved after the operation
- if dirty it stays dirty

In the second case, I think the user should be informed.  The user may not know 
about the dirty working copies if:
a) the java editors are in a different WorkbenchWindow
b) some other editor has indirectly opened the .java file (such as UML editor)
