build I20030211

- open a CU (e.g. BookmarkNavigator.java)
- position the cursor between methods
- F4
- it opens the type hierarchy on the class, but also changes the text editor's 
selection to select the class name

It should not affect the text editor selection.

still a problem in I20030716

not really major compared to other bugs.
There are 2 issues here
1) the TypeHierarchyViewPart reveals the element on selection change (which
happens initially)
2) the OpenTypeHierarchyUtil reveals as well.
