I suggest an extra option in the import organizer - "Import static .* for 
enums".

Currently, the import organizer imports either individual classes and enum 
fields, or .* when their count exceeds a preset value per package ("Number of 
imports needed for .*"). While this should do for class imports, enums are most 
likely to be imported wholly. With the usual setting of >30 import count 
needed, the imports section gets horribly cluttered with all individually 
statically imported fields of enums used.

You can now configure separate star-import thresholds for static and for normal imports (> 20060119)
