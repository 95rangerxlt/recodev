When creating a project that does NOT use source folders (and does not use a 
bin directory for .class files) the .java and .class files are stored together 
in the Java package structure.

When converting a project to use source folders (and the required bin directory 
for .class files), the old .class files stored in the Java package structure 
are NEVER DELETED by Eclipse.  This is a bug for Eclipse 1.0 and 2.0.

Since I use WSDD 4.0 (which is built on Eclipse 1.0), I've seen compilation 
errors due to the fact that the compiler/JDT is using old .class files rather 
than the new ones in the project's bin directory.

I have not managed to reproduce the compile errors in build 20020416.  But 
since the old .class files should have been deleted this is still a bug for the 
latest build.

This needs to be driven by the UI so as to interact with user.
