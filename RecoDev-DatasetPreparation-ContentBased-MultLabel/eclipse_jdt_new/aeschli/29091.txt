Using org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.MainTypeSelectionDialog, 
override TwoPaneElementSelector#createDialogArea(Composite)

createDialogArea is created but is has protected visibility.
I believe it should have public visibility as 
TwoPaneElementSelector#createDialogArea(Composite) is public and one cannot 
reduce the visibility of the inherited method.

Correct. I think the reason is that Dialog declares the method as protected.
