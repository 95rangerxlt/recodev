A new compiler option was added to diagnose when 'enum' is used as an 
identifier (bug 66533). This new option will be in the integration build but 
is not inside the JDTCore monday early preview.

The 'Java>Compiler>Compliance and Classfiles' preference page needs to be 
updated to show this option.

A new ComboBox could be added or the ComboBox of 'Dissallow identifiers called 
assert' could be used for the both options.
