quick fix and quick assist don't want to be enabled together on the same text 
selection

create this method
void foo(int bar){
}

now, the param 'bar' is unused so i see a warning wiggly
i'm not concerned about it now and would like to use quick assist to rename the 
param

that, however, is not possible - pressing ctrl+1 shows me only the option of 
removing the paramter

in general, quick fix and quick assist should be able to cohabit in the same 
ctrl+1 popup

Now you see quick assists also when you are on a pronlem position.
The cursor does not move to the next problem position if the selection has a
length > 0


quick fix obscures quick assist [quick assist] [quick fix]
