Build 20020501

1) Create a class "TestingFoo" in package "Testing".
2) In another package, create a class and method and type "TestingFoo".
3) With the cursor at the end of "TestingFoo", hit Ctrl+Shift+M to add the 
import.

It deletes part of the class name, and all that's left is "oo".  

I guess it does a match against the package name, and since the package name is 
a prefix of the class name, it incorrectly deletes part of the class name.
