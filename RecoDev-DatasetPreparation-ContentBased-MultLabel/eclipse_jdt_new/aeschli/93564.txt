The story for adding the @Override annotation is currently abit confusing. Only
the override dialog offers to add the annotation, all other override actions
(quick fix, code assist) don't add it.

A code style preference setting should be added to be used by all of them and
the override wizatd checkbox removed.

Requesting PMC approval for new the preference constant

/**
 * A named preference that controls whether to add a override annotation for
newly created methods
 * <p>
 * Value is of type <code>Boolean</code>.
 * </p>
 * @since 3.1
