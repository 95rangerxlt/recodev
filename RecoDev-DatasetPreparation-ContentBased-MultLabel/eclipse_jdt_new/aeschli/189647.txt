This is on 3.3RC2.

1. Create a new Java project
2. Access its project properties, go to the Java Compiler preference page.
3. Check 'Enable project settings' to enable the SWT Group below.
4. 'Use default compliance settings' is unchecked but everything below is disabled.
5. Check 'Use default compliance settings', everything is disabled.
6. Uncheck it, now everything is enabled.

Essentially, the checkbox should start off as being checked instead of being unchecked since everything below starts off as being disabled. Alternatively, it could be unchecked as is and everything is enabled.

My workspace level preferences are to use the defaults. When you access the project's preferences page, you'll notice that while the 'Enable project specific settings' checkbox is unchecked and everything below is disabled, the 'Use default compliance setting' checkbox is checked.

I hope this makes sense.
