I have a marker and its position is pointing to a javadoc position(i think all 
kind of comment will have the same problem). e.g if the javadoc position is 38, 
my marker will be Marker.CHAR_START = 38, IMarker.CHAR_END = 38. After done, a 
lightbulb will be showed in the left side of the editor. I
click on that, not quickfix dialog come up but make some beep noise.

I think the lightblub should work in any position either it is comment position 
or not.

currently i am using RC1.
I fixed this already for RC2. The Quick fix correction processor was not added
for Javadoc or normal comments partitions. As we don't have fixes for comments
we never saw this, but of course contributers can add own quick fixes that also
correct in comments.
Martin pls confirm that the fix is in and dispose the bug
fix in RC2


if the lightblub position is inside a comment, quickfix won't work.
