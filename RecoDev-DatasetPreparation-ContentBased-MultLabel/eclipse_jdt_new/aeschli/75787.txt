The SelectionListenerWithASTManager uses "Java AST creation" as its name. This
is very misleading in the Progress view but even worse when there's an error in
one of the listeners (e.g. add an NPE to one of it): a dialog comes up telling
there's an error with AST creation.

See: JavaUIMessages.properties:
SelectionListenerWithASTManager.job.title=Java AST creation

I think it's a good name. It mostly creates an AST.
What would be a better suggestion?
Give me one case where it creates the AST?
ok, you're right. 'Getting AST', 'Waiting for AST' ?
or "Sending selection with AST"
A bit too technical
Agree but it should at least contain as much info so that we know where it comes
from. If I'd ask you where "get ast" error comes from you wouldn't point at
SelectionListenerWithASTManager.

changed to 'Requesting Java AST from selection'
