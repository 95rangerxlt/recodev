I20050315-1100 + zrh-plugins for I20050322

Highlighting of the drop target is broken in Package Explorer, Type Hierarchy,
Outline, ...:

The drop target tree item under the cursor is only rendered as selected when the
mouse cursor points to the top or bottom quarter of the item label. When the
cursor is moved towards the center of the tree item, the item is not rendered as
selected (but it should).

The drop action seems to work regardless of the missing visual feedback.
