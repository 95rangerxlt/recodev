With OrganizeImportsAction, it is easy to complete the not-so-easy task of 
organizing compilation unit imports. However this demands that an 
IWorkbenchSite be known to the action. When performing refactoring (e.g. an 
inner class removal) by own means, it is strongly desirable to be able to 
employ the native Eclipse capabilities of the imports section organization but 
in this case any UI response of the imports organization action is imperatively 
prohibited. 
    It would be great if one could employ the OrganizeImportsAction 
capabilities without supplying it with an IWorkbenchSite instance. Instead, it 
could respond with some status value signifying the action result, or even just 
bail out on the first error encountered. Thanks.

Unfortunatly no new API for 3.1.
