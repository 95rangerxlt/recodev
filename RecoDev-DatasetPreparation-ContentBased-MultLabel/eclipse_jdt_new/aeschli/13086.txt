These are issues with the new configurability enabled project creation wizard. 
Moving to platform UI
Not sure if this is still an issue since we backed out of capabilities as the 
main project creation story.
However, we should ensure that we look consistent and don't violate expected 
wizard behaviour.
See issue #2 below for reason to hand it back to JDT. Beside that, there is 
nothing for the Eclipse UI team to do at the moment, so it can be closed when 
JDT addresses issue #2.


issue #1 - capability page not properly alligned
==> could not reproduce this with latest build (M5 integration and activating 
the proper code)

issue #2 - "Add Java" step says "Create a Java project"
==> that is a JDT problem, they should update the description to be more 
useful. A capability does not create a project, it adds some 
behavior/functionality to the project...back to you guys on this one ;-)

issue #3 - cannot go back
==> since this wizard is gone for release 2.0, it is no longer an issue (by the 
way, did it surprise you and that is why you reported it or just notice it was 
inconsistent?

issues #4 - cancel does not work
==> again, since this wizard is gone for release 2.0, it is no longer an issue 
(the plan was to remove the created project...maybe even prompt to see if 
that's what the user wanted).
#1: what I mean is that the Java page widgets are inside a group an therefore
the left and right margin is not alligned from top to bottom but have a little
margin.

#3: I noticed it because I made an error and wanted to go back AND: all our
"new" wizards allow to go back.

Will capabilities not be part of 2.0 or do you fully redesign/change the new
(now disabled) "New" wizard?

fixed #2, renamed to 'Configure Java build paths'
