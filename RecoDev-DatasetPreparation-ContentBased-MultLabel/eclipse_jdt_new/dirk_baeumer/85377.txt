The new Help view shows a generic help message when the Call Hierarchy is
active. What's strange, is that the message is different from the generic
message you get when the ASTView or the Progress View is active.

I filed bug 85681 for call hierarchy help text. Currently,
IJavaHelpContextIds.java defines various help context IDs for the call
hierarchy, but none of them are implemented in
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/contexts_JDT.xml .

I guess we should remove the superfluous IDs and just leave a single one for the
whole view, which can then be described in one sentence.
Fixed.
