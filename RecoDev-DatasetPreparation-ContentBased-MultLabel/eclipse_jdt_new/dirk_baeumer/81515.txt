Package Explorer with empty selection has "Open Projects" and "Close Projects"
context menu items in Working Sets mode as well as in Projects mode.

AFAICS, the actions should allow to open/close all projects in a working set. If
so, they should be called "Open/Close Projects in Working Set" and they should
also appear if some of the projects in the working set are already closed/open.

+1... this is really confusing, because the label does not describe the
function, and because they show up even when they don't perform any action.
The actions are now available when a mixed set of open/closed projects exist. Action don't appear anymore when selection isn't a working set. So the naming is OK for me since the user selected a working set and the actions are called "Open/Close Projects".

Marking as fixed for 3.2 since the problem got fixed a while ago.


Open/Close Projects menus in Package Explorer have strange selection dependency
