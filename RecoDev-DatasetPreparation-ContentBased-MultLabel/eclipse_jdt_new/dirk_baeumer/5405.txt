1. no magic ... in the menu entry
2. 'getting method name' should be just 'getter name' (that's what we use 
elsewhere in the ui)
3. same for setter
4. if the field is already private - 
it should not try to change its visiblity again
5. should give an option to encapsulate even accesses in the same class
