Extracting to method the code in between /*START*/ and /*END*/ results in invalid source:

package p1;

import java.io.*;
public class X {
	void foo(final int out){
		int i;
		if (out > 5){
			/*START*/i = 1;/*END*/
		} else {
			i = 2;
		}
		i++;
	}
}

=====>

package p1;

import java.io.*;
public class X {
	void foo(final int out){
		int i;
		if (out > 5){
			i = asd(i);	// COMPLAINS THAT VARIABLE 'i' MAY NOT HAVE BEEN INITIALIZED - diagnosis is correct
		} else {
			i = 2;
		}
		i++;
	}
	protected int asd(int i) {
		i = 1;
		System.out.println(i);
		return i;
	}
}

NOTES:

DB (06.06.2001 14:23:42)
	The only way to fix this is to generate the extracted method as follows:

	protected int asd() {
		return 1;
	}

	Impact of this fix on extract method is high, since we have to do some analysis for the extracted method.

	Opt to not fix this for June.

PRODUCT VERSION:
SDK 119


works for me in the latest
20020115: Now, by extracting "i = 1;" I get

package p1;

import java.io.*;
public class X {
	void foo(final int out){
		int i;
		if (out > 5){
			asd();
		} else {
			i = 2;
		}
		i++;
	}
	protected void asd() {
		int i;
		i = 1;
	}
}

asd() doesn't do anything useful and it changes the behaviour of foo.
See previous comment

Refactoring - variable extraction can lead to incorrect code (1GEWDNW)
