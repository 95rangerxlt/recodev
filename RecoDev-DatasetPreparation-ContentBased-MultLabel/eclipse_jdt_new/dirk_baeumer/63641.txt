Here is what I did:

- kept the Open since it was to confusing with the Show in
- renamed Show Outline/Type Hierarchy to Quick ...
- removed Cut from the context menu if disabled. The goupd doesn't know
  anything about the package explorer and I don't want to introduce the
  dependency (class is API) so I removed it if the action is disabled.
- didn't reorder introduce parameter since it is more comparable to 
  extract local, constant. You select an expression and convert it into
  another element.
Released...
start verifying.
Problem: Cut is not enabled for types. Verified the other changes.
Cut wasn't disabled in the past for type (checked in M9). So the fix is OK.
