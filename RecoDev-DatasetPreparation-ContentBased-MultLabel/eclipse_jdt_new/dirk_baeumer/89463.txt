The new search filters (inexact & erasure) should appear directly in the view
menu where applicable. Currently the user always has to open the filters dialog
to toggle them.

Inexact is always applicable. Erasure is applicable for references and
occurrences search for generic types and methods.

Currently I only enable them by default for reference search to parameterized
types. Should consider methods as well.
Fixed.
