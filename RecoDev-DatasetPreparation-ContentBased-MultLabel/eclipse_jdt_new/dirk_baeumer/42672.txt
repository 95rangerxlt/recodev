The class org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.reorg.JavaElementTransfer 
is an internal class for copying java elements to and from the clipboard.  This 
class should be public API so that other views and editors that manipulate 
instances of IJavaElement can reuse this commonly used behavior in a compatible 
way.  Without this as a public API, third party editors and views may not be 
compatible with existing JDT editors and views.

org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.reorg.JavaElementTransfer is in JDT/UI.
Move to JDT/UI.
Should investigate for 3.0
Fixed for M9. There is now a method JavaUI#getJavaElementClipboardTransfer


JavaElementTransfer should be public
