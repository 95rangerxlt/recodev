Build: 20020426 (M5++)

to reproduce the problem:

1. new class
2. keep editor open for the class
3. new default visibility field
4. make the class read-only
5. in the outliner select the field
6. from the pulldown select refactor->self-encapsulate
7. the operation attempts to run and then fails
8. click undo to undo the changes, your editor will be marked dirty, but you 
can't save because the file is read-only

8. click undo to undo the changes, your editor will be marked dirty, but you

The operation now issues a fatal error if the file is read-only.

Fixed in build > I20020502


Self-encapsulate failure + undo scribbles in read-only file
