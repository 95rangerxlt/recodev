See TextBufferTest.testMoveWithRangeMarker2

The RangeMarker is inside the MoveSource, and the MoveSource inside a delete:
The resulting range of the Range Marker is deleted, not moved
(TextBufferTest.testMoveWithRangeMarker shows that is works if there is no
surrounding delete)

My test case:
ASTRewritingTrackingTest.testNamesWithMove3
Got fixed for M2.


TextEdits: Moved positions removed
