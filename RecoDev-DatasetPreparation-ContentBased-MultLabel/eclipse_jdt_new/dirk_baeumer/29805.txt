Build I20030115

Here is the proposal we want to implement (it is pretty much what Randy Hudson 
proposed):

The user must explicitly disable the adding of the wildcard by using a special 
end symbol. But instead of using the '.' JDT proposes to use the % character. 
Here are the reasons:

- '.' is used in fully qualified name as a separator. The open type dialog
  already supports entering qualified names (e.g. junit.framework.* shows all
  types in the framework package). So it will be confusing if we use it as the
  end symbol as well.
- '$' is used by various Unix tools (grep, ...) to denote the end symbol, but
  it is as legal character inside a Java identifier. Some generated classes
  inside rt.jar contain a $ character. 
- so we have to use a character that is not a legal character for Java 
  identifiers. We tried several operators and we decide to go for the % 
  since it is easy to recognize and easy to type.

I have opened the bug to further track this issue. Please add comments to this 
bug instead of replying to this post since bugs are easier trackable.

Entered bug 29854 to make sure the Platform UI dialog behaves like the JDT 
dialog.
What about '!' or '<' which look more like ending something than '%'
I vote against SPACE which was proposed by Jared in the newsgroup.

*** Bug 30230 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I also prefer '<' over '%'. Released a version that uses '<' to denote the end 
of name character.

Fixed for build > 20030127
