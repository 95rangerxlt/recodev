When I have the string "Windows" selected in:

    public static final boolean IS_OS_WINDOWS = getOSMatches("Windows");

Right-click/Refactor does not let me extract "Windows" as a static.
Version 3.1.M1.

Moving to JDT UI for comments.
Global Refactor menu works, but not context menu.
Problem is the fact the the enablement logic doesn't consider initializers for 
fields. 
Fixed for M2.
