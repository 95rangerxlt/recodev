Current code is:

public void dispose() {
    for (Iterator iter= fRegistry.values().iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {
	Image image= (Image)iter.next();
	image.dispose();
    }
}

Statement fRegistry.clear() missing after dispose

Current implementation doesn't cause harm since calling dispose on a dispose 
image is ignored.

Must be fixed after M3

Darin, you should do the same with the copy in debug UI.



Fixed for JDT UI in build > 20020214
