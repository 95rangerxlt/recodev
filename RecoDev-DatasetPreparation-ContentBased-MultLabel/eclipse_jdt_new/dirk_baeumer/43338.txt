With the updcoming switch to primary working copies, FlushListener.UndoManager
should be revisited

- changes are now reported in primary working copy, but then not anymore in an
extra delta on save: The listener would miss these changes.
- The line 'details != IJavaElementDelta.F_CHILDREN' should be changed to
details & IJavaElementDelta.F_CHILDREN != 0
- Make sure to not react to flags like 'F_PRIMARY_WORKING_COPY'.

dirk, it would be good to have this for M4
Got implemented for M4. There is now a Save flush listener that listens to 
resource changes.


Revisit FlushListener.UndoManager [refactoring]
