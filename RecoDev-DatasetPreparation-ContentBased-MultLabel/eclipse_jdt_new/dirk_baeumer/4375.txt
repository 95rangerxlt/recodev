- load JUnit into the workspace
- add package junit.dummy
- add class A in junit.dummy
- move A to util.
- you end up having the following code

package junit.util;
import junit.dummy.*;

public class A {

}

waiting for 4271
fixed - trade off is of course performance.
only needed types are imported.
imports to types from the destination package are removed altogether.


Move CU - import computation should be smart
