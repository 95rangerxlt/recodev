In the context menu of the Java Editor, there are currently no refactor menu items. Having those 
refactorings that depend on the editor selection (like inline/rename local variable, rename 
argument, extract method) only in the main menu "Refactor" is not intuitive and disruptive to 
the work process. 
I would like to have them in the editor context menu as well.

(Based on 
Integration Build 20011127)

This depends on the overall menu consolidation planed for 2.0. Waiting for the 
final proposal.
I miss the menu items too. to be considered as part of the menu reorg.
Fixed for build > I20020508
