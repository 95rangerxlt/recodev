The first time I press Ctrl+Shift+T after doing some other stuff, I often have
to wait for a modal "Checking consistency of Type History..." progress dialog to
finish until I can start typing the typename I want to open. The progress dialog
is annoying and interrupts my workflow.

It would be much more convenient if this checking could be done in the
background and the type selection dialog with the text input field would show up
immediately.

The history could just start empty and be filled in one batch after consistency
has been ensured.

Putting this into the background will ask for another problem: the dialog can
come up empty although a history exists. I had this in a first implementation
and got lost of complains about this.

All I can do to avoid this is to listen to java model deltas and update the
cache instead of checking the consistency.

Markus, can you look in which use case pattern this happens.
Could there also be an option added to empty the history, or prevent user-
selected typed from ever being added to the history?

(If such options already exist, I can't find them, nor can any web 
searching.  :-)
To remove elements from the history select them in the dialog and press delete
or activate remove from the context menu
This got address in the 3.2 stream by putting the consistency check into the background.


Checking consistency of Type History... should be done after type selection dialog is up
