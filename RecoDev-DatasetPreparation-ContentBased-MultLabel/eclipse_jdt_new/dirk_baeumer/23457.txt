Opening for Jim Thorpe:

The context menu for a Project (right click on a Project) used to have the "f" 
designated as a hot key for Refresh. 
 
Now it goes to Refactor.  The "f" should be redesignated as Refresh since 
Refresh will be used much more frequently than Refactor and many people will be 
used to the previous designation.

It is very hard to come up with unique mnemonics. Are you aware that a second 
click on 'f' takes you to Refresh. 

Possibility would be to change it to 't'.
