1. in the jdt.ui code AddGetterSetterAction, I selected line 72, 
(EditorUtility.openInEditor(cu);)
2. Invoke 'Surround with try/catch'
 Error dialog shows up:
  ' The following error prevents performing the operation.
    No uncaught exception thrown by the selected statement(s) '

- is an information, but the description says 'error'
- openInEditor throws a CoreException.

More:

1. Select a comment line (e.g. line 142 in TestCase
2. A list comes up with two entries saying the same:
  'Selection must cover either whole try catch statement or parts....'

3. message is not appropriate (I selected a part inside the try block) and 
duplicated
First problem (uncaught exception): you now get a dialog asking if you want to 
catch RuntimeException. The dialog is a question dialog.

Second problem: the message now says "Selection does not cover a set of 
statements".
