Build Path dialog opened for wrong project if element from external JAR is selected

0815 problem with parents of elements from external JARs.
This is a general issue for all our actions (e.g. all wizards might have wrong
selection if opened based on an element from an external JAR).

Not sure if we should start changing things for 2.1.

The wizard show a list of all projects and the selected one is pre-checked. But 
the build path dialogs opens on that project and the user might not have a clue 
that he is changing the wrong project. We should disable the action if an 
element from a Jar is selected or we should use the widget hierarchy in this 
case.
Fixed for RC1.
