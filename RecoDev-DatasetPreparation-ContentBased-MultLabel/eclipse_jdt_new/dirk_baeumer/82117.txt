In package explorer select Show->Working Set, then Select Working Set->New and
create plugin working set named jdt  that contains at least one plugin,
org.eclipse.jdt for example, then press OK. Eclipse does not create new working
set (no messages . If I do the same from Show-> Project mode, it creates this
working set, but actually I cannot do anything useful with it. If I select this
working set in packages view, Eclipse displays empty list.  If I try to search
using plug-in working set, Eclipse immediatelly exits search mode without any
results. If I create Java or Resource working sets, all these functions work fine.

The Show Working Sets mode only appears to work for Java working sets.  Moving
to JDT for further comments.
Since we don't know anything about plugins we can't do anything useful with them. 

IMO JDT/UI should simply not accept the selection of plug-in working sets.

Wassim, what are the element types of a plug-in working set. Do they adapt to
IJavaElement ?
I never thought people would attempt to use the plug-in working set this way.
It was meant to be used in PDE contexts, such as quick selection of hand-
picked plugins on the target platform preference page and the plugins tab of 
the launch config.

Therefore, it does not adapt to IJavaElement for example.
Wassim,

I digged into it a little bit deeper and PDE must provide a IContainmentAdapter
for the plug-in working sets so that they can be used in the package explorer
and for search.

I will open a separate PR for this. The problem that plug-in working sets can't
be used when the package explorer is in working set mode is on purpose. However,
the UI should make this more clear.
The configure dialog now only allows creating Java working sets.


Plugin woirking sets work weird
