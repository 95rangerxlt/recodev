In at least the rename-refactor wizard, after the changes have been identified,
the "changes to be performed" tree's checkboxes exhibit the following behavior:

Clear a task, and expand its sub-tasks.
   check one of the sub-tasks.  This causes the super-task to be a grey
'partial-type' checkbox (expected)

   immediately clear that sub-task.  This leaves no sub-tasks selected, but the
super-task is still grey, indicating it is partially selected.

This may relate to a checkbox-tree SWT widget, rather than this dialog in
particular.
