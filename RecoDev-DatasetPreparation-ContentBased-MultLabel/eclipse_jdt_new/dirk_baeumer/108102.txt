I am using "Show->Working Sets" in the package explorer.
Some of the working sets contain the same project:

Working Set-1:
- Project-A
- Project-B
- Project-C

Working Set-2:
- Project-B
- Project-C
- Project-D

If I now double-click "Working Set-1.Project-B" "Project-B" in working set
"Working Set-2" will be expanded.
If the working set "Working Set-2" itself is not expanded it will seem as if
nothing happens, but after expanding "Working Set-2" one can see the changed
state of the project.

Double-clicking "Working Set-2.Project-B" works as expected.

The problem is two folded:

- first the StructuredViewer#handleDoubleSelect creates a structured selection
  instead of a TreeSelection (the method must be overridden in TreeViewer). So
  the package explorer doesn't know which element got double clicked

- the package explorer expands the element instead of the tree path

Moving to Platfrom/UI to fix part one. Please move back to JDT/UI so we can fix part two in PackageExplorerActionGroup#handleDoubleClick

Susan, based on Dirk.s comments it looks like our fix is in JFace...

Actually, this is a problem in the [Viewers] component, so reassigning to Boris.
Fix released >20060405. Moving to JDT/UI again.
Fixed for RC1.
