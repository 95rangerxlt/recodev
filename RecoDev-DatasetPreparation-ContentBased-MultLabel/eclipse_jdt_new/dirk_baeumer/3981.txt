	1. create a file A.B.java (rename a normal cu in the navigatr)
	2. in the package view - try renaming to A.java
	3. there's  bug in jcore so you'll see a crash recovery dialog.
		1GF98R4: ITPJUI:WINNT - why is a file A.B.java seen as a compilation unit?
	4. press undo
	5. note: the file is renamed anyway

NOTES:

	This is the correct behavior. What the crash recovery tries to do is to undo all changes that have been processed without any error.
	The change that procudes the error can't be undone since it has not completed.

	I opt to enhance the message so that it is clear that only the successfully executed changes are undone.

AK (8/14/2001 2:38:00 PM)
	ok for me - as long as the name (IChange::getName()) of the failed change is also displayed
