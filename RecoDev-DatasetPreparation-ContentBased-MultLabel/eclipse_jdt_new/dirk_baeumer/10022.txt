If "Build" action in the context sensitive popup menu in the Java perspective 
is always enabled. Even if the user goes to Preferences -> Workbench and 
selects "Perform build automatically on resource modification" the build menu 
option still appears in the Java popup menus.

I believe this is incorrect. No need for a manual build if the build is already 
done, automatically.

we are inconsistent with the workbench here. the build action should not be 
contributed when auto build is on.
