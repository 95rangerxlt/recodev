One common test in help docs / welcome is to test whether a particular product is running. Unfortunately I can't use the eclipse.product property as it's not API and not available in dev mode, so we need a property tester that handles it.

I will supply a patch.

patch

For the unit test, I couldn't test based on the active product because I don't want to make assumptions about our test environment. However, I did test against a product I know isn't running.
Hi Dirk, could you apply this patch for M5?
Curtis, thanks again for the patch. One question. Shouldn't the test case read:

<not>
  <test 
    property="org.eclipse.core.runtime.product"    
    value="org.eclipse.core.expressions.invalid.product.name"/>
</not>

The implementation is testing against the expectedValue.
