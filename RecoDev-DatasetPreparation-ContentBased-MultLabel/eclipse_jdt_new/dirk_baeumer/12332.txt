this throws a IOException

Icon i = new ImageIcon(ResourceUtil.resourceUrl(name));

Surround with try/catch results in

Icon i = new ImageIcon(ResourceUtil.resourceUrl(name));
try {
} catch(IOException e) {
}

If i do the same with a least 2 lines all works fine.

Now it works again with just one line.
Will report if i see it again.
I've observed the same problem in 0321, but it is not always reproduceable. 

The problem is that the exception is thrown in an initializer of a declaration. 
It has nothing to do if you select one line.
Fixed in build > I20020425


Surround with try-catch fails if just one line is selected
