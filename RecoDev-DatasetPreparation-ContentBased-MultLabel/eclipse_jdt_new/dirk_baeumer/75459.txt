Version: 3.1.0
Build id: 200409291200

When I create a new Eclipse Java project and then Open Type (Ctrl-F3), the
classes of the new project don't show up in the dialog. I have to restart my
Eclipse for this to take place.

A reverse situation is also true. After deleting a project, the types of the
deleted project still show up in the Open Type dialog. The only disappear after
restarting Eclipse.

BTW, when entering this report, the highest version number I could under the JDT
'product' was 3.0,  however I'm reporting a bug against a 3.1 integration build.
