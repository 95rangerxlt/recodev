I have non-default colors set for syntax highlighting in Java editor (black 
background, white text, yellow reserved words, green comments, ...). However 
this causes the some important Eclipse UI features to become unusable due to 
the fact they leave white (default) background but use my custom (non-default) 
foreground colors. For my choice of colors these features don't show anything!

I've seen this problem since 2.0.0 and seems like it has not been reported and 
still reproducible in 2.1.2.

Here is the list of "misbehaving" UI features:
1) Preferences | Java | Code Formatter | "New Lines" tab;
2) Source | Externalize Strings... | "Context: " view;
3) There may be other places that unconditionally use default background to 
display/preview java code.
