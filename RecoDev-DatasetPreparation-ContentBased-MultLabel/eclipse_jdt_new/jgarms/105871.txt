We should review the compilation participant APIs.  In particular, we should: 

1.  Change the APT's use of the post-reconcile event to be pre-reconcile (at 
some point, I changed this to notify before the bulk of reconcile happened, 
but never updated the event name.  This should be modified in 
AptCompilationParticipant.java, and this should be changed in the 
ReconcileWorkingCopyOperation.  

2.  Make sure that any compilation-participant events that are defined are 
actually being fired.  Right now, we've defined a few of these, but the only 
ones that are wired up are pre-build, post-reconcile (should be named pre-
reconcile), and the clean event.  The one event that is defined that is not 
wired up is post-build.  We should either remove this or wire it up properly.

Fixed as suggested: events were deleted or renamed as appropriate.
