Since the APT plugins require a JRE >= 1.5, they should use an explicit Execution Environment "J2SE-1.5" for their system library. This would allow users to check out the apt plug-ins without having to set their default JRE to 1.5 or change the projects' JREs manually.

To configure this, select the JRE System Library in the Package Explorer and choose "Configure..." from the context menu. Then select "Execution Environment" and "J2SE-1.5".

Thanks for the bug report!


Use Execution Environment to denote JRE System Library
