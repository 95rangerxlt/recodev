The source for mirrorapi.jar in org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core does not seem to be available. It would be nice if at least the Javadoc Location could be set on the jar:

mirrorapi.jar > context menu > Properties > Javadoc location: set "Javadoc URL" to
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/
