Test case:

public class TestClass {
	public TestClass() {
	}
}

public class UseTestClass {
	public void foo() {
		new TestClass();
	}
}

- select new TestClass in UseTestClass#foo
- the needed static method createTestClass isn't inserted into TestClass

This was actually two issues. First, there are two top-level public classes in 
this example, which prevents the constructor call binding from resolving to 
anything. Second, the refactoring wasn't handling expression statements 
properly, which is now fixed. There are now JUnit testcases for both issues.


Introduce Factory: doesn't generate factory method
