- auto-build off
- new Java project Test
- change output folder to be Test/bin
- new Java class Test/Test.java
- new file Test/Test.txt
- full build of Test
- delete bin folder (in workspace)
- incremental build of Test
- it recreates bin folder, but it's empty

I've also just saw it (in a self hosting situation) where it regenerated the class files, but did not re-copy the resources.
This is what I was trying to reproduce here, but in this case it's not even regenerating the class files.
Not sure what the difference is.

The bin folder is not a managed source folder so why should deleting it cause 
an incremental build.

Any change to one of the source files did rebuild properly.


Incremental build doesn't work if bin deleted (1GHH6U9)
