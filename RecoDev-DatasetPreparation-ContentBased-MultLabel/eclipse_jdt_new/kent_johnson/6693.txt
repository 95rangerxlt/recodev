I've been unable to build since installing this version of Eclipse.  I unpacked 
the eclipse distribution on top of my existing Eclipse ... is this incorrect?

I'm going to have to revert to the older Eclipse.
We will look into this asap, for the meantime you can revert to the old Java 
builder by changing the extension point inside 
<install>/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.core/plugin.xml

and modify it to have it look as below for the Java builder section.

<!--

<!-- Java 
Builder                                                                -->
<!--

<extension 
	point="org.eclipse.core.resources.builders" 
	id="javabuilder"
	name="%javaBuilderName">
	<builder>
	<!-- old builder 
is "org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.builder.impl.JavaBuilder" -->
	<!-- new builder 
is "org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.newbuilder.JavaBuilder" -->
		<run 
class="org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.builder.impl.JavaBuilder">
		</run>
	</builder>
</extension>
Good find, the fix is to simply move the increment to the second line.
Will be fixed in next integration build.
