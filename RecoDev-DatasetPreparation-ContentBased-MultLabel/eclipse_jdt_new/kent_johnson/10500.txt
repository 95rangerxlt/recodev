We should reject the following code in 1.3 compliance mode (default):

class T {
      void foo(boolean b) {}
}

public class X {
      void foo(int i) {}
      void bar() {
            new T() {
                  {
                        foo(0); // should say that foo(boolean) isn't applicable
                  }
            };
      }
}

      void bar() {

                        foo(0); // should say that foo(boolean) isn't applicable
                  }
            };
      }
}
Here is its friend scenario which we should also reject:

class T {
      void foo(boolean b) {}
}

public class X {
      void foo(int i) {}
      void bar() {
            new T() {
                  {
                        foo(false); // should complain ambiguity
                  }
            };
      }
} 
Tuned the #getImplicitMethod behavior to match 1.3 behavior.

Kent - please double check my fix candidate (released inside HEAD, post v_230).

Fixed


Shouldn't ignore inherited method with wrong argument types
