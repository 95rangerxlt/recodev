	i have 22'000 errors in my workspace (.classpath issues)
	i have been waiting for 25 minutes now to update the task list after building.
	the memory usage in up to 280 MB
		how much memory does one task list entry need? 2k?

NOTES:

	the fact that 22'000 errors are created isn't helpful to the user.
	can JCORE have a threshold of problems reported against a project.
