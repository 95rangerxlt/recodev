I've found the problem. My installation was messed up, almost 
certainly due to my user error.

(It's somewhat surprising that a rebuild all didn't mark all classes as 
problematic though.)


IMO the error missing java.lang.Object should be more prominent in the UI. It 
is not enough to
mark one file. This gives the impression that only that file has errors.

	When Object is not found, the compiler aborts from a full build 
avoiding unnecessary error reporting. This usually indicates a classpath issue, 
and
	if indicating invalid classpath entries (markers) then we can improve 
the user perception.

We should probably refuse to build anything and remove all other java problems 
on this one project, this way the classpath problem would stand out.
This is actually a good solution for the problem
Now we remove all problems associated with the project except for the class 
path error, and add an error on the project:

"The project was not built since its classpath is incomplete, fix the classpath 
then rebuild it"


Missing java.lang.Object should produce a more prominent compiler error (1GIT277)
