	SearchableEnvironment::findType(char[], char[][])
	creates new String objects. the result is that, furher down the line, NameLookup.nameMatches 
	spends lots of time converting to lowercase (String.toLowercase), which acctually creates more String objects

NOTES:

AK (5/9/01 8:15:54 PM)
	note that String constructor together with toLowerCase account for more than 35% of search time 
	(that's what 'OptimizeIt' says).
	i'm not sure but maybe some of this could be avoided by not creating the strings and just using the char[]

	toLowercase/toUppercase invocations should be fixed  by now.
	However need to investigate some more the environment implementation.

Fixed.
Wrong pr.
This one is along the path of name environment char to String performance tweak 
you are investigating for the builder environment.

Can you please look at this one too ?
Made a few minor changes. Looks fine.


SearchableEnvironment - converts char[] to String, which affects performance (1GDGIUP)
