	The problem count is only updated in the UI once / big compile loop.  This tends to be once every 1000 resources, which is too 
	unfrequent normally.  The current implementation notices if problems are being fixed or introduced.  This is useful user information
	but is hard to compute.  It would be acceptable to just provid problem delta information (per CU?)

	We clearly need to improve our progress reporting.

Closed - with the new builder, the problem count is updated as each compilation 
unit stores its problems.
