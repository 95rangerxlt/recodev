Is on the plan for 3.0
I guess it is the came thing(?): 

When using the 'create method'-quickfix to generate a method that takes one or 
more parameters, and then renaming the initial parameternames using the 
template mode (e.g. myMethod(int i, int j, int k) --> myMethod(int par1, int 
par2, int par3)), the automatically generated JavaDoc is not updated 
accordingly.
Soren: No, that's a problem with the 'create method'-quickfix and LinkedUI, and
it has nothing to do with the rename parameter refactoring.

Please file a separate bug against JDT/UI. Thanks.
Hi Markus, thanks.

I've now added 58814 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=58814)
Javdoc is now correctly updated in cases like

	/**
	 * TODO Auto-generated Javadoc stub
	 * @param i
	 */
	public void foo(int i) {
		
	}

Since you can't refer to other locals updating Javadoc can only be done using 
a textual replace. There are no plans to support textual updating for locals 
for 3.0.
References in javadoc @param tags are updated now. If you want to ask for
textual updating in the Rename Local Variable refactoring, please open a
separate enhancement request.
