The new option added for the fix in bug 163194 should be exposed into the JDT/UI.
The option will only be used if the compliance is greater or equals to 1.6. I don't think the option should be visually disabled if the compliance is not 1.6.

The JDT/Core option name is:
org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCore.COMPILER_PB_MISSING_OVERRIDE_ANNOTATION_FOR_INTERFACE_METHOD_IMPLEMENTATION

Fixed in HEAD. The option is not disabled depending on compliance, but like other sub-options, it's disabled if the main option is set to 'Ignore'.
