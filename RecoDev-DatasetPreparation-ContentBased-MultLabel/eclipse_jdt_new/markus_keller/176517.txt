Follow-up to bug 134257:

The default JRE for new Java projects should be an Execution Environment. With VM installs, this was not possible, since they were not properly shareable. But nowadays, having a project-specific EE (with correct compiler compliance, see also bug 176516) has only advantages.

We should even remove the 'Use default JRE' option on the new Java Project wizard. That's only non-portable and dangerous and is never useful.
With the fix for bug 176516, EEs are now the first option in the New Java Project wizard.

The EE is also the default choice (only first time, after that we remember the last choice again).


[build path] Execution Environment should be default for new Java projects
