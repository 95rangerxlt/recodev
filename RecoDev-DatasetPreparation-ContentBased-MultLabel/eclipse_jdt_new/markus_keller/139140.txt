Currently, the compare results dialog (in the Failure Trace view) is modal which means that I can't copy&paste several typos from it back into the source code.

Currently, the compare results dialog (in the Failure Trace view) is modal which means that I can't copy&paste several typos from it back into the source code.
Nice suggestion.

We would have to make sure that the dialog is updated when another test is selected, and that it doesn't behave bad when the JUnit View loses focus or gets closed.
How about converting it into a view? Users are used to the fact that the view doesn't change when it's not linked and (s)he selects some new element.

That would also solve the anoying overlap problem (the dialog overlaps some arbitrary part of the Eclipse window).
A speparate "JUnit Failure Compare" view would be overkill. The dialog was chosen because presenting the compare editor inside the JUnit view would require most users to resize the view in order to see something useful.

An ordinary compare editor (opens in the editor area like the History view's compare editors) would probably be a more "eclipsish" UI.
I would like to have this view where the Console is: This way, I can switch editors above and keep the compare view visible all the time.

Ok, I could split the editor area but I would have to do this all the time, so I would prefer this view to stick to the part below the editor area.

Made the dialog non-modal for next week's integration build.
