I selected several packages in a Jar that is on the build path and tried to copy their names to the clipboard, but Edit > Copy was disabled.

Copy should work for all elements in the Package Explorer and just fill the clipboard with whatever is available (e.g. name only for files from jars, etc.).

Agree, I ran into that many times. Copy should always be available, at least to copy names into the clipboard
Fixed in HEAD.
