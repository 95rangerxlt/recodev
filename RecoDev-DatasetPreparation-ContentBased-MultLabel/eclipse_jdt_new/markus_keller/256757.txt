In a new class in jdt.ui, create a method and type 'Assert.isNo' and invoke content assist. You get 3 indistinguishable proposals for isNotNull(Object) in class Assert (bug 161242). 2 of the 3 classes are even deprecated, but this is not visible in the proposals list.

Proposals that import a type as side effect should also be rendered as deprecated if the type to import is deprecated (not only if the member itself is deprecated).

Agree.
Fixed in CompletionProposalLabelProvider.
