This is a bug that only occurs when the user runs a single JUnit 4 test by selecting the test method name and chosing "Run As JUnit Test" from the context menu.

If a @BeforeClass method is defined that throws an exception, the JUnit view shows a tree like this:

-test method
-"Unrooted Tests"
  |-test class

None of the nodes are marked with crosses or ticks and none of them show a Failure Trace.

I would expect to see a tree like this:

- Test method [X]

Or maybe one like this:

-Test class [X]
|-Test method

Either way I would expect to see a red cross somewhere in the tree and be able to click on it to bring up the stack trace for the exception.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;

public class BugExample {
    @BeforeClass
    public static void beforeClass() {
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }

    @Test
    public void test() throws Exception {
    }
}

1. Make sure you have JUnit4 on the project classpath.
2. Create the class above in the default package.
3. Select the name of the method named "test".
4. Right-click, Run As, JUnit Test.
5. Open the JUnit view and expand the "Unrooted Tests" node.

You should find three nodes, none of them marked with crosses or ticks and no Failure Trace associated with any of them.

Fix is to remove the early return in TestRunSession.TestSessionNotifier#testFailed(..)

I cannot add this to a better node in the tree, since the failure occurs in a test element that is not part of JUnit4's Description tree, and I don't know to which test it belongs.
Fixed in HEAD.
