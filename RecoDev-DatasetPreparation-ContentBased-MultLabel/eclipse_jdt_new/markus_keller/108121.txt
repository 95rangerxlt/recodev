I20050823-0800 + plug-in export

I like the new feature which generates the Java elements when pasting code
snippets into the Package Explorer. Of course I tried to paste onto an empty
Package Explorer and it did not work. I'd like to create a new project when
pasting code snippet on Package Explorer where no project is selected.

I like the new feature which generates the Java elements when pasting code
snippets into the Package Explorer. Of course I tried to paste onto an empty
Package Explorer and it did not work. I'd like to create a new project when
pasting code snippet on Package Explorer where no project is selected.
What would be the name of such a project ?
To be honest I don't care about the name as long as it is not an existing one ;-) 

It should be <baseName> for the first project and then <baseName> + ' ' + n
where n starts with 2. The <baseName> can either be something like "Pasted
Code", "Code Snippets" or it could be a user preference.
This needs quite some guesswork:

- project name?
-> _pasted_TypeName_*, where * is counted up until the project does not exist

- create a source folder?
-> take default for new projects

- compiler compliance / JRE?
-> default may not be enough for 5.0 code, so take the latest JRE available?

- project dependencies (JUnit, SWT, ...)?
-> can't detect requirements -> no dependencies
>- project name?
>-> _pasted_TypeName_*, where * is counted up until the project does not exist
Almost. The first should be _pasted_TypeName_ and then add the numbers. Also
note that I might paste more than one type.

>- create a source folder?
>-> take default for new projects
Yep.

>- compiler compliance / JRE?
>-> default may not be enough for 5.0 code, so take the latest JRE available?
Default is OK as a first start. Using the latest is cool though

>- project dependencies (JUnit, SWT, ...)?
>-> can't detect requirements -> no dependencies
Correct. Otherwise you should also detect eclipse dependencies ;-)
Fixed in HEAD.
