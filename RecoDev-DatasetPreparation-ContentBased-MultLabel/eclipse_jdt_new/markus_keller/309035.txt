According to Javadoc, ITestElement.getTestResult(boolean) should return ITestElement.Result.IGNORED for ignored/skipped tests. But the current implementation returns a result of OK and only sets the 'ignored' property in TestCaseElement, which is internal API.

Optimally, the implementation of TestCaseElement.getTestResult(boolean) should be fixed to return an IGNORED result. Failing that due to backward compatibility concerns, isIgnored() should be added to the interface.
