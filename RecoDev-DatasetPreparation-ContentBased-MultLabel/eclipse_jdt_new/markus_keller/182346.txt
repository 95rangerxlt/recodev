Build 3.3M6

When refactoring code, it is possible to have dependent code in binary form, which would have been affected by the refactoring. 
Currently, these are silently skipped.

It would be nice to surface this information to the user, indicating that some sites couldn't modified (here is the list...). So that a user could take the appropriate steps to fetch these as sources and repeat the refactoring (using script) for these.

When refactoring code, it is possible to have dependent code in binary form, which would have been affected by the refactoring.

It would be nice to surface this information to the user, indicating that some sites couldn't modified (here is the list...). So that a user could take the appropriate steps to fetch these as sources and repeat the refactoring (using script) for these.
Basically, some users want to be able to perform a refactoring and find out that 20 dependent binary projects got impacted, out of 1000 projects in their workspace. Which means they need to get these as sources, and so on...
Reference search currently only works in binaries if source is attached (bug 127442) and the classpath is correct (does e.g. not suffer from bug 73957).

I think it would be confusing if we started to flag references in binaries but the feature does not work reliably. Depends on progress in bug 127442.
Bug 102279 will probably also hit us here, since the search scope will grow if we include binary references.

UI-wise, we need a way to get all the additional problems out of the refactoring wizard error page (otherwise, the user would have to write down all the affected binary projects).
Created attachment 92382
Step 1

First cut released to HEAD for Rename Type refactoring:
Collects references in binaries and shows them as error.

TODO:
- add button to move matches to Search view
- add support to other refactorings
Martin has added the button to show binary matches as search result.
Fixed and added tests for most important refactorings.

Note that some scenarios currently don't work due to blocking bugs (does not work without source attachments, Change Method Signature does not work for constructors).
