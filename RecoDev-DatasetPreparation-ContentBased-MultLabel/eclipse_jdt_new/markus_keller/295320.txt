I have a method like this, string is unused to I went to use the refactor chanage method signature (using shift+alt+c) to remove it.

private static <E extends Exception> void foo(final String string) throws E {
}

If you try this in my build of eclipse you always get an error, interesting bit of the stack included:-

java.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.TypeParameter cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jdt.core.IType
	at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.structure.ChangeSignatureProcessor.createExceptionInfoList(ChangeSignatureProcessor.java:782)
	at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.structure.ChangeSignatureProcessor.checkInitialConditions(ChangeSignatureProcessor.java:759)
	at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.RefactoringExecutionStarter.startChangeSignatureRefactoring(RefactoringExecutionStarter.java:184)

If you do this via the toolbar refactor menu rather than directly using the keyboard shortcut as I tend to then you don't see an error dialog but an error is still logged.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As per details.

As per details.
The exception java element is not necessarily a IType. In this case it is a ITypeParameter. Its erasure's java element is an IType though.
So it cannot be cast to IType without a check.
Moving to JDT/UI.
