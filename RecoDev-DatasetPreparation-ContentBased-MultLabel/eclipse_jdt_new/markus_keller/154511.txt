Moving multiple files calls validate edit on all files. To be correct, it should only call validateEdit on files that also change (for example CU's where the package statement is changed).

*** Bug 157827 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The test case looks wrong to me. It moves cu1 and file from org.test to org.test, which is not possible to do in the UI.

When I change otherFragment to org.test2, or when I create otherFragment in another source folder, then everything is fine.

Moving to 3.4 to fix and enable the test case (make two versions: move to org.test2 and move to src2/org.test).
seems to be fixed in I20071127. Test enabled again.


[reorg] Move should only do validateEdit on files that really changed
