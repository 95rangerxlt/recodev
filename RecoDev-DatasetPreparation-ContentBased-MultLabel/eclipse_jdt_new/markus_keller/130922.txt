That these fields are created final has been there for quite a while (maybe 3.0). I even think to have an error here is a good thing, as you really also have to initialize the field in the other constructor/
I agree with Markus. This got broken by fix for bug 42328.

People who want their fields 'final' can use the Save Action.
Thanks Dani for the tip! All this time I thought it was just me that was bugged by this. :D
The field is not made final any more, unless the class has only a single constructor and the "Add final modifier to private fields" cleanup is enabled as Save Action.
