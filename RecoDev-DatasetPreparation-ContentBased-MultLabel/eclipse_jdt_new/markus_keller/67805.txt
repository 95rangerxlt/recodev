Open a Java editor and choose 'Navigate > Show In > Package Explorer'. The
Package Explorer is shown and the right element is selected. Nevertheless,
there's a Display#beep() which should only occur when the element could not be
shown.

The problem is that PackageExplorerPart#revealAndVerify(..) sets the selection
(converting the given editor input file into an IJavaElement) and then compares
the new selection to the given file to determine success. This test obviously
fails when the selection is not a file but a CU. That's why the beep is issued.

Annoying, but not critical.
An easier fix is to just check whether the selection is empty after trying to
select the element:

    private boolean revealAndVerify(Object element) {
    	if (element == null)
    		return false;
    	selectReveal(new StructuredSelection(element));
    	return ! getSite().getSelectionProvider().getSelection().isEmpty();
    }

Fixed.
