From bug 134257 comment 2:

When a Java project is bound to an EE (via JRE container), changing
the EE should update the compliance setting. For example, I had a project bound
to J2SE1.5, and later changed it to J2SE1.4. The compliance settings remained
at 5.0 - I was confused when I could not run programs on a 1.4 VM due to
incompatible settings (i.e. running 1.5 code on 1.4 VM). I expected that the
compliance settings would have updated automatically.

Best would be a setting on the Compiler properties page that links the compiler compliance to the EE of the project (caveat: there's currently no default EE for a workspace).

The problem is again that JDT/Core does not know about EEs, so JDT/UI would have to listen to classpath changes to update the compiler settings.

Who is changing the workspace settings according to the VM used when the workspace starts ?
It's done in the launching plug-in. They detect the installed JRE and then set the corresponding compliance options.

Fix
Fixed in HEAD.

We now set the compliance options from the EE whenever a new EE is added to the classpath in the UI.
