Move the ExecutionEnvironment of the following plug-ins to J2SE-1.5:

org.eclipse.jdt.ui
org.eclipse.jdt.junit
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.refactoring
org.eclipse.jdt.text.tests
To avoid too many false warnings, I will run a few clean-ups (e.g. add @Override) and the Infer Generic Type Arguments refactoring.

Too late for M1, since all changes need to be carefully verified and have the potential to break the build.
I've 1.5-ified org.eclipse.jdt.junit. Previous version was tag v20100810-0800.

This patch converts the test projects to 1.5 (just sets the compliance options and disables generics-related warnings). Without this, new JUnit launch configurations are created with a 1.4 VM and fail at run time because jdt.junit is already generified.

Released to HEAD.
I've seen some more spurious errors in like bug 305259 in the test projects. Filed bug 323855 for the new issues.
I'm making progress on converting jdt.ui, but I still have some wrongly inferred type arguments (mainly because the DOM AST is not yet generic). The AST and ASTRewrite APIs are also the main source for unavoidable type safety warnings which make it hard to see the real type safety problems (bug 322817).
Fixed in HEAD (right after tag v20110301-0630_before15 in org.eclipse.jdt.ui).
