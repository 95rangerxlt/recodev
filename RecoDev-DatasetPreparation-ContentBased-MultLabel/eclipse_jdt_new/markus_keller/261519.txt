The following gives a dead code warning in the last line, because of the "if (true)" line above it:

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	new Main().go();
}
boolean go() {
	if (true) return true;
	return true; // dead code here
}
}

However if I comment out the dead code line then the method is marked with an error for possibly not returning a boolean value (the "if (true)" line isn't good enough).  Is the "if (true)" line considered safe enough to return a value (in which case there shouldn't be an error) or not (in which case there shouldn't be a dead code warning)?

First: "if(true)" is considered to be an obvious mistake, as opposed to "if(DEBUG)" which uses a toggle.

In your case, the proper fix is not to just delete the dead line, but also to remove the IF control (i.e. promote the THEN block out).


I'll adjust the quick fix to also remove the condition in this case.
Fixed the quick fix in HEAD.

(In reply to the riddle from comment #0)
There are two parties that decide about "safe enough" here.

The error for the missing return statement is required by the Java Language Specification (JLS).
=> JLS does not trust "if (true)" for result path analysis.

But the JLS also requires your original code to compile. To make the user aware of the dead code, we added a warning.
=> The additional Eclipse warning trusts "if (true)", because the successive statements are indeed dead.
