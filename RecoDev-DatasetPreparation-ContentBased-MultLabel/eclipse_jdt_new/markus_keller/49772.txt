Consider the code from above and change the signature of 
getCorrespondingElement to return Object. If you press preview you get an 
refactoring error telling me that the import isn't used. Since we already 
detect this case we should remove the import.

I know that this might introduce inconsistencies with other refactorings but 
getting this error message is even worse.

The error is only shown if "unused imports" compiler setting is "error". Agree
that we shouldn't flag the error, but automagically correct it (even if it's
just a warning).
Fixed in head. Uses new ImportRemover and CompilationUnitRewrite.
