Enable 1.7 compiler compliance in the UI (revert bug 309163).
Workaround in 3.6 builds is to set the following options in
.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs
to 1.7 manually:

org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.codegen.targetPlatform=1.7
org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.compliance=1.7
org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source=1.7

The copyright in ComplianceConfigurationBlock should point to 2010, shouldn't it ?

Yep, fixed that and committed to HEAD. You will see wrong version warnings and a wrong default compliance for JavaSE-1.7 EE/VMs until bug 321043 and
bug 321044 are fixed as well.
We need to remove this for 3.7 and then set target to 3.8.

Done. See patch in bug 342391.

To enable again simply set
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.util.JavaModelUtil.HIDE_VERSION_1_7 to 'false';
Removed JavaModelUtil.HIDE_VERSION_1_7 and references with
