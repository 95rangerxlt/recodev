I have simplified the API for structure creation for compare (see bug 162561).
I will attach a patch that converts the Java and properties structure creators to use this new API. The old API is deprecated and, since it was added in 3.3, will be removed once all the clients in the SDK have committed the patches. The API change also adds progress monitoring to the API.

Patch

There were some changes to support progress monitoring on the
StructuredDiffViewer side as well. The latest patch includes these as well as
the original changes
Thanks for the patch. Released attachment 54551 to HEAD.
