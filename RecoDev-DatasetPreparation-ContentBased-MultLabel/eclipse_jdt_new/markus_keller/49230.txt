See work done for Bug 46926

Using the change method signature refactoring as suggested in Bug 46926:
1. Click on 'Add' to add a new parameter
2. Click away from the new line so that it is not selected
There is now an empty line in the table.
The result is an error saying 'Enter the type for the new parameter' but there is (apparently) nothing 
in the table. You can click the first line of the table and remove it but its possibly confusing.

I suggest that if the user clicks away from the new line without entering anything, the line should 
be removed from the table.

Just noticed that its possible to have several empty lines if 'Add' is clicked more than once.
I preferr filling in some "default values". This is in line with other new 
actions.

Markus, this goes together with the Cancel issue reported by Tom.

Fixed > 2004-01-05: added parameter is now 'int newParam', default == 0.
