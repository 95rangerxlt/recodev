Ideally I could use content assist during a rename refactoring as I normally do when adding a field to generate a standardized name.  For instance, while adding a field of type ClassA, I can type "ClassA", space, then invoke content assist and choose the field name "classA".  However, invoking content assist during rename refacoring does not function at all.


Reproducible: Always

Fix

This already works for the 'Rename in File' quick assist.

The patch also enables it for the Rename refactoring in the editor (and makes sure the refactoring popup appears again after the completion list is closed)
Fixed in HEAD.
