I20050405-0800 + ZRH plugin export

Tabbing through the table items of a newly created parameter does not select 
the entire text of the table item anymore, but places the cursor at the end of 
the item text.

While this is certainly convenient in the new type wizard, the old behavior is 
more appropriate for change method signature, extract method and introduce 
parameter.

Fixed in HEAD.

Full cell selection behavior restored for refactoring dialogs. Still setting
caret to end of cell after adding interfaces in new type wizard.
