Make a random selection in a Java editor and choose 'Use supertype where possible'
The dialog comes up and is ready to do some work. But it dosn't say which for
type it would use a supertype for. Maybe the label should be improved to 
'Select supertype to use for '{0}':'
It might be better to limit the enablement on type references or type elements.

The genarlize type refactoring has the same problem; it does't tell you which
type it will generalize.
Markus, we should improve this for 3.1.
Fixed in both wizards.
