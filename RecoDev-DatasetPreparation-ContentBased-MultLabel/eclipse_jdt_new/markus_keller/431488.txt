The dialog for selection of filters doesn't retain the previous selection. Is this by design?

Yes, the idea is that you either
- refine the last query by selecting it from the Combo again
   => previous selection is retained
or
- perform a new search on a new target element
   => initial selection is always 'References', and if you need a different kind of fine-grain search, then its not necessarily the same as the last time. 'Match locations' is just a dialog because there are too many options for the main page. If there were not so many options, then we would just have shown them directly on the Java Search page (all disabled by default).
