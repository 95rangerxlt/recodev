Clear history action suggests that past (already terminated) testruns are cleared from the testrun history, but instead the action terminates and removes all active and inactive testruns.

I suggest to either implement the action to only clear terminated testruns from the history or rename it to something like "Terminate All and Remove" with an icon resembling the ones from debug.

Fixed in HEAD. Also renamed the action to "Remove Terminated Test Runs" to make the effects clear.
