The black arrows pointing to the upper-left (or lower-right) carry
redundant information on every node. It's enough to display the
hierarchy mode in the title and the view toolbar. This would remove some
noisyness from the tree and free overlay space for more useful information
such as recursivity and multiple occurrence indicators (

Removed the caller and callee label decorations

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.ui.

Sorry, I just couldn't wait until next week :-)

The "caller" and "callee" decorations are removed. You can also remove the
caller_co.gif and callee_co.gif files from the icons.
Thanks, Jesper.

I also removed the method MethodWrapper#getDirection() and the associated
constants since they were only used by
CallHierarchyLabelDecorator#computeAdornmentFlags(). Please speak up if that's
not OK for you.
