build i0226, winxp, j9sc20031212

I was moving a class definition from an interface to a class and I got an
exception. Will attach log file.

example structure:

package api;
public interface IFoo {
  public class Node {
    ...
  }
  public class INode {
  ...
  }
}

package internal;
public class Foo {
  ...
}

I moved the declaration of "Node" to "Foo" via the context menu in the outline
view. (Refactor -> Move)
