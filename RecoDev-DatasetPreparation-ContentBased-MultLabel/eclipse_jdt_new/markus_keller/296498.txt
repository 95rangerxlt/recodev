1. Create a JUnit test.
2. Put a test method in it.
3. Run it. The test passes, everyone's happy.
4. Make the editor dirty by typing stuff in it.
5. Try to run the same test from the 'JUnit' view.
6. A 'Save Resource' prompt appears, hit the 'ESC' key to cancel.
7. The 'Save and Launch' prompt appears. Dismiss it. The launching operation should've just been canceled completely.
8. Redo step 5.
9. Redo step 6 but click the 'Cancel' button.
10. Same result as step 7.
11. Redo step 5.
12. Redo step 6 but click the 'No' button.
11. Same result as step 7. The prompt should not have appeared as I already said 'No'.
