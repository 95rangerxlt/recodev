The change made in IntroduceParameterObjectProcessor for fixing bug 33737 caused IntroduceParameterObjectTests.testInlineRename() to fail.

I've reverted it.
Fixed in HEAD.

The reason for the change in bug 33737 was that Introduce Parameter Object did not create the CU for the parameter object class when the user went back from the preview and then executed the refactoring again.
