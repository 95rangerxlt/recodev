public class A {
	void m() {
		int i= 1 + 2;
	}
}

Select "1 + 2" and choose Refactor > Extract Local Variable.
Result has a newline too much:

public class A {
	void m() {
		
int j= 1 + 2;
		int i= j;
	}
}

I noticed that as well. Markus can you please investigate. I think the problem 
is that this doesn't use the AST rewriter yet and the new formatter has a 
different tab insertion handling.
Can't reproduce with jdt-ui and jdt-core from head. Will have to check with next
I-build.
Fixed in HEAD.

This only happened if code formatter option
"org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.blank_lines_before_first_class_body_declaration"
was set to 1 (Default [built-in] is 0).

The variable declaration statement was formatted with
CodeFormatter.K_CLASS_BODY_DECLARATIONS instead of CodeFormatter.K_STATEMENTS.
