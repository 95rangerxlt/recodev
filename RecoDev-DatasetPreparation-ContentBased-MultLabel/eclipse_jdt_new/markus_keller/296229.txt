The {@code} tag is always prepended by a space when Javadoc is displayed.
For example, the text "non-{@code null}" is rendered as "non- null".

This is not the case in Javadoc generated by e.g. the javadoc tool.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Javadoc comment
2. Type a sentence that contains a {@code} block immediately preceded by some other text.
3. View the Javadoc and observe the inserted space.
