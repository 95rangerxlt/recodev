Content Assist is available for the superclass in M7.
However it also lists interfaces. If an interface is selected,
the generated class "extends" it instead of "implementing" it.

Fixed in HEAD.

Content Assist now shows the same proposals as when invoked after the "extends"
keyword in a source file. Interfaces are still shown, but with a lower relevance
(lower in the list), e.g.:

    class X extends Run<content_assist_here> {}

... results in proposals:
- class Runtime
- class RuntimeException
- class RuntimePermission
- interface Runnable
- ...

If you don't like this behavior, please file a new bug against jdt core.
