Automatic generation of GETTER and SETTER methods don´t use configured naming conventions.

for example.

i configured "par" as a prefix for parameter values.

for the field:

		private Long   invoiceId ;
		
the generated SETTER looks like:
		
		public void setInvoiceId ( Long invoiceId )
		{
			this.invoiceId = invoiceId ;
		}
		
but it should :

		public void setInvoiceId ( Long parInvoiceId )
		{
			this.invoiceId = parInvoiceId ;
		}
