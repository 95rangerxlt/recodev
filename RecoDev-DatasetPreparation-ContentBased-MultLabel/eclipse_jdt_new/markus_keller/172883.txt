'Open Type' is an essential tool which has to be in good quality for a stable build.

We need to revert the code for 'Open Type' but will leave all other type selection dialogs use the new story. This allows us to test the new story at less prominent places.

Patch that brings the old code back

This patch can also be used later to revert the changes again.
Markus please review and commit.
Patch looks good, thanks. Released to HEAD.
Will investigate again once the dependencies are resolved.
I switched back to the FilteredItemsSelectionDialog (see OpenTypeAction) for I20070306-0800.
