The Java structured compare editor doesn't properly format qualified types that appear as type arguments.

Example: Compare the class below with a version that has no members. The tree says that elements
  Try
    sd : Date>
    foo(int, String>)
have been added/removed.

package xy;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Set;

class Try {
	void foo(int i, ArrayList<java.lang.String> ls) {}
	Set<java.util.Date> sd;
}
