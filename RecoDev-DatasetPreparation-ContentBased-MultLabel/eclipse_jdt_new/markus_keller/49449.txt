It would be useful if the state of the 'Qualify Constant references...' checkbox was remembered 
between invocations of the extract constant refactoring.

Better yet, determine what the state of the checkbox should be based on where the extracted literal 
is extracted from. ie., if its in a static block/method, then the checkbox is unchecked, if its in an 
instance method, then its checked.
