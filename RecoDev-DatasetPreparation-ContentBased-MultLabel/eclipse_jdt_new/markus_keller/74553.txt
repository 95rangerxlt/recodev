3.1 M2 test pass

- open the java formatter preferences, 
- open a profile
- select e.g. Whitespace>Parametrized Types>Wildcards
- press Ok 

- reopen the profile
-> the last location is remembered

-> expected: also the displayed text (right hand) is changed to the correct example
-> actual: the example text for the entire tab is shown. To see the relevant
example text, I have to switch the selection in the tree.

Already wrong in 3.0.
Got fixed in M2 with fix for bug 74614.
