Build Identifier: M20110210-1200

I want to move some functionality of class A to a new composing class B.  I created a new class B, which has nothing in it.  I change A.method() to take a B as a parameter, so that I can use the instance method Move refactoring to move method() to B.  That fails with a NullPointerException, in the attached stack trace.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I tried to create a new set of classes that demonstrate this problem, but haven't been able to find whatever makes this refactoring fail in this case.  I can however reproduce it every time with my code, but confidentiality prohibits my posting that code here.

Stack trace
I checked 328554 and 328786 which seemed similar, but this stack trace is different so I assume the underlying cause is new.
Just to clarify: you do this in the Java editor, right?

> Just to clarify: you do this in the Java editor, right?

That's correct.  Refactor menu -> Move.  Select the object I want to move the method to, and hit either preview or OK, then get the error.
Snippet to reproduce (move A#foo(B) to B):

package p;
import com.example.Outer.Inner;
public class A {
	public void foo(B b) {
		Inner<String> i;
	}
}

package p;
public class B {
}

package com.example;
public class Outer {
	public static class Inner<E> {}
}
