RefactoringStatusDialog.createDialogArea could reuse the super implementation to comply with the standard layout defined in IDialogConstants

Also, the call to initializeDialogUnits is unecessary, since it is already in Dialog.createContents

Strange code found with the Code Recommender System of TU Darmstadt

Reproducible: Always

Created attachment 153709
proposed patch
The patch did not really work (e.g. 'messagePane.marginWidth= width' is wrong). After cleanup, nothing more than this line remained, and that's not enough for an iplog+ flag:
    (Composite) super.createDialogArea(parent)
