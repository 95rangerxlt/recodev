When I generate code that has JUnit as a requirement, I used to add a JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar entry to the project classpath.
Now that a JUnit container is available, I would need instead to add the JUnit container entry to the classpath. This enhancement request is about making the this container path publicly available, to allow plugins to add this container to a project classpath.
(Typically, publishing the contants org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.buildpathJUnitContainerInitializer.JUNIT?_PATH would do the trick).

Moving to JDT UI
Any update on the request?
I'll do this for 3.6.

The previous patch leaves some compile errors in o.e.jdt.ui.tests. This patch should solve the problem.

Thanks Deepak.
Forgot to tell: The new constants are in org.eclipse.jdt.junit.JUnitCore.
