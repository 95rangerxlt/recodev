Call Hierarchy doesn't show callees of method from anonymous type.
Callees of m() are correctly shown: println(String) and Runnable.
However, callees of run() are empty, although run() calls println(String).

class A {
	void m() {
		System.out.println("before");
		Runnable runnable= new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println("run");
			}
		};
		runnable.run();
	}
}
