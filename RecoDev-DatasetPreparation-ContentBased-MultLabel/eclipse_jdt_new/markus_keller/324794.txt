Build Identifier: Irrelevant

Hi

In eclipse-build (subproject of LinuxTools) we attempt to recompile eclipse completely from source. As a part of that we also want to regenerate jar-in-jar-loader.zip; to do this we have generated a custom callback hook and was wondering if you would accept it into the jdt.ui build tree.

custom callback hook

This callback hook will auto-regenerate jar-in-jar-loader.zip if it is missing. It can be extended to always regeneratign jar-in-jar-loader.zip from source (e.g. by removing jar-in-jar-loader.zip in the clean target).

~Niels
We can release this, but I'd rather keep a compiled version of jar-in-jar-loader.zip in CVS and use that by default (so the custom callback hook is a no-op by default, unless someone else removes the zip).
That would be great; we have a script to clean up the source tree before starting the build and adding jar-in-jar-loader.zip to its purge list is trivial for us.

Fix 2

The original patch didn't work (wrong file name in the <available> test).
Fixed in HEAD.
