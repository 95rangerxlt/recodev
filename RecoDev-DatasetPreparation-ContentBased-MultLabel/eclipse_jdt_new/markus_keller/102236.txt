It would be nice if after running a test the time taken by each test case, and
each test suite, was displayed to the right of the test.

[Apologies if I've guessed wrong which component to assign this to, I'm afraid I
don't get much enlightenment from the descriptions of the component at
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/describecomponents.cgi?product=JDT]

Patch to org.eclipse.jdt.junit

I have attached a fully functional patch for this feature.  It still needs NLS work and some small display issues fixing.  If you agree with the approach, i can finish it off.
Markus please comment.
I tried the patch and found a bunch of issues that would need to be resolved before we can release this:

- Need a toggle action in the view menu for this: "Show Running Time"

- Displayed time should look like " (0.012 s)" (use NumberFormat or a pattern in MessageFormat)

- Must not show empty "()" (don't add anything if time is not available) or overflows in case of failures (e.g. FailingSuite from the tests)

- Should show aggregated times for all TestSuiteElements

- Running times must be written to and read from disk (TestRunHandler / TestRunSessionSerializer). This is necessary, since terminated test runs are automatically swapped out to disk when a new test run is selected (and times are lost when the user switches back to terminated runs). See the Ant JUnit tasks for the right tag/attribute names in the XML.

- Update automated tests in the org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests plug-in, e.g. org.eclipse.jdt.junit.tests.TestRunSessionSerializationTests3. To edit the tests, you can launch a runtime Eclipse with ${workspace_loc:org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests/testresources/JUnitWorkspace} as workspace and then import the two existing projects.

Patch to org.eclipse.jdt.junit

Updated patch.  Should include all functional changes you requested.  Still needs the messages fixing up (doesn't use a message bundle yet) and i haven't figured out how to run the junit plugin tests yet.  The feature should be off by default, so shouldn't break any existing tests.

I think it may be possible to fix the tests by removing the time attribute from the result generated (after it is generated from the junit model).  Is this the correct approach, or should the xml matcher be updated to ignore the attribute?

Patch to org.eclipse.jdt.junit

Updated patch including a 'fix' in the test plugin to strip out the time attributes
Created attachment 89664
released patch

Major changes compared to previous version:
- TestCaseElement: saved some memory by using 1 field for timing instead of 3
- TestSessionLabelProvider: added locale-sensitive formatting
- measure time for suite (instead of summing up children) to include setUp()/tearDown()
- fixed tests to really test whether the 'time' attribute is there
- changed default to enabled
Released last patch to HEAD (without the unnecessary changes in the */ant/result folders).
