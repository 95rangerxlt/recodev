The expected behavior of abort is not clear to me so I'll leave that one to y'all but undo is definitely an issue. Steps to reproduce:

1. Before starting eclipse, create a folder Foo in your workspace root, parallel to other existing or about-to-be-created top-level project folders.
2. Start Eclipse
3. Create Java project Foobar. (Switch to the Java perspective if necessary).
4. Attempt to rename Foobar to Foo. Since Foo already exists on the filesystem, Eclipse complains and asks me whether I want to Undo or Abort 
5. If I hit either Undo or Abort, I end up with project name Foo. It should undo it back to Foobar. I have no idea what Abort is supposed to do.

I am on 3.2 M4 (Build id: I20051215-1506) with JDK 1.4.2_06.

Markus, can you comment?
Abort just aborts and does not try to do any changes to the workspace. Undo undos all changes that have been successfully executed before the change that failed. In the Rename Java Project refactoring, the only change is the project renaming, and if this fails, the undo is empty.

Fixed in HEAD by not allowing to rename if the target folder already exists.
