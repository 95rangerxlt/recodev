The failing test is RenameTypePerfAcceptanceTests#testCold
Filed bug 443411 for the underlying issue.

Using the System JRE on the classpath for a performance test project is obviously wrong, so I've replaced it with the stable rtstubs13.jar

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=9c3a66e93cad049528ff8e5fff9cac760d38b118
