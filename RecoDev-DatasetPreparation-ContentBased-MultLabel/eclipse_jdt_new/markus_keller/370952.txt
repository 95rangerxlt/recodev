One more little enhancement I can think of is to check the clipboard  and fill package and class name on opening "New Class Window". But that may be a little invasive and probably should be somehow customizable.

We only split automatically if the package name would be valid and the Name field was empty (or fully selected) before pasting.

We never automatically paste (e.g. since that could be a security problem).
