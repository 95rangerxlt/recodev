- enable renaming in the editor
- have the following CU:
----- Main.java ------
package org.eclipse.m5testing ;

public class Main
{
    void foobar ( )
    {
    }
    void method( )
    {
        foobar();
    }
}
---------------------

- in 'method', place the caret inside the call to 'foobar'
- press Alt+Shift+R to rename
- press Ctrl+D to delete the line with the call

> the method name is erased (ok)

- with the mouse, place the caret in the edit region (zero length) where the name of the 'foobar' method definition used to be.
- type "barfoo"

> no linked updating happens

- press <return> to finish the refactoring

> the refactoring tries to rename, fails with an error (ok) and tries to restor the original name 'foobar'. It computes a wrong offset for the original call site, resulting in corrupted source code.
