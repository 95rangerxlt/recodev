The filter "Empty parent packages" does not hide a parent package if it contains filtered .svn ressource folders. So logically they are empty but the filter does not think that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check out a project from svn in Windows 7 with TortoriseSVN
2. Import the project in eclipse (without using subclipse or subversive etc.)
3. Enable the .ressources and empty parent packages filters

Unlike bug 22202, this bug is about empty parent packages, not about empty folders or source folders.

We should fix this the same way as bug 242069.
