org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.dom.Bindings.containsTypeVariables(ITypeBinding type)

This method consists of 6 if statements in a row. The 1st and 5th if statement are the same. Therefore the 5th one is never going to get executed because the first on returns.

We should probably remove the first one. Markus, your code and call.
If you remove the first one than it looks like that method will never return true.
Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=fa654b99ec699d30cd5bf0d5387f09bb0134bb4f
