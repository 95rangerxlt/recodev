'Refactor > Create Script' should not close dialog if the script location is invalid.

I carefully selected the refactorings I wanted to export and then typed a path with a non-existing directory. When I clicked Create, I got an error message and the dialog was closed.

We should
- not close the dialog if the location is not writable
- automatically create missing parent directories

Fixed both problems.
