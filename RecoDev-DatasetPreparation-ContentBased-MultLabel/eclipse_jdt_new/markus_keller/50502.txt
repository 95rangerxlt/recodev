I have a class with abstract method. I use the change signature to change the 
signature of the method. If I delete field, I would expect it to delete the 
@param from the comment. If I add field, I would expect it to add @param with 
TODO to the comment. Also all the derived classes have javadoc with @see 
original method signature. When the refactor changes the signature of all the 
derived/implementing classes, it should update the @see with new method 
signature.

Javadoc support is currently be added. Refactoring will soon be in a position 
to use the enhanced DOM to perform source modifications inside the Javadoc area.

Moving to JDT/UI for further action. Javadoc core support is to be released for 
next integration delivery.
