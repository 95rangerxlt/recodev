Improve grouping of options on Errors/Warnings page.

"Potential programming problems" is too big and without logical order. It could be split into options that affect
- members (method signatures, serial id)
- expressions
- statements and blocks

Or we could just order them by scope.

I didn't find clear cut group boundaries, so I don't think it's worth adding new topics.

Ordered the Code style and Potential programming problems groups in rough inside-out order (from expression via statements to members).

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=72c6caf81e1db41db1c0e9982ea172b1caef14a6
Right hash is http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=e8e53568a96489ee4817e4649f1a5aa3f31fa6e7
