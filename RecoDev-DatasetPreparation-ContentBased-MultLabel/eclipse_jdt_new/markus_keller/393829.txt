Steps to reproduce:
1. Invoke "Change Method Signature" on method "a"
2. Reorder parameters "par1" and "par2" (i.e., put "par1" "Down")
3. There is an exception reported in a dialog

public class ChangeMethodSignatureBug {

    public ChangeMethodSignatureBug(Object obj) {
    }

    public void m() {
        new ChangeMethodSignatureBug(new Object() {
            public void a(Object par1, Object par2) {
            }
        });
    }
}

A nasty case! Thanks for the small example.
