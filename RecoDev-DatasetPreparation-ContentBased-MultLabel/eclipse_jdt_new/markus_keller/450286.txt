If the 'Introduce Parameter' dialog is opened for a method with a large number of parameters (~7 or more), the to-be-created parameter should be scrolled into view.

This is amazingly hard to fix. I first thought it's just bug 450391, but reverting the change for bug 442275 doesn't help here.

The problem seems to be that the selection is set before the shell has been opened. At that time, the shell and table have not been laid out, so the table didn't have to scroll to make the selection visible. Then, the table size shrinks and the selection goes out of view.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=0e9a13d30c2f6a8f0d6ff3c9268668d7ee80e989
