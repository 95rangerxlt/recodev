1. Paste the following in Package Explorer
import java.util.List;
public class X {
  boolean foo() {
    return null instanceof List; 
  }
}
2. You should get a warning: "List is a raw type. References to generic type List<E> should be parameterized"
3. Bring up Quick Fix and choose "Add type arguments to 'List'"
4. You have to choices: 
  - inserting '<?>' (valid suggestion)
  - inserting '<Object>' (invalid suggestion)

If you choose the second suggestion, the resulting code has the following error:
"Cannot perform instanceof check against parameterized type List<Object>. Use instead its raw form List since generic type information will be erased at runtime"
