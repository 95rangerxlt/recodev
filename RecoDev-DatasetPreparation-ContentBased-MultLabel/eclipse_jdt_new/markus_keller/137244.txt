JDT-UI part to fix issue in Open type described in bug 137087.

To test this, you need to apply patch https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=38802&action=view
on JDT/Core HEAD...

Scenario is:
1) Copy in clipboard pattern "Hashmap" given in bug 137087
2) Open type dialog and paste your pattern in one shot
  => with JDT/Core patch, you should get HashMap in types list
3) Set cursor at the end of string and suppress last three characters
  (eg. you only get "Hash" in type string)
  => you get many other matches: OK
4) Add again "map" at the end to retrieve initial pattern: "Hashmap"
  => you get no result in types list: KO
     Extpected behavior is to have only "HashMap" back on types list
