Using the following 2 CUs:

package test;
import static test1.B.PI;
public class A {
	public void foo() {
		double pi= PI;
	}
}

package test1;
public class B {
	public static final double PI= Math.PI;
}

when renaming the field PI (from decl. and ref.) 2 problems in the refactored
source are reported in the dialog before the refactoring is applied. The
resulting source does not have these problems.

Probably dup of bug 77619.
*** Bug 77619 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
You cannot rename PI !-)
Fixed & tests added. You can rename PI now ;-).
