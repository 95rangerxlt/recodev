The 'Move Member to New File' refactoring dialog allows you to specify the name
of the field that is created.
I think the label in the dialog is complicated: ' Entre name for enclosing
instance'. I can rename the enclosing instance?
Why not simply write: 'Field name:' The labels above already say that this is
new field created to refer to the enclosing instance.
