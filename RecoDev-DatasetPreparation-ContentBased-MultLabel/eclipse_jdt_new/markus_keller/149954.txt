Activating "Open Call Hierarchy" for a reference of a method opens additionally an editor with the function. This did not happen in past versions. It is not necessary if one looks for other references of this funtion. To open a function definition one uses easier the "hyperlink feature".

Activating "Open Call Hierarchy" for a reference of a method opens additionally an editor with the function. This did not happen in past versions. It is not necessary if one looks for other references of this funtion. To open a function definition one uses easier the "hyperlink feature".
Sample:
1. Text editor for Class B
import A;

class B {
  public void f(A a) {
      a.funcInA();
  }
}

"Open Call Hierarchy for call in B.f() opens the editor for A too.

Moving to JDT UI
The "Open Call Hierarchy" action has always opened the declaration of the selected target. However, I agree that this is not really necessary.

Changed in HEAD to only reveal the target if the editor was already open (usual behavior when a new element is selected and editor is already open).
