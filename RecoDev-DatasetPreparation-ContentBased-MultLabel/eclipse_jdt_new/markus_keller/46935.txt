In the 'Refactoring > Change Method Signature' dialog, entering the return type
as well as entering parameter type is very cumbersome.

- No browse to choose a type
- No combo for 'int', 'void' ect
- Not clear how imports are handled. Do I have to enter qualified types to get
imports, or will this result in qualified names in the code?
- No validation as you type in for parameter fields.

As this is a refactoring it looks strange that you can enter a non-existing file
name.

I would suggest that always fully qualified type are shown and that the
refactoring creates imports but uses simple names.

I agree with Martin. To support entering type names I would like to use code 
assist instead of a Browser button. Additional buttons make the UI look wired. 
We have to talk to Dani if we can reuse the code assist text entry field he 
did for find/replace.
We now have Content Assist in type fields.

Still todo:

Types can now be entered qualified or unqualified. In the CUs, they are inserted
via ImportRewrite. If a simple type name is unresolvable or ambiguous (and not
yet imported in the CU), the refactring shows an error.

Still open: No validation as you type in for parameter fields.
Closing. Remaining issue is in bug 58540.
