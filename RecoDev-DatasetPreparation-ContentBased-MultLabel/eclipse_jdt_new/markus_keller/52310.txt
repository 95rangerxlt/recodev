Moved a class from the default package and ended up with imports missing the 
last ".".

For example:

I got something like org.eclipseMovedClass instead of org.eclipse.MovedClass

Cannot reproduce. Can you provide more information:
- your eclipse build
- concrete steps to reproduce (packages / files you have, which file is moved)
Realised I saw this on my pair's machine which is M4 or M6... I'll confirm on M7.
On M7 can't seem to actually get the class in the default package to be even 
recognised...
Fixed wrong updating.

Check your java compiler compliance level. In java 1.4 and later, it is not
allowed to import types which are in the default package.
