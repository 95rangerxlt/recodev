Looks like a limitation of the ITextListener we use in RenameInformationPopup.
The text listener is OK. But the Refactor and Preview actions should be disabled initially. Fixed in HEAD.
This bug was about Undo not re-enabling the actions. Does the fix cover that scenario (see comment 0). I don't see how/why initially disabling the actions fixes the reported problem.
The underlying problem was that the actions were always enabled initially. This was confusing and I fixed it to show the real state (disabled) also initially.

The scenario in comment 1 did not show a problem with undo, but the general behavior when the name becomes the original name again (links disabled in that case).
