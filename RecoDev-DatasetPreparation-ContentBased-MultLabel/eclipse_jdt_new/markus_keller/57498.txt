The summary says it all.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with Platform-UI or 
with JDT-UI, however, the "Ctrl+Space" key doesn't work in a new class wizard 
when using the resource perspective.  In the Java perspective, it works as 
expected.  Why is this?

Happens on Windows as well. Markus, can you please have a look. I think it has 
something to do with the fact that content assist isn't available in the edit 
menu in the resource perspective ?
Content Assist in dialogs was rewritten to use the keybinding support in dialogs.

I cannot reproduce in I200404201300, which I take as a good sign that this is
fixed now. Please reopen if you can reproduce with a later build.
