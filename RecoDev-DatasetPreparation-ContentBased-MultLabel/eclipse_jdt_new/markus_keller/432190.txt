Javadoc for 1.3 and 1.4 has been archived at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/ and
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/api/
, and the individual html pages are no longer available.

http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/enterprise/deploy/shared/ActionType.html is still available, but the link to http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html also results in a 404 or timeout.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=cfe93eda3ed925aa5fdd55bee84e124eeeebda08

Default locations for 1.3 and 1.4 are now http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/ as well.
