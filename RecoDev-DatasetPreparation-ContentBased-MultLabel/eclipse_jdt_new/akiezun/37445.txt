Reporting against I20030506 build.

As of I20030422, the "Open Call Hierarchy" action worked for the method in
which the cursor was located. In the new build, it emits a confusing beep
instead of opening the call hierarchy for the current method. It works as
expected if you highlight the method's name, but the other way of invoking
it was more convenient. If the new behavior is intended, at the very least
some hint should be provided that a method selection is required, not just
a beep.

I tracked down the problem to OpenCallHierarchyAction.java:113 where
CallHierarchyUI.getCandidates is called and returns null instead of the
"current" IMethod.

Jesper, please comment
Jan,

The current implementation requires you to select a method (either a method
declaration or a method call) when invoking "Open Call Hierarchy". This is
definitely too limiting.

This should be changed to show the call hierarchy for the enclosing method if no
method has been selected. This way, it will work analogously to the "Open Type
Hierarchy" action, where the enclosing type (with the enclosing method) is
selected if a type has not been selected.

Fix for selecting enclosing method when appropriate

Adam,

Patch against JDT UI.

This patch changes the way OpenCallHierarchyAction finds the method to display.
If a method is selected, it works as previously. If not, the enclosing method
(if there is one) is automatically chosen.
Thanks for taking care of it :-)
cool, released
(it may confuse some people because the action now sometimes opens the CH for 
this and sometimes for that but let's do it and see how people react)


call hierarchy: Open Call Hierarchy beeps instead of showing info about the current method
