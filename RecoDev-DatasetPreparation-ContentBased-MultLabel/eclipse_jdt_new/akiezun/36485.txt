'Open Call Hierarchy' menu entry should be located right below 'Open Type 
Hierarchy'
If I understand correctly, this involves changing the OpenCallHierarchyAction to
look more like OpenTypeHierarchyAction and inserting a reference to it into
OpenViewActionGroup. Is this correct?
yes, i'm afraid so
i entered bug 36557 to request that this be changes

but for now, mimic the OpenTypeHierarchyAction

Fix for action handling

Patch agains the JDT UI project.

Changed the action handling to mimic that of OpenTypeHierarchyAction.

- Added a new class, OpenCallHierarchyAction, which mimics
OpenTypeHierarchyAction.
- A reference to this class is inserted into OpenViewActionGroup.
- Added a help context id for the new action.
- Added a OPEN_CALL_HIERARCHY constant in IJavaEditorActionDefinitionIds.
- Added a OPEN_CALL_HIERARCHY constant in JdtActionConstants.
- Added entries to plugin.xml and plugin.properties for the new action.
- Removed the old action settings in plugin.xml and plugin.properties.
- Removed the old OpenCallHierarchyActionDelegate class.

This change involved messing a bit around in the existing JDT code, including
something in the public API classes (constants and OpenViewActionGroup). I hope
that's OK.
can you try to create the patch again? i see everything as red

thx

I can see that something went wrong. My local copy of the patch was only half
the size. Resubmitted the patch.
