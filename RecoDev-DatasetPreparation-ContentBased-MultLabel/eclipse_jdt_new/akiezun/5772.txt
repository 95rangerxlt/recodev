1) create a JUnit project
2) drag in junit.jar from the file system
3) add junit.jar to the build path
4) delete junit.jar in the packages view
->the junit.jar now shows up as an unresolvable build path entry in 
the build path property dialog.
The delete action should also update the build path
(notice this was done automatically by the Java Model earlier, but we have 
removed it intentionally).
