Rename a method parameter for a method that is also declared in an interface. 
You get the following message:

Method ... is declared in an interface. Perform this action there.

This makes only sense if I reorder parameters.

Trying to verify: fully qualified names contain '/' instead of '.'

Test Case: Create a class that implements IAdapterFactory

Select getAdapter(...) and try to modify method parameters. In the error 
message I get, the method is called 'java/lang/Object getAdapter
(java/lang/Object adaptableObject, java/lang/Class adapterType)'.

The fully qualified names, especially for classes like Object and Class, make 
it hard to recognize the method. But in any case the '/' should be replaced 
with the usual '.'

Reopen bug?

thanks
