build 20020124

This bug is spawned off of bug 6827 to handle deleting files that are out of 
sync with the file system more gracefully.
Currently, if a file has been changed or deleted outside Eclipse you get 
an "Unexpected exception" dialog and a log file entry is written.
As part of fixing bug 6827 I plan to address out of sync projects and files. 
However, the JDT packages view does not use the platform DeleteResourceAction 
to delete files so it has to address this separately.

Note that JDT does not use the DeleteResourceAction to delete packages either. 
Only projects are covered. Packages and files have to be addressed by JDT.
fixed - 
note that this is a workaround for missing core functionality 
(IResource::isInSynch)


Deleting out of sync file reports "unexpected exception" and writes log
