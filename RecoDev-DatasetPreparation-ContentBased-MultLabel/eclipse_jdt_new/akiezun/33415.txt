We have some custom versions of workbench actions. The workbench actions have 
icons assigned to them, but we don't. This makes the context menu in the 
package explorer inconsistent with the one in the navigator.

The actions are:
cut
copy
paste
refresh
import 
export
delete

refresh icons are not shared (dlcl16/refresh_nav.gif, elcl16/refresh_nav.gif, 
clcl16/refresh_nav.gif)

import icons are not shared (IWorkbenchGraphicConstants.IMG_CTOOL_IMPORT_WIZ 
etc)

export icons are not shared IWorkbenchGraphicConstants.IMG_CTOOL_EXPORT_WIZ
then we should just copy them
