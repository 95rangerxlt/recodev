Tests for CallHierarchyContentProvider

Patches for JDT UI and JDT UI Tests.

Add tests for CallHierarchyContentProvider. Furthermore, they contain
refactorings for the existing test class.
class CallHierarchyTestHelper seems to be missing from the patch

Tests for CallHierarchyContentProvider (again)

Patches against JDT UI and JDT UI Tests. Also two new classes to JDT UI Tests.
released,
great work, Jesper
Adam,

it appears that you forgot to release the changes to the jdt.ui project (two
classes needed to be made public).
something got messed up with my workspace
fixed now
do we need more tests?
I'm not sure. I guess the core parts are pretty well covered by now. Maybe we
should just close this. I'll then add new test cases later on as needed (when
adding new functionality etc.).
ok, closing - you can just attach new stuff here when you have it
