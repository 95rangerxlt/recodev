When moving a CU with d&d that refers to package visible classes/methods 
results in compile errors. The imports are properly added, but since the 
referenced classes is not visible outside of the package the import statement 
doesn't help.

It is not critical, but more support would be nice, we should provide at least 
a warning.

we give warnings in both cases now - if you move a package visible type or if 
you refer to one and move the referencing class 


Move CU refactoring and package visible classes
