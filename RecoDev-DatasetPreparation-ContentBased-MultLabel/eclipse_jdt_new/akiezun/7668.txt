superclass of TextSelectionAction is Action
calling newTypeHierarchy of Action takes roughly 15 seconds (try opening the 
Hierarchy perspective)

1. type hierarchy is cached now which results in x2 speedup on open
and xN (n > 10) speedup on page flip
2. no busy cursor is reported in a separate bug report #7780
3. some progress reporting problems have been fixed

closing - please reopen if the speedup is insufficient 
(taken the 15 seconds i mentioned into account)


Pull up method is extremly slow
