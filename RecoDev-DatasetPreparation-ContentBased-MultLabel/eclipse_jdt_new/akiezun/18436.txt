we delete fields by calling 'delete' in a loop
(unlike other members which we delete all in one go by using text edits)

this results in:
. multiple builds when you have the editor closed
. multiple local history entries

(not sure how to fix though)

can you do it inside a workbench runnable?
defer
The workbench runnable might reduce the numbers of builds to one. Deleting a 
field is done via JDOM (AFAIK) which save the file.

So why don't we use the same code as we use to delete methods ?
Adam, can you test if this still exists. If so we should ask Java Core how to 
avoid this.
it was fixed today


deleting multiple fields triggers multiple builds (if editor closed) [ccp]
