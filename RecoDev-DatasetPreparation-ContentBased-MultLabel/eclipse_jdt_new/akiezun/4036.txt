I've just been trying out the Externalize Strings tool, and find it to be GREAT overall.
Here are a few suggestions for improvement.

Find Strings in package dialog:
- Should show total count across all CUs, i.e. to quickly show that all
strings have or have not been externalized.

- Should allow double-click to open Externalize Strings wizard on selected CU.
  OK to close dialog to do this, or could keep it open.

- Should open 50% wider.


Externalize Strings wizard:
1st page:
- String to externalize table should be taller (can use some of the white space at the bottom),
or shrink Context.

2nd page:
- Should remember settings between invocations, especially for "Create resource bundle accessor class".

3rd page:
- If properties file doesn't exist, get warning saying it will be created, even if it need not be created.
- Wizard page also states that this warning will show up in the workspace, which it doesn't.

4th page:
- Since wizard opens on a single CU, should expand CU by default to show individual changes.

Other suggestions:

The generated Message class is public, but this should not be API.  It should use package visibility instead.

It would be nice if it could figure out from the context that it does not have to NLS the string,
to avoid generating ugly $NON-NLS-1$ tags.
E.g. if it recognizes the pattern Messages.getString("foo"), it should know that "foo" does not need to be externalized.
Another possibility would be to recognize the specified prefix ("MyPrefix.foo").
JDR would like the option to turn off $NON-NLS$ tag generation, or give the user control over how it's tagged (e.g. generate /* do not NLS */).

1. added the counter
2. made the dialog wider
3. made the sash form 50/50
4. create res. bundle field setting remembered
5. the property file is not be created if it does not need to be

20020115, Win2000: The Externalize Strings Wizard Page is too tall. It fills 
the entire height of the screen (at any resolution) and the "next" and "finish" 
buttons are partly hidden by the windows taskbar. Resizing the taskbar 
readjusts the wizard page so that the buttons are visible.
fixed together with bug#8194
