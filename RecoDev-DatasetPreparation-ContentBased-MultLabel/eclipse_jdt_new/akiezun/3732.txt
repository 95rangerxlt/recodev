	This is a missing feature list for the NLS plugin

	1) When using a common prefix, generate a constant for it (public static final String)
	2) wizard should keep settings between calls (I always had to reenter the settings for each file)
	3) need better icons for change/skip/always ignore. The warning/error/info icons make no sense.	
	4) should be allowed to change between change/skip/ignore for multiple items at a time
		(de/select all?).
	5) support for reusing messages/keys.
		NEVER: create a bundle with duplicate keys
	6) check for keys that won't work in resource file (characters ", ', \ ?).
	7) should add import statements when using custom code.

	Also:

	8) selecting a table item on the first page (with keys/value table) is slow. Considering that we're 
		always looking at the same file, I don't see why it should be slow.

EG (7/3/01 5:20:13 PM)
	9) the resource bundle wrapper should have a custom name.
	10) the resource bundle wrapper should have a private constructor so that it can't be instantiated
		be instantiated.

AK (7/3/2001 6:05:50 PM)
	11) the default should be 'skip' not 'translate'

AK (7/3/2001 6:00:44 PM)
	1) not trivial - the constant must be added to all types declared in a cu.
		at least basic name validation must also be done
		suggest using the custom code pattern them - but you'd have to add the field declaraion yourself
	2) easy, i guess
	4) easy
	5) it if does indeed create bundles with duplicated keys tehn it is a bug.
		please file a detailed pr
	6) trivial change once we have the list of illegal characters
	7) easy - however, the import declaration would be custom code as well.
	8) do you mean clicking in the icon? or previewing?
	9) easy.
	10) i thought i put it in there.
			anyway, trivial
	11) trivial

AK (7/4/2001 2:22:21 PM)
	9) fixed
	6) added ? . ' to the list of unwanted characters

EG(7/4/01 1:54:23 PM)
	12) Support to activate cell editor for key by a single click.

EG (7/4/01 2:30:11 PM)
	13) support to create a list resource bundle (not needed for self hosting but for the product)

EG (7/4/01 2:31:09 PM)
	14) make the dialog more verbose:
	- common prefix, explain how it is used: Enter common prefix for a generated keys (optional).
	- add a label above table:
		Strings to be externalized
	- add a label above editor
		Context

EG (7/4/01 2:43:53 PM)
	15) when a string is set to be "Never" translate then remove the key and make the field
	readonly. Currently you can still edit the key.
	Same for skip.

EG (7/4/01 2:46:50 PM)
	16) Should warn for duplicate keys when I enter the key. The error message duplicate key "key"
	is not friendly since then I have to go and manually locate the duplicate

EG (7/4/01 2:48:02 PM)
	17) toggeling the icon is tedious since double click are ignored, double clicking should be
	interpreted as stepping through 2 choices.

EG (7/4/01 2:49:38 PM)
	why is the default skip?

AK (7/4/2001 4:49:47 PM)
	so that the user does not hurt themselves by mistake
	skipping is harmless - translating the wrong stuff may be painful
	i added 4), which will help here too

AK (7/4/2001 5:13:33 PM)
	18) busy cursor on open
	19) make sure that no dup keys are created - even when forcing to proceed

	fixed 2
	fixed 17 double click does exactly what single click()

	1) The import field should be enabled based on the "Create Class" field (i.e. if it is disabled).
	2) If the class is not generated I should either
		- be able to select a class
		- the tool should automatically generate the correct import
	3) I find it more natural to generate the class in the same package as the property file
		==> I would put class and property file into same package as default (higher prio) and offer the
				option to select another package for the class (lower prio)
	4) the value field could be editable when the string is marked as 'translate'

most has been fixed and
imo, this PR has become too much of a dumping ground - closing in favor of:
