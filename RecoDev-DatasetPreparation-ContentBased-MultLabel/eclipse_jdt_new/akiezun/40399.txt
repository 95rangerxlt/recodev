M2 testing

1. In the package explorer select type AssertTest (not the CU)
2. Refactor->Move
3. Select another type (e.g. ClassLoaderTest)
   The error message says: Element inside compilation units can not be used as
targets for files, folders or comp. units

This is a type and should be able to be moved into an enclosing type.

Note that it might be good to have the name/signature of the element currently
koved in the dialog title: E.g. Move 'org.junit.AssertTest'
(or as a description)

Adam, please investigate
workaround is to select the enclosing cu or package (both should do the same)
agreed with Dirk to leave as is for M2
will fix for M3
fixed
