1) set the caret inside a method body
2) perform Refactor>Pull up

You get the error message that you have to select the name of an instance 
method or field.

This is unfriendly, when the selection is inside a method then the refactoring 
can assume that this is the method to be pulled-up. 

It is also inconsistent with the replace with local history, open super 
implementation etc.

every action using SelectionConverter is affected
so maybe it could be handled there
There are several issues here: code resolve doesn't work for inner classes, so 
we don't get a Java element here. If we switch back to the enclosing element 
in this case we might activate refactorings on elements which do not 
correspond to the user's selection. An example is

public class A {
  public void foo() {
    class Local {
      public void g() {
      }
    }
  }
}

If the user selects g() and calls rename, push up, pull down and we consider 
the enclosing method we will perform the action on foo. 

We have several PR in the Javadoc generation world that complain about this.

Erich, do you have a strong opinion here.
The current behaviour is inconsistent with the other source actions. We should 
make the behaviour consistent and accept the limitation on local classes.
agreed to modify the current behavior of:
move static
move instance method
pull up
push down

they will use the enclosing element
other refactorings use the resolved element
fixed
