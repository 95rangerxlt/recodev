The Java Preference Page needs a group box around the two radio buttons at the 
bottom so that assistive technologies can read it. 

There are other issues as well

The use folders option will gray out the text widgets but not thier labels - 
this means it is not clear that they are disabled
 
If General Settings for Java and Type Hierarchy settings are meant to be titles 
the should be in a Group box - they look like information now.

Type Hierarchy settings doesn't need a title for one radio box.

What is the result of deselecting "Action on double clicking on Packages view 
is Go into?". This looks like it should be two radio buttons instead of a 
checkbox.

The label "Action on double clicking on Packages view on container
is 'Go into'" is confusing. Perhaps something like "Action on double-clicking 
on container in Packages view is 'Go Into'" would be better.
Adam pls fix the "go into" blooper. Offer two radio buttons instead

Action on double click:
   [] go into the the selected element
   [] expand the selected element
