all actions, views and dialogs in call hierarchy need help context ids

Added help context ids

Actions and view have had help context ids added. I've added the new constants
at the end of IJavaHelpContextIds. All constants are created with a
CALL_HIERARCHY_ prefix. It doesn't seem to be standard, but since some of my
constants (such as FOCUS_ON_SELECTION_ACTION) logically would have the same
name as existing constants, I decided to prefix. Let me know if I should change
it.
prefixing was a good idea

patch released
thanks
