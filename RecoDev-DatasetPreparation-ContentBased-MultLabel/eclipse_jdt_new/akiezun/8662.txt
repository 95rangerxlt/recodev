reminder

handling of read-only files in refactoring is very much not consistent now.
*all* modified files should be checked for being read-only (also files with 
text matches - if such will be modified)
and the 'pessimistic vcm system problem' must be resolved.

i looked at IWorkbench::validateEdit which is supposed to help us.
however, as it is now it always returns an OK status which is contrary to 
expectations.
i sent a mail to platform-core-dev. if needed a bug report should be file for 
this problem.

we need a story - are read only file modifications (modulo the 
IWorkbench::validateEdit status) an ERROR, a FATALERROR etc.

all refactorings must follow the same policy
