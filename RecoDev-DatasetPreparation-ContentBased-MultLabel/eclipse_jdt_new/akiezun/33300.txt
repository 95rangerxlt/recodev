Although you can see non-Java projects and resources on the Package Explorer 
view, when moving a resource (Refactor->Move), only Java projects are offered 
as options for destination. If I can use this option to move any resource (from 
the user perspective, it looks like the same move action - when working with 
non-Java resources - as offered by the Resource Navigator), I should be able to 
use it to move to any kind of project.

Should investigate whether this can be done for 2.1
i use StandardJavaElementContentProvider
which does not feed the viewer with non java projects

i suggest extending the content provider with a style bit SHOW_NON_JAVA_PROJECT
or in some other way do that i can get non jprojects too
For 2.1 you should subclass the content provider and add non Java handling. 
The standard Java content provider is API and I am reluctent to change it for 
2.1.
