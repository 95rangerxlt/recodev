build 20011114

I had org.eclipse.jdt.ui in my workspace, selected all files and folders in it 
and deleted them.
I got a NullPointerException in 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.refactoring.changes.DeleteFromClasspathChange.toBe
Deleted
All the external JAR references were still in the project after the exception 
occured. When I try to delete those I get the same walkback.
I'll upload my workspace to walleye.

Created attachment 123
.log file with walkback
The workspace is in INCOMING/forKnut/6016.zip
I think the problem was that I was trying to *delete* the external JAR 
references instead of removing them in the project properties.
The question is whether this is a legal operation. I think it should be and it 
should be the same as removing the JARs in the project properties. Of course I 
shouldn't get an exception in either case.
the problem came from the call to JavaCore.getResolvedClasspathEntry
which returns null sometimes.
code has to take that possibility into account.
it does now.
