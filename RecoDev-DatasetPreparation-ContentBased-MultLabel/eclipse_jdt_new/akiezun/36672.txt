Fix for showing a progress bar

Patch against JDT UI.

This patch shows a progress bar when searching for callers/callees.

Compared to earlier (the initial contribution), I'm no longer using UNKNOWN.
Also, I've improved the Cancel-awareness.

ProgressMonitors are not my strongest point. I'd like you to take a look and
see if it can be improved (it most likely can, and I guess that you'll do that
anyway... :-) ).
what i saw looks ok (it's coded in a not-very-standard-pm way but that's no big 
deal) - most importantly, now we have the progress bar and we can improve it as 
we go

one place where it could be improved (but i realize it's not trivial) is 
searching for callees. but, on the other hand, it never takes long enough for 
me to actually be able to see it let alone cancel it :)

cheers
