When the class file viewer is used to open a non-class file (e.g., an HMTL 
file) I get an error message "Invalid resource type for Invalid input for Class 
File Viewer". 
You should decide whether it's an invalid resource type or simply invalid input.

Adam, pls find the corresponding code.
pls check with Kai before releasing.
it's because we call
new JavaModelStatus(IJavaModelStatusConstants.INVALID_RESOURCE_TYPE, "Invalid 
input for Class File Viewer")

which gets combined to the message you see.
fix is to call:
new JavaModelStatus(IJavaModelStatusConstants.INVALID_RESOURCE_TYPE, "Class 
File Viewer")

which will display as "Invalid resource type for Class File Viewer"



got the official blessing for fixing the unfortunate string in the properties
