See pictures I'll attach afterwards.

1. I navigated to the bottom of the list
2. Checked "measureBlackLevel()"
3. The list navigated to top

I expected "3.jpg" instead of "2.jpg".

Can't reproduce for using I20030211. I tested the following

- TestCase.java from JUnit
- selected fName
- opened Pull up
- scrolled to the bottom and checked setName . 

Can you provide a standalone test case if you still see this behaviour in 
I20030211.

More information: 

- I'm currently running M5(I had lots of problems downloading M5, and I'm a bit 
hesitant to download the daily build just now).
- I tried this a second time on M5, and it no longer happens.

I should have searched for exceptions in the log, but I forgot at the time.

Attaching a copy of the log in the hope that inspection of the log can point to 
something.

Reproduceable case

Reproduces problem

1. Add files to a project
2. In package explorer, select F1.waitForMore method.
3. Refactor-> pull up
4. Scroll to top in the "Specify actions for members"
5. Select CONTRAST

It now scrolls to the bottom, as reported
small test case:
package p;

public class A {
}
class B extends A{
	private static final int A = 0;
	private static final int A1 = 0;
	private static final int A2 = 0;
	private static final int A3 = 0;
	private static final int A4 = 0;

	public void f(){}
	public void f1(){}
	public void f12(){}
	public void f123(){}
	public void f1234(){}
	public void f12345(){}
	public void f123456(){}
	public void f1234567(){}	
}

select f1234567
pull up
scroll, select A
for some strange reason the viewer scrolls on refresh
i put code to stop it from doing it
