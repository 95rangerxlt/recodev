Build 20035020

class A {
  protected void foo(Object o);
  protected void foo(String s);
}

- selected foo(Object o) and change its visibility to public using change 
  method signature. 

Observe: in subclasses all methods with the signature foo(String s) are 
changed as well.

Case two:

class A {
  foo(B b);
}

class D extends A {
  foo(String s)
}

- rename foo(String s) in D.

Observe: you get a warning dialog that you should rename A::foo(B b).
