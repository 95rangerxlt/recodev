Modify parameters of a method would be more usefull if it was more like "Change signature" in e.g. 
Idea.

Modify parameters only allows one to rename and/or reorder the 
parameters.
Features such as adding, removing, changing types of parameters and chainging 
return type would be great!

Just an idea :)
