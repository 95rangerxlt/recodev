It would be nice if there were a refactor option to extract the public methods 
of my class and turn them into an interface.  The operation should allow me to 
select which methods to extract, it should change my class to implement the new 
interface, and optionally replace references to my class with references to the 
new interface.

This would be useful in situations where I've created an abstract superclass, 
but decide later that it might make more sense for the class to be an 
interface.  Examples of this pattern in Eclipse include Action/IAction and 
Container/IContainer.

we would like to have this one as well, but we can't commit it for 2.0
