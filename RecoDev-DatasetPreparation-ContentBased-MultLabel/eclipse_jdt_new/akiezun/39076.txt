Tests failed after a update of the ASTRewriter.
The ordering of the fields seems to be wrong.
I think the ASTRewrite does the correct job, can you have a look at it.
Note that the placehoders have now a more specific type. So if you were using
the placeholders node type (method, field, initializer...)
