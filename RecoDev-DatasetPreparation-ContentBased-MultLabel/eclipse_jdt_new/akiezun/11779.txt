  Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V worked at the beginning, after some time they stopped working.

linux-motif:
  Ctrl-C works, Ctrl-V does not.

  Ctrl-Insert, Shift-Insert don't work.

i simply register the actions using: 
IActionBars::setGlobalActionHandler(IWorkbenchActionConstants.COPY, IAction)
IActionBars::setGlobalActionHandler(IWorkbenchActionConstants.PASTE, IAction)
IActionBars::setGlobalActionHandler(IWorkbenchActionConstants.CUT, IAction)

(see org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.reorg.ReorgGroup)

Please supply a repeatable test case. Note, if you are using Linux, check to see
if the numlock light is on. Accelerators are not processed in this mode - SWT
has a defect report for this already. 
It is not the num lock. See above: Ctrl-c works but Ctrl-v does not.
pls try to come up with a repeatable test case.
w2k 20020328.1:

  1) Select a package, Ctrl-c
  2) Select parent project, Ctrl-v
  3) Verify that the copyof.<package> was created
  4) Select another package, Ctrl-c
  5) Leave the same package selected, Ctrl-v
  6) Observe that nothing happens
  7) Select parent project, Ctrl-v
  8) Observe that nothing happens,
     it's as if Ctrl-v does not work anymore
i'll have a look
it has sth to do with the actions not being selection change listeners
the test case provided works now
Ctrl-Insert, Shift-Insert i have no control over
