after bug 36514 is fixed, only the depth will remain on the pref page


it's a 1-view setting so it should be settable on the view

- maybe an entry in the drodown 'menu'


- or a field in the 'filters' dialog)

bug #36520.
This bug can now be marked as resolved since the preference page has been
removed due to the fix to bug #36514.
fixed
