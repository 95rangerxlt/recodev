Select a method in the Members pane on a class that is /not/ being edited. Open 
the context menu and the "Delete" operation is disabled.

Workaround: Double click the method which opens it in an editor, /then/ you can 
open the context menu and choose "Delete".

IMHO, I should not be forced to perform this extra step.

Making the Delete op work as I suggest means recompiling the class the method 
used to belong to of course.
This is a regression, the old behaviour was to prompt the user whether the 
method should be deleted.

This could be a consequence of the getResource semantic change. Adam pls 
investigate.
getResource()-related it sure is
fixed


Editor on method must be opened in order to delete it from the Members context menu. [refactoring]



fix for 26231
