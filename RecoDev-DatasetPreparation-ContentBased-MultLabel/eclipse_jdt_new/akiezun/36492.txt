Fix for recursion indication

Patch against JDT UI. Also see the next attachment containing new icons.

This patch contains a patch for indicating recursion with an icon decoration.
The separate "- Recursion -" node is no longer shown.

I've also removed the "Max call depth" node and replaced with its own icon
decoration.

The icons are also decorated with little arrows indicating the call direction
(see bug #36494).

The label provider has been changed to subclass the
AppearanceAwareLabelProvider to allow for preference settings regarding package
names, method return types etc. I've removed the label format actions from the
view menu - they were very unlike what's seen elsewhere in the UI.

New icons

New JDT UI icons related to the above attachment. Should go into the ovr16
directory.
hmm, it does not want to compile for me because
CallHierarchyLabelProvider has references to fJavaElementLabelProvider, which 
cannot be resolved after the field is deleted

btw, what do you use to create these patch files? they contain all information 
twice (evry change in every file is listed 2 times)

New version of previous patch

The reference to fJavaElementLabelProvider should have been removed by the
patch. Maybe I can pursuade you to try again with this patch (it's the same but
only half the size). I guess Mozilla has been playing games with me.

Same fix again (this time zipped)

Zipped the patch. It this a known problem in Bugzilla that it corrupts the
patches (I guess not...)?
Created attachment 4684
Recreated fix

Something had gone completely wrong with the patch. I've recreated it (I
hope...).
fix released - it looks great
