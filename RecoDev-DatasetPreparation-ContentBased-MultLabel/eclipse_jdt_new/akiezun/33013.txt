Build 2.1 RC1

0. Set preference to use 'f' prefix for fields
1. Add non-static type T to a top-level type
2. Save
3. Select T
4. Refactor -> Convert nested type to Top Level...
==> a dialog comes up and asked for the field name

Observe: the proposed name is not prefixed with an 'f'.
We can argue that this is not the name of the field but then the generated code
should at least contain the 'f' prefix.
