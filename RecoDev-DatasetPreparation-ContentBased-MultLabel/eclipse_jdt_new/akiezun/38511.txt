1. call hierarchy view as fast view, detail pane showing
2. display the call hierarchy for some method
3. select a caller - detail pane shows calling lines
4. go back to the editor
5. select another method and invoke call hierarchy
6. the fast view opens with the top pane cleared, but the detail pane still 
shows the previous content.

-> the detail pane should be flushed if the main pane is.

Fix for clearing the location subview

Patch against CallHierarchyViewPart.

Updates the location subview before refreshing the call hierarchy tree viewer.
released, thanks
there's still a minor glitch:
- when i run 'refresh' it flushes the location view but the hierarchy view is 
not flushed and only refreshed when searching is done
