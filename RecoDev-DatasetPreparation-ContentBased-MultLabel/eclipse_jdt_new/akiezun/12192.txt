Build: 20020321

Description:
I have two methods that are supposed to have the same name:

public Word computeSuccessorTo(Word word)
public Word computerSuccessorTo(ILetterNode letterNode)

I noticed that I had misspelt the name of the second method (there shouldn't be 
an r after compute) so I tried to use the rename function in the refactor 
menu.  It complained that my class already had a method named 
computeSuccessorTo with the same number of parameters.  The complaint is 
correct, but it isn't a problem since the arguments are of different types.

If I ignore the errors and press Finish, the results are correct.

fix to be considered after 2.0
to be investigated
changed to issue only a warning if the type names are different. if they're the 
same, an error will still be issued.
full checking if semantic of the program changes due to overloading after 
rename etc. is not planned at this point.
