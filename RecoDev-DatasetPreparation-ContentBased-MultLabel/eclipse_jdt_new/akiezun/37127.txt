Interface methods that are automatically generated, such as by the "Extract

see bug 32990 for the opposite oppinion
see bug 34961 for the same oppinion as yours

so, if you don't oppose i'll treat this report as a feature request for an 
additional checkbox in the dialog

preference under code generation. May be more refactorings should follow the 
style.
I agree, this should be a feature request either in the dialog itself or in code
generation.
