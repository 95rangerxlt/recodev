The following refactoring does not work: reorder parameters of constructors. 
This works for non-constructor methods but fails for constructors. A simple 
(double, double) will demonstrate the flaw. The constructor itself is changed 
but none of the constructor references are updated.

too late to fix for M1 - i will disable the action for constructors.
will fix after M1.

reducing severity - it's disabled not so nobody will get hurt
blovked by a jcore bug
fixed.
since you can now add and remove params
one missing special case is than no-arg construcotrs can have implicit 
references
class A{
 A(){}
}
class B(){
 B(){} //<<reference to A()
}

adding a parameter to A() must result in
class A{
 A(int i){}
}
class B(){
 B(){
   super(0); //<<newly inserted code
 }
}


before this is implemented i disable this operation on non-arg construcotrs
add yourself to bug 24713 if you wish to be notified when it gets fixed


Reorder parameter refactoring of constructors broken [refactoring]



disable for construcotrs - broken. see bug 23585
