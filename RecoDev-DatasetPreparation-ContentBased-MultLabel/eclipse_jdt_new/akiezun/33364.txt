rc1
1. Select a static field, choose Move...
2. Browse for a type name, remove one character so it cannot be found
3. The error message dialog is almost impossible to fit to the dialog, so it
shortened using '...'. It contains the fully qualified type name + a extra
sentence that the name must be fully qualified.
I suggest to do it as:
'Destination type does not exist.' or  'Destination type not found.'
If you want to add that the name must be fully qualified I would add this to the
label: Destination type (fully qualified) (and put this label on a line above
the text box, as the text bix is too small anyway)

serious: error messages have to be readable
Another things is that we should try to make the message line in the new 
refactoring dialog two lines high. See bug 33426. Nevertheless the error 
message should be change so that the most important information is at the 
beginning.
