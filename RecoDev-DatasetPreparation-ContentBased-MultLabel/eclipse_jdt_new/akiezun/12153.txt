I wanted to copy a class to the same package and then rename it.
(Because the new class I am creating is quite similar to the old).
I happened to be in the Java Browsing perspective.
I selected the old class, and said Copy.
Then I selected the package and tried to paste, but it was disabled.
So I tried pasting into the 'class list', and I got text pasted into the editor.
It was a very strange behavior, and not expected.

will be covered by the M5 work item: Moving, copying top-level type should 
move, copy Compilation Unit

copy fixed 
Copy wasn't broken - paste was broken.
Do you mean "paste fixed"?
yes, i meant 'copy' as opposed to 'move'
and you mean 'copy' as opposed to 'paste'

so my 'copy' and your 'paste' are the same thing
<g>
<grin> Ah yes - that other 'copy'. Thanks.
btw, move is now fixed too (in the java perspective package view works with 
d'n'd as well)
Cool...


Copy/Paste doesn't work as expected in Java Browsing prespective
