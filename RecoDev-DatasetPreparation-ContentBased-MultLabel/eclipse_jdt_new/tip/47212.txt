- setup a development workspace having JDT/UI in source
- open Refactoring class. 
- change return type of method checkActivation

The problem is that when the computation of the valid types causes an 
exception you still try access the valid types these might be null. In both 
cases, the error and the user interruption, the viewer shouldn't be refreshed, 
a message should be presented and the all buttons except the cancel button 
should be disabled.
