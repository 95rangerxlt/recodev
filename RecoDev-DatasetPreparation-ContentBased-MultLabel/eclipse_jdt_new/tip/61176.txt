- run change method signature on the return type of foo:

public void virtualMethod() {
  class Local {
    String foo() {
      return null;
    }
  }
}

The dialog that comes up tells !ChangeTypeAction.exception!. First there seems 
to be an NLS error. The String isn't NLS correctly. Second, this isn't an 
exception. The dialog should say something like: The operation isn't supported 
inside local types.

Sorry, run change type ...
I tried this with M8, and I don't get the error. Strange. I will
download I20040505 tomorrow when I'm connected at work and see
if the error shows up.

I think this is caused by the fix we put in that checks if the binding is null.
Nice "fix" :-)  I can reproduce the problem now and am working on
a fix for the fix.

fix for bad message in popup

GT refactoring was referring to the wrong entry in the properties file.
Hi Dirk,

I had trouble checking out the latest JDT UI from HEAD. This patch was 
created against the 0504 version. Let me know if this is problematic.

The change is just one line.

regards,

  -Frank



Frank, 

something I don't fully understand is that the String return type of foo that 
I want to generalize isn't a local type.

	public void virtualMethod() {
		class Local {
			String foo() {
				return null;
			}
		}
	}

Why is generalize type disallowed here? The String type isn't a local type it 
is simply used inside of a local type. If this doesn't work either we have to 
use a separate error message: "Generalize type not support inside local types".

patch with  better error message in popup
Hi Dirk,

I just submitted a new patch with a better error message in the popup.
For the following program:

public class C {
	public void virtualMethod() {
		  class Local {
		    String foo(String x) {
		      return null;
		    }
		    String y;
		  }
		  Local z = new Local();
		}
}

selecting: (i) the return type of foo(), (ii) parameter x, and (iii) field y
will produce the message "GT is currently not supported inside local types".
Selecting the declaration of z will produce the same message as before, namely
"GT is currently not supported on local types".

regards,

  -Frank

Released fix to HEAD.


Need better dialog when change type isn't supported
