Dirk,

When I open class String, and I right-click anywhere in the editor,
I don't have a "Refactor" menu. So, I don't even know how to start
the Change Type refactoring. Can you please tell me exactly how
you encountered this bug?

You have to select the toString method in the outliner. 
Fixed in latest version.


Change Type for a binary method creates NPE
