1. create a selfhosting eclipse workspace that has all plugins as binary except 
jdt.core from HEAD.
2. use 'Generalize Type' on various parameters and also cancel some of these.
(see other bug reports)

The Eclipse memory consumption goes over 500MB.

Seems to be related to the high memory consumption in general.
I looked into it using yourkit memory profiler and we don't leak (at least the 
profiler didn't report one). But we still consume "some" memory. Frank, can 
you please do some further investigations here for M7.
Closing. As said a memeory profiler doesn't report leaks and Frank imroved the 
memory consumption of the type constraint engine.
See bug 50676 for the memory consumption improvements.
