The generalize type refactoring should be enabled both for declarations

I see the following issues:

a.) List<String> list= null. Activating generalize type on list suggests
    Collection<E>... which is wrong. Selecting it imports collection but
    doesn't rewrite the code.

b.) 	public <T> void baz() {
		List<T> list= null;
	}

    Suggesting Collection<E> is correct, but the rewriting doesn't work.

Frank, we should try to address this for M4. We want to be done with the 
generics support with M4.
Frank, as discussed please have a look for M5.
I have fixes for both of these problems now. Patch will follow soon.
