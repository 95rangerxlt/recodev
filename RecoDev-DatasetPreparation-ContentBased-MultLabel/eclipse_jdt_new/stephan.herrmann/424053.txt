With bug 400874 about to be closed this bug will server as the umbrella for remaining & new issues relating to type inference in 1.8.
Starting to take stock on regressions caused by switching to the new type inference:

ComplianceDiagnoseTest.test401850()
- Likely caused, by deciding too early that the tentative inference result X<Object> is actually the final outcome, hence selecting a non optimal solution. Need to revisit how resolve of diamond can avoid persistent side effects.

OverloadResolutionTest8.test032()
- we no longer see that both methods are applicable... inference starts with X#RAW, finds the second method, then infers the diamond to Object and sees that foo is not ambiguous
Regression in GenericRegressionTest.test366131b() could be traced back to poor readableName() / shortReadableName() of CaptureBinding18 in combination with non-deterministic order in its upperBounds array.

Both is fixed via commit dd2d999bb92f1e106218a30e477eebe8f58b2e19.
The following tests fail due to sub-optimal error message and have been disabled:
- GenericsRegressionTest.test375394()
- JavadocTest_1_5.testBug82514()

I've also disabled the tests mentioned in comment 1.

At this point the test suites show regressions only in GenericTypeTest (37+/-1)
The intermittent failures in GenericTypeTest.{test0470,test0627} could be fixed in a way similar to comment 2.

Pushed as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=9506194ecd38aa227915d4452e8097fba7bd6231
The implementation contains a hack to allow unchecked conversions, where the spec doesn't allow it. This is done in order to mimic the acknowledged javac bug https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8026527 which deliberately will not be fixed for Java 8.

The hack is controlled by the flag InferenceContext18.SIMULATE_BUG_JDK_8026527.

Unfortunately, this hack makes ecj accept *more* illegal programs than javac.

My question on the EG list resulted in the advice in http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-spec-experts/2013-December/000447.html

I've implemented this advice, which means to propagate an "isSoft" flag through all of the inference. This behavior is controlled by another flag: InferenceContext18.ARGUMENT_CONSTRAINTS_ARE_SOFT

This change fixed the following tests (i.e., spec'd errors are now again raised correctly - in accordance with javac):
- GenericTypeTest.test1010
- GenericTypeTest.test1017
- GenericTypeTest.test1157

This caused intermediate regression in test0999 & test1000, which, however, could be identified as a bug in ConstraintTypeFormula.reduce() regarding the detection of array of raw type. Fixed.


Down to 33 regressions in GenericTypeTest.

> Down to 33 regressions in GenericTypeTest.

Most of these only relate to how we report a correctly detected error.

Only three tests deviate:

test1146() 
 - we were expecting too many errors, fixed (and validated against javac).

test1281()
 - TODO: I still need to apply the workaround recommended in http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-spec-experts/2013-December/000444.html

test1051()
 - TODO: we should probably issue more warnings


Fix for test1146 is in http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=98d48348a9326f13ae94038169b2804277852fd1


=== I'll leave at this for now with this balance: ===

Failures in GenericTypeTest:
- 30 sub-optimal error messages (marked ERRMSG)
- 2 TODOs (test1281, test1051)
Disabled tests in other suites (see above):
- GenericsRegressionTest.test375394()  (ERRMSG)
- JavadocTest_1_5.testBug82514()       (ERRMSG)
- ComplianceDiagnoseTest.test401850()
- OverloadResolutionTest8.test032()

Another interesting example is in bug 424198 comment 1

Different compiler versions show different combinations of errors, and it's not directly obvious if any of the compilers answers correctly ;-P
Through commit http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=df58102577aeec0f20c498bd98bb398edac7a1ec I disabled 32 tests
in GTT for 1.8 mode. These can be looked at in due course.

Disabled test list:

test0538
test0142
test0150
test0151
test0168
test1008
test1015
test1034
test0607
test0631
test0684
test0685
test0742
test0785
test0787
test0790
test0798
test0827
test0883
test1076
test1148
test1207
test1209
test1210
test1281
test1291
test1292
test1322
test1323
test1326
test1363
test1429
GTT.test1429 fails even in 1.7 mode - thanks for looking into this to see if
this indicative of some interference between the two inference schemes.

Oops, my test adjustment in http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=98d48348a9326f13ae94038169b2804277852fd1 should have affected 1.8+ modes, only.

Fixed via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=74a3b98be7e8e7ea98628bddc70a14abe6965022
Via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=f98c9e376d07d0e65cfd307c772db2eeb92af6b9 I've released some corrections for the resolution phase: computation of variable dependency was incorrect and we failed to select the smallest possible set of dependent variables.

By fixing this, bug 425031 became relevant, though. (No other existing tests seem to be affected).
After closing 423505 I declare the type inference implementation feature-complete. Remaining issues are essentially considered as "polish items", and will be managed via bug 427059.
