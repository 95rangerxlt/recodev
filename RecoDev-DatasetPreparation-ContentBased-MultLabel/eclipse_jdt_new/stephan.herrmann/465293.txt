Extracted from bug 462412:

Currently, classpath containers only allow editing of an annotationpath per contained element/jar.

When configuring a project's build path (as opposed to JRE preferences) it should be possible to define a single annotation path for an entire classpath container.

Just a reminder that M7 (May 1) is feature freeze. No feature work after that.

Thanks.
That's why I extracted this (tiny) change from the bigger bug 462412.

One thing I couldn't find in any current plan: what's the deadline for new externalized strings? I'm recalling s.t. like M6?
(That's why I also deferred addition of a simple new message dialog as feedback to users - see bug 462412 comment 6).
