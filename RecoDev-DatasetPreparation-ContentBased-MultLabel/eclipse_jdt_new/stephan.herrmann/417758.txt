Yea, arrays are a pain, because we don't have a constructor that can enforce non-null elements.
The inline array initializer must be checked, that's for sure.

Much more typical, however, will be situations where an array is created with a weaker type and only later casted to a type with non-null elements. We might consider providing a library function to perform this cast in a checked manner:

  <T> @NonNull T[] toNonNullElements(T[] in) throws NullPointerException {...}

Would it make sense to place such a function into the annotations bundle
or should that bundle remain strictly annotations-only?

Another option would be to consider
  @LazyNonNull C[]
as the typical/recommended declaration for arrays that are filled dynamically.

The change looks bigger than it is: I simply pulled up a snippet from ReturnStatement into Statement, where it can be called from ArrayInitializer (which so far had no null checking at all).

The change in ArrayAllocationExpression ensures that type annotations are resolved before the expected type is passed into the ArrayInitializer.
