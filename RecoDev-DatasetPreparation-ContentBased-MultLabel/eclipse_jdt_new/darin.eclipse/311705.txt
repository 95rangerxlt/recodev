It used to belong to JDT/UI, but now it's in Core/Resources. Added to bug 311704.
I updated the versions on two of the bundles and retagged all but org.eclipse.core.externaltools.  I don't have commit rights there, so I'm assigning the bug to Darin so he can tag them (the version does not need to change as the bundle was created in 3.6).
Done.


please tag these debug bundles so they include source references for the 3.6 release
