Build Identifier: 3.6.0 I20100608-0911

I defined an external program as a builder. The external builder called java and the OpenJPA JPA enhancer. The enhancer works from the JVM classpath. However their is no variable defined that would allow you to pass the project classpath into the java -cp argument. You have to enter it again.

It would be really good if there was a variable like ${project_classpath} perhaps that can take an argument, so you could do this ${project_classpath:${project_name}} and have it expand to the classpath

Reproducible: Always

patch

Adds a ${project_classpath:name} variable, resolver, and a UI for configuring/selecting a Java project. Added tests as well.
Fixed.
ProjectClasspathArugumentSelector and its message strings have a typo (Ar*u*gument).

Is there a special reason why ${project_classpath} without arguments is not supported? I would expect this variable to work like ${project_name}. This would avoid clumsy constructs like ${project_classpath:${project_name}}.

Thanks Markus - I fixed up the typo. Added support for selected project when no argument is specified.

Final missing piece is the description of the variable.
Thanks, Markus. Applied.
