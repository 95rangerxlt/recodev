Shouldn't that be

/*/target/

in analogy to

/*/bin/

?
It's the same as the other bug, or am I missing anything?

Feel free to answer comment 2 either here or there :)

Sorry I should have been more explicit. I had intended for this one to be against this repo [1] because I could not find it on Gerrit. The one in bug 414238 is against the jdt.core repo.
