The test data has to be unzipped and the containing 3 zip files are to be placed in org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests\testresources folder before executing the testcases.
Thanks for the patch Manju. Some comments after review:

- the tests are hard to read because most of their source are creating
  the test expected result. Please also add the expected result (file) as test
  resource.

- the copyright is missing

- we must not use 'com.ibm' or 'ibm' in the test resources (use 
  'org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests')

- test resource also need a proper copyright

- use readable names: "133534" is meaningless, especially since it is not
  used in a test name (e.g. testForBug133534 or mentioned in Javadoc)

- use plural for the test suite name ==> PackageJavadocTests

- I would put all test resource (in and out) into a new sub-folder:
  /org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests/testresources/PackageJavadocTests

- test packages are usually marked as internal in the manifest since they
  are not considered API. The Quick Fix does not do this for us because
  the package name does not have ".internal." in it

  resource.
  
  Since we are comparing the resolved content of the Javadoc, we cannot put the expected result in a text file as the resolved path varies from machine to machine. Hence i have extracted methods from the common content of the expected result. Now the tests are almost readable.

- Added copyrights to all the Java resources, including the test resources.

- renamed the test resources to 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests'

- renamed test method to testForBug397455_NPEOnReferenceLinks and added Javadoc

- Renamed the testsuite to PackageJavadocTests

- testcases have been modified to read the testdata from 
  /org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests/testresources/PackageJavadocTests

- marked the package 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.packageHover' as internal in the manifest file.

The test 'testForBug397455_NPEOnReferenceLinks' will fail as the bug 397455 is waiting to be reviewed.

We should only test that the feature itself works i.e. only check that some basic text is served from the APIs. Otherwise we will always get failures due to small difference, e.g. all your tests fail on my machine because I use different fonts.

No, you did not. Please check the patch again.

Good, but please put the full directory structure into the test data ZIP, so that one can simply extract it to the root of the test bundle.

This one still fails, even if I adjust the font on my machine.

This is also not fixed. Please use a more meaningful name.

Updated Patch

Thanks for the review comments Dani. Please find the updated patch with the following updates.

- Testcases now checks the presence of part of the expected Javadoc rather than the complete Javadoc content.
- Removed all references to "ibm" in the test resources. Cross checked by searching all 3 zip contents.
- Testdata is now put in testresources folder, so that it can be directly unzipped in to "org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests" bundle.
- renamed 'testForBug397455_NPEOnReferenceLinks' to 'testPackageInfoWithReferenceLinks()'
- added a testcase to check error message when there is no package Javadoc.
>- use readable names: "133534" is meaningless, especially since it is not

This was still not fixed. I've now fixed it myself to avoid another ping pong. Also note that we do not use the @author tag. I've remove that from the class comment and added the missing @since tag.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=d79155d1054134764d5883aa594c7cd7c1884ef1
Thanks Dani. 

The review comment 
">- use readable names: "133534" is meaningless, especially since it is not
>  used in a test name (e.g. testForBug133534 or mentioned in Javadoc)"

was totally misinterpreted. I was assuming it in the context of one of the testcase name which initially was test133534, So in my patches i modified the name of the testcase and also added some Javadoc to it. It did not cross my mind that the review comment was concerning the test data itself.

Will be more careful with the review comments in future.

Fix for the failing test case in the nightly build.

The test case "testGetPackageAttacheddoc" require net connection to download the attached Javadoc, since the machine where the nightly build runs was not equipped with net connection, this test case failed. The test case is now modified to check if the net connection is available and proceed accordingly.
