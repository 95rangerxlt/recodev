Use JavaModelUtil.isPackageInfo(ICompilationUnit) util where applicable.


This should only be done when the Package hover work is in 'master'.

Proposed Fix.

JavadocView is modified to use the util method.

Did not make changes in ImportReferencesCollector as the code after refactoring looked complicated than before the change.
Thanks for the patch.

We could consider to change #isPackageInfo(ICompilationUnit) to #isPackageInfo(ITypeRoot) and then change the implementation that it works for IClassFile too, but that seems overkill at this point.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=52ff99eb9b2828612fe521d9d8c881b170bf8b02
