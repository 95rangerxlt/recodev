As discussed the other day: The configuration of save participants using the clean up profile is not optimal. I would like to present checkboxes like 'Format' and 'Organize Import' directly on the page as these are most common.

Suggestion:
On save, perform the following operations:
  x Clean Up:
      'Profile-Combo' 'Edit...' <a>Configure Clean Up profiles</a>
  x Format
  x Organize Import

If clean up is checked, format and organize import ar grayed-out (disabled) and the checked state represents the value as configured in the profile.

Alternative 2:
  o custom operations:
     x format
     x organize imports
  o clean up:
     profile combo

I also suggest to rename the preference page: 'Save participants' is a very technical term. Better 'On Editor Save' or 'Save Operations', maybe 'Save Actions'

+1 to change the name for now

-1 for first alternative. The second one looks better and here's another alternative:

  clean up: <profile combo>
     x format
     x organize imports

where we add 'Do not use profile' to the profile drop down.
- if a real profile is selected then the items below are disabled and give a preview of what's inside the profile.
- if 'Do not use profile' is selected then the items below are enabled

+1 for alternative 2

So you select the do not use profile profile?!? Very strange...

Another alternative would be to have more built in profiles:
 - 'Organize Imports' profile
 - 'Format' profile
 - 'Organize Imports and Format' profile

I don't like these dummy profiles. They would again show up in a combo and you have to first open the combo to see all the alternatives. And when we add another option we're in troble and we'll end up with lots of combinations.
'Clean Up: Do not use profile' is really strange. Why not adding a checkbox before and we're very close to suggestion 1.

I think we should go for the suggestion 1. Why do you think it isn't good?
Because it's confusing to have the same operations inside clean up. Code is needed to not run them twice etc. Definitely -1 for this. I can live with a alternative 2  - I suggest to explore how that feels.
That's why the 'format' and 'organize import' check boxes are grayed out when 'Clean Up' is checked. They are grayed but checked/unchecked depending if the profile has format/org-imp enabled. I think there is no confusion here.

That's just bad UI. Either use radio or check boxes but not check boxes that act like radio button.

Yes, 100% agree. If you want radio button behavior then use radio buttons.
