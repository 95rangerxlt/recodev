Please provide steps. 

The dialog filters out all sets for which the following is true:
!set.isSelfUpdating() || set.isAggregateWorkingSet()

As far as I understand the doc isEditable is true if an IWorkingSetPage has been contributed for the working set type, which I don't care about because I don't use this page...
Oops, I just saw a few workings sets called 'Aggregate for window 43921371', and I assumed they were aggregate working sets. But it looks like they are normal resource working sets that remained in my workspace due to some bugs.

An additional check for isEditable() would IMO not hurt, since we should not allow editing working sets through the Package Explorer if they are not editable in a dialog.

Furthermore, I would move !set.isSelfUpdating() after set.isAggregateWorkingSet(), since the former iterates over all elements for aggregate working sets.
Agreed.
