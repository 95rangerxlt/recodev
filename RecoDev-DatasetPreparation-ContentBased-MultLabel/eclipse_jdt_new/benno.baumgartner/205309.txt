The Save error dialog that comes up when clean up on save fails has wrong wording: it says that save failed which is wrong. It should better explain what happened, especially whether all participants will be reverted or just this change being ignored. E.g. if I have participant1..10 and participant 5 fails I want to know which ones succeeded.
