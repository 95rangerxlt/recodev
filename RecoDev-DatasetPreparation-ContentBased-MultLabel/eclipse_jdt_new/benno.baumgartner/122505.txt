Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20051220-0800

Create project with inclusion and exclusion patters disabled and no seperate
src and output folder.
On build path menu select 'New Source Folder'
The wizard shows the error:
 Cannot nest 'P03/src' inside 'P03'. To enable the nesting exclude 'src/' from 'P03'
But the check box is disabled (which is correct). The error should say something else.

Just having the check box disabled without informing the user why is very bad. I will enable the check box even though selecting it will not solve the issue. But at least if the user does select the check box he will be informed why it does not work that way: "Inclusion or exclusion patterns are disabled in project Foo, cannot selectively include or exclude from entry: ''"

But the error message is confusing. The error message comes from core. File bug 122615 against core.

released enabled check box > 20060103
Forgot to tag it as fixed back then
