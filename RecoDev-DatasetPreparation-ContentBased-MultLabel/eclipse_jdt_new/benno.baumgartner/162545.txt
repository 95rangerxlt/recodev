Save Participants preference page not updated when clean up profile added:
- Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Participants
- click link 'Clean Up'
- create new profile
- click 'Back' button
-> new profile not available in combo
But it is available, if you press apply on the Clean Up Preference page before you click back. Isn't it? Mmm, I guess this is not the behavior you've expected then?
I guess we already had a similar problem of interdependent preference pages with the Java Build Path properties page and the Java Compiler properties page. There, I now get a dialog when I change something on the build path page and then leave the page.

Maybe we need something similar here (not urgent for M3).

Fixed together with bug 162542 . The Clean Up preference page is in sync with the Save Participant preference page, meaning that a change on one page should be reflected on the other page without pressing apply.
