See in attach patch with first version of code style transformations.
Currently it supports only "{}" and "()" changes: keep, add, remove.
  Preferences implementation (and may be also rest of code :-)) is awful, I
don't have much experience with so flexible preference pages.

Patch with code style transformations
Martin, I am not sure whether this is quick fix or editor functionality.
Patch is partial implementation of this idea:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85401#c4
not for 3.1
reopen
Benno, as an inspiration only, maybe you can use part of the patches, but that's
not important.

Konstantin, we are working on a 'beautifier' action, that would work on multiple
files to do semantic formattings.
As I can see, this request was marked as "clean Up". Does this means that such
code style transformation will be accessible only using "Clean Up" wizard? I
would like to have separate action for fast applying all (configured) "clean up"
changes for current compilation unit.
You can apply all configured clean ups on the visible cu in an editor by
pressing Alt-Shift-S, U, Finish. I think this is pretty fast.

Separate plugin for style changes

I upload this plugin as temporary solution for users that need such code
transformations and we all wait better solution from Benno. :-)
To comment 9 - thank you, the plugin is *very* useful. I can't count how much 
times I have missed such feature in Eclipse. Btw, the key sequence is "Ctrl-
Shift-Y" and not "Alt-Shift-S, U" as in comment 8 - was it intentional?
Alt-Shift-S, U is "Clean up" wizard invocation. My plugin was implemented for
late milestone of 3.1, so there was no "Clean up". Plus I need easy shortcut, as
Ctrl-Shift-F for "Format" or Ctrl-Shift-O for "Organize imports".
To #8:
No, it is not fast. In fact, It is slow. Compare it to Ctrl+Shift+O or
Ctrl+Shift+F. I am used to hitting these both pretty often.

Rebuild AST

In case of a conflict (overlapping text edits) a new AST is created with the
changes applied from previous multi fixes.

NLSUtil workingcopy fix

This fix changes NLSUtil such that it works with working copies correctly.
Created attachment 30226
Convert body to block

This adds the clean up:
Convert single statement in control statement body to block

i.e.
if (b)
     foo();
->
if (b) {
     foo();
}

You need to apply patch: 30224: Rebuild AST and 30225: NLSUtil workingcopy fix
first otherwise the tests will fail.
See Bug 117295 for light clean up.
