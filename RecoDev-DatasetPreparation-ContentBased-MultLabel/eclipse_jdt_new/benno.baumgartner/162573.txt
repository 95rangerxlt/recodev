I20061024-1200 + ZRH-plugins from 20061027_1543

The Source > Clean Up wizard always opens with the last used size, and restoring the original size does not work. This is especially bad for users who used the wizard with an older build.

Steps:
- new workspace with I20061017-0800
- create project, open clean up wizard, close without doing anything
- start same workspace with HEAD
- open clean up wizard
=> wizard is too small / contents are cut
=> doubleclicking below the cancel button not restore a default size that shows all contents
