- open StyledText.java
- enable format on save (edited lines)
- replace all " =" with "="
- save

=> takes multiple minutes, not cancellable, no progress
=> expected:
a) is quicker
b) shows cancellable progress after at most 5 seconds (in dialog or in workbench window trim)

Benno please investigate whether the JDT Core patch would fix this. If not investigate where the performance is lost.

If the patch fixes this we'll have to convice JDT Core to put that simple patch into M3.
Without the core fix: 200s
With the core fix: around 3s

I guess there is no need to discuss that any further: we need this core fix!

IMHO a progress bar is not required, as even in this extreme corner case it does not take long enough to be able to press cancel.
