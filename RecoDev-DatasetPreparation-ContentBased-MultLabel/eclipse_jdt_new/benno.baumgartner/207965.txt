Good catch, same for correct indentation. Not a trivial fix.
Should try to fix for M3.

Have to reopen, I made a mistake, need to use TextChangeCompatibility to merge edits.

Verified using I20071101-0010: does not work.

Test Case:
--- %< ---
public class Test {
			int i= 1;		
}
--- %< ---

Enable to format only edited lines, remove trailing whitespace and correct indentation.

Add a space on line 2. And save.
Let's treat the bug as fixed for M3 as the initially reported problem is indeed fixed. There is another case (the one observed in comment 8) where the formatter fails to format the given region correctly. The same problem can be seen when fromatting this line manually. Filed bug 208541 to track this..

I'm experiencing this very same bug, except that trailing whitespace is semi-randomly added and removed inside javadocs if I have 'Format on save (edited lines)' enabled.
