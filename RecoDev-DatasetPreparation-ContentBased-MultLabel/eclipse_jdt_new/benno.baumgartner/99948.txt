Annoying, but shippable. I assume that not many will activate the action on
packages.
can't reproduce. need steps, and the .log.

Not sure whether related:
- the package was empty
- each source folder has its own output folder
- there's a user library (JUnit)
It's a known problem that errors dialogs are shown correctly but also logged.
Won't be fixed for 3.1
The fix is to avoid the unnecessary writes to the log.
