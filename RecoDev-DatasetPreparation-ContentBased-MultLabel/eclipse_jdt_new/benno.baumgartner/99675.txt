- create a new project
- create a new source folder sources
- create a new source folder tests

observe: the new source folder is appended at the end. Interesting is that
source is prepended.

Martin, can you please comment on this.

Martin, can you please comment on this.
Same behaviour as in 3.0.2.
should ideally insert after existing source folders or at the top.
But I think this is minor, suggest to close.
I think this bug makes the New > Source Folder action rather useless, since you
still have to open the build path dialog after having created a source folder.

BTW: adding a source folder on the build path dialog seems to insert it always
at second position after the first source folder.
Position should be the same for both methods (either before all source folders
or after the last source folder).
I opt to improve this. I had the same impresssion as Martin that the current
action forces me to open the build path dialog anyways since source folders
should never be below the JRE container.
