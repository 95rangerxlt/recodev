- In the configure javadoc location dialog, edit something like file://http://www.junit.org/doc

- It takes several seconds until the user control is back

I'm not sure if this is related top the special URL. The validation has been in for a long time. Maybe something changed with the new file system support. I think we probably have to remove the checking as you type.

Seams like java.io.File#exists() is very slow for a non existing network files.
Probably connected to the change of making all file paths network paths.
It does have nothing to do with the change. You can revert to the old version type in a valid network location (starting with file:////) and then change this location to a non valid one (i.e. by adding a space somewhere) and you can see the delay.
You're right. It seems we have to remove the validation as you type.
