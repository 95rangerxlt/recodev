Hi,

Please refer to the attached screenshot, I have a code snippet with
some lines commented off in the end, 

when performing Source / Surround With / if statement,
I see a wrong output, the curly brakets even don't match,
It seems the template has been molested by those ending commets
which also contain curly brackets.

Can reproduce using I20061024-1200.
Moving to JDT UI who owns surround with.
To reproduce, select body and do "Surround With > if...":

    void m() {
        if (true) {
            System.out.println("T");
        } //else {
            //System.out.println("F");
        //}
    }
