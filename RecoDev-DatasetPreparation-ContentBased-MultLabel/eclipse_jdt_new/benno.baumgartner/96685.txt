It would be extremely helpful if there was a quickfix on Java errors that 
would allow the user to change the severity of the problem. I am specifically 
thinking if the case in bug 96671 where I needed to change the preference to 
make the error a warning. I changed the global preference before realizing it 
was a project preference. It would have been neat in this case to have had a 
CTRL-1 hint that said "Change the 'Discouraged access' severity of project 
org.eclipse.pde.build to Warning".

Could do this in the new problems hover.
Martin, this would fit nice into that work. I guess the only missing part here would be mapping that links the problem ID to our preference constants.
That's correct. I filed bug 218603 for the jdt/core API request.
Martin, I filed a request for the toolbar icon, see bug 219612. I hope that's ok for you.

Hehe, that's pretty cool stuff! The tool bar icon is terrible, but I should get one from the designer till next week.
