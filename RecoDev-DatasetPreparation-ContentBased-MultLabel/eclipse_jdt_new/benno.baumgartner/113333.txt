Version: 3.2.0
Build id: N20051018-0010

I would like to change the behavior of ContentAssistant#setMessage (or add a new
method) such that a message is displayed at the bottom of the pop up also if
ContentAssistant#setCyclingMode is set to false.

I also whould like to have something like ContentAssistant#clearMessage or
ContentAssistant#setMessage(null) which should result in removing the label at
the bottom of the pop up. At the moment I use setMessage("") which does not
remove the label.

Thanks.

Valid request.
Mmm, seams like a lot have changed in the relevant sections of the code. I'm extending ICompletionProposalExtension2 and what I want is to display a message on the bottom of the completion proposal popup when I get a calls to 

public void unselected(ITextViewer viewer)
public void selected(ITextViewer viewer, boolean smartToggle)

Is there allready a way to do this? 

We need to consider pulling the added methods out to IContentAssistantExtensionX.

You can now control the status line (setStatusLineVisible), its contents (setStatusMessage) and the repetition mode (setRepeatedInvocationMode) separately.

Note that all the methods introduced into ContentAssistant in 3.2 have been pulled up to a new interface, IContentAssistantExtension2.
