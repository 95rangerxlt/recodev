The results should explain what the problem is, like the old NLS Keys search did, e.g.
  Unused keys in: messages.properties

Actuall, it behaves as in 3.1 where unused keys in property files are explained but not matches in Java code.
So do you think it should be change or left as it was?
To make it more consistent we could remove the "Unused keys in:" from properties file matches and change the view description to:
"Broken keys in <selection goes here>"

There are three possible matches:
Unused keys in: foobar.properties
Duplicat keys in: foobar.properties
Undefined keys in: foobar.java
