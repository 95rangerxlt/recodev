2. Enable Missing Serial version ID>Generated
3. Next
Is:
 Clean up does make calculations ending up in warning:
Could not calculate a serial version id for Test. The type will be ignored
Should:
 For enum types, the serialVersionUID does not make sense. See
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/pdf/serial-1.5.0.pdf . The clean up should not
