Done.

Benno, more important than adding the entry there is to set the iplog flag on the patch to '+'. The 'contributed' keyword is no longer used.
Benny (and Benno ;-) next time please don't forget to
- update the copyright date
- add the copyright entry to *all* files
- use this pattern for the entry:
Real Full Name <e-mail> - bug summary from bugzilla - full URL
e.g.
Benjamin Muskalla <bmuskalla@eclipsesource.com> - [templates] new SWT templates - ToolBar and ToolItem - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=264052

Thanks.
