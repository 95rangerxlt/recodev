  workbench window
- Properties dialog is caused by PropertyDialogAction which takes a shell
  in the constructor.
Updated the Window code for selecting the default parent such that it picks the
right Shell for detached windows, and made it fault-tolerant if
Display.getActiveShell() returns a bad result.

Fixed NewProjectAction (now uses the default parent)

Partially fixed PropertyDialogAction (it now has a new constructor that takes an
IShellProvider. JDT will need to update their code to call the new constructor).

Moving to JDT so that they can make use of the new PropertyDialogAction constructor.

Tod: Feel free to roll back my changes to Window if you find them distasteful. :-)

Stefan,

why is this IShellProvider stuff necessary. It adds another sort of complexity.
Why can't the action simply take a site as all the others do. If Platform/UI
needs to create the action without a site then they should add some special code.

Moving to Platform/UI for reconsidering the API.
IWorkbenchSite extends IShellProvider, so the action CAN take a site.

IShellProvider can be implemented by clients and IWorkbenchSite cannot.

IShellProvider is a standard interface for anything that can be the parent of a
JFace window or dialog, whereas IWorkbenchSite is specific to certain aspects of
the workbench.

In other words, IShellProvider is more loosely coupled from the workbench.

What is it in particular that you don't like?

Nick, can you provide a reference to the PR where you first suggested
IShellProvider?
Sorry Stefan I didn't notice that a site extends a shell provider.
This has been fixed but not marked as resolved > 20050412-0800
