When a statement is unnessarily nested within an else clause, quick fix
suggests to "surround with runnable". Which is of course incorrect.

I'm using 3.2m5, check the quick fix on the else.
(Java->Compiler->Errors/Warnings->Unnessary else statement  = Warning)

package demo;

public class TestElse {

    public void main(String args[]) {
        if (true) {
            return;
        } else {   
            return;
        }
    }
}

Move to JDT/UI
we should detect this and not show the 'surround with runnable' here.
