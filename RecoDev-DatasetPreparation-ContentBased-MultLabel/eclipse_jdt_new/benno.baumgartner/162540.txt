If clean up is executed on the active editor then it must use the editor's AST (via ASTProvider) and not create a second one.
This might be difficult in the general case. AFAIK, the clean up ASTs use special compiler settings to get all the necessary problems from core. However, should see what can be done. It would probably work in the common case that the user has enabled all necessary problems for the selected clean ups.
