Benno, this will effectively move the working set block near the top of the wizard. I assume JDT is ok with this move as it makes working sets more first class.

Why do you think so? The WS group on the new java project wizard will stay exactly where it is at the moment: The last group. 
Ah, I guess if you don't use the WizardNewProjectCreationPage's fancy new constructor and just use the WorkingSetGroup, you can create the control manually still.

The question is, is it time to move it to another location to present users a more first class view of working sets?
In the end, I want PDE and JDT treat where working sets belong in a wizard the same way.

JavaProjectWizardFirstPage does not subclass WizardNewProjectCreationPage...

Yes, that would be preferable. I think the WS group is the least interesting group on the new java project wizard and should therefore be the last one. And I think this holds for every new project wizard...
