- Combos need setVisibleItemCount(20)
- Better copyright warning message: "This operation repacks referenced libraries. [..]"
Wizard title message should tell that this only works for Java Application launch configs, e.g. "Select a 'Java Application' launch configuration to use to create a runnable JAR."

Do field labels really have to start with "Select"?. I think
"&Launch configuration:" (or "'Java Application' &launch configuration:") and
"Export &destination:" would be enough.
- the margin between label and combo is too big
