I'm currently using the clean up wizard with different settings per project (one for legacy code, one for new code). It would be nice if this per-project settings would be available for the new "Clean Up On Safe", too. I.e., when saving the current editor, the project specific "Clean Up On Safe" settings should be used and not the workspace settings.

fix

This path adds a project property page 'Save Action'. It's a top level node for now, will have to introduce a java editor node. Other thing to do: Get rid of concept of profiles for clean up save participant.

Review if you want, see i.e. IPreferenceAndPropertyConfigurationBlock and AbstractConfigurationBlockPreferenceAndPropertyPage (what a nice name;-)
