3.1-RC2 test pass

- Java project property dialog, build path, library tab
- add a JRE container and a user library container

- Edit the javadoc location of a jar within the JRE library
- Edit the javadoc location of a jar within the user library

Note:
- the jre's javadoc location is persisted in the workspace preferences. Going to
the 'Installed JREs' prefernce page shows the modified javadoc location (This is
true whether the property dialog was closed using Ok or Cancel).
- the user library's javadoc location is not persisted with the user library
preferences in the workspace, but only changed within the project that was modified.

Expected: Javadoc (and source) locations for user libraries and JREs behave the
same way. I would prefer to modify the workspace preferences, but the important
thing is that the behavior is consistent.

Not critical for 3.1.

Martin, this their any rational behind this.
its a bug on the user libarry preference page to not update the internal model
when it was changed from the outside.
