Build id: I20051213-0010

Followup on bug #114025. 

* Select properties of a java project > Java Build Path > Source. 
* Link in a source, name the folder "test". 
* Click OK and OK again. Folder is linked in as "test". 
* Go to the source tab again, select the linked folder, select "Edit".
* Edit ONLY the linked folder name => an interesting warning is displayed
* click OK and OK again
* Folder name is not updated in the package explorer, and it is also not there when re-opening the properties.

Additional issue: When editing the name of the linked folder AND the destination, no warning is displayed and the old linked folder is still there when closing the properties view.

Minor issue: The linked source folder disappears from the list when selecting "Edit" and re-appears when selecting "ok".

Wrong component, sorry. Moved to JDT/UI.
fixed > 20060103

The strange warning as well as the minor issue will be fixed later when refactoring the dialog to a wizard page.
