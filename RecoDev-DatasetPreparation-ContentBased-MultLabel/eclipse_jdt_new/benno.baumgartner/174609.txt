Regression from what? It always used to do this, didn't it?
Maybe regression is not the right term. But as soon as we will use the clean up for sort members action it will be a regression. Therefor this is blocking bug 133277
I don't see why this is blocking. You get this same behaviour in Eclipse 3.2.1 as well.

There used to be a warning message shown in 3.1 that you'd lose bookmarks if you sorted members, but that's not been shown in the 3.2 days.

I personally think this bug is valid, but that it shouldn't block the bug 133277 since you get the same behaviour with or without 133277 in Eclipse 3.2/Eclipse 3.3

Alex.
The fact that 3.2.1 does not show the warning is a bad regression, a must fix and 3.2.1 should absolutely show this dialog. It's not good that we did not see this regression (we need a test for that). This is a blocker because I can not fix bug 133277 without this being fixed. Which is the definition of a blocker after all.
The patch for 133277 doesn't affect the existing behaviour in any way, though. The fact that no warning is shown is the same behaviour, but a separate and unrelated bug (i.e. this one). Whether this is fixed before 133277 or after 133277 is changed makes no difference; this bug does not 'block' it in any way. The fact is that the current and suggested future behaviour do not affect this bug whatsoever.

So, to summarise: the behaviour in 133277 is the same as the previous release of Eclipse. 133277 provides additional functionality (i.e. the ability to sort multiple projects), and 133277 blocks other potential code contributions I can make (e.g. the refactoring of other cleanup actions as noted there). However, the fact that it's not there is blocking me from doing any further work on that.

The fact that this (bug 174609) may be a 'serious' bug that needs attention and should be fixed is not in question. But I do not believe that it makes sense to delay any further contributions that I can make in the 3.3M6 timeframe. To be honest, I spent a lot of time investigating providing additions to the CompilationUnitSorter.sort method to take an array of array of ints, since that API was designed to be able to track multiple marker positions for sorting (whereas the older/current implementation just provides sorting one at a time) which was always intended to be used by tracking changes of bookmarks to a resource -- and the pushback was to use an ICleanUp instead, which I did.

In summary; there's three possible outcomes here:
1) Fix the sort itself so that it doesn't mangle the bookmarks and/or applies changes afterwards
2) Fix the SMA to pop up a dialog message as before (or even integrate it into the current warning label that's shown), and look at back-porting that to the SMCleanUp
3) Leave it as a problem in 3.3 as well and don't enable the cleanup functionality for no particularly good reason

My money's on 3.
Don't worry Alex, I'll like to fix this one, it's a challenging bug... Lets try 1!
We could be working in parallel on other cleanups though if 133277 was applied. Plus, it would then make it easier to work on a fix for this with the 'new' code instead of having to reapply the diffs to the patches in that one.

Note also that bug 172801 has done some refactoring of the methods that would be used here, and would also be applicable prior to this bug being addressed.

fix

I honestly tried to fix 1) but it is too difficult, some say it's impossible. I was close though, but Redo/Undo made it infeasible. Anyway, fixed 2), show a warning to user if file contains Task/Bookmark/Breakpoint. Also added tests to prevent another regression.

Great stuff!
