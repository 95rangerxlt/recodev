- Enable 'Sort members' in clean up
- Disable to sort fields and enums
- use clean up on the following file

public interface Main {
  public final String PREFIX =  "."; //$NON-NLS-1$
  public static final String PROP1 = PREFIX + "AncestorVisible"; //$NON-NLS-1$
  public static final String PROP2 = PREFIX + "IgnoreAncestor"; //$NON-NLS-1$

}

result does not compile. The problem must be the different modifiers (meaning the same in an interface)

This leads to broken code. Should investigate for M6 as fixed other bugs in this area for M6 already.
Created attachment 93573
fix

probably like this since day one.
- Not a regression
- Not a new feature
- Not a major bug
- Not a trivial fix
-> Not for M6
I agree with comment 3. The bug must have been there for a longer time.

The fix/test had nothing to do with the reported problem. Will fix with bug 407759.
