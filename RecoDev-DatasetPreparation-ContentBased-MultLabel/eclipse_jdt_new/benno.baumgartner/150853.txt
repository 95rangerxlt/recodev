'Remove unused imports' quick fix doesn't work on imports of non-existing classes.

Example:

//A.java
import foo.Bar;
public class A {}

//B.java
import foo.Bar;
public class B {}

Click on 'The import foo cannot be resolved' entry in Problems view and select QuickFix, then 'Find Similar Problems' (the other class appears on the 'Problems' list), 'Select All' and 'OK'. Progress bar appears and then window is closed and nothing happens. There are no errors in Error Log view.

Hint that the quick fix works fine, it's "only" the clean up/multi fix which does not work for unresolved imports.
