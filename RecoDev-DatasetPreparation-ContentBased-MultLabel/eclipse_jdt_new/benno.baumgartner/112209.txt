In 3.1, the Open Type dialog was enhanced to have a memory of previously opened
types, and to prioritize the list based on that history.  It'd be great if the
dialog to resolve ambiguous imports used the same sort of history to promote the
previously selected type to the top of the list, and have it as the default
selected.

The use case I run into this annoyance is when I add the List class to my code.
99.999% of the time, I want java.util.List rather than java.awt.List, but the
AWT one is always up at the top of the dialog when I perform organize imports. 
If java.util.List was at the top, and default selected, I'd only need to hit
enter to get the right selection the majority of the time.

This is on the M5 plan and has been implemented last week. The history is also available in code assist. Use next integration build or wait for M5 to have this feature available. 


[organize imports] should prioritize previously selected ambiguous imports
