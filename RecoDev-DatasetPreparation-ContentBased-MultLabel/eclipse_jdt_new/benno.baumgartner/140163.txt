To reproduce:
1. Open the new Java Project Wizard throgh clicking on New Java Project button in the toolbar
2. Type in a name
3. click next
4. click the help button in the lower left corner or press F1
Is:
  Nothing happens
5. Select the 'Source'
6. Click the button or press F1

Now the correct help is shown.

Not sure why that is. I guess because the focus is on the 'Back' button. When the wizard is started through 'New->Project->Java Project' a help is shown, but the wrong one.

To fix this you need to set the focus on the page content when entering your wizard pages. Otherwise the focus is on the Next button or some other control, and you are effectively asking for help on that control. In the case of the general purpose wizard dialog there's no help so you get nothing, but in the case of the new dialog they do actually set overall help on the dialog so it gets that one.

I would recommend setting focus on what the user should do first. For example for the first page it would make sense to have focus on the project name text field so the user can just start typing right away. Otherwise if they want to use the keyboard they have to tab, tab, tab until it gets to the first field, or use mnemonics.

Sorry for not getting back to you earlier on this one, I missed it. Sending to JDT.
Ok, I see... Thanks
