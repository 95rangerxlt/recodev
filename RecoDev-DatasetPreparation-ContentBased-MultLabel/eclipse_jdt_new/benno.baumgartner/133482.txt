Have a package with a CU and a properties file (no accessor class).

The current message when executing the Find Broken NLS Keys action is:
"No NLS property files found in selection"

While this is technically correct it can confuse users since there is a (maybe a left-ofver) properties file.

Note: the message should also end with a '.'

Improved message could be:
"No NLS property files with corresponding accessor class found in selection."
