3.3 RC2

Found while verifying bug 188910.

The Clean Up wizard allows to Finish with 0 or >1 selected profiles. This is not good as the user has no clue which one got applied.

As this is probably an easy fix I suggest to fix for RC3.

As this is probably an easy fix I suggest to fix for RC3.
Selecting an item in the table has only an effect for the 'Configure...' button, this works as specified. The table informs the user which profiles are used for which project. 

However, multi selection in the table is not necessary and can be disabled, not sure if this is RC3 though. Dani, I would need two +1 from two component leads... Your call.

And what's the point of having no selection?

Not really. Martin will have to promote it for RC3 and then I'll give my OK.

The patch also fixes the no selection case: Patch makes sure that exactly one item is selected at all time.

Aha, ok, sorry Martin...

I think this doesn't qualify as a critical fix, so we should fix this in 3.4.
