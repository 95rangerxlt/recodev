fix for missing Class-Path entry

Build ID: I20080219-1124

Steps To Reproduce:
1. File > Export > Java/Runnable JAR File 
2. Wizard Page "Runnable JAR File Specification" shows up
3. check "save ANT File"
4. Click "Finish"

The created build.xml does not create a Class-Path entry with the value "."

More information:
The Jar file created with the wizard has the following Entry in its Manifest:
[---]
Class-Path: .
[---]

The Jar file created via the saved ANT script does not contain this Attribute.

This entry is not neccessary, but property files or other resources outside of the JAR file will not be found.

Another Bug is fixed in the Path, which has no relevance at the moment.
JarWriter4 supports adding content from Jar-Files. If the destination-Jar is not compressed the CRC Value of the source is reused. Because of a typo the CompressedSize was set instead of the CRC:

old:
newEntry.setCompressedSize(zipEntry.getCrc());

new:
newEntry.setCrc(zipEntry.getCrc());

It has no relevance, because the default for creating Jars is "compressed" and it can not changed in the "Runnable Jar File" Export wizard.

For both patches Testcases have been added.


the patch contains an uneccessary piece of code

ui/org/eclipse/jdt/ui/tests/jarexport/FatJarExportTests.java
line 205:  data.setCompress(false);

will remove this with the next patch.
