does the new formatter do this?
Asking formatter provider.


Formatting will regenerate whitespaces, thus perform the trimming as a side 
effect, but it will also reformat entire source, which is more than asked by 
this feature request.

Back to UI for consideration. Seems like a standard editor service.

AnyEdit tools plugin adds this feature for all text based editors. This is of 
course only possible with "illegal" hacking in Eclipse core (and could *not* be 
a solution for this bug) but does the job well:
http://andrei.gmxhome.de/anyedit/index.html

Also I think this bug is closely related to bug 22742, because one usually does 
such changes on "save" action.


*** Bug 118026 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Note that with 3.1 M3 there's now a "Remove Trailing Whitespace" command which
allows to remove the trailing spaces either for the current editor or for a
bunch of files (e.g. selected project). Currently this command isn't surfaced in
the UI you have to bind it to a key sequence via Keys preference page. It's in
the "File" category.
Although providing such an command is a good idea, I'm sure, it would be even better to have it done by default for Java files. For other file types in /might/ be necessary to have trailing whitespace, but not so for Java files. And it's not a good idea to always need to invoke the mentioned command on all projects, especially since they might contain non-Java-files which need trailing whitespace, before committing the changes into repository.
Please don't stripp lines with only white space or take indentation into consideration. I'm sure a lot of people would like tab+cr+lf remain unaffected after tab+}+cr+lf. For me it would be good enough to just strip all white space after the last non white space char on a line. That would leave extra tabs on a few lines but avoid the need to parse indentation.
Roger, I don't understand. Why you would need to keep empty lines containing just whitespace?
Thomas, personally I don't need it. But people get upset on me when I remove all their tabs (on "empty" lines). A lot of editors, Eclipse included, adds tabs on empty lines for indentation when you keep hitting return. Some people like to keep them. I'm sure it would create a lot of "noice" in some version control systems if a lot of empty lines became even emptier.

I just think it would be safer to keep tabs on empty lines but I'm sure some people would consider it a bug.

Will this small RFE finally, after 2 1/2 years, be added? It would make a lot of people happy, which prefer to have absolutely clear source code. Of course, with an option, so people Roger told about will have not problems.
The trailing code itself is indeed a small RFE but to hook it correctly into the save process along with validateEdit (for repositories) and failure  handling is a bit more complicated.

For those wanting this badly I suggest to participate in the eclipse project and attach a good quality patch.
Yes, the hook to the save process was (is) the main problem in AnyEdit... E.g. if one use file->save, or "ctrl+s" it works as expected, but on "editor right click"->save nothing happens, cause this is *another one* save action. I think, there is already a bug/RFE somewhere about how to participate in save process.
Just curious, isn't there just *one* place to save the file content? If there are multiple ones, for what reasons they exist? Are there different ways needed to write an, for example, Java file? Maybe understanding this, might help to understand why such a small (from a plain user's point of view) RFE need so much time to be implemented.

Please dont' understand me wrong, I don't want to bash the Eclipse code (I don't know it) - I just want to understand the ideas behind.
All places (menu, context menu, short cut, etc.) go through the same code for the Java editor, but as said before, the problem is repository interaction, error handling and how/what to revert in such a case.
I'm not very familiar with what hooks Eclipse plugins have available to them, but those who use IntelliJ on my team have what seems like ideal trailing whitespace handling: trailing whitespace is removed on save, but only from added/modified lines. We have perforce integration in IntelliJ, and also in Eclipse, but the option isn't available in Eclipse. Because we do a lot of cross- and down-integration, any more aggressive whitespace removal policy (such as remove all trailing whitespace on save) causes extra merge conflicts. Our team has been discouraged from using Eclipse until this capability is available.

This option addresses the problem Roger Perttu mentioned, where removing whitespace from all empty lines would cause "noise" in version control systems.

IDEA has options, whether to
- not remove trailing whitespace,
- to remove trailing whitespace only on changed lines or
- to remove trailing whitespace on all lines in modified files.

The noise-problem in version control systems only are valid for files with useless trailing whitespace. If all team members would have this option enabled, there will no noise-problem occur any more.

Come on, please give us the small option - the Eclipse team can solve much larger problems. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. ;)

jEdit has had for ages a plugin called WhiteSpace[1] -- apart from showing all whitespace inside an editor (another useful feature by the way) it can remove trailing whitespace and is configurable enough to satisfy anyone I believe. Worth taking a look.

Great. Where can I select this feature?
