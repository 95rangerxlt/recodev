Given:
package test;
public class E<I> {
	private int i;
	public void foo() {
		System.out.println(i);
	}
}

With unqualified field accesses set to warning
1. Ctrl-1 on the warning at 'i'
Is:
	No quick fix to qualify 'i' is avilable
Sould:
	Qualify with 'this'

Same for:
public class Klass<T> {
	public int i;
	public void foo() {
		Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		};
	}
}

No Quick fix proposal is shown for i access.

The same holds for the 'Qualify non static field and method accesses' clean up.
