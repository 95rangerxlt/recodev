3.3

If CTRL + 1 finds warnings or errors on the same line, it jumps to the closest error and offers proposals for that error.

Users would like to have more control over that:
- they didn't want to fix the closest error but do a quick assist at the cursor location (see bug 201872)
- they want to fix a different bug on the same line (or close to the cursor)
- they want to fix an error on a different line

proposed fix

'Ctrl-1' to go to original position, if position was updated. The multi quick fix message wins over this message (if any).

Dani, more for you to review;-) The fix is almost trivial, maybe too trivial?
Patch goes into the right direction. I've committed the Platform Text change (added missing @since 3.4 tag and removed "(non-Javadoc)" as this will be need anyway.

Some remaining issues:
- If the current position is a valid quick fix position (or there's no
  error on that line at all) then pressing Ctrl+1 again closes and reopens
  the same list. This should not happen.
- Status text should read "Press .... (like in content assist and quick views)
- The key binding must not be hard-coded. This will also fix the current
  usage of '-' instead of '+'.
- After going to original position status text should read:
  "Press 'KEY BINDING' to go to closest problem"
