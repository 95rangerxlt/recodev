3.7.

For 3.7.1 we need to add Java 7 support to Debug, e.g. update the evaluation support.

This should be done by end of June, so that we have enough time for team wide testing and fixing in July.

update

This patch makes the updates to jdt.debug to update how we create ASTs and to use the new UnifiedType ASTNode in our ASTVisitors.

Tested so far:
1. in-editor evaluations - Inspect / Display
2. Watch expressions
3. the ToggleBreakpointAdapter

Still to be tested
1. conditional breakpoints
2. logical structures
3. detail formatters
Additional items that have been tested:

1. Run to Line
2. Debug variable hovers
I am unable to get string switch statements to work anywhere in the debug framework (they work when running as a java application).  Opened bug 350325
