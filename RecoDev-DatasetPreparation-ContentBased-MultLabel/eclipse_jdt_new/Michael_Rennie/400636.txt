This appears to be a regression in Kepler M5. When debugging an Eclipse Application, codeassist does not work in Display view. This worked in Kepler M4.

Not sure if this makes any difference, I am on OSX 10.8.2 with Oracle Java 1.7.0_10.

proposed fix

I was wrong, this is not a regression in M5, the same behaviour exists in M4 (did not check previous releases). Here is a trivial that shows the problem.

    import java.math.BigDecimal;
    public class Test
    {
        public static void main( String[] args )
        {
            BigDecimal boo = null;
            System.out.println( boo ); // << breakpoint here
        }
    }

From what I can tell, CurrentFrameContext#getLocalVariables chokes when local variable declared type has not been loaded by the target vm.
Thanks for taking the time to track this down Igor.

I pushed a slightly modified version of the patch to:
