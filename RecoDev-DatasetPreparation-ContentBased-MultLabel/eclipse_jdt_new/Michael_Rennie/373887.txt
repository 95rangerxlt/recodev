The launchingsupport.jar library is now built manually and stored in the repository.  It was mentioned in bug 369480 that the jar should be built with customCallbacks, however, I have not found a bug for that, so I am opening this one.

Since pre-built jar is not acceptable for fedora, I have implemented partial solution for that. Feel free to use it.

See bug 324794 comment 2. Does that not work for you?

Nevermind. That's a different jar.
I'd keep the pre-built JAR for us, but we could do the same as bug 324794 comment 4.

The interesting parts of that patch are the <available file=..> at the beginning and <target name="pre.@dot" ..> and following lines.

Why?

Patch - the lazy approach

The patch connects existing lib build script with pde builds and runs only if the lib is missing.

Forget the patch. It was wrongly generated.
