Version: 3.8.0
Build id: I20120103-0800

If I add an expression to the Expressions view, which has child element.  Then I modify the value of that child element using the cell editor.  The cell editor accepts the new value but does not refresh.  If I switch focus to another view and come back to the expressions view, the new value is shown.  

The same use case works correctly in Variables view.

Confirmed the problem, which existed in 3.7 and 3.6.

Wonder if it is related to bug 368276.

patch for this bug

Modified ExpressionEventHandler to also handle events with source as IVariable (not just IExpression). DefaultExpressionModelProxy is already handling events with source as IVariable, but ExpressionEventHandler  was not handling events from IVariable.
