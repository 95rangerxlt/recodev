Eclipse 2.0.1 & 2.1, Windows 2000 & Windows NT

When I open the Open Type Dialog, my CPU is pegged for as long as the dialog is 
open.  Not sure what it is doing in there, but it seems unlikely that it needs 
to work that hard just sitting open.

it's actually adding table items to the open type dialog, which is done in a 
background thread. If you open the dialog and scroll down, you will see that 
items are added for a couple of seconds. There was another request that type's 
should only appear if the name field is not empty, which was the original 
behaviour. Would you agree with this solution as well?

Ok.. it does eventually stop, but it takes much longer than a couple of 
seconds - about 4-5 minutes for my current workspace.  I only noticed that it 
eventually stops because I left it up during a meeting when I got your reply to 
the PR.  

Waiting for a text entry would be fine.  Since the root cause is the same as 
the other bug, please feel free to mark this as a duplicate.
