Build 20020321

In a former build the editor allowed my to edit arguments automatically filled 
in on method completion. This feature is removed. I find the new bahavior very 
unsatisfactory.

Please give me the old behaviour back !

Intentionally removed due to the template nesting issue.

We can do one slight improvement. The first inserted argument should be 
selected so that the user can immediately start typing. 
yes, bring it back, +1 from me
regarding nesting - disabling it in some tricky cases like that if fine for me
i want it back mostly in normal editing mode
as soon as i type template mode, fine, i can live without this feature
inconsistency is minimal and a cool feature is back
fixed >= 20020412
implemented what Adam requested


Fill arguments on method completion don't allow editing anymore
