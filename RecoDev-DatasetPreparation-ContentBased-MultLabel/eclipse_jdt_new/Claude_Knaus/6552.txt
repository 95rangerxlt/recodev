When using the shift right command in the Java editor tabs are inserted in 
front of the line. This also happens even if the the user selected to use 
spaces instead of tabs in the Java preferences.

If the user, in the preferences screen, set the setting to use spaces instead 
of tabs then shift right should spaces also instead of tabs.

When using the shift right command in the Java editor tabs are inserted in

If the user, in the preferences screen, set the setting to use spaces instead 
of tabs then shift right should spaces also instead of tabs.
Also, this problem is also the case for shifting left and general editing.

When shifting left the editor always removes 1 tab or up to 4 spaces (whatever 
is first in the line). If the editor is set up to use spaces instead of tabs 
shift left should remove spaces so the text moves the given number of places to 
the left.

Also, even when the "use spaces instead of tabs" option is set tabs are 
inserted instead of spaces when the tabs key are hit. I am aware that this 
option is mainly intended for the "Format" feature but it makes sense also to 
apply it to editing.
This bugs was tested against R1.0 and against stable build 20011107 and found 
in both versions.
