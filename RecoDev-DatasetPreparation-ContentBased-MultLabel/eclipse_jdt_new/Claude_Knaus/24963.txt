Enable 'eating code assist'.
Given this code
	public void setNewName(String newName) {
		Assert.isNotNull(newName);
	}
Do code assist after 'Assert.'
1. No eating range marked. I think 'isNotNull' should be marked
2. While the dialog is still up, press twice 'cursor right' and once 'cursor 
left'. The eating range consist of one letter. very strange
