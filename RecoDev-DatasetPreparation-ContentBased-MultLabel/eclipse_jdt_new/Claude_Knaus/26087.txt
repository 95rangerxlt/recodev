Smoke for 20021113

1. Open TestCase.java
2. Press Ctrl
3. Click on the title bar of the Package Explorer (while Ctrl pressed)
4. Move mouse over editor (which does not have focus)
==> types and methods get blue underlined but when I press the left mouse
nothing happens (except the editor getting the focus).

The state that Ctrl is pressed should probably be reset if the editor looses focus.

It works for me with the smoke test plugin export.
