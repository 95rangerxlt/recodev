Incremental search should not wrap by default (e.g. start searching from top if 
end of file has been reached). 

In large files with lots of occurrences of the search string the user has to 
keep an eye on the scroll bar to figure out if he already has visited the match.

Incremental search should not wrap by default (e.g. start searching from top if 
end of file has been reached). 

In large files with lots of occurrences of the search string the user has to 
keep an eye on the scroll bar to figure out if he already has visited the match.
The people I asked thought that wrapping should be default.
Whom did you ask ? All editors I know at least ask the user if thee should wrap 
when the hit the end of a file. Otherwise it is really hard to use in large 
files.
agreed on respecting the wrap setting of the find/replace dialog.
Perhaps we could immitate Emacs behaviour?

If you search at the end of the file, it just beeps.

But if you search once more, it wraps.

This way the user gets better feedback that the search has wrapped.

I second this behavior modification as this is the default emacs behavior.
Emacs behaviour has been implemented by Adam Schlegel.
It's in 2.0.
