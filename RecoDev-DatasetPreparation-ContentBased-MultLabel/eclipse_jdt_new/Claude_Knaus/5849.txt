build 20011106

-Open org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.java in the java editor.
-Place the cursor somewhere at the beginning of a line near the top of the file
-Press and hold the delete key to delete the line
->You should see a reasonably smooth delete operation

-Go a few pages down in the file (within the top 1/8 of the file is enough)
-Press and hold the delete key to delete one of the public static fields
->The delete operation is so slow that the screen doesn't update anymore.
Something is taking away too many CPU cycles.
