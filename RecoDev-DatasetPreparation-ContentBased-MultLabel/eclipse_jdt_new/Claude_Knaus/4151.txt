EG (24.08.2001 14:42:59)
	value hovering should show the runtime type in addition to the value

NOTES:
Example

int size -> hover "size = 3"   (could honor asymmetric assign formatting pref)
Object o -> hover "o = java.util.Vector(id=99)
Asymmetric assignment is for assignment only. Since the user is inspecting a
variable, if anything else than "value = 42", it should be "value == 42".
I think " == " is a bit ugly, so I'd stick with " = ".
I could argue that this value was assigned at some point, this isn't code <g>
Interestingly the variables view inside the debugger is using asymmetric 
assignment. Bottom line " = " is fine
