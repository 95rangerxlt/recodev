When in template editing mode (red underline) typing ESC should not discard my 
input.
Reasoning: sometimes I pick an entry from code assist without being aware that 
it is a template. If I just continue (blind) typing the arguments, I don't 
immediately notice that I'm in 'edit template arguments' mode. Sometimes later 
if I happen to see the red underline I want to leave the mode by pressing the 
ESC key. This discards all my input.

it's not the same bug.

Behaviour is not as expected. Now, the template remains but the changes inside 
the template disapear. >20020319. Reopening. JRT.
It's fixed in the workspace. Will be in next build after 20020319-I.
