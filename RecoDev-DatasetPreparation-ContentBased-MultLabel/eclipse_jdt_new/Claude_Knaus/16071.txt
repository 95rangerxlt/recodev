Build M5

When you press the Home key while doing an incremental search, the search 
seems to get into a strange 'partially cancelled' state:

1) Enter the following Java code into a file:

public class A {
public void foo() {}
}


2) Press Ctrl+J to start incremental search

3) type public 
 - the first public should be highlighted

4) press the down arrow 
 - the second public should be highlighted

5) press Home
 - incremental search appears to be cancelled

6) press Shift+Down arrow
 - incremental search appears to be enabled again! And it's selected the 
second 'public' again, instead of selecting the line

Home doesn't completely cancel incremental search
