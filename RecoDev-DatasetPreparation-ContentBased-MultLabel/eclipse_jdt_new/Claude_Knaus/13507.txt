LinkedPositionUI(ITextViewer, LinkedPositionManager) - 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.link.LinkedPositionUI has a reference to 
SWT.COLOR_RED which will be unreadble if the user sets their background colour 
to Red.

We will be adding a getErrorText colour to JFaceColours in build >20020411. You 
may want to use that.

there should be a prefernce to change the template variable color
There is now a JFaceColors entry getErrorText() which returns the JFace colour 
setting for errors. You may want to use this rather than creating another 
preference.
It's not showing any errors, so I don't intend to use it. :)
Please remove the ref to SWT.COLOR_RED if you're not using it then.

I am using color red for now, that doesn't mean it is an error. I see that it's 
confusing because errors are now red, too. Therefore, I will change it to be 
configurable.
The problem is that we need to avoid hardcoded colours for accessibility 
reasons. If it's configurable, that's OK.  
Please also describe how to cause this to occur so we can test for 
accessibility.
