In the new class wizard, the checkbox for enclosing type doesn't appear in the 
tab order.  The JDT code doesn't seem to be doing any magic.
It's actually working.  The first traversable widget in the tree is the 
checkbox.  To see this, tab all the way to the Cancel button and hit one more 
tab.  Focus goes to the checkbox.

So, here's what's happening.  The rule is that tab groups are traversed in the 
order that they are created, typically using the tab keys.  When a tab group 
contains another tab group, focus is given first to the default tab group and 
then the other tab groups.  The default tab group consists of all non-tab group 
widgets (such as check and radio buttons) that are not enclosed in another tab 
group.  Non-tab item widgets are typically traversed using the arrow keys.

This algorithm, while leading to some confusion for the developer, ensures that 
every widget will be traversable.

MCQ, do you want to reword this and add it to the SWT JavaDoc?
I believe the wizard creates the controls top-down.
Are you saying they need to enclose the checkbox in another composite so that 
it creates a new tab group?
Please advise on how JDT should change their code (NewClassCreationWizardPage).

Yes, enclose it in a composite (a composite is a tab group), then there will no 
longer be a "default tab group" and traversal will work the way you expect.
JTD should try the new composite work around.
claude can you pls give it try
The workaround would work. However, I'm getting contradictory information about
what the behaviour should be for default tab group.
Either the default tab group elements are traversed inorder (interleaved) with
the other tab groups in the oder of creation, or they are traversed first
(that's what seems to be happening now).
What is the reasoning for having this default tab group to be visited first?

Added SN to CC list so he can answer the question.
