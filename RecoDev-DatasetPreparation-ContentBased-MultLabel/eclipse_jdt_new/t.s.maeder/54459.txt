in the new search results view, I happen to have to click a lot to expand the
trees so I can finally double click the method element to open the editor.

What I always expect is that doouble clicking the type opens the editor and I'm
always irritated that it doesn't, propably because in all other views (package
explorer, hierarchy, outline) this is the case. is there a good reason why not
offering this short cut?

Thomas, we should consider this for 3.0. I got tricked by it as well.
Added a void handleOpen(OpenEvent) on AbstractTextSearchResult. Java search now
opens types, files, etc. on double click.


New search view: Double click on type should open CU [search]



fix for bug 54459
