I like the new (M6) feature of the "Simplified search context menu", but would 
like to see "Occurrences in file" added to the menu.

Yes, I know this ("Occurrences in file") is available from the top level search 
menu, and via keyboard shortcut... but to be honest it took me over an hour to 
figure that out (I typically use the search from the menu in the content, 
rather than the top level menu).

I mention this as the feature docs suggest you are looking for feedback.

Please forgive me if I filed this "bug" incorrectly, I am unfamiliar with the 
categories here.
