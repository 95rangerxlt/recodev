I'm using the flat layout & choose to sort by parent name, but this setting is 
not propagated to new search views in other perspectives/windows.
Thomas, can you please investigate what the bahaviour in the old search view 
is ? I think it was the same since sorting and filtering is per viewer.
Flat/Tree and sort order are not global settings, they are per view. Is that
what you're seeing or is there something else? It's a feature.
What good is it if every single time I open a new window my settings are lost?

One of the supposed UI implementors should really run with perspectives opening 
in their own window so you can see the problems like this one.
They are not lost. When you open a new search view, the settings should be the
same as when you last changed them (i.e. if you change a search result view from
flat to tree, the next search result view will open with the same settings). If
that is not what's happening, please provide a scenario. 
1. Set your preferences so that new perspectives open in their own window AND 
hierarchy views open as perspectives.

2. Now open a hierarchy on a type & do a search, then change some settings in 
the search view like sort order.

3. Close the window and do it again.
yes, sorting is not preserved. Flat/Hierarchical is, though.
so why are some options remembered but not others?

That makes no sense to me at all. I should only have to change a setting once.
It's a bug that sorting is lost. The rest is the same behaviour as the package
explorer.
