1. Configure your workspace to open a type hierarchy in its own perspective in 
a new window. Then open a new hierarchy perspective on any type.

2. Do a search for references on one of its methods & configure the sort order 
to be Parent name.

3. Close the hierarchy perspective & reopen a new one, then perform the search 
again.

4. Go back to the main Java perspective & the search view does not include type 
names... it just has the method names.

Thomas, can you please investigate.
It seems the sort order is being reset.
Nope, the sort order is ok, but a new JavaSearchResultsLabelProvider is created
without setting the proper display flags. 

Immediate fix is attached, but this deserves more attention (understand the flow).

patch agains org.eclipse.jdt.ui project
The patch was on the right track: don't create a new label provider if there's
already one. However this code should be down in the Search infrastructure.

Fixed SearchResultViewer to keep its label provider instead of using a new one.
