1) perform a search with more than one match
->the first match is selected
2) press next
->the next match is selected and opened in the editor.

The old search view behaviour was different. The first next press will open 
the currently selected match.

For users used to the old search view this is annoying since you can no longer 
open all matches by just pressing next.
