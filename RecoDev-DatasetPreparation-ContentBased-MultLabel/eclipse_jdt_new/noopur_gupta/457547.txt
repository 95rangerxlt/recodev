When I use quick fix both in a magic number or in a string the following options appear in the popup:

 Extract to local variable (replace all ocurrences)
 Extract to local variable
 Extract to local constant

When a string is being selected, both the first and the third option replace all the ocurrences of the string.

But when a number is being selected, it only replaces the selected occurrence selecting any of those options.

I found a workaround: using the shortcut Ctrl+T, A, then checking "replace all the occurrences".

This is a bug with all literals as ExtractTempRefactoring#checkInitialConditions sets fReplaceAllOccurrences to false for literals (to set the initial state of the check box in Extract Local Variable wizard).

For the quick assist "Extract to local variable (replace all ocurrences)", fReplaceAllOccurrences should be set to true.
