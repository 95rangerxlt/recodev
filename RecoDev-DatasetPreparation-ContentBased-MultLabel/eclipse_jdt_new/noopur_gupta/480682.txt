Consider the following code:

---------------------------------------------
public class Test extends Base {

}

abstract class Base implements I {
    @Override
    public final void method1() {}
}

interface I {
    void method1();
    void method2();
}
---------------------------------------------

Let's click Alt-Shift-S, V (Override / Implement Methods) inside of the Test class. The popup offers to implement both method1() and method2() via the interface I, even if method1() cannot be further overridden in the context of Test.

Notice how the class Base doesn't appear in the results, which is correct, as it doesn't contain any methods that can be overridden.

Eclipse should not offer overriding inherited methods from interfaces, which are made final somewhere in the super class chain.

The quick fix 'Add unimplemented methods' works correctly by adding only #method2. The refactoring should also not show #method1.

This was caused after the fix for bug 460521. 
Fixed in master and added test cases for this bug and the interface case from bug 460521.
