Given the following code:

static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
	try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
		return br.readLine();
	}
}

When using Extract Method on the body of the method, the required parameter "path" is not passed to the extracted method:


static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
	return readLine();
}

private static String readLine() throws IOException, FileNotFoundException {
	try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
		return br.readLine();
	}
}

Attached the fix and test. All existing tests are green with the fix.
Markus, please review.
Hmm, did you realize that all your changes put the processing of the "resources" property *after* the processing of the "body" property, although the "resources" precede "body" in the AST as well as in the order of execution?

When I fixed the order, the new ExtractMethodTests17#test8() failed again. That's because TryFlowInfo#mergeTry(FlowInfo, FlowContext) just calls

	assign(info);

and thereby drops the flow info of preceding resource nodes. When I called

	mergeSequential(info, context);

instead, then all tests were green again.

Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with a code snippet for which the proper processing order actually matters. But for the sake of clarity, I committed the correct order: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=2ec9b22523223bf401d505a2b640b76ece079822
