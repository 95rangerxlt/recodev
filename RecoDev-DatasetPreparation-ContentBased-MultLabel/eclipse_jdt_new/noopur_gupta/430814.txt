Given this:


public class Main {

	private static interface Foo {
		default void hello() {
			System.out.println("Hello");
		}
	}

	private static interface Bar extends Foo {
	}

}


Do the following:

1. Put the cursor in the body of Bar
2. Type "hello" and invoke content assist
3. Select "Override method in 'Foo'"


Expected: The following is generated:

		@Override
		public default void hello() {
		}

Actual: The following is generated:

		@Override public default void hello();

Which has the following error:

  This method requires a body instead of a semicolon


See also bug 430802 for the case where Bar is a class that implements Foo.
