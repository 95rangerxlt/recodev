Update JDT T&T document with relevant items from Kepler N&N documents.

Update JDT T&T document with relevant items from Kepler N&N documents.
The following N&N items can be added to T&T document:

New Entries:
1. Remove type arguments after content assist
2. Use ';' key to insert method invocation

Add to existing entry:
1. Javadoc view resolves enclosing method call and keeps last target
2. Support for package Javadoc in Javadoc hover and view

Dani/Markus, please have a look and let me know if any other item has to be added or if any of the above is not required to be added to T&T.
Sounds good, please proceed as suggested.

As discussed with Dani, did not add these as 1st one in not very important and 2nd one is already implied with the existing statement in T&T.
Restored formatting of keys and code snippets from original entry in N&N: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=a752246fdc1823cdee405aff0a45376c6f173a34
