Pass to UI for comment
It is a compile-time error if an abstract method declared in an interface is strictfp or native or synchronized. Hence the quick fix has to be modified to take care of these cases too.

Also It is a compile-time error if a method declared in an interface is declared final. We can go over the different quick fix provided for the interface methods to handle the above cases.

Patch

The patch contains fixes and tests for the following:

- Fixed "Remove method body" quick fix to remove invalid modifiers also for abstract methods in both interfaces and classes.

- Fixed "Remove invalid modifiers" quick fix to remove 'strictfp' also for abstract interface methods.

- Removed unnecessary code involving ASTRewrite from the fix of bug 414084, since ModifierChangeCorrectionProposal is already being used there.

Markus, please have a look.
