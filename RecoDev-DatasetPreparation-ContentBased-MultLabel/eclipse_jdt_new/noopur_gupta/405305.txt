Investigate what we have to do for LambdaExpressions in the UI.

Possible pain points:

- code that traverses the parent chain to find the enclosing scope (e.g. to find visibility of variables, possible target position for Extract Local Variable or Extract Method)

- type of lambda expression is inferred from context (e.g. extracting a lambda expression into a local variable may need special handling to get the right type; compare to MethodInvocation.isResolvedTypeInferredFromExpectedType())

- problems with lambda parameters without a declared type

- ...

Closing this as the status will be updated individually in the remaining bugs.
