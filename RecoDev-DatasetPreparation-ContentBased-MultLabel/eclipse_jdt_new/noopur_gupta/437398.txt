Follow-up to bug 391389. There are other scenarios where Eclipse asks for a new file name, and those should behave the same as the Rename dialog.

E.g. when you copy/paste a file in the Package Explorer, the dialog should also pre-select the file name without the extension.

Please think about other cases where should add this as well for consistency. I didn't find anything right away, but maybe you do.
I couldn't find any place other than comment #0 where file name is pre-filled with extension.
For copy/paste, the selection of the text to change is done from org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.InputDialog class.
The selectAll() call on the text field is hardcoded on this dialog.

So it seems an important refactoring would be needed to fix this one (for instance define a specific wizard, as done with RenameResourceWizard).
No sure I want to jump into this now, so unless there is a simple solution, perhaps it is better to assign to somebody else.

We can override InputDialog#createButtonsForButtonBar which calls Text.selectAll() and set the selection as required.

Markus, please have a look at the attached patch.

Yes, that works. But the choice of InputDialog to set/select the text in #createButtonsForButtonBar(Composite) is questionable. We better override #createContents(Composite).

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=e3acadde6670cb99e73585d381037e12bf2af2cd
Applied the same fix to org.eclipse.ui.actions.CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation#getNewNameFor(..): http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/commit/?id=5420fb1b4fc1a364dee872c2f469c8712e2b5e5e

Resurrected bug 200444 to make it follow the behavior from bug 151668.
