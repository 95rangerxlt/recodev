public interface I1 {
	default void foo(int i) { // quick assist on 'i' [1]
		System.out.println(i);
	}
	
	static void bar(int i) {  // quick assist on 'i' [2]
		System.out.println(i);
	}
}

Quick assist 'Assign parameter to new field' on 'i' as shown above, creates the following:

[1]
private int i;
default void foo(int i) {
	this.i = i;
	System.out.println(i);
}

[2]
private static int i;
static void bar(int i) {
	I1.i = i;
	System.out.println(i);
}

The modifier 'private' on newly created fields is incorrect.
Also, fields in an interface are 'final' and cannot be assigned again in the method. 
This leads to compilation errors.

Patch + Tests

The field in an interface has to be initialized with some value, here that value depends on the caller of the method and is unknown.
Also, the field would be final so it cannot be used for assignment in the method.

Hence, disabled this quick assist for interface types.

Manju, please review.
The fix done in QuickAssistProcessor looks fine.

The new test class 'AssistQuickFixTest18' is missing the copyright info as well as the Java 8 header info.

@since 3.9 BETA_JAVA8 tag missing in the Javadoc of the new methods added in JavaProjectHelper.

The Java 8 test setup looks fine, but it would be good if Markus can have a look at the test setup as this will be the test environment we will be using for Java 8 work .

I am giving a review+ for the patch under the trust that the copyright and @since tag information will be added before releasing the patch :)
(In reply to comment #2)
Thanks for the review Manju. Added copyright and Java8 header for 'AssistQuickFixTest18'. Also, added @since for new methods in JavaProjectHelper.
