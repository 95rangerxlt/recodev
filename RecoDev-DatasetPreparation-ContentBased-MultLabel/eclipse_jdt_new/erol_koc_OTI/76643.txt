To configure the line wrapping settings it is currently necessary to do that 
separatly for each setting. It would be nice if this could be done once for 
all or for a subset.
The idea would be to allow multiple selection of the tree (including parent 
nodes) and allow to use the configuration controls on the bottom.
If the selected entries have non-compatible settings, the control should take 
the most chosen but show the conflict shomehow (e.g. by an extra label or 
symbol or different background color)

It is ok to not show a preview when multiple nodes are selected (or merge as 
done on the 'white space' page
