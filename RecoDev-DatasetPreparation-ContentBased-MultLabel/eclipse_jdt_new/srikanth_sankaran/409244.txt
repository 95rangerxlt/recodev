Andy, thanks for following up.
I have a partial implementation - the simple cases work but generic casts are the problem. Before I can finish it I'm waiting on confirmation of a spec query on jsr308-discuss:

Andy, I would be happy with a solution that simply always emits a runtime
cast if the cast carries an annotation. I do not believe it is a big deal
to emit a cast in this situations. We can always raise a follow up defect to
implement the fuller solution and tackle it at leisure.

What do you think ?
Yes, I was coming to the same conclusion.

Great, in that case do you want to propose a patch - org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.CastExpression.tagAsNeedCheckCast() should
be useful it looks like.

If you are very busy this week otherwise, I can wrap this up. I am keen to 
drive down the open issues count for 308.

Thanks for getting to this Srikanth, sorry I didn't manage to find the time.
