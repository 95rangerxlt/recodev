This ER will be used to implement/track code generation for lambda
expressions that refer to effectively final variables or fields of
its enclosing class.
While resolving bug 405067, I had to disable 9 tests that require code 
generation for instance and outer locals capture which is not yet in 
place via:

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=92dfd6c989831ab263c5667f92428e6c9943c027

These will have to be reenabled after the present bug is fixed.
I'll split this bug into two - retaining the present one for support of
enclosing locals capture opening a fresh one, Bug 406319.

Patch will follow shortly.
Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=07061c09a4baa11ac0a53e425e478493f3662bd4
