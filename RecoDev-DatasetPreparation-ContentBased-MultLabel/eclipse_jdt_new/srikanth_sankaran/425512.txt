We should compile

    (int [] & Serializable) new int [0];

javac doesn't, but that is a bug.

Fix and tests here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=718192aaf9b0c9c98eabd9c303872394bcd107d2
V0.8 of the 335 spec has actually disallowed arrays in intersection casts
explicitly.

CastExpression:
'(' PrimitiveType ')' UnaryExpression
'(' ReferenceType ')' UnaryExpressionNotPlusMinus ReferenceCastOperand
'(' ClassOrInterfaceType AdditionalBoundList ')' ReferenceCastOperand

is the new grammar. Accordingly we should back out this fix.
