If one of the new tokens '->' or '::' is misplaced the compiler currently
reports
  Syntax error on token "ARROW", ...
  Syntax error on token "COLON_COLON", ...

For all other tokens it shows the token verbatim, not by its name.
I found that this is caused by failure to list these tokens in the $names
section of the grammar (at the very bottom). Adding these lines fixes the issue:

ARROW ::= '->'
COLON_COLON ::= '::'
