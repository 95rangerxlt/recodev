BETA_JAVA8: 

This is spawned by splitting Bug 405068. I'll retain that bug for capture
of locals from enclosing context and use the present one for enclosing instance
capture as these two topics are unconnected and involve altogether different
implementation concerns.

When this is resolved, we should also reenable the tests disabled via:
eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=92dfd6c989831ab263c5667f92428e6c9943c027

Test and fix released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=1b53a525120894192853120c7678edb264d25490

All the tests mentioned in comment#0 as being disabled are
enabled back now.

I'll follow up with some more tests, but this bug is essentially
fixed and ready to be resolved.
