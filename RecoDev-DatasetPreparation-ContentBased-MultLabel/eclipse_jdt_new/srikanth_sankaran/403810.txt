BETA_JAVA8:

At the moment, we have been tagging Java 8 API items (mostly IProblems)
with "@since 3.9"

This needs to be adjusted to be "@since 3.9 BETA_JAVA8"

We don't want to use 3.9.1 since we want to be able to distinguish between
what gets added in 3.9.1 in normal course and what got expressly added for
Java 8 support.

Shankha, Thanks for following up.
As I had to make an addition to IProblem I added the BETA_JAVA8 token to
all constants in this file which are not also in master.
See commit 86ee968d8acf90a0a75c72085f72a3416b02186d (bug 404649).

I had replaced all the 3.9 tags. I should have replaced only the ones for BETA_JAVA8. I will correct the patch a upload a new one.

Thanks Shankha, I have released the changes excluding CompletionContext - the API TL_CONSTRUCTOR_START was added as part of Kepler work.
