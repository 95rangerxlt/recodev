Patch for the fix
Here are the review comments:

1. I would remove the test testBug405250a and the associated code in
RecoveredUnit. That test is testing a totally broken scenario and I am
comfortable if we suggest some proposals that are out of line in that
scenario. Adding code to prevent illegitimate proposals in broken
scenarios is a project that would not scale well.

2. Please follow project indentation guidelines/prior usage. Space after
while and if is needed for example.

3. Is K_IMPORT_DELIMITER better named K_INSIDE_IMPORT_STATEMENT ? (like
K_INSIDE_THROW_STATEMENT ? 

4. isInImportSpecification - is it better named isInImportStatement ?

5. I don't think consumeSingleTypeImportDeclarationName is the best place
to pop K_IMPORT_DELIMITER/K_INSIDE_IMPORT_STATEMENT - there are 4 types of
import statement and only one is covered by consumeSingleTypeImportDeclarationName.
