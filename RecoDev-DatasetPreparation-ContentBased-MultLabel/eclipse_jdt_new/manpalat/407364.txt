Test case to reproduce the issue

Incorrect ASTRewrite transformation for Annotated Qualified Type 
Ref Attached test case:

Expected output is Outer.Inner for Outer.@Marker Inner after ASTRewrite, but the actual output is Inner.

Proposed Patch

 - Corrected a similar omission in PackageQualifiedType as well.
Jay and Markus, I believe this is the last open item to close bug 398940.
Jay, please review so Markus can have a final glance through the fix and
we can declare done on 308 DOM/AST and ASTRewrite work.
Patch looks good. Interestingly, testPackageQualifiedTypeAnnotations() was failing too, without the patch, although it's an existing test. Was it always like that?

Please refer to comment 2 - there was an omission in PQT and this was corrected in the patch as discussed. The fully qualified name of the type was omitted in the expected result which caused the PQT test to pass earlier - was modified now to reflect the issue, and subsequently corrected - did not raise a new bug for PQT but just mentioned in the comment 2 of this bug.

Thanks for explaining. I probably didn't look close enough and thought the test was failing without the fix. But of course, that's not the case.

Thanks Jay for the review.

Markus: Any comments?
Looks OK, but:

- in visit(QualifiedType), the 'try' statement should be moved inside the
'if (node.getAST().apiLevel() >= AST.JLS8)' block

- in visit(PackageQualifiedType), the AST.JLS8 check should be removed (redundant, since a PackageQualifiedType cannot exist in earlier ASTs)

Good to go with these changes.
