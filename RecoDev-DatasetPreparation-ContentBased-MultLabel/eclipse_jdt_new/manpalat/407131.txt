Proposed Patch

This patch addresses the issue  of additional character in new for source position - mentioned in bug 399794 comment 7 (repeated as the issue mentioned in  bug 384667 comment 7)

Srikanth: Could you please take a quick glance at this single character change in Parser (consequently the affected test cases also have output changes - by a char).

Markus: The above patch has only the required changes for this bug in ASTRAnalyzer which needs changes - reordering of existing functions - to maintain the order. This can be done once the review of the above patch is done.

I reviewed the change to Parser.java - it looks good, Thanks.
Just one comment:

1. ASTRewriteFlattener - visitReferenceTypeArguments() results in two calls to getChildList, which can be avoided by directly calling the approprriate visitList that takes 'lead' and 'post' as parameters. And the method visitReferenceTypeArguments itself can be avoided.
