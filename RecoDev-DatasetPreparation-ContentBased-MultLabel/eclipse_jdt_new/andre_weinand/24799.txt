Using 1009, when I synchronize with the cvs server and I compare my outgoing
changes with the repository contents, I get too many times "Java Structure
Compare (Can't Compare Structures)". This didn't happen in the past.
I don't know what changed, but this is frustrating and make the whole
synchronization process very difficult to use. It is not always the same files
which are failing. I didn't get anything in a .log file.

Forwarding to JDT since the problem is in the Java Structure Compare
My guess that this comes from different line delimiters used.

Different line delimiters should not let the structure compare fail.
Since I didn't touch the code since 2.0, the parser must have changed.
Will investigate.
I see the same problem with 

Build 2001015
1. Checkout TextViewer (I took revision 1.5) (org.eclipse.jface.text)
2. In line 84 change value of TRACE_ERRORS from "false" to "true"
3. Synchronize with repository
==> Can't Compare Structures is displayed

Note: also happens when comparing with latest or local history

Increased severity to critical: couldn't compare 2 out of 6 files.


Since 2.0 the parser reports problems that are not syntax related, e.g. tasks like "todo" 
etc. Changed Java structure compare so that only syntax errors abort the parsing.
Fix released on 20021016.
