1. compare a package with patch
2. select clipboard in 'Select Patch' 
3. hit 'next'
the dialog has a bogus title (see bug 11817)

and it says:
No diffs found in

in where?

it's an error dialog - these should be shown only if something really bad 
happened. this does not qualify as such situation i think
