3.1 M3

I wrote tests that ensure plug-ins like Search and Compare (currently commented
out) aren't loaded when
opening a Java editor.

The one for Compare fails because of bug 78315 and because when the Java editor
creates its actions it calls new LocalHistoryActionGroup(...) which loads the
Compare plug-in.

Test Case:
0. ensure bug 78315 has been fixed or comment out the code in TeamUIPlugin
1. add startup() method to CompareUIPlugin
2. put a breakpoint there

Compare plug-in gets loaded by LocalHistoryActionGroup

performance

fixed #78317
