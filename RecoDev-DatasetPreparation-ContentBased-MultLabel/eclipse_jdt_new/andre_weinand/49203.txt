Version 3.0.m6.
When I open the Open Type dialog (Ctrl-Shift-T) from a Java Editor, sometimes
(like now, several minutes) it takes a loooong time to open and dispays a
"Progress Information" dialog w/ the message "Operation in progress..." but does
not actually give me progress information. 

It would be much nicer to have a progress bar with whatever data is being cooked
up. I can only imagine that ... what? the types are being indexed? Dunno ;-)

Andre, can you please comment. This happens when the cache is filled in the 
background and open type has to wait until this is finished.
Has been fixed by tracking progress in background, and synching up a foreground progress monitor if 
necessary. 


Better progress info when preparing to open Open Type dialog
