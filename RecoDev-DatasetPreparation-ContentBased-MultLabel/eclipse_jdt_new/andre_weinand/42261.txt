I removed 3.0m2 and installed 3.0m3 using the same workspace as I was using 
with 3.0m2. Now I get some very small icons in the Run and Debug launch 
configuration dialogs and a bunch of errors in my error log. Some of the 
errors have to do with plugins that I had installed in 3.0m2 that I don't have 
installed in 3.0m3. I've exited and restarted the workbench several times but 
the problems won't go away. I'll attach a screenshot and the most recent log 
file.

By the way, the launch conguration dialog for External commands looks 
perfectly normal.

Screen shot showing the tiny icons

Also note the %tomcatLaunchConfigurationTypeName configuration and the red
icons. All I installed was the 3.0m3 sdk and the 3.0m3 examples packages.

Error log file from my last 3.0m3 session.

I didn't get any error dialogs but after seeing the strange icons I looked in
the error log and sure enough there were a bunch of errors there.
Ed, I believe that the small icons are a result of the missing error icon for 
the tomcat launch configuration type. I seem to remember that the first icon in 
the tree sets the dimensions.
That was it; the org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.javafamily_3.0.0 plugin that is 
part of the examples package is missing its icons directory. Plugin.properties 
is missing as well. Probably a problem in their build.properties.
The build.properties file for org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.javafamily requires 
entries for the bin.include for the icons directory and the plugin.properties.
fixed for N20030902
Andr√©, please note that whenever you change the JARs name in the
build.properties file you have to update the plugin.xml (see bug 42545).
