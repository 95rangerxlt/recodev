Andre, the cache is build with a delay ?
Yes, it's started after 10 seconds.
To be exact the delay starts after the Java plugin has been started.
May be we should start it after the workbench is up and precesses events (but 
I don't know if this is possible). Otherwise we could really slow down startup 
performace if somethings gets loaded after JDT/UI.
fixed for N20030822.
Now the thread starts 4 seconds after the event loop has started.
Just out of curiosity: how do you find out that the event queue has started.
lemme guess: you put something to the event queue as synch/asych exec?
