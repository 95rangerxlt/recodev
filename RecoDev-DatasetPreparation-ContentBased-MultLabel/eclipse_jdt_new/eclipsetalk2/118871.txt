The similar elements matcher could also handle the usual english plurals
"" -> "s" and "y" -> "ies".

class Item { // rename to Thing 
    Item[] items; //not found, should rename to things
    Item[] item; //ok
}

The non plus ultra would be support for conversions like this:

class Handy { // rename to MobilePhone
    java.util.Collection<Handy> handies; //-> mobilePhones
    Handy[] handy; //-> mobilePhone
}
