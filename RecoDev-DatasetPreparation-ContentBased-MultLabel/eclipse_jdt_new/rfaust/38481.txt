	int foo;

this is even more brutal here:
public class Ad {
	
	void f(){}
	
	int foo;	
	int foo1;
	int foo2;	
        class Inner{
           //lotsa code here
        }
}

it adds the getter after the inner class
This seems to be a function of calling SourceType.createMethod(). 
Recommendations?
Isn't createMethod inserting the new method _before_ the given sibling?
So if you pass 'int foo;' as sibling it should work. My guess was that the code
passes the next _method_, but not the next _member_.

if not we have to file anbug against jcore.
Your guess is correct. Will modify the code so that the sibling is the next 
member, not the next method.

proposed fix.

There may be a better way to do this, but here's a patch.
