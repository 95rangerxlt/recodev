1. Use the 'create constructor from fields' action: set 'Insert as first'
2. Now use the create delegate method wizard and set 'Insert as last'
3. Open the  'create constructor from fields' wizard again. The setting is
'Insert as last'.
It should be the same as set the last time I used the 'create constructor from
fields' wizard.
To store the settings globally is not that helpful: Constructors are typically
inserted at the top, while new methods at the bottom.

This was originally a design feature. It can be changed to work on a per 
action basis.
got implemented sometimes for 3.0




Source generation wizards: Settings should be saved per wizard
