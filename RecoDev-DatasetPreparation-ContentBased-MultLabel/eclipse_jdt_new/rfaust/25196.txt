The "Test case" and "Test class" fields should be reversed in the JUnit 
TestCase wizard since when text is entered in the "Test class" field it sets 
the "Test case" field automatically, even when it is not empty.

By reversing these fields the user will simply enter the Test class first and 
the Test case name will be filled in correctly.

Regardless of the order of these fields, the "Test case" field should ONLY be 
automatically set if it is EMPTY.  Bashing user entered text is not a good idea.

the order of the fields is consistent with the new class wizard, the class 
name/test name appear at the top.

Agreed that the Test Case contents should be guarded from being lost. Adjusted 
bug title.

Removes auto updating of "test case" field

Removed the auto-updating of the "test case" field. The "test case" field
defaults to the "test class" field plus the suffix "Test". NOTE: This patch
also contains fix for Bug 36336.
I was initially very confused by this smart guide. After I read through the 
help on this subject, I finally understood what the fields meant. I think my 
confusion came for two reasons:
1. I really did not understand what is meant by the label "Test class". Once I 
read the help, I realized it really meant "the name of the class that your test 
will be testing".
2. The fact that the Test class field lies between the Test case and its 
superclass also confused me. So much so, that I originally thought that 
the "Test class" field was where I should type in "SchmedleyTestCase".
So I suggest 2 very minor changes that would mitigate the confusion of fellow 
cavemen who will use this wizard in the future:
1. Change the label from "Test class" to "Class being tested" or "Tested 
class". The example in the help is quite condemning: String is certainly not a 
test class, but it is the class being tested. (You might also consider making 
it clearer that this field is optional. So optional, in fact, that I so far 
have never used it!)
2. Put the "Class being tested" field first, before the "Test case" field. That 
way it is clear whose superclass the "Superclass" field corresponds to. And it 
does not violate the class/superclass order precedent cited by Erich.
Hope this helps...
:-P
I released the patch.
I agree with Paul, I also think that the wizard is confusing. I think we should
move the Test class field to the bottom of the dialog or even to the next page.  
a line from the patch didn't get added I think.
Here's what the constructor for NewTestCaseCreationWizard should be:

	public NewTestCaseCreationWizard() {
		super();
		setWindowTitle(WizardMessages.getString
("Wizard.title.new.testcase")); //$NON-NLS-1$
		initDialogSettings();
	}

proposed fix.

Moved "test case" up above "test class" and renamed it to "Class to test."
Added a longer description which mentions that the "Class to test" field is
optional. Changed name of of "test class" to "Name" which is now right above
Superclass field. This seems to be more inline with the other type constructors
(class, interface).
Added a "." (period) to the description on page 2.
