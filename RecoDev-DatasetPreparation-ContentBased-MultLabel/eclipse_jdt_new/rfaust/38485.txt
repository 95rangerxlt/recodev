class A extedns ArrayList{

after adding all 3 constructors, the text selection is set to something in the 
middle of a comment not, to to something meaningful
IMO the selection should stay. 
So you want the current text highlight to be preserved no matter what it is? 
Even if it spans two methods and the constructors are inserted b/t the two 
methods?
line 261 of AddUnimplementedConstructorsAction.java makes a call to

EditorUtility.revealInEditor(editor, res[0]);

If there's a breakpt in the debugger at this call, then the highlight works as 
it should for the test case. If there's no breakpt, then the highlight is 
messed up as suggested by the bug report. 
you have to call compilationUnit.reconcile to make sure that all node ranges are
updated.

			if (cunit.isWorkingCopy()) {
				synchronized (cunit) {
					cunit.reconcile();
				}
			}

Trivial fix using previous suggestion.
