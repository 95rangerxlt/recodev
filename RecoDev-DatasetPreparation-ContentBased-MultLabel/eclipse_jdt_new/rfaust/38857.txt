It would be nice to have a template to generate something similar to what Emcas
JDEE does, for example.
For
  private String text = null;

it will generate the following:

  /**
   * Get the value of text.
   * @return value of text.
   */
  public String getText() {
    return text;
  }
  
  /**
   * Set the value of text.
   * @param text value to assign to text.
   */
  public void setText(String text) {
    this.text = text;
  }
Some organizations might have coding standards enforced so the Eclipse's
alternative for setter:
  public void setText(String string) {
    text = string;
  }
would not be acceptable.

Default javadoc might be helpful too. I think that having a template would meet
everybody's style requerements.

Martin, this got addressed ?
no, we don't have comment templates for getter/setter (only body templates), but
I think we could/should do this.

Note that the 'this.' problem was also addressed already.
Fixed in 3.0 M1.
