should be fixed.  I left the AllJdtCoreTests class in CVS in the event that 
someone needs to change the ordering of the jdt core tests around in the 
future.  I thought this was a convenient place to do it. 


fixed now. 


Delete AllJdtCoreTests in APT test project



Removed our apt-specific ordering of the jdt-tests, since that is no longer necessary.  This should resolve bugzilla 101144, although I left the "AllJdtCoreTests" class in CVS since we may at some point need to change the ordering around (it was never clear why this was necessary, but was helpful in the past). 

- reordered tests so that the model tests run first.  If not, the model tests fail.  This is being tracked by Bugzilla 101144.
