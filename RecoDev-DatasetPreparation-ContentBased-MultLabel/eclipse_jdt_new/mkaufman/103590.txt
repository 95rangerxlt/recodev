1. Install the JDBCControlSample project from the sandbox (see instructions in
//depot/dev/sandbox/eclipse-jdt/BeehivePetstoreProject/beehive_petstore_demo_setup.txt).

2. Clean and build the project.

3. See build errors in problem pane: 
Severity	Description	Resource	In Folder	Location	Creation Time
2	Project JDBCControlSample is missing required source folder:
'__generated_src'	JDBCControlSample			July 12, 2005 2:52:48 PM

Severity	Description	Resource	In Folder	Location	Creation Time
2	The project cannot be built until build path errors are resolved
JDBCControlSample			July 12, 2005 2:52:52 PM


4. Try to add a new source folder with that name in the project. Get error
message in New Source Folder dialog: " The folder is already a source folder."

5. Add the directory to the project root in windows Explorer. Refresh project in
 Package Explorer.

6. Clean and build again. Problem goes away.

I believe that this has to do with having an entry in the .classpath file for
the project, which does not already exist on disk. This will be a problem for
anyone who downloads a checked-in project from a source control system with a
generated directory already defined in it.

This bug manifested in a Daybreak build from 7/7/2005.

Sent mail to Philipe, Jerome, Dirk & Kent Johnson on this issue.  We need to 
find some way for our APTPlugin to get called when there's a fatal build 
error, and we can then try to fix this.  Probably we'll want to update the 
ICompilationParticipant with a handleBuildError() method or something.


The current suggestion from Phillipe is to use an "APT nature".  In this 
nature's configure() call, we can check to see if the apt-config specifies a 
generated_src dir and the generated_src dir is on the classpath but doesn't 
exist on disk.  At this point, we will create the generated src dir. 

We will need to account for a default generated_src dir (this may come out of 
the config UI as an empty string).

I'm investigating this approach.  The biggest thing that isn't clear to me is 
how/when we will be able to add the APT nature as a project.



Using a nature won't work.  A nature's configure() method is only called on 
project creation.  We need this called whenever a project is opened.  
Created attachment 25650
patch for APT branch of o.e.jdt.core


This patch is changes that allow the JavaBuilder to call any
ICompilationParticipants and notify them of build classpath errors.
Created attachment 25651
changes to o.e.jdt.apt.core 


Changes to o.e.jdt.apt.core to use the new ICompilationParticipant APIs that
notify the compilation particiants of the build classpath error.

There are two patches attached here.  Once the org.eclipse.jdt.core patch is 
applied on the APT branch, the org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core patch can be applied.  
These two should fix this problem. 

Created attachment 25652
project for repro-ing problem


This simple project will repro the bug.

Simple repro steps: 

1.  unzip project .zip file attached to this bug
2.  import into workspace.  You should see the build error described in this 
bug.  
3.  After the __generated_src folder has been added, to see the problem again 
you will need to 
   a) remove the project from your workspace
   b) delete the __generated_src from the file system
   c) import teh project into your workspace



should be fixed.
