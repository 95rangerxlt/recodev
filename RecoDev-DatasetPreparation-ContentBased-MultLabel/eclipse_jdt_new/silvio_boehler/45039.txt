Good, thanks.

Silvio Boehler is now working on the new code formatter preference page.

Olivier, we came across the following questions:
- My understanding is that currently you translate old options to the new options
  Where in the code and when is this done?
  How can we disable this (when we have the new preference page)?
- You have prepared maps (e.g. Sun). Have can we access there settings?
1) The convertion is done in the DefaultCodeFormatterOptions class. See line 1180.
2) In the same class, please see getSunSetttings(). I will keep it there and we
need to be consistent between the UI and this method. If you change any of these
settings, let me know.
The alignment management can still change. We need to find a way to express
alignment mode independantly the implementation names.

In general, we have different kinds of options:
1) insertion of spaces
2) insertion of new lines
3) line splitting options.

Where are we on the preference page?
The preference page has been added and can be enabled on the 'Work in progress
page'. Closing this PR, please file separate PRs for any problems/suggestions.
