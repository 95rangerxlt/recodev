I can reproduce it. Investigating for a fix.
Olivier, this is a problem as I currently store all options directly as strings
in XML. Obviously the line delimiters, being special chars, cause problems and
are not correctly recognized.

Could we introduce symbolic constants (strings) for the three possible line
delimiters? Else I need to introduce such a translation on my side, which means
that I can't treat all options uniformly anymore but must make exceptions for
this single setting. 

I propose something like:

DefaultCodeFormatterConstants.LINE_SEPARATOR_WINDOWS= "line_separator_windows"
DefaultCodeFormatterConstants.LINE_SEPARATOR_UNIX= "line_separator_unix"
DefaultCodeFormatterConstants.LINE_SEPARATOR_MAC= "line_separator_mac"

What do you mean?
This is perfectly doable on my side. Then I can use this constant to convert 
internally to the proper delimiter.
In order to be consistent, we should name these constants:

FORMATTER_LINE_SEPARATOR_WINDOWS = JavaCore.PLUGIN_ID 
+ ".formatter.line_separator_windows"
FORMATTER_LINE_SEPARATOR_UNIX = JavaCore.PLUGIN_ID 
+ ".formatter.line_separator_unix"
FORMATTER_LINE_SEPARATOR_MAC = JavaCore.PLUGIN_ID 
+ ".formatter.line_separator_mac"

I am adding them immediately. And I'll send you a patch to update the 
preference page.

Sorry, my mistake. Your naming was perfectly fine.
The decision has been taken to take the line delimiter out of the code formatter
options. The reason is that it is an property of each individual file, whereas
the code formatter options are meant to be applied uniformly to each file.

The line delimiter in a file can currently be set as follows:

* When creating a new file, the default platform line delimiter is taken.

* For an existing file, the line delimiter can be set using 'Convert line
delimiters to...' from the 'Source' menu.

For the code formatter, this implies that it always uses the line delimiter
which is currently set in the file. With the removal of the option, this bug is
therefore considered fixed.
1. what would happen if the file had mixed delimiters?
2. should there be an option in the code formatter to convert delimiters to 
whatever the default for the currant platform is (e.g. a boolean option)?


the new code formatter preferences page doesn't save line delimiter value [formatter]
