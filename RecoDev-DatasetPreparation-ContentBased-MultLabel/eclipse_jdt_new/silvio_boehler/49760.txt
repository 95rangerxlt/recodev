Could we split this option into 

FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_AFTER_OPENING_PAREN_IN_MESSAGE_SEND
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_CLOSING_PAREN_IN_MESSAGE_SEND

This would make it more consistent with the options for method/constructor
declarations. I'm working on a new view for the white space option and this one
falls out the usual scheme, so I'd be happy to have it.

Could we do the same thing here?

FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BETWEEN_BRACKETS_IN_ARRAY_REFERENCE

FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BETWEEN_BRACKETS_IN_ARRAY_TYPE_REFERENCE

(change to AFTER_OPENING_BRACKET / BEFORE_CLOSING_BRACKET)
Forget #2, it's just #1 that matters.
So this would be fine for you:
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_AFTER_OPENING_PAREN_IN_MESSAGE_SEND
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_CLOSING_PAREN_IN_MESSAGE_SEND

I can do it.
Very good! Reassign to me once it is released. The old constant can be 
deprecated for now.
I will also rename
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_AFTER_OPEN_PAREN_IN_PARENTHESIZED_EXPRESSION in
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_AFTER_OPENING_PAREN_IN_PARENTHESIZED_EXPRESSION to be
more consistent with the naming.
Old field has been deprecated.
Fixed and released in JDT/Core.
Regression tests updated.
Added changes to UI:

White Space > Expressions > Method and constructor calls > after/before
opening/closing parenthesis

Using ORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_AFTER_OPEN_PAREN_IN_PARENTHESIZED_EXPRESSION now
instead of FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_AFTER_OPENING_PAREN_IN_PARENTHESIZED_EXPRESSION
