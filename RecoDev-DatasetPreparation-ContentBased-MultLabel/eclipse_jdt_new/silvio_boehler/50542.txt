The code formatter in eclipse 3.0 build 200401210900 has options for the
location of braces for everything except constructors.  I want my ctor brace to
happen on the line after the declaration, but I can't get this to happen -
shouldn't the constructor formatting honor the brace position specified for methods?

This is a missing option in the UI.
Silvio, could you please investigate?
I use FORMATTER_BRACE_POSITION_FOR_CONSTRUCTOR_DECLARATION for constructors and
FORMATTER_BRACE_POSITION_FOR_METHOD_DECLARATION for methods. It would be nice to
get this into tomorrow's integration build.
