Steps to reproduce:
1. See the instructions in code below
2. The resulting code does not compile ("No exception of type Object can be thrown; an exception type must be a subclass of Throwable")

class GeneralizeDeclaredTypeBug3 {
    void f() throws Exception {
        // Invoke "Generalize Declared Type" on "Exception"
        // and select "Object" as new type
        Exception e = new Exception();
        throw e;
    }
}

Fix and Test

I have added the fix and tests. My changes for tests may conflict with another contribution from Bug 395992. Basically in ChangeTypeRefactoringTests I had added additional helper failHelper2 method . This changes are also present in my contribution for Bug 395992. 

This contribution complies with http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CoO.php
In FullConstraintCreator#create(ThrowStatement node), you had ITypeConstraint[] which was converted to ArrayList<ITypeConstraint> and again converted back to ITypeConstraint[] all in 3 consecutive statements. This did not make any sense.

Released the updated patch with : http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=19163c44fe9802b984974e832ff7acdd20f90b50
It was probably copy paste from another snippet and I forgot to correct it.
