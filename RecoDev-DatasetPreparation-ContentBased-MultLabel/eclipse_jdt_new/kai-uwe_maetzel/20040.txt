the plain text editor does not exhibit this mis-behavior

you're left with garbage like
(pressing undo/redo more times produces even more garbage):

public class Dfg  {
    
r.clone();  //<<GARBAGE
    }       //<<GARBAGE

marked as major but i'm not sure
Couldn't reproduce problem using the following steps:

- creating class Test is default package
- adding method clone useing Override method
- using undo/redo/undo works as expected.

Adam can you provide a better test case.

Lowering priority since it is nor reproducable.
seems to be some preference
i'm attaching my pref file

problem only shows up when: spacesForTabs=true

Problem if not fixed: inconsistent state after undo - user confusion and 
potential data loss. Need to investigate in a fix before we can assess the risk.
