F3 build (20020612)

- switch to emacs mode
- open a Java editor
- Alt+/ should work for content assist
- Alt+? should work for parameter info
- they don't work, and the accelerator text for these items in the Edit menu 
appears to be using the default bindings (Ctrl+Space is bound to Set Mark, so 
it doesn't appear for content assist)

- check the plugin.xml for jdt.ui
- they are set properly

Tod tried adding the zh_CN locale-specific bindings for these in the default 
configuration, and says they worked on a Chinese machine, so the action 
definition ids seem to be set properly.

There are two problems here:
1) 
jdt plugin.xml is using 
   scopeId="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.globalScope"
   configurationId="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.emacsAcceleratorConfiguration">
instead of:
   scopeId="org.eclipse.ui.globalScope"
   configurationId="org.eclipse.ui.emacsAcceleratorConfiguration">
Note that there is an extra jdt in both lines.

2) Once the above is fixed the action works fine but the label does not show up 
in the menu option.
Eduardo, why do the labels not appear?
Moved to JDT to fix up the key bindings.
Please move back to Platform UI for the label problem when done.

See bug 20342. I opened as a new report but I think it should be 2.0F4 as this 
one is. I could had just added a comment here.

I am investigating why the label does not appear.
- The label is not shown because "Content Assist" is a RetargetAction and the 
definitionId was not set on it. The defId must be set in the RetargetAction not 
in the handler.

- Another issue here is that all actions from actionSets must specify the 
attribute "definitionId". (Comment/Uncomment are exemples of this problem).

Question regarding Eduardos previous comment:

Why isn't for RetargetActions the action definition id the same as the action 
id? On part activation a retarget action is looking up registered handlers for 
its action id not its action definition id. Handlers are registered for action 
definition ids. Thus, it seems straight forward that action definition id would 
be the same as the action id. Which for all JDT retarget actions would be the 
case anyway.
