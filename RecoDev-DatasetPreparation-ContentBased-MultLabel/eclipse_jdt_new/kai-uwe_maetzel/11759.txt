When the "Highlight current line" preference is enabled for the compilation 
unit editor, the current line highlight lags behind the cursor when Up or Down 
arrows are pressed (i.e. first the cursor is displayed on the next line, then 
the highlight moves to the next line, this is quite noticeable).

This does not seem to occur when the arrow keys are held down and start 
repeating, or PgUp/PgDn are pressed.

fixed: - cheese production <g>
       - line number caching to reduce redraws 
         prevents flickering of line background under motif


Highlight of current line in Java editor is slow
