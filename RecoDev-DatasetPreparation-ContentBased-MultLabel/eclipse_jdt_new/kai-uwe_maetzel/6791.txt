It's certainly only a very minor issue, but I have a few source files,
where the editor seems to have problems determining what is code and
where a comment starts, i.e. it color part of a comment like it were
part of the code.

E.g. I have a line like:
    ...
    public int x; // that's just a variable to demo the effect and
that second quote' makes not sense at all
    ...

where the part between the two quotes ' is shown in blue as if it
where a string-constant.
Another comment contains the word public and that word is displayed in
bold purple, as if it were part of the actual code and not of the
comment.

Funny enough, it's not possible to reliably reproduce this. I just
wanted to copy the relevant pieces into a new example class but there
the color coding is fine. Even copying&pasting the ENTIRE file into a
new one did not recreate the effect, i.e. there the colors and
attributes were fine as well.
