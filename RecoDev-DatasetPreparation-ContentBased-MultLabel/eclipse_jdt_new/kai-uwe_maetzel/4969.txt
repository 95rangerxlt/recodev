After typing a cast:

(int)

automatic code assist is still active.
Does this make any sense?
The list of completions is huge, and it is just like starting with a blank 
slate, so maybe it's best if code assist wasn't still trying to help out in 
this case.

Core code assist issue. The content assist window stays open if there are 
proposals which are provided by the core in this case.
But it is legite to invoke code assist after the closing parenthesis of a cast 
expression, and the completions there are valid ones. 

What would you expect ?
Content assist now filters the computed results itself. Thus, the decribed 
situation will no longer happen. Build 20011218.


Automatic Code Assist needs to be smarter #5
