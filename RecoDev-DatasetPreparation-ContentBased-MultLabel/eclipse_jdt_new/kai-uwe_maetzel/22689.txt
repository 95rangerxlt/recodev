No reproducible case yet. There have been no changes in this area since 2.0 
neither in text nor in jdt text.
after restarting the workspace, I don't have the problem anymore.
-> probably not a regression, just a bug that is hard to detect
No reproducible case yet. Closed. 
This bug has reappeared in plug-in export 20021009-20021015.2.
Please reopen.
JRT.
jennifer, do you have a reproducible case?
Create a new workspace using drop 20021009 with plug-in export: 20021009-
20021015.2.
Import binary plug-ins from runtime workbench (select all). 
Create a new project 'Test' with one package 'org.eclipse.smoke.test' and one 
class 'test'. 'test' has one method that prints hello world. 
Introduce errors into this method and use the error navigator button to jump 
between them. Infact a single error is enough. 
Notic that the button stays 'pushed' after clicking.

JRT. 
I should add that once I shut downa and restarted the workbench the problem 
whent away.

JRT.
Closing as we haven't seen it for a while and we miss a reproducible case.
