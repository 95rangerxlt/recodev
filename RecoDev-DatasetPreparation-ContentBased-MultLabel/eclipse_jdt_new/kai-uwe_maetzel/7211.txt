(Version: Christmas stable build.)

When typing text in the Java source pane, certain Java expressions may cause the
whole Eclipse UI to freeze, the only way out being to kill the VM from another
terminal.

Scenaio:

Having this method:

public static final native void gdk_window_resize(int window, int height);

we try to insert a new "width" argument between window and height.  Place the
cursor in front of "int height" and start typing "int width, ".  The UI
completely freezes after int.

I am using build 20011220-S-20011220 on Windows 2000.

When I edit org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS and add the line (excluding 
double quotes):

"SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLLINES   104" 

in the middle of the field declarations, Eclipse hangs and never comes back.  I 
do not have to try to save to cause this to happen.
Problem fixed in build >= 20020108.
Build 20020109.
