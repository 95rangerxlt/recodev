I am seing some PRs where people think they have code assist bugs, but in fact it is the over help mechanism which gets 
in the way (see 1GDCWED: ITPJCORE:WIN2000 - NPE when opening code assist). 

I think the over-help could be responsible for some slowness in the code assist reaction, because it takes some 
cycles to perform. Is it running inside a low priority thread, and cancel whenever something is happening (like ctrl-space in 
this very case) ?

	I would suggest that the editor hover is disabled while the code assist is shown
	There is the code assist hover help instead

EG (5/9/2001 12:10:15 PM)
	I agree that that hovering should be disabled when code assist is active.
	The hover will show up below code assist anyway and isn't readable.
	Hover can delay code assist in the following situaiton:
	1) user types typeName.f
	2) moves the cursor over type Name
	3) waits > 0.6 seconds so that the hover triggers
	4) presses code assist
	We can make the hover less automatic, e.g., it triggers only
	when it is over a selected word.
	This means the user has to double click before seeing the hover.
	->code assist has to wait until the hover is computed.
	This behaviour should be put in as a preference since I can argue
	that when reading code I want to see hovers as I move the mouse.
