From Eclipse Corner:  Feature request - line numbers in editor
	First of all - what a great tool you all have made. But I miss one 
	feature and that is line number in the editor. I know that I can jump to 
	a given line by using [ctrl]+l but I still think that line number would 
	be great or am I missing something??

	Additional post:
	Concur.  Just a little line,col label somewhere near the bottom.
	Alternatively, and actually preferrably, be able to toggle line numbers
	on/off in a 'prefix' area of the text widget itself.  (Anyone remember XEDIT
	:-).  I often deal with non-Java stuff, and someone or other complains about
	errors on line XXX ...

	One more post:
	Presumably this will be optional.  I (and I imagine most current/former 
	VAJ users) have no need or desire to see the line numbers.

NOTES:

The latest build appears to still not have this feature/defect addressed. What 
is the status of integration for this feature/defect? 
This is an uncommitted work item for 2.0. If there is time it will be added.
Java editor supports line numbers in build 20020508. Functionality is part of 
JFace Text, AbstractTextEditor subclasses can be configured to use it.
How exactly is this defect/feature request resolved?

Looking at build 20020508_1022 I do notice that there is a row/col label on the 
bottom of the Java perspective that tracks the current row and col in the Java 
editor. The original defect comment was a request for the row/col label and a 
method to toggle the line number on/off similar to the manner the Eclipse XML 
editor currently supports. 

Is the toggle of line numbers similar to the XML editor supposed to be present 
or only a row/col label?
In order to turn line numbering on in the editor follow the steps below: 

Window>Preferences>Java>Editor
Check "Show line numbers".
