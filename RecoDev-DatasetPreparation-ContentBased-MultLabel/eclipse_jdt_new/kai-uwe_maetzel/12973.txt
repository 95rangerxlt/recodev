The find change action should appear in the same group after Find/Replace
from Nick:

I have added a FIND_EXT group name to IWorkbenchActionConstants, and insert it 
after the Find action in the Edit menu, but before the separator.
This follows the current style of defining groups for extension rather than 
overall groups including the workbench actions (e.g. GROUP_FIND, or EDIT_FIND).
I don't feel strongly about this style, though, so if you find it problematic 
let me know.

verified that this one is fixed


Find actions are scattered in the Edit menu
