Build 204 - Windows XP

Usability:
  I usually work with "Show source of selected element only" active. When I 
have more than one java file open, clicking on a file puts the focus on the 
package name. Not sure if it can be solved by the java editor but it would be 
much more useful if the focus could go to the java class.
  It would be a great plus to have the focus going back to the last selected 
element of that file. So that it would go back to the last method I was 
editing.

Not sure how/why but it seems to be working now (on the same machine and 
build).
fixed. bug wasn't in the Java editor.


When "Show source of selected element only" is active we should focus the class file and not the package name
