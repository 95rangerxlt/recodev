If you place you cursor after the first argument ('args') and type a comma, 
code assist will automatically appear.  It will offer one candidate: 'Bar'.

#1 - this is a very poor list of candidates.  There are very many other 
possibilities.

#2 - this is very annoying.  The typical usage pattern is to 
type 'comma' 'space'.  If you pause for just a moment after the 'comma' code 
assist will appear and then the 'space' will select the first item.

I've just discovered that there's an option to specify the auto code assist 
triggers.  I would suggest that the default value of this option be changed to 
exclude comma.

Done.


Auto code assist should be disabled in method parameter declaration
