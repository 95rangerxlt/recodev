Build 20011115

If inside the editor I have the cursor next to a bracket, then its matching one 
is highlighted - fine.

Now go to the preference menu, and disable the bracket highlighting, go back to
the editor and notice that the matching bracket is still highlighted, when it 
should have been cleared when disabling the feature.
