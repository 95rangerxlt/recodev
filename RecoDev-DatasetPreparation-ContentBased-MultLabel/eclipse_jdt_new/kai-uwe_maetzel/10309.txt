Build 20020214

- create a X.java file
- build
- it creates a X.class file
- copy it to the same folder
- it gets called "Copy of X.class"
- try to open it
- you get an error dialog: "Invalid resource type for Invalid input for Class 
File Viewer"
- it looks like it's actually trying to compose two error messages here (it's 
not english)
