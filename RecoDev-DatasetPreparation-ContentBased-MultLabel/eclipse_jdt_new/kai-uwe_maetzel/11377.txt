- Start Eclipse
- Open the Windows Task Manager and find the VM running Eclipse
- make sure that Task Manager is set to show the number of threads (View-
>Select Columns->Thread Counts)
- open up Code Assist somewhere in Eclipse
- the Thread Count will increase by one
- click somewhere else
- the Thread Count will decrease by one
- open up Code Assist again
- now press Ctrl+Space a few times while Code Assist is open
- every time you press Ctrl+Space the count increases by one
- click somewhere else
- the Thread Count only decreases by one!
You've just created n zombie threads which are wasting memory.

I discovered this when my VM crashed and I saw a dump of all threads.
Each of the zombie thread stacks look like:

Thread: AdditionalInfo Delay (priority 5)
 ffffffec java/lang/Object.wait(JI)V
 1a3fcd7 java/lang/Object.wait()V  (@01a3fde2)
 ffd7063e org/eclipse/jface/text/contentassist/AdditionalInfoController.run()V 
(@01a3fde2)
 0040 java/lang/Thread.run()V  (@01c2e864)
