I haven't figured out a way to reproduce this problem, but just as a heads-up, 
while editing some JavaDoc comments, my delete key suddenly stopped 
functioning.  I could type any other character and the backspace key still 
worked, so I had a way around it.  The delete key still worked fine in all 
other applicable application windows.  Restarting Eclipse eliminated the 
problem.

I forgot to mention I'm using the M5 build.  It would be nice if the bug 
submission form allowed reporters to select the applicable build.
Could you please check with the latest integration build. We used to have 
some "loss of accelerator" issues which are fixed by now. Propose to close if 
no further incidences.
The last few integration builds have red X's next to them, so I don't want to 
install them.  However, as I stated in the initial description, I can't 
reproduce this problem in M5, let alone some other build.  I just logged this 
in case I or someone else comes across it again.  Feel free to close.
Closed.
