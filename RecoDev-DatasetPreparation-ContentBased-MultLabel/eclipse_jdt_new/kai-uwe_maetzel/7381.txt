1. Pick a class which inplements an interface and delete one of the inplemented 
menthods
2. Do a search for implementors of the interface.
3. Note in the class defintion line that there is a serach result marker and a 
superimposed problem marker
4. Hover over the problem - no help
5. Remove the search result
6. Now the problem hover works.

one idea to address the overlapping annotations problem is to concatenate all 
the marker texts and show them in the tooltip somehow.
Fixed. Show all marker info for markers on the same line. Build 20020312.
