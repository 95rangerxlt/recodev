The Java editor is currently defining a folding region for the top-level type.
I couldn't find a good use of this folding region and in particular it leads 
to some visual instability when hovering in the vertical rule in between 
methods. Therefore I suggest to not add this folding region.

Removing target milestone, no further action for 3.0.
