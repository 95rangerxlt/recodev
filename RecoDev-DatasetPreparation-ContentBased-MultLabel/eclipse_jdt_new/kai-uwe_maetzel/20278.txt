F3 build

Sorry, but we should add back the key bindings for Content Assist and 
Parameter Info for the zh_CN locale.

Should use the same bindings as emacs:
Content Assist: Alt+/
Parameter Info: Alt+?

The reason is that we don't want to rely on the correctness of the 
translations for this to work.  They should also work with the English strings.

Candidate for F4.
