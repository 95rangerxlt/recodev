	the icons for tasks get on top of each other - that's a known thing and you can live with it
	but when you have a warning in a line (so you can still run the program) and set a breakpoint in the same line
	then the dot is not visible, which is very frustrating.
	

NOTES:
EG (11/17/00 6:55:52 PM)
	we should change the layering so that user defined markers show on top of system defined ones.
