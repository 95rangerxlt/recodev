Consider this example:

    while (true)
    {
    }

If I place the caret infront of the w in while, press Shift-Down Arrow twice,
the selection spans three lines, and the Shift-Right/Shift-Left menu-items are
disabled. (Pressing Tab erases the selection at this point).

If instead, I place the caret at the begining of the line with the while on it,
and press Shift-Down Arrow three times, these commands are enabled, and the Tab
key does as expected

this is not the first complaint on this behaviour and we should change it.

Close again.

I assume this has been changed back to the old behaviour because of collision 
with tab-navigation in templates.

Shift Left/Right disabled unless selection is "full lines".
