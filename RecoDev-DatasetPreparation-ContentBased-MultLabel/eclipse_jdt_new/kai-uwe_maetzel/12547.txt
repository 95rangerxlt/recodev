Build 20020328

- I was editing a field in ResourceNavigator (in 
org.eclipse.ui.views.navigator).
- I had the Outline view open.
- Typing was very sluggish.

It was apparently incrementally updating the outline on each key press.
It should have a delay.

Actually, it's sluggish when editing methods too.
I was running with "Synchronize outine selection on cursor move" enabled, but 
disabling it does not seem to improve things.

several perf improvements went into 20020508. We should verify that this 
scenario is covered as well.
It now has no problem keeping up for this case.  Can close.

Build F2.


Editor is sluggish when editing large CU
