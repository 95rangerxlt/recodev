The Quickfix assist dialog in the editor now also show proposal that are 
contributed as MarkerResolutions to (text-) markers.
There is currently no lightbulb shown for such corrections.
This is how to decided if the ligthbulb should be added:
if (annotation instanceof MarkerAnnotation) {
  hasBulb= PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getMarkerHelpRegistry()
   .hasResolutions(((MarkerAnnotation)annotation).getMarker());
}

Maybe this helps: There is a testcase for quickfix coming from 
MarkerResolutions: jdt.ui.tests / MarkerResolutionTest
