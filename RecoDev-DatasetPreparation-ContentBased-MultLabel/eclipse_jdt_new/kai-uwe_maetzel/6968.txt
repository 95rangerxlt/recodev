When you say "Go to line", the editor fills in the current line number where 
the caret is located.  This is never what you want because you are already on 
this line, you never need to go to it.  What would be more useful would be to 
simply remember the last line you typed in, which is more likely to be 
something useful (ie. there was a compile error at 1123 last time).

since the current line number is now shown in the status line we should no 
longer make it the default value in the goto dialog.
Just do it.  The current line number is never useful for "goto line" operations!

Awww ... that's really nice!

This actually works for a while. Forgot to close.


Goto line should not offer the current line number
