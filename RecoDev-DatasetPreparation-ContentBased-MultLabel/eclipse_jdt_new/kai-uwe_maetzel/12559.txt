If I turn on Show Hover Text, and close that perspective, the state is not 
applied across other open perspectives.  It seems arbitrary that that option 
affects all of the editor on the page, but not all Java Editors everywhere.  I 
would like it to be everywhere.

P.S. - When I click on it the tooltip changes to "Hide Hover Text".  Weren't we 
going to change this type of behavior for 2.0?
