Build 20010118

Open two editors on different .java files.
In the first editor, and scroll down and put the cursor at some (scrolled-down) 
point.

Switch to the second editor, then switch back to the first editor.  The text is 
repositioned at the top of the file and you have to scroll down again!

I expect the cursor positions to be maintained in each editor.
