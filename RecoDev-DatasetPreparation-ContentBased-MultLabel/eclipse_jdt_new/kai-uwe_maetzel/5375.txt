Build 20011025

If you click on a bracket in a string or a comment, the brackets remain black.

Steps to replicate:
- Open a java file in an editor and type the following:
  "This [is] a {test}"
  /* This (is) another {test} */

- Click beside any of the brackets so that the bracket matching occurs

- Now click somewhere else

The brackets that were highlighted did not return to their original color.
