The Find/Replace window forgets the current search string if it looses focus and
is then refocussed.

* search for string
* focus the edit window
* focus the Find/Replace window
the Find string reverts to the string when the Find/Replace window was opened
instead of leaving the most recent search string in the Find: edit box

Could not reproduce in F2 on Win. Please verify on Linux. Please add whether 
you are running on Motif or GTK.
I was using a mid april build for motif when I posted this.  I updated to F2
today and it seems to be fixed.
