I added an org.eclipse.ui.actions.AddTaskAction which is virtually identical to 
the org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.AddTaskAction.
Users of the JDT action should adopt the Workbench action just like they do 
with the AddBookmarkAction.

This has been done for M3/4.


Use Workbench AddTaskAction instead of JDT AddTaskAction
