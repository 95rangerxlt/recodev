This could be a core problem - not sure.
If I have an editor open on a file, dirty the editor, delete the file, 
then go back to editor and try to save the file with the name of the file
I just deleted I get an error.

STEPS:
In the Resource perspective:

*Create a java project called my java project.
*In my java project, create a file called Moo.java.  Save the contents below 
 in the Moo.java editor:


public class Moo {
      private int y;
      public Moo() {
      }
      public void doThis() {
      }
      abstract public void doThat();
      public int getX() {
       return x;
      }
     }

*Type something to dirty the editor (e.g. hit return); do not save
*Select Moo.java in the Nav and delete it
*Click on the editor; it will ask if you want to either save the changes or close the 
 editor without saving.  Choose Save.
*Enter Moo.java as the name of the file and select my java project as the folder.
BUG: You get a dialog that says Could not save file.  Reason: Moo.java does not exist.
NOTES:

		Does not happen with the DefaultTextEditor.
		The method performSaveAs in implemented in the subclasses of AbstractTextEditor.
		Moving to JDT.
