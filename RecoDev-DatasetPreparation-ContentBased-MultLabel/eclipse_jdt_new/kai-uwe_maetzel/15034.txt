Two of the JDT actions in the toolbar are missing labels:

"ToggleTextHoverlabel" -> Probably missing the "." between action name and 
"label"

"TooglePresentation.label" -> Probably because Toogle is spelled wrong


Note: if using coolbars, these labels are visible if you slide the button group 
into another button group, and it collapses into a drop-down menu denoted by a 
>> symbol.
