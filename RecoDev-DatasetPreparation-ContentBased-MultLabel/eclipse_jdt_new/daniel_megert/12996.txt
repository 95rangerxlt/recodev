This also happens in Eclipse 2.0 build 20020214

1. install the mulitpage editor example into the workspace
2. in a project create a file of type .mpe
3. a multipage editor opens on this new file.  Leave the editor open.
4. select File/Export/Jar File.  Fill in the jar file and click finish.
You get the following Jar Export Error:
Creation of JAR failed
Invalid thread access

Is there any stack dump in the .log file?

This appears to be a problem with the example - it does not occur when other 
editors are open. However it can still be replicated in 20020404
Actually it occurs with a couple of other mulitpage editors that are part of 
WSDD - MultipageBundleEditor and P3mlEditor.  The three open editors that show 
this problem are all subclasses (and the **only** subclasses that I have 
installed) of MultiPageEditorPart.  None of the three override isDirty(). It 
looks like this implemenation of isDirty() leads to getting the contents of the 
CTabItem widget, which causes the check for thread access.  

I looked at the PDE's plugin.xml editor to see why the problem does not occur 
there and found that it is a subclass of EditorPart, and it's implementation of 
isDirty() does not access the contents of a widget. The same is true for other 
editor's within the workbench.
Moving to JDT. Janelle is right that it is a problem independant of the example 
as the issue is with the JarFileExportOperation.preconditionsOK method.

The problem is that the jar file export operation is checking that all editors 
are saved before it runs - but this is done outside of the UI process which 
causes the problem. This should be synchExeced in the UI.

This is a problem for several users of getDirtyEditors(). The
MultiPageEditorPart code in the workbench should not access the widget to answer
the isDirty state. MultiPageEditorPart already has a field nestedEditors which
could be used to return the isDirty state.

This should be fixed for M5 since other products will be based on M5. If
workbench does not fix then we (JDT) should fix it.


The UI components should only be called in the UI thread.
There is no guarantee that other editors won't talk to SWT.
The Jar exporter needs to be fixed.

However, I have made the recommended change to MultiPageEditorPart as an 
expedient solution for M5.


we should fix it in JDT. Nick is correct the workbench API is consistent and 
only allows requests in the UI thread so we should comply with this rule.
Deprecated the unsafe method and added a safe one.
Using the safe one in my code. Other will have to adapt.

*** Bug 23390 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Is it feasible to backport/apply this fix to 1.x?
To which fix do you refer: the one in the MultiPageEditorPart or all the usages
of isDirty in JDT UI?

What I really want is a way to address the duplicate of this:

http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23390

I'm tempted to say I would like the JDT_UI fix, but maybe that's because I 
don't understand the MultiPageEditorPart fix.
I see you refer to WSAD 4.0. I suggest an upgrade to WSAD 5.0 which has been
released today.

A fix is needed on WSAD 4.03 if possible. 
I assume there's an official path for fixes to WSWB (i.e. WSAD). For example
release 2.0.1 was provided for 2.0.
Not sure I understand the last entry.  The official path for fixes is through 
the WSWB support team in Phoenix.  WSAD reports problems to Phx and we 
negotiate with them, the customer and development if a back port is requested.  
We try to keep these to a minimum.  Sometime, however, there are good reasons 
to provide fixes to a prior release.  I believe this is one of those.  Shane 
can probably expand on this.   ...  Of course if it is not possible to do 
so, ...... that would also be good to know.
I was led to believe we would explore a backport of this fix.  Can someone 
supply some status on that?
Here is a version of MultiPageEditorPart (see attachment) for the fix in 1.0.

1.0 verstion of MultiPageEditorPart with fix
Do you have this in .jar file format?
We will be doing a build with this patch in sometime this week.
