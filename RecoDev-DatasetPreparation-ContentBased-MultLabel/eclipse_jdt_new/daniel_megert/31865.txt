Jerome,

I can't reproduce this using I200302131253. Is there anything special with your 
workspace. Can you zip it ?
Created attachment 3490
Test workspace 

I'm using I200302131356. Could that be the difference? Anyway I attached a
simple workspace that shows the problem.
To reproduce:
1. Start the attached workspace
2. Click on X.java (this will open it as I'm using single-click open)
3. Close editor X.java
4. Select foo and popup the menu
-> The submenu only has 'Test' available
Actually the steps above don't reproduce the problem. Let me try again:
1. Start the attached workspace
2. Click on foo (this will open X.java as I'm using single-click open)
3. Popup the menu
-> The submenu only has 'Test' available
Was caused by the Package Explorer comparer.
