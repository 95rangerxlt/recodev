Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=5f7bb57b8210eb2cc852a72b647615ef084808bc

BTW: shouldn't the version in a/pom.xml be 3.9.0?

The repo's parent pom version isn't really used anywhere other than for maven. So the build will still produce correctly regardless of this. However for consistency with the repo it is possible to change this to 3.9.0 but this would involve also modifying every pom under this pom to say that it's parent is now version 3.9.0.
