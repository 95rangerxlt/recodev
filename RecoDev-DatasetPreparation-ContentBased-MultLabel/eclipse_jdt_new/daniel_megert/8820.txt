When showing Java search results, there's a context item for Open Type 
Hierarchy, but F4 doesn't work.
This fix needs two changes and is not a quick fix:
1) The OpenHierarchyAction has to set the accelerator to SWT.F4
2) For each new search (result), Search has to build a dummy context menu and
extract the accelerators from those actions put them in a list and act upon
matching key pressed event. BTW: The class AcceleratorHook seems to go in that
direction.

Adding listeners in the view is not the way to go - especially not because we
want to let this be user configurable.

According to EG view actions DO NOT have shortcuts. If they show a global action
which is contributed by action set or editor then this should be done with
retargetable actions. To make this work in search, those retargetable actions
will have to work for markers too.
Also added Open (F3)
