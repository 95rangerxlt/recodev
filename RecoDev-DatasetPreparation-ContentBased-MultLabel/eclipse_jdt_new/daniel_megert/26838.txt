Search for references to Class.forName(String) (using element search) in self-
hosting workspace. Some of the search results are missing qualification ?!?

Now try to sort them in different order, nothing happens (i.e. sort using 
parent name).

There seems to be something wierd. I also see the following problems:
- sometimes not all sort options available
- I can check more than one sorting option

Performance optimization in Workbench seems to break existing code: the context
menu is no longer constructed each time but cached.

Adapted to those changes.
