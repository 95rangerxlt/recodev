I was always amazed when I saw spelling errors in Javadocs, since spell checking is available and enabled by default in the Eclipse SDK.

Only today, I think I found the real reason: The default setting for "Maximum number of problems reported per file" is only 100. In a *.java file with many technical comments, this limit is quickly exceeded, and you're running blind for the rest of the file.

Either the default needs to be increased (I run with 1000), or it needs to be changed in *.java files to apply per comment and not per file.
