- create JUnit
- set filter Hide Non-Java Projects
- close JUnit
  observe: JUnit is gone.

The reason is that closed projects don't have a nature anymore. So either the 
filter shouldn't filter closed projects or the close action should warn about 
the filter. But this only works if the close action is activated from the 
packae explorer. The Navigator doesn't know anything about the filter.

Or we should change the name of the filter to Hide closed and Non Java Projects.
NonJava* filters no longer filter closed projects.
Use "Closed projects" filter to hide closed projects.
