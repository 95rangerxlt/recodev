Sometimes the hotkey (ctrl-shift-f) and the menu entry for formatting the 
source code are disabled, while the entry in the context menu is enabled and 
works as expected. I didn't find any patterns on when this occurs till now.

Open the popup menu. You will see that the format option is enabled. The format 
menu item in the source menu is also enabled. Now select some text and try to 
use the format option from the popup menu. You will see that it is disabled. 
Deselect your selection and look at the format menu item in the source menu. It 
is also disabled and will stay disabled. Open the popup menu. The format item 
is enabled. Open the source menu. Now the format menu item is also enabled.
When you use the format item in the source menu when you have text selected 
everything works fine.
Sometimes I encounter this bug after copying and pasting some text. It does not happen all the time, only now and then. I'm not sure at the moment, but I think it does not happen during "normal" typing.
I first noticed this bug in 2.1M3 (didn't tried M1 and M2), M4 is affected, too.
The enable state of the format action seems to be only updated when the context
menu is opened but not when the selection changes.

Workaround to get format (Ctrl+Shift+F) action:
1. Empty selection in editor
2. Open editor context menu
==> Format is available

The format TextOperation was not marked as selection dependent action.
Fixed.
