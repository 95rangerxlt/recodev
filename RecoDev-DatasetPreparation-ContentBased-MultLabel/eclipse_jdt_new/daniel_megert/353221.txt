BETA_JAVA7, same in 3.6.2

package xy;
public class Try {
	void foo() {
		equals(); // add breakpoint
	}
}

- add a line breakpoint to indicated line
- put caret at end of line
- Ctrl+1
=> expected: Caret should jump to error position
=> was: Caret stays at end, no quick fix offered

This used to work but got broken in two steps:

- First it got broken when we introduced the jumping: there it worked at the
  end of the line but not at the beginning.
- Then the range of the line breakpoint was changed, which also broke it for
  the end of the line.
