3.2.1 and latest 3.3 build

Code assist for spelling proposals does not work.
Fixed in 3.3.
Available in builds > N20061123-0010.

Needs to be backported to 3.2.2.
This might pose some risk because this is the first entry which is contributed to the default code assist category via plugin.xml. Won't backport since this isn't critical.
