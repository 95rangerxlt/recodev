The toolbar button has no effect.
Actually, can't turn it off in PDE either. (What a pain.) Must be a Java text
editor problem, not a debugger problem.
More details appreciated... What text hover are you trying to "turn off". Text 
hover is supposed to turn off automatically when you move your mouse off of the 
item showing the information.
How many different text hovers are there?

The text hover that I want to turn off, that is supposed to be switchable on and
off from the toolbar button with the tooltip "Show Text Hover", is the same one
that is supposed to turn itself off automatically when you move the mouse away
from the text.

Which it doesn't do, either. I filed a bug on this months ago. If you move the
mouse cursor to the right of text that would show hover text, it still shows
because the code doesn't correctly detect that the cursor is beyond the end of
line. This is a major annoyance, leading to cases where I have to move the mouse
all the way outside the view to get the blasted thing to shut up.

Which is one major reason that I want to be able to shut this feature off
permanently.

It is also true that the Show Text Hover button is a preference in disguise and
should be in the preferences pages where it can be unambiguously switched off
and exported with other preferences. This was the subject of a separate bug
report, also with no action.

I am hoping for better luck with this one, as having a button in the toolbar
that doesn't do anything seems unambiguously to be a bug. ;-}
I did not even realize this feature existed. Moving to JDT-UI.
Didn't mean to dump on you, sorry. You can see I've got a history with this
feature. ;-}
The comes from the text iternal modifier tracker. There is no way to get this 
right without SWT support. For now, we should extend disabling to all newly 
introduced hovers.
I fixed the internal modifier tracker.
Will be in next build.
