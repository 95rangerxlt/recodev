See attached screenshot of context menus of Call Hierarchy view and Search View

2 things..
1) 'Remove from view' should use the same icon as the one is search view
2) The placement of this action is inconsistent with the Search view. In Search view the action is placed along with Copy actions, but in Call Hierarchy view it is not. (I am fine if this is fixed in the Search view, I just want the placement to be consistent)

I agree. Icon added in HEAD (RemoveFromViewAction rev. 1.5).

Regarding the placement of the action: I think the Call Hierarchy placement is better as normally the command that is along with Copy is 'Delete' on the element.

Markus, +1?

Then we improve it in Search View? As both actions do the same thing - remove the item from the view and even have the key binding.

I just want the placement to be consistent, I filed this bug because I do not reach the action in the context menu quick enough in both the views. It is in one place in one view and another place in other view...
I hear you - you now said two times what you *want* and I already agreed in comment 1 ;-)

>Then we improve it in Search View?
Yes.

Alright, thanks! You did not say this in comment 1, at least not explicitly :)

First sentence: "I agree". What can I do more than agreeing with you ;-)

The 'Remove' commands in question here do 'delete' the element from the view and the key binding is also 'Delete', so I think Search view is better.

Yeah, but 'delete' normally deletes the element. Sorry, here I disagree ;-)

ping..
I agree with Deepak: We use the Delete command with the Delete key-binding, so I also expect to see this in the usual place for Delete actions.

The action name clearly says it doesn't delete the resource, so that shouldn't be too confusing.

What *was* confusing was that the Remove action had the wrong icon.
I've fixed that in HEAD of RemoveFromViewAction.

My bad. I picked the same icon as the Delete action has, since we retarget that one. Thanks for fixing this.

Unfortunately the Edit > Delete menu is not a retarget action hence it will still say "Delete".

Discussed this with Markus: the 'Delete' action in the CCP group deletes the element while the Remove action works on the view, hence it makes sense to put it into a different group.

We also decided that it should be the last element in the group.
Fixed in HEAD (SearchView.java rev. 1.76).
Available in builds >= N20101122-2000.

Also filed bug 330797 and bug 330802.
