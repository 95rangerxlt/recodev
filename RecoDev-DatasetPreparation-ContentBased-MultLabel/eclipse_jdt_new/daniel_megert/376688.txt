Build Identifier: 3.8.0 I20120314-1800

Which checkboxes are selected in "Which method stubs would you like to create?" is not remembered across invocations of the new class wizard although NewPackageWizardPage tries to save them. The problem seems to be that NewPackageWizardPage#setVisible(false) is never invoked because WizardDialog#finishPressed() sends #hardClose()

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Invoke the New Class wizard
2. Check "public static void main(String[] args)"
3. Uncheck "Constructors from superclass"
4. Uncheck "Inherited abstract methods"
5. Create the class
6. Invoke the New Class wizard again

Expected result:
Which method stubs would you like to create?
 [x] public static void main(String[] args)
 [ ] Constructors from superclass
 [ ] Inherited abstract methods

Actual result:
Which method stubs would you like to create?
 [ ] public static void main(String[] args)
 [ ] Constructors from superclass
 [x] Inherited abstract methods
