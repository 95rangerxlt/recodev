To make subwords completion work for almost all standard completions, I had to copy the following classes because they have a final modifier:

org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.FilledArgumentNamesMethodProposal
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.LazyGenericTypeProposal
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ParameterGuessingProposal

Is is possible to remove the final modifier from these classes?


It would be nice if this change can make it into Juno release; it would make our codebase a bit cleaner for 3.9.

Fixed in master: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=4df8e6fbb82fe6b789b6e537f3d9af7a0b860420
