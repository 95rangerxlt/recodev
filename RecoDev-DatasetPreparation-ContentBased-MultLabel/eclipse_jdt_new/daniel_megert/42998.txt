1. select SearchMessages.properties (in search plug-in) in the Navigator
2. press Ctrl+H
3. select Enclosing Project scope
4. click the search button

Observe: the list contains too many entries.
Clarification: The list contains only one entry, but the number of matches is
different (4 if using workspace scope, 156 when using selected project scope).
We are not correctly calculating the java projects enclosing the selection.
We're doing (in pseudocode):

for (elements in selection)
    javaElement= getJavaElement(element in selection);
    addToScope( getJavaProject(javaElement))

However, if the element in the selection is a resource, getJavaElement() returns
null.
