ASTProviderTest fails and is not in CoreTests suite.
Problem is probably the magic '35' (offset moves if line.separator is two characters long).
It passes for me...
...and on the Linux on the build machine.
Yeah, the test is sometimes green -- but only in case it didn't really work. Set a breakpoint on line 135 at assertEquals(..) and see how it *never* gets hit (because "ast" is always null).

Dani, please have a look. If I understood bug 181257 correctly, the test should actually
- use "33" as offset on line 72
- use the SharedASTProvider.WAIT_ACTIVE_ONLY flag
- assertNotNull(ast)
Fixed in HEAD. Also fixed a bug in AbstractReconciler.java (rev. 1.41).
