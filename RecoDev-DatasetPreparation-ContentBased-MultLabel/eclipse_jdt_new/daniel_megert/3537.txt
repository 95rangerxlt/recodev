If we don't get functionality for disassembling class files for 2.0 we should 
at least have an indication somewhere that a source attachment is missing.
source attachment indicator missing added.
disassembler deferred.
Reopen to investigate together with Adrian whether there's a legal issue in using JDT Core's Disassembler API.
Got the OK from Adrian.
Fixed in HEAD.
Available in builds > N20060907-0010.

NOTE: the fix is not yet 100% since it depends on bug 150244.
