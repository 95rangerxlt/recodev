Templates content assist additional info is outdated and improvable.

- Some proposals like arg have a cryptic string at the end. I guess that's an example of usage. If so, then this should be clearly stated with a title "Example: ..."

- arg: refers to TypeVar, should be arg
- elem: refers to ElementType
- name and var: should have an example

- variables that accept arguments should
  - show their arguments in the proposal name
  - start their additional info with the full definition as in help, e.g.
    ${id:var(type name)} for var

Done except for
  >- show their arguments in the proposal name
because the current architecture doesn't allow '(' and ')' in the name and there are no plans to change this.
