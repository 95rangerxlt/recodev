Up to now the selection in the browsing views was always in sync with the caret
location in the editor because we reconciled the CU in the UI thread using:

    synchronized (unit) {
        unit.reconcile(false, null);
    }

This caused performance blockers in the UI for large files. We now only set the
selection if the CU is consistent. As a result, if the name of a member is
changed in the editor then it will no longer be selected in the Members view.

This can be fixed in three ways:
1) the editor offers clients a reconciled listener
2) the browsing views setup a thread which reconciles the CU, but this can
result in several reconcile calls since the selection change and the background
reconciler aren't in sync
3) the browsing views setup a thread that polls whether the CU is reconciled

I prefer 1) since the time when the update is done is then in sync with the
outline page synchronization.

Daniel is there anything planned in text to resolve this ?
Infrastructure is there. We could fix this (time permitting during bug fixing
milestone).
Daniel I will assign this to you to decide if you can do something for 3.0
low prio
not for 3.0
    synchronized (unit) {
        unit.reconcile(false, null);
    }

is no longer needed at all and has been removed from all JDT code.


Java Browsing selection should be updated when CU is reconciled
