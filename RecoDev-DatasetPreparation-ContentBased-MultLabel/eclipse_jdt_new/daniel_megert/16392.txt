build 2002-05-19 on WinXP.
IBM JRE 1.3.1.

I did a text search and got over 100 hits. I selected a handful of them and 
then chose "remove entries" from the context menu. I got error dialogs for 
each result I wanted to remove. Looks like the markers have been removed and 
the search view is trying to access attributes?

I will attach the log file.

Actually it looks like it is trying access the same (non-existing) marker 
multiple times?
