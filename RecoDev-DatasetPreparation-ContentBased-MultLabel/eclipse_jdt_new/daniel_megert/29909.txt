I have my preferences set as follows:
Java | Editor | Displayed tab width: 8
Java | Code formatter | Insert tabs for indentation: No
Java | Code formatter | Number of spaces representing an indentation level: 4

When I have the following code:

class ContainerSelection extends Selection
{
}

and I position the caret after the { and press Enter, Eclipse inserts a new 
line and 8 spaces. It should only insert 4.
