Lots of constansts are either strings or int. Would be nice to have a template
for the to which would save some typing.

Would this fit your needs:

constant:
  ${visibilty} static final ${type} ${name};

or would you need all three variants:
public constant:
  public static final ${type} ${name};
protected constant:
  protected static final ${type} ${name};
private constant:
  private static final ${type} ${name};
ping.
we could now also write:

${visibility:link(public,protected,private)} static final ${type:link(String,int)} ${name};

?
Sounds good. Dirk, does this fit your needs?

Could the template please be stored without line delimiter after the modifiers? The current template is inconsistent with other templates when the code formatter is turned off.
Oh, and ${name} should  be changed to ${NAME}.
Thanks, good catch.
Fixed in HEAD.
