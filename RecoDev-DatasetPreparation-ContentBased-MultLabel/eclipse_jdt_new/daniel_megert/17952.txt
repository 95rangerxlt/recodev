The definition of the Open Type action is

<action id="openType"
			menubarPath="navigate/openGroup"
			toolbarPath="Normal/Java"			
			label="%OpenTypeAction.label"
			tooltip="%OpenTypeAction.tooltip"
			icon="icons/full/ctool16/opentype.gif"
		
	class="org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.OpenTypeAction"/>

As it does not define the accelerator it relies on the label which is currently 
untranslated. This should not be used as 2.0 supports language neutral 
accelerator definitions. The line 

accelerator="Ctrl+Shift+T"


Should be added to the definition.

Are you saying that Ctrl+Shift+T now appears both in the plugin.xml and in 
the .properties file? If I remember properly, JFace has added support to deal 
with the translations of Ctrl etc. This means clients do not have to do this.
The support for translated accelerators was a patch for rollup3 for 1.0 and was 
never API. It was removed for 2.0.

You should always define defualt accelerators in the actions - these are 
untranslated. 
Support for translated accelerators has been re-introduced for build >20020529. 
Marking this as P4.

changed milestone from F1 to F2
removed the milestone assignment since bug got deferred
Should be fixed for 2.1. Must also consider compare and search.
explainations from Nick on this topic:

We have decided to add it back because of this.

Early in 2.0 we decided that the workaround for the NL rollup for 1.0 did not 
make sense: it was too fragile to require translators to translate the 
modifiers and we were seeing lots of mistakes that were hard to find (this is 
still the case -- see below).
We added support to be able to specify the accelerator using 
Action.setAccelerator, and an accelerator= attribute in the plugin.xml.
Unfortunately, for backwards compatibility, we kept the support for parsing the 
accelerators from the text, but this only supported English.
We also did a poor job of telling people how it should be done.

Ideally one would just set the accelerators programmatically in a language-
insensitive way, we would not support extracting them from the text, and we 
would generate the language-specific accelerator text from the set 
accelerator.  But we failed on that and it's too late to change it now.

So, we are now going back to the 1.0 NL rollup behaviour (plus keeping the 
ability to set accelerators separately, which overrides the accelerator 
extracted from the text).
Tod has commented and reduced the priority of the PRs he filed to P4.
Although it would be preferable to use setAccelerator and accelerotor=, if this 
is not done it will still work correctly as long as the translations are done 
properly.
There are no changes required from you.

Note that Ctrl+Space will still not work currently in German because the 
translations are buggy.  We are working on getting them fixed.
Again, no work required from you on this.

Added accelerator attribute to action definitions in JDT/UI. Moving to Search 
to add accelerator for Ctrl+H as well.
Was already there in search
Verified compare: ok
Closing PR.
Available in HEAD and 2.1 builds > I20020903


Since milestones are now available, changing milestone from "2.1" to "2.1 M1".
