Section is called 'Foreground' but should IMHO be called 'Element'. Same as on the syntax coloring preference page.
Fixed in HEAD.

Steve, in order to fix this for 3.2.1 we would need to change an NLS property value in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.preferences/PreferencesMessages.properties:

The value for PropertiesFileEditorPreferencePage_foreground

would change from "Fo&reground:" to "&Element:"

Is that a problem for you (i.e. translation)?

Steve, can you please comment. Thanks.
My opinion would be to not change it.  I think "Foreground" is more correct in the properties context.  These are not "Elements" of Java like they are on the syntax coloring page.  In fact, I think it a bit of accident of history that the properties file editing is in JDT.  It really should be independent.  IMHO.
Yes but it sets the forground of the elements that can be found in the list. I think "Foreground:" is not precise enough here.

Well yes and no: the Java Properties files are different form other properties files, e.g. it has specific characteristics like a fixed encoding that must not be changed and allows almost all key value pairs while other properties file have a fixed set of key and values. I agree that the platform could provide a generic configurable properties file editor though. But that's another issue ;-)
You can checkout how it looks by using one of the latest 3.3 builds. The question is whether it is OK to release this into the 3.2.1 stream or whether you prefer not to do so in order to minimize translation efforts for 3.2.1.
Not for 3.2.1. Same problem was already in 3.1.2 - so no regression.
WRT comment 6 and comment 7, I agree.  Sorry I was late.
No problem.
