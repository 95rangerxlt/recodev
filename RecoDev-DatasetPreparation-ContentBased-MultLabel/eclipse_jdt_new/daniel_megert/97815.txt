*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 66264 ***
Reopening, since bug 66264 has been marked as fixed, but this still fails.

See also bug 64050 and bug 67500.
This is really a dup of bug 108674 combined with bug 67500. Fixing one of them however won't fix this bug until the other is fixed too. Leaving open for now.
Fixed in HEAD.
