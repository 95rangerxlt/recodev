1. edit in a file, don't save
2. open the JAR packager on it's project
3. enter all path, destination, name of jar packager description, etc
4. press finish: 'JAR creation failed: Unsaved Editors'
5. To save, I have to quit the wizard, save, open the wizard again and then 
enter all fields again

- I should be allowed to create a JAR with unsaved editors
- If not, there should be a dialog to allow saving

Agree, behaviour is suboptimal for user.
changed the priority since it can be really annoying.
You can have unsaved files but not if they get exported. Having said that - is
it ok for you if you get a dialog where you can choose to either save the files
or quit? I could also show which files would be saved.

A dialog which let's you choose some files makes no sense because don't want to
add what's in the editor nor the old file.


ok or quit is ok for me.
