The "Saving Files..." part of the Export Jar wizard takes several minutes. 
This could be because the jar I am rebuilding in on my classpath... I do not 
know since the feedback only says "Saving Files...". So, perhaps only better 
feedback is needed if e is recompiling my project.

Gray,

do you have autobuild on ?
Ah, yes, I do. I should have put that detail in, sorry. Is e recompiling the 
world and not letting me know?
I guess so. Your scenario isn't very common. Given this and the fact that we 
only fixing a handfull PRs for RC4, this has to wait for 2.2
Check. This is definitively in the "make eclipse more friendly, less 
mysterious" category.
Were there any open files that were saved during the export?
Can you give more data about the amount of files in the JAR and how many
projects depend on the newly generated JAR?

Fixed: it will now show exactly what auto-build is doing.
