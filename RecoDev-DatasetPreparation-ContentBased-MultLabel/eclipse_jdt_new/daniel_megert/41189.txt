No news on this one? I get biten by this one all the time. The javadoc hover always misses half of the information.

If 'bold' rendering is a problem, I would suggest that we skip that ans use a normal font.
I'll see what we can do here.

Fixed in HEAD: we're now using the Browser widget for hovers.
