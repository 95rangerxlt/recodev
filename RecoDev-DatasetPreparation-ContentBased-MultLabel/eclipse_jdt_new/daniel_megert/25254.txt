Build 2.1 M2

In my workspace, I had search results (search declarations of 
#getElementsByTagName(String) in hierarchy of org.wc3.dom.Element).

I went to a test project and changed its classpath entry "src" to read:
<classpathentry kind="src" path="src" excluding="foo|bar" excluding="foo|bar" />

When reconciling the change, an XML parse error got diagnosed, but surprisingly 
some of the search result icons become red square (some missing icon I guess).

Build 2.1 M2

In my workspace, I had search results (search declarations of 
#getElementsByTagName(String) in hierarchy of org.wc3.dom.Element).

I went to a test project and changed its classpath entry "src" to read:
<classpathentry kind="src" path="src" excluding="foo|bar" excluding="foo|bar" />

When reconciling the change, an XML parse error got diagnosed, but surprisingly 
some of the search result icons become red square (some missing icon I guess).
Because of the XML parse error, rt.jar (that contains the search results) was 
removed from the classpath (I verified that the correct delta was sent out). 
But the search results are still present. And the correct icons cannot be 
displayed since the corresponding IJavaElements throw a not present exception.

Moving to JDT/UI for comment.
Daniel, can you please comment on this.
The problem is that search component does *not* get a marker delta and search is
marker based. There are plans to change this.

For now I added two fixes
- if the icon is there a refresh will not touch it
- replaced the red square icon with another icon in case the table item is redrawn

Note: I could remove the underlying marker whenever the image of an nonexistent
Java element is requested however this resulted in many resource deltas (I can
not modify the markers during a marker resource/Java element delta and hence
would have to post them).
