HEAD and BETA_JAVA7

On the Hovers preference page, the Javadoc hover should have default modifiers set. I suggest Ctrl+Shift. The Javadoc hover is often useful even if the Combined Hover shows a problem hover.

Bug 243397 requests a possibility to easily jump to the Javadoc hover, but I think the separate modifier would still be useful.


BTW: I don't see what the default modifier for the "Externalized String" hover is good for. I would remove that.
