I was looking at the project summary page and there seems to be a problem with the project plan display.  What I saw was :

- http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=eclipse.jdt displays a blank screen

- http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=eclipse.jdt&raw=1 displays raw html project plan, which is not easily readable.

- http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/r3.6/plan.php displays a nice page, but is not so easy to found

Dani, the portal for eclipse.jdt has 3 links to HTML pages in the projectplanurl field:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Plan/3.6
http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/r3.6/plan.php
http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/r3_6/plan.php

But the field says it only supports 1 entry and that should be in XML form as described here: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Project_Plan#Specifying_the_Plan

We should either delete the projectplanurl field, or create an XML that points to the component plans.
Fixed in the portal.


Project meta-data needs improvement.
