JDT UI from CVS HEAD as of today (06/10/2008).

Just stumbled across EditorBreadcrumb#createContent

public Control createContent(Composite parent) {
	if (fComposite != null)
		new IllegalArgumentException("Content must only be created once."); //$NON-NLS-1$
		
There is a "throw" missing in order to achieve the goal.

Fix
Ooops, my fault. This is not the first time that this happens to me. I've filed bug 236385 against JDT/Core to add a compiler warning for this.
Use Assert to prevent this problem.
I suggest to to fix for 3.5 rather than 3.4.1

Yes, why 3.4.1? No harm done, if you call it twice you probably will get 2 breadcrumbs.

Yes, "probably", but you don't know whether this will work at all then. So it's better to make that fix and get feedback in case this really happens.
Fixed in HEAD.

Fix is good, although not really relevant for 3.4.1.
OK, so we have 3 people that don't want/need this for 3.4.1 so let's drop it.
