The OrganizeImportsPerfTest has no loop and no warm up, which makes the test unreliable. Also we use clean up to run Organize imports in the UI since a while (bug 181160). We should therefore also test this real world scenario.

fixed in HEAD and perf stream
Sorry, this was not really clear, this is not fixed in the sense that the existing test is fixed. But I've added a new test which should replace the existing test later in the fingerprint. I don't want to touch the exiting one until we know what's going on in bug 206013
I don't know what to do here. I opt to switch to new test once the new one is not yellow anymore (bug 212388)
Marking as wontfix then, workaround is to use to the new test (the clean up test) which has a warm up and a loop.
Should delete the bogus test.
>Should delete the bogus test.
Or even better: just fix it!
Fix is in HEAD (OrganizeImportsPerfTest rev. 1.6.) but needs to be backported to perf_34x.
Backported to perf_34x.
