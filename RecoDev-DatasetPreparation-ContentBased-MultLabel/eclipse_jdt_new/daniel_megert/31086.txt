I'm using the Java Browsing perspective and I'm displaying the default 
decorator for CVS.

When I start clicking around in the Types view, I've noticed that the 
decoration is refreshed for the projects and the packages too. 

If I clicked on a type on which I already clicked previously the refresh is not 
done.

Daniel, is this us or CVS ?
If its not JDT UI its UI, it can't be VCM since we just provide decorators 
when asked, and respond to deltas (which doesn't fit this case).
The full refresh of the Types view has been fixed. Each view will get one
refresh if a CU is opened or closed. We can't assume that the labels and icons
don't change (imagine a decorator that adds a * if one of the CUs is being edited).



Decorators are refreshed to frequently [browsing]
