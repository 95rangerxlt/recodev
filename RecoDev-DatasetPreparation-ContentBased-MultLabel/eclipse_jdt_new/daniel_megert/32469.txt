The breakpoint shows as disabled in the breakpoints view.
It does not show as disabled in the editor ruler. Points to a problem in 
another component.
If the editor is closed and reopened, the breakpoint is rendered with the 
disabled icon.
Adam can you ask around in ZRH if this is likely a JDT UI or Text change 
problem? 
Is there anything in the .log?
I have nothing in my log when I see the problem.
nope, nothing in the log, i think

no, nothing obvious on our side - but anything is possible
I have verified that the JavaMarkerAnnotation is not asking for the new image 
when the breakpoint state changes. However, I am not sure why. The source code 
looks like it should be - but when I step over the line, the execution jumps to 
a blank line. Very strange - I will have to get the real source (instead of 
binary plug-in) to see what is going on...
I beleive the problem is coming from the annotation update code in either JUI 
or JFACE text. I am not familiar with the code, but I have verified that the 
marker delta is being processed by the annotation model, but never asks for the 
new breakpoint image.
The stepping problem I saw (in comment #5), was due to a PDE source lookup bug. 
Once I changed the PDE preferences, my source matched the classfiles. I see 
that the old code used to set a new breakpoint image in 
JavaMarkerAnnotation#initialize(), but the new code only sets an image type. 
Since breakpoint images have state (i.e. more than one state), this does not 
seem sufficient (but I am not familiar with the code).
This could be a regression which was introduced by fixing bug 29696.
Quick fix would be to revert to the previous version of JavaMarkerAnnotation.
