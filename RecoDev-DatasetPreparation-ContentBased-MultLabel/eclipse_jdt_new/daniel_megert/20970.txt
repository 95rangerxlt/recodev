Build 20020625 (GM2)

A post 2.0 feature request...

I think it would be useful to have "filter classes" and "filter interfaces" in 
the type browsing view.

One use scenario for this: when the type hierarchy view is open on a package, it 
can't show interfaces.  To get around this I generally stack the type browsing 
view with the type hierarchy view, so I can look at interfaces as well as 
classes.  For this case it would be nice to be able to filter out classes in the 
type browsing view.

This would be a useful filter in other views as well.
Yep could be registered as general filter.

FYI: There is now already a "Hide non-public types" filter in the Types view


This feature is expensive in other views (e.g. Package Explorer) since it would
need to open the CU (and hence populate the Java Model).

Marking as fixed until "real" request comes for another concrete view.

Fix available in 2.1 builds > 20020819
Since milestones are now available, changing milestone from "2.1" to "2.1 M1".
