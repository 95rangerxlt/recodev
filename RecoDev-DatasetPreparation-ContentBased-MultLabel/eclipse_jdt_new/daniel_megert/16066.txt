I was working on a new project. I created the 
packages "org.eclipse.team.internal.ftp" 
and "org.eclipse.team.internal.ftp.client". After the second package was 
created, the first disappeared. I wanted to move code to both packages so I 
tried to recreate the first but when I did the packages view did not change 
(i.e. only shows me "org.eclipse.team.internal.ftp.client").

this is a consequence of filtering out empty inner packages. It is a usability 
issue we are aware of.

The move dialog shows you all packages.

Dani, I think we have already discussed this as part of the package filter 
enhancement work. The ideas was to offer a filter for removing empty inner 
packages, by default this filter is off and users will see
org
org.eclipse
org.eclipse.jdt.
...
users will then learn that there is filtering going on.

Changed summary to "User configurable Empty Inner Package Filter"
Set severity to "enhancement"

Done. Very nice filtering support now :-)
Verified.
