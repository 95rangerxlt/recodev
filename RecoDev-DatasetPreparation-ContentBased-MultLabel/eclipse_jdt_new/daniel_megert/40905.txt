Build M2

I enjoy the new Javadoc view and use it all the time. 

It would be even more useful if it showed more contextual information about 
the element. In particular,
- For classes and interfaces, it is really important to show what package it 
is declared in. This could probably be incorporated into the view title.

- For fields, methods, and constructors it is important to show what class or 
interface it is declared in. It might be possible to incorporate it into the 
view title; if not, it could be put at the beginning of the view body.

Several improvements have been made (available in builds > 20030730):
- title shows qualified information
- Selecting Javadoc in the editor feeds the Javadoc view
- computation is done in the background
- the view is "live" i.e. if you type Javadoc for an element the Javadoc view 
  will update itself. This will be very useful (as preview) once we can use the 
  HTML widget inside the Javadoc view.

Note: title tooltip shows the fully qualified element (with method parameters)
already for M2.

fixed.
