M20080827-2000 (same problem in 3.4 and HEAD)

Reproduce bug 237592 (enable the save action on the project, not in the preferences).

=> The link to the preference page opens the Preferences dialog.
=> Expected: Should open the project-specific Properties dialog, like we do it everywhere else where the setting can also be configured per project.
