Kai,

I tend to offer a preference which allows power users to unlink the next/prev
actions.

If, like Erich, you also vote against this I will remove the corresponding code
from code, XML and schema.

Would be nice to have the preference as a checkmark menuitem in the dropdown
(last, after a separator).

As a side-effect, this tells the user whether the change will apply to the other
direction too.
I don't think so. This would pollute the UI for the 0815 user.

Let's try to keep this as simple as possible.


[navigation] Next/Previous drop downs should be linked
