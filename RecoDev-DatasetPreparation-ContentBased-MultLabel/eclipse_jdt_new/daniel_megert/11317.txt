Create a new java project called "Foo".
In the file system, create a folder named "Foo scripts", and in this folder 
create a file named "foo.txt".
Drag this folder into the eclipse packages view and add it to the "Foo" project.

Now try to export the project "Foo" to a .jar file.  Only the manifest file 
shows up, even if the file "foo.txt" is checked!

The problem was that due to the space in the name the folder is not reconized as
package and therefore getting the package root failed (correct). However this
folder must also be exported.

Fixed.
