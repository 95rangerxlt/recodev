"Preferences > Java > Compiler > Javadoc" has two options ("Missing Javadoc tags" and "Missing Javadoc comments") with sub-options named "Check overriding and implementing methods".

Unfortunately, the label of the sub-options is ambiguous, see bug 216258 for explanations. We should also invert the sense of the checkboxs here and rename them to: "Ignore in overriding and implementing methods" (checked by default).
