Build Identifier: 20110615-0604

My workspace has type hierarchy active on my Workspace on startup.  I believe that View is responsible for leaving an unpainted, gray modeless floating rectangle over or under other parts of UI.  

If I horizontally expand and collapse the column that the type hierarchy is in, I can get the rectangle to be clearly visible.  If I collapse the column enough, I can get the rectangle to disappear, and briefly I catch that the rectangle is actually the Type Hierarchy button bar, just unpainted.  (The buttons appear for one frame before the bar disappears.)  While the button bar is unpainted, it does not respond to mouse clicks or drags.

The button bar I am referring to contains the "Show the Type Hierarchy", "Show the Supertype Hierarchy", "Show the Subtype Hierarchy", and "Previous Type Hierarchies" buttons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Eclipse
2. Expand/collapse the Type Hierarchy view horizontally
3. View the modeless rectangle occlude other parts of the UI

Video showing the effect described in the bug

Subtle thing to notice in this video:  just before the button bar disappears, it paints.  Then, I think it is actually moving to live on the Type Hierarchy tab bar, to the right of the tabs.  That button bar also does something else funky when the tab bar whitespace gets too narrow, it moves back down to the button bar, but is right aligned.

In general I think that that Type Hierarchy bar just needs a little more testing and bulletproofing...
I can reproduce this easily using 3.8 M2 by placing the Type Hierarchy view below the Package Explorer, make it wide so that we get the horizontal layout and then restart.

Raksha, please investigate.
