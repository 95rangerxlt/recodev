I think that eclipse should in general have keyboard alternatives to all actions. However if due 
to time considerations we cannot do that, these are the following I think we should definately try 
to have

1) Keyboard alternative to Open Type action (from the toolbar)
2) Keyboard 
alternative to Search->References->Workspace (accessible via the right click menu)
3) 
Keyboard alternative to go directly to Outline view / Packages View / Navigation view (Not by 
pressing Ctrl-F7 - something similar to what F12 does for getting focus to the editor).

1) is available since some time (CTRL-SHIFT-T)

2) isn't there yet, and will be possible once we provide search actions to the 
menu bar. Migh current preference would be to offer search as part of the 
Navigate menu and to not have a top-level search menu. Dani pls wait 
implementing this until it was discussed with others.

3) is a workbench decision, given that the number of views is openended I 
consider the CTRL-F7 a good compromise, i.e., you can do it via the keyboard 
but not with one key (carboned Nick FYI) 


Re (3) We considered allowing Ctrl+Alt+??? shortcuts for views, but this has 
problems.
Ctrl+Alt combinations often collide with AltGr keys on non-English keyboards.
Also, we have difficulty managing the number of shortcut keys as it is.

Added shortcuts:
Ctrl+G       Search for declarations in workspace
Ctrl+Shift+G Search for references in workspace
