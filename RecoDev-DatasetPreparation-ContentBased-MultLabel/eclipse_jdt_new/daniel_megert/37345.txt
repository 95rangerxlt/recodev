1) create a javaElementFilters extension, but leave the markup in the 
plugin.xml incomplete

2) start-up the workbench
-> the package explorer doesn't come up

The reason is that the javaElementFilters extension point implementation fires 
an assertion when the xml isn't complete. This is not correct since this isn't 
a programming error. In addition, an error in the plugin.xml shouldn't never 
block the workbench from properly coming up.
