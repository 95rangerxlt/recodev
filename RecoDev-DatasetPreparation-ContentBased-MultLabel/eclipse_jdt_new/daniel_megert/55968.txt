i observed that the selected element is that element, that was selected before 
the new method was inserted (in my previous post this was the class, but 
it "works" with a method too)
The problem is that the magnet (highlight range) isn't updated correctly after
typing: the selection changed event is processed before the reconciler is done.

This is neither a regression (is also in M7) nor critical.

I fixed it in my workspace and will release directly after M8.
