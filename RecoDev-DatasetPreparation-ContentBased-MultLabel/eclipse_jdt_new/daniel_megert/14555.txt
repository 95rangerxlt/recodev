Build 20020418

- Open Type on String
- the outline shows 3 member types expanded
- I don't care about these 
- In this case they're private, but member types should not be expanded even 
if public.

If I want to see a member type, I'll expand it.

This only happens in binary types, not in source code.
*** Bug 18171 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This bug still exists in 2.1 RC2.  Any updates?

BTW, most developers have large pre-reqs.  Therefore the majority of classes 
are loaded as binary with attached source.
