Manifest and Build path

I'm trying to generate a runnable jar using Eclipse (Export->Java->Runnable JAR file). The JAR is generated correctly but the classpath key generated in the manifest file of this jar don't respect the libraries order fixed on my Build Path configuration. I have to change manually the manifest file because I need respect this order.

The Java BuildPath order in my Eclipse configuration is:

DynastyDM.jar dtgjxfsdevices.jar dsijxfs.jar jxfsclient2.1.3b.jar

The classpath key in the manifest file has the following value:

dtgjxfsdevices.jar jxfsclient2.1.3b.jar dsijxfs.jar DynastyDM.jar

¿What can I do for generating automatically the manifest file with the correct order?

Thanks

Proposed fix

Using a LinkedHashSet instead of a HashSet seem to fix the issue. Fix should be something like the attached patch.
Moving to JDT/UI for further action.
We can simply use ArrayList here and UnpackJarBuilder also needed a fix.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=b267310ff6f01b19cbf3707fafd9e85faaaea525

Won't there be a problem with duplicates? At the very least, we will end up printing the same entries multiple times in the manifest.

JDT Core allows to have the same JAR on the CP, so we shouldn't bother too much to remove the duplicates. However, UnpackJarBuilder.getManifestClasspath() still has code to do this.
