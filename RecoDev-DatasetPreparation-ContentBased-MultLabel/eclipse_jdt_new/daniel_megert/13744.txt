Ther jar export wizard creates since last integration build 20020412 a wrong

I have my sources in "src/" and the binaries in "bin/".

I think it is releated to bug: 13799

Please re-check your JAR aren't the files _twice_ in the JAR once with the
correct path and once with the wrong path?

If they aren't twice, what did you check:
[ ] Export generated class ....
[ ] Export java ...
[ ] Create source folder structure

> I think it is releated to bug: 13799

Don't know. The bug description is really short and like you can see 13799 is
newer than this submission.

Nope. If so it should be able to load the resource files which have the right
path... It looks like this: 

jarfile.jar:

SystemEnvironment.class 314          224  13.04.2002 17:57  com\project\util\
URLReader.class       1.086          629  13.04.2002 17:57  com\project\util\

> If they aren't twice, what did you check:

[X] Export generated class files and resources
[ ] Export java source files and resources

or

[X] Export generated class files and resources
[X] Export java source files and resources

no differences

> [ ] Create source folder structure

I do not have such an option in the jar export wizard of my integration build
20020412.

> [ ] Create source folder structure
This is on the second page but should be disabled if class files are generated.

Moving from P1 to P2. The problem is caused by the dot(s) in the name of the
resource folder.

Will have to investigate if it is caused by the exporter itself or by the Java
Model.


Combination of problems caused the bug. Most notably that the Java Model treats
folders with dots as non-java resources.

Fixed > 20020415 (released to todays integration build).
