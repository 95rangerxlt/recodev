We need to get "real" icons for bug 312159.
Setting target to M4 for ordering the icons. Delivery will probably during M5.
Please mention in the request that the proposed icons have been made similar to the existing org.eclipse.jdt.ui/icons/full/obj16/classfo_obj.gif and enum_alt_obj.gif, because the meaning is also similar:
"Problem that is not applicable any more, but its marker still exists" vs.
"Type that is not in the scope, but necessary to complete the hierarchy".
Icon request filed.
