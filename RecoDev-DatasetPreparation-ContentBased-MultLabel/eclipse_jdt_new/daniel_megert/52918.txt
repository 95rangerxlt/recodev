The types view (Java Browsing -> Types) does not reflect changes of the type
modifier.

Examlpe:   public class A {}.
- While removing the public modifier (change to default/package scope) the types
view still shows the class icon to be public. Even after saving and compiling it.

I consider it a bug.

which build id?
Needs to be investigated. I assume this has been introduced when removing to
workingcopy/original code in the JavaBrowsingContentProvider
I use the standard 3.0 M7 build. But this problem exists since the 2.0 release.
I filed an bug report some years (?) ago. Nothing happend so I just slammed on
the bushes again. :-) 

The old bug report seams to have gone (or marked as resolve) Don't know, can't
find it anymore. So I opened this one to get this anoying issus fixed. Normaly
after all tasks are aquired I do an extense refactoring session, playing around
with modifiers and stuff. That's what I've done just before I filed in this bug
report. I modified around a dozen types. And I got a bit angry about changing
the packages that often just to update the types view. :)


Thanks for taking care,

Martin (Kersten)
Can you please provide the bug number.

Can confirm bug in 3.0 M7.

>problem exists since the 2.0 release
I just tested it on R2.0 and it worked ;-) The problem is in all R2.1.x releases.
Well, I looked through all statments I have ever posted to the bugparade and I
couldn't find the older one. Seams I have used a diffrent email or something. It
was the first one I've ever reported and it was on a early milestone of 2.0. The
problem occures in R2.1.2 as well, but it seams to be correct in R2.1. 

I hope it is not that hard to fix.


Thanks,
