Build Identifier: 3.7 any

AS IS:
Since years Eclipse JDT offers automatic imports and package management (via various quick fixes/editor auto-save actions etc). Additionally, the "imports" node is collapsed by default in the Java editor.

TO BE:
It would be just consistent if outline view (and its "Quick" version opened via Ctrl+O) would hide *both* "packages" and "imports" elements by default - they currently just waste the space and in my understanding do not have any useful function anymore.

BTW quick outline already hides "imports" but not "packages" node, which makes no sense at all.

Reproducible: Always

Completely agree for the imports. I'll fix this in the 'Outline' and 'Members' view.

The package declaration is a bit different, as it allows to quickly see in which package one currently works. See also bug 82059 comment 2 for another explanation why we keep it.

I've adjusted the summary accordingly.

Dani,
I actually wanted to have *both* things to be hidden. Package can be seen by the breadcrumb on the top of the editor. I do not think that we should use Outline view as a placeholder for the package information - it is clearly more about navigation to something. I never "navigated" to the package. So we have package shown in Package explorer + breadcrumb + outline view => too much of same information. 
Should I open another bug for it?

I know ;-).

Nope. We are talking about the default behavior here. Like the package can be seen in the breadcrumb it can also be hidden in the Outline by changing the defaults. If we decide in the future to show the breadcrumb by default, then we would remove it from the Outline.

It's an outline of the CU. Some use it to navigate but some also use it to get a structural view of the CU.

Yes, please file one to have the breadcrumb shown by default and mention the package filters.
