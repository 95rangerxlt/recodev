Either the Best Match or the Annotation hover has to be enabled without key
modifier.

doesn't work here. best match is enabled without modifier, anotation with shift
modifier. neither work if above option is disabled. works fine if option
enabled. also, if the hovers were disabled the hover wouldn't work regardless of
what the option was.

you probalbly did not look to see what annotation was popping up. if the option
is disabled, it will (incorrectly) continue to pop up the javadoc hover if 'best
match' option is selected. it should pop up the warning/error annotation. if
'annotation' is selected there, it does nothing.


system:
  jre1.4.2
  winxp, latest updates
  I20030930

also same problem on my win2k box (if above option disabled)
not critical for M4.

it has been 3 weeks...is this being addressed? i don't know the code that well,
but it doesn't seem like it would require much effort to fix...
AnnotationHover was not using annotation access to get the type but directly
getMarkerType(). This does not work due to bug 41478.
