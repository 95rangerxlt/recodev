In the Eclipse 3.0 M3 java editor, I got the following NPE in the log file when 
I was either unindenting (using Shift-Tab) or formatting (using Ctrl-Shift-F) a 
selection of two methods.  I was zipping along coding and it happened so fast 
that I'm not sure which one caused the problem.  In addition, I cannot seem to 
reproduce the exception so I'm not sure how much help this is, but I thought 
that I'd report it anyway just in case.
