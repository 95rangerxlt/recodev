org.eclipse.jdt-feature doesn't have the PDE nature and builders for feature. See bug 237101.

The following should be added to the .project file:

        <buildSpec>
                <buildCommand>
                        <name>org.eclipse.pde.FeatureBuilder</name>
                        <arguments>
                        </arguments>
                </buildCommand>
        </buildSpec>
        <natures>
                <nature>org.eclipse.pde.FeatureNature</nature>
        </natures>

Moving to JDT/UI since they own this project
Let me do this.
Also fixed this in platform-feature.


Should add PDE nature and builder to jdt-feature
