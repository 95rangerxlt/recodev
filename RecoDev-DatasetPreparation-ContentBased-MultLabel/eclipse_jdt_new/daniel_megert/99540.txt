To reproduce:

Project -> Generate Javadoc -> Next -> Next ...
Now in the "Extra Javadoc options" put "-locale jp".  Click Finish.  Javadoc
complains that the "option -locale must be first on the command line," although
in fact it is the only argument.

Any news about it?
I have the same problem with Eclipse 3.4.2 (M20090211-1700).
Any workwaround ?

Thank you.
BTW, I tested with Helios Service Release 1 (20100917-0705) and got the same message: "javadoc: error - option -locale must be first on the command line."

I think it works if you enter it into the VM options field.
