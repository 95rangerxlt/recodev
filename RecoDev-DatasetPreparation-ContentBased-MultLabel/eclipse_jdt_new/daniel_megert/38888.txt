1. Either Javadoc or Declaration view open
2. position caret in a definition -> view shows corresponding content
3. Select part of the identifier using Shift+ARROW_LEFT/RIGHT or using the mouse
-> The editor update is really slowed down by the content resolvation for the 
views, because selection updates are not delayed when selecting.

I added a workaround for now (is in I20030617): only act on text selections with

Maybe the direct firing of text selection changes with length > 0 should be
reworked and implemented as we did it for 0-length selections.

Implementation is in place. Build > 20030701. Need further platform support.
