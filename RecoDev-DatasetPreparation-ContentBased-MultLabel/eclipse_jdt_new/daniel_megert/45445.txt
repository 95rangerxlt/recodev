Hovering over a local variable declaration/reference doesn't show a tooltip. 
JDT/Core now supports code select on local variable. UI side should be fixed to 
show the local variable declaration in a tooltip.
The tooltips show Javadoc.

Needs Core API to get the corresponding Javadoc since the current code uses
(IMember) API which is not available for ILocalVariable:

isBinary() -> could check whether parent is CU or CF
getClassFile() -> could use getCompilationUnit() -> need to use parent chain
getSourceRange() -> *** missing ***

We need support from Core to show the Javadoc for local variables.

Partially fixed: the name shows up now
There isn't such a thing as javadoc for local variables. 
Wouldn't you also need: #getTypeSignature() in order to synthesize the text 
shown in hover ? Or is the source range all you need.
This bug is about JDT/Text not showing tooltips for local variables.
Moving back to JDT/Text to complete fix.

Please enter separate request(s) against JDT/Core if you need more 
functionality.
I fixed the Javadoc tooltip which can only show the name (according to comment 2).

Jerome, since you filed the feature request I expected that J Core is ready to
implement it. I thought the easiest would be to transfer this to you with the
stuff we need (at least source range for the source hover). Anyway filed a new
feature request.
.
We thought we were ready :-) Anyway I think it is better to focus a bug report 
on one problem. Entering separte bugs makes it easier (at least for us) to find 
out why a change was made later on. 

For getting the source range, for now you can cast an ILocalVariable to 
ISourceReference. For next integration build I will change ILocalVariable to 
extend ISourceReference.
If you send me a preview I can fix it on Monday's fix pass
Preview posted at http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-
core-home/r3.0/main.html#updates
I20031105 also contains the requested features. Should this bug be reopened?
I did not have time to finish it for last I-build but it's on my radar :-)

Added type to Javadoc hover
Added source hover.
