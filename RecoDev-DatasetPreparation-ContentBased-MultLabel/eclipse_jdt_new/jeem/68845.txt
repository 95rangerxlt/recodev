For convenience it would be good add 'resolveBinding' to AbstractTypeDeclaration
as all subclasses of AbstractTypeDeclaration have a 'resolveBinding', otherwise
the workaround 'AbstractTypeDeclaration.getName().resolveBinding()' has to be used.

Jim, could you please handle this one?
Added to AbstractTypeDeclaration:
public final ITypeBinding resolveBinding().

This is a non-breaking API addition since API methods with the same signature 
already existed on the subclasses.

Fixed in 1.5 stream. Build notes updated.
