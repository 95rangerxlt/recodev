It would be nice if the AST Nodes could be distiguished by an int 'type'-id
like IJavaElement.getElementType / IResource.getType
- instanceof checks can be reduced.
- needed to implement a switch statement over many node types
- nice to find a parent of a certain kind

Jim, could you please have a look at this PR?
Added ASTNode.getNodeType() and constants on ASTNode.
Constants are small, unique, positive numbers, suitable for use in switch
statements.

Test suites updated.



DCR: ASTNode.getElementType



Add ASTNode.getNodeType and constants. Bug #13084
