3.8.

In the special case where source folder == output folder == project, we show the source when opening the class file from the output folder. This is not good.

Yes, I know this code was added on request, but it is wrong.

Test fix

The test that was previously added as part of fix for bug 41444 needs to be either removed or altered.

The question I have is, what is the problem with the way things currently are? I agree we are doing something that we probably don't have to do. But is that, by itself, a problem in any way?

1. I can't open the byte code (class file editor)
2. All other cases are not handled (e.g. in our default setup with src/bin)
3. The source is cached (which is good) but then obviously fails if the source
   is changed.

Sorry, that I didn't run the tests.

Thanks for explaining!
All other tests pass and I have released the fix along with the test in master.
Forgot to change the status.
Verified in I20130122-0800.
The commits to be cherry-picked to R3_8_maintenance are here:

We also have to update the bundle versions.
...and we need to manually tag and update the map file.
Back ported the changes to R3_8_maintenance and incremented the MANIFEST version too. Map files are still pending as there is one more possible candidate for 3.8.2+.

Dani, do you think it's better to just tag instead of waiting to include bug 395897?

Just tag now, so that this bug can be closed.

You forgot to update the map file. Fixed now with http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.maps.git/commit/?id=a0ff47508cb8a161f2c94a6859b5ebbb7023b7af

Actually, I was waiting for a decision on the other bug too.
