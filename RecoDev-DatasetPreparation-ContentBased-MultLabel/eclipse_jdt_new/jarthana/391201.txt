BETA_JAVA8:

The following program when built as a 1.7- project but built against
a 1.8 JRE compiles fine. It should not as it uses type annotations.

// -----------
public class X< T> {
	@Marker int foo() {
		return 0;
	}
}

@java.lang.annotation.Target (java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Marker {
}

Proposed fix

This patch contains fix for this bug and bug 391196, bug 391314 and bug 391315.

New tests have been added and some existing tests have been rewritten for bug 391314. The new test AnnotationTest.testBug391201() fails in 1.8 compliance level. I still have to find an appropriate place that only runs below 1.8.

Srikanth, please review.
Here are some comments:

    - Let us merge messages 649 and 652 into one:
"Annotation types that don't specify explicit target element type cannot be applied here" and

    - merge the two methods explitAnnotationTargetRequired and
explitAnnotationTargetRequired2 into the former itself.

    - These two changes allow us to get rid of IProblem and CompilerInvocationTests changes.

    - AnnotationTest#testBug391201 should be moved to ComplianceDiagnoseTest

This test should not be run on 1.8+

    - Expected message for 1.7- is wrong, it should print a message saying
type annotations are illegal at source below 1.8
