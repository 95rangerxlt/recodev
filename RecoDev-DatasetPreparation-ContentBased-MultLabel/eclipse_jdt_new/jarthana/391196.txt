BETA_JAVA8:

The following program should compile, but does not. (note that javac also
erroneously reports one error, while we report 2 more):

// ----
@Marker public class X {
	@Marker public int foo(){
		Object o = (@Marker String) null;
	}
}

@java.lang.annotation.Target (java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Marker {
}

Per EDR section 2.3:

"A type annotation (one meta-annotated with @Target(ElementType.TYPE USE)) 
is permitted to be written anywhere @Target(ElementType.TYPE) or 
@Target(ElementType.TYPE PARAMETER) would permit—that is, on a class,
interface, or enum declaration, or on a type parameter declaration."

Also

"A type annotation may appear before a constructor, in which case it 
represents the object that the constructor is creating (which is not 
the same as the receiver of the constructor)."

Fix should go in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.Annotation.resolveType(BlockScope)

public class X<@Marker T> {
	@Marker X() {
	}
}

@java.lang.annotation.Target (java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
