R3.6.2+J7

Backport VerifyError fixes.
Here is the list of bugs that need to be back-ported to both R3_7_maintenance and R3_6_maintenance_Java7:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=381172
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=394718
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380927
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380750

The last one (bug 380750) is not a verify error but a regression from bug 359495, which was a verify error. The actual fix was back-ported to R3_7 and R3_6_Java7 but not this regression.

This is only the list of bugs that had "VerifyError" in the summary. I will update the list if I find more bugs.
One more to the list:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380313

This might be a bit more tricky since it may depend on fix for bug 368546, which seems to have lot of changes.
The list of bugs from comment 1 looks reasonable.

Bug 380313 should only be backported if the fix is small i.e. for sure we don't want to drag in the whole fix for bug 368546.

To my disappointment, I just found that none of these address the test case reported in bug 381172, comment 27, when back-ported to R3_7_maintenance. Will investigate.

It appears the fix made for bug 380313 would address the test case mentioned. As I had feared, the fix for bug 368546 and bug 380313 seem to be interlocked. I will see if I can isolate the fixes.
I have released the fixes for the following bugs in R3_7_maintenance:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=381172
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=394718
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380927
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380750
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380313

These have been released via commits in range:

2d77ae6250b9fb38d19c6ba07f99c88fa5be8b9a .. 717db8fa79fc97053409e213e5f97d888166773e

The commit range also includes the fix for bug 346010, to make all tests pass.

I am in the process of back-porting them for R3_6_maintenance_Java7.

Done. The commit range is:

650d34a55f295affa1498bddd4cfe460109baef3 .. b6acf0036c34cc60917f0ce83abc2a7122636290

R3_6_maintenance_Java7 stream has been tagged and the map file has been updated.
 
Dani, now that we no longer have maintenance builds off R3_7_maintenance, should I do the same for that branch as well?

I have tagged and updated the map file for R3_7_maintenance branch also, just in case.
