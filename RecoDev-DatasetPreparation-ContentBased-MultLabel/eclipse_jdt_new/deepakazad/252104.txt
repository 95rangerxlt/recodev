See the following snippet:
-------------
package p;

public class B {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		switch(getFoo() ? getBar() : getBar()) {
		case 1:
			System.out.println();
			break;
		}
	}

	private static int getBar() {
		return 0;
	}

	private static boolean getFoo() {
		return false;
	}
}
------

Using the "Convert switch to if/else" quick assist fails to add the correct parentheses to the expression.
After the quick assist is done there are currently two quick fixes:
* add cast to boolean
* Insert null check
In this case these two quick fixes are not really useful as we don't come closer to a compilable output.
