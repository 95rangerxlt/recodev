Win 7 and Eclipse 4.2 (I20110916-1615). In the past I have also seen this on Linux, but I think this used to work correctly on Win XP.

See attached screenshot.
Not a OS specific issue, this depends on which JRE is used - 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, Oracle, IBM. On my Win 7 machine, this works fine with IBM JDK 1.5 and Oracle JDK 1.7, but does not work with IBM JDK 1.6.

The current behavior depends on the order of notification in java.util.Observable.notifyObservers(Object), which is different in different JREs. The javadoc of Observable class also says "The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified."

Hence, the right fix is to not rely on the order of notification, which is quite simple to do.

Fixed in HEAD. Commit - c1839c46b38bc8d387d9b5cd4408c694d4c413c7
