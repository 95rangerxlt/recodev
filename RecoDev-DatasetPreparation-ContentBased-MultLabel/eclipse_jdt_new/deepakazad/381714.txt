Deepak, at this point we'd only add doc, but not change the code to add the help context ID.
I added the doc via
http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=5ccd6fa8dd31f930e1758d0e0ea2dd88b481e7ea

Let me know if the doc should have more details.

Dani, we will keep this bug open to add the help context id right after 3.8 release?
