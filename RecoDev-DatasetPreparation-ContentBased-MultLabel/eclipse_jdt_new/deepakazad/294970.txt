In strings use the name/label when there is just one element/thing
e.g. "Move method 'foo()' to X" instead of "Move method to X"

fix

Updated 15 strings.

Also, I noticed now that I had made a mistake in patch for bug 266094 in ReorgPolicyFactory.java. The singular strings were something like "Move source folder to ''{1}''" (there was no {0}), and I was not passing any parameters for even {1}. Fixed these problems in this patch.

Good catch!

For the changes in ui refactoring/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/refactoring I don't like that you removed and count/length variables and instead use 'lenght' twice. Please leave those as is (but use the new local variable that holds the elements).

Committed the other changes of the patch to HEAD with two little changes:
NewSourceFolderWizardPage
 - instead of using toArray() I used iterator().next()
 - remove makeRelative().toString() as this is not needed
