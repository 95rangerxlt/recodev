Build ID: N20090422-2000

Steps To Reproduce:
Using the code provided below in a JDT editor window:

1. Hilight the expression within the first if conditional (with == operator).
2. Open "Quick Fix" (I use Ctrl+1)
3. Note "Exchange left and right operands..." item is available and works as expected.
4. Hilight the expression within the second if conditional (with != operator).
5. Open "Quick Fix"
6. Note "Exchange left and right operands..." item is NOT available.


Sample Code:

        Object o = new Object();

        if (o == null) {

        }

        if (o != null) {

        }


More information:
I've thought about it a little (and searched for prior reported bugs on the issue) and can't think of a technical reason that exchanging operands around != would be different to doing so around ==, but there may be something I haven't thought of.

For now, my workaround is to either edit manually or apply "Invert Conditions", "Exchange Operands" and "Invert Conditions" quick fixes, in that order.  The first will of course convert != to == allowing Exchange Operands to be used.
