Open Assert.java
Change the constructor to "Asserts"
Select "Asserts" in the editor
Execute an action which uses the Java element from the selection (Rename or Ctrl+H)
Note that the same actions work if started from the Outline view.

first guess is that this is a core problem related to code select.
This scenario is a selection of method with missing return type.
Need to apply some fuzzy method lookup since the binding cannot be created.
Fixed.


Code resolve does not work for changed constructor
