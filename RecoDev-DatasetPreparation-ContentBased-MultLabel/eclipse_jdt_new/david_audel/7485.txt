1. create (A.java)
 import java.util.Vector;
 public class A {
   public A(Vector v) {
   }
 }
(B.java)
 public class B extends A {
 }

2. in the outliner on B, choose 'Add constructors from superclass'
  Constructor is added but no import for Vector.

3. Dio it again but set a breakpoint in JavaModelUtil.getResolvedTypeName. 
   It is called to resolve type name 'Vector' in A.
   No results.
