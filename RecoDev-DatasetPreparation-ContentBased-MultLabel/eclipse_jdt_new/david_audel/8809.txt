Create J project J with class folder X that has JUnit class files
Create J project B with X on build path
Create a new class in B:
public class JTest {
 junit.framework.
}
I started code assist and it worked up to packages but failed on the types.

Should be an issue in the namelookup/searchable environment.
Code assist call SearchEngine to find type.
JavaSearchScope use the index file of the project instead of the index file of 
the class folder.

Fixed


Code assist with class folders does not work
