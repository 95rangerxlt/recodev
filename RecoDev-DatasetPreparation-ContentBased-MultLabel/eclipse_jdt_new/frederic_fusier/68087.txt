I have a doclet comment of the following:

/**
 * @abc.def-ghi name="xyz"
 */

Using the AST apis to parse this comment and add it to the BodyDeclaration I 
notice that its org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.Javadoc instance contains the 
org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.TagElement with name as abc.def and not as abc.def-ghi 
as I would have hoped.

'-' is not a valid tag name character as Javadoc tool reject this kind of tag:
warning - @abc.def-ghi is an unknown tag.
even if you add tag option:
-tag "abc.def-ghi"
How can this be true????
XDoclet has the following ejb class level tags and there are many of them with 
a '-' character in them.

@ejb Class Level Tags

@ejb.bean

@ejb.dao

@ejb.data-object

@ejb.ejb-external-ref

@ejb.ejb-ref

@ejb.env-entry

@ejb.facade

@ejb.finder

@ejb.home

@ejb.interface

@ejb.persistence

@ejb.pk

@ejb.remote-facade

@ejb.resource-env-ref

@ejb.resource-ref

@ejb.security-identity

@ejb.security-role-ref

@ejb.util

@ejb.value-object

I think this defect needs more investigation because the '-' is a very common 
annotation separator.

Current behavior try to match behavior of javadoc.exe tool with *standard*
doclet. So, XDoclet is surely a specific doclet which can make javadoc to accept
dashes in tag names, but the initial intention of Javadoc support in compiler
was only to match standard usage of Javadoc tool...

So, keep this bug open for a further investigation but raise down severity to
enhancement...
Deferred post 3.0
Reopen to assign...
Deferred post 3.0
Candidate for 3.0.1
We'll set '-' character to be valid in tag names as it seems to be really often
used in specific doclets...
Fixed.

For 3.0.1, we only fix the problem for dash character and make it available in
tag names. We'll see if we have time for 3.1 to specify doclet tag names...

[jdt-core-internal]
Change done in AbstractCommentParser.parseComment(int,int).
Test cases added in JavadocTestMixed and ASTConverterJavadocTest.

Released in HEAD.
Verified for 3.0.1 RC1
