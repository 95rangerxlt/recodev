Although it was not specified in Javadoc 1.4 spec, this syntax is accepted by
javadoc tool and so compiler should not complain about it...
Fixed.

Now skip all text between href string and closing '>'. That means that syntax of
additional parameter(s) for link reference is not verified...

Change done in AbstractCommentParser.parseHref() method.
Test cases added in JavadocTestMixed and ASTConverterJavadocTest.
