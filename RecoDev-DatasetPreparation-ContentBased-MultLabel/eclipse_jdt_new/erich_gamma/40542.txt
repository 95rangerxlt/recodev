In addition to showing the test method name, it should prefix it with the class 
name. The test hierarchy shows this information, but the animation time penalty 
is quite bad, and for big suites, it is not a viable alternative.

Just to clarify.

Currently, JUnit shows the class name but behind the method name:

testSomething(TestPackage)

but when iterating across test, the trailing portion moves a lot and thus isn't 
readable. Since it is more stable that the test method name, it should be 
displayed before:

TestPackage#testSomething

released fix with some tweaks (avoid duplicating extracting testclass/method, 
a different rendering)
