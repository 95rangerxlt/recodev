Build 20021119
Linux-GTK

It looks like the text in the copy/paste buffer is getting trimmed.

1. Highlight the text "private " (including a space at the end) in an editor
2. Hit ctrl+c to copy
3. Hit ctrl+v to paste
4. The text that is pasted is not the text that was copied. The space is
missing.

Verified in Build I20021126. Whitespaces at the beginning and the end of the 
text selection are eaten away (including tabs, spaces).

Veronika to investigate and advise

Have you tried pasting to a different application?  I am wondering if 
StyledText is doing the trimming or the Clipboard. I will run a sinple SWT 
application to check. Do you know if this behaviour just started appearing in 
1119?
Happens on Windows as well.  This seems to be a StyledText or Text problem.  
Referring to Lynne and Knut.
Maybe it is actually a JDT 'feature'?
- copying selection with whitespaces from notepad to native Text or StyledText 
in ControlExample or in a text editor work.
- in a java editor, whitespaces get eaten away
Problem just occurring in the Java Editor.  Copy from an editor other than the 
Java Editor, then paste into a Java Editor.  Leading/trailing whitespace is 
removed.  Reassigning to JDT.
moving to JDT Text for investigation
Smart paste can be switched off: Preferences>Java>Editor>Typing.
It also looks like the original bug was fixed. If I copy text with a space at
the end in the Java editor, the space is no longer lost.
