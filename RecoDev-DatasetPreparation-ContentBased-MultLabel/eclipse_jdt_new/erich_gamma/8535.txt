I select any method in the outline-view. 
In the editor, the method is marked, but they don't moved automatically 
in the visible area.

The problem exists only at watching class-files (i.e. from the JDK)
I use eclipse-gtk 20020125.
The problem doesn't exists in the motif-version.

Correction:

The problem is exists, if the editor-pane-tab is selected, then for 
all open files, not only class-files.
If i activate another component and click then into the editor-pane
(not the editor-pane-tab), then is the method correct viewed.
Fixed in 2.0 stream.
