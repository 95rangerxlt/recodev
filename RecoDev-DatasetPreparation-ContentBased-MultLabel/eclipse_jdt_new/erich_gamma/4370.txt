The package viewer uses "tight" overlay icons. This makes the green overlay 
for "abstract" ('A') hard to read on the green class icon. I suggest to add a 
single row of white pixels at the bottom of the 'A' so that it no longer blends 
into the green class icon. I'm not asking for increasing the width of the icon.

still a problem in 20020214
why is the packages view icon different from the outliner icon?

MA owns the label providers - moving to his box
it's the 'small_icons' flags that is the difference.
packages viewer has to decide if it should change to normal icons.


can't change to wide 24x16 icons. Platform icons are 16x16 and this would 
result in stretched platform icons.

Asking Andree for help.
