Elements contained in a file (i.e., classes, methods) shouldn't have a version 
label since you can only version files.
When a changed file is released the version label for elements contained in a 
file and displayed in the package viewer is not updated. It remains the 
scratched version label. Ideally these elements would not have a version label 
in the first place.
