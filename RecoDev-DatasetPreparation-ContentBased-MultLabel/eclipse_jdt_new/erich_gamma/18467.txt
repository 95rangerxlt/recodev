The Filters... item on the view menu has a radio bullet, even though there are 
no other items in this group to choose from.
it is used to indicate that there is an active filter. Otherwise there is no 
indication whether there is a filter active.
Usually a radio bullet indicates a 1 of N choice.
To indicate whether something is active or not, recommend using a checkbox.
However, usually a checkbox item simply toggles state, and does bring up extra 
UI.
Could have two items:
- Enable Filters (check with simple toggle behaviour)
- Configure Filters (no check, enabled only when Enable Filters is checked)

I think having two items will confuse the user. I opt to use a check box 
instead of a "radio" button.
Agree with Dirk. Changed RADIO to CHECK
