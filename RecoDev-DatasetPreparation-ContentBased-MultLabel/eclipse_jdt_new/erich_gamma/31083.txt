The JRE System Library container shows up at the bottom of my project's 
children, where it is actually ordered first on my build path.

This feels inconsistent with our approach of sticking to the build path.
A sort of regression, since this worked with the flat structure.

Erich, any comments ?
Currently the logic container is treated as a non-Java resource and appears at 
the end (this is the IJavaElement discussion we had).

The sorting in class path order is very subtle and users tend to be confused 
about our odering. It is not immediatly apparent that this is the class path 
order. 

There is an issue in that we are not consistent currently. There are two 
options:
1) give up the class path ordering and sort the packagefragment roots 
alphabetically
2) change our sorter so that it understands the synthetic ClassPathContainer 
element.

I suggest to do 1)

I think users could be given a choice. Personnally, I prefer the classpath 
ordering. In case of patching, users get a visual clue of which fragments are 
hidden.
There is the issue that we are currently inconsistent (i.e., a Jar is sorted 
differently than the logic container).

Fixed the code so that the logic container is sorted according to the class 
path.
