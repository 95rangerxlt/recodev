Steps to reproduce

Unzipped both the SDK and samples in the same directory.
Created a simple project and inserted a test.jav file.
Trigger code assist with a period.
Select any entry and hit the enter key.

Result: Black Screen

Environment:
I am using the 20020125 build with SUNs 1.3.1 JDK on Win2000 sp2

Point of Note
 I have managed to get things working (except for one strange anomaly) by
updating the sample code to be more in line with that used by the IDE's Java
Editor. In the production editor the validate instantiated by the
CompletionProcessor  implements  IContextInformationPresenter in addition to
IContextInformationValidator.
 The anomaly is that the validator in not installed until an item is first 
selected from the proposals popup. This means that the validator is not active 
the first time the popup appears. Once the code assist popup is initialized 
with the validator it looses it if for instance the escape key is pressed while 
the popup is visable.

What I thought was an anomaly with the way the valuator operates once the 
IContextInformationPresenter interface is implemented is in fact intended 
behavior.  It was my understanding of what should be happening that was wrong.


This is not PDE.
This has been resolved in 2.0
