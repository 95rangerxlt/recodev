I wanted to create a new TestCase for JUnit by using the New TestCase Wizard.
I get the error message "Superclass does not implement 
the 'junit.framework.Test' interface".
I have included junit.jar into my project.

I wanted to create a new TestCase for JUnit by using the New TestCase Wizard.

works for me.

Please provide detailed steps and provide the build number you are using.
Details:
I am using Eclipse Version: 2.1.1 Build id: 200306271545.
In the package explorer I click with the right mouse button onto the package 
that contains all my tests. Then I choose New | Other | Java,JUnit,TestCase.
In the field 'Superclass' appears the string 'junit.framework.TestCase' and in 
the error status appears the message 
'Superclass does not implement the 'junit.framework.Test' interface'.

The junit.jar file is included and all my tests run and keep my bar green.
The scenario below works for me in 3.0 M5. 
There was a problem in the initialization of the class name. I've addressed 
this in the 3.0 stream, problem isn't critical enough to back port to 2.1


superclass does not implement the 'junit.framework.Test' interface [JUnit]
