Build 20030122 + pde junit 2.1.3

When developping tests, I tried to run them using run as Junit plugin test. 
Given I was editing a test method, it picked up this one method only for run.

Could not figure how to change the launch config to tell it to run the entire 
test suite instead.

Currently you cannot not.
Need to revisit whether the text selection based test selection behaviour is 
desirable.
removed the text selectioin based test case selection


Junit plugin test - cannot edit launch config to remove individual test [JUnit]
