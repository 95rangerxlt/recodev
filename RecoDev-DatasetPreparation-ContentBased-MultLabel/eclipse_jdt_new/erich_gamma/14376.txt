There are red X on Java project, packages if they contain an error class.
However, there is no red X on the class itself.  Why?
works for me please provide a reproducable test case with detailed steps and 
describe in which views the red X does not show.
1. In Java perspective, create a java project JP1
2. Create package jp1 under JP1
3. Create a class T.java and ERASE its entire content and save it
4. You should get an error "The declared package does not match the expected 
package jp1" in the Tasks, but the class T.java does not marked with red X.

P.S. I inherited this workspace from another person and I don't know why there
are a few empty files.  However, I was trying to identify them by the red X but 
I couldn't.

I introduced a bug with errorticks on projects.
