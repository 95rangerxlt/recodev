Deselting all children automatically deselects its container.
This prevents the creation of a working set only consisting of the folder, but 
not its subfolder.

Selecting a folder should only gray a parent folder, but not select it.

Yup, is a problem is someone wants to see all files in a folder but not sub 
folders in it.
it is now possible to create a Java specific working set and you can create a 
working set for an inner package only.

What you still cannot do is to define a working set that consists of the 
default package only (when project=src folder). In this case you also get the 
non-Java resources that are shown as children of the project. This is because 
the default package and the project folder map to the same underlying resource. 
This limitation is acceptable, pls reopen if you disagree.
