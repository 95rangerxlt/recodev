Hello,
 
this message is related to the "news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.tools"-thread:
      "My Problems with Projects, Source- and Classpathes"
 
What I do to deal with eclipses rebuild-problems is: I use Linux
Konquerer to search and delete all class files in my workspace and then I
recompile "Workbench->Rebuild All" with eclipse 
(a few times until all errors are gone). 
The wanted menuitem should do exatly that, i.e. no denpendency
checking or other complcated calculation (approximatly 30 lines off
code).

This is not as useless as it sounds, because 1 or 2 classes are
sometimes compiled with errors, but a regular "Workbench->Rebuild All"
shows no errors.
 
I can't make this a real report because it is very hard to find a
small reproducable example. But I have every week a handful of such
examples (they are reproducable but not small).
Perhaps somebody can confirm this.
 
My Konqueror method now becomes unhandy because now the ".metadata"
folder in the workspace has class-files too (what do they do there??),
and I'm always in danger to delete them.

I got into a similar state recently.  At some point, I changed my output
folder from being the project itself to a /bin subdirectory.  Later,
invocations of "rebuild all" showed no errors in the UI, but I would get
compilation error messages at runtime.  Finally, I realized that I had
.class files for some of the same classes in both the project directory and
the /bin subdirectory, and "rebuild all" was only scrubbing the /bin
directory (since that was the current location).  I had to use Windows
explorer to delete all .class files in all the project's directories, and
voila, problem solved.

In short, such a feature would be nice (though might be difficult to name or
explain).
At the point the binary output is changed, UI might want to propose to flush 
pre-existing class files in previous location.

Moving to UI

this looks like a bug, if you have a reproducable case pls file it against JDT 
core. 

I agree with Philippe that the UI should be more supportive when the user 
changes the output folder. I expect it will be common that users start with a 
simple project layout (output= project) and as the project grows they migrate 
to use source folders. 
jdt-ui does not know which files it could delete (difficult when the previous 
location was the project). JCore could do this on setOutputLocation.

or I need an API flushOutputLocation that I would call before setting the new 
output location.

I don't think you would need anything more than 'flush all classfiles'. 

Note that any CLASS file in this folder would be ignored anyway, so if there 
was any, it better go away. If you want to be conservative, then you could 
discard all GENERATED ones (those tagged as  such).
when the output folder location changes we are now prompting the user whether 
class files should be removed.


Please add a menu-item "Workbench->Delete all classfiles"
