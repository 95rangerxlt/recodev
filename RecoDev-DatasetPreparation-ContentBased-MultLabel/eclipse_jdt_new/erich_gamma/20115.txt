which version?

Cannot reproduce it in 20020611. If you can reproduce please provide detailed 
information about the selection/cursor position when this has happened.
I am using F3. This problem does not happen on F2.
It happens even if the file has already been formatted.
It happens on any file.

If for example I take a file that is out of shape.
94:17 is my pre-format cursor position and the editor
window is showing that line in the middle of its window.
Then I issue a  Source | Format command. 93:29 is my
position now which is correct, however the editor window
now shows the beginning of the file. There are two
cases that I tried afterwards:

1) Since the cursor is located at the correct position,
pressing any arrow keys take me back to the correct view
but shows the line at the bottom of the editor window.

2) If I keep pressing page-down until the end of the
file the scroll bar marker does not reach the bottom
of its window, instead it hangs somewhere above since
page view and cursor information are out of sync.


The same for me, F3 at WinNt4.0, running jdk131_3 and jdk140_1

patch for SourceViewer
The problem has been introduced in F3 with a change in the translation of 
document events into StyledText text events (see #15159). This change causes 
the widget to scroll.

If not fixed: User looses context when formating.
Low risk change. See attachment.
