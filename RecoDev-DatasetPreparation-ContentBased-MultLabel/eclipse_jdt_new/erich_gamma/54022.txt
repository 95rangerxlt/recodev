I find the fastview shortcut bar to be the biggest waste of space in the 
workbench.  At last, this bar disappears when it is not in use, but the 
default Java perspective brings it back by placing JUnit as a fast view.

AFAIK, this is the only case of default perspectives defining fast views.  
Would you consider removing it or stacking it somewhere. Better yet, open it 
as a fast view, but don't open the view until I launch a JUnit test. i.e., 
remove it from the perspective.

thanks.

I like the fast bar...
the 'fastview' bar, of course.
The problem is that you cannot define a placeholder for a fast view. This 
means the fast views is always showing up and this is a problem.

rolled back to stacking on top of the package explorer.
