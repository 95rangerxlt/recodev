Sorry, I wasn't sure where to put search plugin PRs.

The searchPages extension point documentation says you must supply
a class that implements IDialogPage.  It actually must implement ISearchPage.
If you just implement IDialogPage, it fails at runtime with a ClassCastException.
Doc needs to be updated.

NOTES:

	Search provided by ZRH. 

DM (9/21/01 9:32:23 AM)
	Fixed > 0.200
