I asked SN:
	We did a quick test of our stuff (JDT, Compare) under a German, Hebrew, and Japanese system.
	One problem we found is that we format (that is basically line-break) Java-doc comments in a hover window.
	However because comments may contain non-roman text we cannot simply break lines at whitespaces.
	Since we don't want to learn how to do that for all possible scripts here my question:
	Does SWT provide a way to "linebreak" a (Unicode, that is Java-) string?
	(Or is there a widget that can do the linebreaking and rendering?)

Answer from SN:
	Hey!  Carolyn believes that the class BreakIterator will do what you want.
	She's just about to use it to do some printing thing.  She says it looks good
	on paper.

	Also Label and Text with SWT.WRAP should work too but StyledText will
	not because it has no wrapping code.

NOTES:
