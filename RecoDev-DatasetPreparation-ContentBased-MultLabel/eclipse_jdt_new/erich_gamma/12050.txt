Build 20020214

In the Hierarchy View, there's a 'Previous Hierarchy Inputs' button.  It is an 
arrow pointing to the right.  This is confusing, since both IE and Netscape 
Navigator use an arrow pointing to the left for 'previous'.

I suggest that this arrow should be reversed to be consistent with IE, and with 
the normal expectations of English readers.
