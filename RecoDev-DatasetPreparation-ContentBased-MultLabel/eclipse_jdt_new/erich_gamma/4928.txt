build 204

I sometimes want to show the Navigator in the Java perspective.
It currently opens over the outline.
I would prefer it to open over the packages view, since they're of the same 
flavour and I usually want one or the other, not both at the same time.
It also means my flow still goes from left to right: choose something in the 
Navigator or packages view, it appears in the editor and outline view to the 
right.
