When a TestSuite name contains a comma, the tree is rendered wrong.
Apparently the comma is interpreted as "tree-node-end", meaning: the TestCases 
in the TestSuite is rendered on an adjecent tree-node and NOT in the actual 
parent TestSuite.

Example in attached screenshot:
The "No comman" screenshot shows a TestSuite named "All tests" containing the 2 
TestSuites "TestSuite 1" and "TestSuite 2".
In the "Comma in name" screenshot, "TestSuite 1" is renamed to "TestSuite, 1".

Comma in name
Since it is a corner case (commas are typically not used in names) this is time 
permitted for 2.1 
import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class AllTests {

	public static Test suite() {
		TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("Test");
		suite.addTestSuite(TestCase.class);
		return suite;
	}
}

Will run and will state:
" junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: No tests found in junit.framework.TestCase"

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class AllTests {

	public static Test suite() {
		TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("Test,");
		suite.addTestSuite(TestCase.class);
		return suite;
	}
}

Notice the , after Test in constructor -> will not run at all.
works in Swing-Runner so it's a problem with JUnit view.
Reproducable w/ TestCase names containing a ,

import junit.framework.Test;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import junit.framework.TestSuite;

public class AllTests extends TestSuite {

	public static Test suite() {
		class CommaTest extends TestCase {
			public CommaTest() {
				super(",");
			}
		}
		
		CommaTest test = new CommaTest();

		TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();
		suite.addTest(test);
		return suite;
	}
}

Problem stems from client-server communication.

Server sends a csv string to the client.

One solution would be to escape , in the server message with tabs \t

But in that case tabs would not be allowed in the name; who would do this btw ;)

fix

Instead of escaping to \t I escape to \u0000

I think is highly unlikely that someone will embed Unicode NULL into his
TestCase/TestSuite name.
