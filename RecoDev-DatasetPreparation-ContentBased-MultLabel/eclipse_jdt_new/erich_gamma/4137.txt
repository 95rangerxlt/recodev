From Eclipse Corner: JavaDoc niggles

4) The way of displaying the documentation itself is a bit ugly - I see 
that *some* HTML is noticed (eg <br>) but other stuff isn't (eg <i>). I 
realise this may be due to this nature of whatever's displaying the 
docs. Also, just displaying the @param etc tags isn't nearly as nice as 
laying out the parameters properly, as I believe some other IDEs do. My 
guess is that this bit is still a work in progress, but I thought I'd 
raise it anyway :)

NOTES:
	CM (8/22/2001 10:55:00 AM)
		Should at least align the @param nicely.

EG (8/31/2001 10:52:43 AM)
	To properly address this requires a HTML renderer. Help has a 
	similar request.
