If a label update event comes to the ProblemTreeViewer whose element is an 
IResource the update does not occur as handleLabelProviderChanged
(LabelProviderChangedEvent event)checks for an item by equality and does not 
handle the case where a resource is the element for an event but objects that 
adapt to resources are being shown.

In the case of the ProbemTreeViewer java objects are being shown. When 
handleLabelProviderChanged the event element may be a resource which the 
regular TreeViewer would not find. ProbemTreeViewer will have to handle this 
case.

This is currently an issue for the CVS Decorator as this it sends updates for a 
specific resource.

*** Bug 8782 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
in build 20020212 implemented mapping back of IResource to IJavaElement
Mapping doesn't handle default package properly yet.
There is a separate bug for this issue.
