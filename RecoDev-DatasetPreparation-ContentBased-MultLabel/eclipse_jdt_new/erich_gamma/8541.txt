Workbench -> Preferences -> Debug -> Java Debug Option

I change from one preference-point to the next, the window 
is resizing.
At Java Debug Option, the window resized the height too strong.
The buttom of the window ended outside the monitor.
Two centimetre height would help and all information are
still displayed.

I use eclipse-gtk 20020125.
