3.0M4

when i run a test case and it fails because of a failed assertEquals(String,
String), then an option could be given to click in the view and open a compare
viewer to compare the 2 strings.

this would make this tedious taks much much simpler and it would give a nice
leverage to our compare infrastructure.

there is now support to inspect a test failure with a custom compare dialog
very cool. thanks.

it could be probably a bit more exposed so that people realise it's there


open compare viewer for string equals failures [JUnit]
