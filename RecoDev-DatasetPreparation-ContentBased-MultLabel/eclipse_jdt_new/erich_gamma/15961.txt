Fresh workspace. Import all plug-ins from the runtime Eclipse. Compile 
problems show up in all UI plug-ins that have fragments. The solution is to 
delete all these plug-ins and import one at a time. Plug-ins first followed by 
the fragments.

The above work-around does not really work. It gets rid of the errors but does 
not seem to load the SWT classes so self-hosting is impossible if you use any 
UI. 
Confirmed. This looks like a builder problem - it should not build 
org.eclipse.ui because it is binary (has no source in it).

Moving to JDT for comments.
