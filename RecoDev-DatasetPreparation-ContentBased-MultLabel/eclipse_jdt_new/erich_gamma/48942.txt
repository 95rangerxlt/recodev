1. Fresh workspace.
2. Open the PDE perspective.
2. In the filters of the Package explorer view, show ".*" files.
3. Create a Hello world plugin.
4. Expand the project.  You will see the libray classpath entries.
5. Right-click on plugin.xml.  Select PDE Tools -> Update Classpath...
6. In the wizard, select the 'Use dynamic classpaths' checkbox and press 
finish.
7. You will see that the package explorer does not refresh, i.e. it is still 
showing the library classpath entries.  yet, when you open the .classpath 
file, it correctly shows the dynamic classpath entry.

Closing and reopening the project renders the projetc tree correctly. So the 
Java model seems to be OK. The bug might be related to bug 46428 (Delta is 
missing class path change).



Erich, please investigate
class path update issue - fixed by leveraging the new Java delta flag: 
F_CLASSPATH_CHANGED
