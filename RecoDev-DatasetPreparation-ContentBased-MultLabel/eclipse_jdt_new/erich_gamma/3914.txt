If the text search dialog is opened while nothing
	is selected, all registered extensions are added
	to the extension list. If the dialog is opened with
	a selection (e.g. Java cu) then the proposed extension
	is java.

	Reason: editor mappings now allow mappings from a file to an editor
	and therefore it can happen that an extension appears more than once.

	Possible fixes:
	1) Only allow/show extensions
	2) Use the editor mapping as is i.e. also allow file names


NOTES:
DM (8/3/01 5:44:19 PM)
	Showing the extensions makes more sence.

DM (8/6/01 11:46:03 AM)
	Code which references extensions is now using sets.
	Fixed in 2.0 stream
