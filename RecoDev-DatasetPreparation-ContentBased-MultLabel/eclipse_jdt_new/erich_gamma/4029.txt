	there are two fixes. 
	1) 	JDT fixes the context so that subtopics are inlined in the

	2)		DOC adds descriptive text to the parent topics so that it makes
			sense to show the subtopics as links inside the page.

	Fix by doing #1

EG (25.07.2001 17:05:52)
	new proposal. remove subtopic links that point to empty pages.

EG (25.07.2001 18:46:31)
