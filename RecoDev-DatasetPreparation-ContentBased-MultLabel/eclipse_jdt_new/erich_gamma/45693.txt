When running tests where an assertEquals(String, String) (or
assertEquals(String, String, String) fails, the JUnit plugin tries to be helpful
by giving some context data to show what the failure is... for example,
assertEquals("/123/", "/0123/");
fails, and the JUnit view displays something like:
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected <......> but was: <...0...>
Now, the intent is *awesome*, but, unfortunately, the fact that only 1 character
is being displayed kinda defeats the purpose.  Could this be increased to
something like 10 characters on each side?  (Or better yet, could a preference
be added... show entire string, or show x context characters...)

The is a general JUnit bug and has nothing to do with the JUnit-Eclipse 
integration. I move the bug to Erich, but it might be better reported at 
junit.org.
while Dirk is correct - we can improve this is in the JUnit test runner. We 
are already using a custom test runner. 

Erich, would you like me to report this on junit.org?  Or is it considered a
"known issue"? :-)

It is a known issue of JUnit (the JUnit framework shouldn't be helpful here 
and leave this up to the test runners),

we should improve the custom test runner to show you the result in a 
comparision viewer. 

the comparision dialog is available since M7 - closing
