Show in packages view (in the outliner) does not work if you have "zoomed" in on some project/package that 
is not the parent of the class you have selected.  This is frustrating since most of the time I get to a class
via "Open Type" and the packages view is in whatever state I left it when I was last navigating.  Show in packages
view should expand/zoom out in the packages view as necessary to accomplish the task the user asked (i.e., 
they want to see the selected class in the packages view)

NOTES:
EG (5/31/2001 10:56:39 PM)
	two options:
	1) only show the types that are currently visible. 
	2) go up in the frame list until the element is found
	
	The navigator does 1) this doesn't address the frustration above
	2) is would decrease the frustration but means the frame list can change under program control

	Time permitting

This is an UI issue because nothing happens (no beep, no dialog) except
flickering in the Packages view

What about simple fix: show the full Packages view and select the element. The
user can then use the Back button to go to the previous view.

Note: Same problem if working set or filter is applied


*** Bug 3704 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
My previous note: "Same problem if working set or filter is applied"
is not correct because a filter is something else and the user can not simply
reapply the filter (because he might not know which filter has been removed).
There is a separate exsiting BR for this:

Go to type confusing if binary is selected and libraries are
http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3805


we now warn the user when the element could not be found because it is filtered 
away.
