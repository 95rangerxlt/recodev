"Organize imports" proposes to import classes named like variables. This is very
annoying, because short variables names like "i" are also often classnames
produced by obfuscators (such classes can for example be found in
"sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto").

I am also seeing this bug in 20020125.

Here is a test case.

public class Test {
	void test() {
		try {
			new Object();
		} catch (RuntimeException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}		
	}
}

After the organize import you will get:

import sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.e;

public class Test {
	void test() {
		try {
			new Object();
		} catch (RuntimeException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}		
	}
}
Organize import implementation belongs to JDT/UI and is being questionned.
fixed in 20020430


Organize imports tries to resolve local variables as Classes
