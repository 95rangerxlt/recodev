In the Package Explorer, the Link to Editor icon should be set as the action's 
hover image, not its regular image.  JFace will then create the greyed regular 
image.  

Also, the tooltip should be "Link With Editor", not "Link to Editor".

Compare with the Navigator.

I've asked Linda for an improved icon.  See bug 32199.

adjusted tooltips.
waiting for the new artwork (currently the enabled, disabled,hover are all set 
to the same image).
Until you get the new artwork, if you set -just- the hover image, you will get 
the right effect.

I believe you <g> but the code is already prepared for the new artwork (we have 
a helper method that sets all the images) and it would have to be tweaked 
twice, changing milestone to RC2.
no action for 2.1
Erich, it seems like we should switch to using "Link with Editor" rather 
than "Link With Editor".  Do you agree?

yes - it should be book title capitalization
I have fixed up the Navigator to use "Link with Editor" (bug 35221).
