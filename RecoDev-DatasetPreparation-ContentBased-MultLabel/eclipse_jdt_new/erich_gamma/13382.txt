I really enjoy using the java browsing perspective but I'm really messed up
everytime I want to perform a CVS operation on a class file. I known that some
objects in the java views are not IResources or map to the same one, but
couldn't JDT simply adapt to the container IResource? I would love to be able to
select a class in the outline or class view and perform a team operation, or
even see if they have outgoing changes.

Without this I have to switch perspectives or expand the packages

The plan is to return the compilation unit resource for top-level types.
The problem is that we can end up with duplicate contributions.
Compare/replace with local history is an example. It is available on both 
ITypes and on IFile. We are working on this but have another bug on this topic.
