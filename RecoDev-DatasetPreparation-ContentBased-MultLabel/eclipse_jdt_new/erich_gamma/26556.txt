PDE Junit (pde.junit 2.1.0 and 2.0.0) does not read plugin info from the 
plugins directory, but only from the workspace directory. This requires to 
bring many of the 585 plugins in the plugins dir (on our WSAD), into workspace.
It takes lot's of time and makes test process cumbersome.
I'm sure that solving this bug will make love easier for many PDE developers.

 Thank you in advance,
   Boris.

PDE Junit launching is now consistent with PDE workspace launching
