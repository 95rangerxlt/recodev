Steps to reproduce:
- Add a project from a repository (a test project, so you can release something)
- Turn on "Show Version Info" in the Packages view
- Make a change to a compilation unit, and save
- Notice that there is a '>' in front of the CU name to indicate that it 
is 'dirty'
- Expand the CU's tree in the packages view so that you can see the class and 
its methods
- Notice that the '>' shows on the class (this is good)... but it also shows 
for all methods (this is a feature request - it should be filtered to include 
only the changed methods... continue the steps to see the bug)
- Now synchronize, and release the change you just made
- Note that the '>' is gone from the CU (this is correct) but it still remains 
on the class and methods (this is the bug)

Either we need to be consistent with the '>' on sub-items of a CU, or we need 
to only show the '>' on the CU itself, and not bother trying to be fancy and 
show on all sub-items.

Opt to remove the version decorator for sub elements of a compilation unit
version indicators on CU subelements are no longer shown 


Version info "dirty" indicator is not propagated to classes/methods after synchronize
