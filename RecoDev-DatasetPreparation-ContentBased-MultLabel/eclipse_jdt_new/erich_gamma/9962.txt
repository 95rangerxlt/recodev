I have a JavaDoc template for <code>null</code>. This worked fine in 20020125, 
but in 20020214 I get:

< code > null < / code >

which is rather less helpful.

As I'm currently going through all the Ant classes improving documentation, 
this is a pain in the neck :(

Just found the turning the code formatter off fixes this behaviour, so possibly 
the code formatter itself is at fault...

seems to be fixed in 20020328


Templates in JavaDoc in 20020214 insert inappropriate spaces
