I am testing pde.junit 2.1. The test workspace is always created in temp space. 
I would like the ability to pre-initialize a workspace and then point junit at 
it. When I try to run with -data <path> the argument seems to get ignored. 
Setting the working location does not seem to have any impact on the choice of 
workspace either.

In fact this is turning out to be a real pain for us, because the workspace on 
my machine goes to c:\Documents and Settings\administrator\Local 
Settings\temp\org.eclipse.pde.junit.workspace\. We are generating fairly long 
path names for EJB code gen, and adding the extra 80 (or so) characters to the 
prefix is blowing the win path length limit for most of the code we are 
generating as part of the test case.

If there is a way to tackle this it would help us. In the meantime I'll look at 
hacking the launcher.
This should be also a feature of the Eclipse launcher
added support to define the workspace location in the pde JUnit launch config.
A new versin of the plugin is available from the JDT UI project page:

JUNIT: would like the ability to specify test workspace location
