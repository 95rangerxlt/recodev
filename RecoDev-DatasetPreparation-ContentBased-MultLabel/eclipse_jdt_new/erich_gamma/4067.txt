Two (very related) problems follow:

1. Go to Window->Preferences->Java->Installed JRE's
2. Click Add
3. Let the JRE type as "Standard VM" but enter a JRE name ("J9") and set the JRE home directory to
	the location of a J9 install.
4. The window properly displays "Not a JDK Root; Java executable was not found"
5. Set the JRE type to "J9 VM"
6. The dialog continues to display the error message, but the setup is now correct.
	The false error message will only go away if you delete the JRE home directory and reenter it or 
	close and reopen the dialog
7. Once the false error message is gone, set the JRE type to "Standard VM"
8. The dialog does not display the error message, but the setup is now wrong.
