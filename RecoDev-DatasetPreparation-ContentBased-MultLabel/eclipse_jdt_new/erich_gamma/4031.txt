	Fixed, details:

	Bonjour Erich,
	I finaly had the chance to browse through Eclipse 0.9, and I noticed a few
	images in org.eclipse.jdt.ui were older version of icons I sent you
	Find attached all the icons that should have been included in eclipse 0.9.

	cview, eview:
	- class_hi.gif
	This would slighty invalidate the doc and 
==> Changed the icon.
- jperspective.gif
==> Minimal change
==> Changed the icon.

	wizban:
	- All images are either old or in low color. Not sure how low color graphic
	have found their way in a full color folder. My apologies if this was a
	mistake from this side of the atlantic.
==> Using these icons.

	Also, I do not know how important it is, but I noticed that jdt, search and
	debugger do not have the 'icons/basic/*'  folders implemented.
==> This would require code changes since we directly access the full folder most of the time.
==> No action.
