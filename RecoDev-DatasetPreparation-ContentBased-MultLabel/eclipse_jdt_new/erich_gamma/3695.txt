	CodeFormatterPreferencePage should not hold on to the propertyStore it gets in the initDefaults method
	(or cut the link somewhere)
	a lot of memory cannot be freed because of this

NOTES:
EG (5/28/01 4:59:36 PM)
	The CodeFormatterPreferencePage has life cycle is the same as the workbench. 
	It should be an instance variable not a static variable.

	this does make a differnce - the class keeps links to things it should not.
	the link is static so it is _never_  released. all the stuff that can be reached from that point will consequently be _never_ freed
	and that's a lot of memory as i saw.

EG (18.07.2001 15:34:24)
	review the code for potential memory leaks and misuse of static instead of instance variables.
