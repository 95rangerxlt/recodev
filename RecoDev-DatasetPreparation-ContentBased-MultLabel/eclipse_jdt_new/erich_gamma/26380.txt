Steps:

1)In JUnit select source file: junit.samples.money.MoneyBag
2)goto Navigate>Go To>Referring Tests

A selection box appears with a list of projects containing 
junit.framework.Test. 
   -The message at the top contains bad english...
   -The dialog shows a list of Interfaces all with the name Test. Is it 
looking for classes other than junit.framework.Test? If not this renders the 
search text field on the top useless. Prehapes the various 
junit.framework.Tests in the workspace whould be listed by package name (not 
class name) to make the search text field usable.

bad English indeed and the list should rather show the project containing the 
tests rather than the test interface itself.
