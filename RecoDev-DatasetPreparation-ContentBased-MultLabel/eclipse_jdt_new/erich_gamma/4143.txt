Core Refactoring (refactoring.properties) reports unused keys becaus they
	are computed in computeErrorMessage.

	This is error prone: one of those keys was wrong (mode instead of model).

	Verifying NLS correctness is harder if it is done by another person because they
	have to follow the method calls.

	Sugggest to fix in 2.0 stream


NOTES:
EG (24.08.2001 12:19:10)
	agreed, should be fixed in 2.0

AK (9/19/2001 1:08:12 PM)
	fixed for 201
