Tried to do minimal changes to the above method to fix 1GF5S2N: ITPJUI:ALL - Can't add an internal JAR to the buildpath in simple project layout.
	But now the implementation is suboptimal in readability and performance.

	Should be reviewed and recoded after June.

NOTES:
EG (7/11/2001 12:41:26 PM)
	Also JCORE has added a class path validation API that we should use for checking.

MA (31.07.2001 11:35:10)
	Core API not yet released. 

MA (17.09.2001 18:31:39)
	added in 200
