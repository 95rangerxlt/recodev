Otherwise an error is reported in the launch config dialog.

It is however still possible to launch a test suite by opening it in the editor
and choosing Run->Run As->New JUnit Plug-in Test

To reproduce, try to run (and configure) the JDT UI AllAllTests testsuite.

Workaround is to use the launch short cuts

My bad.  I meant to check with Erich if the validation check for the test 
class is too strict, but I forgot.
