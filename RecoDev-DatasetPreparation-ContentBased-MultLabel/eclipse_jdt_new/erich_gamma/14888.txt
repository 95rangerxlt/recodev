On build M5, said feature does not recognize boolean property as special(as 
stated in Java in a Nutshell, Chapter 10 Java Beans, Naming Patterns and 
Conventions)

private boolean applicableToAdult = true;
produces 
public boolean getApplicableToAdult() { ... }
instead of
public boolean isApplicableToAdult() { ... }

The "get" version may be acceptable ... but it sure looks weird to use:
if (getApplicableToAdult()) { ... }
