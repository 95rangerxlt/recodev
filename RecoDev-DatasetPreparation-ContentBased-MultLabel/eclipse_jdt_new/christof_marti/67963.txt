- toggle comment StyledText
- press enter to add a new line
-> takes too long

The JavaIndenter uses the JavaHeuristicScanner which calls in its
isDefaultPartition(..) TextUtilities.getPartition(..) which leads in
DefaultPartitioner.getPartition(..) to a call to
AbstractDocument.getPositions(..). getPositions(..) becomes expensive with many
partitions (that is, typed positions).

Adding a new line at the end of the commented StyledText just took ~1 min. on my
machine.

Fixed twofold:
- added FastPartitioner (replacement for DefaultPartitioner, caches the list of
Positions instead of getting a new one upon every query. Saves an array creation
for every query)

- JavaHeuristicScanner now uses the partitioning information to skip non-default
partitions alltogether instead of querying the partition type for every character.

Here are the numbers, nothing to add...
