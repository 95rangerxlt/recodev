When reverting a compilation unit, the final selection is usually not the
previously selected element, even when it is still in the text.

We already have hooks to remember the semantic selection, but still fail quite
often.

- the selection offset within the element is restored - which is no longer valid
if the reverted changes are between the element offset and the selection offset
- only the selection start offset is re-/stored - the selection end offset is
not re-/stored

Here's a test case:
1. from JUnit open TestCase.getName()
2. in that method start changing fName
3. revert
==> the caret is after the method and getName() is no longer selected in the
outline.

Works more reliable now.
I released the patch.
Available in builds > 20040130

Besides the minor changes we discussed there's also the following scenario which
would be nice if it worked:

Test Case 1:
1) open TestCase.getName() in segmented mode
2) place caret before last }
3) enter space
4) revert

Test Case 2 (harder to fix):
1) open TestCase.getName() in segmented mode
2) place caret after last }
3) enter space
4) revert

This was not true since we held off releasing to HEAD. Released now.

Moving to 3.0 M8 for solving the described test cases described in comment 3.
Patch is ready - will review & release directly after 3.0 M8
Released Christof's patch for above test cases but found another one:

Same method as above. Add space before comment (at text widget position 0)
Revert
==> switches to full mode
Fixed (without all corner cases).
