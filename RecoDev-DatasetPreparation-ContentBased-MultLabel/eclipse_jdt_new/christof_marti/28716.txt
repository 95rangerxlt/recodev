When the 'Show Source of Selected Element Only' button is pressed and the 
editor is narrowed down to the selected method the Goto Matching Bracket action 
fails. It reports 'No Matching Bracket' found in the status bar. Invoking the 
same action on the same bracket when the editor shows the whole of the source 
file works as expected.
