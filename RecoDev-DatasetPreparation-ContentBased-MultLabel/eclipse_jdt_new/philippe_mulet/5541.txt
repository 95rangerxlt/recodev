Build 207 + latest JDTCORE

When adding a file X.java inside a project with source folder named 'a.b',
the package view does not refresh properly (no child is displayed under 
source folder).
The code for creating a Java element (JavaCore.create) did prevent this scenario 
to occur, but it should have allowed it to map to a package fragment root.

Fixed

Fixed Bug 415541 - [1.8][compiler] Type annotations in the body of static initializer get dropped. 

Bug 55419 - Generalize compilation error detection for other launchers
