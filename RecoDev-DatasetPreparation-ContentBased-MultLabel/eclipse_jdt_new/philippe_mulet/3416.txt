14/tests/lang/BINC/binc058/binc05801/binc05801.html - POSITIVE TEST
	This is a binary compatibility test. You need to compile the test cases 
in the same order I put them below one by one. And then execute it. The problem 
with the Eclipse
	compiler occurs only at runtime.

Test cases:

	javac 1.4:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: passed with java.lang.IllegalAccessError: try to 
access method javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc058.binc05801.binc05801s.m()I from 
class javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc058.binc05801.binc05801c 

	javac 1.3:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

	Eclipse compiler:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

NOTES:

	I run the JCK test alone using javac to find out what was the result 
using javac. It worked. We don't run properly because the declaring class we 
used in the getfield bytecode
	is javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc058.binc05801.Super and not 
javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc058.binc05801.binc05801c.

Adapted to this change for 1.4 mode only.
Fixed


JCK 1.4 - BINC - the new method is less accessible than the old one (1GK7VXD)
