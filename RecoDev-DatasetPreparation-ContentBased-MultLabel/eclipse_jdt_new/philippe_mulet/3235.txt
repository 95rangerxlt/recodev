The implementation of PackageFragmentRoot.exists() is checking whether the root is present on the classpath of the owner or in its output location.
This garanties proper working for SourceModel roots and Builder roots.

We probably want to revisit this so as to add new PackageFragmentRoots for denoting BuilderRoot with the output location check in them.
Question: should those roots be created relatively to the owner of the output location (as currently) or relatively to the client of the output 
location (referring project). The latter would look better.

Fixed to solve bug 6865.

Pkg root existency check resumed to a simple opening check, and the opening 
code is testing for presence on the classpath.


PackageFragmentRoot existency check need to be revisited (1GCUNO7)
