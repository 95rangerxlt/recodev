If you create an interface and then try to use the content-assist feature to
reference the same interface within the file (say through a factory method) the
assist-list displays the interface with a class icon, not the interface icon.

Reproduced on Windows XP, NT and 2000 on various hardware.  Also reproduced in
WSWB 1.0 and eclipse 0.9 (on same platforms).
