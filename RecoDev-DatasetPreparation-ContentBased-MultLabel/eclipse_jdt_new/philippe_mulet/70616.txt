When compiling the following source:
public class X {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Enum<X> ex = null;
		String s = ex.name();
	}
}

an error is reported against Enum classfile, claiming it is inconsistent.
It should bind variables properly, and only report a bound mismatch in the end.

Added regression test: GenericTypeTest#test256.
Problem is that variable creation was not allowing proper visibility of the 
one being defined.

Fixed
