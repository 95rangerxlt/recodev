Build 20020124

The following 2 code sample will lead to verification error when run.


public class X {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    try {
      assert false : 0L; 
    } catch(AssertionError e){
    }
    try {
      assert false : new X();
    } catch(AssertionError e){
    }
  }
}

The following 2 code sample will lead to verification error when run.


public class X {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    try {
      assert false : 0L; 
    } catch(AssertionError e){
    }
    try {
      assert false : new X();
    } catch(AssertionError e){
    }
  }
}
First issue is due to the fact the literal 0L constant value is incorrectly Int
(0) and not Long(0), this is fooling the choice of the proper assertion error 
constructor signature.

The second is due to the fact no signature is found for an object type when its 
type isn't exactly Object, String or null.

Both are now fixed
