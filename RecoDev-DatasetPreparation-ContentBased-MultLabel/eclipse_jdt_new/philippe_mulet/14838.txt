Open a Scrapbook page.  Write any valid statement, add a // comment at the end 
of the line.  Example:
  System.out.println("example\n");  // this is a comment
Select the line from "System" to "comment", right click and Run.  You get a 
compile error saying 'Syntax error on token ";", "Unexpected End Of File" 
expected'.
If you replace the // comment by a /* */ comment, it compiles correctly.
If you include the newline at the end of the selected text (put the cursor to 
the left of "System", press Shift+End, press Shift+RightArrow), it also 
compiles correctly.  All the same, it is weird that including a comment in the 
selection causes a compilation error.

Re-opened (thanks bugzilla, not a dup)
This appears to be a problem in the JDT Core. We're passing the snippet in and
getting a call back to the acceptProblem() method.

I have a theory about what's happening here, but I don't know the JDT Core code
well enough to verify it. Could it be that we're generating source which looks
like this?
public void run() { <insert snippet> }

If so, the above test case would result in the following erroneous source:
public void run() { System.out.println("Foo"); //}
You suspected well. Fixed and released in HEAD.
I tried to verify the fix on build 20020502 under Win2k.  It is NOT working 
correctly.  Which build will get the fix incorporated?
It is only going to be released into the next tuesday's integration build.
