1) create the following class
public class X {
   void foo(){
      this.<cursor>0
   }
}
2) do ctrl+space
Nothing happen, just bing.

CompletionScanner identify '.0' as a number and throw an InvalidCursorLocation 
exception.

Fixed, bug was in completion scanner which didn't handle dot prefixed number
