The built in Java compiler generates a error message of the form "Exception 
xxxx thrown within an initializer must be handled locally" when the initializer 
of an anonymous class can throw an uncaught checked exception. This is contrary 
to section 8.6 of the JLS version 2 (top of page 189) "An instance initializer 
in an anonymous class ca throw any exception".

Changed exception analysis to allow this scenario (for anonymous constructors, 
the list can be augmented by uncaught checked exceptions).
Fixed.
