Build 20020122

If you open a hierarchy on a type, and one of the super types has never been 
opened before, then a HierarchyType is used to compute it. However the 
hierarchy resolver doesn't handle HierarchyTypes when it tries to find the 
corresponding handle. As a result, the hierarchy is missing some super types.

If you open a hierarchy on a type, and one of the super types has never been 
opened before, then a HierarchyType is used to compute it. However the 
hierarchy resolver doesn't handle HierarchyTypes when it tries to find the 
corresponding handle. As a result, the hierarchy is missing some super types.
Fixed by handling HierarchyTypes in HierarchyResolver.findSuperClass(...) and 
findSuperInterfaces(...), and by adding the super type name and super interface 
names to the HierarchyType.


No hierarchy when using HierachyType
