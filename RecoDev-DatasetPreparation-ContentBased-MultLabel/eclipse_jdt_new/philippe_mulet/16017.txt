Build 20020514

When constructing a self-hosted workspace, the Java builder will report build 
failures when attempting to build a project which depends onto an internal 
library from a binary project.

This is a consequence of a recent change intended to reduce the error count 
when building large inconsistent workspaces. But the new behavior is too harsh 
and prevent normal usage of internal JARs.

A workaround is to rather use external JARs as opposed to internal ones...

Fixed by only examining true project dependencies for this concern.
