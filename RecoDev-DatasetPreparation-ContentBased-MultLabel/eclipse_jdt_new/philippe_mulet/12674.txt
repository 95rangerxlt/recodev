Build 20020402

When reconciling, some problems may surface which were detected inside a 
different unit, e.g.

Project1
 +- X.java
Project2 (prereqs Project1)
 +- Y.java extends P1/X.java
Project3 (prereqs Project2)
 +- Z.java extends P2/Y.java 

When reconciling Project3/Z.java, an error should be detected since its 
hierarchy needs X.java which isn't visible on Project3's classpath, but this 
error is only reported against Y.java (directly), and should not be surfaced 
when reconciling Z.java.
