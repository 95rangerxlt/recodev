Fixed by disabling the introduced #setFocusType. Still need to investigate why 
it is causing such trouble (debugging showed that it 2 instances of the working 
copy are available, the working copy one not being the one cached inside the 
LookupEnvironment).


SetFocusType did introduce the handle to the original compilation unit (as 
opposed to the working copy) in the handle cache since it did a request of the 
focus type to the searchable environment.

From there on, the working copy handle is thought to be outside the computed 
hierarchy, and thus the hierarchy is empty.


No typehierarchy in working copy
