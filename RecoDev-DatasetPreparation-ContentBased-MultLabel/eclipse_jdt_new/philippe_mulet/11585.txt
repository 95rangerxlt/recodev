With a large number (150-200) of projects in the workspace, some essential 
operations ("Open type to hierarchy", "debug step", "switch perspective", etc.) 
slow down to 5-10 minutes for a single operation to complete. At this point the 
state of the workbench is not useable and it is not always possible to predict 
which operation will cause the wb to lock-up.

This is reproducible on all recent "stable" levels of Eclipse 2.

Large # of projects lock essential operations in the Workspace
