Build 206 - 20011025

1. Add the following packages and compilation unit:
    x
      A.java
    x.y
      B.java
2. You get a JavaElementDelta with the following structure
    x (ADDED)
      A.java (ADDED)
    x.y (ADDED)
      B.java (ADDED)

JavaElementDeltas on A.java and B.java are unnecessary.

JavaElementDeltas on A.java and B.java are unnecessary.
Need to investigate.

1. Did we spec these deltas to contain leaf added elements ?

2. Would we break current clients ?
The UI would not be affected.
However, the delta semantics of Resource and Java deltas should be the same.
Fixed by processing children only if delta is changed.
Package fragments are processed separately as subpackages addition/deletion 
must also be reported.


Deeper than necessary JavaElementDelta when package added
