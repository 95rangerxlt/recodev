I believe the cause is as follows:

 You are building apt.jar and aptext.jar.   apt.jar depends on aptext.jar
You're build.properties file does not say anything about compile order for these two jars.  Therefore, the actual order they are built in is vm dependent (depends on order of keys coming out of Properties & HashMap objects)

I suspect you have simply been lucky in the past and aptext.jar has always come first.  However, the build was updated to use a 1.6 vm instead of the 1.4 vm used previously.  This change likely results in the apt.jar coming first.

The fix would be to add the following to your build.properties:
jars.compile.order = aptext.jar,apt.jar

Released fix in HEAD.
Walter, should I also tag the project ?
Thanks for putting in the fix, Olivier, and thanks for finding it, Andrew.  I wonder how I could have found out about that build property?

I'll tag later today - I need to make sure our manifest versions are correctly updated.
Walter, I was not sure if you would be online today. I updated the map file by changing only the test project entry. I checked and the only change is this change to the build.property file.
Closing as FIXED.
The only docs regarding this particular property is in the help under the Plug-in Development Environment Guide/Reference/Feature and Plug-in Build configuration.
