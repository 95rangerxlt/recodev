Build 20020514 + latest core

In the following example the range for the if statement should be [125|33] but 
it is [125|33]

package locals_in;

public class A_test521 {
	public volatile boolean flag;
	
	public void foo() {
		int i= 5;
		/*]*/if (flag)
			i= 10;/*[*/
		i--;
	}
}

Dirk, typo i think - 'should be' and 'is' are the same
I will try to fix it for today's build if I can.

Fixed. I forgot to remove part of the hack I was using to set the proper positions in the 
ASTConverter. All regression tests are green. It should be included in today's build.
