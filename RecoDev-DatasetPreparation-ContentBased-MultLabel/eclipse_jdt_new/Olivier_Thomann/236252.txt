The batch compiler's help version is "0.872, 3.4.0 release candidate-4". We should change it to "0.872, 3.4.0" so that we don't make users think they're not using the latest.

The JDT/Core build notes should also be updated the same way.

Olivier, please make the change once 3.4RC4 is declared.
I think we should change it to:
0.873, 3.4.0

since changing this will force a retagging of the whole project with version v_873.

Correct. Sorry for the confusion.

Doing bug cleanup. Is this still a candidate for 3.4?

McQ, note it has you flagged for PMC approval with four +1 code checks.
Yes, this is definitely a candidate for 3.4. We don't want to show a release candidate version for the 3.4.0 batch compiler version.
I am waiting for PMC approval to release.
Let's fix it.


Released for 3.4.


Batch compiler's help should not have 'release candidate-4' in the version name
