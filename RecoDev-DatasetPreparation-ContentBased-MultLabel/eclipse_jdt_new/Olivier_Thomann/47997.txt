This applies to the new code formatter preference page in I20031203. It seems 
to me that the only way to disable empty lines after the opening brace of 
classes is to disable _all_ empty lines within classes. This is especially 
ugly when wrapping before opening braces. Looking at the following example, 
I'd like to get rid of the marked empty lines. I propose an extra option for 
this.

public class Example
{
                        <--- THIS LINE
    public static class Pair
    {
                        <--- AND THIS ONE
        public String first;

        public String second;
    };

    private LinkedList fList;

my formatting settings
*** Bug 48010 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Moving to core, this is a formatter issue. 

Olivier, can you comment?
just to bring in my suggestion from Bug 48010. The options that state "blank 
line before method/variable declaration" should possibly be changed to "blank 
line between method/variable declaration" because the option "blank lines 
before a declaration of some kind" takes care of the number of spaces at the 
top of the class.
I will investigate how to do this without adding too many options.
So basically I should change existing settings to be called "between" instead 
of "before" for the field, member and methods.
In this case, I should add a new option to insert blank lines at the beginning 
of the type body.
Could this solve your problem?
+1 I would agree with comment 6.. although I suspect there may not be a need 
for the new option as I would imagine everyone would set the number of blank 
lines at the beginning of the type body to 0. I may be wrong!
I prefer to keep some flexibility. In this case, the default value would be 0 
and it could be changed if necessary.
I am investigating.
Silvio, I let you know what the new option name will be.
I am not sure the renaming is necessary. We can keep existing name and simply
add a new option to insert blank lines before the first body declarations. The
reason why I don't like too much the renaming in "between" is that it implies
that new lines are inserted only between body declarations of the same type
(between fields means that a new line is inserted only between two fields).
Any comment?
I am working on adding the new option, but I need some feedback to know the way
I should change the existing options.
you can keep the names the same but somehow make it clear that the new option 
will override any other whitespace at the top of a type + of course make sure 
that the option does override it!
or you can rename the other options to 
"blank line before method/variable declaration except if declared at top of a 
type"
I think this is a little bit too long.
Silvio, let me know the way you want to rename options or leave them as is.
On my side, I will add the new option and send you a patch to update the UI.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Silvio, please add the corresponding option in the UI.
Ok, so I guess, I am somewhat late now :-) But if read you correctly, there is 
now a setting which gives me this layout:

public class Example
{
    public static class Pair
    {
        public String first;

        public String second;
    };

    private LinkedList fList;

...

If this is the case, I am happy. :-)
