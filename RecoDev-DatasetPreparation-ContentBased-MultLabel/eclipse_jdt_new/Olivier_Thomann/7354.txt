The batch compiler creates the directories structure corresponding to the 
package structure even if there is no output directory specified with the -d 
option.
In this case javac generates all the .class files in the user.dir directory 
without any subdirectories corresponding to the package names.
The batch compiler should be compatible with this mode. To get the old behavior, 
simply specify '-d .'. This will generate all the .class files with the 
corresponding directory structure inside the user.dir directory.

The corresponding changes are released in HEAD. Need to run all the compiler 
tests.
Fixed in HEAD.
