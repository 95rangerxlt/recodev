What is the bug exactly?
For the simple name, 'Inner' looks ok for me.
What do you expect? 
sorry, stupid me - to hectic a day i guess
the description should be:

ArrayType (Inner[], length 7)

has subnode:
SimpleType(Inner, length 7) <<BUG!

which has subnode
SimpleName(Inner, length 7) <<BUG!

it should be clear now
So you expect to get:
ArrayType (Inner[], length 7)

has subnode:
SimpleType(Inner, length 5)

which has subnode
SimpleName(Inner, length 5)

Am I right?


exactly
Fixed and released in HEAD. Regression tests added.


ast: incorrect length of SimpleName (subsubnode of ArrayType)
