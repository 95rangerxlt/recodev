The code formatter does not respect the "maximum line length" property when 
the indentation is set to tabulation.

To reproduce:

1. Go in "Workbench" / "Preferences" / "Java" / "Code formatter".
In the "Line splitting" item, set the "Maximum line length" property to 80.
In the "Style" item, check the "Indentation is represented by a tab" property 
and set the "Number of space representing a tab" property to 4.

2. Create a class with the following method:

public void mth1(String s1, String s2, String s3, String s4) throws Exception {
}

3. Right click on the editor and choose "Format".

4. The produced code pass thought of the vertical line delimitating the 
maximum line length.

5. Raison (I guess): the tabulation is interpreted as one character instead of 
4 (as we defined it on the first point).

Best regards,

I found the bug. A fix will be released after the today's build. Now even if the source code goes 
beyond the vertical line, it has the right size. The font used to display the keyword is in bold and 
this shifts the result to the right. So the line looks like it goes beyond the vertical line even if 
the number of characters is lower than the maximum number of characters for a single line.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Fixed.
