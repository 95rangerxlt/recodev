Olivier - Can you please do the necessary so that the batch compiler 
understands -deprecation ?

You might also want to check the compiler exiting the IDE in case of problem 
(we want to *not* perform a System.exit(...) when running through the Ant task 
I think). Please double check with Platform/Ant.
Fixed and released in HEAD. -deprecation is now equivalent to -warn:deprecation.
If -nowarn or -
warn:none is specified after this option, it invalidates it.

I have found the problem on the pde.code side which led to a system.exit. The option -noExit was 
specified at the end. Then when an unknown option is used in the command line, the batch compiler 
did a system.exit. Putting this option (-noExit) as the first option doesn't crash the IDE 
anymore. You get an error message in the ant console instead. We need to provide a complete javac 
ant task based on our batch compiler to completely fix this problem. Hopefully the fix in pde.core 
will be released soon.
