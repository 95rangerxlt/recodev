The method javadoc has been changed between 1.6 and 1.7 to no longer return null for type parameter.
See http://download.java.net/jdk7/docs/api/javax/lang/model/element/Element.html#getEnclosingElement()

vs:

http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/lang/model/element/Element.html#getEnclosingElement()

Checking with javac 1.6, it looks like the System compiler never returned null. So we should also fix our implementation to make sure we match the new documentation.
I don't think we should fix it according to the target source version of the annotation processor. We should simply return the getGenericElement() value in this case.

Proposed fix + regression test

Walter, I would take care of releasing this.
Are you ok with that change ?

Same patch with updated copyrights.

Proposed fix + regression test

Improved regression test to check that the getEnclosingElement() is equals to the getGenericElement() for type parameter instead of just checking it is not null.
Sounds like a typical case of Sun changing the spec to match their implementation, rather than changing the implementation to match the spec.

I checked the Sun bug database but I don't see any commentary on this.  I think it is okay to change the behavior for 3.7 given that javac 1.6 works this way.
Released for 3.7M7.
