N20081126-2000.

Fixed. Any hidden WorkingSet will now appear in the PE once assigned.
Patch works but has two trivial issues:
- don't use Javadoc inside methods and don't add @since tags for local variables
  ==> use an end of line comment
- only compute 'activeWorkingSets' if 'checkForYetHiddenWorkingSet' is 'true'

Created attachment 121754
Made the required changes.
Sorry Raksha, I missed another issue: please always declare variables in the most inner scope possible. In this case, 'checkForYetHiddenWorkingSet' is only used inside "if (isValidWorkingSet..." and hence should not be visible outside that scope.

Fixed.
Mmh, I now finally had my coffee and found some more issues with the patch (sorry):
- wording in comments: if it returns (or gets) an array then don't say "set" but
  say what it is i.e. "array"
- 'null' issues:
   - getActiveWorkingSets() returns 'null' but that's not specified in
     the Javadoc. If 'null' is allowed as param or return type then this must be
     specified in the Javadoc
   - Arrays.asList(getActiveWorkingSets()) can cause an NPE

Fixed the NPE.
Patch is good. Thanks Raksha.

Note that we normally don't repeat the 'null' case in the normal Javadoc text (along with the tag is good enough unless it is really important).

Also: use <code>null</code> and not just null so that it is rendered as code.

Fixed in HEAD.
