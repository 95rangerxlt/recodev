I20070601-0010

I had the platform and jdt doc plugins in two different working sets:
  - WS JDT: jdt.doc
  - WS Platform: platform.doc

- selected all doc plug-ins
- Assign Working Sets...
- New..., create WS "Doc" with selection
- uncheck both grey-checked WS (JDT & Platform)
- click link "Package Explorer working sets"
- move WS Doc up or down
- OK
=> WS JDT and WS Platform are grey-checked again
=> Expected: check state should not be changed when working sets are moved around

Not really minor. I run into this every time I create a new working set (when I try to configure the Package Explorer from the dialog).
At least in I20090127-0100, it's even worse:
- Assign Working Sets...
- check or uncheck a working set
- click 'Configure Package Explorer Working Sets'
- click Cancel
=> Working Set Assignments dialog still shows my previous checked state
- click OK
=> working sets are not changed
=> expected: elements should end up in the checked working sets

Fixed. The settings are remembered now between dialogs.
Hi Raksha. I looked at the patch but it does not work: to test follow the steps from comment 2.

Some minor details:
- why is fCheckedWorkingSets public? Fields should almost never be public.
- copyright in WorkingSetConfigurationDialog is not correct
- wrong formatting (missing indent):
			if (addedWorkingSets != null)
			fCheckedWorkingSets.addAll(addedWorkingSets);

Fixed the datastructure and all minor issues.
Raksha, the patch still does not work as it missed to update the data structure when clicking (De-)Select All. After thinking of it again: why do you duplicate the checked state with a separate set. The same information is already available in ConfigureWorkingSetAssignementAction.GrayedCheckedModel.getChecked(). You simply need to use that information and combine it with what you get back from the configure dialog.

- the if-check here is not needed:						
if  (fCheckedWorkingSets.contains(workingSet))
	fCheckedWorkingSets.remove(workingSet);

- WorkingSetConfigurationDialog.getNewlyAddedWorkingSets()
	Use "working set" instead of "Working Set" in the comment

Yep , replaced the newly created set by taking contents from getChecked() and adding newly added ws from WSCD to it.
Patch is good and works. Committed it with two minor improvements:
- Set fCheckedWorkingSets= new HashSet();
  ==> 'f' prefix is only for fields
- addedWorkingSets is not needed: simply pass dialog.getNewlyAddedWorkingSets()

.
