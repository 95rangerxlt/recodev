The Override/Implement Methods refactoring dialog shows all methods with 
package-private access, even if they are in other packages.

Example:

package foo;
public class Foo {
	void method() {}
}

package bar;
public class Bar extends foo.Foo {
	
}

Activating the Override/Implement Methods on Bar shows Foo.method.

Postpone to 3.2
