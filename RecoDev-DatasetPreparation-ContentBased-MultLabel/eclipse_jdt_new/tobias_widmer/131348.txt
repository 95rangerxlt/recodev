I20060307-1315

Start with these two CUs:

public interface I {
}
public class C implements I {
	boolean value;
}

Select the "value" field, and run the "Pull Up" refactoring.  Select "I" as the destination of the refactoring.  No warnings are presented, but of course a non-final field doesn't make sense in an interface.  After the refactoring there is a compile error in "I".  The refactoring shouldn't allow  non-final fields to be pulled up (or at least warn against it).
