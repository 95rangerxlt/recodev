The following refactorings return descriptors with no JavaRefactoringDescriptor.JAR_REFACTORABLE:

- Convert Anonymous
- Extract Constant
- Extract Method
- Inline Constant
- Replace Invocations
- Move Member Type to New File

Adding this flag to their descriptors would allow them to participate in JAR refactoring as well.

Patch to allow refactorings participate in JAR refactoring

Patch is very low risk and a nice polish. Martin, I opt to have this in M6.
Martin, do you approve?
As discusssed, for m6 it would be nice to have it working for inline, so that the deprection quick fix works.

I suggest to release the other later (along woth test cases)
Released fix for InlineConstant
Fixed in HEAD > 20060404
