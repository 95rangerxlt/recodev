Since version 3.1M5, Source>Generate Delegate Methods has a different 
behaviour concerning the boxes that are checked by default.
It now checks *all* methods from the source class. 
The previous behaviour was to check only those methods that had no delegate 
method already.
If I now click OK, all checked methods are created, even those that exist
already.
