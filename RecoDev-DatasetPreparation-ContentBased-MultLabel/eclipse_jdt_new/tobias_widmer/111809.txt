It would be great if Eclipse implemented the Extract Superclass refactoring.  See

http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractSuperclass.html

Both NetBeans and IDEA claim to implement this, but neither allows a common
superclass to be extracted from two similar classes, as the book suggests.  This
is an opportunity for Eclipse to move ahead.

Tobias, 

we already discussed this for 3.1 and we should try to address this for 3.2 (its
on the plan as investigate).
*** Bug 75603 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
New Extract Supertype refactoring implements the refactoring described in http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractSuperclass.html, except for the renaming of members which has to be done first.
