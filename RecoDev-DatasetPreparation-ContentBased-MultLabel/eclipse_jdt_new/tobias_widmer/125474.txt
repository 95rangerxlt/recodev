Findings from the stand-up demo:

a.) Save Script
(we will stick with the term 'Save' for now. Export is a bit different. It would have to go to the export wizard and also would need a 'import')

'Save Script' Dialog.
- Dialog buttons: 'Save' 'Cancel'
- Buttons on the right: 'Select All' 'Deselect All'.
- Label on top of the table:
    'Select the refactorings to save as a new script:'
- Below the table: Text input field with 'Browse..' button for the destination location.
- Maybe: 'Edit' button on the right of the description field to change the   description as it is saved as well

Refacting Properties page:
- No check boxes on tree
- Buttons 'Remove', 'Edit'

I reworked the script UI to reflect the findings from the stand-up meeting.
Create Script is now a dialog page with the suggested layout.
