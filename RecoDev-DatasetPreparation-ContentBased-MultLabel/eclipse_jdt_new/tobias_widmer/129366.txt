There are still a couple more JDT UI wizard images that need replacing:

Refactor > Create Script
Refactor > Apply Script

Other than these two, this problem is fixed :) thanks!
I would prefer if you file new bugs. The two wizards you mention have been added in 3.2. Tobias, did you make an image request for these?
The images have already been delivered and released
