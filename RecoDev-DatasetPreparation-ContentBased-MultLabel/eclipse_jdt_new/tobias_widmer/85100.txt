Build: I-20050209

Open the Class wizard, and make sure the 'Inherited Abstract Methods' is 
checked.

Create a new class that implement 
org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ITableLabelProvider.

The newly created class will have compilation errors as it is missing some 
methods.

It appears as though only the methods declared by ITableLabelProvider were 
generated for the class.

ITableLabelProvider subclasses IBaseLabelProvider.  I would expect that 
methods declared on the latter should also be generated.
