Move Member Type to New File on Inner does not increase visibility of innerField
and innerMethod resulting in compile errors:

package test4;
public class Outer {
	public class Inner {
		private int innerField;
		private void innerMethod() {
		}
	}
	public void outer() {
		Inner inner= new Inner();
		inner.innerField= 0;
		inner.innerMethod();
	}
}
