Not sure if this is CVS or JDT-UI.
It is related to bug 135168, which is fixed.

If I do a synchronize of SWT projects (and if there are quite a few incoming and outgoing changes) and then update, I get empty folders showing up in the sync view. I'll attach a screen snap.

Sync view after update - still has empty folders
Did changing modes make them go away?
Yes. Change to "Workspace" and there are no empty folders.
Change back to "All Models" and there are empty folders again.

"Java Workspace" also has empty folders, but this mode is not useful for me because it doesn't see the swt fragments that are not on the classpath (i.e. the ones that contain DLLs).
Also, after an update, newly-empty folders in the synchronize view need to be pruned.

i.e. if I do a synchronize and there are both incoming and outgoing changes, and then I do an update which causes some folders to become empty because they only contained incoming changes, then I see those empty folders - but they should be removed from the sync view tree.
I will investigate for RC3.

Patch

This patch fixes this specific problem. I give it my approval as the Team component lead if JDT wants to target it fir RC3
Patch looks good to me. It fixes the same problem on IFolders which is already in for IPackageFragments.
Markus, do you approve for 3.2?
Dani, do you approve for 3.2?
+1 for 3.2 RC3.
Approving as well for 3.2 RC3.
Reviewed with Benno

Fixed in HEAD > 20060503
verifying...
Unable to verify as I cannot reproduce the problem in 3.2RC2.

Verified that the code is in, however, and that it makes sense.
Carolyn, can you verify that this is fixed?
