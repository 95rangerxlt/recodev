UndoableOperation2ChangeAdapter does not follow the spec of IUndoableOperation#addContext(IUndoContext context), which makes JDT UI's UndoManagerTests#test9 fail.

The current implementation inserts the specified context in a list, regardless whether the context is already there. This violates the contract of IUndoableOperation#addContext which states that the same context object must not be added twice.
