There's a hidden feature in the type hierarchy, that allows you to select a type
XY and an inherited method, open the context menu and select Source > Override
in 'XY'. This action has not been updated for 5.0 and creates a wrong method
stub when generics are involved, e.g. here:

public class Top<E> {
    public void method(E e) { }
}
class XY<ELEMENT> extends Top<ELEMENT> {
    
}

It creates (wrong formatting, 'E' instead of 'ELEMENT'):
	public void method(E e) {
	        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
	        super.method(e);
	    }

I'd suggest to drop this action, since the Override/Implement Methods... dialog
and content assist do better jobs.

Martin, comments ?
Me and Tobias discussed to remove this feature. Otherwise it would have to be
changed to use the new AST stub utility methods.
Opt to remove it early 3.2 then.
