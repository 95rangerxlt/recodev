I should not be forced to close and reopen the editor when I enalbe comment
formatting (work in progress preference page).
The option to enable/disable comment formatting is now available on the code 
formatter preference page (no reopening of the editor necessary anymore)
Can't close/verify since it is not yet released.

Please add a comment once the feature really is available so that it can be
verified.
