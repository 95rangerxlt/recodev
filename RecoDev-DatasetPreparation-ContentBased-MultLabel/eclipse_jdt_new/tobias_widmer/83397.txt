Hi, 
I used the class wizard to create a new class (HashMapTest) that extends 
HashMap, with "Constructors from superclass" selected.

The wizard created this constructor:
public HashMapTest(Map< ? extends K, ? extends V> arg0)
{
   super(arg0);
}

the compiler gives errors that K and V cannot be resolved into types.

The same occur with methods whether created by the wizard or not.

I am using the 3.1M4 stable build with Sun J2SE 5.0.
Compiler compliance is set to 5.0 default.

Good luck
Roger

Moving to JDT/UI to comment the code generation inside the new class wizard.
Why wilcard are used with type variables?
Tobias,

this goes along the same lines as generating override/implements methods in the
new wizard.

Martin, you and I should dicuss this. Can you please step by.
