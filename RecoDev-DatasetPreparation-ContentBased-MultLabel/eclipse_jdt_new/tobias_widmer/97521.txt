In RC1, given code:

public class A {
	<T> void foo(B<T> b) {
		
	}
}

class B<T> {
	
}

Select "foo", and "move method".  b is offered as a target, but if selected, the
user is told: "This method could not be moved to the specified target, since the
target is a generic entity".  Ideally, the move would be allowed, since the type
parameters on the method and class match.  Failing that, would it be possible to
not offer b in the first place?

Not critical for 3.1. Nice 3.2 candidate.
