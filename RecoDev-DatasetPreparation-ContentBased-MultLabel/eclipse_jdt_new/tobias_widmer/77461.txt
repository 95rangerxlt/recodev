Instead of having the current check box for inlining I would prefer having one
saying "Create delegate in source compilation unit". This makes it more clear
what we are doing.

Instead of having the current check box for inlining I would prefer having one

what we are doing.
When checked we should provide support to deprecated the delegate.
For M3: Changed UI to one checkbox "Create delegate in source compilation unit"
Support to deprecate the delegator is on the way...
