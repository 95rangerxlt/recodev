1) Start with these two CUs in different packages:

package p1;
class C {
}

package p2;
public class A {
	protected static void foo(int args) {}
	protected static void foo(int args, int moreArgs) {}
	private void bar() {
		foo(5);
		foo(5, 5);
	}
}

2) Select the two "foo" methods in the content outline, and choose Refactor > Move
3) Select p1.C as the destination
4) Click Finish on the refactoring.

-> The resulting code in C.java has compile errors:

package p1;
class C {
	public static void foo(int args) {}
	public public static void foo(int args, int moreArgs) {}
}
