The problem is in the Java content provider. I am adding API to to Team that will simplify visibility determination and then I will create a patch for the Jav content provider that fixes the problem.

Patch

Here's the patch the JDT content provider. I'm not sure if I got every case right with the isVisible checks but it seems to work.
I shoudl add that this patch depends on changes that were just released to HEAD in Team/UI
