Dito for "pulling up" from an interface to a super-interface.

Will this enhancement also go into 3.0 ? 

I ran into this one after extracting some methods into an interface. Later I
added a new method to the original class and I wanted to pull up that method
into the same interface. No luck :( I'm using 3.0 M4

Tobias, we should support pulling up of statics into interfaces. Currently you 
get a strange error message telling that the type doesn't have any super types.

Currently, interfaces are not considered as pull up targets, hence the 
misleading error message.

As far as I can tell, static fields can already be *moved* into interfaces.

For methods, there already exists at least a quick assist "create in super 
type".

(Observed in 3.1 M4)

Pull Up now supports "extracting" methods to interfaces. Pulling up static fields to interfaces is now supported as well.
