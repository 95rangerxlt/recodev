In the following code you can do various extractions on 'A', but most fail as it
seems that it's not allowed to have something else but the enum constant

    private void foo(Enu e) {
        switch (e) {
            case A:
                break;
        }
    }

Tobias, please look for extract local and then pass to Markus for extract
constant. I have a PR for extract method.
Same with Introduce Parameter
Fixed for extract local, extract constant, introduce param > 20050104
Really fixed for all three refactorings in HEAD (with fix of bug 85239).

The original fix did not work when the refactorings were activated via keyboard
shortcut or via workbench window main menu. Added regression tests for extract
constant.
