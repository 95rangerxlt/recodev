I am not exactly sure what "Show All" is supposed to do, but I think it's broken now, with the new java model option in the synchronize view. It seems that "Show All" is doing an intersection of the different view types, instead of a union of them. For me, this ends up being "show less". The best way I can describe this is with a series of screen snapshots. So three snapshots will follow, all of different views of the current incoming and outgoing changes in the swt project.

Note that "Show Java Workspace" makes a typical swt synchronize have way too much "tree"... so I was unable to take a screen snapshot of the whole thing. Obviously, the new java model sync view is suboptimal for swt, so we will probably all change to "Show Workspace", depending on what "Show All" looks like when it is working.

Snap 3) Show All

Note that the folders:
   Eclipse SWT
   Eclipse SWT Browser
   Eclipse SWT Mozilla
   Eclipse SWT PI
are all empty. When I first selected "Show All", those folders all had [+], but clicking on them or selecting "Expand All" just made the [+] go away.
This is the same sync as shown in the previous 2 snapshots - just different views of it - so you can see that some of the changes are not being displayed.
Just noticed that it is all of the incoming changes that are missing from "Show All".
On closer inspection of the "Show Java Workspace" view, I see that the outgoing changes are duplicated. This is not the way the "Package Explorer" works. In the "Package Explorer", files that are on the classpath show up in package folders and packages, and files that are not on the classpath show up below, in regular folders. But files do not show up twice.

The swt project makes a good test case for java model views because of our "different classpath for different platform" setup requirements. Drop by any time for a demo.   :)
The mixed content error has been fixed so that the Java Workspace items should not exclude some resource items. The main issue here appears to be how the Java content provider handles source directories that contain content that is not on the classpath.

Patch
I have attached a patch to JDT/UI that filters out folders that also appear as packages. The patch also fixes the <default package> handling so that the default pakcage only appears when it has childen.
