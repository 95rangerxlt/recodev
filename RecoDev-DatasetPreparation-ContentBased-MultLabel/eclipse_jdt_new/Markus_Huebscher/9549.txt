when the 'new' wizard dialog comes up and you are to choose the wizard to open
go to:
Java
and select TestCase
or TestSuite

the description messages (displayed as the 3rd-top line in the dialog) 
says: 'New TestCase Creation Wizard Page' (and sth similar in the other case)

the standard names would be (see other entries): 'Create a junit test case'
and 'Create a junit test suite'
