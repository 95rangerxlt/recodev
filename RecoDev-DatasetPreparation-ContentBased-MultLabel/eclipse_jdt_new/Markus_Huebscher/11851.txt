It would be nice if the generation of a new test case would do the same as
generation of a new class. The thing which I noticed:

new Class wizards adds javadoc while new Test Case wizard does not.

	/**
	 * Constructor for AA.
	 * @param name
	 */
	public AA(String name) {
		super(name);
	}

Fixed:

* If there is a superclass with constructor SuperClass(String), which is the 
usual case, as TestCase has such a constructor, then the following code is 
generated:

	/**
	 * Constructor for ATest.
	 * @param name
	 */
	public ATest(String name) {
		super(name);
	}

* If no superclass has such a constructor, then this code is generated:
	/**
	 * The name of the test case.
	 */
	private String fName;

	/**
	 * Constructs a test case with the given name.
	 */
	public ATest2(String name) {
		fName = name;
	}


generated new TestCase differes form generated new class
