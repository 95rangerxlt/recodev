patch to override normal BREE method of compiling bundles.

Since we can't seem to specify "JavaSE-1.8" yet for BREE, I suggest we patch this 1.8 bundle to use "SYSTEM" JDK when compiling, and this allows us to use "BREE" elsewhere, as we normally do in our production builds. 

And don't get me wrong ... I don't like this solution :) 
But I hope will be temporary and at same time allow us to do a "full production build". 

It does make the strong assumption that the build is "ran" using Java 8 ... not sure how long that will be valid (or acceptable)? 

But should get us started.

Am I seeing it right? We need this change in org.eclipse.jdt.annotation and NOT org.eclipse.jdt.annotation_v1 ?
Yes, correct. All the other BREEs work fine, it's just that JavaSE-1.8 does not work yet, so this is a way to use a BREE of 1.7, but still have it compiled with 1.8 (and still have other BREEs respected, instead of "turning them all off".
In fact, I opened a "reminder" bug to undo this work-around in about a month ... bug 426902.
