Incremental reflow bug with direction:rtl and bidi-override. b=375716 r=uriber sr=dbaron 
Change the FrameNeedsReflow API to pass the dirty flags to be added directly tothe method, instead of setting them before calling the method.  That way we canavoid reflowing the ancestor of a reflow root which is not itself dirty but hasdirty children.  This also makes it harder to set dirty bits inconsistentlywith the FrameNeedsReflow call.  Bug 378784, r+sr=dbaron, pending rbs' reviewon the mathml parts.

Bug 569719 part 10: refactor parsing of !important and the end of a property declaration. r=dbaron 
Bug 569719 part 11: take the fast path in ParseProperty for !important replacing !important, as well as normal replacing normal. r=dbaron 
Bug 569719 part 12: replace nsCSSParser::ClearTempData with explicit use of mTempData.ClearProperty (and make that method handle shorthands). r=dbaron 
Bug 569719 part 13: move nsCSSParser methods that manipulate data blocks into the appropriate nsCSS*DataBlock classes. r=dbaron

Make nsIDOMSVGCSS2Properties use the specialized shorter quickstubs.  (Bug 584301)  r=bzbarsky 
Remove the MOZ_WIDGET_TOOLKIT backwards-compatibility definition in the reftest condition sandbox.  (Bug 570329)  r=roc 
Fix processing of matrix() transform functions to handle calc() rather than asserting.  (Bug 584569)  r=bzbarsky 
Fix assertion about float manager state by restoring old float manager state when we place a float and then cancel that placement.  (Bug 563584, patch 1)  r=roc 
Remove aForceFit/aRelaxHeightConstraint concept from float reflow, since we now split floats rather than push them to the next page (and correct propagation of nsHTMLReflowState::mFlags::mIsTopOfPage will force fitting when we need to).  (Bug 563584, patch 2)  r=roc 
Most of CanPlaceFloat is unnecessary given the float placement rules (in particular, that the top of a float cannot be higher than the top of any prior left or right float) and the fact that we now split floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 3)  r=roc 
Test coverage for this is in the future patch "Add reftests for bug 563584.". 
Replace force-fit with setting mIsTopOfPage correctly.  (Bug 563584, patch 5)  r=roc 
When we're in columns (and therefore not splitting floats), push floats that don't fit to the next column.  (Bug 563584, patch 6)  r=roc 
Use an AutoRestore to restore mY in nsBlockReflowState::FlowAndPlaceFloat.  (Bug 563584, patch 7)  r=roc 
Remove initialization to value that doesn't make much sense and never matters.  (Bug 563584, patch 8)  r=roc 
Allow the float manager to record that a float has been pushed past a break.  (Bug 563584, patch 9)  r=roc 
Add the optimization mentioned in the previous patch, so we don't have to iterate all floats to determine if one was split.  (Bug 563584, patch 10)  r=roc 
Don't try to clear pushed floats when computing the final size of blocks.  Fixes scrollbar on layout/reftests/bugs/563584-6-columns.html .  (Bug 563584, patch 11)  r=roc 
Make nsFrameList::RemoveFramesAfter(nsnull) remove the whole list.  (Bug 563584, patch 11.5)  r=roc 
Track which frames were float continuations that need to be pulled to the next block rather than figuring it out again when it's time to pull them.  (This allows first-in-flows to be float continuations.)  (Bug 563584, patch 12)  r=roc 
Manage float continuations to-be-pulled by the next-in-flow better by keeping them in a separate frame list until they're actually pulled.  (Bug 563584, patch 13)  r=roc 
nsBlockFrame::ReflowFloatContinuations doesn't need anything in AddFloat other than FlowAndPlaceFloat.  (Bug 563584, patch 14)  r=roc 
Steal float back before reflowing it, in order to allow first continuation of a float to be pushed to the next page.  (Bug 563584, patch 15)  r=roc 
Save float's next sibling since reflowing it could change the next sibling.  (Bug 563584, patch 16)  r=roc 
Don't propagate the float's reflow status through places that expect an inline's reflow status, to avoid the assertion for which bug 563584 was filed.  This separates pushing of floats from pushing of lines, and allows first-in-flow floats to be pushed to the next page without their associated line.  (Bug 563584, patch 17)  r=roc 
Do the same for PlaceBelowCurrentLineFloats:  don't propagate the truncation of a float into the line's reflow status.  (Bug 563584, patch 18)  r=roc 
Rename PushTruncatedPlaceholderLine since the remaining reasons for lines being truncated are related to being next to floats, not having truncated floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 19)  r=roc 
Remove aReflowStatus parameters made unnecessary by previous patch.  (Bug 563584, patch 20)  r=roc 
Add checks to VerifyList that previous siblings match next siblings.  (Bug 563584, patch 21)  r=roc 
Pass correct *remaining* height to float manager, rather than the whole height of the content area.  (Bug 563584, patch 22)  r=roc 
Adjust reftest assertion manifests for churn in nscoord_MAX-related assertions (which includes 'computed overflow area' assertion, because of width wraparound in UnionRect making overflow area empty).  (Bug 563584, patch 23)  r=roc 
Add bit to lines indicating that they may have a placeholder for a float that was pushed to the next line (and bump the child count up to 32 bits).  (Bug 563584, patch 24)  r=roc 
In a constrained height situation, we need to reflow anything with floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 25)  Fixes assertion on layout/generic/crashtests/408883-1.html .  r=roc 
Don't split floats when we're not paginating.  (Bug 563584, patch 26)  Fixes assertion on layout/generic/crashtests/461294-1.html .  r=roc 
Add testcase to check that mIsTopOfPage is false when reflowing blocks that have clearance.  (There was originally a patch here, but it seems not to be needed, so now it's just tests.)  (Bug 563584, patch 27) 
Add comment describing mIsTopOfPage better.  (Bug 563584, patch 28)  r=roc 
Don't switch a constrained height to an unconstrained one due to infinite clearance.  Fixes layout/reftests/bugs/563584-10b.html .  (Bug 563584, patch 29)  r=roc 
Set incomplete status when we have continuations that we shouldn't destroy.  Fixes assertion on layout/generic/crashtests/469859-1.xhtml .  (Bug 563584, patch 30)  r=roc 
Add reftests for bug 563584.  (Bug 563584, patch 31)  r=roc 
Don't force availableHeight to be nonnegative, because doing so means that we'll place zero height blocks (including their non-zero-height contents) at the bottom of a page when there's not room (see nsHTMLReflowState::SetTruncated).  (Bug 563584, patch 32)  r=roc 
This patch was generated with the following sed commands on layout/generic/*.{h,cpp}: 's/FLOAT_CONTINUATION/PUSHED_FLOAT/g;s/FloatContinuation/PushedFloat/g;s/float continuation/pushed float/g' plus whitespace fixup where the frame state bits are defined.

Handle failure of GatherIdent, which can (starting with the next patch) fail when the character sequence is not an identifier.  Additionally, change the tokenization of a hash (#) followed by a non-name character or EOF to tokenize as DELIM (eCSSToken_Symbol) rather than as eCSSToken_Hash.  This only changes the behavior in the EOF case, because the only caller (color parsing) that accepts eCSSToken_Hash (rather than only eCSSToken_ID) checks the length.
