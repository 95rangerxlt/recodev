I'm adding asserts about when we do and don't have a Location object behind the wrapper, and this case was hitting them. What we do here doesn't so much matter given how this stuff all works. On the one hand, statically using a restrictive policy is slightly more defense-in-depth. On the other hand, if this stuff is broken we're screwed in much more serious ways than content reading chrome locations, and using a consistent wrapper scheme allows us to make stronger asserts and assumptions.
The current situation seems incorrect, especially given the behavior of CrossOriginWrapper and XrayProxy. Currently it doesn't matter, but it probably will in the future.
