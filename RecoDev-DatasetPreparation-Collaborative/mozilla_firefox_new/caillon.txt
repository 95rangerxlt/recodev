Bug 421303 Crash [@ jsds_ScriptHookProc] r=caillon a=dsicore If we reach ~jsdService, that means our client doesn't care about us, so we can (and should) drop all references to any callbacks (if they cared, they'd have kept us alive!*). I think jsdService::Off should clear all the hooks, the strange magic of not clearing it isn't really a great idea. So for Off, we'll now clear the ScriptHook too (consumers who use off should really drop any references they have to our objects...). I'm still on the fence on this point, I suspect we can actually move it from ::Off to ~jsdService (it must be cleared at some point, otherwise if jsd_xpc's library manages to get unloaded, the function pointer would be invalid, which would be *BAD*). jsds_NotifyPendingDeadScripts needs to clear gDeadScripts whether or not there's a service or hooks, so it does. Because it's a static callback and because of the scary way GC works, I'd rather ensure (deathgrip) that jsds is available (and consistent!) for the duration of the function call. The code already handles the lack of a hook, so there's no reason to do magical returns.... The real problem which mayhemer found was that jsdService::Off was returning early (failure) because gGCStatus wasn't JSGC_END when called from ~jsdService from JS_GC from the cyclecollector, so we make sure that ~jsdService forces ::Off to act as if it is JSGC_END (after ensuring that there are no callbacks available). * a pure javascript (xpcom component, not DOM hosted!) version of a jsdService consumer means that jsdService will need to talk to the CycleCollector eventually (this is another bug for the future).
