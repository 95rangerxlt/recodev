Change plugin unloading behavior to never unload plugins by default. Prior to this patch plugins were unloaded whenever their last instance was destroyed. The old behavior meant that going from one page with a Flash instance to another page with a Flash instance would shut down the entire Flash plugin instead of just destroying one instance and starting another. The new behavior dramatically cuts down on plugin loading/unloading activity.

Prior to this patch, a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack on SSL could cause GMPInstallManager to fail during the check for updates, which in turn would cause a crash during shutdown. This was observed in the wild by users of recent versions of Avast, which performs such attacks on SSL as part of its "HTTPS scanning" feature. With this patch, errors are handled more gracefully. The attack still prevents any update (including the install of OpenH264) but at least it does not cause a crash anymore.

When workers shut down we discard the event queue rather than running it to completion.  Originally workers managed their event queue themselves and would simply iterate through the array of events and cancel them all.  After bug 914762 this was done by setting a (thread-)global "canceling" flag and then calling NS_ProcessPendingEvents.  But this neglects that a shut down request can be received while the worker is in a sync queue.  In this case, calling NS_ProcessPendingEvents will process any events pending in the sync queue, which is *not* the queue we need to cancel.
