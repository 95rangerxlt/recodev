Bug 982115 - PlacesTransactions: (1) Decouple |transact| and |batch|, and make batch work like Task.spawn, rather than the custom solution we had so far (yielding transactions rather than calling |transact| for the batched transactions). so that |transact| may be called during a batch from any function, not limiting the batch 'context' to the function passed to |batch|; (2) Rename the uri input property to URL, and allow passing DOM URL objects for it (in addition to plain specs and nsIURI objects) - this matches recent Bookmark.jsm and History.jsm work; (3) Improve the module documentation. r=mak.
