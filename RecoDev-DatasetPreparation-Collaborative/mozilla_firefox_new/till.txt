Bug 224829 - docshell should not require non-gecko interface nsIBrowserHistory. This was fixed by introducing a new interface nsIGlobalHistory2 to replace the current nsIGlobalHistory. There are two-way adapters so that the frozen interface still works. r=biesi sr=bz a=mscott for toolkit/ changes.

Backing out bug 400902. Something's still screwy :-( 
Bug 421303 Crash [@ jsds_ScriptHookProc] r=caillon a=dsicore If we reach ~jsdService, that means our client doesn't care about us, so we can (and should) drop all references to any callbacks (if they cared, they'd have kept us alive!*). I think jsdService::Off should clear all the hooks, the strange magic of not clearing it isn't really a great idea. So for Off, we'll now clear the ScriptHook too (consumers who use off should really drop any references they have to our objects...). I'm still on the fence on this point, I suspect we can actually move it from ::Off to ~jsdService (it must be cleared at some point, otherwise if jsd_xpc's library manages to get unloaded, the function pointer would be invalid, which would be *BAD*). jsds_NotifyPendingDeadScripts needs to clear gDeadScripts whether or not there's a service or hooks, so it does. Because it's a static callback and because of the scary way GC works, I'd rather ensure (deathgrip) that jsds is available (and consistent!) for the duration of the function call. The code already handles the lack of a hook, so there's no reason to do magical returns.... The real problem which mayhemer found was that jsdService::Off was returning early (failure) because gGCStatus wasn't JSGC_END when called from ~jsdService from JS_GC from the cyclecollector, so we make sure that ~jsdService forces ::Off to act as if it is JSGC_END (after ensuring that there are no callbacks available). * a pure javascript (xpcom component, not DOM hosted!) version of a jsdService consumer means that jsdService will need to talk to the CycleCollector eventually (this is another bug for the future). 
Bug 199692 - Update and reenable the document.elementFromPoint tests that didn't work when initially committed due to window sizing issues; there may still be some issues, but we'll todo aggressively in followup commits if necessary -- better halfway in than not at all.

Still some indent fixes 
still Bug 430980, fix indent. 
First stage of loop table work; bitmap free space management and GC hook-up still to come. 
More work on tracing EQUALITY_OP.  Still need to synthesize LIR_ne before it
Flag ints as type INT in the incoming context if its merely a double holding an int that was too large to fit into jsval directly. Along the side exits make sure we can properly box oversized ints (by casting them to doubles). The fetch_int/store_int paths still need fixing to ensure that values are merely passed through (prim_copy) instead of explicit casting or calling to ValueToECMAInt32 etc. 
Make trace-code 32-bit clean and extend interpreter state to carry the current context (cx). The recorder still has to record a 31-bit int path through the loop, but the emitted code is able to stay in the tree even if values bump over to 32-bit ints. 
Strength reduce i2f(doubleToInt32(x)) and u2f(doubleToUint32(x)) to x. This eliminate most of the on-trace overhead, but we still need type peeling of loop variable into int to win back the performance loss casting introduced. 
Indentation and comment wrapping (at 79, 99 looks too long and most comments still avoid going past 80+/-). 
Prime the page cache during VM startup. This makes us eat the page cache allocation overhead there instead of during the first use. This is just a hotfix. We still need a rewrite of the page cache. 
Still trying to get the ARM register updating right. 
Fix incProp to box and store (incElem still todo). 
Improve js_IsLoopExit (unannotated JSOP_GOTO is still ambiguous). 
merge (still not working, probably box/unbox dumbness) 
tighten up some bounds, still not quite right 
Try to fix SwitchNativeGlobalFrame, still studying it but these changes seem necessary. 
- Use GCF_DONT_BLOCK from fastcall builtins that call into the GC allocator (mostly; a few places need help still, or better: need to avoid allocation).
Abort recording if unwinding from js_Interpret to js_Invoke and still recording (this can happen via fun.call/.apply). Also assert in threaded interpreter BEGIN_CASE and DO_OP (from END_CASE) that we either have no recorder or are using the recordingJumpTable. 
Added bitsinbyte-ish testcase to trace-test.js. This currently still crashes the VM in nested mode. 
Write back outer tree frames, but exclude the current frame (which the next tree will do). This still crashes the trace-tests.js test case with nesting enabled and for the life of me I can't figure out why (try with TRACEMONKEY=nesting). 
Fixed some bugs in the AMD64 port, still crash in 5 sunspider tests. 
Restore state.sp and state.rp before the nested guard exit point so we can have a sequence of them and still have rp/sp adjusted correctly. 
1. Add activeCallOrGlobalSlot, used by JSOP_NAME, JSOP_CALLNAME, etc. recorders to cope with Call objects on the scope chain, if they represent still-active frames covered by callDepth.

Remove the view-source: part of the URL to stop the test leaking; most of the patch to bug 206691 is still tested anyway 
Update trace-test.js jitstats for testThinLoopDemote to account for upvar2, although there's still some wonkiness here being tracked in bug 486820.  r=orange 
Create a new method FixInvalidFrecencies that finds invalid (negative) frecencies and recalculates them. Use it for handling creating/migrating DBs as well as recalculating invalid places on daily idle (place frecencies are already estimated by decay). This obviates a few preferences, queries and methods related to recalculating on idle. The test uses mork history with a number of pages that now all get their frecencies calculated on migrate, where before this fix, the test fails with a bunch of pages still with negative frecencies. 
Item list hidden behind expander/progressive disclosure button, added a warning when clearing all history, added a tree view for selecting a fine-grained timespan.  We decided to remove the tree view at the last minute; code is still there but #ifdef'ed out.

Fixed some minor errors in cookieStore / cookieSyncCore (still getting used to the getter idiom in javascript -- had too many underscores).  Syncing cookies now works in as much as it can upload all cookies to the server without raising any exceptions; now to see if it can download and merge cookies on the other side... 
- turning in the bookmarks sharing UI, although it's still not fully functional. 
Another idea I had was to actually match calls to self.cb with calls to 'yield' to automatically detect e.g. two yields in a row (which will ordinarily result in a generator 'hanging'), a generator exiting while a self.cb still hasn't been called, but I'm not sure what kinds of reprecussions it may have. 
async.js now keeps track of how many outstanding callbacks it has and uses this information to log warnings about coroutines that may have yielded without an outstanding callback, and coroutines that may have finished while a callback is still outstanding.  These are merely 'warnings' rather than certainties because this code assumes that there is a 1:1 correspondence between accesses to self.cb and yields, and also that self.cb's are actually passed to asynchronous functions.  It'd be really cool if we could actually keep track of whether a callback got garbage collected before it was called or something, though I don't know how much it'd help in the end. 
Implemented _stopOutgoingShare (though it's still not being called from anywhere). 
Separated test_passwords into itself, which contains pure unit tests, and test_password_syncing, which contains a suite that's more along the lines of a system test, though still with plenty of stuff faked-out.  fake_login_manager.js contains code shared between the two suites. 
Partial bustage fix: test was broken, is now less broken but still fails. 
test_passphrase_checking now actually tests real code and shows that it works. Still have to move isPassphraseValid() into a different place though, probably crypto. 
Fixed a todo in test_bookmark_sharing, still more left to do as jono's modifications to the bookmark sharing API change. 
The old "syncOnQuit.enabled" preference now controls if Weave will actually perform a full sync on quit or not. If false, no sync is started, but we still wait for an active sync to finish, if waitOnQuit.enable is true.
- minor clean up of passphrase verification in the wizard. passphrase verification is still a bit buggy though... 
attempt at fixing login/server setup, needs more work still 
build system updates (still WIP) 
Get rid of Filters and automatically JSON.stringify PUT/POST data that aren't strings, so plain Records can be passed in to PUT and POST. This leverages toJSON of Records to provide an object that can be serialized. Fix up client record serialize/deserialize to still escape/unescape non-ASCII. 
Create records with the correct parent/pred if it's still waiting for them to sync. 
Keep track of previously opened windows of pages that should only have one instance open and close the old one if it's still open. 
Add some account creation error handling, but it's still pretty clunky with username detection and alerts for other stuff. 
Have the syncInterval getter return with a lower interval for non-mobile clients while still enforcing backoff if it's bigger than the sync interval. 
bug 521357 - handle login errors in the main prefpane better, still needs work after pre2 
Add a tri-state pref that is unset, 0, or a number (modified time in seconds) and don't show the notification if it's in the "0" state. Unset pref means no modified time has been saved, and a non-0 state is the modified time of the last synced tab. So when tabs arrive with a different modified time, switch to the 0 state. Additionally, still remember if the user ever dismissed the notification and never show it again. 
Don't have each engine reset their last sync but still have the service clear out its cached data (keys, records). 
Return any value provided by the base form implementation while making sure we still notify before and after the call. 
Trace pageshow events to indicate that new tab data should be uploaded. Because scores must be integers, still increment the score by 1, but only do that 10% of the time for pageshows.

Rename XRE_AddComponentLocation to XRE_AddManifestLocation to better-convey what it actually does now (it still auto-registers XPT files when passed a directory, but we may get rid of that as well and just fold those into components.manifest), as noted in bug 568691 comment 58. 
* The extension manager still restarts. I need to solve a problem re-reading default preferences from extensions.
We still have a few local patches that have not yet been upstreamed, but they're all up in the Breakpad issue tracker now:
Back out changeset 5f425aecd7ab again. Still has performance issues; 14% in ThisObject hook. 
Bug 573268 - The XPTI rewrite caused an (intentional) leak at shutdown; free this data only in trace-malloc builds so that leakstats are still useful. r=dbaron 
Bug 564991. Part 40: ThebesLayers painted with variable opacity can still be OPAQUE_CONTENT themselves. r=bas 
Bug 578751: Use @loader_path instead of @executable_path on Mac OS X. Committing as a bustage fix, still needs review.

Bug 577486. Load the RtlCaptureContext entry point manually so that we can still run on Windows 2000. (patch modified to review comments by tnikkel) r=ted a=blocking 
+ Added sanity checks on data going to and from storage (still some work to be done there); if the check doesn't pass, the data isn't loaded/saved
Bug 577387: iQ.each is gone! iQ(...).each still exists, and its callback must now explicitly take the element as its argument 
+ The Groups object now keeps an array of groups. This is more robust than counting DOM elements, for instance when a group is fading away (you want to act like it doesn't exist, even though its DOM element is still on the screen)
+ Improved Tabs.tab() (though it's still kind of a hack); new tabs weren't being hooked up properly 
+ The container for a Group now encompasses its whole bounds; the titlebar is within it rather than outside of it. This is a cleaner structure, and fixes some issues with the titlebar, as well as allowing us to see the red glow for when a group will be dropped into another group. There are still some issues, but I think we'll leave them until we have a visual design. 
+ When you close the active group, it was still being remembered as the active group (even though it didn't exist anymore); fixed.
+ Adds an new-tab animation that Feels Right(tm) [although the timing might still need tweaking]
+ Added sanity checks on data going to and from storage (still some work to be done there); if the check doesn't pass, the data isn't loaded/saved
+ The "zoom prep", where the div is resized behind the scenes, is now much more robust; items can be rearranged while in this state (in response to new tabs opening, for instance), and everything still works out.
 - The bite still exist, it just gets smaller. 
+ fixed: Bug 576786 - Resizing sometimes gets stuck in a state where it thinks we're still dragging, though we're not. 
+ close buttons on tabs are still not showing correctly.  Add a bunch
Bug 577387: iQ.each is gone! iQ(...).each still exists, and its callback must now explicitly take the element as its argument 
Don't save gWindow.tabcandyBrowserWindow but still create the BrowserWindow object for events.

Bug 572042: get tracing+fat values to build in the browser. As part of this I disabled the quickstub traceable natives. According to Andreas, we don't necessarily need them for good perf now that we can call the standard quickstub from trace. This build works on simple JS, but there are still bugs (e.g., Google Maps asserts). 
Drop the distinction in js::Value of funobj vs. nonfunobj.  Instead, values can just have JSVAL_TYPE_OBJECT.  The trace-jit still uses funobj/nonfunobj and translates as necessary. 
Get merge building js shell and passing trace/ref tests.  Still need to fix up browser

Followup to bug 596451 part E (cset 37188e297b07) - double-pass painting is still used for in-process plugins, so fix the test expectations accordingly. 
This changeset only implements asynchronous painting for out-of-process plugins. In-process painting will be implemented as a followup. Note that it is still possible to disable asynchronous layers on Windows by setting the preference mozilla.plugins.use_layers to false, but my intention is to remove this preference and sync-painting codepaths soon in a followup. 
SyncEngine now uses the getChangedIDs() method to get all changed IDs before a sync. By default this still goes through the tracker, but engines can override this method to do queries based on timestamps, or to bypass the tracker entirely.

Currently, JS::Rooted<JSObject*> requires the full definition of JSObject to be available (due to RootMethods<JSObject*>::kind() calling JSObject::rootKind()). This patch switches to using a RootKind<T> template that is explicitly specialized in jspubtd.h for externally-visible pointer types, but still falls back on T::rootKind() for other pointer types so that we don't need to explicitly specialize on eg all subclasses of JSString or JSObject.

Prior to this patch, a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack on SSL could cause GMPInstallManager to fail during the check for updates, which in turn would cause a crash during shutdown. This was observed in the wild by users of recent versions of Avast, which performs such attacks on SSL as part of its "HTTPS scanning" feature. With this patch, errors are handled more gracefully. The attack still prevents any update (including the install of OpenH264) but at least it does not cause a crash anymore.

This makes the color matrix and component transfer Moz2D filters generate an infinite output, which is then cropped to the primitive's filter primitive subregion by a subsequent crop filter node. This still gives us different behavior than other browser when the primitive subregion is overridden using the x/y/width/height attributes - other browsers either ignore those completely (IE) or only let them crop the default subregion (which is defined to be the same as the input subregion) and not enlargen it - but I'll fix that in a separate bug.
