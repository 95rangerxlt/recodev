fix warning from bug 374883, r=marria 
Bug 295355 - Play minimize sound when we're hacking the working set. r=emaijala sr=bryner 
Initial add of new (work-in-progress) password manager implementation.  Not part of the build. 
passwordmgr.properties, not satchel.properties 
Adapt wallet's password manager UI (removing the form manager bits).  Split into content and locale directories and add contents.rdf files for passwordmgr chrome package. 
Lots of changes and bugfixes: - Enable multiple username support by listening to change events for the username field when there is more than one stored login for the form. - Make the signon hashtable store a SignonHashEntry, which has a pointer to the first SignonDataEntry.  This lets us adjust the head of the linked list without a hashtable operation, and also fixes a case where we would continue using a deleted entry, leading to a crash.- Change FindPasswordEntryFromSignonData to FnidPasswordEntryInternal, and refactor it a bit.- Clean up prefill logic so that multiple forms on a page could be prefilled.- Fix bug where the last input was used as the username field, instead of the input just before the password.- Make sure we write out all entries for each realm.- Make sure we include all entries in each realm when returning an enumerator.- Remove some form manager cruft I missed in passwordManager.js. 
Make removal of stored logins play nicer with the tree widget.  Do a (batched) notification of the treeBoxObject that the row count is changing when deleting one or more stored logins.  Also do a rowCountChanged notification when removing all stored logins.

Backout 815b5a243315 (bug 781213) for xpcshell failures 
in bug 273336.  At that time this code probably lived in libxpcom and needed to
used, as far as I can see in the gecko-dev history, other than in bug 206029,
Bug 206029 was working around the Flash player installer modifying Firefox's
omni.ja, so obviously, bug 206029 doesn't actually apply anymore.
