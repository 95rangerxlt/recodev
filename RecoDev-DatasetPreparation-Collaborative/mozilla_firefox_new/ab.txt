Lots of changes and bugfixes: - Enable multiple username support by listening to change events for the username field when there is more than one stored login for the form. - Make the signon hashtable store a SignonHashEntry, which has a pointer to the first SignonDataEntry.  This lets us adjust the head of the linked list without a hashtable operation, and also fixes a case where we would continue using a deleted entry, leading to a crash.- Change FindPasswordEntryFromSignonData to FnidPasswordEntryInternal, and refactor it a bit.- Clean up prefill logic so that multiple forms on a page could be prefilled.- Fix bug where the last input was used as the username field, instead of the input just before the password.- Make sure we write out all entries for each realm.- Make sure we include all entries in each realm when returning an enumerator.- Remove some form manager cruft I missed in passwordManager.js.

Bug 235243: Need drag and drop feedback for toolbar bookmarks (and menuitem bookmarks for gtk2). In addition to the DND feedback, this patch: - introduces a new var 'BookmarksInsertion' that 'encapsulates' DND feedback display. - rewrite the rtl handling related to DND. BookmarksInsertion deals with this subtleties and the "public" feedback orientation ("before"|"on"|"after") returned by BookmarksInsertion.getOrientation refers now to the DOM. - paste and copy commands on the menus now insert after the rclicked element. The hack that appended everything at the end of the container has been removed or more accurately replaced by another one that is at least invisible to the user and we already used for DND. The problem is due a problem with the content building of containers with siblings (open in tabs stuff) not generated by the bookmarks template. - usual small glitch fixing.

* Menu of -D flags for enabling instrumentation, as a commented-out CFLAGS +=   setting for convenient testing. * js_FindProperty and js_LookupPropertyWithFlags return indexes into the scope   and prototype chains, respectively, to support internal instrumentation, and   to pave the way for the return of the property cache (bug 365851).. * jsutil.[ch] JSBasicStats struct and functions for computing mean/sigma/max   and auto-scaling histogram. * JS_SCOPE_DEPTH_METER instrumentation for compile- and run-time scope chain   length instrumentation: + At compile time, rt->hostenvScopeDepthStats and rt->lexicalScopeDepthStats   meter scope chains passed into the compile and evaluate APIs. + At runtime, rt->protoLookupDepthStats and rt->scopeSearchDepthStats track   steps along the prototype and scope chains until the sought-after property   is found. * JS_ARENAMETER uses JSBasicStats now. * Added rt->liveScopePropsPreSweep to fix the property tree stats code that   rotted when property tree sweeping moved to after the finalization phase. * Un-bitrotted some DEBUG_brendan code, turned some off for myself via XXX. * Mac OS X toolchain requires initialized data shared across dynamic library   member files, outlaws common data, so initialize extern metering vars. * Old HASHMETER code in jshash.[ch] is now JS_HASHMETER-controlled and based   on JSBasicStats. * DEBUG_scopemeters macro renamed JS_DUMP_SCOPE_METERS; uses JSBasicStats now. * Disentangle DEBUG and DUMP_SCOPE_STATS (now JS_DUMP_PROPTREE_STATS) and fix   inconsistent thread safety for liveScopeProps (sometimes atomic-incremented,   sometimes runtime-locked). * Compiler-modeled maxScopeDepth will propagate via JSScript to runtime for   capability-based, interpreter-inlined cache hit qualifier bits, to bypass   scope and prototype chain lookup by optimizing for common monomorphic get,   set, and call site referencing a prototype property in a well-named object   (no shadowing or mutation in 99.9% of the cases).

Bug 421774 consolidate jsd static variables into main r=shaver 
Bug 421303 Crash [@ jsds_ScriptHookProc] r=caillon a=dsicore If we reach ~jsdService, that means our client doesn't care about us, so we can (and should) drop all references to any callbacks (if they cared, they'd have kept us alive!*). I think jsdService::Off should clear all the hooks, the strange magic of not clearing it isn't really a great idea. So for Off, we'll now clear the ScriptHook too (consumers who use off should really drop any references they have to our objects...). I'm still on the fence on this point, I suspect we can actually move it from ::Off to ~jsdService (it must be cleared at some point, otherwise if jsd_xpc's library manages to get unloaded, the function pointer would be invalid, which would be *BAD*). jsds_NotifyPendingDeadScripts needs to clear gDeadScripts whether or not there's a service or hooks, so it does. Because it's a static callback and because of the scary way GC works, I'd rather ensure (deathgrip) that jsds is available (and consistent!) for the duration of the function call. The code already handles the lack of a hook, so there's no reason to do magical returns.... The real problem which mayhemer found was that jsdService::Off was returning early (failure) because gGCStatus wasn't JSGC_END when called from ~jsdService from JS_GC from the cyclecollector, so we make sure that ~jsdService forces ::Off to act as if it is JSGC_END (after ensuring that there are no callbacks available). * a pure javascript (xpcom component, not DOM hosted!) version of a jsdService consumer means that jsdService will need to talk to the CycleCollector eventually (this is another bug for the future).

First round of macro cleanups to enable tracing. 
Opcodes that can be traced through can be declared with TRACE_CASE(op). Currently all opcodes are declared as BEGIN_CASE(op), which automatically aborts trace recording. In addition, error handlers (defined with DEFINE_HANDLER) also abort trace recording. At every backwards branch trigger monitor_branch(), which will monitor for new trace tree anchors. 
Enable tracing for selected opcodes that do not have any remaining tracing hazards. 
Make branch instructions traceable using a new primitive guard_boolean_is_true. 
Mark getting and setting arguments and local variables as safe for tracing. 
Make relational operations (<,<=,>,>=) traceable. 
Style (and substance for vim users: left brace opening in column 1 enables [[ navigation). 
Instrument loop headers with jsvals above fp->vars and below fp->spbase. 
Add a per-runtime loop attribute table that associates a jsval attribute with every loop in the code. The jsval is used initially as a counter until a certain threshold is reached, at which point the loop is traced and compiled and the resulting native code object is stored in the jsval to be executed for future encounters of the loop. 
The table is now per-thread in a multi-threaded environment, and per-runtime otherwise. During code generation we merely allocate a loop table slot to each loop. Each thread will enlarge the table as needed in JSOP_HEADER. 
Assign fresh loop table slots for all JSOP_HEADER opcodes in a script as it is thawed since the slots we stored there are likely stale by now. 
Style (and substance for vim users: left brace opening in column 1 enables [[ navigation). 
Instrument loop headers with jsvals above fp->vars and below fp->spbase. 
Merge and undo js_AllocateLoopTableSlot reparam. 
Fiddle loop table slot interface and impl in hope of freeing slots over time. 
First stage of loop table work; bitmap free space management and GC hook-up still to come. 
Disable JSOP_HEADER counting. 
Allow recorder to abort recording. 
Expand tabs. 
Track data flow through variables in the recorder. Set an error flag if the recorder signals an error. 
Use an error property in the recorder instead of a return value to indicate errors and make sure DO_OP aborts the trace once we go into the error state in the tracer. 
Notify the recorder of all primitives as they are recorded. If the recorder doesn't support a primitive we abort the trace. In debugging mode this also stops the VM. 
Added new primitive guard_can_do_fast_inc_dec and report reason for trace aborts. 
Make fast inc/dec traceable. 
Write back stack/local variable state in the trace code and improved redundand boxing/unboxing elimination. 
Add license block-comment, expand tabs. 
Allocate recorder dynamically to avoid having a vtable in the struct holding the reference. Emit writebacks for every update to the tracker, not just stack writes. 
Add a new option -j to enable the JIT. The default is off so we can easily benchmark the overhead without the tracer. 
rename ENABLE_TRACER to TRACING_ENABLED and explicitly parameterize on cx 
abort tracing if we see an XML object in an equality op 
Implement icmp_ne (in terms of LIR_ugt(i, 0)!) and make JSOP_NE traceable. 
Cleanup trace abort/end code. 
suite failures for -L lc2 lc3 spidermonkey-n slow-n, probably needs some guard
Initialize jump table when side-entering the interpreter. Keep track of cx and sp directly in the recorder instead of going through the tracker. 
When a conditional branch instructions terminates the trace, we have to make sure its restartable, so put the conditional value it was deciding on back onto the stack by incrementing sp before jumping back to the outer interpreter. 
Disable fusing of conditional check and branch when recording. 
Save the side exit state at entry in to the opcode (since we want to restart ops) and enable store filter. 
Save the VM registers into markRegs at opcode entry and restore that state when ending or aborting recording. The same info is pushed into sideexit and used by guards. With this change we can eliminate the hack in MONITOR_BRANCH that had to adjust the stack pointer depending on the opcode type, and it also allows us to trace through the recently added boolean guard opcode fusing. This improves trace code quality, since only the pre-conditional check state is saved. The guard restores into that state, so the trace code doesn't have to emit the value of the conditional evaluation onto the stack, saving a handful ops. 
label arg/var/stack/sp/state for easier trace-reading 
Fix deallocation bug in the recorder. We will have to lift more code Tamarin's Interpreter to stabilize the recording. 
beginning of trace-capability regression minisuite; will crash you today! 
Add type stability check for loop variables. Rename readstack to import. 
Fix type stability check. 
Fix unstable trace rejection for optimized build. 
Extend dispatch table to include 256 extra cases for traceing. 
Create a stub for each opcode in TraceRecorder and invoke them from the stubs that are pointed to by the recorder dispatch-table. 
Properly switch tracer on and off depending on loopEdge and abort signaling from trace recorder recording functions. 
Make trace-code 32-bit clean and extend interpreter state to carry the current context (cx). The recorder still has to record a 31-bit int path through the loop, but the emitted code is able to stay in the tree even if values bump over to 32-bit ints. 
Try to keep 64-bit portability via size_t instead of unsigned, jsuword for uintptr instead of long, etc. 
Added support for semi-stable loop variables. Compiling for(...) q += 2.5; is ridiculously difficult because it flip-flops between int and double. Add support to promote integer values to doubles at the loop tail if at loop entry we expect a double. Since this isn't possible the other way around, we have to get luck that we catch a path into the loop where q is already double. For this we add 3 trigger points (10, 13, 37). We will try three times to record a trace at those iteration counts of a loop. If none succeed the loop is blacklisted. This probably needs more tuning down the road. 
Move the type level from int/double to number. All traces start out as double in all slots, and denote and promote to/from int as needed. The FuncFilter optimizes on-trace casting and elininates redundant f->i-> chains. More optimization needed on this of course, and this code is now a bit slower than the previous integer-register use. However, this does solve the q += 2.5 issues. The heap access code does not properly cast yet and is likely unstable. 
Strength reduce BoxDouble(i2f(x)) to BoxInt32(x). Make sure loop indexes are actually integers. This guard will be eliminated further down in the pipeline if we decided to peel the type of the loop variable (index) down to integer. 
Strength reduce i2f(doubleToInt32(x)) and u2f(doubleToUint32(x)) to x. This eliminate most of the on-trace overhead, but we still need type peeling of loop variable into int to win back the performance loss casting introduced. 
Added loop-tail driven context slot type demotion. Without all the buzzwords, what this essentially means is that we detect if the last value that the trace leaves in a slot (which is the value that flows along the backedge back to the loop header) is known to originate from an integer value via i2f, we flag the slot as type integer and recompile the trace. We do this where type stability is certain (result of an and, i.e.) or where its very likely (++operator). If the speculation fails, the same analysis flags the slot as blocked, which means it will always be double. The hope is that this analysis converges quickly (1-2 recompilations tops). 
Removed an unused variable from the avmplus glue code. 
Unbox global variables onto the native stack and re-box them. This has certain synchronization implications but will make top-level scripts quite a bit faster. 
more detailed type-instability diagnostics 
Hack: demotable stores have to be flagged as int in the exit typemap. This needs cleanup. 
Merged with tamarin-tracing (Moved SideExit and GuardRecord out of nanojit, improved labelling) 
sp_adj is now maintained in bytes, not words, so +8 is now the magic value to point to the top of the stack. All stores above that watermark are eliminated by StackFilter in nanojit. 
Move builtin[] table in jsbuiltin.cpp 
Fixed name/setname code to just track the value move instead of touching memory since we have global variables in our native frame now. We have to fix the page cache issues before we can benchmark this. 
MSVC knows about intptr_t, and doesn't like our remix 
Root all strings and objects first when unboxing. Then box values that might trigger the GC (doubles/ints). This probably needs some performance tuning over time. 
Fixed guarding of eq+ifeq/ifne fusions and enabled tracing JSOP_GOTO (no-op)

Brendan fixed global variable access in non-top level code so re-enable that in trace-test.js. We pass all of shaver's trace torture tests. 
Windows cares a lot more about where FASTCALL is; such a sensitive platform 
Incomplete stab at CALLPROP, added ABORT_TRACE for better diagnostics, make math_sin non-static in preparation for specializing call. 
Backed out changeset 2af185cb0fb7. We will map in global variabls different so we don't need the higher ngvars count to find globals in the native frame. 
more ABORT_TRACE instrumentation (some should be asserts?) 
fix scalpel left in nativeFrameSlots from aborted thisp addition to frame 
Enable inlining for calls. Deep bailouts (from within side exits) are generated but are not allowed to be ever taken (for now). 
Enable CALLNAME and add test case for it so we can call global functions. 
Don't clear out arguments, clear out variables at method entry. 
Cleanup trace abort handling. 
Add setprop and tests for setprop and cleanup labling code for debug mode (m=gal). 
Don't allocate FpRegs if sse2 is enabled. 
Label globals and locals with their source-names in trace.
Show line number on abort. 
Disable trees for the time being. 
Better diagnostic info for trace abort. 
Abort trace is STOP is leaving the recording context. 
First stab at incops, plus unbox_jsval tag-masking guard fixes, plus misc. cleanup. 
Remove excess parameters of verifyTypeStability. 
merge (still not working, probably box/unbox dumbness) 
When addressing locations above the stack water level, use ->sp as base. Shaver accidently changed this to ->spbase when merging Igor's patch, so we were writing past the water mark and the stores were killed. 
The VP engineering broke JSOP_NAME! We have to check whether the slot is actually interned and otherwise abort. 
Smarter speculative demotion of numbers to integers and promotion of the trace seems to require actual doubles. If the number at entry looks like an int we make the slot an int and compile as such. If the loop-tail proves the slot to be a double, we recompile the trace. Currently such miss-speculation cannot be handled on secondary traces since we are currently unable to recompile the primary trace. Such secondary traces are blacklisted. 
If we see a f2i(UnboxDouble) chain, simplify it to UnboxInt32 which does the conversion internally. This also enables a fastpath to read 31-bit jsval integers from arrays. 
do setelem in a builtin, so we don't abort trace every 8 times when growing 
Don't use ABORT_TRACE outside the recorder. 
Abort trace if we inline too deeply. 
* Support traceable natives which require cx and this.
* Support fallible traceable natives.
Remove global frame transition code. Obsoleted by the new on-demand global loading code which we are about to add. 
Handle failure signals of < 0 or NULL from traceable natives. 
Use isGlobal to distinguish whether a value is a global slot instead of scanning the table every time. 
If trees are not enabled, don't try to reuse state and param1. 
Add || and && tests; use newlines to join pass and fail results now that there are too many tests to be readable joined by commas on one line. 
- Use JSStackFrame* fp over, don't declare another JSStackFrame* f, in the FORALL macros and clones (f is canonical variable name for nanojit::Fragment*, fp for JSStackFrame*).
- Nit-pick include order (alphabetical within each group).
Comment or/and test framework not being traceable. 
Pull recompile flag out of the state and pass in as argument. Trash the tree if a secondary trace can't be connected to the loop header. This is very aggressive and might need more tinkering. Trashing the tree on every mismatch doesn't seem to work well, so thats currently disabled. 
Always trashing the tree on a type mismatch can't work since the first iteration comes in as undefined for loop-outputs and then kills the main tree that deals with the proper stable types. Have to find a different way to deal with this. 
Disable outerlining, to be replaced with nesting. 
Replace bogus assertion with runtime test for correct abort test (getter or setter, given sprop hit from propcache). 
Use an oracle to predict when slots are demotable. This allows trashing the TreeInfo* object in the root fragment more aggressively. Rebuild the stack type map at every compile to avert type map mismatches. Purge all global slot info when we re-record a tree. 
Remove type-map hash code. A direct memcmp seems to be faster (probably some SSE magic behind it in gcc/glibc). 
Hand the script in when updating the oracle regarding global variable slots even if we don't use it right now. This will be useful for caching information across runtimes. 
Add very preliminary nesting for trees. This is disabled by default. To enable set TRACEMONKEY=nesting in the environment. 
Guard against shapeless callees, with tests (more to do here, can't break the unknown callee case yet, but it should be breakable). 
Prettier spacing knownNatives table. 
Fix obj2 typo, meant obj (obvious use-before-set, sorry about that). 
Match native map guard specializations in tracer to interpreter, particularly to skip up the proto chain from a dense array in JSOP_CALLPROP (json2.js showed an abort here, pointing to the tracer/interpreter discrepancy). 
Object.prototype.{hasOwnProperty,propertyIsEnumerable}. 
Comments for JSOP_{,STRICT}{EQ,NE} about the layering and constraints on evolution of the non-strict equality ops' recorders. 
Fix some comments and tighten up assertions about block scope (mrbkap please look). 
Don't read type from typemap if we already have it in a local variable. 
add way to explicitly disable tracer for easier testing 
Fixed nanojit using a variable before it got set (verbosity mode only it seems). 
- Add String match and three replace overloadings, and allow known native matching to continue in search of exact match (not best, and not abort on first mismatch).
Fix from brendan for propertyIsEnumerable having an inconsistent return type. 
Print relative stack instead of absolute stack address upon side exit (debug mode). 
Abort recording if unwinding from js_Interpret to js_Invoke and still recording (this can happen via fun.call/.apply). Also assert in threaded interpreter BEGIN_CASE and DO_OP (from END_CASE) that we either have no recorder or are using the recordingJumpTable. 
Write back outer tree frames, but exclude the current frame (which the next tree will do). This still crashes the trace-tests.js test case with nesting enabled and for the life of me I can't figure out why (try with TRACEMONKEY=nesting). 
Assert on the recording table only if we have enabled the tracer (446551). 
Fixed recorder not aborting when leaving js_Execute (bug 450532). 
Consolidate tracing-out-of-js_Interpret abort code at bottom of js_Interpret. 
Enable nested trees by default. This is going to be exciting. 
If we extend a tree along a side exit that knew about fewer global slots that we have now in the tree, merge in the types for those additional slots from the entry map (450535). 
Only capture the shape of the global object in a tree once that tree tries to access a global, and only check the stored global shape in trees against the current global shape if the tree actually uses globals (which also doesn't trash trees when global variables are added if that tree doesn't actually use globals.) This is approx. a 1% win for sunspider. 
Try to execute the tree first, and if that fails worry about counting and triggering compilation. This speeds up trace activiation by a tiny bit, but makes code that we can't trace a little bit slower. We use a micro optimization to bypass the call to js_ExecuteTree when its clear that it wouldn't find a tree to executed to reduce this overhead. This change is necessary for multiple trees per bytecode location. 
Disabled 64-bit JIT for now, failing 3 test cases. 
Intern globals per-context, not per tree, which allows transitioning between trees that use globals. The type of all global slots compiled code uses is expected to remain stable, otherwise the entire code cache has to be flushed. Changes to the shape of the global object also flush the code cache. Working for trace-tests.js, but fails math-partial-sum.js 
Don't build trees inside tree calls if no suitable tree can be found (for now.) 
Always blacklist the first fragment in the peer list, and blacklist if we see a loop that is not type-stable. 
Back out multi-trees. There is absolutely no way this will be debugged in time for tomorrow. Need a bit more gdb man-power. 
Another portability fix.  math-spectral-norm is crashing in the test harness so keeping 64-bit JIT off (everything else works). 
Don't disable property caching in eval (this requires GC'ing eval scripts). Do tolerate active Call object at head of scope chain in record_JSOP_CALLNAME, and go straight to the stack slots. 
disable vprof building so that we can build on XP 
If at loop entry we expect a double, but at the loop tail we store an int because we suck the i2f into the side exit, we have to explicitly cast back up to double using i2f otherwise we won't be able to make sense of the value when we load it at the top of the next iteration. 
Add a switch to disable the oracle, in which case we never demote any slots. 
4. Add ABORT_TRACE to LeaveFrame for clarity. 
Fixed code generation bug in AMD64 port.  Enabled AMD64 JIT now. 
disable tracing with active call object pending perf fix 
Abort recording when an error occurs. 
Fix warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Enable outlining. If a loop doesn't connect back to its own header (i.e. break inside the loop), see if the outer loop path can be attached to the inner loop (outerlining). Added test case (failure mode is high number of activated traces in trace-test.js). This test exposes a regression in access-fannkuch. Committing so we can diagnose that separately. 
Generate an always taken LOOP_EXIT guard when an inner loop encounters a break statement. When returning from such an inner tree, make sure the recorder resumes at the target address of the goto the break was emitted as, otherwise the outer tree confuses the location with a break in its own loop. Disabled outerlining (this patch subsumes it, but we might enable it later since it might handle some cases more efficiently, currently off for debugging through). fasta currently asserts, and fannkuch hits a perf regression. These are probably bugs this change exposed. 
Abort recording on JSOP_INCPROP with an invalid slot (bug 452336, r=brendan).

Abort recording on invalid string indexes for JSOP_GETELEM (bug 452713, r=brendan). 
Abort (deeply) if we re-enter js_Interpret in the middle of a trace. r=brendan 
5. js_MakeArraySlow now preserves the pre-slow length in JSSLOT_ARRAY_COUTN as a jsval-tagged int if possible -- this will help the tracer avoid aborting on dense arrays that turned slow but not sparse by addition of a named property.
8. Fix TraceRecorder::test_property_cache to avoid aborting on JSOP_SETNAME that creates a new global, by setting it to undefined so it can be lazily imported. This helps 3d-raytrace.js, which has an unintended global loop control variable in a function.
9. JSTraceableNative loses its premature-deadwood tclasp member (my bad).
11. Add KNOWN_NATIVE_DECL macro for concise prototype of library-private js_* native functions, and alphabetized the lists (too long for any other order to be winning).
Introduce js_DeepAbort to be used from jsinterp.cpp, instead of trying to call TraceRecorder->deepAbort directly (453235). 
New attempt at fixing 453235. If building without JIT (like PPC/MacOSX), don't include the deep abort calls in jsinterp.cpp

Implement browser streams (NPStream from the plugin host to the plugin). Unfortunately, there aren't any tests for this stuff at all.

mac builds and runs with --enable-ipc, but the subprocess nsAppShell dies for an apparently Cocoa-related reason. IPC is fine though 
The test plugin over-retains its scriptable object: NPN_CreateObject returns a retained object, so there's no need to retain it again. This shouldn't fix the leak but it does expose the bug bent just fixed.

Bug 426082, part 3: Reflect a label's :hover/:active state on its associated natively themed control.
This patch adds an aFollowLabels argument to nsIEventStateManager::GetContentState which defaults to false. Setting it to true will return NS_EVENT_STATE_HOVER / _ACTIVE for labeled controls even if only their label is subject to this state. At the moment this flag is only set by native theming, so there won't be an observable change for the :hover / :active pseudoclasses.
In order to make dynamic state changes on the label work, SetContentState will now always notify the labeled control of state changes when its label changes state.

Add code to disable any auth prompt and turn them into failures (from the microsummary svc).
better log viewer performance thanks to chris; small bugfixes in the component; temporarily disable some very verbose logging output 
logging fixes + make verbose logs more readable; fix guid rename commands when applying to objects; make stealLock work even when the resource isn't locked; remove extra tmp logging 
listen to sync.enabled pref and enable/disable auto sync 
sorry about the tabs!  lots of refactoring of the UI bits

clean up prefs; add logging prefs; check weave is enabled on scheduled sync

don't sync bookmarks/history unless they have been enabled 
* Async generators are now allowed to 'bottom out' (StopIteration is ignored) - this is configurable.
  Ability to tweak log levels of individual loggers via prefs.
status label now has service status instead of username; service [un]lock observer notifications are gone; don't error when async methods don't call done() - consider them methods with no return value; don't require passing null into login() to cause the identity to look up the password in the pw mgr; make some wrapper 'method generators' to make lock handling and observer notification simpler 
My changes to weave to enable cookie synchronization.  So far untested and still missing a thing or two. 
Fixed a couple of missing symbol exports that were stopping CookieEngine from being able to be instantiated. 
Fixed bugs in cookieSyncCore.itemExists and cookieStore.addCommand.  The problem in addCommand was just a missing argument, but in itemExists I had to change the implementation to use cookieManager.enumerator rather than cookieManager.findMatchingCookie -- the latter function apparently does not exist in the nsICookieManager2 interface despite what MDC says about it. 
engines now get the pbe identity directly from the identity manager; engines now know their 'enabled' status (pref); main service syncs *all* registered (enabled) engines 
Made xmppClient, transportLayer, and authenticationLayer into proper modules using Components.Utils.  Also renamed the JabberClient class to XMPPClient, which is more accurate (as it implements XMPP which is a newer protocol than Jabber.) 
Made a very simple unit test for xmppClient; it's passing, but currently it connects to the hard-coded URL of a jabber server running on localhost; I'll need to change this if other people are going to be able to run this test. 
temporarily disable xmpp unit test 
I should note that I think that there's a more idiomatic way of doing what I did, but I don't yet fully understand how Weave does things asynchronously.  As such, this commit can probably be refactored to be more in the style of the surrounding code. 
bug 434817: sync tabs 
remove unused _json property from TabSyncCore 
Moved all tab-syncing code to modules/engines/tabsjs. 
create objects for the various server resources (these will later abstract away the actual resources); fix a bug where we were reversing the order of resource filters on every GET request 
Re-disabled test_xmpp_simple.js; it shouldn't be run without a local jabber server (and it wasn't, until I accidentally comitted my local change enabling the test. 
- this check in will break everyone temporarily, as it involves the changes necessary to shift us from sha1(email) to usernames, and to enable sharing on the server.
- we are also changing the default preferences on the trunk to point to the new staging server at https://sm-labs01.mozilla.org:81 that has been modified to support usernames
- Adding temporary button to load account creation form for sm-labs01 while work continues on the first run process.
Just added a few semicolons that js2-mode warned me about. 
give Engine a public getter for its snapshot that TabTracker can access when generating a sync urgency score 
* When wiping the server (due to a server version mismatch), skip .htaccess files, since they are usually not user-modifiable. 
Automated merge with ssh://hg.mozilla.org/labs/weave/ 
Added test_async_missing_yield.  It's very messy right now and duplicates code from other tests, but I've got some ideas about how to write better tests for async ops that I'll commit soon. 
async.js now keeps track of how many outstanding callbacks it has and uses this information to log warnings about coroutines that may have yielded without an outstanding callback, and coroutines that may have finished while a callback is still outstanding.  These are merely 'warnings' rather than certainties because this code assumes that there is a 1:1 correspondence between accesses to self.cb and yields, and also that self.cb's are actually passed to asynchronous functions.  It'd be really cool if we could actually keep track of whether a callback got garbage collected before it was called or something, though I don't know how much it'd help in the end. 
don't sync tab entry IDs, which change with every session, to avoid generating edit commands for every tab on restart even when the tabs haven't actually changed 
Automated merge with ssh://hg.mozilla.org/labs/weave/ 
only retrieve score once per engine when doing a scheduled sync, since retrieving the score can be a non-negligible cost for trackers that calculate the score on-demand (like the tab tracker) 
Fixed my code so that BookmarkEngine._sync() now works correctly to call Engine._sync() and BookmarkEngine.syncMounts(), asynchronously.  Added in some TODO comments about what's going to happen in the next round of refactoring. 
Fixed a couple of minor bugs that were preventing bookmark share from starting (like, i was skipping enabled engines instead of disabled engines... duhh) 
Made the initialization of the xmppClient an asynchronous call.  This included modifying xmppClient.js so that connect() can be passed a callback function that will get called once the connection has succeeded or failed.  For most of our purposes this is probably a better API than what we had before where you call waitForConnection() and it busy-waits until the connection has succeeded or failed. 
Make some 'debug' log calls into 'trace' ones.  Use the frame formatter, which will remove long paths to extension dirs from the output.  Don't warn about outstanding callbacks if we caught an exception from the generator. 
treat paths beginning with '/' as absolute 
Fixed a minor typo, though there's a better way to do the unary getter which Myk told me about; will probably substitute that soon. 
Imported Log4Moz to xmpp/transportLayer.js and xmpp/authenticationLayer.js, so they're no longer raising errors about Log4Moz being undefined (oops, sorry, should have tested before pushing.)

Automated merge with ssh://memerson@mozilla.com@hg.mozilla.org/labs/weave 
Refactored test_passwords to make it more modular and readable, changed the formatting of some log messages to be more descriptive. 
The XMPP server is now configured to use LDAP for authentication (on sm-labs01, and soon to be on services.mozilla too) so the xmpp username/password will now be the same as the weave username/password.  So I now use those to login, and I got rid of the two extra preferences which we used to have for xmpp username/password. 
Removed a line of code that was raising a strict warning, and which also just defined an unused local variable that called no functions and therefore had no side effects (unless there were property getters that had side-effects involved, which hopefully wasn't the case).

Factored the sending of xmpp notifications in bookmarkSharingManager out into a separate function, to save some duplicated code and make it easier to break xmpp stuff into a separate class later.  Also made the bookmarkSharingManager cache the current weave username, which it uses a lot.  Finally it now prepends /user/this._myUsername/ to server URLs to make them into absolute paths before sending them to the sharing partner over xmpp, which fixes a leftover TODO from a copule days ago. 
A new preference called "waitOnQuit.enabled" was created. This preference controls whether Weave will perform any actions on quit. If false, Weave won't perform any actions on quit, nor wait for any running actions. If true, Weave will wait for any running sync to finish.
The old "syncOnQuit.enabled" preference now controls if Weave will actually perform a full sync on quit or not. If false, no sync is started, but we still wait for an active sync to finish, if waitOnQuit.enable is true.
remove 'waitOnQuit.enabled' pref, always wait for a running sync before quitting 
* added ability to cancel a modal sync request, including on application exit. when cancel is clicked on by the user, it will attempt to cancel the sync at the next opportunity (i.e. before the next sync engine is processed)

updates to resource class, use a new Auth service with pluggable 'authenticator' objects 
enable batch upload, yay! 
Added Linux-ARM processor compiled version of crypto module to repository.  Slight modification of makefile to enable building this on ARM. 
disable tracker for entire sync run.  make sure tracker is re-enabled at the end 
oops, always disable tracker during sync 
re-enable tracker in the first-sync case just to add all the guids; add some debugging messages; when reconciling throw out records which are identical on the client and server (even if we thought they had changed) 
clear changed IDs before adding all current ones in first-sync case; edit the ID list directly instead of enabling/disabling the tracker 
more/better logging; allow changed IDs list to be cleared even when tracker is disabled 
remove sync cores, they are no longer used; remove sharing code from bookmarks (we can bring it back when we need it again, needs work); have the engine give hints to the store about when to wrap all items and cache them (to make subsequent calls to wrap one item fast); move serializeItem/getAllIDs into the store 
enable history sync (not working yet) 
change itemExists to check for the cache, then call _itemExists, that way subclasses can override just that without having to care about the cache 
fix some variable references to use a local var instead of a closure 
* Streamline sync to be able to process incoming records one at a time, as soon as they are downloaded.  This changes reconciliation to be able to process a single incoming record.
switch to generating individual bookmark records directly from the places store, without using a cache (to improve memory performance); create objects for bookmark types; temporarily disable history sync 
update history engine to work again with latest engine changes, and re-enable history sync 
partially re-enable client data (guid,name,type) 
The Weave check box on the Fennec preferences screen now logs you in/out when you click it in addition to enabling/disabling the scheduler.  Improved the fennec-connect page by making the text fields auto-select when you click in them and turning the 'accept TOS' check box into a button. 
History sync now works in Fennec, by simply skipping all the temp tables that don't exist in Fennec.  This should also fix bug 472853 for weave in Firefox. 
ignore/unignore specific weave IDs instead of a blanket enable/disable of the tracker during sync. 
disable unused engines; fix trackers trying to call enable which is gone now; improve bookmarks tracker logging 
Made the label inside the Weave pref on the main Fennec preferences screen into a dynamic status indicator 
Added a method to historyStore called tempTableExists which does a SELECT (rather than using tableExists) to correctly tell whether a temp table is there or not, so that historyEngine will work correctly on both Fennec and Firefox (See bug 472963) 
disable scheduled sync when login fails 
Rewrote tabs engine to work with 0.3 API.  (Not yet tested). 
Added debugging info to TabEngine.  Instantiated and registered TabEngine in both Firefox weave glue and Fennec weave glue. 
Switched TabTracker to register listeners on window open and remove them at window close -- need to find an alternate way to make this work on Fennec, where windows don't have tabContainers. 
Fixed some minor problems with TabEngine; identified places where TabEngine will need to use alternate methods to work on Fennec. 
SessionStore not available on Fennec, so now using alternate methods to get the list of tabs. 
remove unused code; add multi-cluster support; use Svc.Prefs branch for prefs; move some code from the window overlay into onStartup (print weave version and user agent string); automatically disable weave if crypto module is not working 
Fennec tabs and Firefox tabs now handled in different functions, and the Fennec one at least works. 
Fixed tab encoding bug on Fennec 
Fixed bug in tab encoding in Firefox. 
add missing setter for the weave enabled pref

Tab sync works, and has UI in firefox (though not yet in Fennec) 
First pass at Fennec tab UI. There's now a button that opens a fullscren panel from the left, which contains the names of all remote tabs.  They're not clickable yet. 
Fixed a bug in how Firefox gets URL history to save when syncing tabs up.  Also some more work on the Fennec tabs UI. 
Tab sync now skips empty tabs.  This fixes bug 479216. 
Bug 479232: don't wipe tabs engine when it hasn't loaded

disable recordLike for clients 
Added a mostRecentError field to Weave.Service, which gets set to a string on any error that the user might need to know about; this is queried by the Fennec UI code to disply better error messages. 
Bug 481345 - Weave should be disabled while offline or private browsing mode is active. r=thunder 
Fixed tabs in services.js. 
The remote-tabs menu (on both firefox and fennec) no longer shows tabs you already have open locally.  Fixes bug 480405. 
Fennec remote-tab browser now has buttons to sort by date, name, or source client.  This mostly fixes bug 481326, but I need to add more metadata to tab records before I can make sort-by-date work. 
If you click the button to show synced tabs before Weave has been configured, it will now take you straight to the sign-in screen.  Fixes bug 482818. 
TabTracker now keeps track of when each tab was most recently used; tabStore wraps this data for sync, and fennec UI uses it to sort incoming tabs by most-recently-used date.  This fixes 481326. 
Removed unused code from tab tracker. 
Experimenting with getting tab last-used-time data on Fennec 
Never wipe the server if key generation is disabled; in case of version mismatch, describe the error and abort.  This fixes 482062. 
Made sure that tabs with undefined title or undefined last used date can't break sort ordering.  See bug 481326. 
De-uglified visuals of the sort-by date/title/client buttons in Fennec remote-tab view.  See bug 481326. 
Bug 481319: Weave.Service can now be queried for top-level status (OK, failed, partial success), and also for an object that gives detailed status (what caused sync to abort, server status codes, status of each engine, etc.) 
Fixed name of TabStore.changeItemID so that it correctly overrides the abstract base class method.  Whoops. 
make dialogs non-resizable, split lazy callbacks out 
Bug 485539 - added guard to the tab engine to handle the case where there are undefined items in tabContainer.childNodes. 
remove dump() debugging from tabs engine 
Initialize unified client store from disk json and local prefs and update on pref changes + sync. Clean up client engine code (local vs inherited, alphabetical), and create a helper modify() to save snapshots. 
Just relabel Cancel to Hide (but keep around the original (localized) label in case we fail) 
Expose a .deleted property that engines can set to true to store an even thinner deleted payload (empty string "" instead of "[null]") on the server. Handle deserializing of deleted records by setting the property. Note: Engines must set their payloads to something JSON-able if it's not a delete record. 
switch from --utc to -u flag to enable UTC output for date command so it works on both Linux/Windows (which support --utc in addition to -u) and Mac OS X (which only supports -u) 
Bug 488182 - Use an Iterator to grab both key and values from cleartext for processing bookmarks
Add seamonkey bits for manifest/install. Start with Form, History, Password engines.. No places bookmarks and tabs seem to have issues applying(?) 
Added an openID munger.  Turn on the pref extensions.weave.openId.enabled and then load any page with an OpenID login form; Weave alters the form and prefills a URI for a Weave-provided openID. 
disable the authenticator unless it is enabled via the authenticator.enabled pref 
Min version is 3.1/5, so we grab DBConnection from places directly now. 
Remove existing hardcoded engine list + prefs and build checkboxes based on registered engines. Engines that give null for enabled (instead of true/false) are considered disabled. Update base Engine enabled get/set to give null and allow setting. 
Bug 493002 - List partially implemented engines (cookies, input history) as disabled

Bug 506268 - Session restore fails halfway through, leaves tabs unloaded
Bug 513944 - Weave should not load / do anything until it absolutely needs to
Weave already triggers on a late notification and puts itself on the event loop, so just additionally delay startup based on the number of open tabs (which will all be busy at startup). 
Add initial error reporting and "available" tagging. Also add "start over" functionality and change some custom settings display. 
Bug 518864 - Persist "next sync time" across events that disable sync
Adjust how often Weave syncs based on the number of clients and only sync tabs if there are multiple clients. 
Bug 518958 - Only sync tabs if there has been tab activity
Check the score, which gets bumped up on tab open/close/select, to decide if tabs should be marked as changed. 
Don't try logging out when already logged out -- about:weave calls logout which tries to _log, but Fennec weave hasn't loaded Weave yet. 
Simplify logic for Engines.getAll/Enabled and use Enabled for main sync loop.

Bug 535477 - Always sync tabs but inform Fennec users that recent tabs need syncing
Remove special casing of tabs prefs and remove tabs.backup to simplify the UI logic. Also remove dynamically enabling/disabling based on number of clients. For Fennec, show a notification about recent tabs need syncing. 
Bug 535479 - Be smarter in getting rid of the "remote tabs" notification
Add a tri-state pref that is unset, 0, or a number (modified time in seconds) and don't show the notification if it's in the "0" state. Unset pref means no modified time has been saved, and a non-0 state is the modified time of the last synced tab. So when tabs arrive with a different modified time, switch to the 0 state. Additionally, still remember if the user ever dismissed the notification and never show it again.

Localized a string in fx-prefs.xul as confirm.client.moreinfo.label. 
Get rid of get/setInfo on ClientEngine and ClientStore and expose functions to read/modify client data: stats, clearCommands, sendCommand. Also expose the local client information as local[ID,Name,Type,Commands] and rework the storage to use these instead of trying to keep the JS object clients entry in sync with prefs, etc. Update users of the old interface (service/tabs/chrome) to use the new local*. Set the client type based on app id instead of from each app's overlay. 
Bug 555015 - JavaScript strict warning: bookmarks.js: undeclared variable record [r=Mardak]
Just make sure the record variable is declared before using it. 
Bug 550267 - Sync tabs before other data for Fennec [r=mconnor]
Move tabs to be first instead of last to sync for fennec. 
bug 508112 - captcha will not work with noscript enabled, r=Mardak 
bug 539056 - Better Tab sync UI and discoverability, r=Mardak 
Bug 535326 - Need to rethink tab sync limit of 25 [r=mconnor]
Fit as many tabs as possible in 20000 characters by linearly estimating how many will fit then remove extras one by one. 
Get rid of STATUS_DELAYED and initialize Weave listeners, etc immediately. At the end of onStartup, wait a little bit to let sessionstore restore tabs and then count how many busy tabs to delay autoconnecting to avoid doing network while tabs are doing network. 
Start an abortTimer onStartRequest and refresh the timer on each onDataAvailable only to cancel on an onStopRequest. If the timer triggers, the sync/async call will be aborted. 
Write a FormWrapper that knows about GUIDs and get/sets them in moz_formhistory as needed. It lazily adds the columns on failure and lazily generates GUIDs for entries that are missing it. Don't eagerly create a sha1 formItem mapping -- don't create it at all, so empty syncs will be much faster too. 
Replace tabs in files under source/ with appropriate number of spaces. 
Bug 557623 - Tab sync broken on fennec since session-store was added [r=zpao]
Also removed the pref usage, so that resetting is properly cancelable (by pressing cancel, closing the window, or quitting). 
Check remoteSetup first to determine if we're okay to sync before wiping client/remote. Additionally only wipe enabled engines instead of everything. 
Delay the abort timer from the constructor in addition to onStartRequest and onDataAvailable in-case the callbacks never get called. 
Bug 553402 - New pages in a tab aren't synced [r=mconnor]
Trace pageshow events to indicate that new tab data should be uploaded. Because scores must be integers, still increment the score by 1, but only do that 10% of the time for pageshows. 
Bug 561005 - Use FakeSvc to grab binary crypto if js-ctypes doesn't work [r=zpao r=mconnor]
Bug 562159 - Tabs from other computers don't show at about:weave-tabs, r=Mardak 
Bug 556454 - engine.sync should always check engine.enabled [r=mconnor]
Just check if the engine is enabled at the beginning of sync. For now keep getEnabled as it's used for other behavior and not just sync. 
Only register WeaveCrypto if it was able to import scripts. 
Always sync client data by making sure it's always enabled and only update local cilent with remote commands. Make sure to sync clients to get a list of clients that need to receive commands. Also, make sure to upload data after wiping remote now that remoteSetup happens before wipeRemote. 
Bug 563868 - Provide better feedback when server is unreachable or doesn't have a server instance during setup.  also fixes bug 564329.  r=Mardak 
Hide the item by default and show only for the dev channel. Also only show the separator and time if there's a time. Register about:weave-log to access the activity log. 
Bug 564533 - Register about: pages as sync instead of weave [r=mconnor]
Switch the component and uses in the UI to about:sync-*. 
Bug 568256 - form history changes breaks form sync, FF search bar, probably more [r=mconnor]
Bug 569740 - Tab Characters within Usernames Can Cause Connectivity Issues & Security Events [r=mconnor]
Strip tabs from username since tabs are stripped from URIs and the username is part of all URIs. 
Weave.Service.onStartup now triggers autoconnect after a fixed delay specified in a preference. If that preference is absent, nothing happens and apps are responsible for triggering autoconnect in a weave:service:ready observer themselves. Provide such observers for Firefox and Fennec. 
* Get rid of unused DEFAULT_SERVER variable
* Hardcode STORAGE_VERSION. The three other variable substitutions are add-on specific. 
Bug 573194 - AboutWeaveTabs still references chrome://weave/content/firefox/tabs.xul [r=Mardak]

Move about:weave-tabs component to ui/firefox and flatten structure of the components. Split prefs for services vs firefox. 
Get a profile for xpcshell tests so that login manager works (and probably other stuff). Fix up anno test from this change to use a real bookmark id.

Bug 568691 part A - register static and binary components using data tables rather than programmatic nsIComponentRegistrar methods. This part contains the important needs-review bits of the change: part B contains the mechanical changes to each module in order to actually get a working build. Part C will contain changes necessary to register JS components from .manifest files 
This patch has some bugs, specifically we stop looking for .manifest files in chrome/. I will fix that in a followup. It also probably breaks non-libxul builds because of ordering issues.
Fix non-debug bustage in nsNativeComponentLoader, this variable should not be debug-only. 
Fix --disable-crashreporter build in nsAppRunner.cpp 
Bug 568691 - Register extension components/chrome again. This doesn't remove the EM restart yet, because there's some weirdness about reading default prefs from extensions that needs to be solved first. 
Remove hard tabs which I accidentally introduced into nsComponentManager.{h,cpp}. 
Revert many of the interface changes from bug 568691, so that binaries can be made which are compatible with Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 4. Note that this is not an ongoing process: it will not be possible to make single binary components which are compatible with both Firefox 4 and Firefox 4.1, but you will be able to ship two components and select one based on the platform version. 
Bug 568691 followup - Clear the static module table at shutdown to fix leaks. 
Fix the nsBrowserGlue registration to be available even in non-Firefox, because there are places xpcshell tests which require it and don't forge the app ID. 
Bug 568691 - Add an ABI chrome registration modifier so that platform-specific directories can be implemented directly in chrome.manifest. 
Disable the xpt-in-JAR test because that code is changing and running the test with a .manifest isn't worth it. 
Fix generic classinfo objects so that they are allocated statically, to avoid leak-detector annoyances, but not initialized statically, because compilers are stupid and won't const-data-initialize an object with a vtable, even if they could.

+ Fixed "new tabs create 2 thumbnails" bug 
+ the top level index.html now automatically grabs all the different visualizations and lists them
+ Added a tab() feature to window.Tabs, to get a tab object from one of the tab's elements
+ Utils.error() now identifies the error as coming from tabcandy
+ Added a heartbeat to TabMirror, where all painting happens now. This allows us to control when and how frequently painting happens, throttling when there are a lot of items on the screen.
+ Additional clean-up in TabMirror 
+ New tabs in the stacks candy now find an empty hole rather than piling up at the top
+ The stacks candy now has a "site" feature (upper right) that groups the tabs by domain
+ TabMirror now has a feature to allow pausing paint updates. This allows you to fly things around the screen without getting stutter from paint calls. The stacks candy is currently the only candy that takes advantage of this.
+ It's no longer possible to accidentally launch into a tab by dragging the mouse and ending up on a tab. Same for close boxes
+ It's no longer possible to add a tab to a group twice (by dragging it around inside the group)
+ When a tab inside a group is closed, it's removed from the group. If it's the last in the group, the group goes away
+ Removed the margin from the tabs; we need to handle buffers more explicitly
+ You can no longer launch into a tab by right clicking it
+ some steps toward having groups and tabs share an interface
+ First working draft of tabs and groups getting pushed out of the way by the creation of a new group
+ The grid feature now removes all the tabs from their groups beforehand; it doesn't restore tab sizes properly yet
+ You can now rearrange tabs inside a group
+ font size for tab names now scales properly
+ tabs now return to their proper size when you pull them out of a group
+ further unified dragging tabs vs dragging groups
+ Further unified the Group and TabItem objects under Item 
+ Fixed bug causing the closing of unrelated tabs to destroy groups 
+ Now pointing to the doc folder from the Tab Candy home page
+ The Tab Candy home page is now accessible from the Candy drop-down 
+ Removed unnecessary margin and padding from tabs and groups (was messing up layout)
+ Now compensating for padding in tabs when laying them out
+ Tab titles are now a single line, cut at the width of the tab (but no ellipsis yet)
+ Tab resizing now works, and is disabled when a tab is in a group
+ We now have a "new tabs" group that new tabs go into (created as needed)
+ New layout algorithm for tabs inside a group. It's not as space efficient as the last one, but the unused space is at the bottom rather than the right side, and in general I think it behaves more like people expect.
+ If you drag the second to last tab out of a group and don't return it to that group, the group now dissolves.
+ When a tab gets below a certain size, its thumbnail and close box are hidden
+ When a tab's title gets below a certain size, it is hidden. 
+ The tab bar toggle now has a down arrow when clicking on it will pull the tab bar down and an up arrow when it will push the tab bar up (was reversed)
+ The tab bar toggle and decorative strip now reside above the tab candy content in Z
+ Fixed the dev mode features (were broken by the tab bar toggle changes)
+ The Firefox nav bar now correctly shows again when you create and go to a new tab 
+ The "new tab" group no longer gets pushed away by the other items
+ Started work on Squish!™ code, not ready yet, so disabled 
+ Disabled autoscroll on drag; the window should be locked down now
+ Fixed Aza's "cute little bug"; small tabs used to scoot up and left 
+ Now saving and reconstituting tabs
+ Fixed start up problem when there's only one tab 
+ Added the close box back to the "new tab" group; it doesn't close the group, but it closes all the tabs. Seems like a useful feature, though maybe it shouldn't look like all the other close boxes
+ Fixed bug with dragging tabs out of a group
+ Resizing the window now works, even if you've closed tab candy
+ When unsquishing, groups aren't forced into tab aspect ratio 
+ Fixed a bug making it so you couldn't close tabs that were just .mov
+ Made tabs prettier when stacked
+ Made it so the "new tabs" group is no longer locked (for the time being at least)
+ Tabs no longer change order when you drag their groups around
+ You now have to drag at least 100 pixels and at least 500 milliseconds before a tab is pulled out its tray
+ No longer reserving space at the bottom of the screen for the "new tabs" group
+ Tab titles now go away when stacked and come back when not (there was a problem with them coming back)
+ No longer explicitly positioning the "new tabs" group 
+ We use to show tabcandy whenever we closed any tab. We now only focus tabcandy when the last tab in a group is closed.
+ TODO: Ideally, we should have an animation of the last tab be zoomed out into the tabcandy interface, and then that tab fading away along with the group (if the group is unnamed). 
+ Tabs dropped on stacks now appear on top
+ We now show chrome tabs (but not the tab candy tab)
+ When the browser first starts up, it takes it a while for the tabs to all get their correct URLs; we now properly deal with this when reconnecting them to their groups
+ You can now click-n-drag in empty space to create a group. If the group is too small, it will animate away (the cancel action) and if they group contains orphaned tabs, lo', it pulls those tabs into itself.
+ Changed the behavior of removing the penultimate tab from a group. The group no longer goes away until the very last tab is removed.
+ The "new tabs" group can now not be renamed or closed, but it can be moved and resized. Updated how item locking works to accommodate this.
+ Groups now have some extra space at the bottom to accommodate for the "new tab" button
+ Fixed a number of issues with pulling tabs out of a tray. Temporarily disabled the delay on drag as well.
+ patch from Dietrich to get Tab Candy running in Minefield (disables listing of candies) 
+ Fixed: Quit Firefox with TabCandy open then open Firefox again. Your tabs and and navbar get hidden.
+ Fixed: If you quit tab candy (but not the browser), all of the tabs need to be reshown.
+ Starting firefox with tab candy selected now hides the tab bar
+ Utils.activeTab now returns a Tabs tab, rather than a raw tab 
+ Feature: When returning from a tab that is in a stack, arrange it at the top of the stack (but don't change its order in the children list)
+ TabItems now keeps track of all TabItem objects manually; we were using $('.tab:visible'), but this was causing bizarre behavior in certain cases 
+ the TabCandy button/hot key now works to make a separate TabCandy for each window
+ Fixed a number of startup issues relating to multiple tab candies running at the same time 
+ New "new tabs" group behavior and position
+ New "new tab" button position for the  "new tabs" group
+ The function you give to TabMirror.customize now takes a Mirror rather than a jQuery object
+ iQ is coming along. I tried to put asserts in for all the standard functionality that's missing (and that we might not need, but that someone used to jQuery might expect). I've also been adding Natural Docs comments, to give a sense of the scope+ Got rid of TabCanvas.animate(), which we haven't used in a while.
+ removed sizzle reference from iQ.js license block, as it doesn't look like we'll be using any portion of jQuery that has sizzle (also, testing my ability to push to mozilla hg) 
+ First use of iQ.animate(), which uses CSS transitions: tab zoom up and down, as well as phantom group disappearing when you drag in empty space but don't make it big enough
+ Started on iQ for tabitems.js; now using iQ for TabItem.setBounds. We're not yet supporting the tabcandy bounce animation, so the tab movement boring now… to be fixed soon.
+ tabitems.js is now jQuery-free except for drag/drop/resize
+ Cleaned up usage of TabItems.getItemByTab and renamed it to getItemByTabElement to make it clearer 
+ groups.js is now jQuery-free except for drag/drop/resize and the newTab routine
+ Temporarily disabled TabMirror.pausePainting, which is causing problems at the moment (will fix soon) 
+ iQ.fn.animate now reliably calls back the completion routine (this was causing all sorts of trouble)
+ Reenabled TabMirror.pausePainting
+ Converted Group.newTab over to iQ (was the last jQuery bit besides drag/drop/resize) 
+ You can drop tabs onto groups (but no tabs on tabs yet)
+ Disabled resize for now
+ You can now drop tabs on tabs
+ Fixed some of the tab sizing issues (like when returning from a tab) 
+ Cleaned up TabItem bounds getting and setting (the translation between our coordinates and the div style needs to be done carefully, in particular due to the padding in the tab style), and added a unit test for it 
+ Fixed: Bug 570089  - Dragging northwest in tabcandy area creates zero-area tab group 
+ In the quest to abolish reloadBounds(), I've rewritten draggable, droppable and resizable to operate on an item's bounds rather than directly on the div. I've also removed those routines from iQ, and integrated them into Item. Additional related cleanup and documentation.
+ If a dragged item overlaps more than one droppable, the largest intersection wins
+ Added "refresh" to the dev menu (since you won't be able to just refresh the tabcandy page once it's in the xul:deck) 
Bug 572889 - Move TabCandy out of a tab and into a per-window xul:deck [r=iangilman]
Update code for tabCandy in xul:deck to not assume it's living in a tab and update various events and callbacks. 
+ Removed TabItems.reconstitute(), which we haven't actually needed for a while, but now it's also causing trouble
+ Removed Utils.activeWindow, which doesn't seem to work, and replaced its use in Utils.activeTab (the only remaining place it was being used) with Utils.getCurrentWindow(), which does seem to work
+ Fixed paths to the edit pencil and new tab button images; they should now show up properly 
bug 577968: removing elses preceded by returns; replacing tabs 
Bug 576110: Open tab candy at startup if it was last open 
+ Subscribable (in utils.js) no longer has a separate onClose path
+ Cleaned up a scope issue with Subscribable and added some guards 
Bug 576110: Show saved thumbnails at browser startup if tab candy was last open 
Bug 577445: Show tab candy title in the tab candy interface and change 'let' to 'var' 
+ Finished documenting all of the app code, plus utils.js. Remaining: iq.js, mirror.js, tabs.js 
Fixed Bug 579814 - Fix behavior of tab-manipulation keyboard shortcuts 
Remove trailing spaces/tabs from tabcandy files. 
Bug 580870 - Alias gBrowser to the tabcandy context to remove getCurrentWindow
Add aliases for gWindow, gBrowser, gTabDeck, gTabFrame for the tabcandy chrome context. Update uses and simplify some code like removing Navbar. 
Bug 581078 - Get rid of Utils.activeTab to avoid iterating over all Tabs
Directly access gBrowser.selectedTab and compare other raw tabs against it until BrowserTab goes away. Get the reference to the BrowserTab instead of iterating over Tabs through .tabcandyBrowserTab. 
+ rewrote TabItem close button opacity and title font size using the new Range utilities. Should make code a tad easier to follow. 
Followup bug 580870 to rename gTabDeck/gTabFrame to gTabView*. 
Move lazy gWindow, gBrowser, etc into tabcandy.js out of utils.js for bug 582023. 
Move utils.js into a javascript module that exports Point, Rect, Range, Subscribable, and Utils for bug 582023. 
Bug 583044 - Rename code references of TabCandy to TabView
Move files and update references to tabview from tabcandy. Only remaining candy reference is the link to aza's webm video. 
+ Improved startup sequence: don't do anything until sessionstore is available, and then do only minimal work if we're not loading directly into the UI; most setup now happens when we first show the UI. Known issue: tabs aren't set up properly in the tab bar until after you go to the UI once.
+ more tabItems cleanup, including removing a stray call to the now non-existent TabCanvas.detach()
+ Made the Groups.killNewTabGroup test a little tighter (in case someone has made a group called "new tabs")
- declaring variables more locally using let in Utils.extend

Fixed a bug whereby the Tabs object was empty if Jetpack wasn't also installed.
Added some presentations about the goals for this project. 
Go to chrome://tabcandy/content/select/index.html to try it out! 
Integrated selections into my tab demo. 
+ Fixed "new tabs create 2 thumbnails" bug 
Fixed the lasso selection for my tab.html page. And added functionality that let you say if the lasso colors in or not. 
+ the top level index.html now automatically grabs all the different visualizations and lists them
+ Added a tab() feature to window.Tabs, to get a tab object from one of the tab's elements
Added a TODO to fix a very strange behavior in the customization of new tabs added. 
Gave all .tab's a z-index which solves some issues with stacking in groups. 
+ Utils.error() now identifies the error as coming from tabcandy
+ Added a heartbeat to TabMirror, where all painting happens now. This allows us to control when and how frequently painting happens, throttling when there are a lot of items on the screen.
+ Additional clean-up in TabMirror 
+ New tabs in the stacks candy now find an empty hole rather than piling up at the top
+ The stacks candy now has a "site" feature (upper right) that groups the tabs by domain
+ TabMirror now has a feature to allow pausing paint updates. This allows you to fly things around the screen without getting stutter from paint calls. The stacks candy is currently the only candy that takes advantage of this.
+ updated the original and ian1 candies so the thumbnail scales automatically with the jquery animation of the whole tab 
* Groups are now resizable!
* Added a stop-gap measure for scaling tabs better. (Ian has a better, automatic solution?)
+ Fixed a bug where dragging a tab within a group and dropping it again would add it  a second time. Related to this bug, found that tabs were being added to the Group._children sometimes as DOM elements and sometimes as jQuery objects. Standardized on DOM objects
+ The Group class is now available from the Groups object, so outside code can create new groups 
We are now part of the way towards getting namable spaces, as well as spaces that close a number of tabs. 
  the page zooms to the foreground before the tab switch happens
  giving the appearance of having the tab zoom to life.
  a tab. 
Added Tabs.onFocus back into tabs.js 
ORIGINAL: Added the reverse zoom animation (for when switching back to tabcandy).
Also, fixed a bug where I didn't remove the "transitionend" event handler which was causing all sorts of strange things (like zooming in on a tab when the search-box was used. 
+ moved a number of the group-related styles into css/shared/groups.css. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to move everything I wanted to; Firefox 3.7 screwed up the relative URL in the resizer style, and somehow killed the position:absolute in close style (neither of those problems showed up in Firefox 3.6). At any rate, it's a step in the right direction.
+ Moved the pretty new group title bar into the original and ian1 candies, updating the close style so it works in both the tab and group contexts
+ Added forceCanvasSize and unforceCanvasSize functions to tab mirrors
+ Reverted from CSS-Transitions to jQuery Animations. There were just too many errors using Firefox 3.7 (like that new tabs stopped appearing, and closed tabs stopped dissapearing!)
+ Added the ability for Groups to assume any shape 
+ It's no longer possible to accidentally launch into a tab by dragging the mouse and ending up on a tab. Same for close boxes
+ It's no longer possible to add a tab to a group twice (by dragging it around inside the group)
+ When a tab inside a group is closed, it's removed from the group. If it's the last in the group, the group goes away
+ Removed the margin from the tabs; we need to handle buffers more explicitly
+ You can no longer launch into a tab by right clicking it
+ some steps toward having groups and tabs share an interface
+ First working draft of tabs and groups getting pushed out of the way by the creation of a new group
+ The grid feature now removes all the tabs from their groups beforehand; it doesn't restore tab sizes properly yet
+ You can now rearrange tabs inside a group
+ Made the resizer graphic URL absolute instead of relative so that it works in any candy.
+ Moved window.TabItem into tabitems.js and added a window.TabItems, which is largely the mod routine pulled from ui.js 
+ Group and TabItem now inherit from Item (currently the pushAway routine and isAnItem property)
+ Groups and tabs now push other items away when they're moved, and groups also do so when resized
+ Improved Tabs.tab() (though it's still kind of a hack); new tabs weren't being hooked up properly 
+ font size for tab names now scales properly
+ tabs now return to their proper size when you pull them out of a group
+ further unified dragging tabs vs dragging groups
+ Further unified the Group and TabItem objects under Item 
+ Reenabled the titlebar
+ Fixed bug causing the closing of unrelated tabs to destroy groups 
+ Now pointing to the doc folder from the Tab Candy home page
+ The Tab Candy home page is now accessible from the Candy drop-down 
+ Tabs now have the correct style inside of groups. 
+ Tabs regain appropriate styling when being removed from a group. 
Now correctly sizes new tabs. 
+ Removed unnecessary margin and padding from tabs and groups (was messing up layout)
+ Now compensating for padding in tabs when laying them out
+ Tab titles are now a single line, cut at the width of the tab (but no ellipsis yet)
+ Tab resizing now works, and is disabled when a tab is in a group
+ We now have a "new tabs" group that new tabs go into (created as needed)
+ New layout algorithm for tabs inside a group. It's not as space efficient as the last one, but the unused space is at the bottom rather than the right side, and in general I think it behaves more like people expect.
+ If you drag the second to last tab out of a group and don't return it to that group, the group now dissolves.
+ When a tab gets below a certain size, its thumbnail and close box are hidden
+ When a tab's title gets below a certain size, it is hidden. 
Added a TabCandy button to the navigation toolbar on startup.
+ Clicking on it opens a tab to Revision-A
  - The tab is moved to being the first tab
  - The tab is visually hidden
  - Clicking on it again re-uses the opened tab
* We should think about loading the page in the background on startup
+ Automatic badging for unread tabs: just set Toolbar.unread += 1 or some such. 
Added the code to show the unread badge in the toolbar on new tab openings and hide the unread count when you visit tabcandy.
+ The badge only gets updated when a tab finished *loading* 
Fixed some performance issues (?!) with the Toolbar. When I added it to tabitems.js it caused the browser to freeze up.
Instead, I added a new event listener for tab openings which updates the badge. This solves two problems at once. 
+ the "new tab" group now always lives at the bottom of the page
+ the Firefox nav bar is now hidden when you're in the tab candy page
+ the starting grid now scales depending on how many tabs you have. (it is in fact sharing the arrange code that groups use for their children) 
Added a beautiful tabbar toggle. Woot! 
+ The tab bar toggle now has a down arrow when clicking on it will pull the tab bar down and an up arrow when it will push the tab bar up (was reversed)
+ The tab bar toggle and decorative strip now reside above the tab candy content in Z
+ Fixed the dev mode features (were broken by the tab bar toggle changes)
+ The Firefox nav bar now correctly shows again when you create and go to a new tab 
+ The "new tab" group no longer gets pushed away by the other items
+ Started work on Squish!™ code, not ready yet, so disabled 
+ Added animation to showing/hiding the tabbar
+ More updates to the TabCandy Spec 
+ We pause tab mirroring/painting on zooms.
+ Items now has a squishMode variable you can set to one of three possible ways to deal with items getting pushed off the screen: resize the whole set, squish only the ones getting pushed off, let them get pushed off but then have them push back on when there's room 
+ started locking down the "new tabs" group
+ finished locking down the "new tabs" group… can no longer be renamed or auto deleted
+ Removed potential slowdown for dragging tabs… should be the same now as it was before my "keeping groups and children in sync" fix 
+ Disabled autoscroll on drag; the window should be locked down now
+ Fixed Aza's "cute little bug"; small tabs used to scoot up and left 
+ We're now storing data in a file named after your candy, in a folder named 'tabcandy' inside your profile folder (e.g. tabcandy/revision-a.json). Currently the only data that's round-tripped is whether you have hidden the tab bar, but we are saving group data out (just not reading it yet).
+ Now saving and reconstituting tabs
+ Fixed start up problem when there's only one tab 
+ Now reconnecting tabs with groups
+ Added the close box back to the "new tab" group; it doesn't close the group, but it closes all the tabs. Seems like a useful feature, though maybe it shouldn't look like all the other close boxes
+ Fixed bug with dragging tabs out of a group
+ Resizing the window now works, even if you've closed tab candy
+ When unsquishing, groups aren't forced into tab aspect ratio 
+ squishing no longer forces groups into tab aspect ratio
+ Cleaned up issues with algorithm for choosing where to position a tab dropped into a group
+ You can no longer drag a tab or group around by its close box
+ Changed tab drop tolerance… tabs now just need to overlap 50% in order to group. This is to make it consistent with dropping a tab on an existing group, which already behaved this way
+ A single tab in a group will no longer fill the entire group 
An experimental idea that makes that tabbar show only items in your current group. 
+ When you open a new tab in an active group, that new tab belongs to the active group.
+ Made the New Tabs area much smaller. 
+ Created a new easing function called "tabcandyBounce" (which will soon be all the rage in the underground dance clubs fo Europe).
+ tabcandyBounce is the kind of easing function that gentle overshoots the ends and then bounces back, giving a human feel.
+ tabcandyBounce feels faster than it actually is :)
+ Fixed a bug making it so you couldn't close tabs that were just .mov
+ Made tabs prettier when stacked
+ Made it so the "new tabs" group is no longer locked (for the time being at least)
+ Tabs no longer change order when you drag their groups around
+ You now have to drag at least 100 pixels and at least 500 milliseconds before a tab is pulled out its tray
+ No longer reserving space at the bottom of the screen for the "new tabs" group
+ Tab titles now go away when stacked and come back when not (there was a problem with them coming back)
+ No longer explicitly positioning the "new tabs" group 
+ We use to show tabcandy whenever we closed any tab. We now only focus tabcandy when the last tab in a group is closed.
+ TODO: Ideally, we should have an animation of the last tab be zoomed out into the tabcandy interface, and then that tab fading away along with the group (if the group is unnamed). 
+ Removed more Toolbar button code (it is no longer needed given that we are showing tabs)
+ The activated group is now set when you open a stacked tray's overlay. This means that new tabs go in the right spot for stacked groups. 
+ Added a first-pass at a new-tab interface for groups.
 + (2) The new tab animation is to the wrong place groups.js:line 96 
+ Tabs dropped on stacks now appear on top
+ We now show chrome tabs (but not the tab candy tab)
+ When the browser first starts up, it takes it a while for the tabs to all get their correct URLs; we now properly deal with this when reconnecting them to their groups
+ Added some code that, when you zoom into a group, moves all of the tabs to the end of the tabstrip (in the order which they appear in the group). This does two things:
 (1) It means that the tabs are shown in the order which they appear in the group. Keeps the mental model clean.
 (2) When you close a tab, the next tab that is focused is sane (i.e., it is in the group not some random tab) 
+ New tab button animation now goes to where the tab is actually going to arrive
+ Giving a little more space at the bottom of groups so tabs overlap the new tab button
+ Fixed issue with tab reconnection on startup 
+ Added reverse-syncing of tab ordering: from tab bar order to group order.
 - Before this commit, changing the order of tabs in a group would change
   the order of tabs in the tab bar on zoom-in.
   change the order of tabs in the tab bar, those changes will be reflected
   in the order of tabs in the group. 
+ Grappling with a correct new-tab animation 
+ fixed aza's heisenbug having to do with creating new tabs 
+ Improved minimal size for groups and tabs inside of groups
+ If you have two tabs with the same url in different groups, and you refresh, it now does the right thing (unless that url is about:blank, in which case it drops them in the "new tabs" group)
+ Adds an new-tab animation that Feels Right(tm) [although the timing might still need tweaking]
+ When new tabs are added while TabCandy is focused, the no longer animate in from a random location. 
+ When coming back from a tab, the tabs in the group are rearranged visually (to match the new order in memory) if you've moved the tabs around in the tab bar 
+ Fixed an ugly bug where you could get trapped at an orphan tab (one that isn't in a group)
+ The tab bar for an orphaned tab shows all orphaned tabs.
+ You can now click-n-drag in empty space to create a group. If the group is too small, it will animate away (the cancel action) and if they group contains orphaned tabs, lo', it pulls those tabs into itself.
+ Changed the behavior of removing the penultimate tab from a group. The group no longer goes away until the very last tab is removed.
+ Removed tab bar control
+ Fixed a bug where closing the last tab in an un-named group would deposit you on a random tab. 
+ The "new tabs" group can now not be renamed or closed, but it can be moved and resized. Updated how item locking works to accommodate this.
+ Groups now have some extra space at the bottom to accommodate for the "new tab" button
+ added a =, fixing a problem with returning from a tab in a stacked group 
+ Fixed: The tab when dropped into the group is too small and place up and to the right
+ Fixed: On scale-up the tab is sometimes rotated.
+ Fixed: Sometimes on return to TabCandy the tabs are not aligned on the group. 
+ Reenabled the ability to exit title editing by clicking in empty space 
+ Fixed a number of issues with pulling tabs out of a tray. Temporarily disabled the delay on drag as well.
+ Added the concept of the "focused" tab.
+ The last tab you were viewing is now highlighted as the focused tab.
+ You can get back to the tab you were looking at now by hitting the escape key.
+ You can navigate to the focused tab by hitting the return key.
+ You can select other tabs via the keyboard with the arrow keys. 
+ Working on edge-cases for keyboarding around TabCandy
+ patch from Dietrich to get Tab Candy running in Minefield (disables listing of candies) 
+ Dragging a tab now causes it to become the focused tab.
+ Hitting return in a name field no longer causes the focused tab to zoom in 
+ If you close the selected tab, we now set the selected tab variable to null 
+ Fixed: Quit Firefox with TabCandy open then open Firefox again. Your tabs and and navbar get hidden.
+ Fixed: If you quit tab candy (but not the browser), all of the tabs need to be reshown.
+ Starting firefox with tab candy selected now hides the tab bar
+ Utils.activeTab now returns a Tabs tab, rather than a raw tab 
+ Dragging a group now selects a tab in the group
+ Fixed: Quit Firefox and relaunch. You'll reopen with that tab, but the tab bar doesn't have its tab limited to the containing group. It should limit them. 
+ Fixed tab escapees bug
+ If you click on a link in another app, the tab bar now does the right thing 
+ Removed uservoice, which was causing "new tab" groups to multiply
+ Fixed a bug whereby hitting return in the group name would zoom in on the selected tab. 
+ Updated the hover-state for dropping a tab into a group: * [P] The indication that you are dropping a tab onto a group should not be on the tab, but on the group.[Aza]
+ Fixed the following bug: If there's one tab in a group and you drag it out, the group will go away right away. If you drag back over it while it's fading out, you can get the red glow stuck on. At any rate, probably shouldn't delete the group until you've dropped the tab. 
 - The jQuery UI's draggable snap-to just wasn't specific enough for our use case
+ TODO: Need to add the snap ability to resizing groups 
Bug 566659 - Newly opened tabs do not appear in the TabCandy interface on Trunk 
+ fixed a bug causing you to have to hit the close box twice on a group to close it (once to close all of its tabs, a second time to close the group)
+ Now marshaling all Tabs events from the chrome thread to the dom thread (we're doing this when we receive them, not when Tabs sends them)
+ Fixed problem with bookmark bar not coming back after quitting Tab Candy
+ Straight jpg tabs now work (i.e. the reddit bug is fixed) 
+ You must now drag a tab a minimum distance to collapse the tray and remove the tab from the group 
+ Feature: When returning from a tab that is in a stack, arrange it at the top of the stack (but don't change its order in the children list)
+ TabItems now keeps track of all TabItem objects manually; we were using $('.tab:visible'), but this was causing bizarre behavior in certain cases 
+ fixed: if you quit firefox with tab candy present, and more than one window open, when you restart, everything will be broken
+ Tab Candy now only watches the window it's in. This fixes a number of issues, including some nasty ones with pop ups. This is a full fix for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567007 and a partial fix for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567006 
+ the TabCandy button/hot key now works to make a separate TabCandy for each window
+ Fixed a number of startup issues relating to multiple tab candies running at the same time 
+ Fixed a bug whereby the navbar and tabstrip weren't being properly hidden
+ Fixed a typo where errors in onFocus weren't being logged. (When you  go back to the TabCandy from a tab, the tab strip get hidden late,  causing a jarring jump)
+ Made TabCandy pretty a la http://www.stephenhorlander.com/pages/incontent-ui-mockups/incontent-ui-mockups.html#tabCandy
+ Major speed improvments based around not calling resize() when animating or hiding/showing chrome. Once again, TabCandy feels fast and zippy and awesome. 
+ Using the new-tab buttons no longer cause a jarring shift due to window chrome appearing. 
+ The keyboard shortcuts now act as toggles. That is, pressing them twice will zoom out to TabCandy and then back in. 
+ Pulled BrowserWatcher out of tabs.js
+ New "new tabs" group behavior and position
+ New "new tab" button position for the  "new tabs" group
+ New visual styling for the new tab group. So very very pretty. 
+ The first time you run TabCandy, it lays all of the tabs out in a grid (just like it used to; reinstating this feature)
+ Minor refactor for new tab button to make it more DRY 
+ Remove the title of the "New Tabs" at the suggestion of Beltzner
+ Made the titles more beautiful in the new tabs group. 
+ Added UserVoice back to TabCandy, but this time without pulling in untrusted code from the web into a privledged context.
+ Fixed [B] Drag a group (full of tabs) off the top of the window. Then drag the group  back. All of the tabs are gone! Now resize the group. They come back. Even better; don't let groups be dragged out of the window bounds! 
+ Groups now track their last-focused tab. When you click on the group, it brings you back to the group with the appropriate tab focused. 
+ The function you give to TabMirror.customize now takes a Mirror rather than a jQuery object
+ iQ is coming along. I tried to put asserts in for all the standard functionality that's missing (and that we might not need, but that someone used to jQuery might expect). I've also been adding Natural Docs comments, to give a sense of the scope+ Got rid of TabCanvas.animate(), which we haven't used in a while.
+ Fixed [B] Clicking on the new tab button in the new tab group causes a zoom to a tab. Clicking anywhere does the same. It shouldn't. 
+ Added a more discoverable reset button. 
+ Fixed a bug where rescaling a group would cause a zoom-in to a tab. 
+ removed sizzle reference from iQ.js license block, as it doesn't look like we'll be using any portion of jQuery that has sizzle (also, testing my ability to push to mozilla hg) 
+ First use of iQ.animate(), which uses CSS transitions: tab zoom up and down, as well as phantom group disappearing when you drag in empty space but don't make it big enough
+ Started on iQ for tabitems.js; now using iQ for TabItem.setBounds. We're not yet supporting the tabcandy bounce animation, so the tab movement boring now… to be fixed soon.
+ minor change, to test my ability to push to Mozilla's hg 
+ tabitems.js is now jQuery-free except for drag/drop/resize
+ Cleaned up usage of TabItems.getItemByTab and renamed it to getItemByTabElement to make it clearer 
+ groups.js is now jQuery-free except for drag/drop/resize and the newTab routine
+ Temporarily disabled TabMirror.pausePainting, which is causing problems at the moment (will fix soon) 
+ iQ.fn.animate now reliably calls back the completion routine (this was causing all sorts of trouble)
+ Reenabled TabMirror.pausePainting
+ Converted Group.newTab over to iQ (was the last jQuery bit besides drag/drop/resize) 
+ You can drop tabs onto groups (but no tabs on tabs yet)
+ Disabled resize for now
+ You can now drop tabs on tabs
+ Fixed some of the tab sizing issues (like when returning from a tab) 
+ Modified the  "front" class to remove unnecessary bits from the tab, and to turn on crisp edges, hopefully to speed things up 
animation speed from frame #1 (the tab) to frame #2 (the half-size image) to
+ Refactored zoom code into TabItem (was in TabItems and Page)
+ The "zoom prep", where the div is resized behind the scenes, is now much more robust; items can be rearranged while in this state (in response to new tabs opening, for instance), and everything still works out.
+ Group._activeTab is now a TabItem rather than a DOM element
+ Most of the old "mod" routine is now in the TabItem constructor; "mod" no longer exists 
+ Hitting the "new tab" button in a group no longer first takes you to the active tab in that group
+ Fixed a couple of "null tab" errors when calling storage.js
+ Fixed a couple of zooming issues related to closing tabs while you're in them 
+ closing a named group with tabs in it now works correctly
snapping for tabs as well as groups 
tabs now also project trenches; unregistering trenches on group/tab close; allow proportional resizing while snapping; preferLeft and preferTop flags for which edges to preferentially snap to 
+ tweak to how we deal with laying out small numbers of tabs in a group 
+ Cleaned up TabItem bounds getting and setting (the translation between our coordinates and the div style needs to be done carefully, in particular due to the padding in the tab style), and added a unit test for it 
new tab group should not project trenches 
moved to tracking trenches by id; better trench cleanup and garbage collection; refactored a bit to make things faster? but with questionable results 
+ fixed scoping issue that caused all tabs dropped in any group to return to a single group
+ fixed a bug causing tabs in the "new tabs" group to be huge 
+ No longer messing with the tabbar order for ungrouped tabs
+ groups.js is now fully documented (except for member variables) 
+ Fixed Bug 568882 - TabCandy should not reorder tabs 
+ Fixed: Bug 570089  - Dragging northwest in tabcandy area creates zero-area tab group 
+ Fixed: Bug 569846  - No hover help for "new tab" icons in tab group 
turned tabs into spaces; "Only snap to a trench when it is physically proximate" (result: http://img.skitch.com/20100619-cp6pdsbrien3phhi9rbn85jr3t.jpg); added isDragging flag to item itself 
more tabs into spaces 
moved shared resizeOptions core into Items; move edge-snapping code out into Drag.snapToEdge; make resizeOptions invoke Drag.snap so that it can take advantage of the advances in drag-snapping technology; made snapToEdge work with resizeable rects 
+ Commented out the click-on-group to zoom into the last active tab 
+ applied patch: Temp Fix: Bug 570565 - Background Tab Close buttons disappear 
+ Raymond's close button fix missed a couple cases: creating new tabs with command+click, and closing non-selected tabs with the close buttons in the tabbar. Fixed. 
+ In the quest to abolish reloadBounds(), I've rewritten draggable, droppable and resizable to operate on an item's bounds rather than directly on the div. I've also removed those routines from iQ, and integrated them into Item. Additional related cleanup and documentation.
now can drag tabs onto new tab tray... now getSafeWindowBounds does *not* use getPageBounds at all. 
some edges of TabItems were not projecting trenches on startup 
previous fix to new tab tray allowed tabs to be *resized* into the new tab tray as well. fixed. 
+ If a dragged item overlaps more than one droppable, the largest intersection wins
+ Modified the tabitem layout code so that favicons are more sensibly handled at smaller sizes. 
+ Cleaned up the code which changes the styling of a tabitems fav icon.
+ Added "refresh" to the dev menu (since you won't be able to just refresh the tabcandy page once it's in the xul:deck) 
+ applying Raymond's fix for Bug 565968  - tab-switching keyboard shortcuts iterate over all tabs not just the active subset 
Merge tabcandy to mozilla-central. 
Bug 572889 - Move TabCandy out of a tab and into a per-window xul:deck [r=iangilman]
Update code for tabCandy in xul:deck to not assume it's living in a tab and update various events and callbacks. 
Bug 572889 - Move TabCandy out of a tab and into a per-window xul:deck
Wrap the browser in a deck with an iframe for tabcandy. 
Merge updates to tabcandy to mozilla-central. 
Bug 574188 - Add UI hooks to trigger tab candy 
Bug 574188 - Include individual js pieces into tabcandy.js and expose content and skin files with jar.mn 
I was getting some errors about illegal values in arguments of getWindowValue; this seems to fix it. 
+ Fixed: Bug 575675 - FindChildWithRules aRelevantLinkVisited assertion when loading tabcandy page
+ The "code docs" item on the dev menu now opens the documentation from the repository into a new tab (used to open the local documentation, which doesn't exist in this new context, and replace the tab candy tab)
+ Fixed an accidental comma in tabcandy.css (was disabling the pointer cursor for tabs) 
+ Removed TabItems.reconstitute(), which we haven't actually needed for a while, but now it's also causing trouble
+ Removed Utils.activeWindow, which doesn't seem to work, and replaced its use in Utils.activeTab (the only remaining place it was being used) with Utils.getCurrentWindow(), which does seem to work
+ Fixed paths to the edit pencil and new tab button images; they should now show up properly 
Fix Bug 576424 - We need to know when sessionstore is available 
Fixed Bug 576393 - Tabs.onFocus() isn't working reliably 
+ the notion of stationaryCorner to the Trench logic. this value specifies which corner of a bound must remain stationary while resizing. Normally this is the topleft, but in the case of dragging out new tab groups, it actually could be another corner, which means the snapping computation is different. Fixes a couple minor resizing bugs. 
- modified "drag tab onto another tab" action's phantom group computation using getBoundingBox: now a touch more realistic.
- correcting my foolish ways: replacing some tabs with spaces. 
Show the tabcandy button at the right end of tabstrip 
+ added "all tabs" button back to the tab bar (restore defaults to see) 
Hides all tabs in the session restore so user won't see tabs get added and then removed 
Update several features for visible tabs: bookmark all tabs, reload all tabs, close other tabs, list all tabs drop down menu and tab context-menu 
+ Now storing item z separately from the DOM (as the DOM appears to be unreliable in our new world, at least at startup). This fixes issues with tabs not appearing in their groups at startup 
+ Moved our platform-independent tabcandy.css to browser/base/content/tabcandy/
+ Created a platform-specific css file for tabcandy in the theme directory.
+ Copied the Mac TabCandy theme additions into the Windows and Linux themes. 
refactored showOnlyTheseTabs (bug #577649) 
UI: added getAllTabs, inspired by Raymond's patch. cleaned up urlbar method. 
quickly patching a bug for new tab position in tab bar 
+ Create two groups; one with a single tab and another with several
tabs. Go into the single tab and then close the tab. You return to the
TabCandy interface as you should, but you see one of the other tabs
+ Cmd+e key combination is not working in the tab candy.
+ close buttons on tabs are still not showing correctly.  Add a bunch
of tabs to the tabstrip so all close buttons for background tabs are
hidden, go into Tab Candy interface and remove tabs until you know the
close buttons should appear.  Then, zoom into a tab and the close
UI: reusing getAllTabs more; killed getVisibleTabs as it was not doing what it stated... replaced with getVisibleTabCount 
* Create a new tab in a group which has  more than one tab. While in
tabcandy, close that tab. Now you're zoomed into the tab to its left.
You should instead remain in TabCandy.
UI: bugfix: rm reference to getVisibleTab(); doc fix 
UI: showOnlyTheseTabs: a faster way to find visibleTabs, by checking the associated tabbrowser 
Bug 577947: TabCandy toolbarbutton lacks styling on Windows and Linux. 
bug 577968: removing elses preceded by returns; replacing tabs 
Bug 576110: Open tab candy at startup if it was last open 
UI: tabOnFocus: refactored to no longer use doSetup; saveVisibility: no longer print log 
Merge mozilla-central to tabcandy-central. 
- TabItems: fixed bug where phantom trenches were created when a tab in a group is closed, but the group was not closed.
- BrowserTab: cleanup of getters 
+ Subscribable (in utils.js) no longer has a separate onClose path
+ Cleaned up a scope issue with Subscribable and added some guards 
Bug 576110: Show saved thumbnails at browser startup if tab candy was last open 
Bug 577445: Show tab candy title in the tab candy interface and change 'let' to 'var' 
+ Group.add now refuses to add a tab if it was already attached to another group, instead of just warning about it. Though maybe it should automatically remove it from the previous group?
+ Clicking on a non-stacked group now brings you to the last active tab in that group. 
Bug 579222 - Expose a .visibleTabs property on the tabbrowser [r=iangilman]
Add .visibleTabs to tabbrowser and use local dereferences instead of gBrowser when possible. 
+ Finished documenting all of the app code, plus utils.js. Remaining: iq.js, mirror.js, tabs.js 
Fixed Bug 579192: Fix keyboard navigation of Tabcand 
Fixed Bug 578927: Re-order tabs in a group in Tab Candy doesn't reflect on the tab bar 
Refactor Tabs.onReady method 
- Use Rect.css more consistently: gets rid of some spurious CSS unknown value warnings when moving trenches, and simplifies Item._updateDebugBounds and Group.setNewTabButtonBounds
Bug 579223: improved tab-dragged-onto-other-tab groups
Fixed Bug 579814 - Fix behavior of tab-manipulation keyboard shortcuts 
Create a copy of tabs parameters inside the showOnlyTheseTabs() 
Change a forEach to map in the showOnlyTheseTabs() 
Moved the hideCachedData call to the tabs.onLoad() and added an animation for switching from cached image to canvas 
rm TabMirror.customize abstraction, meaning we got rid of the only use of Tabs.tab() .
To get things to load correctly (after their dependencies have been loaded), the order of #includes was changed. We now load mirror.js right after tabitems.js, hopefully making it a bit easier to later merge them. 
Remove trailing spaces/tabs from tabcandy files. 
tabs cleanup: conservative commit 1
rm ImmutableArray, XULApp, Tabs.tab, and some other unused things. 
tabs cleanup: conservative commit 2
rm Extension, Dictionary. We are now attaching the BrowserTab and BrowserWindow objects to their respective chromeTab and chrome window objects as an attribute for lookup purposes.
Fixed Bug 580419 - Using option-space to enter Tabcandy doesn't work when in the the Awesome Bar or Search Bar 
Merge mozilla-central (4.0b2) to tabcandy-central with conflicts.

Fixed Bug 566865 - Define all Keyboard Shortcuts for TabCandy 
Get rid of _newTab to create tabs from the ui and remove feedback references. 
Bug 580870 - Alias gBrowser to the tabcandy context to remove getCurrentWindow
Add aliases for gWindow, gBrowser, gTabDeck, gTabFrame for the tabcandy chrome context. Update uses and simplify some code like removing Navbar. 
Bug 580901 - Directly call loadOneTab instead of Tabs.open
Remove Tabs.open and BrowserWindow.addTab and directly deal with xul tabs. 
Bug 580905 - Remove unused Tabs.focused window/tab and BrowserWindow reference
Don't save gWindow.tabcandyBrowserWindow but still create the BrowserWindow object for events. 
Bug 581052 - Don't grab Tabs[0] to get the tabbar for its tabs
Just grab gBrowser.tabs to get an array-list of tabs instead of jumping through Tabs[0].raw.parentNode.children hoops. 
Bug 581078 - Get rid of Utils.activeTab to avoid iterating over all Tabs
Directly access gBrowser.selectedTab and compare other raw tabs against it until BrowserTab goes away. Get the reference to the BrowserTab instead of iterating over Tabs through .tabcandyBrowserTab. 
Also, fixed font size changing on tab resizing. 
Bug 579223: using Aza's recommendation, centering tab-on-tab phantom group around the drop target tab (no snapping yet).
+ fixing font size adjustment while tabitem is resized 
Bug 579223: got snapping to work for tab-on-tab phantom groups. 
+ rewrote TabItem close button opacity and title font size using the new Range utilities. Should make code a tad easier to follow. 
Bug 580937 - Use plain xul:tabs instead of wrapping with BrowserTab
Don't expose BrowserTab and have Tabs give sugarless xul:tabs that don't need .raw-ing. Remove most of the BrowserTab functionality only to leave the event bits. 
Followup bug 580870 to rename gTabDeck/gTabFrame to gTabView*. 
Remove unnecessary isIframe as tab content document will be just inside a browser. 
Bug 581286 - Don't duplicate tabbox.advanceSelectedTab and key handling code
Prevent tabs from showing up in the tabbar by hiding them instead of collapsing so that existing tabbox code knows to skip over them. Remove key handling code except for activating tabcandy and switching groups. 
Followup to bug 580937 to implement TabItem.close with xul:tabs instead of BrowserTab. 
Merge "backout" of TabItem.close removal. 
Roll Tabbar methods into UIManager 
Don't save a tab that has no parent (it's closing). 
Bug 581732 - Merge mozilla-central to tabcandy-central 2010/07/24 (with conflicts). 
Bug 581736 - Show app tabs from any group
Don't hide app tabs but this will cause strange reorderings for now. 
Bug 580847 - Lots of unnecessary TabMove events 
Bug 581612 - Add showOnlyTheseTabs functionality to tabbrowser
Move and simplify showOnlyTheseTabs functionality into tabbrowser now that there's no reordering happening on show. 
Merge mozilla-central to tabcandy-central. 
Call updateTabBarForActiveGroup so that Group is correctly set for this. 
Bug 578147 - Backout tabbrowser.xml changes from bug 576393. 
+ A tab's thumbnail canvas its cached thumbnail image are now stacked on top of each other, which fixes some dragging bugs (during the brief time in the cached image is visible) 
Call setReorderTabsOnHide() when Groups.add() is called 
Bug 581894 - App tabs appear on top of normal tabs on startup [r=iangilman] 
Bug 580952 - Expose an Tabs module that handles tabs from all browser windows
Replace the existing Tabs/TabsManager object with the Tabs module that exposes allTabs, onChange, onClose, onMove, onOpen, onSelect. 
Don't show tab candy if closing the last tab and not in the tab candy view 
Merge mirror.js + tabitems.js:
- Merge TabMirror into TabItems
- Merge Mirror into TabItem
- TabItem now implements Subscribable, just like Group and InfoItem; rm addOnClose, removeOnClose and use addSubscriber, removeSubscriber directly; Item now checks that subclasses implement Subscribable
- merge Mirror + TabItem constructors; rm TabMirror/TabItems.createNewTab
- xul:tab no longer gets a .mirror added to it. Instead it now gets its TabItem set to .tabItem
- rm TabItems.getItemByTabElement, as it is no longer necessary
- Mirror used .el to store its DOM element... now just using .container, which TabItem used 
Merge: reimplementing some changes to mirror.js by Mardak into the corresponding parts of tabitems.js 
Merge mozilla-central to tabcandy-central. 
Followup to bug 580952 so that only tabs from the current window are handled. 
Move lazy gWindow, gBrowser, etc into tabcandy.js out of utils.js for bug 582023. 
Update the Tabs.onClose() to fix the unit test issues 
Move utils.js into a javascript module that exports Point, Rect, Range, Subscribable, and Utils for bug 582023. 
Bug 583044 - Rename code references of TabCandy to TabView
Move files and update references to tabview from tabcandy. Only remaining candy reference is the link to aza's webm video. 
+ Removed the big reset button (it is still available in the dev menu) 
+ Removed TabItems._heartbeat, in favor of a more direct event-based approach (more to come on this front)
+ Cleaned up a bunch of unneeded properties and methods in tabitems.js
+ moved profile.js to the top of tabcandy.js, so the script loading timer is accurate 
+ Improved startup sequence: don't do anything until sessionstore is available, and then do only minimal work if we're not loading directly into the UI; most setup now happens when we first show the UI. Known issue: tabs aren't set up properly in the tab bar until after you go to the UI once.
+ more tabItems cleanup, including removing a stray call to the now non-existent TabCanvas.detach()
Make sure user facing names refer to Tab Sets for now for bug 583044. 
Bug 583434 - Unable to deselect tab group title when giving new title or renaming 
Bug 582116 - Provide a way to show certain tabs and get visible tabs
Add showOnlyTheseTabs and visibleTabs to tabbrowser and update various uses such as tab selection. Test that tabs get hidden/shown when using this API and tab selection only deal with visible tabs while making sure there's always a visible tab. 
Merge mozilla-central and bug 582116 to tabcandy-central. 
Bug 583711 - name field for tab group in candy 
+ Commented out the "refresh" and "reset" items on the dev menu in response to Bug 584372 (Firefox will crash if either Refresh or Reset in the Dev menu of the Visual Tab Interface is selected); we may bring these back in the future if needed for dev work, but they won't be in the shipping version. 
+ Tab thumbnails once again update themselves when their size changes
+ TabItem updates (painting, etc) no longer happen when the Tab Candy UI is not visible; they're queued up and happen when you return to the UI
+ Fixed a couple problems with the TabItems pause painting mechanism
+ If a whole bunch of TabItem updates come at the same time, we spread them out (using a heartbeat that lasts until we run out of backlog)
+ This should fix both Bug 580954 (Replace the heartbeat with something smarter) and Bug 583420 (Tab thumbnails don't repaint after being resized) 
Bug 575851: new tab experience, part 1:
- removed new tab group (you may have to clear storage to get rid of your locked New Tabs group at the bottom of your screen)
- rm various special casing for the new tab group
- new tab experience for tabs-off-of-orphaned-tabs is implemented: they magically turn into a group, and it even snaps!
- broken: new tabs made with no active context

quick touchup to GroupItems.getnextGroupItemTab 
Bug 585148 - Showing tabcandy for the first time results in many showOnlyTheseTabs 
rm setSize during tabs' group-removal. Bottom line: tabs no longer shrink and block jerk the dragging when being dragged out of a group. 
Bug 585155 - Zoom in animation doesn't work when adding a new tab in tab candy interface 
Moved tests to test/tabview folder 
Merge mozilla-central to tabcandy-central. 
+ Made the Groups.killNewTabGroup test a little tighter (in case someone has made a group called "new tabs")
Move private variables/methods into local declarations not exported by AllTabs and change the interface to .register("change") instead of .onChange() for bug 584532. 
Bug 585850 - Rename TabCandy modules from *.js to *.jsm (like the rest of js modules) 
Merge mozilla-central to tabcandy-central. 
Bug 585837 - Tests for launching Tab candy 
Bug 585858: test tab context menu items with combinations of visible and hidden tabs 
+ TabView actions that require loading the frame (if not loaded) now wait properly until the frame is loaded before continuing. These actions are show, context menu, and "next group" key combo.
+ TabView now has explicit show and hide in addition to toggle
+ removed the "beforeclose" event from TabItem and cleaned up the "close" event
+ Removed the "urlChanged" event from TabItem; inlining that code instead. 
Run the TabCandy tests from the correct Makefile 
Disable all TabView tests for now

+ Saving TabView visibility status as a straight string, to save from having to JSON during start up 
++ Unnecessary double if in tabbrowser.xml
++ Renamed platform.css files to tabview.css 
+ I forgot to update the references to the newly renamed tabview.css files; fixed

about:startup - record timestamp early on in the XRE setup 
about:startup - about page implemented as static html/js using the redirector, rather than an independant nsIAboutModule 
about:startup - PR_IntervalNow is kinda dumb. It makes no special attempt to be monotonic like the docs say, and additionally there's no way to equate it back to a real timestamp (which the docs do imply). Using PR_Now instead. 
about:startup - record a timestamp once session restore has finished, and display it and the duration between it and the app startup timestamp on the about:startup page 
about:config - implement nsXULAppInfo::GetLaunchTimestamp for linux

about:startup - show the legend 
about:startup - hide empty message when the duration table isn't empty 
about:startup - small cleanup 
about:startup - take a stab at setting the colors of the graph 
about:startup - add the code that will display extension events as marks on the graph. also adds some boilerplate to make serializing async code easy again and uses it to serialize different queries to the database 
about:start - let the user toggle between graphs and tables, with graphs as the default 
use the correct query for the events table 
about:startup - hide the platform version/build fields from the duration table, because in Firefox the platform version changes only when the app version changes 
about:startup - propagate theme chages to the other themes 
about:startup - fix sql syntax error (oops) 
about:startup - remove mention of aboutStartup.css from faststripe

Bug 646157: Prevent 2^n growth in event dispatch in a chain of nested labels. r=smaug
Prior to this patch, Gecko allowed bubbling click events to trigger multiple <label>s, and for the synthetic click events generated by <label>s to also trigger additional <label>s.  In contrast, Opera allows only the latter, and Webkit/IE allow neither.  Gecko's behavior leads to 2^n events being dispatched in the case of markup like:
<label for="thing1" /><input type="foo" name="thing1" />
<label for="thing2" /><input type="foo" name="thing2" />
After this patch a bubbling click event triggers at most one <label>, and the synthetic click event cannot trigger additional labels.  Our behavior is still not identical to Webkit/IE though, because in Gecko a click event will still bubble up past a <label>, while in Webkit/IE the click event will stop at the <label>.

Add Debug.prototype.enabled. This implementation is not ideal, since we want clearing .enabled to remove the debugger from every place where it might cause overhead. For now it just sets a flag. 
If a Debug.Object’s existence is somehow observable, keep it alive. This means it is alive if it has expandos or is a key of a live WeakMap. Since we have no way of telling when those things are true, simply mark as if each referent had a strong reference back to each corresponding Debug.Object. 
Add Debug.Object.prototype.callable. 
Fix up treatment of Debug.Frame objects during GC. Frames were not being marked properly during Debug::trace and were being swept from the table during Debug::sweepCompartment.

Don't mark objects from a Debug's ephemeral tables unless the Debug itself has been marked.

Support disabling debug mode in a compartment with scripts on the stack. Dump the debug-mode JIT code during a later GC.

The bindX() commands were erroring with INVALID_VALUE when they're instead supposed to simply fail silently when they're given a deleted object. Additionally, the getParameter() function was failing after its associated variable was deleted, sometimes returning values when it should return null.
There was actually some surrounding logic breaking 0-size textures. It was because there was code that basically checked "did uint=negative_num*other_vars overflow". For incorrect validation, two copies of the same variable (one stored internally and one passed in) were available to the function, but the one stored internally was being validated, while the version passed in wasn't. The fix for this was simply checking the passed var instead.

Bug 659828 - Part 1: Apply table margins to the outer table frame instead of the inner table frame (also fixes bug 87277); r=dbaron
Outer table frames act as CSS2.1 table wrapper boxes.  We used to lay them out
always equal to the available width.  This breaks horizontal positioning of
absolutely positioned kids of a table frame.
The main purpose of this patch is to apply the margins of tables to their outer
frame, instead of the inner frame.  This means that the inner table frame will
rely on the fact that table margins are applied to the inner frame need to
In particular, in order to get the computed margins of a table, we used to query
the inner table frame, and this patch corrects that.  Also, when shrink wrapping
tables, we used to not take the margins of the inner table frame into account,
top/bottom margins of the table, and that the margins of the caption element
contribute to the width and height of the outer table frame.  The
427129-table-caption reftest has been modified to match this new behavior.

I'm adding asserts about when we do and don't have a Location object behind the wrapper, and this case was hitting them. What we do here doesn't so much matter given how this stuff all works. On the one hand, statically using a restrictive policy is slightly more defense-in-depth. On the other hand, if this stuff is broken we're screwed in much more serious ways than content reading chrome locations, and using a consistent wrapper scheme allows us to make stronger asserts and assumptions.
I opted for stronger assumptions and more understandable security code. If Blake feels strongly though, I could go the other way and sprinkle '|| isChrome(obj)' throughout the asserts though. 
The current situation seems incorrect, especially given the behavior of CrossOriginWrapper and XrayProxy. Currently it doesn't matter, but it probably will in the future.

Bug 776602: about:home logo should be behind thumbnails. [r=wesj] 
The fuzzers currently infer the build configuration based on the presence or absence of various flags, and gkw noted that this will not work with JSGC_ROOT_ANALYSIS, so I thought it'd be nice to add something more direct. This is a stub set for now. 
Currently, JS::Rooted<JSObject*> requires the full definition of JSObject to be available (due to RootMethods<JSObject*>::kind() calling JSObject::rootKind()). This patch switches to using a RootKind<T> template that is explicitly specialized in jspubtd.h for externally-visible pointer types, but still falls back on T::rootKind() for other pointer types so that we don't need to explicitly specialize on eg all subclasses of JSString or JSObject.

Anyway, I suspect this case isn't worth worrying about as long as we don't crash. 
Implements a media.mozGetMetadata() method returning a new javascript object whose properties are key value pairs respresenting metadata tags from the media resource. This data is available after readystate enters METADATA_LOADED.
Media format metadata is parsed out by the media decoders. In the nsCodecStateMachine::ReadMetadata subclasses we fill in an nsDataHashtable pointer using the format-specifc api.
The hash is deleted if the load is aborted. The audio metadata is also reset to zero (as in the constructor), resolving a todo comment.

The nsCSSValue in nsGenericHTMLElement::MapBackgroundInto is a temporary.  This causes a problem after Bug 697230 landed, because the nsCSSValue::Image we put into that value is destroyed once we're done doing style stuff.  Previously the nsImageLoader would grab the request off the nsCSSValue::Image and hold it alive.  Bug 697230 changed the behavior here; now when the nsCSSValue::Image is destroyed it tells the image loader to drop the request.  The result is that all the references to the request are dropped and the frame is never told it has a background.
The solution is to keep the nsCSSValue::Image alive longer.  This patch adds two new types of nsAttrValue.  The first is an nsCSSValue::URL.  A ParseBackgroundAttribute method is added on nsGenericHTMLElement that the relevant elements (body/td/th/table/tr/tbody/thead/tfoot) call that parses background into an nsCSSValue::URL.  The second is an nsCSSValue::Image.  nsGenericHTMLElement::MapBackgroundInto attempts to convert the nsCSSValue::URL into an nsCSSValue::Image by kicking off the image load.  The result is that image loads are only started when the element is actually visible.  This also mirrors the way background-image works.  This also allows us to fix two longstanding bugs in this code.  Since MapBackgroundInto doesn't have a pointer to the actual element, it relied on grabbing the principal of the document.  Now we can grab the principal of the node in ParseBackgroundAttribute.  MapBackgroundInto also has no way to get at the element's base URI (to honor xml:base), which is now possible in ParseBackgroundAttribute.

Bug 795136 - 3/2 - Disabling tests until bug 795711 is fixed. r=me 
This patch enables sharing of an nsAttrValue's MiscContainer between nodes for style rules.  MiscContainers of type eCSSStyleRule are now refcounted (with some clever struct packing to ensure that the amount of memory allocated for MiscContainer remains unchanged on 32 and 64 bit).  This infrastructure can be used to share most MiscContainer types in the future if we find advantages to sharing other types than just eCSSStyleRuley.  A cache mapping strings to MiscContainers has been added to nsHTMLCSSStyleSheet.  MiscContainers can be shared between nsAttrValues when one nsAttrValue is SetTo another nsAttrValue or when there is a cache hit in this cache.  This patch also adds the ability to tell a style rule that it belongs to an nsHTMLCSSStyleSheet, with appropriate accessor functions to separate that from the existing case of belonging to an nsCSSStyleSheet.
The primary use case is to reduce memory use for pages that have lots of inline style attributes with the same value.  This can happen easily with large pages that are automatically generated.  An (admittedly pathological) testcase in Bug 686975 sees over 250 MB of memory savings with this change.  Reusing the same MiscContainer for multiple nodes saves the overhead of maintaining separate copies of the string containing the serialized value of the style attribute and of creating separate style rules for each node.  Eliminating duplicate style rules enables further savings in layout through style context sharing.  The testcase sees the amount of memory used by style contexts go from over 250 MB to 10 KB.

The first valid SkipRoot I've found. copyFromArray was inexplicably discarding a handle, and with that fixed there are some unrooted internal pointers stored on the stack. But the only things that can trigger GC will also trigger an early exit, so all of the unrooted pointers are dead if a GC happens anyway. 
I didn't expect to have to specify -o in addition to -O. I get that you might want to use -s instead of -o, but -o is probably much more common.

Bug 816498: Fix some things about background attribute handling that are still broken. r=bz
As filed the bug is about table backgrounds failing to print.  The root cause of this is that we load images from the original document, because print/print-preview documents (which are static clones of the original) cannot do loads.  This results in an entry in the css::ImageValue's request table under the original document, but entry under the printing document.  Then we do layout, try to get the request, and fail, and nothing is displayed.  The solution to this is to force us to clone the request for the printing document if we're loading off the original document.  I manually verified that this does not regress Bug 560235.
While writing a test for this, we discovered another problem.  The reftest print code does not actually use the printing codepath.  Instead it takes an existing document, tears down its presshell, and creates a new presshell for printing.  Fixing the above bug did not make the reftest print test pass because ImageLoader does not deal properly with presshell destruction/recreation.  It assumes that when the presshell is destroyed all of the css::ImageValues can be cleared of their entries for that document.  This fails for ImageValues for mapped attributes because they are held alive by the content tree.  When a new presshell for this document is then created there is no entry for the document and thus no image request to paint.  The fix for this is to only clear the frame to request and request to frame mapping hashtables and not to clear the document's entry on the ImageValue when the presshell is destroyed.  The destruction of the ImageLoader (which is held from a strong reference on the document) is when those entries are removed.  The final change is to change css::ImageValue's hashtable from holding a strong reference to the keys (which are documents) to holding raw pointer references.  This is safe because we clear the relevant entry when the corresponding ImageLoader dies, and is needed to prevent a reference cycle that was being broken by presshell destruction.

Bug 653881 - Rework XBL insertion points and clean up related code to more closely follow the Web Components model. Instead of maintaining a hashtable of insertion points in bindings (and removing insertions points from the tree) leave the insertion points in the tree as explicit placeholders and teach all other relevant code how to walk the explicit children of elements via two iterators (ExplicitChildIterator and FlattenedChildIterator). Note that this patch does not maintain 100% compatibility with the previous code: there are bug fixes and behavior changes included. For example, by having explicit insertion points in the bindings, it is now easier to handle dynamic changes to the bound element correctly (as well as, eventually, handling dynamic changes to the binding correctly). Patch originally by sicking. r=bzbarsky

Desc: Merge pull request #10709 from fabi1cazenave/l10nOptim-bug853933
Author: Fabien Cazenave <fabien@cazenave.cc>
The inline JSON dictionary is split on a per-locale basis (= one `<script>` node per supported locale) and only contains the l10n strings that are required to translate the HTML document: the "startup cost" of each locale becomes neglectable, and it removes the risk of high RAM consumption when parsing a giant multi-locale JSON at startup.
All l10n resources that are not declared in the HTML document are concatenated in a single JSON dictionary per locale: this reduces the number of disk I/O to load l10n resources and does not increase the total disk size of each webapp.  To enable this, this patch implements a `{{locale}}` quasi-litteral in the HTML markup that is used to declare l10n resources:
Note that this latter optimization is only interesting for apps that wait for the `localized` event to start. With the inline JSON dictionary for the declarative content and the `mozL10n.localize()` method, most apps could probably stop waiting for this `localized` event now.

Author: Fabien Cazenave <fabien@cazenave.cc>
Attachment containers use `<iframe>` in the SMS app because they are handy in the Compose area (work well in a contenteditable element): this ensures that attachment blocks are deletable but not editable.  However, `<iframes>` are a pain to use in the message thread, and can become a performance killer on threads with lots of attachments.

- When all recipients are deleted, don't leave empty editable in the to-field.
- When the editable placeholder is contracted to a zero offset width, it's possible to accidentally tap a recipient when the intention is to tap the to-field area around the recipient list, which will correctly prompt the user to remove the recipient. Since there is no way to unambiguously detect the user's intention, always handle "Remove" and "Cancel" in an intuitive way.

bug 866304. In metro, use the tab-modal prompt implementation that is available in toolkit. r=mbrubeck
This patch replaces metro's 'PromptService' (which implements nsIPromptService and nsIPrompt, among others) with an implementation that simply forwards all calls to toolkit's nsPrompter.js. Before forwarding each call, it writes the "allowTabModal" property on the object obtained from nsPrompter.js, causing the created prompt to be tab-modal.
It also adds functionality to browser.js for creating tab modal prompts. One of the changes made as part of adding this functionality is replacing the <browser> with a <stack> of <browser> objects. 
The "dialog" concept is unused (the last consumer was the sync setup UI which is now a flyout) and is obsolete since we have prompts. 
The crash reporter prompt is the only consumer of DialogUI.importModal and related code. The "modals" concept that DialogUI implements should go away in favor of tab-modal dialogs and tab-agnostic notifications (e.g. flyouts). I don't think that the crash reporter prompt should be a tab modal dialog; I'd prefer to see it become an about: page or perhaps a flyout. Making it a tab-modal prompt was just the easiest thing to do in this set of patches.

This defines a CSSVariableDeclarations class that holds a set of

Bug 773296 - Part 7: Add a field to nsStyleVariables to store computed variable values. r=dbaron
This defines a class CSSVariableValues which is used to store
computed variable values.  We store them a bit differently from
CSSVariableDeclarations -- here we have a hash table of variable names
to integer IDs, and then an array of variables where the array index
is the ID.  This is because later on we'll want a stable order for the
variables to return from DOM APIs.
In addition to the string value of the variable, we store the type
of the first and last token of the variable value.  This information
will be used when resolving entire variable reference containing
We add a CSSVariableValues member to nsStyleVariables. 
Bug 773296 - Part 8: Resolve and compute CSS variables. r=dbaron
We add a new class CSSVariableResolver whose job is to take the
inherited computed variables and the specified variable declarations and
to perform cycle removal and resolution of the variables, storing the
result in the CSSVariableValues object on an nsStyleVariables.  We use
CSSVariableResolver in nsRuleNode::ComputeVariablesData.
The variable resolver does this:
  1. Asks the CSSVariableValues and CSSVariableDeclarations objects
     to add their variables to it.
     EnumerateVariableReferences that informs the resolver which
     other variables a given variable references, and by doing so,
     builds a graph of variable dependencies.

Generally, if you want a decltype(nullptr)-based overload, you should use SFINAE and IsNullPointer.  (Examples are provided in NullPtr.h comments.)  The problem is NullptrT matches far more than just __null as emulated nullptr for gcc 4.4/4.5 overloading purposes.  This problem is unavoidable without true nullptr.  Currently, the only valid use for NullptrT is believed to be in operator overloads.  All existing nullptr-overloading code has been rewritten to use the appropriate technique for the situation, and MOZ_HAVE_CXX11_NULLPTR is no longer an API.

* Made the DebuggerClient, which is actually the RootActor front, not consider one of the attached child fronts as "active". Since a single DebuggerClient (or RootFront) is kept around for the App Manager's lifetime, it makes sense to move the notion of "active" tab to the toolbox's target. As each toolbox gets destroyed, the fronts should be detaching from their actors (if they are stateful) so that the app is no longer in a debugging state. Debugging a new app (or reconnecting to a previous one) will create new fronts anyway.
* Slightly refactored the TabClient, ThreadClient, SourceClient and TracerClient towards a protocol.js-based architecture, by adding parent-child references and lifecycle management. Now a tab-scoped thread actor for instance has the tab as its parent, while a global-scoped thread actor (chrome debugger) has the DebuggerCLient (RootFront) as its parent. This lets parents reference their children, so that caching in the target object can work. It also allowed me to move some methods from the DebuggerClient to the actual front that should be responsible, like reconfigureTab, reconfigureThread and attachThread. These methods now use DebuggerClient.requester, too.

The purpose of this change is to make the code less confusing (since it's not clear to me why one would check HasTransform here), and in general to reduce the number of callers of HasTransform, since HasTransform is a complicated check that checks too many things and probably isn't the right thing for many of its callers (see, e.g., bug 968555).

This has two desirable side effects. The first and more important is that it prevents a scrollbar item from sitting between scroll layer items and preventing them from merging into one and thus preventing the creation of an async scrollable layer. The second is that scrollbars should be on top of the content they are scrolling in general, and this will make that happen in more cases.

ES6 specifies [[Set]] as an operation taking both a "this" object and a "receiver" parameter. Both JSObject::setGeneric and Proxy::set support the receiver parameter, but ObjectOps::setGeneric does not; in this patch, we add a little workaround for that. The test shows how this is observable using only standard builtins.
The changes in JSObject::setElement are untestable since currently all call sites pass the same value for obj as for receiver.

Bug 1096371 - Tabs with notifications too dark on Dev Edition Light theme;r=dao 
Modern OSs adjust process scheduling based on CPU-boundedness and Interface-boundedness.  A process performing a lot of UI tasks requires lower-latency than a CPU-bound process.  For this reason, at least on Windows (but probably also Linux and Mac), in e10s, resize events are sent at a much higher rate than non-e10s, where the main process has to do the work to respond to them.  This was supposed to be handled by the 'compress' option in IPDL but its duplicate-event test was very imprecise - it only tested the *oldest* message in the queue.  This patch searches the messagequeue/deque to remove *any* duplicate.  deque::erase is linear but this is a very uncommon case - currently only two compressed IPDL messages exist in the entire code base.  Also, these queues are small.

By making SessionStore accept :setupSyncHandler and :update messages from <xul:browser>s without a tab assigned we can preload a <xul:browser> in the background and assign a tab later. SessionStore will have the correct sync handler and know about the current content loaded in that browser. If the browser will never be assigned to a tab the received data will simply be discarded when the browser goes away due to the use of WeakMaps in SessionStore.

left with that enabled, but reduces the exposed code surface while
we're trying to stabilize things enough to ship support. 
This patch makes us behave similarly to when we're using the BasicCompositor, essentially we will clip all drawing to the final display to the area that was labeled as invalid. When DXGI 1.2 is available we will then also report the damaged area to the Present call so that can then be used to minimize the amount of bits that actually need to be blitted to the screen. Since we're no longer recompositing the whole screen this means we should also only clear the damaged area of the window. 
Currently when the usage of surface sharing is broken on certain drivers, be block D3D11 entirely and fall back to Basic composition. There's no real benefit in this case from disabling D3D11 entirely, and we might as well just use it with software composition like we do when we don't have Direct2D, and in addition to that disable texture sharing for webGL, falling back to slow WebGL which again is no worse than the situation when using Basic or D3D9 composition. 
Bug 1102499: Use WARP by default when D3D11 is available. r=BenWa
This will cause us to use WARP for composition on systems with Direct3D 11 when hardware acceleration is blacklisted or we're unable to find a powerful enough graphics card. It also allows us to force WARP on, in that situation WARP will also be used for Direct2D content rendering if Direct2D is enabled. Essentially this will ensure all systems running Windows 7 or higher always use D3D11 as their composition backend.

TabParents now register for the MozUpdateWindowPos event on the chrome TopWindowRoot. When the window is moved, the OS widget calls WindowMoved on its listener (the nsWebShellWindow), which sends a MozUpdateWindowPos event. 
Change the PuppetWidget from defining screen coordinates from tab-content-relative to being based on actual screen geometry. PuppetWidgets can have position. In the parent process, the widget has a position and a separate client position (that includes OS window chrome... on Linux and Windows as others have no chrome). In the child process, the widget (non-origin) position, whose calculation compensates for the OS window decoration.

The existing setup saves a branch. We can't keep it. All that code is about to be completely rewritten. In the standard algorithms, this check is not immediately followed by a branch on this particular condition (desc.hasValue()). Furthermore, to deal with resolve hooks properly, we will later change the condition of this if-statement to something like `if (resolving)`, which will not be something we can common up with any other branch in this function.

This also makes some changes to MutableHandle<PropertyDescriptor>, for convenience:
*   Make setWritable() clear the JSPROP_IGNORE_READONLY bit if present. (Breaking the symmetry a bit, it won't change *this from an accessor descriptor to a data descriptor. Instead, it asserts you're not doing that.)

When running test_animations_omta.html there is a zoom of 1.306122 applied, and the page is scrolled down to 67 screen pixels (before the test starts, not sure why exactly). Gecko scrolls as close to 67 screen pixels as it can: 67/1.306122 = 51.29689 css pixels, which is 3077.813 appunits. Gecko scrolls to 3078 app units. When AsyncCompositionManager::TransformScrollableLayer runs we calculate the scroll position of gecko and the current scroll position that the pan zoom controller is using. Since there are no async pan or zoom operations taking place these should match. However when the gecko scroll position is calculated we get 3078/60*1.306122 = 67.0040586. So it applies a transform of 0.0040586 to the container layer for the transform that test_animations_omta.html is animating off main thread. When test_animations_omta.html reads the transform of this layer it fails because it's expecting 0 and 0.0040586 is outside of it's epsilon for considering it to be close enough.

  be used in nsStaticCaseInsensitiveNameTable, thus avoiding manual
  PLD_HashTable{Init,Finish}() calls.

Bug 1179909: Refactor stable state handling. r=smaug
1. Our concept of recursion depth is broken for things that run from AfterProcessNextEvent observers (e.g. Promises). We decrement the recursionDepth counter before firing observers, so a Promise callback running at the lowest event loop depth has a recursion depth of 0 (whereas a regular nsIRunnable would be 1). This is a problem because it's impossible to distinguish a Promise running after a sync XHR's onreadystatechange handler from a top-level event (since the former runs with depth 2 - 1 = 1, and the latter runs with just 1).
1. Consolidate some handling of microtasks and all handling of stable state from appshell and WorkerPrivate into CycleCollectedJSRuntime.
2. Make the recursionDepth counter only available to CycleCollectedJSRuntime (and its consumers) and remove it from the nsIThreadInternal and nsIThreadObserver APIs.
4. Introduce the concept of metastable state to replace appshell's RunBeforeNextEvent. Metastable state is reached after every microtask or task is completed. This provides the semantics that bent and I want for IndexedDB, where transactions autocommit at the end of a microtask and do not "spill" from one microtask into a subsequent microtask. This differs from appshell's RunBeforeNextEvent in two ways:
b) It no longer ensures that we're at the same event loop depth in the native event queue. bent decided we don't care about this.
5. Reorder stable state to happen after microtasks such as Promises, per HTML. Right now we call the regular thread observers, including appshell, before the main thread observer (XPConnect), so stable state tasks happen before microtasks.

The calculation of |explicit| relies on the synchronous |getReportsForThisProcess|, once we have asynchronous reporters this will no longer work. As it is currently referenced in the about::memory tests we can just remove it. 
|getReportsForThisProcess| differs from |getReports| in that it is limited to current process and is synchronous. When asynchronous memory reporters are added the function will no longer be able tobe synchronous. There isn't much utility in only measuring the current process, so we can remove the function and switch existing users to |getReports|.

Bug 1212430 - Remove CrashAtUnhandlableOOM() and replace with AutoEnterOOMUnsafeRegion r=jandem 
This initial query to clear the database was initially removed because of the removal of the appId column, and replaced with the following logic which parses the origin strings to obtain the appId property, and then removes those entries using `AddInternal`. Unfortunately, during a rebase, it appears as though the code crept back into the codebase.
I'm not sure why this codepath wasn't ever tested before bkelly noticed it, but we should probably add a test of some form which actually runs the RemovePermissionsForApp codepath, to ensure that it actually works.

For root scroll frames we need information about the async scrolling (or lack thereof) of the scroll frame before we get to ScrollFrameHelper::BuildDisplayList for the scroll frame. We need it in nsLayoutUtils::PaintFrame and nsSubdocumentFrame::BuildDisplayList. So we factor out all the code responsible for async scrolling decisions into one function we can call from all three places.

The calculation of |explicit| relies on the synchronous |getReportsForThisProcess|, once we have asynchronous reporters this will no longer work. As it is currently referenced in the about::memory tests we can just remove it. 
|getReportsForThisProcess| differs from |getReports| in that it is limited to current process and is synchronous. When asynchronous memory reporters are added the function will no longer be able tobe synchronous. There isn't much utility in only measuring the current process, so we can remove the function and switch existing users to |getReports|.

This fixes a type bug in CSSVariableDeclarations::MapRuleInfoInto(). The
existing code passes aRuleData->mVariables.get(), which has type
|CSSVariableDeclarations*|, into the |void*| parameter to EnumerateRead(). It
then extracts that in EnumerateVariableForMapRuleInfoInto() via a cast to a
different type, |nsDataHashtable<nsStringHashKey, nsString>*|. It's missing an
intermediate access of CSSVariableDeclarations::mVariables.
mVariables is the only field in CSSVariableDeclarations, so
mVariables->mVariables is at the same address as mVariables.

Bug 1101885: P4. Enable Intel VP8/VP9 HW decoder by default. r=cpearce 
The VideoInfo data now contains accurate and up to date information about the video display size, its aspect ratio and borders.
While the WMF can determine those values for H264 through the SPS NAL, it can't be done reliably for a VP9 stream.

This removes the "aStopAtAncestor" argument to agr computing functions. In most cases an AGR was passed for the stop at ancestor, so we'd stop at it anyway since it was an AGR. Most of the remaining cases the root reference frame was passed. And in a few cases something else was passed, which we probably don't want (returning something that isn't an AGR and isn't the root reference frame as an AGR).
In addition we change an assert because if we are painting to the window then our root reference frame is either a root frame, or a popup frame. In either case we should not be able to get to out of flows outside of the frame subtree rooted at the root reference frame by following placeholders.

Bug 1215974. In GetNearestScrollableFrame don't skip the root scroll frame if we are asked to always match the root scroll frame even if it doesn't WantAsyncScroll(). r=botond
SCROLLABLE_ALWAYS_MATCH_ROOT should take precendence over SCROLLABLE_ONLY_ASYNC_SCROLLABLE as if we fail to find the root scroll frame we will have no usable scroll frame at all. 
Bug 1215977. Only match the root scroll frame in GetNearestScrollableFrame if we encounter it. r=botond
This allows the use of GetNearestScrollableFrame to walk up the frame tree without getting into a infinite loop going from root scroll frame to root frame and back.
The only other type of frame that will be affected when calling GetNearestScrollableFrame are viewport (root) frames. However, the only user of SCROLLABLE_ALWAYS_MATCH_ROOT (APZCCallbackHelper) calls GetNearestScrollableFrame on the result of a hit test on a display list. Viewport frames never create any display items whose HitTest function could return the viewport frame. 
Bug 1215977. Add a flag for GetNearestScrollable that makes fixed pos frames return the root scroll frame of their document. And make APZCCallbackHelper use it to restore previous behaviour. r=botond

DOM Storage is a pretty inefficient and memory-hungry storage mechanism. Session Store attempts to record DOM Storage for each tab, which leads to (possibly very large) objects being serialized once to be sent from frame/content to parent and once to be sent from the main thread to the I/O thread. This is a suspect behind a number of crashes (see bug 1106264 for a discussion on the topic).

clang reports a -Wunreachable-code warning for sigemptyset() because Darwin's sigemptyset() is a macro that always returns 0. Thus `if (sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask) < 0)` is always false and `Abort("sigemptyset() failed")` is never called. Linux's sigemptyset() can return 0 or -1.

Before changing the handling of experiments make the tests a bit more readable
* They can always be enabled regardless of compatibility info
* They default to disabled when installed
* They only stay enabled for the lifetime of the current process
* The UI doesn't give users the ability to enable/disable
Being able to use regardless of compatibility was mostly fixed by bug 1220198 but I've also removed the redundant override in isCompatible.
Previously the "enabled until restart" feature worked with by not updating the DBAddonInternal object and instead using a hack to make the wrapper still seem enabled. This seems likely to break other code that relies on the state of the DBAddonInternal object so instead we update that as normal and simply don't persist the enabled state to disk.
I've removed the hack from addon.permissions which was hiding the enable/disable buttons in the UI and instead just hidden them in the UI stylesheet. This makes the API make sense and means callers can use addon.permissions to verify that enabling will work.
