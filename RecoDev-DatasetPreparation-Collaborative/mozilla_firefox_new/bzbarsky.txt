Address bzbarsky's final review comments (comment 14) on bug 311415: consider ch units fixed as well. 
Change the FrameNeedsReflow API to pass the dirty flags to be added directly tothe method, instead of setting them before calling the method.  That way we canavoid reflowing the ancestor of a reflow root which is not itself dirty but hasdirty children.  This also makes it harder to set dirty bits inconsistentlywith the FrameNeedsReflow call.  Bug 378784, r+sr=dbaron, pending rbs' reviewon the mathml parts.

Additionally, change the tokenization of a hash (#) followed by a non-name character or EOF to tokenize as DELIM (eCSSToken_Symbol) rather than as eCSSToken_Hash.

Bug 697351.  Implement has() on the nodelist proxy handler so that we don't have to do the property descriptor song and dance for it.  r=peterv 
There are two changes here.  The first is that the aCheckEdgeOnly case is factored out into a separate branch so as to avoid branching on aCheckEdgeOnly inside the sibling loop.  This also allows us to reuse the IndexDetermined code for both aIsFromEnd and !aIsFromEnd cases.  In particular, when aIsFromEnd we start by walking backwards and hoping for a cached index on a previous sibling and only walking forwards if that fails.  For short child lists there's not that much of a difference, but for long ones this is a win. 
Bug 696233.  Switch the nth-index cache to having a single hashtable per selector type (from end vs from start and of-type vs not-of-type).  Gives somewhat better cache locality on some workloads and makes entry addition much cheaper because we no longer need to initialize all the new memory when the hashtable store is resized; we just initialize the parts of it we need as we need them.  r=smaug

Bug 653881 - Rework XBL insertion points and clean up related code to more closely follow the Web Components model. Instead of maintaining a hashtable of insertion points in bindings (and removing insertions points from the tree) leave the insertion points in the tree as explicit placeholders and teach all other relevant code how to walk the explicit children of elements via two iterators (ExplicitChildIterator and FlattenedChildIterator). Note that this patch does not maintain 100% compatibility with the previous code: there are bug fixes and behavior changes included. For example, by having explicit insertion points in the bindings, it is now easier to handle dynamic changes to the bound element correctly (as well as, eventually, handling dynamic changes to the binding correctly).
