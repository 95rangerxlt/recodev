My changes to weave to enable cookie synchronization.  So far untested and still missing a thing or two. 
Merged my changes with the changes to async.js -- no conflicts. 
Merged changes and resolved conflicts between my cookie stuff and r282. 
Fixed a couple of syntax errors that were preventing weave from starting 
Fixed a couple of missing symbol exports that were stopping CookieEngine from being able to be instantiated. 
Fixed some minor errors in cookieStore / cookieSyncCore (still getting used to the getter idiom in javascript -- had too many underscores).  Syncing cookies now works in as much as it can upload all cookies to the server without raising any exceptions; now to see if it can download and merge cookies on the other side... 
Removed some lines that were only in there for debugging purposes. 
Updated the comment in CookieStore.editCommand. 
rethrow exception when applyCommands fails; merge changes from jono 
merge with jono's changes 
Fixed a todo in test_bookmark_sharing, still more left to do as jono's modifications to the bookmark sharing API change.
