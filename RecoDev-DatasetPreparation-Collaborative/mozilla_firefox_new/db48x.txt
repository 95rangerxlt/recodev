about:startup - record timestamp early on in the XRE setup 
about:startup - about page implemented as static html/js using the redirector, rather than an independant nsIAboutModule 
about:startup - PR_IntervalNow is kinda dumb. It makes no special attempt to be monotonic like the docs say, and additionally there's no way to equate it back to a real timestamp (which the docs do imply). Using PR_Now instead. 
about:startup - record a timestamp once session restore has finished, and display it and the duration between it and the app startup timestamp on the about:startup page 
about:config - implement nsXULAppInfo::GetLaunchTimestamp for linux 
about:startup - open the correct file, error check the fopen, use try/catch to check for failure in the js 
about:startup - merge with trunk 
about:startup - update to trunk 
about:startup - Windows implementation of nsXULAppInfo::GetLaunchTimestamp 
about:startup - fix about redirector mismerge 
about:startup - record results in database after startup has finished, and show the records in the about:startup page as a chart

about:startup - show the legend 
about:startup - hide empty message when the duration table isn't empty 
about:startup - small cleanup 
about:startup - take a stab at setting the colors of the graph 
about:startup - add the code that will display extension events as marks on the graph. also adds some boilerplate to make serializing async code easy again and uses it to serialize different queries to the database 
about:start - let the user toggle between graphs and tables, with graphs as the default 
use the correct query for the events table 
about:startup - hide the platform version/build fields from the duration table, because in Firefox the platform version changes only when the app version changes 
about:startup - propagate theme chages to the other themes 
about:startup - fix sql syntax error (oops) 
about:startup - remove mention of aboutStartup.css from faststripe 
about:startup - use nsAboutRedirector instead of the browser fork as it's more appropriate for a toolkit page

about:startup - remove some debug logging, and add some comments 
about:startup - handle application brand name and localizable extension names correctly

about:startup - some code style and api use changes, and more importantly wrapped the table creation in a transaction to save an fsync. feedback+=mak

change the id of a toolbarbutton. no bug, no review, just fiat. 
UI for editing keyboard shortcuts. Not yet actually editable, but updated to work with mfinkle's last patch. 
add in the correct code for translating a key into the proper string. the code is much the same as what nsMenuFrame does. It reuses the same properties files and so on. 
bug 441794: make the listbox an editable tree, and write some code for reading and setting prefs 
bug 441794: cache the keys to make setting up the UI O(n) rather than O(n^2) 
bug 441794: that's what I get for changing a variable name after testing but before checking in 
bug 441794: properly convert dom key events into keyspecs and thence to readable strings 
bug 441794: merge back to main line 
bug 441794: merge my other tree into the main line 
bug 441794: fix a mis-merged hunk, and some other miscellaneous tweaks 
move from using the test textbox to using the actual textbox in the editable tree, and properly round-trip the user's selections. 
bug 441794: address some comments by mfinkle, and also switch to using complex pref values so that non-ascii characters in the shortcuts round-trip correctly 
bug 441794: add a bunch of tests, and make a few tweaks so that they all pass. I still need to create the actual chrome mochitest, but all it'll have to do is call the test() function. 
bug 441794: add a couple more tests for completeness sake 
bug 441794: add support for clearing a shortcut, which relies on the patch in bug 446550. also fixes a couple of exceptions 
bug 441694: merge with trunk. also, hg add shortcuts.properties; I've somehow left it out since the beginning. 
bug 441794: fix a mis-merge, and also make a few tweaks to my code to match the shifting main ui.

bug 457781 — Plugin disabling in Addons Manager does not stick: only alter plugin state when the user has made a change, not on startup as well 
bug 457781 — Plugin disabling in Addons Manager does not stick: catch the first run of fennec and disable all plugins so that new users won't see the crashyness 
bug 457781 — Plugin disabling in Addons Manager does not stick: change the name of the (hopefully temporary) pref 
add a missing exclamation mark. r=vlad
