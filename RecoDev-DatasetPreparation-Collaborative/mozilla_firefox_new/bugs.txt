Add crashtests for some recently-WFM bugs 
Fix used before set ok bugs, fiddled ifdef style a bit. 
Fix dumb bugs I just committed, use JS_NOT_REACHED. 
1. Fix !JS_THREADED_INTERP bugs in BRANCH and recording switch case generation.
Fixed some explicit deallocation bugs that cropped up running in the browser. 
Fixed some bugs in the AMD64 port, still crash in 5 sunspider tests. 
Bugs 393629 and 436094. Fix document.all.length and make us honor the name attribute for the same set of elements as IE in the document.all implementation. r/sr=jst 
Generate an always taken LOOP_EXIT guard when an inner loop encounters a break statement. When returning from such an inner tree, make sure the recorder resumes at the target address of the goto the break was emitted as, otherwise the outer tree confuses the location with a break in its own loop. Disabled outerlining (this patch subsumes it, but we might enable it later since it might handle some cases more efficiently, currently off for debugging through). fasta currently asserts, and fannkuch hits a perf regression. These are probably bugs this change exposed. 
Added LIR_qior/pior.  Fixed more AMD64 page jumping bugs.  Fixed some other AMD64 usage bugs in jstracer. 
Bug 376662. Convert nsIFrame::GetOffsetTo to not use views. We need to ensure that for popups and scrollframes, views and frames are kept in sync at *all* times. Also fixes bugs in tests for NS_FRAME_NO_MOVE_FRAME. r+sr=bzbarsky

Fix some bugs 
Fix more bugs 
Tests for index updating when calling update on a cursor on an object store.  Also fixes some minor bugs preventing the tests from working correctly. 
bug 573382 - allow xpcnativewrappers to not fail-out in chrome manifest - commit on SeaMonkey 2.1a2 RELBRANCH ONLY to enable backwards compat for keeping DOM inspector working 
Add more awesome.  Still some bugs, will try to replace sync-engine.js next (with a more domain-specific version) - beginnings of that already in the code (unused) 
Fix some nasty bugs with the way js generators were being used.  Have the snapshot [de]serialized to the profile 
add a sync error event; make event names slightly more uniform; fix some resolver bugs 
Fixed bugs in cookieSyncCore.itemExists and cookieStore.addCommand.  The problem in addCommand was just a missing argument, but in itemExists I had to change the implementation to use cookieManager.enumerator rather than cookieManager.findMatchingCookie -- the latter function apparently does not exist in the nsICookieManager2 interface despite what MDC says about it. 
Fixed a couple minor bugs that were preventing bookmark engine from starting up properly 
Fixed a couple of minor bugs that were preventing bookmark share from starting (like, i was skipping enabled engines instead of disabled engines... duhh) 
Fixed some minor bugs -- the name of the incoming shared folder is parsed correctly, and xmppClient now catches bounce errors that were previously parsed as messages. 
catch 404s from initSession and do an initial upload; fix some bugs (missing yields, references to Engine properties) in RemoteStore.initialize 
Fixed a bug in the outstanding-callback-warning system and made Generator.throw() and Generator.cont() private methods because no client code was using them and it could introduce bugs in the system if they do; we can revisit making them public again later if we want. 
Fixed several minor bugs with bookmark sharing 
Fixed a whole bunch of bugs in bookmark share, mostly related to adding in needed JsonFilters for remote Resources and fixing the server paths which are passed into DAV for the keyring file and encrypted share data files.  (Also fixed a minor bug in DAV itself so that mkcol won't quit right away if you pass it something that starts with a slash.) 
Fixed a bunch of bugs in bookmark share: stuf related to server-side paths being incorrect (because the defaultPrefix in DAV was getting reset to an empty string or was getting applied wrong).  Discovered that updateOutgoingShare and updateIncomingShare were both calling the same _wrapMount() function, which was incorrect, so I broke that up and fixed what parts are meant to be outgoing and which incoming. 
Fixed some trivial bugs in BookmarkStore._wrapMountOutgoing that were preventing the outgoing share from working properly. 
sync only the last 150 history items (pending some special sauce to sync high-scoring items); various sql fixes.  history is syncing now, though there are bugs here and there

The solution is to keep the nsCSSValue::Image alive longer.  This patch adds two new types of nsAttrValue.  The first is an nsCSSValue::URL.  A ParseBackgroundAttribute method is added on nsGenericHTMLElement that the relevant elements (body/td/th/table/tr/tbody/thead/tfoot) call that parses background into an nsCSSValue::URL.  The second is an nsCSSValue::Image.  nsGenericHTMLElement::MapBackgroundInto attempts to convert the nsCSSValue::URL into an nsCSSValue::Image by kicking off the image load.  The result is that image loads are only started when the element is actually visible.  This also mirrors the way background-image works.  This also allows us to fix two longstanding bugs in this code.  Since MapBackgroundInto doesn't have a pointer to the actual element, it relied on grabbing the principal of the document.  Now we can grab the principal of the node in ParseBackgroundAttribute.  MapBackgroundInto also has no way to get at the element's base URI (to honor xml:base), which is now possible in ParseBackgroundAttribute.
