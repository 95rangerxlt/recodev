Fix BuildID typo 
Bug 235243: Need drag and drop feedback for toolbar bookmarks (and menuitem bookmarks for gtk2). In addition to the DND feedback, this patch: - introduces a new var 'BookmarksInsertion' that 'encapsulates' DND feedback display. - rewrite the rtl handling related to DND. BookmarksInsertion deals with this subtleties and the "public" feedback orientation ("before"|"on"|"after") returned by BookmarksInsertion.getOrientation refers now to the DOM. - paste and copy commands on the menus now insert after the rclicked element. The hack that appended everything at the end of the container has been removed or more accurately replaced by another one that is at least invisible to the user and we already used for DND. The problem is due a problem with the content building of containers with siblings (open in tabs stuff) not generated by the bookmarks template. - usual small glitch fixing.

See bugzilla bug 280725. Changes were made to the xremote mechanism to move it out of the os-specific widget code and into the more generic command line code in the toolkit. This bug implements the corresponding changes for the QNX Neutrino Mozilla based browser: 1) The xremote related code is removed from widget/src/photon/. 2) The nsPhMozRemoteHelper.* source files removed in step 1 are renamed to nsPhRemoteService.* and modified to work under toolkit/components/remote/. 3) Finally the photon specific code in widget/src/xremoteclient is modified so that the mozilla-xremote-client utility works as it did before. These changes are all Neutrino-only and should not affect any other platform, and in theory cannot bust any Tinderbox builds. p=407800 r=bsmedberg

Fix firefox, etc., (top-level mozilla) builds. 
Fix unstable trace rejection for optimized build. 
Add ExitFilter, which builds side exit typemaps for us. This had to be moved into a filter, because this has to happen after we eliminate redundant i2f-f2i chains as we can sink those into the side exit by simply storing the unpromoted/undemoted value and just flip the type in the exit map.

Build fixes: * enable RTTI by default when building with GCC to work around the tr1/functional error * link with -lrt * Tell chromium that it's always using wide wchar on Linux 
Some windows build fixup 
Windows build fixup. I haven't really tested whether tabs actually *work* in this scenario (widget sizing and parenting might be interesting), but it's at least enough to allow other people to start really working on code. 
Bug 463417 - import the nsinstall.exe source from CVS buildtools repository: make it capable of copying files with very long names, build it by default on Windows hosts, and stop using the moztools version, r?timeless

attempt to fix build bustage when using MSVC8. 
another stab at fixing MSVC8 build bustage. 
Link against dbghelp.lib on Windows to satisfy requirements of chromium/src/base/debug_util_win.cc (SymInitialize etc). This means the build requires Windows XP at runtime (or the user has to install the debugging tools for Windows, but I'm pretty sure we're ok with dropping Windows 2000 support). 
Make --disable-ipc work... mac-ppc now builds by default. 
add message logging, as far as is possible with current build setup; -fshort-char breaks it. reinstate async/sync message dispatchers. fix 64-bit int printf bug in chromium. 
windows build fix 
windows build fix, v2 
Disable using the static C++ runtime (on Windows-MSVC) because Chromium requires the full version and we're getting duplicate symbols. See bug 508861 which may be a necessary in order to get nightly builds running again (we actually need to ship the C++ runtime somewhere). 
build on 64-bit linux 
Package test.xul so that it ends up at chrome://global/content/test-ipc.xul. This allows it to be tested with nightly builds, as well as giving it chrome permissions so that jdm can work on hooking up typeaheadfind.

In a nonpackaged build, we have the following manifests:
* chrome.manifest is just a series of manifest directives for all the other manifests, generated in rules.mk using buildlist.py
** components/interfaces.manifest is also generated in rules.mk using buildlist.py
** Each chrome/jarfile.jar has a matching chrome/jarfile.manifest, and JarMaker.py inserts this filename into the root chrome.manifest by importing buildlist.py
In a packaged build, we end up with the following manifests:
When we repackage a l10n build, we only have to replace chrome/localized.manifest.

Bug 648997: Implement BlobBuilder spec as mozBlobBuilder. r=sicking.
Note that there is one key difference between this implementation and the spec.  In this patch mozBlobBuilder.getBlob("content/type"); returns a Blob and clears the mozBlobBuilder.  In the spec the BlobBuilder is not cleared.  Thus,
let bb = new mozBlobBuilder();
mozBlobBuilder.append("foo");
let blob1 = mozBlobBuilder.getBlob("content/type");
mozBlobBuilder.append("bar");
let blob2 = mozBlobBuilder.getBlob("content/type");
IMO, the spec behavior optimizes for the wrong case.  BlobBuilder will probably be used mostly as a one-shot API.  Additionally, the spec requires the BlobBuilder to hang on to potentially large amounts of memory between the getBlob() call and when the BlobBuilder is GCd.

Bug 860957 - Support for invoking non-recursive targets during partial tree builds; r=glandium 
Bug 848530 - Check for moz.build traversal at top of build; r=glandium
*any* moz.build file or Makefile.in is out of date. If so, config.status
is executed to rebuild the build backend.
Since we always perform this check as part of a build, we no longer need
special handling for out of date moz.build files during traversals. This
Another upside of the change is that if a moz.build file is modified
during building, we don't (potentially) modify the build backend from
under the in-progress build. Thus the only race condition that remains
is if a moz.build is mutated during moz.build reading. This window (a
few seconds) is significantly shorter than the time of a full build

Bug 897066 - In e10s builds, some pages should be loaded in the chrome process (r=gavin) 
If a document embeds an inline JSON dictionary, l10n.js translates the document right away without loading other l10n resources.  It usually works fine because our build system ensures the inline JSON dictionary contains all the necessary keys to handle the declarative content; but if an app adds some dynamic content to the document, when the user language is changed there might be some untranslated elements -- e.g. the "Add Contact" form in the Contacts app.

config/moz.build and js/src traversing them. With a single traversal of both
moz.build sets, we now only need to distinguish between js standalone builds
and gecko builds.

top-level instead of js/src in js standalone builds, or when choosing to make

Bug 1187094 - Part 2/2 - Fix non-unified build. r=efaust 
Bug 1189010. In ScrollFrameHelper::BuildDisplayList decide if we are building a scrollable layer before we call AppendScrollPartsTo because it needs this information. r=mstange
AppendScrollPartsTo finds or creates a scroll id for the current scroll frame if IsMaybeScrollingActive() is true (otherwise it uses the null scrollid). IsMaybeScrollingActive() looks at mShouldBuildScrollableLayer, which we compute after the first call to AppendScrollPartsTo in ScrollFrameHelper::BuildDisplayList.
This means that on the first paint with a displayport set (or even if we create a displayport is ScrollFrameHelper::BuildDisplayList) we wouldn't layerize the scroll thumb in nsSliderFrame::BuildDisplayListForChildren because it looks for the current scroll id set on the display list builder. On subsequent paints this would be corrected so it caused reftest failures.

For root scroll frames we need information about the async scrolling (or lack thereof) of the scroll frame before we get to ScrollFrameHelper::BuildDisplayList for the scroll frame.

There are now Buildbot jobs which can be triggered via the Buildbot Bridge.
Buildbot test jobs triggered by BBB builds do not receive the installer and test
In order to pass the installer and test urls to Buildbot test jobs triggered
via BBB (which run with --read-buildbot-configs) we have added functionality
to find these build artifacts by querying TaskCluster.
Up until last quarter this worked because the Buildbot Bridge uploaded a proprties.json
file for every task it created to mirror a Buildbot job (bug 1221091).
Since that is broken, I have found that we can generate a buildbot_properties.json
file and upload it. The current upload mechanism for Buildbot build jobs is that
determine when a Buildbot job is being driven by a task on TC (aka BBB) and tell
specifying 'parent_task_id' and getting to the buildbot_properties.json file uploaded
by the parent build job.
