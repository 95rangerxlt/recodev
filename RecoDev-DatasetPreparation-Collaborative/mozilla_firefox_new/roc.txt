Bug 421303 Crash [@ jsds_ScriptHookProc] r=caillon a=dsicore If we reach ~jsdService, that means our client doesn't care about us, so we can (and should) drop all references to any callbacks (if they cared, they'd have kept us alive!*). I think jsdService::Off should clear all the hooks, the strange magic of not clearing it isn't really a great idea. So for Off, we'll now clear the ScriptHook too (consumers who use off should really drop any references they have to our objects...). I'm still on the fence on this point, I suspect we can actually move it from ::Off to ~jsdService (it must be cleared at some point, otherwise if jsd_xpc's library manages to get unloaded, the function pointer would be invalid, which would be *BAD*). jsds_NotifyPendingDeadScripts needs to clear gDeadScripts whether or not there's a service or hooks, so it does. Because it's a static callback and because of the scary way GC works, I'd rather ensure (deathgrip) that jsds is available (and consistent!) for the duration of the function call. The code already handles the lack of a hook, so there's no reason to do magical returns.... The real problem which mayhemer found was that jsdService::Off was returning early (failure) because gGCStatus wasn't JSGC_END when called from ~jsdService from JS_GC from the cyclecollector, so we make sure that ~jsdService forces ::Off to act as if it is JSGC_END (after ensuring that there are no callbacks available). * a pure javascript (xpcom component, not DOM hosted!) version of a jsdService consumer means that jsdService will need to talk to the CycleCollector eventually (this is another bug for the future).

Changed AsyncException so that it dynamically subclasses the exception it's wrapping, and adds an 'asyncStack' property to allow access to the asynchronous call stack.  This, along with my previous few commits, makes the processing of stack traces in our code much more streamlined, and also allows our debugging output to be more informative, as stack information is now logged from the point at which an exception was thrown, rather than the point at which it was caught.

change engine to process (download, reconcile, apply changes) incoming records one by one 
* Streamline sync to be able to process incoming records one at a time, as soon as they are downloaded.  This changes reconciliation to be able to process a single incoming record.

Bug 488182 - Use an Iterator to grab both key and values from cleartext for processing bookmarks
SyncEngine__processIncoming: async/yield -> sync. 
WeaveSvc_processCommands: async + async/yield -> sync. 
Share a tagging code for create/update that will tag a dummy uri temporarily while it untags the bookmark to make sure every tag has at least one child during this untag/tag process. 
Incrementally process records as the collection finds record boundaries and converts them to records for the engine to use. Get rid of the collection iterator and original RecordParser. Add tests for incremental record parsing and remove old iter tests. 
Move _preprocess to before applyIncoming to share code for create/update/remove. 
Instrument all functions that are part of the sync engine (except some constructors, etc.) and generate statistics (min/max/sum/num/avg) for processing. For now with the default appender, implement toString to report just the total time. 
Fetch info/collections before syncing engines and set the lastModified property on the engine so that they can check if they need to process incoming. 
Update lastSync to the lastModified time from info/collections instead of updating times on each record. This is to prepare for fetching a list of GUIDs and processing a list of GUIDs. 
Only fetch a limited number of items on first/update syncs and if we get the same number, ask the server for the ids to fetch later. Also on every download, process some of the backlog and save the list of GUIDs to disk as json for cross-session support. 
Don't unconditionally forceGC on processIncoming especially when there's nothing to process. 
Limit the initial the first fetch of new items by a total number of fetch and subtract the number of items processed. Use the difference to keep fetching more items from the backlog in chunks. 
Use onBeforeDeleteURI to get the page's GUID and upload the delete record and process it by removing the page. 
Have wipeRemote wipe just the engines' data and make sure the clients process the command. 
Bug 536596 - Don't force garbage collections on every record processed
Wrap createRecord and encrypt incase an engine fails to create one or more of the records similar to how process incoming records are wrapped. 
Just sync a flat 50 instead of .1 of 1500 to avoid increasing slowdown when processing many items. 
* Hides the "start over" button on the sync options page when not running through the whole process.
Add two constants: WEAVE_CHANNEL and UPDATED_URL that get preprocessed with @xpi_type@. 
Reduce test run time (w/ coverage tool) from 25 minutes to 2 minutes while maintaining the same code coverage by processing hundreds instead of thousands of records.

Remove the MOZ_WIDGET_TOOLKIT backwards-compatibility definition in the reftest condition sandbox.  (Bug 570329)  r=roc 
Fix processing of matrix() transform functions to handle calc() rather than asserting.  (Bug 584569)  r=bzbarsky 
Fix assertion about float manager state by restoring old float manager state when we place a float and then cancel that placement.  (Bug 563584, patch 1)  r=roc 
Remove aForceFit/aRelaxHeightConstraint concept from float reflow, since we now split floats rather than push them to the next page (and correct propagation of nsHTMLReflowState::mFlags::mIsTopOfPage will force fitting when we need to).  (Bug 563584, patch 2)  r=roc 
Most of CanPlaceFloat is unnecessary given the float placement rules (in particular, that the top of a float cannot be higher than the top of any prior left or right float) and the fact that we now split floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 3)  r=roc 
Make nsBlockReflowState::FlowAndPlaceFloat reflow the float after computing its vertical position, so we know how much height is actually available.  (Bug 563584, patch 4)  r=roc
Replace force-fit with setting mIsTopOfPage correctly.  (Bug 563584, patch 5)  r=roc 
When we're in columns (and therefore not splitting floats), push floats that don't fit to the next column.  (Bug 563584, patch 6)  r=roc 
Use an AutoRestore to restore mY in nsBlockReflowState::FlowAndPlaceFloat.  (Bug 563584, patch 7)  r=roc 
Remove initialization to value that doesn't make much sense and never matters.  (Bug 563584, patch 8)  r=roc 
Allow the float manager to record that a float has been pushed past a break.  (Bug 563584, patch 9)  r=roc 
Add the optimization mentioned in the previous patch, so we don't have to iterate all floats to determine if one was split.  (Bug 563584, patch 10)  r=roc 
Don't try to clear pushed floats when computing the final size of blocks.  Fixes scrollbar on layout/reftests/bugs/563584-6-columns.html .  (Bug 563584, patch 11)  r=roc 
Make nsFrameList::RemoveFramesAfter(nsnull) remove the whole list.  (Bug 563584, patch 11.5)  r=roc 
Track which frames were float continuations that need to be pulled to the next block rather than figuring it out again when it's time to pull them.  (This allows first-in-flows to be float continuations.)  (Bug 563584, patch 12)  r=roc 
Manage float continuations to-be-pulled by the next-in-flow better by keeping them in a separate frame list until they're actually pulled.  (Bug 563584, patch 13)  r=roc 
nsBlockFrame::ReflowFloatContinuations doesn't need anything in AddFloat other than FlowAndPlaceFloat.  (Bug 563584, patch 14)  r=roc 
Steal float back before reflowing it, in order to allow first continuation of a float to be pushed to the next page.  (Bug 563584, patch 15)  r=roc 
Save float's next sibling since reflowing it could change the next sibling.  (Bug 563584, patch 16)  r=roc 
Don't propagate the float's reflow status through places that expect an inline's reflow status, to avoid the assertion for which bug 563584 was filed.  This separates pushing of floats from pushing of lines, and allows first-in-flow floats to be pushed to the next page without their associated line.  (Bug 563584, patch 17)  r=roc 
Do the same for PlaceBelowCurrentLineFloats:  don't propagate the truncation of a float into the line's reflow status.  (Bug 563584, patch 18)  r=roc 
Rename PushTruncatedPlaceholderLine since the remaining reasons for lines being truncated are related to being next to floats, not having truncated floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 19)  r=roc 
Remove aReflowStatus parameters made unnecessary by previous patch.  (Bug 563584, patch 20)  r=roc 
Add checks to VerifyList that previous siblings match next siblings.  (Bug 563584, patch 21)  r=roc 
Pass correct *remaining* height to float manager, rather than the whole height of the content area.  (Bug 563584, patch 22)  r=roc 
Adjust reftest assertion manifests for churn in nscoord_MAX-related assertions (which includes 'computed overflow area' assertion, because of width wraparound in UnionRect making overflow area empty).  (Bug 563584, patch 23)  r=roc 
Add bit to lines indicating that they may have a placeholder for a float that was pushed to the next line (and bump the child count up to 32 bits).  (Bug 563584, patch 24)  r=roc 
In a constrained height situation, we need to reflow anything with floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 25)  Fixes assertion on layout/generic/crashtests/408883-1.html .  r=roc 
Don't split floats when we're not paginating.  (Bug 563584, patch 26)  Fixes assertion on layout/generic/crashtests/461294-1.html .  r=roc 
Add comment describing mIsTopOfPage better.  (Bug 563584, patch 28)  r=roc 
Don't switch a constrained height to an unconstrained one due to infinite clearance.  Fixes layout/reftests/bugs/563584-10b.html .  (Bug 563584, patch 29)  r=roc 
Set incomplete status when we have continuations that we shouldn't destroy.  Fixes assertion on layout/generic/crashtests/469859-1.xhtml .  (Bug 563584, patch 30)  r=roc 
Add reftests for bug 563584.  (Bug 563584, patch 31)  r=roc 
Don't force availableHeight to be nonnegative, because doing so means that we'll place zero height blocks (including their non-zero-height contents) at the bottom of a page when there's not room (see nsHTMLReflowState::SetTruncated).  (Bug 563584, patch 32)  r=roc 
Rename float continuations to pushed floats.  (Bug 563584, patch 33)  r=roc

Now that overflow areas are split, change nsIFrame::ComputeTightBounds to use visual overflow.  While it really only needs to include frame bounds, glyph bounds, and text decorations, since glyph bounds are not part of scrollable overflow, it must use visual overflow.

Add a mParagraphDepth member to BidiParagraphData and cache it on frames to track nested bidi-isolated paragraphs. Use mParagraphDepth (* 2 + isRTL in order to keep LTR even and RTL odd) as the initial paragraph embedding level instead of pushing a stack of embedding codes. Pass the <bdi> frame instead of its first-child to BidiParagraphData::Reset and save a call to GetParent(). Split inline ancestors before and after bidi-isolated paragraphs, in the same way that we currently do between runs in different directions. This required also adding code to SplitInlineAncestors to handle situations where the parent frame is being split before its first child or after its last child. In JoinInlineAncestors, prevent frames that belong to paragraphs isolated from one another from being rejoined. Bug 712600, r=ehsan, roc

I also modified Tab{Parent,Child} and nsFrameLoader to call "app" "ownOrContainingApp", to emphasize that we might have inherited the app from a parent process.

There's a related, functional bug also fixed here, which is that a browser process doesn't inherit its parent's app-id.  This causes problems e.g. for IndexedDB: If a browser inside an app uses IndexedDB, the DB should have the app's app-id.
I also modified Tab{Parent,Child} and nsFrameLoader to call "app" "ownOrContainingApp", to emphasize that we might have inherited the app from a parent process.  I left nsIDocShell::appId alone, because changing that would have necessitated changing nsILoadGroup and therefore a /lot/ of users in Necko; it's also not clear it would have clarified anything in those cases.

2) If a process crashed while holding a wake lock on topic X, and if no other process held a wake lock on that topic, and there were no wake lock listeners registered, we wouldn't remove X from our hashtable of wake lock topics.

Bug 771765 - Support template content process, part 1: the Nuwa API and low-level wrappers. r=khuey
Support of zygote-like process forking is done as:
* The b2g chrome process forks a child process that will be the template for forking other content processes.
* The template process starts running to some point and freeze.
* When ready, the chrome process starts requesting the template to fork content proceses.
* The content processes forked from the template process recovers its states including the threads, file descriptors for epoll, signaling and IPC.
Recovery of the process states are done by wrapping some system and pthread calls to record the states in the template process and recover in the forked content process. 
Bug 771765 - Support template content process, part 2: IPC and glue changes. r=bent

Changes initialization code for the template process:
* Let the process run for NUWA_PREPARATION_TIME ms and then start freezing the threads.
* Delay android binder thread pool creation after the content process is forked from the template and other thread recreation has finished.
* Poke the app shell after the content process is forked from the template. 
Bug 771765 - Support template content process, part 9: allocating a toplevel protocol should return itself. r=dzbarsky

Bug 933093 - Part 2: Add 'sendFile' implementation to Chrome process. r=yoshi
The chrome process is the arbitrator / mediator between the content process that issued the nfc 'sendFile' operation and the system-process (content) that is responsible for performing handover to an alternate carrier(AC).
The chrome process notifies the system process through a 'nfc-manager-send-file' system-message to initiate the handover process.
The system-process subsequently handovers the data to alternate carrier's (AC's : BT / WiFi) 'sendFile' interface. 
This message is notified to system-process to initiate Bluetooth's send file operation.

Bug 1059662 - Disallow OOP app to embed in-proc apps. r=fabrice
Modern OSs adjust process scheduling based on CPU-boundedness and Interface-boundedness.  A process performing a lot of UI tasks requires lower-latency than a CPU-bound process.  For this reason, at least on Windows (but probably also Linux and Mac), in e10s, resize events are sent at a much higher rate than non-e10s, where the main process has to do the work to respond to them.  This was supposed to be handled by the 'compress' option in IPDL but its duplicate-event test was very imprecise - it only tested the *oldest* message in the queue.  This patch searches the messagequeue/deque to remove *any* duplicate.  deque::erase is linear but this is a very uncommon case - currently only two compressed IPDL messages exist in the entire code base.  Also, these queues are small.

ProcessPendingRestyles.  (Rebuilding all style data is what we do when
the restyle processing in each restyle processing operation.  In other
words, the goal is to change the rebuild-all process from a separate
codepath to a few variables that modify the way ProcessPendingRestyles

Bug 1161072 - Wait for all async operations to finish before proceeding in browser_tilt_picking_inspector.js. r=bgrins 
1. Our concept of recursion depth is broken for things that run from AfterProcessNextEvent observers (e.g. Promises). We decrement the recursionDepth counter before firing observers, so a Promise callback running at the lowest event loop depth has a recursion depth of 0 (whereas a regular nsIRunnable would be 1). This is a problem because it's impossible to distinguish a Promise running after a sync XHR's onreadystatechange handler from a top-level event (since the former runs with depth 2 - 1 = 1, and the latter runs with just 1).

When workers shut down we discard the event queue rather than running it to completion.  Originally workers managed their event queue themselves and would simply iterate through the array of events and cancel them all.  After bug 914762 this was done by setting a (thread-)global "canceling" flag and then calling NS_ProcessPendingEvents.  But this neglects that a shut down request can be received while the worker is in a sync queue.  In this case, calling NS_ProcessPendingEvents will process any events pending in the sync queue, which is *not* the queue we need to cancel.
The fix is, if we are in a sync queue when NotifyInternal is called, to defer clearing the queue until the top-most sync queue is destroyed and we are about to return to the regular event queue.  Only then can we call NS_ProcessPendingEvents to clear out the queue.  Because we can never process any events from this queue while sync queues are active, the timing of the mass cancellation is unchanged from the perspective of events in the regular queue.

TakeFocus() ends up making sync calls to the parent process. That means if we
try to call it from a sync call to the child process we end up deadlocked.  The
easiest way to fix this is to make the message to the child process async.
