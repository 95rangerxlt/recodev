Lots of changes and bugfixes: - Enable multiple username support by listening to change events for the username field when there is more than one stored login for the form. - Make the signon hashtable store a SignonHashEntry, which has a pointer to the first SignonDataEntry.  This lets us adjust the head of the linked list without a hashtable operation, and also fixes a case where we would continue using a deleted entry, leading to a crash.- Change FindPasswordEntryFromSignonData to FnidPasswordEntryInternal, and refactor it a bit.- Clean up prefill logic so that multiple forms on a page could be prefilled.- Fix bug where the last input was used as the username field, instead of the input just before the password.- Make sure we write out all entries for each realm.- Make sure we include all entries in each realm when returning an enumerator.- Remove some form manager cruft I missed in passwordManager.js.

Bug 235243: Need drag and drop feedback for toolbar bookmarks (and menuitem bookmarks for gtk2). In addition to the DND feedback, this patch: - introduces a new var 'BookmarksInsertion' that 'encapsulates' DND feedback display. - rewrite the rtl handling related to DND. BookmarksInsertion deals with this subtleties and the "public" feedback orientation ("before"|"on"|"after") returned by BookmarksInsertion.getOrientation refers now to the DOM. - paste and copy commands on the menus now insert after the rclicked element. The hack that appended everything at the end of the container has been removed or more accurately replaced by another one that is at least invisible to the user and we already used for DND. The problem is due a problem with the content building of containers with siblings (open in tabs stuff) not generated by the bookmarks template. - usual small glitch fixing.

See bugzilla bug 280725. Changes were made to the xremote mechanism to move it out of the os-specific widget code and into the more generic command line code in the toolkit. This bug implements the corresponding changes for the QNX Neutrino Mozilla based browser: 1) The xremote related code is removed from widget/src/photon/. 2) The nsPhMozRemoteHelper.* source files removed in step 1 are renamed to nsPhRemoteService.* and modified to work under toolkit/components/remote/. 3) Finally the photon specific code in widget/src/xremoteclient is modified so that the mozilla-xremote-client utility works as it did before. These changes are all Neutrino-only and should not affect any other platform, and in theory cannot bust any Tinderbox builds. p=407800 r=bsmedberg

Instead of avoiding Cleanup(), make it be harmless by nulling out the pointer to the buffer. 
Bustage fix. Lines counts for the output files incremented to account for extra lines added by bug 396316.

Bug 421303 Crash [@ jsds_ScriptHookProc] r=caillon a=dsicore If we reach ~jsdService, that means our client doesn't care about us, so we can (and should) drop all references to any callbacks (if they cared, they'd have kept us alive!*). I think jsdService::Off should clear all the hooks, the strange magic of not clearing it isn't really a great idea. So for Off, we'll now clear the ScriptHook too (consumers who use off should really drop any references they have to our objects...). I'm still on the fence on this point, I suspect we can actually move it from ::Off to ~jsdService (it must be cleared at some point, otherwise if jsd_xpc's library manages to get unloaded, the function pointer would be invalid, which would be *BAD*). jsds_NotifyPendingDeadScripts needs to clear gDeadScripts whether or not there's a service or hooks, so it does. Because it's a static callback and because of the scary way GC works, I'd rather ensure (deathgrip) that jsds is available (and consistent!) for the duration of the function call. The code already handles the lack of a hook, so there's no reason to do magical returns.... The real problem which mayhemer found was that jsdService::Off was returning early (failure) because gGCStatus wasn't JSGC_END when called from ~jsdService from JS_GC from the cyclecollector, so we make sure that ~jsdService forces ::Off to act as if it is JSGC_END (after ensuring that there are no callbacks available). * a pure javascript (xpcom component, not DOM hosted!) version of a jsdService consumer means that jsdService will need to talk to the CycleCollector eventually (this is another bug for the future).

Enable tracing for selected opcodes that do not have any remaining tracing hazards. 
Add a per-runtime loop attribute table that associates a jsval attribute with every loop in the code. The jsval is used initially as a counter until a certain threshold is reached, at which point the loop is traced and compiled and the resulting native code object is stored in the jsval to be executed for future encounters of the loop. 
JSOP_HEADER takes a byte index of loop header counting from script->loopBase, and related changes. 
Added tag tested for changeset d1a7596d7887 
Landed nanojit in TraceMonkey. This is untested and DEBUG must be off for now since we don't support AVM's String class. 
Properly align pages allocated by GCHeap. 
Back out explicit zeroing in the constructor and ensure heap allocated objects are implicitly zero-ed out. 
Drop JS prefix from classes related to traceing. 
Throw out a bunch of primitives (guards) that we are no longer interested in. 
Fix native frame addressing (reported by vlad.) 
This patch eliminates ValueToECMAInt32 and instead tries to emit specialized code depending on the true type. 32-bit integers are detected and treated like integers in fetch_int via ValueToECMA32. Similarly, int store_int NewIntInRootedValue is used if the value is really an underlying int. NewIntInRootedValue is a nop on the trace. 
Indicated in a separate primitive when integers get stored as a double because they don't into a jsval. 
Fix unnecessary type prefix (reported by bc, doesn't pass gcc 4.2.3) 
Create a stub for each opcode in TraceRecorder and invoke them from the stubs that are pointed to by the recorder dispatch-table. 
Make trace-code 32-bit clean and extend interpreter state to carry the current context (cx). The recorder still has to record a 31-bit int path through the loop, but the emitted code is able to stay in the tree even if values bump over to 32-bit ints. 
Beginning of SETELEM/GETELEM tracing for dense arrays.  Needs computed-offset
Fix dumb bugs I just committed, use JS_NOT_REACHED. 
Added support for semi-stable loop variables. Compiling for(...) q += 2.5; is ridiculously difficult because it flip-flops between int and double. Add support to promote integer values to doubles at the loop tail if at loop entry we expect a double. Since this isn't possible the other way around, we have to get luck that we catch a path into the loop where q is already double. For this we add 3 trigger points (10, 13, 37). We will try three times to record a trace at those iteration counts of a loop. If none succeed the loop is blacklisted. This probably needs more tuning down the road. 
Add ExitFilter, which builds side exit typemaps for us. This had to be moved into a filter, because this has to happen after we eliminate redundant i2f-f2i chains as we can sink those into the side exit by simply storing the unpromoted/undemoted value and just flip the type in the exit map. 
Since numbers are now always represented by doubles at the recorder/type level, using BoxDouble and UnboxDouble only when moving numbers from or to memory. A filter will then turn f2i(UnboxDouble) into UnboxInt where appropriate. 
Strength reduce BoxDouble(i2f(x)) to BoxInt32(x). Make sure loop indexes are actually integers. This guard will be eliminated further down in the pipeline if we decided to peel the type of the loop variable (index) down to integer. 
remove outdated guard (now inferred via filter as needed) 
Sink type conversions into the side exit by updating the map and seeing though the cast in the store (in ExitFilter). Add a whole bunch of asserts on the varios speculative type states to make sure we get the state machine right. Import speculated integer values as integers into the trace (indicate in entry map). 
Demote floating point comparisons even if one side is constant (bug in nanojit, filed as #443884 against tamarin). Also demote add/sub/mul using the integer overflow detection side exit code that Ed adopted upstream. Tight loops (bitwise) are not emitted completely as integer code after the initial compilation using doubles triggered a speculative demotion of the context slots. 
Add support to demote stores of constants that are currently represented as float but are really integers. bitwise.js is now compiled complete fp-casts free. 
ngvars and the slot index are not related, so don't rely on ngvars < JS_INITIAL_NSLOTS to decide whether dslots exists 
root converted argv[0] 
sp_adj is now maintained in bytes, not words, so +8 is now the magic value to point to the top of the stack. All stores above that watermark are eliminated by StackFilter in nanojit. 
Stricter typing of the tracker code path which now only accepts jsval as suggested by Brendan. 
Assert if no gvar is allocated for an undeclared global. 
disable tracer for platforms not supported by nanojit 
Demote fneg to neg if input is known to be an integer (untested). 
Aliasing cleanup for LIR.h. Patch submitted for upstream review. 
fix scalpel left in nativeFrameSlots from aborted thisp addition to frame 
Enable inlining for calls. Deep bailouts (from within side exits) are generated but are not allowed to be ever taken (for now). 
Notify the recorder when a new frame was created by JSOP_CALL. 
Improve js_IsLoopExit (unannotated JSOP_GOTO is still ambiguous). 
merge (now compiling, untested) 
Lazy fill the stackTracker as we lookup the nativeFrameOffset for values. Purge all entries related to the current frame when it is popped. This code could be further simplified if Tracker was a template. 
Add a fast path for nativeFrameOffset that walks entire groups at a time, not slots. Check against the result calculated by the FORALL macro in DEBUG builds (for sanity). 
This will allow nested loops to access the globals interned by outer loops while at the same time sharing parts of the stack of the outer loop. 
Print real recording point, not entryRegs and add an assert that makes sure the guard we come out of is associated with the tree we entered into. 
Pass null instead of &val is no result is wanted by EvaluateString's caller. 
Smarter speculative demotion of numbers to integers and promotion of the trace seems to require actual doubles. If the number at entry looks like an int we make the slot an int and compile as such. If the loop-tail proves the slot to be a double, we recompile the trace. Currently such miss-speculation cannot be handled on secondary traces since we are currently unable to recompile the primary trace. Such secondary traces are blacklisted. 
Add limited outerlining. Much of this will be subsumed by nested trees. 
Switch from one global frame to another by walking the two sorted gslots lists. 
Remove global frame transition code. Obsoleted by the new on-demand global loading code which we are about to add. 
Fixed some MSVC whinings, implemented rdtsc on win32 
Trash entire tree with all the information associated with it when we have a typemap conflict or the global shape changes. 
Major shakeup of the interning code for globals. Globals are now detected on demand as they are used and the slots are noted in treeInfo->globalSlots. At the same time the type is recorded in treeInfo->globalTypeMap. The stack type-map is maintained separately in treeInfo->stackTypeMap. All these structures are lists and are maintained as List<T> objects. Imports for globals can appear at the top (if we have already seen some imports for the loop header and are recompiling), or on the fly for lazily found values. We no longer intern all global properties that happen to match a name in the current function, and we also support inlining of functions that touch globals that are not used in the method where the trace started in. 
Make guard return expected, so we can trace alternate cases easily.
- Fix import to take the localFrame from whose fun its localNames parameter was computed -- it was using cx->fp which is wrong when FORALL_SLOTS_IN_PENDING_FRAMES iterates other than the top of stack frame.
Fix ifop null/object inverted logic sense bug. 
Backed out changeset 8421b003fb5f -- it broke string to number, demonstrated by running trace-test.js without the -j (jit) option (10 - "1.3" => NaN instead of 8.7).
Pull recompile flag out of the state and pass in as argument. Trash the tree if a secondary trace can't be connected to the loop header. This is very aggressive and might need more tinkering. Trashing the tree on every mismatch doesn't seem to work well, so thats currently disabled. 
Recognize loop edges that hit a nested tree. 
When merging globals from inner trees to outer trees, make sure to push the expected type upstream as well. 
We don't deallocate JIT-related data structures when the JIT is shut down. Add a TODO for this. 
Get operator new on interpreted functions working, along with JSOP_SETPROP on an unmutated object, or one of the right shape but where the setprop is adding the next property, and it's not in the object yet. 
Remove ip from InterpState. Calculate the new pc after a trace side exit relative to lr->from->root->ip, which also works if we side exit on a different tree than we entered (which can happen in case of nested trees.) 
Support calling of nested tree from within inlined frames. When we call a tree that tree expects to be the top-level tree, which means it assumes callDepth=0. If the call of the tree is within an inlined frame, thats not true (callDepth > 0). We adjust the native stack pointer accordingly before calling the tree, and then restore the value of the stack pointer after the call. Fancy stuff. 
Add an assert to protect against nested exits (not implemented yet.) 
Reoptimize call and new based on shape guards and branded method-ful scopes -- no need to emit function-is-interpreted guards. 
Fragmento lifetime is now associated with the thread/runtime instead of the context. 
Put trailing args on their own lines when they otherwise would seem to associate with a nested call in a previous arg position. 
js_obj_hasOwnProperty is supposed to return a boolean but was incorrectly generating code to return a number, resulting on a failure in the boolean comparison due to an unexpected i2f (450304). 
- Add CallGetter built-in and use it for regexp class-getter-implemented prototype properties.
Hands down the hardest bug I had to debug in TM so far. Make sure to read back any registers an inner tree might have changed before writing out the typemap for the nested_exit guard, otherwise we might be pointing to old stale pre-(inner-)loop state and pick an incorrect (in this case too narrow) type. fannkuch=2.8x with this. 
Don't cache loads in import into the nativeFrameTracker, since when coming back from a nested tree we re-load the frame state into registers using import() based on the called tree's state, which pushes loads into the nativeFrameTracker that are relative to the inner tree's call depth. Only cache on writes now, which should be always safe. 
Read back registers used by inner tree relative to inner_sp (the adjusted sp value). Print frames we enter into and return to in Enter/LeaveFrame. 
Add nestedExit to InterpState and comment its fields. 
Implement nested side exits. 
Added test case for nested exits. 
Update inlineCallCount with the total call stack height, which is the sum of rp_adj and any adjustments nested trees added. Also make sure to read all stack adjustment information from the tree we exit on, not the tree we entered (might be different in case of nesting.) 
FlushNativeStackFrame currently only handles the innermost nested trees writeback, so at least make it use the proper adjusted stack base for that. 
Restore state of the outer frames in case of a nested exit. Should be feature complete but needs more debugging. 
Added bitsinbyte-ish testcase to trace-test.js. This currently still crashes the VM in nested mode. 
Fixed the known native arg handler from accidentally using 'continue' to break out of a loop one level higher.  This was causing crashes when the arg didn't match the expected types (bug 450530). 
Make sure sp points to the native stack base of the inner tree when calling a nested tree. 
Enable nested trees by default. This is going to be exciting. 
Change interface of js_ExecuteTree to indicate which of the peer fragments it really executed (since we soon will have more than one tree that could be activated for that particular bytecode location). 
Try to execute the tree first, and if that fails worry about counting and triggering compilation. This speeds up trace activiation by a tiny bit, but makes code that we can't trace a little bit slower. We use a micro optimization to bypass the call to js_ExecuteTree when its clear that it wouldn't find a tree to executed to reduce this overhead. This change is necessary for multiple trees per bytecode location. 
Add a method to type map that captures missing slots (which have been lazily added to the slot list since the type map was created.) 
Updated nanojit for the AMD64 patch. 
1. Fix json2.js (it crashes later, another bug) to restore a non-empty stack for a call with missing args after a nested bail-out. This involves changing js_SynthesizeFrame to return the number of stack slots it reconstructed that map to native slots. It also means not counting the missing args in the spdist uint16 pushed onto the state.rp stack (this was the root of all over-counting evil, for this bug).
Intern globals per-context, not per tree, which allows transitioning between trees that use globals. The type of all global slots compiled code uses is expected to remain stable, otherwise the entire code cache has to be flushed. Changes to the shape of the global object also flush the code cache. Working for trace-tests.js, but fails math-partial-sum.js 
AMD64 trace-tests.js passes now (hacked in LIR_qcmov opcode, corrected builtin return types). 
Push actual guard that failed in a nested call, not the expected. 
Restore state.sp and state.rp before the nested guard exit point so we can have a sequence of them and still have rp/sp adjusted correctly. 
Support multiple returns from called trees by continueing the outer tree with a new nested guard. 
Remove bogus fadd +1 check at the end of the loop. We have long switched over to starting slots as int and hence n++ will be emitted as integer add with i2f, so checking for i2f only is sufficient. 
Remove lambda-replace built-in, it's not safe to record into a nested js_Interpret. 
Upvar, v0.1 (limited to looking up from eval in a function, to the function's args and vars). 
JSThread is not zeroed when allocated, grrr.

Enable outlining. If a loop doesn't connect back to its own header (i.e. break inside the loop), see if the outer loop path can be attached to the inner loop (outerlining). Added test case (failure mode is high number of activated traces in trace-test.js). This test exposes a regression in access-fannkuch. Committing so we can diagnose that separately.

Add test of (attempted) trace recording with an active call object 
Generate an always taken LOOP_EXIT guard when an inner loop encounters a break statement. When returning from such an inner tree, make sure the recorder resumes at the target address of the goto the break was emitted as, otherwise the outer tree confuses the location with a break in its own loop. Disabled outerlining (this patch subsumes it, but we might enable it later since it might handle some cases more efficiently, currently off for debugging through). fasta currently asserts, and fannkuch hits a perf regression. These are probably bugs this change exposed. 
Rename gcDontBlock to runningJittedCode, and assert it's false on entry to js_Interpret (for 451657, but not the fix, just prolog). 
When extending an outer tree from its nesting guard, the guard we actually exited on determines the typemap for the current frame and all inlined frames, whereas the nesting guard is consulted for all type information frames below the current frame. 
Add test case for decaying inner loops that sometimes are not executed at all since the condition fails pre-entry. 
Fix a bug Jesse reported: insufficient copy/paste from record_JSOP_CALL to record_JSOP_NEW. 
If the inner tree cannot be adjusted to match the call site of the outer tree because it uses an int where the outer tree uses a double, trash the inner tree, not the outer one. In CallTree, return the innermost guard we return from, not the outermost one. Jump over at most 1 loop edge that doesn't go back to our own header, not an arbitrary amount.

The goal is to avoid the synchronous repaint required by bitblitting (synchronicity is required to minimize the delay between blitting and repainting --- the intermediate display is very ugly). Also, make scroll-induced full-view repainting DEFERRED, so that it's less urgent and more apt to coalesce, so we drop frames more easily when painting can't keep up during scrolling. r+sr=bz

Create a new method FixInvalidFrecencies that finds invalid (negative) frecencies and recalculates them. Use it for handling creating/migrating DBs as well as recalculating invalid places on daily idle (place frecencies are already estimated by decay).

The test uses mork history with a number of pages that now all get their frecencies calculated on migrate, where before this fix, the test fails with a bunch of pages still with negative frecencies.

To this end, the classes nsPluginStreamInfo and nsPluginStreamListenerPeer have been unified: the nsNPAPIPluginStreamListener holds the stream listener peer alive so that additional range requests can be made on it. In addition the nsNPAPIPluginStreamListener holds *itself* alive for NP_SEEK streams, and only calls releases itself/calls CleanUpStream when the plugin explicitly calls NPN_DestroyStream or when the associated plugin instance is being destroyed. r=josh

My changes to weave to enable cookie synchronization.  So far untested and still missing a thing or two. 
Fixed a couple of missing symbol exports that were stopping CookieEngine from being able to be instantiated. 
Updated the comment in CookieStore.editCommand. 
Removed comment from load-weave.js that I put in while debugging and committed by accident. 
add a c++ crypto component, ported from bug 400742; with a specialized makefile to build in the extension (with the gecko sdk) 
Implemented cookieStore.editCommand(). 
First commit of my XMPP client, as demonstrated at the meeting today, to weave/modules.  This does not include the test-synchronization stuff.  xmppClient.js is the main client class; transportLayer.js and sasl.js (which does authentication) are the helper classes. 
Expanded test_xmpp -- currently failing tests but it's got the setup now for timing out and failing if the expected message is not received. 
Created a readme for using the XMPP client module. 
Created some documentation of how to add synchronization functionality for a new user data type to Weave.  Created a new directory called docs to put this into. 
Created a cookie tracker in trackers.js, and a test for it in tests/unit/test_cookie_store.js. 
Made the bookmark-share dialog box display the name of the folder you selected; also, the 'Share This Folder' menu text is now pulled from share.properties for easier i18n. 
Moved all code related to the syncing of cookies--e.g. CookieStore, CookieTracker, CookieEngine, CookieSyncCore--into their own file at modules/engines/cookies.js.  I'll be doing the same to the other engines shortly.
Re-removed cookie-related changes that were accidentally re-added by c1a58b24679c and/or 5a49daf87c94.
Moved all history-related functionality into modules/engines/history.js. 
imported patch xmpp-transport-fault-tolerance-and-test 
Re-disabled test_xmpp_simple.js; it shouldn't be run without a local jabber server (and it wasn't, until I accidentally comitted my local change enabling the test.

Async.Generator	DEBUG	 runTestGenerator-0: self.cb generated at test_async_missing_yield.js:28
Async.Generator	DEBUG	 secondGen-1: self.cb generated at test_async_missing_yield.js:20
async.js now keeps track of how many outstanding callbacks it has and uses this information to log warnings about coroutines that may have yielded without an outstanding callback, and coroutines that may have finished while a callback is still outstanding.  These are merely 'warnings' rather than certainties because this code assumes that there is a 1:1 correspondence between accesses to self.cb and yields, and also that self.cb's are actually passed to asynchronous functions.  It'd be really cool if we could actually keep track of whether a callback got garbage collected before it was called or something, though I don't know how much it'd help in the end.

The manage.py test-runner now compares expected results to actual results if a '<test-name>.log.expected' file exists in the test directory; if they don't match, a unified diff is displayed.  Note that this is only done via manage.py, it's not currently implemented in the Makefile test framework because makefiles make me barf.

Updated a couple of comments in bookmark sharing 
Fixed a whole bunch of bugs in bookmark share, mostly related to adding in needed JsonFilters for remote Resources and fixing the server paths which are passed into DAV for the keyring file and encrypted share data files.  (Also fixed a minor bug in DAV itself so that mkcol won't quit right away if you pass it something that starts with a slash.) 
Fixed a bunch of bugs in bookmark share: stuf related to server-side paths being incorrect (because the defaultPrefix in DAV was getting reset to an empty string or was getting applied wrong).  Discovered that updateOutgoingShare and updateIncomingShare were both calling the same _wrapMount() function, which was incorrect, so I broke that up and fixed what parts are meant to be outgoing and which incoming. 
Factored the sending of xmpp notifications in bookmarkSharingManager out into a separate function, to save some duplicated code and make it easier to break xmpp stuff into a separate class later.  Also made the bookmarkSharingManager cache the current weave username, which it uses a lot.  Finally it now prepends /user/this._myUsername/ to server URLs to make them into absolute paths before sending them to the sharing partner over xmpp, which fixes a leftover TODO from a copule days ago. 
A new preference called "waitOnQuit.enabled" was created. This preference controls whether Weave will perform any actions on quit. If false, Weave won't perform any actions on quit, nor wait for any running actions. If true, Weave will wait for any running sync to finish.
The old "syncOnQuit.enabled" preference now controls if Weave will actually perform a full sync on quit or not. If false, no sync is started, but we still wait for an active sync to finish, if waitOnQuit.enable is true.
Made wrapping of outgoing shares not crash if an outgoing share is missing an exptected annotation.

add clients sync (list of clients with names and types); make it simpler to create Engine subclasses; remove the 2nd 'authenticator' parameter for Resources; resetServer is now wipeServer; consider 0 an invalid place ID (fixes bug when calculating item depths); add a Svc global exported from utils.js where commonly used services can live

Have engines check if the deleted flag is the same for _isEqual. 
switch from autogenerated load-module tests to a single test that loads all modules 
Remove some async related code in head.js. 
Use a shared setGUID for new items and changing guids so that the item always ends up with the GUID (because conflicts shouldn't have been Weave generated). 
For items that have the correct parent, see if there's an item following it and reposition the chain of items to after the correct parented item. A chain of followers starts at the item with the predecessor annotation and goes until the end of the folder, an item that is looking for a predecessor, or ends up at where we started (the predecessor). 
Attach followers for both created items and updated items (call from applyIncoming) when it's under the right parent. Share logic for attaching followers when creating a folder then fixing the reparented children and when creating/updating an item in the right parent. 
Handle holes in bookmark folders and fix up bookmarks to be at an earlier position if a hole was detected. 
Remove unused cancelRequested code that causes JS strict warnings. 
Remove the Wizard Dialog, Account Pane, Login Dialog, Add-ons Pane, Advanced Dialog and their related xul/js/css/strings/images. Clean up some unused functions, xul:preferences, css, strings. Orphaned functionality: autoconnect preference, reset/forgot password/passphrase. 
Switch to newline mode when using a collection record handler, and look for newlines! Easy! Update test to provide newline-separated strings instead of JSON. 
Remove unimplemented engines so they do not initialize. 
Don't aggressively persist the password with smart (dumb?) setters that clear out the temp password; and provide a separate function to persist the login. This effectively makes setting password/passphrase always temporary until persisted, which will check if the value is different from the one already stored on disk. A number of verify/cluster functions are privitized to not need to take user/pass/passph as arguments so that the default authenticator will work, and verifyPassphrase will use the stored passphrase to correctly handle auto-login. 
Always allow getting an object representation of potentially JSON response for any Resource instead of explicitly on filterDownload. Update existing Resource GETs that manually parse the response. This prevents the String response from accidentally toString()ing a filteredDownload that converted to a different type. 
Convert uses of recordLike/findLikeId to findDupe except Bookmarks is unimplemented. 
Only fetch a limited number of items on first/update syncs and if we get the same number, ask the server for the ids to fetch later. Also on every download, process some of the backlog and save the list of GUIDs to disk as json for cross-session support. 
Get rid of the ugly EXPORTED_SYMBOLS array of strings for constants and generate it from a constants hash that sets the value and provides the exported name. Remove some unused constants and line-up the values at 40th column. 
Rework server/user/misc prefs to allow relative paths and full urls for generating API paths. Cache string properties of generated URLs under the storageAPI instead of using dynamic getters. 
Report 404 info/collections responses as "login rejected" if we're on the right cluster. 
Move the status record into a separate Status object exported with the Weave object. 
Keep the unsorted bookmark folder unsorted and not worry about the ordering. 
Update predecessor test to additionally test unsorted bookmark predecessors. 
Remove bits related to authenticator/auto-login and openid (munge and redirect). 
Just open the file as a tab to show the activity log. Remove related xul/js/strings. Saving can be done through normal Save Page As... No manual cleaning of the log, but the size is much smaller. 
Remove unwanted info logging for bookmark indices. 
Store the reason for starting fresh (new syncId) in meta/global and fail remoteSetup on certain reasons to let the UI show a notification to the user for a response (pick merge or change passphrase). Code paths (sync, prep, etc.) related to remote commands are removed. 
Bug 528090 - When logging out, stay disconnected until told to connect
bug 527517 - replace Connected As with Current User to remove ambiguity 
Always update the lastModified time to avoid tabs only sometimes getting updated. 
Bug 533580 -  strip busted tbird support 
Add pref for prefs logger and remove lightweight persisted prefs as those will be generated. 
Fetch info/collections? with an extra "?" once a day on a normal sync so that it gets the same data but is easily differentiated in access logs. 
Bug 535670 - Poor UX on password change while connected
Bug 526937 - Bookmarks are re-uploaded when they get visited
Bug 541722 - updating out of date machine can cause data to be reverted
Check if we haven't deleted yet, and if not, grab the guids for weave credentials and delete them from the server. 
Created a FakeSvc object to put fake services into. 
Always add the id and encryption value so client and delete records can be encrypted. 
Created a fake SessionStore service for Fennec that imitates the parts of Firefox's SessionStore API that we need. Then used the now "consistent" SessionStore service in the Tabs engine. 
Store data in cleartext instead of directly in the payload to have it encrypted with the CryptoWrapper. This cleans up some hacks needed to get the plain WBO client record to behave nicely with other encrypted data. 
Bug 544069 - Move bookmark parentid into the encrypted payload [r=mconnor]
Bug 547049 - Verify that encrypted payloads correspond to the requested record [r=mconnor]
Don't specially serialize/not encrypt delete records and store the deleted flag as part of the cleartext payload. 
Add an engines object to meta/global to track version and syncID for each engine. If the server is outdated, wipe the data and set a new version and syncID. If the client is oudated, ask for an upgrade. Differing syncIDs cause a reupload. All engines are right now the default version 1. 
Bug 549638 - Ensure that encrypted payloads haven't been tampered with [r=mconnor r=dolske]
Store a HMAC with the encrypted symmetric key instead of just the wrapped key and verify that the HMAC matches before unwrapping. Test that normal getting works and a tampered payload/HMAC fails but succeeds on restoring the correct HMAC. 
Start an abortTimer onStartRequest and refresh the timer on each onDataAvailable only to cancel on an onStopRequest. If the timer triggers, the sync/async call will be aborted. 
* When the prefpane is opened and there's an error, it will open to the correct page so that can be corrected
* If using a custom server, that will be reflected when shown that page in the prefpane 
Bug 534218 - Changing sync direction from outdated clients loses client/server data [r=mconnor]
Bug 559674 - Put the xpi type (dev/rel) in the updated url [r=mconnor]
Add two constants: WEAVE_CHANNEL and UPDATED_URL that get preprocessed with @xpi_type@. 
Remove status bar icon/text for setup/connect/sync status. Add menuitem for setting up sync instead of drilling down a 1-item submenu that leads to a button. Remove unused Engine.displayName and related strings.

+ you can now nest groups inside of other groups (though all of the funky repercussions haven't been sorted out yet) 
+ Fixed bug causing the closing of unrelated tabs to destroy groups 
+ Added a doc folder that contains generated documentation

+ Commented out js lint, which doesn't seem to work in this context
+ The "new tabs" group can now not be renamed or closed, but it can be moved and resized. Updated how item locking works to accommodate this.

+ Consolidated onFocus call of UIClass into onFocus call of Page
+ Started on iQ for tabitems.js; now using iQ for TabItem.setBounds. We're not yet supporting the tabcandy bounce animation, so the tab movement boring now… to be fixed soon.
+ Temporarily added a bunch of logging for debugging purposes (commented out)
+ Converted Group.newTab over to iQ (was the last jQuery bit besides drag/drop/resize) 
+ Fixed a bug with groups looking like they were deleted but not really being 
+ updated/added license blocks to all JavaScript files 
+ Updated the website to pull the documentation section from the Etherpad

just some comments to pushAway and related functions; rm legacy squishModes; pushAway now uses Trenches.gutter for margins, and respects safe window bounds 
+ started work on the first run experience: everything goes into a single new group, and there is an info item as well
Directly access gBrowser.selectedTab and compare other raw tabs against it until BrowserTab goes away. Get the reference to the BrowserTab instead of iterating over Tabs through .tabcandyBrowserTab. 
- simplified Utils.extend. Deep copy is no longer supported, nor is extending iQ and iQ.fn using extend. They were not being used.

+ initial messing around; started a new page for my experiments, as well as a branching page to get between experiments 
Integrated selections into my tab demo. 
+ updated main index.html to point to all experiences
+ Updated to jQuery 1.4.2
+ updated the original and ian1 candies so the thumbnail scales automatically with the jquery animation of the whole tab 
* Ported changes over to the original candy
+ Fixed a bug where dragging a tab within a group and dropping it again would add it  a second time. Related to this bug, found that tabs were being added to the Group._children sometimes as DOM elements and sometimes as jQuery objects. Standardized on DOM objects
+ moved a number of the group-related styles into css/shared/groups.css. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to move everything I wanted to; Firefox 3.7 screwed up the relative URL in the resizer style, and somehow killed the position:absolute in close style (neither of those problems showed up in Firefox 3.6). At any rate, it's a step in the right direction.
+ Reverted from CSS-Transitions to jQuery Animations. There were just too many errors using Firefox 3.7 (like that new tabs stopped appearing, and closed tabs stopped dissapearing!)
+ Created "revision-a" candy, mostly based on original, but with some additions from ian1 
Updated the group code to have a sane arrangement algorithm. 
+ Documented the Item interface in items.js
+ you can now nest groups inside of other groups (though all of the funky repercussions haven't been sorted out yet) 
+ Fixed bug causing the closing of unrelated tabs to destroy groups 
+ Added a doc folder that contains generated documentation
+ We now have a "new tabs" group that new tabs go into (created as needed)
-- The only surving translation of the last song of the commited. 
Updated toolbar-button.js:
+ The badge only gets updated when a tab finished *loading* 
Updated the specification to include the stacks metaphore. 
+ Started work on Squish!™ code, not ready yet, so disabled 
+ started locking down the "new tabs" group
+ finished locking down the "new tabs" group… can no longer be renamed or auto deleted
+ Updated Utils logging to deal gracefully with object properties you can't access (for permissions reasons, for instance)
+ user-set sizes are now respected when unsquishing 
+ Created a new easing function called "tabcandyBounce" (which will soon be all the rage in the underground dance clubs fo Europe).
+ Commented out the _render routine in toolbar-button.js,  as it was throwing exceptions and didn't seem to work anyway
+ Commented out js lint, which doesn't seem to work in this context
+ The activated group is now set when you open a stacked tray's overlay. This means that new tabs go in the right spot for stacked groups. 
   change the order of tabs in the tab bar, those changes will be reflected
+ Updated documentation (since Aza's been commenting!) 
Updated a comment. 
+ The "new tabs" group can now not be renamed or closed, but it can be moved and resized. Updated how item locking works to accommodate this.
+ Fixed: On scale-up the tab is sometimes rotated.
+ Created Utils.copy to make duplicating objects cleaner
+ The last tab you were viewing is now highlighted as the focused tab.
+ If you close the selected tab, we now set the selected tab variable to null 
+ Starting firefox with tab candy selected now hides the tab bar
+ Fixed: Quit Firefox and relaunch. You'll reopen with that tab, but the tab bar doesn't have its tab limited to the containing group. It should limit them. 
+ Fixed a bug whereby hitting return in the group name would zoom in on the selected tab. 
+ Updated the hover-state for dropping a tab into a group: * [P] The indication that you are dropping a tab onto a group should not be on the tab, but on the group.[Aza]
+ Various related fixes
+ Reconnected storage sanity checks
+ Added UserVoice back to TabCandy, but this time without pulling in untrusted code from the web into a privledged context.
+ Started iQ, replacement for jQuery
+ Converted Utils.js to use iQ instead of jQuery
+ Made the css for debug-related buttom buttons more generic.
+ Started on event handling for iQ 
+ Started work on iQ animations with CSS transitions; not ready yet
+ iQ event binding works now; converted over some of the usage in ui.js
+ Consolidated onFocus call of UIClass into onFocus call of Page
+ Started on iQ for tabitems.js; now using iQ for TabItem.setBounds. We're not yet supporting the tabcandy bounce animation, so the tab movement boring now… to be fixed soon.
+ Temporarily added a bunch of logging for debugging purposes (commented out)
+ Converted Group.newTab over to iQ (was the last jQuery bit besides drag/drop/resize) 
+ Fixed a bug with groups looking like they were deleted but not really being 
+ Fixed a couple of zooming issues related to closing tabs while you're in them 
reverted to previous version of the trench checking algorithm 
+ updated/added license blocks to all JavaScript files 
+ groups.js is now fully documented (except for member variables) 
+ Updated the website to pull the documentation section from the Etherpad
+ Commented out the click-on-group to zoom into the last active tab 
+ Raymond's close button fix missed a couple cases: creating new tabs with command+click, and closing non-selected tabs with the close buttons in the tabbar. Fixed. 
+ Opacity was effected, so backed out my iQ change. 
+ In the quest to abolish reloadBounds(), I've rewritten draggable, droppable and resizable to operate on an item's bounds rather than directly on the div. I've also removed those routines from iQ, and integrated them into Item. Additional related cleanup and documentation.
just some comments to pushAway and related functions; rm legacy squishModes; pushAway now uses Trenches.gutter for margins, and respects safe window bounds 
don't snap to anything (except edges) if you're on top of another group (fixes bug reported by Aza: snapping onto another group) 
+ Updated the spec
+ Fixed: Bug 575675 - FindChildWithRules aRelevantLinkVisited assertion when loading tabcandy page
+ Created a platform-specific css file for tabcandy in the theme directory.
+ started work on the first run experience: everything goes into a single new group, and there is an info item as well
UI: reusing getAllTabs more; killed getVisibleTabs as it was not doing what it stated... replaced with getVisibleTabCount 
UI: showOnlyTheseTabs: a faster way to find visibleTabs, by checking the associated tabbrowser 
+ I don't think we need the timeout in Page.showChrome; commented out now.
- TabItems: fixed bug where phantom trenches were created when a tab in a group is closed, but the group was not closed.
- Use Rect.css more consistently: gets rid of some spurious CSS unknown value warnings when moving trenches, and simplifies Item._updateDebugBounds and Group.setNewTabButtonBounds
+ trenches are no longer activated if the item they projected from is a faux item or is being dragged
Directly access gBrowser.selectedTab and compare other raw tabs against it until BrowserTab goes away. Get the reference to the BrowserTab instead of iterating over Tabs through .tabcandyBrowserTab. 
Bug 581286 - Don't duplicate tabbox.advanceSelectedTab and key handling code
- simplified Utils.extend. Deep copy is no longer supported, nor is extending iQ and iQ.fn using extend. They were not being used. 
+ Updated the iQ license block as specified in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=582025 
+ Commented out the "refresh" and "reset" items on the dev menu in response to Bug 584372 (Firefox will crash if either Refresh or Reset in the Dev menu of the Visual Tab Interface is selected); we may bring these back in the future if needed for dev work, but they won't be in the shipping version. 
- new tab experience for tabs-off-of-orphaned-tabs is implemented: they magically turn into a group, and it even snaps!
+ Started groups.js module (nothing to see yet)
Move private variables/methods into local declarations not exported by AllTabs and change the interface to .register("change") instead of .onChange() for bug 584532. 
Bug 582023: move to use getBoundingClientRect instead of reading off the computed CSS for bounds; simplify getPropertyValue usage (based on comments from Dao)

Bug 661101 backout a part of 9014863a7e2a which was included to the mq file unexpectedly 
This blocks using cross-domain images and tainted canvases as WebGL textures, in response to a timing attack allowing to get approximations of cross domain images' pixel data.
This is known to break legitimate Web content (e.g. bug 662570), so it's sad to have to land this. In the hopefully near future, a way forward will be implemented allowing affected Web content to resume working: we will allow cross-domain textures that have CORS approval. This is being coordinated with other WebGL implementers on the WebGL mailing lists.

This makes the buffer-offscreen-test.html test pass. It was failing because it relied on getting composited and fell outside the visible area. 
The bindX() commands were erroring with INVALID_VALUE when they're instead supposed to simply fail silently when they're given a deleted object. Additionally, the getParameter() function was failing after its associated variable was deleted, sometimes returning values when it should return null.
DeleteRenderbuffer and DeleteFramebuffer weren't checking if the deleted buffer was the currently bound buffer before deleting them. This patch implements this functionality. A separate test case patch was also submitted to Khronos:
There was actually some surrounding logic breaking 0-size textures. It was because there was code that basically checked "did uint=negative_num*other_vars overflow". For incorrect validation, two copies of the same variable (one stored internally and one passed in) were available to the function, but the one stored internally was being validated, while the version passed in wasn't. The fix for this was simply checking the passed var instead.

Bug 684327 - Introduce js-implemented test component. r=khuey 
AFAICT we'd crash if we hit these cases anyway. bsmedberg and khuey requested that I assert against this case within XPConnect, and file a bug to make XPIDL enforce that [shared] parameters exist only in [noscript] methods. Filed bug 685281 for this. 
XPC_JSArgumentFormatter adds 3 special format string tokens to spidermonkey: %ip, %iv, and %is. These were unused outside of testing according to a free-text MXR search, and don't appear to be well-documented anywhere either. They also happen to be quite dangerous and easy to use improperly: we pass untyped variadic parameters to XPCConvert::JSData2Native with useAllocator==false. This causes JSData2Native to blindly cast the values to concrete class pointers (like nsAString*) and call methods on them. 
We only have one good reason for the useAllocator distinction: when C++ calls JS with a dipper parameter (ie, a string), the caller has already created the relevant nsAString or nsCString, so we shouldn't allocate another one. All other uses are superfluous or irrelevant, so we can get rid of them.

Implemented OES_standard_derivatives and fallbacks if it isn't available. Exposes dFdx, dFdy, and fwidth functions to WebGL scripts. 
WebGL objects keep an array of refptrs of other WebGL objects owning references to them. In practical cases, the size of this array can oscillate between 0 and 2 at high frequency. nsTArray throws away its whole storage (mHdr) when its size hits 0. This patch makes us use a nsAutoTArray with a pre-allocated size of 2 or 8 depending on WebGL object types.

These IIDs were used in the past to check, using do_QueryInterface, that the objects passed to WebGL functions were really of the expected type. Now that WebGL classes are marked 'builtinclass' in the IDL and that check has been removed (see bug 638328), none of that is needed anymore. 
This patch implements WebGLRefCountedObject, a base class for WebGL objects that implements a "WebGL refcount" mirroring the OpenGL refcount, separate from the XPCOM refcount. It collaborates with the WebGLRefPtr class introduced in patch 2.

Currently, WebGLProgram holds a hashtable of refptrs to all WebGLUniformLocation's created from it.
However, in a discussion on the public_webgl mailing list this week, we agreed that this was not mandated by the spec and that on the contrary, to ensure consistent behavior across browsers, we're going to require that NOT to happen. So this becomes a conformance issue.

Add a mParagraphDepth member to BidiParagraphData and cache it on frames to track nested bidi-isolated paragraphs. Use mParagraphDepth (* 2 + isRTL in order to keep LTR even and RTL odd) as the initial paragraph embedding level instead of pushing a stack of embedding codes. Pass the <bdi> frame instead of its first-child to BidiParagraphData::Reset and save a call to GetParent(). Split inline ancestors before and after bidi-isolated paragraphs, in the same way that we currently do between runs in different directions. This required also adding code to SplitInlineAncestors to handle situations where the parent frame is being split before its first child or after its last child. In JoinInlineAncestors, prevent frames that belong to paragraphs isolated from one another from being rejoined. Bug 712600, r=ehsan, roc

The solution is to keep the nsCSSValue::Image alive longer.  This patch adds two new types of nsAttrValue.  The first is an nsCSSValue::URL.  A ParseBackgroundAttribute method is added on nsGenericHTMLElement that the relevant elements (body/td/th/table/tr/tbody/thead/tfoot) call that parses background into an nsCSSValue::URL.  The second is an nsCSSValue::Image.  nsGenericHTMLElement::MapBackgroundInto attempts to convert the nsCSSValue::URL into an nsCSSValue::Image by kicking off the image load.  The result is that image loads are only started when the element is actually visible.  This also mirrors the way background-image works.  This also allows us to fix two longstanding bugs in this code.  Since MapBackgroundInto doesn't have a pointer to the actual element, it relied on grabbing the principal of the document.  Now we can grab the principal of the node in ParseBackgroundAttribute.  MapBackgroundInto also has no way to get at the element's base URI (to honor xml:base), which is now possible in ParseBackgroundAttribute.
nsCSSValue::[Image|URL] have also been moved to be mozilla::css::[Image|URL]Value.  nsAttrValue.h is included in external linkage code, so it can't include nsCSSValue.h to get the declarations of nsCSSValue::[Image|URL], and nested classes can't be forward declared.  Moving the classes to a namespace solves the problem.

Bug 779145 - Add support for unsoliciated onShutter and onClosed callbacks, handle OnNavigation to clean-up. r=jst 
This patch enables sharing of an nsAttrValue's MiscContainer between nodes for style rules.  MiscContainers of type eCSSStyleRule are now refcounted (with some clever struct packing to ensure that the amount of memory allocated for MiscContainer remains unchanged on 32 and 64 bit).  This infrastructure can be used to share most MiscContainer types in the future if we find advantages to sharing other types than just eCSSStyleRuley.  A cache mapping strings to MiscContainers has been added to nsHTMLCSSStyleSheet.  MiscContainers can be shared between nsAttrValues when one nsAttrValue is SetTo another nsAttrValue or when there is a cache hit in this cache.  This patch also adds the ability to tell a style rule that it belongs to an nsHTMLCSSStyleSheet, with appropriate accessor functions to separate that from the existing case of belonging to an nsCSSStyleSheet.
The primary use case is to reduce memory use for pages that have lots of inline style attributes with the same value.  This can happen easily with large pages that are automatically generated.  An (admittedly pathological) testcase in Bug 686975 sees over 250 MB of memory savings with this change.  Reusing the same MiscContainer for multiple nodes saves the overhead of maintaining separate copies of the string containing the serialized value of the style attribute and of creating separate style rules for each node.  Eliminating duplicate style rules enables further savings in layout through style context sharing.  The testcase sees the amount of memory used by style contexts go from over 250 MB to 10 KB.
Because the cache is based on the text value of the style attribute, it will not handle attributes that have different text values but are parsed into identical style rules.  We also do not attempt to share MiscContainers when the node's base URI differs from the document URI.  The effect of these limitations is expected to be low.

There's a related, functional bug also fixed here, which is that a browser process doesn't inherit its parent's app-id.  This causes problems e.g. for IndexedDB: If a browser inside an app uses IndexedDB, the DB should have the app's app-id.
I also modified Tab{Parent,Child} and nsFrameLoader to call "app" "ownOrContainingApp", to emphasize that we might have inherited the app from a parent process.  I left nsIDocShell::appId alone, because changing that would have necessitated changing nsILoadGroup and therefore a /lot/ of users in Necko; it's also not clear it would have clarified anything in those cases.

There's a related, functional bug also fixed here, which is that a browser process doesn't inherit its parent's app-id.  This causes problems e.g. for IndexedDB: If a browser inside an app uses IndexedDB, the DB should have the app's app-id.
I also modified Tab{Parent,Child} and nsFrameLoader to call "app" "ownOrContainingApp", to emphasize that we might have inherited the app from a parent process.  I left nsIDocShell::appId alone, because changing that would have necessitated changing nsILoadGroup and therefore a /lot/ of users in Necko; it's also not clear it would have clarified anything in those cases. 
The extra indentaiton was necessary because we wanted hg/git to notice that webapp_clearBrowserData.js was actually a rename of test_webapp_clearBrowserData.html.

The test normally ends when the image is discarded. But there is nothing in the test that requires the image to ever be decoded. To properly test the original bug that this test is intended for we want the following sequence: imgRequestProxy::Cancel, imgRequestProxy::ChangeOwner, and then the image getting discarded. The cancel call makes it hard to get a full decode started, especially since it needs to happen before the ChangeOwner call which itself happens quite early. So it appears that there is no easy way to modify the test to keep this sequence of events 100% of the time.

ERROR TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/chrome/toolkit/components/passwordmgr/test/test_privbrowsing_perwindowpb.html | uncaught exception - TypeError: normalWindowIframe is null at chrome://mochitests/content/chrome/toolkit/components/passwordmgr/test/test_privbrowsing_perwindowpb.html:266 
While writing a test for this, we discovered another problem.  The reftest print code does not actually use the printing codepath.  Instead it takes an existing document, tears down its presshell, and creates a new presshell for printing.  Fixing the above bug did not make the reftest print test pass because ImageLoader does not deal properly with presshell destruction/recreation.  It assumes that when the presshell is destroyed all of the css::ImageValues can be cleared of their entries for that document.  This fails for ImageValues for mapped attributes because they are held alive by the content tree.  When a new presshell for this document is then created there is no entry for the document and thus no image request to paint.  The fix for this is to only clear the frame to request and request to frame mapping hashtables and not to clear the document's entry on the ImageValue when the presshell is destroyed.  The destruction of the ImageLoader (which is held from a strong reference on the document) is when those entries are removed.  The final change is to change css::ImageValue's hashtable from holding a strong reference to the keys (which are documents) to holding raw pointer references.  This is safe because we clear the relevant entry when the corresponding ImageLoader dies, and is needed to prevent a reference cycle that was being broken by presshell destruction.

Bug 653881 - Rework XBL insertion points and clean up related code to more closely follow the Web Components model. Instead of maintaining a hashtable of insertion points in bindings (and removing insertions points from the tree) leave the insertion points in the tree as explicit placeholders and teach all other relevant code how to walk the explicit children of elements via two iterators (ExplicitChildIterator and FlattenedChildIterator). Note that this patch does not maintain 100% compatibility with the previous code: there are bug fixes and behavior changes included. For example, by having explicit insertion points in the bindings, it is now easier to handle dynamic changes to the bound element correctly (as well as, eventually, handling dynamic changes to the binding correctly).

complicated. 
Currently, in order to ensure that apps are translated before first paint, all l10n resources are included as one multi-locales JSON dictionary, which is serialized in an inline `<script>` element for each HTML document.  This works fine when shipping few locales, but it can increase the document size quite badly for 60+ locales, thus delaying the startup time very significantly.
The inline JSON dictionary is split on a per-locale basis (= one `<script>` node per supported locale) and only contains the l10n strings that are required to translate the HTML document: the "startup cost" of each locale becomes neglectable, and it removes the risk of high RAM consumption when parsing a giant multi-locale JSON at startup.
All l10n resources that are not declared in the HTML document are concatenated in a single JSON dictionary per locale: this reduces the number of disk I/O to load l10n resources and does not increase the total disk size of each webapp.  To enable this, this patch implements a `{{locale}}` quasi-litteral in the HTML markup that is used to declare l10n resources:

Attachment containers use `<iframe>` in the SMS app because they are handy in the Compose area (work well in a contenteditable element): this ensures that attachment blocks are deletable but not editable.  However, `<iframes>` are a pain to use in the message thread, and can become a performance killer on threads with lots of attachments.

- When all recipients are deleted, don't leave empty editable in the to-field.
- When the editable placeholder is contracted to a zero offset width, it's possible to accidentally tap a recipient when the intention is to tap the to-field area around the recipient list, which will correctly prompt the user to remove the recipient. Since there is no way to unambiguously detect the user's intention, always handle "Remove" and "Cancel" in an intuitive way.

Desc: Bug 898992: l10n.js should keep track of untranslated elements
If a document embeds an inline JSON dictionary, l10n.js translates the document right away without loading other l10n resources.  It usually works fine because our build system ensures the inline JSON dictionary contains all the necessary keys to handle the declarative content; but if an app adds some dynamic content to the document, when the user language is changed there might be some untranslated elements -- e.g. the "Add Contact" form in the Contacts app.
With this patch, l10n.js keeps track of untranslated elements:
* if an inline dictionary is used, untranslated elements will be translated as soon as all external l10n resources are loaded;
* instead of raising a JS warning each time an element can't be translated, l10n.js now sends one unique warning with all missing l10n keys when the document is translated.

Desc: Bug 901566 - For FB imported contacts hide 'find duplicates' option in contact details
This patch replaces metro's 'PromptService' (which implements nsIPromptService and nsIPrompt, among others) with an implementation that simply forwards all calls to toolkit's nsPrompter.js. Before forwarding each call, it writes the "allowTabModal" property on the object obtained from nsPrompter.js, causing the created prompt to be tab-modal.
The crash reporter prompt is the only consumer of DialogUI.importModal and related code. The "modals" concept that DialogUI implements should go away in favor of tab-modal dialogs and tab-agnostic notifications (e.g. flyouts). I don't think that the crash reporter prompt should be a tab modal dialog; I'd prefer to see it become an about: page or perhaps a flyout.

Bug 899167 - Change 'SelectedText' to 'TextSelection' and move handling from browser.js to TextSelection.js, r=margaret 
This patch replaces metro's 'PromptService' (which implements nsIPromptService and nsIPrompt, among others) with an implementation that simply forwards all calls to toolkit's nsPrompter.js. Before forwarding each call, it writes the "allowTabModal" property on the object obtained from nsPrompter.js, causing the created prompt to be tab-modal.
The crash reporter prompt is the only consumer of DialogUI.importModal and related code. The "modals" concept that DialogUI implements should go away in favor of tab-modal dialogs and tab-agnostic notifications (e.g. flyouts). I don't think that the crash reporter prompt should be a tab modal dialog; I'd prefer to see it become an about: page or perhaps a flyout. Making it a tab-modal prompt was just the easiest thing to do in this set of patches.

Bug 953296 - Implement mozilla::NullptrT as a typedef to use to accept nullptr values.  Also add mozilla::IsNullPointer<T>, a trait for detecting *only* true nullptr (emulated nullptr [__null] used by gcc 4.4/4.5 isn't true nullptr).  r=ehsan
Generally, if you want a decltype(nullptr)-based overload, you should use SFINAE and IsNullPointer.  (Examples are provided in NullPtr.h comments.)  The problem is NullptrT matches far more than just __null as emulated nullptr for gcc 4.4/4.5 overloading purposes.  This problem is unavoidable without true nullptr.  Currently, the only valid use for NullptrT is believed to be in operator overloads.  All existing nullptr-overloading code has been rewritten to use the appropriate technique for the situation, and MOZ_HAVE_CXX11_NULLPTR is no longer an API.

For certain tests, the AndroidBridge is not initialized, but some GeckoAppShell functions are still called indirectly. For now, this patch adds checks to skip these calls if there's no AndroidBridge. However, in the future, most of the affected code should be refactored to not require these checks. 
HandleUncaughtException will be called by the generated JNI stubs that C++ code uses. HandleUncaughtException calls the new GeckoAppShell.handleUncaughtException method, which behaves exactly like the normal uncaught exception handler (annotates the crash report and crashes). GeckoAppShell.handleUncaughtException has the noThrow annotation that will be seen by the generated code; as a result, its generated stub will not call HandleUncaughtException and result in a loop. 
Bug 958706 - Make generated JNI wrappers handle uncaught exceptions; r=blassey
This patch adds AndroidBridge::HandleUncaughtException calls to generated JNI wrappers. Also, the JNI annotation now accepts the noThrow flag to indicate that the JNI caller wishes to handle Exceptions manually.

In nsImageLoadingContent whether a decode error put our image state into error depends on when the decode starts in relation to the network load event for the image. In nsImageLoadingContent::OnStopRequest if a decode has been started then we wait until the decode is complete to fire the load/error event. When we fire this event we also update the image state. However if a decode has not started by the time OnStopRequest runs, but a decode does happen later then when it completes nsImageLoadingContent::Notify does nothing, and our image state stays as non-error.

exports does assign the value for the exported variable in that execution
exported variable is reassigned, even if the value is not modified. Then,

never set those exported variables, so that they are not merged back. The
caller sandbox can then properly reassign the exported variable.

Bug 1094505 - Avoid using concatenated name in installer. r=rstrong 
Modern OSs adjust process scheduling based on CPU-boundedness and Interface-boundedness.  A process performing a lot of UI tasks requires lower-latency than a CPU-bound process.  For this reason, at least on Windows (but probably also Linux and Mac), in e10s, resize events are sent at a much higher rate than non-e10s, where the main process has to do the work to respond to them.  This was supposed to be handled by the 'compress' option in IPDL but its duplicate-event test was very imprecise - it only tested the *oldest* message in the queue.  This patch searches the messagequeue/deque to remove *any* duplicate.  deque::erase is linear but this is a very uncommon case - currently only two compressed IPDL messages exist in the entire code base.  Also, these queues are small.

This patch makes us behave similarly to when we're using the BasicCompositor, essentially we will clip all drawing to the final display to the area that was labeled as invalid. When DXGI 1.2 is available we will then also report the damaged area to the Present call so that can then be used to minimize the amount of bits that actually need to be blitted to the screen. Since we're no longer recompositing the whole screen this means we should also only clear the damaged area of the window. 
This will cause us to use WARP for composition on systems with Direct3D 11 when hardware acceleration is blacklisted or we're unable to find a powerful enough graphics card. It also allows us to force WARP on, in that situation WARP will also be used for Direct2D content rendering if Direct2D is enabled. Essentially this will ensure all systems running Windows 7 or higher always use D3D11 as their composition backend.

This one is a little complicated. There is some code in SetExistingProperty that is supposed to determine whether or not we should shadow a property that wasn't found on the receiver. This code does not work correctly for array.length properties. (array.length is a data property, so of course it should be shadowed -- but it is non-shadowable() because hasSlot() is false.)
As it stands, this code is relatively obscure, so the fact that it's amazingly busted is of little consequence. But once we implement ES6 assignment, this code will be fairly easy to trigger when assigning to any Proxy whose target is an Array.

Without this patch, a user is misled by use of private browsing when copying (or in some case just selecting) large blocks of text. A condition (presently hard coded at one million bytes kLargeDatasetSize) produces a cache file on disk regardless of whether private browsing is in use. This violates Mozilla's design (documented online at https://support.mozilla.org/kb/private-browsing-browse-web-without-saving-info/ and https://wiki.mozilla.org/PrivateBrowsing) This patch simply corrects the violation, discovered and resolved by the Tor Browser community.

Containerless scrolling means that the pan zoom controller applies it's transforms (to compensate for differences between the state of layout the last time we painted and the current state as composited to the screen) to the layers that are scrolled instead of the container layer that contains the layers that scroll.
When running test_animations_omta.html there is a zoom of 1.306122 applied, and the page is scrolled down to 67 screen pixels (before the test starts, not sure why exactly). Gecko scrolls as close to 67 screen pixels as it can: 67/1.306122 = 51.29689 css pixels, which is 3077.813 appunits. Gecko scrolls to 3078 app units. When AsyncCompositionManager::TransformScrollableLayer runs we calculate the scroll position of gecko and the current scroll position that the pan zoom controller is using. Since there are no async pan or zoom operations taking place these should match. However when the gecko scroll position is calculated we get 3078/60*1.306122 = 67.0040586. So it applies a transform of 0.0040586 to the container layer for the transform that test_animations_omta.html is animating off main thread. When test_animations_omta.html reads the transform of this layer it fails because it's expecting 0 and 0.0040586 is outside of it's epsilon for considering it to be close enough.

This is motivated by three separate but related problems:
1. Consolidate some handling of microtasks and all handling of stable state from appshell and WorkerPrivate into CycleCollectedJSRuntime.
2. Make the recursionDepth counter only available to CycleCollectedJSRuntime (and its consumers) and remove it from the nsIThreadInternal and nsIThreadObserver APIs.
3. Adjust the recursionDepth counter so that microtasks run with the recursionDepth of the task they are associated with.
4. Introduce the concept of metastable state to replace appshell's RunBeforeNextEvent. Metastable state is reached after every microtask or task is completed. This provides the semantics that bent and I want for IndexedDB, where transactions autocommit at the end of a microtask and do not "spill" from one microtask into a subsequent microtask. This differs from appshell's RunBeforeNextEvent in two ways:

When scrolling an inactive subframe, the target APZC confirmation needs to be sent along with the layers transaction. If a new wheel event comes in while that target APZC notification is in-flight, the subframe will already have a display port, so the confirmation will be sent in a more direct fashion and can arrive at the APZ controller thread before the new APZC for the scroll frame has been created. Then the current input block will have a null target APZC and no scrolling will happen until a new input block is created.

Bug 1156238. Always stop at the root reference frame when looking for an animated geometry root. r=roc,mattwoodrow
Bug 1156238. Fix the computation of animated geometry roots for transform items. r=mattwoodrow
Removing the "stop at ancestor" parameter from functions that compute AGR meant that nsLayoutUtils::GetAnimatedGeometryRootFor could no longer pass the display item's reference frame as the "stop at ancestor" which meant that the AGR could cross the reference frame for the item, which we don't want. So we make transformed frames into AGRs.
This makes the computation of display items whose frames are transformed tricky. We need the AGR of the transform item to be the ancestor AGR, not the underlying frame of the transform item (which is now an AGR). So we modify nsLayoutUtils::GetAnimatedGeometryRootFor to handle this. (The patch from bug 1205087 didn't suffer from this problem because it special cased the computation of the AGR of transform items. Leaving anybody who called nsLayoutUtils::GetAnimatedGeometryRootFor to get the wrong result.)
The computation of the AGR for scroll metadata in ContainerState::ProcessDisplayItems specifically bypassed nsLayoutUtils::GetAnimatedGeometryRootFor to avoid it's special processing of fixed background items. However we do want the AGR for scroll metadata to do this special processing of transform items. So we add a flag to bypass the fixed background behaviour and use it for the scroll metadata AGR. 
Displayports only get acted upon when painting to the window, and the async scroll clips only get computed when we use a displayport.
In addition we change an assert because if we are painting to the window then our root reference frame is either a root frame, or a popup frame. In either case we should not be able to get to out of flows outside of the frame subtree rooted at the root reference frame by following placeholders.
