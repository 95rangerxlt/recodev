It also adds functionality to browser.js for creating tab modal prompts. One of the changes made as part of adding this functionality is replacing the <browser> with a <stack> of <browser> objects. 
The "dialog" concept is unused (the last consumer was the sync setup UI which is now a flyout) and is obsolete since we have prompts. 
The crash reporter prompt is the only consumer of DialogUI.importModal and related code. The "modals" concept that DialogUI implements should go away in favor of tab-modal dialogs and tab-agnostic notifications (e.g. flyouts). I don't think that the crash reporter prompt should be a tab modal dialog; I'd prefer to see it become an about: page or perhaps a flyout. Making it a tab-modal prompt was just the easiest thing to do in this set of patches.
