Backed out changeset b79cddbe7de8 (bug 1142669) for causing bug 1112947 to spike. 
Bug 1112947 - Replace a setTimeout with an EventListener to fix an intermittent failure in browser/extensions/pdfjs/test/browser_pdfjs_navigation.js. r=mossopgmail.com

This patch also fixes three small typos in the code. Two of them are trivial spelling errors, while the third one concerns the removal of an EventListener in the function |setZoomToPageFit|.
