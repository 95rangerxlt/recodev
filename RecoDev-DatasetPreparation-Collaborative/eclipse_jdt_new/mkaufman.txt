Changes to support fixing up build classpath errors from the builder.  Support for a fix for Bugzilla 103590. Removed our apt-specific ordering of the jdt-tests, since that is no longer necessary.  This should resolve bugzilla 101144, although I left the "AllJdtCoreTests" class in CVS since we may at some point need to change the ordering around (it was never clear why this was necessary, but was helpful in the past).

Replaced a couple of UnsupportedOperationExceptions with logic to actually return an appropriate OutputStream.  Change by mkaufman. 
Re-enabling type-generation during reconcile. Also java-doc'd and cleaned up APIs for GeneratedFileManager. This should address the following bugs:

mkaufman.  Chagnes required to get the fact that we updated the project's classpath during file-generation back to the AptCompilationParticipant. 
Bugzilla Bug 103746    add ability to specify generated-src dir in GeneratedFileManager . 

Bugzilla Bug 103746    add ability to specify generated-src dir in GeneratedFileManager . Removing dead code. 
Bugzilla 95661 - unable to create generated files if project root is a source dir 

Bugzilla 95661 - unable to create generated files if project root is a source dir - Fix for bugzilla 101944:   I made sure that we are never holding the GeneratedFileManager's lock before doing any java model operations, or doing any resource operations.  This should prevent the deadlock reported in 101944. 

- Fix for bugzilla 101944:   I made sure that we are never holding the GeneratedFileManager's lock before doing any java model operations, or doing any resource operations.  This should prevent the deadlock reported in 101944. - fixed paths for creating the correct directories for apt source code. 
- Disabling type-generation during reconcile.  Tracked by Bugzilla 103183. 

- Disabling type-generation during reconcile.  Tracked by Bugzilla 103183. Adding back some code that got removed somehow.  Specifically, 
- updated paths to source directory 
- updated script with a hacky way to set the DATE_SUFFIX for the modified zip. 
- fixes to get the sdk.zip file to work - added a cmd script to easily build the apt plugins, and create an sdk.zip file 
- fixed logic on where to place text files that are created via the FilerImpl - fixed ClassCastException in PackageUtil 
- updated o.e.jdt.apt.core exportplugin.xml to include .options file - added exportplugin.xml to the o.e.jdt.apt.ui project 
 - updated format for some log statements to include phase, thread name, & file being run through apt. 
- added support for a tracing option for the apt core plugin.  When you do "Run...| eclipse applicaiton |..." there should now be an option on the tracing pane to turn on debug tracing for the apt core plugin. 
- uniified constructors for ProcessorEnvImpl. - Fixed bugzilla 101171. 

- uniified constructors for ProcessorEnvImpl. - Fixed bugzilla 101171. - fix for concurent modification exception 
- reordered tests so that the model tests run first.  If not, the model tests fail.  This is being tracked by Bugzilla 101144. 

- reordered tests so that the model tests run first.  If not, the model tests fail.  This is being tracked by Bugzilla 101144. - updates to get jdt-apt tests passing on RC2. 
Some changes  to APTDispatch to try to avoid the "Invalid Being Rule" errors, but they didn't work. 
- removed tabs and replaced them with four spaces for consistent formatting. 
Updated howtobuildme.txt with correct instructions. 
- Updated AnnotationProcessorFactoryLoader to load factories from jar files. 
Refactored loading of AnnotationProcessorFactories 
- Fixed a bug where we would not detect that a working copy was discarded when the working copy owner was not the primary working copy owner - Enabled junit test that makes sure we detect discarded working copies and clean up cached data appropriately 
- removed Discouraged Access warnings from tests package. 
- eliminated the "Discouraged Access warnings from org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core module.  (they are still in org.eclipse.jdt.apt.tests module). 
- Fix build break - Change name from AptDispatchRunnable to APTDispatchRunnable. 
- Added support for an IElementChangedListener to close generated files' cached working copies when their parent has been closed - Added a DRT case for the above, but it is failing now.  I need to investigate this and enabled the DRT case. - Wrapped APT Dispatch up in an IWorkspaceRunnable.  This seems to prevent the deadlock that I saw, and is more efficient with broadcasting resource-chagned events. 
- Added support to handle deletion of the generated source folder - optimized creation of the generated source folder - fixed a bug where we would get "invalid being rule..." exception when refreshing the workspace 
- Cleaned up maps in GeneratedFileManager to no longer use type-name.  We now use two maps to represent a generate file/parent file matrix, and two maps to manage cached working copies. - renamed some stuff from "derived" to "generated" to be consistent - updated some comments 
- Added support to do reconcile-time clean-up of previously generated files that are no longer generated by a parent's APT processing. - Added a test case to test the clean-up
