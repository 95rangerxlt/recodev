When you middle-click or Ctrl+click a URL within the inspector's markup view, the link is opened in a new tab. When you then switch back to the previous tab (without closing the newly opened tab) and move the mouse into the inspector you see that you're dragging the just clicked tag.

Test case:
1. Inspect the 'More Features' link at https://getfirebug.com/.
2. Middle-click its URL path "/whatisfirebug" within the inspector
   => A new tab will be opened in the foreground showing "https://getfirebug.com/whatisfirebug". (OK)
3. Switch back to the preview tab
4. Move the mouse over the markup view of the inspector

=> The tag <a href="/whatisfirebug">More Features »</a> will be dragged.

Yep, I can confirm this issue.  We will need to get it fixed before 8-10 when we ship 42.  John, do you think you'll have a chance to look at this bug or should we assign it to someone else?
I can look into it, no problem.
Thanks!

Quick patch to stop the drag.  It's just an else statement around the drag logic that separates it from the meta- or middle-click logic.

San you upload a new version of this with the suggested change?  I've also got a regression test patch incoming that I'll attach to the bug

I'd rather have an early return here than the else just to limit nesting and a more accurate history on the file

Updated the patch to use a return statement instead of the else.  Do I need to do anything with the regression test patch?

Nope, we will just check them in as two separate patches.  Here's an ongoing try push: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=157241d0b3e7
