Patch

Thanks for patching this, Michael!

In this case I would make the getter a property of the global object, rather than of gAppUpdater. It's not a big deal either way, but importing things into the global is more conventional. Should just involve moving the defineLazyModuleGetter call to the top of aboutDialog.js (next to the import of Services.jsm) and adjusting the reference from gAppUpdater.UpdateChannel to just "UpdateChannel".

Per the discussion in the other bug, I think we should also switch the code touched in that bug to use beginsWith("release") rather than |== "release"|, to handle the case of partner builds with more complicated update channels.

Can you make those updates to the patch and re-post an updated version, with another review request? Let me know if I can advise further.

Actually, maybe using /^release($|\-)/.test(channelLabel) would be better, to avoid potential "releasefoo" channels being treated the same way as UpdateChannel's "release-foo" channels.

Thanks Michael!

I tested this patch by running Firefox and then running the following JS code in a chrome context before opening the dialog:

> Services.prefs.getDefaultBranch(null).setCharPref("app.update.channel","release")
> Services.prefs.getDefaultBranch(null).setCharPref("app.update.channel","release-foopy")
> Services.prefs.getDefaultBranch(null).setCharPref("app.update.channel","releasefoopy")
