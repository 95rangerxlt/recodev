Currently on the build above, when inspecting an image one is unable to right click to open a context menu on the currently selected image.

STR:
1. Open Minefield
2. At http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/, turn on the Inspector
3. Mouse over to the Get Involved star picture on the right
4. Attempt to right click the image to open the context menu

ER: Context menu opens on right click
AR: No context menu opens on right click

Doubt it, this is when Inspector is enabled and you hover/select an image.
This should be fixed by bug 642471
