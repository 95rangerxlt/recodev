I'd like to take another pass when there are docs to make sure I get it properly.

Nit: stand-in? Avoids people going 'standing? what's a standing node?'

How confident are you that there are no falsey arrays?
I don't think there are any, but I don't know the depths of wtfjs.
From dherman's Effective JavaScript,

"There are exactly seven falsy values: false, 0, -0, "", NaN, null, and undefined.  All other values are truthy."

An empty array might still == null, but we're good on truthiness.
