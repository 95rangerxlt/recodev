WIP 1

This is untested, but I think it should work.  Doesn't yet fake child list mutations for iframe loads, I'll probably save that for a followup.

This is kind of a prove-i've-been-here comment. Wouldn't 'mutation' be a better name:

    for (let mutation of mutations) ....

Ignore at will.
I used 'change' instead of 'mutation' because it seemed to small a change from 'mutations' by total percentage of characters.  But I kinda regret that now.

Enough patches would bitrot if I changed that now that I'd prefer a followup if we care enough.

Boy did I mess that sentence up.

"mutation" vs "mutations" seemed harder to see the difference between than "change" vs. "mutations".  But I regret that, I think.
