Setup:
- Open bugzilla.mozilla.org
- Use the search box icon to add the bugzilla search engine
- Go to the search engine settings, and add a "bz" keyword to that bugzilla search engine

Get a feeling of the normal UX:
- go in the awesome bar ; type "bz", press enter ; that opens bmo.
- go in the awesome bar ; type "bz 123456", press enter ; that ends up on bug 123456.

Now, for the problematic part:
- in a new tab, go to https://bz.selenic.com/
- close the tab
- go in the awesome bar ; type "bz". Now you have bz.selenic.com pre-filled, with ",selenic.com" selected. That was already the case before. What changed, is:
- hit backspace, press enter ; nothing happens
  - now hit space, and bmo is opened.
  - if instead you hit backspace, a search is done for "b" on your default search engine

I think this is just bug 1172937.
current 41 should be unaffected, afaik, since unified complete has been recently disabled.
Indeed, it doesn't happen with current aurora anymore (happened with aurora from a few days ago)
Now something happens when pressing enter, but it's the wrong thing due to bug 1187753.
fixed by the dependencies.


Interaction in the url bar with search engine keywords conflicting with awesomebar history became weird
