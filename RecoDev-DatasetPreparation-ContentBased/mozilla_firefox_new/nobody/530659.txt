I am using Firefox 3.6 beta 3. I have cleared all browser history/temp related files using CCleaner and re-installed Flash to attempt to resolve the following two problems:


1) When signing into facebook chat I get disconnected and reconnected about 4 times
2) About 20% of all IMs I send end up not being sent for several minutes, if at all

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Facebook chat
2. 
3.
