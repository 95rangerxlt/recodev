Something didn't like having the version go from 44 to 45, busting xpcshell, https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=2546798&repo=mozilla-central

m-c's closed, "on a CLOSED TREE" por favor.

This is preventing us from merging the version bump around and reopening trunk trees. Any chance you can take a look? Is Sync itself still working? Could we just disable these tests for now to green things up until a fix can land?
I'm not familiar with these tests at all.  It looks like Kit recently added the lines where these tests are now failing.
e.g.

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/ac68828c5e3e/services/sync/tests/unit/test_addons_store.js#l398

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/f4ccde68eaf7/services/fxaccounts/tests/xpcshell/test_accounts.js#l230
I'm not sure why the telemetry tests are failing. I'll have a look; if nothing else, I can back out the test changes.

I don't know if we're still using the probes added in bug 1124428, but I think this should fix the failures.
Landed in https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/1fbc958f7557 without the review to get things reopened.
Looks like it worked.
