The AMO site for clipmarks has a version for FF3.0a3, so work is underway. I'd like to see a FF3.0b2+ version to feel better about its progress.
I am working on the new version as we speak.  Unfortunately for me, something changed with popup menu's between FF3.0a3 and FF3.0b2 and caused some of our menus to break.
looks like it reports that it is compatable with current trunk builds (beta3 pre) and lets me install on Mac, but I don't see any clipmark icon showing up between the location bar and search bar. 
addons site shows  
Firefox: 1.5 â€“ 3.0b3 
allows me to install on windows too ( Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-IN; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008013104 Minefield/3.0b3pre ) but no clipmarks icon there either.

This is due to bug 414836, which has been fixed (but not in your build). I have a fixed build and the toolbar icon does appear.
However, Clipmarks has been bitten by the removal of scriptable IO (bug 414901). I get several errors in the error console because IO.newURI is no longer shipping with FF3.
changelog of Clipmarks 3.0.3 states on a.m.o:
"Added support for Firefox 3.0pre and updated the site links menu."

a quick test confirms this -> FIXED?
We are definitely not getting the errors, but it is not because we did anything to fix it.  When I went to work on this bug I couldn't reproduce it so I contact finkle and we as no longer able to reproduce it either.
Last time I checked, I didn't see the IO.newURI code in the extension
on AMO. woot.
