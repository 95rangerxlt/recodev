If you click on History and then Show All History, the Library window opens and if you double click on the Name, Location, Visit Date or other column name, CPU usage spikes to 100% and the Library window will minimize and the current tab will be loaded with whatever link is highlighted in your history.  

However, if you open the Library window and you look at Tags or All Bookmarks and then go back to the History and double click on the column name, it only spikes the CPU as it sorts the History, it doesn't minimize or open a highlighted link.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click History -> Show All History
2. Double click on Name, Location, Visit Date, etc.

Actual Results:  
CPU usage spikes to 100%, the Library window minimizes and whatever link is highlighted is opened in the current tab.

Expected Results:  
1 click on the column name should sort it by default behavior. Double clicking should be whatever the default behavior is (undo maybe?).

I see same on Vista HP SP1 and build:

Is even a regression: first half of 2008.

Camino and Firefox UI have essentially no code in common.
oops. sorry i misread the product there
I am still seeing this issue exhibited in the latest 20090330050334 build of 3.5b4pre.
I am not seeing this issue in 3.5.3 or 3.7a1pre. I'm pretty sure that Bug #480238 fixed this issue, so I am closing this out as fixed.


Double clicking column title spikes CPU and causes Library window to minimize
