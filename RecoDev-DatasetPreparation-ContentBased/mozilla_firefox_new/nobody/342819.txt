On Mac OS X, can't search via the quick search field.  

a)  command k (or focus on quicksearch field).  enter terms.  hit enter. nothing happens. 

Can perform a search after doing another action like opening a tab and then works correctly thereafter.

Does this only happen with Google or Yahoo (engines that have suggest)? I think this is a duplicate of bug 337386.
Looks like a dupe of 337386.  I'm not getting the autocomplete results at all (so doesn't show up for me even after a wait) and I thought I had this issue w/ Amazon too but checking.   

I'm having difficult reproducing.  It sounds like the problem may occur only once. 

If it is a dupeof bug 337386, then it's likely to occur more often if you connection is bogged down, for what it's worth.
There isn't anything wrong w/ my connection at all so it's not the connection for me.

WFM in 2.0RC2
Rafael, have you ever seen this again? The followup fixes to bug 337386 (bug 344189) should have fixed this.
WFM now too.  Marking as fixed per gavin's comment.
