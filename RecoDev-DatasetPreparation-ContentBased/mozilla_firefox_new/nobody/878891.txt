This PDF displays correctly in Chrome 27, and IE 10. My coworker said it wasn't displaying right, so I checked various browsers. When I first looked at it in FF I was on version 20.0.1 - which displayed it correctly, then I clicked on Help > About Firefox and it auto-updated to version 21 and now the days of the week jumble together as shown in the attachment.
