about:tabcrashed uses events bubbled up to browser.js in order to message things to the chrome-level.

We should also move the tracking of how many crashed browsers there are from SessionStore to something like TabCrashReporter.

We should probably use RemotePageManager instead. Because about:tabcrashed is actually loaded internally by the docShell, this will also require some slight modification to RemotePageManager.

Special casing this seems unfortunate. Lots of people keep talking about supporting regexps for the urls, can we just do that?

This error isn't going to let a developer helpfully understand which listener was at fault. Move the check to addListener instead.

Can you add a comment about why this is necessary, I can't guess and so future maintainers proibably won't know either.

It's possible that there can be multiple ports for a browser if the interesting url is an inner frame. So this should probably return an array of ports. Callers can then assume there is only ever 1.

I spent some time looking at this, and I think it'd be good follow-up work, but maybe out of scope for this bug.

Done, but I'm not 100% confident I've done the right thing, security-wise. I'll r? bholley.

Bug 1220929 - Harden browser_crashedTabs.js against races. r?felipe
Hey bholley - requesting review on attachment 8682289 and attachment 8682288 because I'm waiving Xray wrappers here, and I'm not 100% certain that's the right thing to do.

Essentially, RemotePageManager allows us to expose sendAsyncMessage to less-privileged content if the URL of the page is registered in the chrome process.

Up until now, the listeners that the less-privileged content registers have been callback functions. The patches I've requested review from you on make it so that we can take objects that have a receiveMessage function property as well.

In order to see receiveMessage, however, I have to waive Xrays.

Is that the right way to do this?

Don't you need to store waived in the case of an object or callListeners won't be able to access receiveMessage.

So this definitiely isn't the right thing - thanks for flagging me for review!

The fact that addMessageListener is being called with arbitrary content objects suggests to me that we're poking a hole somewhere and not using WebIDL like we should be.

I've abandoned the idea of passing objects to RemotePageManager's addMessageListener, as per bholley's suggestion.
