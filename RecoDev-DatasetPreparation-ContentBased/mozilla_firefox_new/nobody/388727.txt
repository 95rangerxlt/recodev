User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 

Whenever I try to open Mozilla Firefox, the address bar along with the type for the quick links and File, etc. show up, but it doesn't actually open a window. A bar for Mozilla Firefox shows up in the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, and it shows up as a process in the task manager, but all it shows is text and nothing is clickable. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the web browser.

Actual Results:  
It did the problem I described

Expected Results:  
It should've opened the browser window so I could surf the internet.

After I uninstalled Firefox to try and install it again, it gives me an error message once the loader says that it is "Installing" that says that it could not re-write C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\chrome\classic.manifest and while keep saying that no matter how mant times I try. HELP PLEASE! Thanks.

I thought of that, too, but it doesn't work. Whenever I try to delete the file, it gives me an error message saying that it couldn't remove classic.manifest. It says that it's a 'data error (clyclic redundancy check).'

Also, it's not a limited account. I'm on an admin account. Thanks for the reply.

Did you try reinstalling Firefox in a new empty folder? First delete the previous Mozilla Firefox folder manually.

As I have already explained, I could not delete the only file manually because of an error message saying that it couldn't remove classic.manifest.
It says that it's a 'data error (clyclic redundancy check).'


It's not possible to delete a file on your own system, not even after a restart? Did you do malware/virus checks?
Maybe in the meantime you might want to simply unzip this file on your desktop or in another folder of your choice and double click on firefox.exe inside it: 
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2007-07-19-03-mozilla1.8/firefox-2.0.0.6pre.en-US.win32.zip
If it still doesn't work you could create a new profile:

Whoa, ok, now that firefox works, but it has a different symbol. It's a blue globe instead of the orange-blue globe? Either way, it works now. Thanks.

The web browser will open, but only shows text and address bar. No window opens.
