Running on Ubuntu 12.04

The text box in facebook chat windows does not let me move the caret around using the mouse, or by using the home and end keys.  I also can't seem to select text anywhere in the chat popup.

Expected behaviour: Mouse click should set caret position, Home key should move caret to start of line, End key should move caret to end of line.

Observed behaviour: Mouse click, Home key, and End key have no observed effect.
