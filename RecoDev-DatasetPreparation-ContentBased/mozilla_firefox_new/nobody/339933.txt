Simple to describe. I want to use static trunk build under my Ubuntu 6.06 (based on Gnome 2.14.1, so on GTK 2.8), and I have to apply patches from bug 305185 and from bug 328964.

Build process runs ok. But when I enter the "make -C browser/installer" in order to create the firefox archive, I get this error :

"rm -f -rf ../../dist/xpt

Erh... I commited a little mistake. It was not bug 328964 but bug 312951... Oops ;)
Maybe try building with --enable-installer instead of --disable-installer?
Here is the log of busting :

rm -f -rf ../../dist/xpt

          Packager::Copy("../../dist", "../../dist/firefox", \

Hope it helps ;)
What version of perl are you using?  And which shell is make using?
Perl ?

fred:~$ perl --version

This is perl, v5.8.7 built for i486-linux-gnu-thread-multi
(with 1 registered patch, see perl -V for more detail)

Shell ?

fred:~$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.1.17(1)-release (i486-pc-linux-gnu)
Copyright © 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

And an up-to-date ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

fred:~$ uname -a
Linux fredo 2.6.15-25-386 #1 PREEMPT Wed Jun 14 11:25:49 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux

Any other info needed ?

Forget to add, I changed my .mozconfig, removing "--disable-installer" line.
Does /bin/sh point to bash? 
/bin/sh is a symbolic link for bash.

Try this. 'package' is a reserved word in perl and your particular version may be getting confused by the use of '$package'.  I think it's unlikely that this is the problem but it's worth investigating.

make 1.81 compat patch, v1

The problem here comes from make version 3.81 which added an incompatibility with backslash-newline handling.

See bug 325148 which is about the same problem.

This patch takes the approach described there:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00988.html

The alternative would be to use make variables.

I did not test with older make version however.
patch "make 1.81..." seems to work great.

make 1.81 compat patch, v1

Something's still not right here.  With FC5's make 3.80, it runs the parses the commands but the perl command doesn't do anything and the next command fails because of the missing $(DIST)/xpt directory.  I just installed make3.81 locally and it doesn't work with this patch either.

hmm, I should really test with an older make to see what's happening.

When you test with make3.81 locally, pay attention to the fact that if you run your just compiled new make binary, it will invoke your system make version 3.80 if it is still available in your $PATH, as make invokes itself recursively. I have been hit by this problem when I tried with another locally compiled make. Otherwise, please ignore this if you have already taken the appropriate steps.

Use a macro to avoid the quote issue.  Tested with make 3.80 & 3.81 on FC5.

I'm a bit wrong there. In fact it takes the make location from the MAKE variable in config/autoconf.mk when invoking itself recursively.

I thought that GNU make would set MAKE to itself when forking sub-makes but it does look like the one in config/autoconf.mk is being used.  When explicitly setting MAKE=make381 on the command-line, then the first patch works for make 3.81 but not for make3.80.

Interesting... I'm not sure I understand why this is different than other places we use backslash continuations, though... does it have to do with the single-quoting?
I believe the single quote is the issue. According to bug 325148 comment 4, using double quotes works fine.
