Error log
The developer has been notified through AMO.
This was fixed 2 months ago (2.8beta).  I'm not sure the breakage was actually e10s related.  The problem was the add-on was no longer able to read preferences.  I was using 'UAPref = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/preferences-service;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPrefService);' in a function and it stopped working there.  If I moved it outside of functions it started working again.  (This also broke a few other extensions I happen to be running that I fixed the same way.)  I finally settled on using 'let UAPref = Services.prefs;' in its place and it works in functions again.
