Screenshot home icon in bookmark's toolbar

Highlighted error with a red line around it.
I can confirm this.
Actually, other small icons also have graphic glitches: there's a subtle vertical line on the right of the close button, and the bright outline around the refresh one looks imperfect. Note that this is for small icons only, not big ones.

This may already be known, though. I know it was brought up a while ago on Mozillazine.
Fixed after updates to icons over the last month or two. Resolving WORKSFORME
