Do you still reproduce this in the latest nightly ?

Yes. I downloaded the latest 64-bit version from nightly.mozilla.org (29.0a1 (2014-01-31)) and I still get the same results

tab separator ubuntu 12.04.png

I don't have elementary OS, but indeed, on a lighter Ubuntu theme, the tab separator is a little darker than the border beneath it.
Ubuntu 12.04 x86, 'radiance' theme, FF 29.0a1(2014-02-02).
This is fixed with the new tab separator.


Australis Tab Separator begins too dark with certain Gtk Themes under Linux
