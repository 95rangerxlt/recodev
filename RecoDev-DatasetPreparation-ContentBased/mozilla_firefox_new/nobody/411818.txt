The project home page has a developmental version that claims FX3 compatibility
Agreed, this extension seems well on its way to FF3 compatibility. See http://fireftp.mozdev.org/developers.html for beta downloads that work in FF3.

Resolving INVALID
Since it is not actually on AMO, I'm re-opening for tracking purposes.
This is about Fx3 (not other versions) compat, and the extension is supposed to be cross-platform => adjusting bug headers to Trunk/All/All
pinged Mime to see if we can get the latest fireftp on amo
message back in e-mail.

> Once Firefox 3 is released I will submit my updated extension to AMO :)
