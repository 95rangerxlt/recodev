I see no reason for deleteTabValue API to throw an exception when the key does not exist. It needs to be fixed, although we can use setTabValue(aTab, aKey, "") instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
var ss = Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Ci.nsISessionStore);
ss.deleteTabValue(gBrowser.mCurrentTab, "unread");
ss.deleteTabValue(gBrowser.mCurrentTab, "unread");

Seems reasonable...

This would be a good first bug for anybody looking to contribute.
Paul, if you're willing to act as a point person for anyone who wants to fix this bug, you can replace my name in the mentor field.
I know this code so sure, why not.
I'd like to take on this bug if that's ok. This would be my first bug, so I don't know my way around the codebase all that well yet.

Could someone confirm that I am looking at the right function here: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStore.js#1366
and that it is line 1381 that is the problem?

Also, how do I actually run the testcase supplied by ithinc to reproduce this bug?

That's definitely ok. This is a good bug to get your feet wet.

Correct. While we're at it, would you like to fix deleteWindowValue so that we have matching behavior?

> Also, how do I actually run the testcase supplied by ithinc to reproduce

Ideally you would write a test that can be run automatically, like the other tests in https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser/ and then you can run it with the rest of the session restore tests.

I'm not sure if there's a test for deleteValue in there (I would expect there to be one), but creating a new file is ok too. You can model it off one of the existing tests (and add it to the makefile).

If you need anything else, just let me know (I'll check back on Monday). I'm happy to help.
What behaviour do we want instead of throwing an exception in deleteTabValue? Just do nothing if the key doesn't exist?

Yes, of course.

Yes. We'll treat it just like the success case (since it sort of is).

Removed throw statements and fixed old test

Here is my first attempt at a patch. I haven't added any new tests, but have removed some old ones which expected exceptions to be thrown.
Was ithinc suggesting we just have setTabValue(aTab, aKey, "") in the deleteTabValue function, instead of duplicating the code?

(In reply to comment #5)

There are already a few testcases that use deleteTabValue. Do I just pick any one of them to add on to?
Hi Alastair Robertson,

Thanks for your taking. Removing the else branch is enough for me.

Dietrich: I'm ok with getting rid of the throws here (I look at it like removeEventListener which is silent if you pass a listener which isn't listening). But I wanted to check with you since you reviewed the patch in bug 345898 which added them. I can see some small value if passed a window/tab that sessionstore isn't tracking but other than that it seems unnecessary.

Alastair: Removing those is the right first step. The next step would be making sure that calling delete*Value doesn't throw when called for nonexistant values. I think adding to browser_350525.js and just calling delete*Value again after each has been called once should be enough. I think we'll want to keep throwing in some cases, but let's hold off on that until Dietrich responds.

this is ok, f=me. it is a minor behavioral change, so not sure if it's worth marking this bug with the compat keyword.

We'll need to fix the conflicts when bug 658259 lands, but otherwise, it looks great. Thanks a lot Alastair!

I pushed to try server just to make sure and it looks good: http://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=cc2cb6af2cac
Thanks for all your help with this bug Paul :)

Does solving the conflicts involve creating a new patch, or can it be done with what has already been submitted?

No problem. There are always more if you want to keep going ;) (seriously, I have a pile of session restore bugs ripe for the fixing)

Mercurial might handle it ok - it's just some changes in context. If it doesn't, it'll be a small conflict, so I can fix it when I check it in.

Speaking of checking in, since your patch doesn't have author information in there, is the name and email address you're using for bugmail ok? It would look like http://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/a76a300e882b

I'd like to contribute more in the future, so I'll have a look through bugzilla later (unless there were any specific bugs you had in mind).

Yes, that information is fine.
