Created attachment 407018
a demo of the bug
This works for me using - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091018 Minefield/3.7a1pre 

However it is an issue on 3.5 and 3.6. Looks like a dupe of bug 473736 which itself is a dupe.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 148810 ***
Kevin, you say you're seeing this bug in 3.6.  Bug 148810 is fixed in 3.6.  So whatever this bug is it is NOT that bug.
This got accidentally fixed by the patch for bug 521525.  We need to add this testcase to our tests, in case that bug's patch ends up getting backed out...
Pushed test as http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8ab265cb6feb
