As a user, I am able to learn more about content protected by Encrypted Media Extensions - and the limitations it may place on the use of that content - through a link to more information in the CDM listing in the Addons->Plugins page so I can better understand the limitations of protected content, what entities place those limitations on that content, and what alternatives and/or recourse I have.

Implementation will be in bug 1129219.
This feature was implemented in bug 1129219. It landed in Nightly 39 and was uplifted to Aurora 38.
Correction: bug 1129219 has not been uplifted to Aurora 38 yet.
Since this was implemented in bug 1129219 which is marked for verification, I'm marking this issue as qe-verify-.
