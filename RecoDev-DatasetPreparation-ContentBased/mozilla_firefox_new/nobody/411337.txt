When opening and scrolling a page, or switching to a tab in Chinese language, there is a dramatic slowdown and 100% CPU use for a few seconds.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use the link I provided, or search for the English page on Tea on Wikipedia and look for the Chinese language on the left side (should be the language at the very bottom).
2.Open the website and try using PageDown button.
3.Switch to other tabs and move back to the Tea article in Chinese.
Actual Results:  
Switching from the English page on tea to Chinese took me 10 seconds to load the page.  Pressing PageDown freezes the screen for a moment and then displays the scrolled page.

Expected Results:  
In a non-English language like Arabic, French and Russian the wiki page on tea loaded much quicker.

Same problem noticed with Firefox 3 B2 on 64-bit Ubuntu 7.10 and OpenSuSE 10.3.

This bug has been fixed in Firefox 3 Beta 5.  Thanks for the great work!
