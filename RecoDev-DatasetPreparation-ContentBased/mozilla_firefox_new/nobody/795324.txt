- observed in the Orion-1.0 branch
- possibly related to bug 788215, but the symptom is quite different, hence the separate report

Steps:
- view the index.html file in GCLI's root directory
- type "edit " and then down-arrow a few times to select the "css#gcli-menu" completion, press Enter
  -> completes to "edit css#gcli-menu"
- backspace a few times so that you're left with "edit css#gcli-"
  -> note that the blue text in the input area now shows "edit css#gcli-output-view", implying that this value will be inserted if auto-complete is invoked
 (tangent: not sure why this value became the default?)
- press Tab to invoke auto-complete
  -> the value "edit css#gcli-css-display" is inserted instead of what was previously shown in the blue text, presumably because it's the first valid suggestion in the list
