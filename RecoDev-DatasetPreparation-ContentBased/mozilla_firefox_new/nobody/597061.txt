If the web page changes the dynamically the tree panel is not updated, and when the user hovers/selects one of the new deeper nodes that are not displayed in the tree panel .... then InspectorUI.ioBox.select() throws: objectBox is not defined.

The fix is really trivial:

-    if (makeBoxVisible) {
+    if (makeBoxVisible && objectBox) {

This change is included in the patch from bug 566085, which also handles DOM mutations and updates the tree panel as needed.
