Thinking out loud, I expect we'll want:
* a new menu item (New Private Window)
* a new context menu item (Open Link in New Private Window)
* remove Start/Stop Private Browsing menu item
* disallow dragging tabs to windows of a different privacy nature

Things I would like, but need UX feedback:
* keyboard shortcut - I dearly love Ctr+Shift+N for Chrome's Incognito mode, but we currently use that to reopen closed windows. Could it be repurposed?
* visual indicator for private windows - I believe this was nixed in the past, but given that every other major browser has this, it's probably worth considering again

ISTR Steven already has some mockups of what UI changes should be applied in PB mode?

WIP - Add UI for per-window private browsing.

This is just a really simple proof-of-concept I've been using to test out my changes to other components (eg. history). The about:privatebrowsing changes help demonstrate that the window-level API functions - in a non-private window, you'll see the option to start private browsing, while in a private one you'll see a description of what private mode is doing for you.
This is the last mockup ( http://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/20111101-cuttingRoomFloor/stealth-firefox4-full.png ) that I have found, but I think Stephen Horlander may have ones updated on the Australis design.

Currently we change the Firefox button from orange to purple. But that is only on Windows Vista/7 or XP if the user enables it.

Things we have talked about in the past include completely skinning the browser with a dark theme: http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/private-browsing-mode/mockups/australis-pbm.png

Basically a look for "stealth mode". Which would be quite awesome, but would probably be a lot of work and there are always the concerns of whether or not you want to advertise you are in private browsing mode.

Considering impending UI changes I will put some thoughts into a consistent indicator we could use on all platforms.
Has there been any updates on this?

This work is subsumed by lots of other bugs.
Is it? My understanding is that we still wanted a new window styling before shipping per-window PB. Is that work happening in a different bug?
Yeah, that's bug 749394. I didn't notice that this one is acting as a tracking bug, so I'll mark that explicitly.
*** Bug 823683 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 823683 was marked a duplicate of this, but I'm not sure this is the correct bug, especially considering this is a meta bug for UI changes and bug 823683 was not about a UI problem.  

Bug 823683 comment 5 stated that changing the never remember history preference would require a restart, which would negate the problems I'm seeing.  Is that what this bug is for, if not bug 823683 should be attached somewhere else.

I corrected my mistake there.

FWIW this bug has outlived its usefulness, but I have no objection to keep it open until bug 749394 is fixed.
