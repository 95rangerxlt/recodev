Not sure if this is the entire issue, but I see:
[10:01:03.820] Warning: TODO: unsupported text rendering mode: 7 @ http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf:569
Fixed in bug 801280.

The entire second page has a black background and the writing is white; only the image is displayed correctly (see attachment).
Do you want a new bug logged for this issue?
