on www.discogs.com

when I edit whatever (artist profiles, label profiles, releases), all line breaks that are present in the notes or profile fields, are not saved in the result.

There is a preview function when editing, which works allright, and shows everything correct. But when saving or submitting the preview, all returns are removed in the result. Also when I didn't actually touch the fields.

Normal firefox doesn't have this problem, it came with the latest update of minefield

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Press 'edit label' (you need an account there)
2.No change needed, enter at least 4 characters in the submission notes & just press preview
3.press save
4.Follow the link 'Artistique' that appears ("Updated label profile for Artistique")
Actual Results:  
All returns or line breaks are removed, sticking all text together.

(This happens with anything you edit on www.discogs.com)

Expected Results:  
Line breaks that were entered while editing, and that were present before editing should still be present in the final result, as the 'preview' shows them.

Returns in form fields are not saved, resulting in all text glued together
