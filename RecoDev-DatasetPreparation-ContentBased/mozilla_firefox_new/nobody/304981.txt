On any mac in our agency 10.3.9 or 10.4.2 using firefox, one cannot print to the
Xerox Splash G640 Server running a DC12 printer. It worked in all the previous
versions before the Apple Security Update released yesterday. Tried on all our
Adv Agency Macs.. it does not work. On the Phone with EFI/Splash and Xerox for
over 1 hour and they are now aware of the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Program
2.Select Page Setup - Splash G640
3.Select Print 
4.Page to print is sent and Desktop Error #255 is reported each time.
5.Works with all other programs to print but Firefox!

Actual Results:  
Error Reported #255 in Desktop Printer Dialogue box, nothing prints

Expected Results:  
Printed page of actual site I am on.

Please note that Apple also released the Security update yesterday that we
applied to all of our machines, 10.3.9 and 10.4.2.. before this we had no
problems printing with Firefox.
Xerox/EFI came through with a Fix! Should any of you have the same problem.
Xerox Tech Support has a file called "Error255TestPatch" which resolved this
issue! Kudos to them for having this fixed ASAP! Again support via Xerox and EFI
is outstanding.
