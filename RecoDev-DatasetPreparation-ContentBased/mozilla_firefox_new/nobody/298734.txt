I have the file attachment problem using Firefox 1.5.0.3-7 on Suse 10.1. When I try to attach a file (specifically .jpgs), the progress bar just keeps going back and forth, but never ends.

I was not able to duplicate the bug.

From a Yahoo e-mail account, I e-mailed myself at my fit.edu and gmail.com e-mail addresses.  I sent three separate e-mails to each address individually, one containing a Microsoft Word 2003 (.doc) file, one containing a Microsoft Excel 2003 (.xls) file, and one containing a JPG image file.  All files were approximately 50 KB in size.

Although it took some time, all three e-mails reached both accounts without any problems and neither the files nor e-mails showed any signs of corruption.

I was able to duplicate this problem within Linux (Suse 10.1). The progress "lights" just keep flashing back and forth. Nothing ever gets attached.
I am no longer able to produce this problem with Firefox 2.0b2 on Windows XP SP2 (Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/2006082101 Firefox/2.0b2). 

When originally reported, I STRONGLY suspected Yahoo! webmail as the source of the problem. The original problem appeared without any changes to my system. Yahoo Technical Support refused to respond to the problem report. I subsequently reported the issue to Mozilla/Bugzilla when I discovered this problem occurred on the Windows XP platform but DID NOT occur on the Windows 98 platform even though both O/S platforms were using the same version of Firefox.

Since my original report (20060423), Yahoo has made considerable changes to their web mail interface. Today (20060906) I tested the attachment and email process again. I am able to successfully upload MS Word ".doc" and Excel ".xls" attachments. The attachments are emailed to my GMAIL and received complete and intact. 

I consider this issue resolved with Firefox 2.0b2.
