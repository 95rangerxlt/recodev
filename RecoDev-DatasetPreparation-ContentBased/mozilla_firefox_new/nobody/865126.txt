Steps to reproduce:

I made a pdf with itext. I wrote a single png image to the file. The png is a square, with a transparent section, having indexed color space.

I've posted my source code, original png, and resulting pdf here (a broken indexed version and a working rgb version): https://bitbucket.org/djeikyb/firefoxpdfbug/

I tested the pdf using the pdfjs viewer on github.com/mozilla/pdf.js, and it works great.


Actual results:

It displayed wrong and badly.


Expected results:

It should have displayed correctly.

It's broken in FF20 but displayed fine in FF23, so it's already fixed. The stable version of Firefox (20.0.1) doesn't include the latest stable version of pdf.js.
