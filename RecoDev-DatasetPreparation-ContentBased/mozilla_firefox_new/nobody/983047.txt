scheduled for next tuesday
Please see the version number set in the patch is incorrect.
Use 12.1.0.150 instead.
We verified that Shockwave installations are happening properly.

But the version number displayed is still wrong and is not corrected.
Please set version number to 12.1.0.150 instead.
I got your emails, I was just waiting for Tomcat to confirm, but maybe he's on vacation or something.  Anyway, this will go live on Tuesday:

yeah Wil's patch is correct, sorry about the typo in the version number. Also was tight into some priority tasks the last days so the delay of responding


Update PFS for Shockwave 12.1.0.150
