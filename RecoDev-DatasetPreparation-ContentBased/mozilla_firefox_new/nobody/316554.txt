WFM - when I check the box "Remember me on this computer" the password manager appears.
Sorry - please ignore my previous comment.

To clarify...(I know you said to ignore, but anything that helps to clarify is a plus)

The passwords are being saved. However, I have to login to google almost every time I open a new instance of Firefox. Since I have a modified google homepage, this gets to be a nuisance. 

Can you still reproduce it ?
If yes, it would useful if you did a search for "google" in the cookies manager to check the expiration date of these cookies.
