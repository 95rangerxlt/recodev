I've been using Firefox 3 Beta 2 for over a week now, and it seems to me that the popup blocked icon in the lower right portion of the status bar is reporting blocked popups way too freqently, and often for sites that do not have any popups (e.g. my personal blog or even Bugzilla).  Once it shows up, it doesn't go away, but for whatever site I go to, it updates its options so that the current site's URL shows up in the options (e.g. "Allow popups for bugzilla.mozilla.org").

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Visit several websites
3. Notice the popup blocked icon appear in the status bar for a site with no popups
4. Notice that the popup blocked icon does not appear to go away after initially showing up


Expected Results:  
The popup blocked icon should only show up for sites where a popup was legitimately blocked, and should go away when the user navigates to a different page or URL where there is no popup.

I'm using a pretty vanilla install, with ChatZilla and Gmail Notifier being my only installed extensions.

Is there any particular site that consistently causes the icon to appear even though the site has no popups?  When you click the icon, what does the menu display?  And if you select one of the popups listed in the menu (if there are any), what happens?

This looks a lot like bug 402348, which is already fixed on trunk.
Bernie: Can you test whether you still see this in a current nightly build?
Based on my observations, I wouldn't say I agree that this is a dupe of bug 402348, but I have verified that the problem doesn't seem to occur anymore in the latest Firefox nightly:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008012704 Minefield/3.0b3pre

I went to this site:

http://www.popuptest.com/popuptest4.html

And navigated to several other sites afterward, and Minefield seems to now behave as I've come to expect it to.


Blocked popup icon shows up frequently in status bar for sites without any popups
