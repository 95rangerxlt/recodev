Displaying an PDF file with the (X)HTML element OBJECT doesn't show the PDF file. Sometimes it works but after reloading the PDF isn't visible.

Sample code:

<object data="./anyfile.pdf" style="width: 100%; height: 300px;" standby="Loading&nbsp;&hellip;"></object>

I'm working with FF 3.0rc1.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Display an PDF file with the OBJECT elemet
2. The problems happen very often.

Sorry, I forgot: I am using Adobe Reader 8.1.2
The problem seems to be resolved with Adobe Reader 9.0. It's not a problem of Firefox.
