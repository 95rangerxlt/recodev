Instead of checking the service, it should just import PrivateBrowsingUtils.jsm and use PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate on the relevant window object.

This patch basically does the job: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2481  I've commented there on a few things that need to be improved there.
Also see https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2498.
Can I land the patch in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2481 on mozilla-central now that it has landed on pdf.js's master?  We really need this to be fixed on m-c as soon as possible.
The fix(though not your smaller one) will be landed in bug 824174.
Great, thanks!
