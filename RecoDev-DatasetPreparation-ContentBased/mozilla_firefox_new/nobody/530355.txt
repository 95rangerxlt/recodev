We observe domwindowopened & do init(window) in browser.js. I know we bail out if we already track the window, but it seems like we could trim down on the fat and just pick one.

This follows what I did in bug 514490 (I started out tracking windows using domwindowopened, but moved to just tracking in browser.js). That seems like the best way to do it to give us a little tighter integration.

This was fixed by bug 898308.


SessionStore should use a single method to track windows
