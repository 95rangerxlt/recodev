I am a member of SmugMug and like to use their slideshow option to view photos.  It worked great with FF2. Now, with FF3, it does not work. I contacted SmugMug and was told that it worked with their FF3.  However, I did a few things that they suggested.  I reinstalled Flash even though I had the latest plugin, and I emptied all my temporary Internet files and cookies.  It's still not working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to SmugMug.
2.Open a gallery.
3.Choose slideshow as the viewing option.
Actual Results:  
Very brief, for a fraction of a second, there was an animated "loading" bar in the middle of the screen, then nothing.  No photo loaded, and when I tried to use the advance arrow to advance to the next photo (even though there were none), nothing happened.

Expected Results:  
As soon as I chose slideshow as my viewing option, the first picture in the gallery should have loaded.  Arrows to advance should have worked.

It works fine for me.

with
Flash 9.0 r124

Which version of Flash are you running? (tools->addons->plugins)

For anyone who needs a sample SmugMug gallery to test:

Works fine under XP:

Also Flash 9.1 r124
The first thing I did was check the version of Flash I had.  It was up to date, the most recent. I checked at work today, where I am also using FF3 and the Flash feature in SmugMug did not work there either.  I then tried disabling AdBlock Plus.  With AdBlock Plus disabled, the Flash feature in the SmugMug slideshow works fine.  However, now I don't know how to change anything in AdBlock in order to get everything well.  I don't want to have to disable it every time I use SmugMug.
I added @@http://*.smugmug.com to Adblock's whitelist and now the Flash slideshow feature in SmugMug is working fine. 


Flash does not work in SmugMug
