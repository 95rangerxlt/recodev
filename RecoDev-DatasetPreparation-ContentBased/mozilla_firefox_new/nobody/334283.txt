Renaming or deleting localstore.rdf in your profile might help.

I have also got my bookmarks toolbar unusable, but the deletion of localstore.rdf  file did not solve my problem, in spite I have erased this file with all of its redundancy. 

Also after a complete erase / reinstall process I could get it to work for only until a restart.


bookmarks toolbar does not work with newest firefox
