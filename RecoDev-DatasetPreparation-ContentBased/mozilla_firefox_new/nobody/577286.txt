I have been developing a web application that consists of fixed content areas. During my browser compatibility tests i found that firefox flickered badly when scrolling. IE7 - IE8, Chrome, Safari, and even Opera worked :s

Also <input />'s of type text and password do not support line-height

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a page with a fixed header/menu bar that contains a background image.
2. Add content so that you can scroll the page.
3. Watch the flicker happen!
