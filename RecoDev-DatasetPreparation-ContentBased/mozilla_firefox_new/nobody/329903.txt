This morning I got surprised by a crash on startup and it turned out to be the Right Encoding extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=371&application=firefox
This extension adds the contents of View -> Character Encoding to the rightclick menu as I need frequently to switch between Western (ISO-8859-1) and Unicode (UTF-8).

Regression range: 1.9a1_2006030803 - 1.9a1_2006030813.

Maybe regression from bug 329335?

Neil, do you think this could be a regression from bug 329335? (sorry, I have no idea how to make a minimised testcase)
Could be, although a fix for a crash was made in bug 329884, could be the same one here
Ok, let's see if this is fixed in tomorrow's build.
Ria, do you still crash on startup with the Right Encoding extenion with today's trunk build?

No, not anymore. Thanks. Think I can close it now. Fixed by bug 329884 I think.
