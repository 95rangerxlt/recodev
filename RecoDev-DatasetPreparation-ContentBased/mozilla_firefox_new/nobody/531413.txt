The runtime predependencies as specified in the file
README.install with recent released IBM's Firefox 3.0.7
breaks compatibility with Seamonkey builds.
Reason: forgotten 32bit shared members in the updated GNOME 2.16 runtime libs.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.0.7 from IBM's website including all predepencies
2. Install Seamonkey 1.1.18 from http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/1.1.18#contrib
3. Try to start /opt/seamonkey/seamonkey
Actual Results:  
Seamonkey does not find pango, glib2 and other shared libs.

Expected Results:  
Both working together, not breaking compatibility

Using the GNOME 2.16.1 RPMS from www.bullfreeware.com or www.perzl.org/aix will keep binary compatibility
as they contain both 32- and 64bit shared lib members.
