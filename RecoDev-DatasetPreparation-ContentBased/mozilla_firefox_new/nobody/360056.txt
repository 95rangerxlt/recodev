Other involved url is:

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/526/ (small_screen_renderer-1.1-fx.xpi)

When visiting the http://disruptive-innovations.com/products/index.html and when trying a manual install, I also crashed:

TB25731595
TB25731491
TB25731420
(Stack signature could be related to bug 252187)

My attempts to install ssr-1.2.xpi comes from an email exchange I got with Doug Turner and fantasai on developing a CSS stylesheet for handheld for mozilla.org webpages (see bug 355468 comment #24).

Mr Glazman, if you could upgrade your Small Screen Rendering xpi to work with Firefox 2.x and update both webpages 
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/526/ 
http://disruptive-innovations.com/products/index.html
accordingly, that would be a wonderful, very generous and great gesture on your part.

A hack workaround:

1/ Download the XPI file on disruptive-innovations.com to your local disk
2/ Open it in your favourite Zip file manager (7-zip for me)
3/ Edit the install.rdf file, changing the <em:maxVersion> to 2.0.0.*
4/ From Firefox open the local XPI file and install the extension as normal

Appears to work fine for me (although I only use it for specific types of pages).  Obviously not ideal but if you want SSR in 2.0 this might be your best bet.
> 3/ Edit the install.rdf file, changing the <em:maxVersion> to 2.0.0.*

I get/see
<maxVersion> at line 20
and not
<em:maxVersion>

I have tested it and, as far as I can say/see, it works!! Many thanks, Paschal: this is really appreciated! :)

Doug, have a look at minimo's project page with ssr-1.2 modified for Firefox 2:

Daniel released an update for Firefox 2.
