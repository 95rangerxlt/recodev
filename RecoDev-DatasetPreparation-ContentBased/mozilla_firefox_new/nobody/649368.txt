It's worse (imo) with a darker desktop background color: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v444/KWierso/taskbaricons.png

Slight glow

The smaller sizes are still unrefined but a slight edge glow could alleviate this problem.
yes, this can be tweaked when it is pixel refined. hasn't had the detail love yet.
Sean: my thoughts on pixel refinement:

* Eliminate the highlight at the top of the globe: I actually think this makes the overall icon look too dark by contrast, and doesn't work very well

* Darken the lights on the globe: again, the contrast seems awkward

* Desaturate a bit: I think this will lighten it up enough to eliminate the complaints; in smaller form, should look more like a dark greyish-blue shadow then a blackish-blue one.

New XP icons also need some love

Maybe change the scope of this bug from Windows 7 to all platforms?

> Maybe change the scope of this bug from Windows 7 to all platforms?
I don't think it's scoped to just Windows 7 (the platform field is almost never actually looked at, fwiw)
It's Windows 7 because it autodetected that based on my UA when I filed the bug.
I've also noticed this as an issue for the about:home favicon on Windows... The rest of the browser chrome is very light gray, so the dark blue/black circle for the favicon really jumps out more that it should.

Also, please make an version as an animated PNG where the lights twinkle.

(I kid. Mostly. ;)
I'm going to close this as the new refreshed nightly icon solves this! :)


Nightly taskbar icon is too dark
