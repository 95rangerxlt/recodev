In bug 988335, the server actors have been migrated to Promise.jsm to simplify the conversion of protocol.js. Once that file is converted, it will not be necessary to import Promise.jsm locally anymore.

These days all the debugger server actors are SDK modules to which we provide promise as a built-in global, so we no longer import Promise.jsm there. I think its safe to mark this bug as fixed.


Remove imports of Promise.jsm from the devtools server actors once protocol.js has been migrated
