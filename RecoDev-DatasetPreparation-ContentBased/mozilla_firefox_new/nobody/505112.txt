Hi, 

A slight problem I have noticed after upgrading to Firefox 3.5:
When I open Firefox, the window appears and loads homepage (google) as I would expect. However the window loses focus after a few milliseconds and then Firefox is no longer the active window. This then means that I have to click on the firefox window to make it become active.

The problem becomes weirder if I already have an instance of firefox open and then try to open another instance of firefox (either by clicking File>NewWindow, pressing CRTL+N, or by clicking a shortcut to the program on my desktop or start menu). If I try to open a new instance, it opens, loads google, and then instantaneously flips the focus back to the original instance of FF. Weird!


This may seem like a trivial glitch but it is irritating when I open Firefox and my cursor is not in the search for Google, which is usually what I open FF for in a hurry.

Any ideas?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Ensure no instances of Firefox running
2.Open Firefox and wait for it to load homepage
3.Notice that FF loses focus

OR

1.Open an instance of firefox and wait for it to load
2.Go to a different website and wait for it to load
3.Open another instance of Firefox
4.Watch as it loads momentarily, then switches focus back to 1st instance
