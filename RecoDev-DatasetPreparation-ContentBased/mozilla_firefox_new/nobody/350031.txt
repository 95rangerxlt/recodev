Reducing dependency bugmail for everybody a bit and un-CC-ing firefoxl10n.

Oops, wrong bug ;-), but you closed the right one, too. -> REOPEN.
Sorry.. I was going back/forward around several bugs... at the end I got the wrong one.
Firefox 2 is out the door, the remaining locales go by individual trackers for minor releases.

FIXED :-)


Ship localized Firefox 2
