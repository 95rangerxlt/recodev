Forgot a step. With Inspector enabled, focus/select on a separate field, and then try focusing/selecting back in the name field. In that case, one is unable to focus back to type in the name field.
It seems to me that perhaps you shouldn't be able to type into any fields while using the Inspector.
Looks like this was fixed by bug 642471


[Inspector] Unable to return focus to form elements when another element is selected
