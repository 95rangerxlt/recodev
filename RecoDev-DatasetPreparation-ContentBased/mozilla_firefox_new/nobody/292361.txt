And does it work if you drag and drop the theme file form the explorer to Firefox ?

No, I cannot drag&drop it to the window, it simply won't install then.
It shows the "Can't" cursor.
 I also have the same problem with firefox when attempting to install a theme:

Here is what happened:
1. Attempted to install any theme, and then it attempted to display the jar file
on the screen in ASCII.

2. I shut down firefox and restarted it.

3. Attempted to install same themes, this time the jar file was downloaded, and
the downloader attempted to just open the jar file as a java application.

WinXP :: Firefox 1.0.4

Hope this helps!

Themes installing now works for me. 1.0.4 allowed me to drag-and-drop.
