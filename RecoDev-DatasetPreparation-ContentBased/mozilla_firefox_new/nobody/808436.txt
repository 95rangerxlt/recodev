Maybe you can add one? Up to you.
Optimizer: Are you planning on adding a test as per Paul's comment?
Sorry, I was unable to respond earlier due to MozCamp and vacations.

Currently, I am not sure about what kind of testing is required, or is it feasible. I suppose for the test, I first need to set the dir pref , create a dir, create some dummy files containing commands, test the commands, change the commands, do the refresh and test again and finally do cleanup ?
I see, creating tests for this command would be impractical. This fixes an important bug so marking for landing.
