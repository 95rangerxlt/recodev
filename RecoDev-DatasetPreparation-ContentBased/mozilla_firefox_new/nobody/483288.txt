We need to add kk to browser/locales/all-locales, on both 1.9.1 and central.
For now, I only added kk to the 3.1 builds, which is what we're currently work on. We should probably do a mass-push to central at some point down the road and then switch on the central builds.

Marking FIXED as we got the essential stuff done.


Add kk to the Firefox build
