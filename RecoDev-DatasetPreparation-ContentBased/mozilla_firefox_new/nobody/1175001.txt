If I click on that Learn More link in Nightly, it currently goes to:
https://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/42.0a1/Darwin/en-US/tracking-protection-pbm

So... I *believe* the URL we want to use is
https://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/%VERSION%/%OS%/%LOCALE%/tracking-protection-pbm

Can you create a page at the right location? I'll start a google document with the draft copy in it.

#3 will link to the new TP in PBM SUMO page
Sure, Javaun. We have a tracking protection article that Monica started a while back: https://support.mozilla.org/kb/tracking-protection-firefox

Should we repurpose it? I've set up the link in comment #1 to point to it, but if we need a separate article, I'll change the redirect.
Thanks Joni. I was originally thinking of this a new, separate SUMO page, but let's leave it the way you did it and point to the existing one for now. I'm not sure what the structure will end up being, let's see where we land when we write it.

The existing documentation refers to the experimental TP that you enabled/disabled by going into about:config. It runs in all modes. The new version will only run in PBM, has some different capabilities, and is enabled/disabled by a UI checkbox under Preferences > Privacy.
Hi folks, Mark hasn't gotten a chance to start,he's slammed. Let's do this. 

Let's publish the new page, with this text, today:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wOiWzj1d1uL7azdq8ALIOlNt0MzoNPXLER5W7NEBUn0/edit#heading=h.greesoj92qtq

This page above goes into the new URL we discuss in comment 1.

https://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/%VERSION%/%OS%/%LOCALE%/tracking-protection-pbm

Joni, that URL above is what we use in product and it currently redirects to the old TP page. Let's remove the redirect after we publish the page text I have in the Gdoc above. 

This goes live to DevEd tomorrow, so I'd like to do this today.
Hi Javaun,

The new article is up and that link is now pointing to it. Thanks for providing the content!
