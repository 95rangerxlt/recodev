For FF38 we'll be deploying a Reading List First Time Use Tour (FTU).

The current wireframes (bug 1129536) detail entries into the first time use tour which include a Reading List entry.

This bug is requesting the insertion of a URL into the Reading List that will be included with all instances of FF38.

Note the locale redirection on bedrock goes: m.o/example (301) m.o/en-US/example

Questions:

# Do you need anything other than a URL (without locale) to get this done?
# Will the translated <title> tag be displayed in the user's sidebar?
# When will we have to give you the URL?

Thanks

Just the URL should work.

> # Will the translated <title> tag be displayed in the user's sidebar?

NI: Dolske to help answer these.

My assumption is that Fx will reach out to grab meta data about the page and during that time should get the correct page through the redirect.  Dolske, am I too hopeful?

> # When will we have to give you the URL?

The sooner the better.  Perhaps we can use an allizom link during the Nightly->Aurora cycles and we could uplift the real links later on.

Dolske, what do you think?

bug 1132988 is tracking the SUMO articles that will also be default entries; it might be good to keep an eye on that too.

I presume we'll tell Firefox to a URL like https://mozilla.org/%LOCALE/whatever.html, which we'll format with the user's actual locale before actually adding it to the reading list. So when the usual metadata collection kicks in, it would fetch the translated version.

Would probably be good to at least have a placeholder URL in the short term. The actual content shouldn't be critical.
We've decided on the URL for the reading list.

It will be:

https://www.mozilla.org/%LOCALE/firefox/reading/start/?utm_source=firefox-browser&utm_medium=firefox-browser

:garethc - will you please review the parameters here? Ref UX bug 1129536
Looks good to me.
URL defined. Closing this bug.

Note there's a missing `%` here after `%LOCALE`. Should be `%LOCALE%`

Thanks Alex - updated the attachment
I suggest to drop the %LOCALE% from the URL and to rely on server-side language negotiation.

We can work with either.

On bedrock

https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/reading/start/

redirects to

https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/reading/start/

Comment 3 suggested including the %LOCALE% in the URL.
dolske, does it matter to you if we drop the %LOCALE% from the url?
Nope, I'm happy to do whatever L10N prefers.

I'm a little confused as to which is the "right" way -- seems like we're using a mix.

Looks like 1136570 hasn't yet added the URLs to the default list, but we can add it sans-%LOCALE% when it does.
