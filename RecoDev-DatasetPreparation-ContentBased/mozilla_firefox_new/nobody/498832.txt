When executing litmus test 5984 I encountered a polish issue on Windows with the toolbar button sizes.  After creating a new toolbar and adding a new button (ie. new tab) to it, the height of the toolbar increases so much so that the buttons added to it are larger than the buttons on the navigation toolbar.

When executing litmus test 5984 I encountered a polish issue on Windows with the toolbar button sizes.  After creating a new toolbar and adding a new button (ie. new tab) to it, the height of the toolbar increases so much so that the buttons added to it are larger than the buttons on the navigation toolbar.
After further investigation, it seems like the actual dimensions of the buttons are the same but some icons such as 'bookmarks' and 'paste' have larger images.
