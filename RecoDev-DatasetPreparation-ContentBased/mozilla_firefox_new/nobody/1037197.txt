hi Gomita, if you have any questions about add-on support for multiprocess Firefox (e10s), just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
This bug has been fixed in the latest development version of Tab Scope, 1.6b2.

Yupe! it's working for me now :)
Awesome! Thanks, Gomita. Let's keep this bug open until Tab Scope 1.6 is available on AMO.
The new version is now available on AMO.

Yes. I'd like to close this bug. How can I do?
