We are going to first deploy the newtab page in the Content Services AWS IAM.

This tracks the automation that needs to be built for the deployment in this IAM's S3 bucket.

The services team will be provided hostnames to point a CNAME to from this IAM.

We are going to first deploy the newtab page in the Content Services AWS IAM.

This tracks the automation that needs to be built for the deployment in this IAM's S3 bucket.

The services team will be provided hostnames to point a CNAME to from this IAM.
To be clear, this bug includes the automation for:
* the l10n build of the static files
* deployment to s3

The CNAME setting will not be tracked in this bug
The initial static pages won't have any localization and will have a lot of duplication.

The final build is tracked in bug 1186121
Example deployed page: https://newtab.cdn.mozilla.net/v0/aurora/en-US/index.html
all 16224 files for the initial landing are deployed
