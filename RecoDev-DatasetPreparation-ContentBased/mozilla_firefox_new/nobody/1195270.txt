This is the implementation bug for the design in bug 1192625.
There's a quite interesting potential accessibility issue with this design and I couldn't find a good way to solve it, or a confirmation it is actually an issue.

In attachment 8647668, look at the table layout in the left section:

Forget-header  Keep-header
Forget-list    Keep-list

The Forget-header and the Keep-header should have the same height so that the start of Forget-list and Keep-list are aligned. At the same time Keep-header and Keep-list must be aligned. The only way I found to do this was to use a table element, or a similar technique, for which the order of the cells in the source file would now be:

Forget-header
Keep-header
Forget-list
Keep-list

I'm not sure if screen readers would handle this correctly. The ideal reading order would be:

Forget-header
Forget-list
Keep-header
Keep-list

Tim, any idea whom we could ask?

I've confirmed locally that NVDA reads these in the correct order.

Note: it's pretty easy to test screenreader support by downloading and running NVDA: http://www.nvaccess.org/download/.  Note that it's Windows only.
