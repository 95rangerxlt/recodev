While working on bug 333618 on the 1.8 branch, I ran into an issue where nsIFeedProgressListener makes use of the interface nsIEntry.  But there is no mention of this interface anywhere else in the tree.  From reading bug 325080, it looks like this should have been changed to nsIFeedEntry.  Patch to follow.
