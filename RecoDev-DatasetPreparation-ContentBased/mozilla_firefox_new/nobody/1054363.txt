When will this be ready for testing on gum/aurora/dev-edition?

This can already be tested since the adapter we use to connect firefox to webkit/blink is an addon.

- open WebIDE in dev-edition
- go to View/Manage add-ons
- from the list, you can install "Tools adapter add-on"
This will install the latest version of the addon.

The thing is we haven't updated the latest version for a while so it might not be worth testing as is since a lot of things got fixed lately.

One way to install the latest is to follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/campd/fxdt-adapters
Another way is to install the xpi I'll attach to this bug in a minute.

jryans, the latest release on https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxdt-adapters/mac64/ is 15 days old, could you release a new version?
Once installed (I think firefox might need to be restarted):
- connect an apple device via USB
- start Safari on the device
- open WebIDE
- in the "Select Runtime" menu, choose Safari on iOS
- in the "Open App" menu, in the "Tabs" section, choose the url currently opened in safari

This should open the devtools toolbox for this tab.

I have now released a new 0.1.0 build of the add-on.

If you've installed Patrick's attachment already, just be aware that only release builds are able to be updated, so if you want that, you will need to reinstall.
Jeff, can this bug now be considered FIXED?

Valence exists.  It is unclear what exactly is sufficient to call this bug completed.

It is already possible to test on Dev Edition today.  The only thing that is not done is enabling the add-on to install automatically when WebIDE is opened.  This will happen in bug 1082584 just before Dev Edition release, so you'd need to manually install from WebIDE's "Manage Simulators" or set the pref "devtools.webide.autoinstallFxdtAdapters" to true before opening WebIDE.
True, this works. Marking fixed, as the current Gum builds automagically install the adapter add-on and allow you to connect to webkit / blink browsers running on devices.


connect to webkit & blink browsers
