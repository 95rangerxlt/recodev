We should show a message in the timeline panel "Timeline not supported for this runtime". And make sure to avoid all these exceptions in the jsconsole ("gFront undefined").

Should we still support the tool itself, just show a message if the target isn't supported? Wouldn't it be more in line to just not have the panel itself supported within the toolbox for the target?

A message could be used within the performance tab once we have timeline moved in there, but for overall support, I think this should just be a toolbox setting.

Yeah, I would say the tool should just not appear at all, as with other tools when they don't support a target.

Fail gracefully if the target doesn't have a timeline actor
