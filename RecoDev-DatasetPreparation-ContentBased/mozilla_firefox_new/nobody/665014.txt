The selection end seems to be fixed to the bottom of the page.
Marked as blocking GCLI-HELP because it's really annoying, but I've not checked if this affects the FF integration.

Workaround found:

    // Commenting this out is a quick workaround for bug 653140 but it probably
    // breaks the popup mechanism, however for now selection is more important
    // that popup.
    // this.element.addEventListener('mousedown', this.preventBlur, true);

See changeset c80dc66
Moving to block GCLI-FUTURE because we have a workaround


Selecting text in the GCLI output area is broken
