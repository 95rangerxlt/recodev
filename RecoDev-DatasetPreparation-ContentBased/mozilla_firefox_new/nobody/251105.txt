This page is supposed to smoothly scroll multiple layers of transparent GIF div 
elements. It worked properly in Firefox 0.8 and Internet Explorer 6.

In Firefox 0.92 it is horribly slow, but functional. Can you tell me if there 
is any way to work around this? It's a major bummer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the page in firefox 0.92. note the slowness.
2. try it again in firefox 0.8. much faster, eh?
Actual Results:  
the page runs slowly.

Expected Results:  
the page should run at least as fast as it did in firefox 0.8...

can you please contact me regarding this? i don't know what to do to fix my 
page in 0.92!

Reporter,

the link you provided does not work anymore. Could you provide a new url?
The url testcase is slow for me in Mozilla1.7, but quite fast/normal in the
latest Firefox trunk build.
I think this is WORKSFORME.
Possibly fixed by bug 284716. 
Works equally for me across browsers.

CPU usage spikes at 100% with this, so I think this is a question of hardware and not of software.
Opera 9.60 doesn't give an cpu usage spikes for me at all with the testcase, so it seems to me that Firefox still could do a lot better here.
My other PC with a more modern Core 2 Duo reaches about 70% with bot, Opera 9.6 and Firefox 3. Firefox' animation is more smooth though.
Wow, I filed this more than four years ago. I'm pretty sure it is fixed now though. I was able to produce the problem in both Windows and Linux, and then mysteriously the problem stopped happening after one of the patches. Whatever was broken in 0.9.2 has long since been fixed...

I would agree with closing this one. Thanks guys.


unreasonable slowdown with javascript animation of transparent gif DIV layers

perf, testcase
