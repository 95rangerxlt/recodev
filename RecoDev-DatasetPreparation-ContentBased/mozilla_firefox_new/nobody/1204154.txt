Patch v.1

JAR manifests (as I understand them!) don't need to specify the source file when it's in the same location as the manifest, and the same name as we want to ship it. In other words, a line like

  skin/classic/browser/browser.css       (browser.css)

can simply be

  skin/classic/browser/browser.css

I think the former form has been frequently cargo-culted, and we can make the manifests a bit nicer by removing the duplication.
