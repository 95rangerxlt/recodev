I tested it on Ff 3b5 running on Ubuntu and it works fine. That's also the case with older versions of Firefox on both Windows and Linux.

I also get the following message in the error console:
Warning: Unknown property 'zoom'.  Declaration dropped.

The same problem occurs in Firefox 3 RC 1
Unless you can identify what is broken, not going to block final on this.  It could be bad assumptions around keypress, but there's no errors, and the code is hard to read, so not going to block unless there's something more concrete about why this isn't working.
Still there on Firefox 3 final.

Initially suspecting that it was a problem on Google's end with bad user agent detection, I tried using the user agent switcher extension to plug in the user agent from a linux version of firefox where it does work, but that produced no change in behavior.

This makes me suspect that the real problem is that firefox isn't letting the web page bind the -/=/+ keys as hotkeys.  Is there a way I can check that?  I've noticed google reader has issues not getting to see certain hotkeys for other things sometimes too, though the zoom ones it never sees.

Google fixed this recently.
