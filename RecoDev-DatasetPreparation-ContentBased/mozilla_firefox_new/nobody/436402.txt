Alignment and style issues in the Windows bookmark contextual dialog:

-all fields should be the same height (tags is currently shorter than the other two)

-there should be considerably more space under "remove bookmark" so that it visually maps to the top section, instead of everything being crammed together

-"Edit Bookmark" the remove bookmark button, and the fields should be left aligned

-There should be consistent padding on all sides of the dialog (left, right, top, bottom).

-Use the new icons for progressive disclosure controls (bug 430902)

-Change all buttons to be 16 pixels tall with a 10 point font, but only if we can override this if the user has a non-default font size

Alignment in the German panel

This might be a constraint due to the localizability of the labels below the star. Using min-width, this could work for the English locale, but might continue to be off for locales with longer words (as this German one).

This seems to have made things worse rather than better...

use trunk to compare the panels, branch is far behind

Is there any other bug about making the New Bookmark panel look good on _branch_ (which we'll ship our next release from)? Or one which still needs branch landing?

Bug 413053 is waiting for approval.
This should be fixed by bug 413053 and bug 484022. Please file new bugs if something is left.
From comment 0 point 4 about consistent padding on all sides of the dialog still needs fixing on Vista/Win 7 but seems to WFM on XP. Is there a bug # for it?

Also should this bug depend on bug 485499?

OK filed Bug 491838 on the equal padding issue. In vista the bottom margin in particular looks to small.
This bug's priority relative to the set of other polish bugs is:
P2 - Polish issue that is in a secondary interface, occasionally encountered, and is easily identifiable.
