The style inspector's left column should auto-fit it's contents. The contents of the right-column should wrap as on small screens values are not always visible.

Mihai created a patch for this in another bug but because of bug 460637 we could not use it. If the patch now works we will use it ... otherwise it would make a great test case for bug 460637.

Wow, that took longer than expected partly because of changes that we had made to the code, partly due to xul quirks and partly because I am sick and my brain is in standby mode this week.

I have updated the patch and removed a lot of cruft from the css files. I have also logged bug 705276 to separate content & document css.

This bug does raise the "invalid BC damage area" assertion which in turn logs hundreds of stack traces. This slows the test seriously enough to make it time out and fail so I will explain how to reproduce it in bug 460637 so that it can be fixed.

Joe, can you look over the css and make sure I am not unnecessarily breaking any Daoist rules?

I can only give feedback right now, so f+ nor r+. I'm assuming that the padding:0's are either needed or will be removed.
Dao will need to take a look.

Minor, not something I would demand you go an change everywhere, but classList rocks imho.

Do we actually need this? Isn't it the default?
Michael, if you see still the assert once bug 460637 is fixed please file a bug and CC me.

I agree but this is how it has been done in this section of the code so I chose not to change it.

It is not the default and we do need it.

Thanks for the feedback.

Dão, can you review this as it is all style related?

This seems to regress the expander styling, i.e. they expanders are cut off again... Tested on Ubuntu 11.10.
