Bookmarks not working on BeOs builds Neither the Bookmarks menu button nor the
Bookmarks manager show any bookmarks, even the default firebird ones. Also,
clicking on "Add to Bookmarks" does nothing.

I realize that BeOS is not yet supported, but reporting anyways.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the Bookmarks menu botton.
2. Click on Bookmarks->Manage Bookmarks


Actual Results:  
no bookmarks are shown in both cases

Expected Results:  
A list on bookmarks should be shown

I don't have a BeOS build, then setting the assignee to nobody. However, I
encourage everyone to fix it.
I guess it would help if people had acess to a BeOS build for testing. The build
for which this bug was filed can be found at the following link:

http://pryan.org/firebird/disreali/MozillaFirebird-i586-pc-beos-20031114.zip

Again, this is specific to Firebird. Bookmarks work great in the AppSuite.
.
You said that you need help of a JS/XML programmer to fix bookmarks.
I however don't think that this is a JS/XML issue as the code is exactly the
same on all other platforms and there everything is working.

I had a quick look through the files and didn't notice anything
platform-specific which might cause this failure.
JS/XML/XUL shouldn't be the reason for a crash-bug anyway.
There seems to be a java-script exception in the init-function which may have to
do with this error.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/bookmarks/content/bookmarks.js#77

Firebird does however not tell me in which line exactly the error happens.

Comparing the function with the one from Mozilla I can not find any difference
except for some try/catch-blocks.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/components/bookmarks/resources/bookmarks.js#76

Considering the error message the exception gives me the error could be in line 110:

WINDOWSVC = components.classes[kWINDOWContractID].getService(kWINDOWIID);

may it be that this function is not implementet properly on the beos-port?
Ok, I've investigated a bit further into this problem.
It's not, as I previously reported, the WINDOWSVC line, but seems to be a
problem with the drag&drop implementation.

As a workaround you can just try to uncomment the following line:
DS                = Components.classes[kDSContractID].getService(kDSIID);
(http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/bookmarks/content/bookmarks.js#114)

I'll try to take a closer look at where the problem lies exactly but we are now
leaving the XUL/JS territory and I have not too much knowledge of how mozilla
handles the JS/C++ interface or the general mozilla code structure, so please
bear with me. Any help is greatly appreciated ;) 

Next thing to look at is probably
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/js/src/xpconnect/src/xpcjsid.cpp#815
as this seems to be the function which throws the error.
Daniel, did you try it with "non-optimized"/"non-stripped" FB build?
There is issue with BeOS gcc compiler and optimization flags "deeper" than -O1.
It causes several bugs in nsCOMPtr behaviour, in best case non-opening URL
autokomplete drop-down, and who knows in worst.

I'm asking it because Decaf usually compiles his builds with several
optimization tricks, but if you use builds done in YT, ask them mozconfig file
to look at optimize flags
Is this bug still present in unpatched builds? If not, it should probably be
marked as invalid.
It's present. It will probably will until we can implement drag'n'drop. It will
probably be here RSN(tm). I just need to get embedding drawing, and finishing my
nsAppShell changes, and the NativeAppSupport and...

Oh well, it's in the TODO list.

Workaround - disables drag and drop

I added this one to this bug, to keep track of all the patches I need to apply
to have a fixed firefox. This is the workaround that disables drag and drop,
but it is unfit to put into the mainline, as it will affect any firefox build.

Doesn't this bug depend on 104729?
Yes it does.
This wasn't working before as we had no DND. Since today, bug 104729, we have,
so closing.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
