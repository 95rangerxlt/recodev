The new hosue icon looks like a shed.  It is too short, maybe even too narrow...and no door or windows.

The icon was recently re-added to the nightly builds.  It then changed to this shed-looking one.

IMO, there was no need to change it.  The old one was fine.
IMHO the Home button from previous beta (with brown roof) was perfect - simple and refined. Now it looks absolutely alien on navigation toolbar. It's too bright (making it hardly visible on default light-grey background) and actually "looks like a shed" in small icons mode.

The Home button seemed to be liked by everyone until now. Why change it at all?
This should be fixed by Bug 429689 when the new icons land.

I guess I'll consider this as fixed due to it at least having a door.  Anyone want to resolve this?
