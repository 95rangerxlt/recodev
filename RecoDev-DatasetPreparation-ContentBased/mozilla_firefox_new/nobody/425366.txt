An extension that is running in Firefox is probably broken.

Did you try safe-mode? http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_Mode_(Firefox)
If the problem is gone in safe-mode then something might be running from your application directory. In that case first remove the Mozilla Firefox folder (right-click -> delete) and then reinstall Firefox.

Did the safe mode, and clicked disable all add-ons. clicked make changes and restart.

Firefox now appears normal.

Manually enabled all add-ons. restarted firefox. Firefox still appears normal.

Thanks for you help.
