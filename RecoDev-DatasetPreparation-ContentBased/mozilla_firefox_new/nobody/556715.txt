Combining diacritics and Monospace fonts with OpenType features are broken in input textarea.

For example the words : "mbɔ́tɛ́" <U+006D U+0062 U+0254 U+0301 U+0074 U+025B U+0301> and "mótò" <U+006D U+006F U+0301 U+0074 U+006F U+0300F2> have different behaviours (in both cases, the accents should be on top of the vowels, not after or on the following letter). This seems to be only broken with Firefox (in textarea) and not other apps using Pango (like Gedit).



Reproducible: Always

This seems to be due to the ordering of aliases for 'monospace' in Ubuntu's fontconfig files.
Bitstream Vera, which doesn't have diacritics nor OpenType features has priority over DejaVu Sans Mono, which does. So the diacritics are coming from another font than the default one and OpenType features aren't applied correctly.

I'm considering closing the bug, since it's not directly Firefox's problem, but this is still a problem that could be fixed within Firefox, i.e. basecharacters should be selected from the same font as combining characters from fallback fonts.
Reporter, are you still seeing this issue with Firefox 3.6.13 or later in safe mode? If not, please close. These links can help you in your testing.

You can also try to reproduce in Firefox 4 Beta 8 or later, there are many improvements in the new version, http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html
This is seems to be working with the alias monospace in 3.6.14pre.
Closing the bug.
