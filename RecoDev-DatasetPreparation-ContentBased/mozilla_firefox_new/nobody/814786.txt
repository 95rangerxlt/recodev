Build ID: 20121121030712

Steps to reproduce:

Visit a site that will prompt you with a Notification icon in the URLbar. The plugins.click_to_play feature gives the cleanest examples, as it presents no messages until clicked.


Actual results:

Clicking the Notification icon in the URLbar removes domain highlighting from the current URL. It is not reinstated once the notification has been closed.


Expected results:

Domain highlighting should be unaffected.
