If i save my mailadress and my password for googlemail in the passwordmanager, i am not able to use my second googlemail account.
i updated to ff3.5.2 today, and now, the password manager writes my complete saved mailadress in the folder, when i open the googlemail page. so far so good, but since i upadated firefox, i am not longer able to change the mail adress, to enter my other googlemail account. The folder of the mailadress is closed and i am not able to write anything in that. I am only able to change my password in the password folder, the mailadress folder does not longer exist and i am not able to change the login-adress.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to mail.google.com
2. Enter Login and Password
3. Save it in the Password Manager
4. Log-out and enter mail.google.com again.
Actual Results:  
My mailadress ist set in the Login-Folder and the folder is closed. There is no chance to change anything.

Expected Results:  
Instead of that, the Software should set my mailadress in the Login-folder, but i must be able to change the mailadress, to enter another googlemailaccount!
