Some SWFs use LZMA compression, see:

Tobias says LZMA is only used by newer Flex apps.
LZMA can be used by any Flash SWF since version 11; not directly related to Flex.

Is it just available in IDE publish settings or widely used by flash developers, games and ads networks?
I would guess primarily in publish settings.
By that I mean that I do not know the percentage of published SWFs using LZMA, though I don't think it's insignificant at least for games. However, using the LZMA functions manually outside of publishing seems less likely.

Implement LZMA decompression.
