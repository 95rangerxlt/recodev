User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150127004030

Steps to reproduce:

Installed today's build earlier. Was trying to debug a JS problem. Had inserted various console.log(...) statements in the code. But Web console did not show anything. Problem was not there in previous build.


Actual results:

No output on the web console. Manually typed console.log() statements within the web console seem to work though.


Expected results:

Web console.log should show the console.log output from the webapp's code.

Can you provide links to the page that exhibits this problem? We can't fix this if we are not able to reproduce it.
Must've been a glitch that was resolved already. Doesn't happen anymore. Console logging is back to normal.
So nvm. :D
