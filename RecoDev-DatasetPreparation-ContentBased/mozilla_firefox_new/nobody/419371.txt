Street View will not load in google maps. I have tried clicking street view prior to selecting an address with the same results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load google maps
2. Type in an address
3. Click 'Street View'
Actual Results:  
FF gets stuck on 'retrieving data' and never loads street view

Expected Results:  
loaded the street view box.

I was using all default settings and themes.

This sounds like bug #407953 (which was fixed by the patch in bug #395983). Can you please try a recent (post 2008-02-20) nightly build and update the bug to say if the problem still occurs?
Today's nightly build has the bug fixed. My bad, I'm new to the feedback system and hadn't found the nightly builds yet. Thanks for all your hard work, everyone!
