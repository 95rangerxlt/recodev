As we had l10n-impact changes after Beta 1, we need to go through a host of updates for l10n-changesets_mozilla-1.9.2 and shipped-locales to keep track of which locales want to ship what.

Per discussion with beltzner, we're not really taking sign-offs for Beta 2, but instead ship anything that's green and has shipped in Beta 1.

Looking at the diffs, nothing blocking showed up, so we can actually ship the greens.

Locales that are red right and shipped in 3.6b1 are

af
bg
da
et
eu
ja
ja-JP-mac	
ka
kk
ko
mk
nb-NO
nn-NO

Landed the state of the art on 1.9.2 and buildbot-configs, http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/rev/00d8589921d6, http://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/rev/36cae32d3493.

If we're not code-freezing tonight, there probably will be a few more changes, so this isn't FIXED until we built.

But we're not blocked anymore by wrong legacy data in either l10n-changesets_mozilla-1.9.2 nor shipped-locales.
Update:

No Japanese so far.
Sorry Japanese late opt-in.
# I had a trouble with ssh and could not hg push for a while...

I just opted-in with these changesets
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n-mozilla-1.9.2/ja/file/af454feeb8d2
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n-mozilla-1.9.2/ja-JP-mac/file/8dc09c9d088c
and please include ja/ja-JP-mac into the shipped-locales.
http://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/rev/6d3570f94594, http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/rev/081ac0b8126b, add both japanese to both places.
I think we can close this. :)


Update l10n-changesets and shipped-locales for Firefox 3.6 Beta 2
