I frequently lose my history when logging off or exiting Firefox. There is no specific pattern. I have added the backup extension and added the history backup option, but it still lost my history when exiting Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Do you delete some of your history items from the address bar's autocomplete window by using shift-delete??
If so, it's highly likely that this is a duplicate of Bug 242207, looks like it won't be fixed uptil Firefox 2.0


Complete history loss after exiting Firefox, or logging off. Happens frequently, not all the time.
