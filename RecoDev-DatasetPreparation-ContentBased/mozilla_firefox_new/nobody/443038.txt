works for me

Sorry, I just realised that firefox 3 is not opening any pop-ups for me. So this is not limited to firstdirect.com. All pop-ups working fine on firefox2. Problem persists despite changing setting to allow all popups. Also even if you add site name to the whitelist it would still block them.

No message bar is shown saying that popup is blocked.

Maybe this could be clubbed with some other bug. Searched but couldn't find one exactly the same. Also, maybe this bug is fixed in version 3.0.1pre. I have changed any settings since the upgrade of firefox 3beta on my ubuntu desktop to firefox 3. was working fine on firefox 3 beta.

sorry I meant I have NOT changed any settings since upgrade.
SOLVED. The problem was with incompatible either the SEO toolbar or SEOQUAKE plugin or MAPS plugin from firefox 2 that was causing this problem on firefox 3 following the upgrade. The popups started working following uninstalling these.
