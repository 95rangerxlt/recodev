After I installed Firefox beta and Minefield, the feedback tool doesn't work. When I click the "Firefox Made Me Happy Because..." button, it redirects to a page that says I have to install/upgrade the beta, even though I have the latest beta.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox beta
2.Install Minefield
3.Try submitting feedback using Firefox beta
Actual Results:  
Redirect to download beta page

Expected Results:  
Allow to submit feedback
