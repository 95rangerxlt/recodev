When a pdf hasn't loaded, the "Current view" button links to resource://pdf.js/web/#

It becomes more obvious when a document loads slow or not at all. If you want to check it, either click "cancel" for a password protected document, or try this one, which currently doesn't load: http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

The button should probably be disabled when there's no file loaded.
