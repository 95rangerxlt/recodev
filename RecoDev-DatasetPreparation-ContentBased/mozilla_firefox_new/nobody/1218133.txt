User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20151014143721

Steps to reproduce:

Use regular Firefox with Developer Theme Plugin by Firefox


Actual results:

Like a lot of people I think that the Developer Theme is far better than the regular theme because it takes less display space. So after the developers took out the posibility to "turn on" the developer theme in regular Firefox I installed the Developer Edition Theme Plugin as Firefox developers suggested in the forum.
The problem is that the skin looks bad and all "clunky". The borders have strange lines and the "X" buttons on the tabs look bad when the display resolution is 1366x768


Expected results:

Developer Theme look like it used to.

The border was fixed in bug 1163184, which is Firefox 42, which will be released in about a week from now (or you can switch to the beta channel). You didn't attach a screenshot of the close buttons on tabs, so I'm not sure what you mean. Can you be more explicit? It's possible that that, too, is something that was fixed for Firefox developer edition (43) but not for 41 or maybe not even for 42. It's hard to say without seeing what you mean exactly, though. :-)

Wow what a fast answer, with things like these you encourage more people to fill bug reports.
I remind you that I am using the normal edition with the Developer Edition Theme, because it seems that in the bug link you provide they are talking about the developer edition. 

I know I didn't provide a screenshot for the close button bug because in order to reproduce I have to try it in an other display. I think it has something to do with the button not rescaling correctly.

I will wait for the update in the normal edition and if the bugs continue I will report back. 

Thanks.
This bug has been fixed, even the problem with the "X" button on the tabs and low resolution displays.
