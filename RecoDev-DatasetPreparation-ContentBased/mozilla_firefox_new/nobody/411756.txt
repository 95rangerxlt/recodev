contacted jason to try and get status...
I have updated the extension to work with Firefox 3. The new version is available for testing at http://imagezoom.yellowgorilla.net/development/
hi jason, it would be great of you could get the new version updated for review and publishing on addons.m.o   that way beta testers would also get the update when they try out firefox 3.  any thoughts on when you would be able to do that?
changelog of Version 0.3.1 on a.m.o.:
"update to be Firefox 3.0 compatible"

-> FIXED?
updated on amo, fixed. thanks!
