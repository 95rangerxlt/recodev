The Blob constructor should be used instead.
pdf.js is not only specific to Firefox. Until other browsers support the Blob constructor, BlobBuilder will be needed as a fallback.
That will not help much, as the code I mean is "var bb = new MozBlobBuilder();". See MXR.
Looks like pdf.js now uses Blob() when available and falls back to MozBlobBuilder().
