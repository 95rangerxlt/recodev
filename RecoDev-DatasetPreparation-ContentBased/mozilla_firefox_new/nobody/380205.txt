I'm seeing that the _viewer's itemChanged() is not being called in this scenario.
you get the same result (the _viewer's itemChanged() is not being called)
not just when you do the change (title) from Bookmarks Manager.

1. open Firefox.
2. make sure your Bookmarks Toolbar is visible.
3. call Properties for folder or livemark item, in Bookmarks Toolbar folder, from any places view (Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Sidebar, Bookmarks Manager, Bookmarks Menu).
4. change the title...

result:
the item title changed in the Bookmarks Manager but didn't changed in the
Bookmarks Toolbar.
Both cases work fine for me. Perhaps something specific to the bookmarks being used?
interesting, with my fresh build [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a5pre) Gecko/20070510 Minefield/3.0a5pre], both scenarios in comment #0 are now working for me.

I'm now getting the proper call to itemChanged() (which will call itemReplaced()) in toolbar.xml

perhaps asaf's changes for bug #372508 have fixed this?
onemen.one@gmail.com, can you double check in a build after mano's fix?
confirm WFM
Sorry about the change did not recognize the email address.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
