Im providing you the links to examples: http://www.tcpdf.org/examples.php
Created attachment 716499
Example no.1 opened with built-in PDF reader
Created attachment 716500
Example no.1 opened with Adobe Reader
Web console says the font has been rejected by the platform.
Example No. 15 with bookmarks doesn't work with the viewer, also not with google chrome. 
Normally you can set PDF bookmarks using the Bookmark() method and set PDF named destinations using the setDestination() method.
Before Firefox 19 the document was automatically opened with the Foxit-reader. On the left site of the pdf were  bookmarks. In the new Firefox built-in PDF viewer they are not shown.
This issue is also being tracked in the pdf.js issue tracker:
https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2754

It seems to be related to HWA.
The problem goes away if you disable font subsetting in TCPDF.
I disabled font subsetting ($pdf->setFontSubsetting(false);) but this did not fix the bookmark-problem. 
@Christian Schmidt:
Was ($pdf->setFontSubsetting(false);) enough for you to fix the bookmark-problem or did you something else?
My comment about font subsetting only related to the rendering problems as reported by Nino Vranešič.

The bookmark problem sounds like a separate issue, so I recommend that you create a separate bug report for that.


Firefox built-in PDF viewer doesn't support TCPDF
