Important: e10s is disabled.

With e10s enabled it doesn't work either, but that's bug 1126421.
See Bug 1083498,
The Add-on should be revised to conform to the latest specifications.
Thanks (as always) for bisecting this bug, Alice! :)

I sent an email about this bug (and e10s bug 1126421) to ffjon, the developer of this add-on.

It seems with the latest update 2.0.8, rikaichan is working. If someone else can confirm.
Calling this fixed based on comment #4.
