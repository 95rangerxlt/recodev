When you have an App Tab focused (in my case, Google Calendar) and choose "Open All in Tabs" the first bookmark of the folder replaces the current App Tab content instead of opening a new tab like the other bookmarks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder with two bookmarks (ex: https://www.xgold.ca/ and http://www.xsoli.com/)
2. Focus a App Tab (ex: Google Calendar)
3. Click at "Open All in Tabs" of the folder with the two bookmarks.

Actual Results:  
The App Tab get replaced with https://www.xgold.ca.

Expected Results:  
I think the first bookmark should be opened in a new tab, like the others.

Marco, is it a dupe of bug 440093?
This seems to be the same behaviour and cause as  bug 440093, however now we have app tabs the bug's impact is worse. App tabs are meant to be persistent. 

As bug 579872 has been fixed it would seem consistent to prevent this case of a bookmark from overwriting an app tab.

Shouldn't this (or 440093 if this is dupped) really block bug 579874?

> Marco, is it a dupe of bug 440093?

similar but with app-tabs that behavior is really not wanted... I think we should have both bugs open.
*** Bug 647609 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Since bug 440093 landed this is WFM.


"Open All in Tabs" change a currently selected App Tab with the first URL of the folder
