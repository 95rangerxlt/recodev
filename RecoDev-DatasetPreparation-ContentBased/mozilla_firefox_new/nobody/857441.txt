Most likely because there are some very ugly hacks in AP__updateSize. Maybe we can do better.

This seems to do the trick.

There were a few typos in there as well. Most notably:
> this._list.height = this._panel.clientHeight;
It should be _list.clientHeight if we want to preserve the actual height and not incrementally enlarge it with every key press.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for your patch. I can't notice the problem you report on my system (Linux). What I see is a bit of popup flickering every time I type something. That's not fixed with this patch.

Is this change needed? I had toolkit/browser reviewers asking me to change foo.setAttribute("flex", "1") to foo.flex.

I'm unsure about this change, but it works for me (Linux here), and if it works for you as well, then this is fine.

Afaik 5ms was there for a purpose, back when I wrote the code. I tried 0 and it didn't work *back then*. I can't notice any regression now. We leave this 0 now.

That's because we're setting the list width to take scrollbars into account. I can't think of any non-incredibly hacky way of doing this.

Probably not.

It was stupid to begin with.

<rant>
The list is contained in a panel. Therefore the panel height is by definition >= than the list height. In practice, it was a few pixels larger. Therefore, without this change, the panel height was increasing a few pixels in height every time a key was pressed and the timeout hit.

This is not a timeout anymore, it's a thread dispatch.

The 0 there is a constant === Ci.nsIThread.DISPATCH_NORMAL. The other value is Ci.nsIThread.DISPATCH_SYNC which is useless here.
Even I don't see the jumping on Windows. The only flickering that I see for a millisecond is the width being adjusted to remove the scrollbar need. The same thing that Mihai mentioned.
