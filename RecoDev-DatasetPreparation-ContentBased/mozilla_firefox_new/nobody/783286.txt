Was clicking a link on www.amazon.com. Sometimes made it through one click, sometimes crashed on the first click.

I believe this is the same crash: http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-c81c008c-6a9b-400b-ae97-845bd2120816

Stack trace attached.

Your nightly is a known crasher.  There was a re-spin yesterday, and now today's build is out...  update and see if the crash persists.
Yup, all better now. Thanks.
