waiting on a patch from Neil to fix this up. No bug filed on his end yet.
*** Bug 579526 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I hope we can get this fixed in b4. I'm requesting blocking status for this, because the behavior is clearly incorrect (see the screenshot in the description)
this should be fixed now as a result of landing the titlebar patch in bug 574408.

Marking fixed.
