I was using my email just fine, then for no reason I can not open my email provider of comcast.net or comcast.net/a.  I get a error message of;Error. Page cannot be displayed. Please contact service provider for more details.

I can not open any emails, so please don't email me unless you fix this problem.  I went to tools and added this web site to exception lists for pop ups, but it still does not work.

Reproducible: Always

This is not a Mozilla-related issue:

Somebody hacked into the Network Solutions account and email has been a problem since then. They're working on it.


Will not open Comcast.net or Email page
