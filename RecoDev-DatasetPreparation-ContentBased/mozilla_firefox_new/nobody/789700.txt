I tried to contact the FDM people through their contact form.
It's #22 top browser crasher in 15.0.1.

It seems to be fixed in FDM 1.5.7.6:

HI!
FDM extension crashed when a user tried to enter URL of a file (not a web page) into the address bar. 
This bug was fixed.

It seems so according to correlations per extension version in 16.0.2:
  vmsfdmff.dll@0x5728|EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_EXEC (152 crashes)
     99% (151/152) vs.   0% (407/153951) fdm_ffext@freedownloadmanager.org

          0% (0/152) vs.   0% (4/153951) 1.5.7.6
Version 1.5.7.6 is not released: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/free-download-manager-plugin/

It's #3 top browser crasher in 17.0.
Sent an email to alervd asking about the update release timeline.
Since version 1.5.7.6 hasn't been uploaded to AMO yet, we have decided to block version 1.5.7.5.

@Alervd: please submit your update to AMO as soon as possible, so less users run into this block and have problems with it.

This is now blocked: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/blocked/i216
(In reply to Jorge Villalobos [:jorgev] from comment #7)

Confirmed.

I take it this is across versions, so this fixed 17 as well. And I don't see any crashes in this DLL in the top 300 for 17.0.1 now.
HI!
We updated our plugin on Mozilla add-ons store and waiting for the approve. 
(https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/free-download-manager-plugin/)
It's not fixed with the latest version. Thus, it's #79 top browser crasher in 17.0.1, #24 in 18.0b4 and #52 in 19.0a2.
Here are correlations per FDM version in 17.0.1

HI!
Can you send memory dump file to bugs @ freedownloadmanager.org so we could analyze the reason of these crashes?
Alervd: We cannot send the memory dump in an email. You or someone else would have to come in to one of the Mozilla offices in order to be able to see it.

(In reply to Alervd from comment #12)
> HI!

HI!

This stack trace does not look good according to our MAP file:

1 	vmsfdmff.dll 	vmsfdmff.dll@0x5728 	
2 	vmsfdmff.dll 	vmsfdmff.dll@0x38f6 	
3 	vmsfdmff.dll 	vmsfdmff.dll@0x3f69 

2nd and 3d - are OK, but the 1st one - something strange...

But we analyzed code related to (3) and (2) and fixed some potential crash bugs.
We plan to release the new version today or in a few days.
Yes, this bug must be fixed now.
Are you going to submit the new version to addons.mozilla.org?
HI!
We've just updated it. Most of our users will update in 3-5 days approximately.
New version is 1.5.7.9.
This crash showed up on the explosive report today, so I guess users have not updated to the new version yet since the crashes are happening with 1.5.7.6.
The latest version available on AMO is 1.5.7.6: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/free-download-manager-plugin/

It's still correlated to the this version:

New version of our extension was not accepted due to binary components (which exists in the old one too).
New build number of vmsfdmff.dll is 1262 (so its version is 1262.0.0.0).
I can't find reports with this version of the module so I believe the bug was fixed.
