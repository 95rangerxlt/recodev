On dark backgrounds, I see the following issues with the new icons:

- Dropmarker on the keyhole is not visible
- Stop and Reload buttons have rough edges (or rather seem to have rough edges)

Please see the screenshot for more details.

Other icons seem fine.

new aero icons on dark background

Screenshot.
Changing Bug description to note that this is just a problem with Aero Stop/Reload buttons; the XP versions are fine.

In the XP version, there is a problem with the Keyhole, where its borders on a dark background are not sharp.
The glow that you are noting on stop and reload is standard for glyph icons on Vista.  We wanted to have it in place for when we get Aero glass support after Firefox 3.  If you are planning on placing the icons on a black glass toolbar, you will probably want to modify the Vista glyphs to remove the glow (you also might want the icons to be a brighter color).  I'll see if I can get the source files posted.

We need to fix the drop marker (on both Vista and XP).

XP Icons on dark background

Actually I did notice that on a few Vista apps (Windows Live Photo Gallery for example). But, for now, while we don't have Aero Glass support, can't we not have the glow. Maybe we can check-in these icons (with the glow) as and when we introduce the Aero Glass support.

From the screenshot:

The stop/reload for XP look really nice on dark as well as light backgrounds - maybe we could use something similar for Vista theme.

Note: the rough edges of XP Keyhole on dark backgrounds.

yeah that is certainly an option, I need to check what these look like using the classic OS theme as well to see if the glow is causing problems there as well.

>Note: the rough edges of XP Keyhole on dark backgrounds.

Yep, thanks for pointing that out.
Even with Glass turned on, the window frame will turn dark when the window is maximized and the glow is visible. I don't know if that's intended behavior or not.

good point

The same happens in other apps in Vista, so it is consistent behavior.  For a good example, open Windows Media Player and maximize it.
Removing blocking 405605 since we are going to use that bug to track css changes.
should be fixed by bug 546098
