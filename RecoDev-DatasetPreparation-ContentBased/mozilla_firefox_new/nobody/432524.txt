Add-on icons in the Navigation Toolbar look ugly in the new Mac theme (Firelight/Proto) for Minefield/FF 3.0 because they don't get their own buttons and hang around like alien objects. The GrApple theme (www.takebacktheweb.org) does it correctly.

Reproducible: Always

This exact request was implemented in the new theme for FF4.
I suggest closing this bug as resolved:fixed.
