Bug 697319 landing broke several extensions. Confirmed are MEGA EXTENSION [1], GMail Manager [2] and Browser Backgrounds [3]. When these extensions are enabled, it becomes impossible to open or close new tabs (and the error console), making the browser essentially unusable. I'm told that this is the result of bad programming in the extensions and that they could be easily fixed [4], though.

STR:
1) From a fresh profile, install any of the listed extensions.
2) Restart the browser, and notice that only a single tab is opened. Pressing the new tab button doesn't visibly do anything.
3) Try to close the browser - it will warn about closing multiple tabs.

Confirmed here, disabling the Mega extension fixed it.
