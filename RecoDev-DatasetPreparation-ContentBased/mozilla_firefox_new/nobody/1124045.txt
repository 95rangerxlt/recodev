Build ID: 20150116085230

Steps to reproduce:

- Viewed the new-tab page (enhanced mode)
- Sponsored tile showing Firefox for Android is shown
- Clicked the tile


Actual results:

- Was taken to play.google.com/listen (one of my frequently visited sites)


Expected results:

- The tile should not be showing as the sponsored tile for my frequent site, it should show the thumbnail.

The site address is listed below the tile correctly in classic new tab page mode, but the thumbnail is blank. It appears that the enhanced new tab page is mistaking the play.google.com domain site for the Get Firefox For Android sponsored tile.

On a clean profile, going to play.google.com reproduces this - it shifts the firefox for android tile. If you then switch to classic mode, the thumbnail works; I guess that might just be it getting evicted or something? Not sure.

Either way, this doesn't sound like fun.
I tested this a bit more to find out if it was happening with other tiles as well. It appears to happen for some, but not all. Using a new profile, I opened each of the tiles and then went to a related site with the same domain name, and the visited each of them several times (between 4 and 5 visits each so that they would become frequently visited sites). 

For the three Mozilla tiles that it happened with, a new Sponsored box appears underneath the tile in enhanced view even though they do not normally appear as Sponsored.

For the Booking.com tile that it happens with, the Sponsored box remains after the tile directs to a frequently visited site. 

As before, the tiles are correctly listed in classic new tab page mode, however unlike the instance above with play.google.com, the thumbnails do not remain blank in classic view. Again, it appears that the enhanced new tab page is mistaking the frequently visited domains for the sponsored tiles.

This should be fixed with bug 1105360, so the directory link for manifesto and firefox for android don't enhance history tiles.
