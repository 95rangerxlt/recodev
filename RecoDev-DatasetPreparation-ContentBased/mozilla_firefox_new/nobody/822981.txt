could be an issue in the snippet...

> could be an issue in the snippet...

Correct! This has been corrected in the offending snippet and I can no longer reproduce. It will take up to 24 hours for the snippet to be redistributed, but you can force a refresh of your snippets by entering `localStorage['snippets-last-update'] = 0` in the JS console on about:home and then refreshing.

Long term this bug will be covered by some in-progress work on a new snippet service.

Winston: The cause of this issue was the Social API icon (shown above) URL: it had `--` in it, which (unfortunately) breaks the validity of the snippet. If you use the icon again, can you reupload it to wherever you upload the icons and check to see there's no `--` in the URL?
