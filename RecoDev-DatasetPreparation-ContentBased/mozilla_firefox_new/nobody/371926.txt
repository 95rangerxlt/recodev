We should do a review of the l10n impact of the places bookmarks part.

At least the current default_places.html file should be sanitized and split into parts that should be localized and others.
We should specify how we want to handle changes to default places in upcoming version with profile migration, and how to bootstrap the profile, in particular, do we want to keep the split between default bookmarks.html in the profile and default_places.html in chrome.

Are there any changes to how we're doing feeds in places? Load impact, UI, etc, that we need to announce to our feed partners?

A conference call can't hurt, as well as some pointers to current design and planning docs. I found http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places:Bookmarks:Rethinking, but that had its last edit in May 06, by brettw.

meeting notes:

http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places:L10n_impact_meeting/2007-03-19
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
