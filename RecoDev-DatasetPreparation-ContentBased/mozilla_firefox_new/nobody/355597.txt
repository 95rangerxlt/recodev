I used the windowsupdate.com site to install a number of non-critical updates
(most of them for hardware such as WLAN card, modem, mouse, touchpad, etc.),
and I was prompted to restart the computer.  After the restart, Firefox wouldn't start.  Each attempt at starting Firefox would lead the firefox.exe process to terminate almost immediately, *without* causing a crash.  So, unfortunately, there are no talkback IDs to report.  Check out bug #355594 which is a similar problem on the same machine and at the same time happening with Thunderbird as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to start Firefox.
2. Watch nothing happening (because the process is silently terminating.)
3. Start Firefox in Safe Mode.
4. Disable the Talkback extension.
5. Close Firefox.
6. Start Firefox in normal mode.
7. Watch the browser open fine.
8. Enable the Talkback extension.
9. Restart Firefox.
10. Watch nothing happening (like before.)

I could go on and on with the same procedure.

If it matters, I have SeaMonkey "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060729 SeaMonkey/1.0.4" installed, and this problem doesn't seem to affect it.
What is happening if you disable your other extensions, but let Talkback be enabled?

As long as Talkback is enabled, the problem shows again (I've tried it with no other extensions enabled, as well as with individual extensions enabled.)


I have observed the same problem in Firefox 3 alpha 1, and the trunk's nightly build.  Disabling the Talkback extension did solve the startup issue in these cases as well.

FWIW, there's a forum discussion <http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2649628>.
Ehsan, Does this also fail for you with current trunk?  (which uses breakpad instead of talkback)

Nope.  I used to observe this problem on trunk when it used Talkback.  (I used to do my development on trunk with the Talkback extension disabled).  As soon as Breakpad was activated on the trunk, this problem no longer happens on trunk.  Updating the product version number of this bug.

FWIW, and just to reiterate: I observed this on a normal 32-bit XP Home installation (not x64).  And of course, since Talkback seemed to be the crasher itself, I could never get a Talkback ID for the crash!  :-)
Fixed by the removal of Talkback.


Firefox not starting with the Talkback extension enabled
