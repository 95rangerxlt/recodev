Confirmed - using today's nightly build using cset:

I have tested builds back to first part of July and still not found where this went broke.  

Has it ever worked I wonder ?

If you Select a Group of cookies (ex: click on the '2o7.net' cookies folder) the 'Remove all cookies' button will light up (tested with Firefox 4.0 beta 6 & Firefox 3.6.12), but if you make the mistake thinking it will delete the selected cookies, and press the button it will remove ALL your cookies not just the selected cookies.

If you select multiple cookies (not just search for them) then press the 'Delete' key on your keyboard, you will only delete what was selected.
Is this behaviour different in ff 3.6.x?

Not working with above build also.
I'm not surprised that to me is the expectation.  Having Remove All cookies is disabled after filtering a search makes sense, because remove all cookies actually removes all cookies, not just 1 cookie domain folder found in a search.  How about using remove cookies.. does that work like the delete key?  I just wiped out all mine. doh
This is not a regression.  3.5 branch works the same way, this is a enhancement request.  

I wouldn't expect 'Remove all cookies' to be enabled with filtering search results, as 'remove cookies' works like its suppose to with filtered search results.  

I would this should be wontfix.

If remove all cookies wipes everything out (like happened to you in Comment #6) shouldn't selecting cookies (clicking on them), also turn off the 'Remove all cookies' button, just like after doing a search for them does?

And/or, since the link Tile (comment #0) is "remove individual cookies" could there be a warning asking something like 'Do you want to remove Every cookie? Doing this will...', or Hover over text for the Button saying something similar?
If you want to delete all filtered cookies you can select one and just press and hold delete key until the list is cleared...
Ops sorry didnt mean to remove anything....
Comment #7 is correct, this is expected behavior, so that you don't delete all your cookies while viewing a subset of them. Blocking-.

Not closing this bug though - I recommend you repurpose it to clarify the interaction (or at least the string).
I think if "select all" Ctrl+A (Cmd+A) worked, this would be much less of an issue. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything when in search results.
This bug was fixed by bug 705422.
