The bug is i think a design deficiency.
When closing Firefox, it just checks whether firefox binary is still running or not.

If you opened "View Source" window then when you close a multiple tabs hosting window it closes normally without showing "Quit Firefox" dialog as firefox is still running (from the "View Source" window) 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox normally.
2. open multiple tabs and in each tab browse to a site.
3. now open Download Manager. (You can open any new firefox based window,)
4. close the Window that holds multiple tabs. 
Actual Results:  
Firefox would close without showing "Quit Firefox" dialog.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should show "Quit Firefox" dialog even if any other window of Firefox was running at that time.

Just saw the user agent attached to this bug report.
Ignore the user agent attached in the bug report.
As i was using a hack to bypass megaupload limitation.
I am running Firefox 3 Beta3 .

I see the Confirm Close dialog, but not the Quit Minefield dialog. And this is caused by bug 354894.

Hi Klaassen 

I am running Firefox 3 beta3 and configured to open blank tab upon startup.

When i kept open the download window and close the Main browser window that hosts multiple tabs i am not getting confirm close dialog. i am very sure.
Can't find the original bug, so confirming for now.

It isn't. Session Restore doesn't display any Close/Quit prompts.
*** Bug 426910 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

Session restore DOES by default show a dialog asking to save and quit, quit, or cancel. you can choose to not have that dialog come up at all. If you then close Firefox, the expected behavior happens, UNLESS there is a dialog of some sort open, or the downloads window. Even a pop up window will destroy the session. I believe this could be fixed, as well as having functionality added by designating one window as the "main" window for purposes of session data. This would require a substantial rewrite, but I really think something needs to be done about it before gold.

Actually, that's browser glue doing that (different code path). This can't be fixed correctly without both code paths being kept synchronized, though.

> I really think something needs to be done about it before gold.

The same issue has existed in Firefox 2 (just slightly less visibly), so at this stage in the game, you'll just have to live with it for another major release.

To ease your pain until Firefox.next, try the Session Manager extension <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2324> which allows to reopen accidentally closed windows and makes backups of your sessions.
It is really disappointing to hear that even in Firefox 3 final this bug won't be resolved :(

As you told this bug is present in firefox since session manager got integrated to the core .

I should have open this bug report in Alpha days.
But this bug is really a ugly one, as you told even a simple pop up window can render a 10 tabs useless. 

Also you can't expect people always to be in alert to not close the current window.
This is a bug. This is not a bug that the end-user would report, this is a bug that designers and developers notice. This does not make the bug less serious, or less important to fix before a release, as it does impact usability. This needs to be fixed, and the fact that an extension that fixes the problem was released during the beta 1 stages shows that this should have been taken care of. 

Oh well. I guess FF3.5 is going to be needed.
Not a regression from Firefox 2, not going to block final.  This does indeed suck in this case, but now that a single pref controls the warning, you'll at least get a warning on close if you want that behaviour.  Not reading dialogs isn't something we can really do much about, if you're just hitting OK when getting prompted like this...
It isn't really a matter of not reading the dialogue, it's that the dialog isn't consistant. I realize and understand the behavior, but the average user will not attribute having the download box open, or even a pop up for that matter as being part of their "browsing session", and therefore the "save tabs and quit" feature becomes something that will seemingly only work sporadically.
I have to say this took me a bit to work out why sometimes it would offer to save tabs and why at other times it wouldn't. Apps like ChatZilla and download manager I used to keep open continuously, so didn't think about them being part of the Firefox main program.

I really would expect to be able to save tabs upon closing Firefox with only ChatZilla open (or be warned of losing things at least). But hey, I know this sort of thing takes quite a bit of development and hope it gets sorted out for 3.next.

I don't understand why this can't be fixed. File>Exit generates the right behavior, but the close button does not. Why can't the two be synchronized?

Exit closes all of Firefox; close just closes that window, and not any others that may be open.  The prompt is set to come up on exiting Firefox, and won't come up until all of Firefox (all windows) is closed.

The problem is that other windows are allowed to persist past the browser(s) being closed, and they could be brought back at that point too.  Prompting on last browser close would be saving the session when Firefox hasn't exited yet.  This would probably be best, but then it'd have to be ready to bring the session back without reloading, and there'd probably be a few other issues along the way.  Hopefully this can be fixed at some point, but it's not top priority as it doesn't cause that much trouble for many.
This bug has been duped at least 8 times and the product isn't even final yet, which makes me wonder what exactly qualifies as "much trouble for many"?
Crashes and outright broken things.  Yes, it needs to be fixed.  I'm just quoting previous comments noting that this is non-blocking.  Please don't debate over fixing bugs unless you plan to fix them yourself.  ;)
In Firefox 3.0 RC1, the severity of the bug has been considerably decreased.
Now even when i close the browser window with many tabs and when some other Window of Firefox kept open, i am receiving a warning.

So, i am removing the blocker and going to decrease the severity .

You've removed the flag saying it wasn't blocking, that's what the "-" is for.

And I've always received that warning, I still think it's a pretty serious bug, because I know Firefox quite well and got confused as to why the "Save Session" dialogue wasn't coming up, most users will never figure out why and think it's just random behavior.
Yes, removing the rejected block flag wasn't quite right.  Not the biggest of deals, though.

1) In alphas you can land major patches; in betas less-so; in release candidates you only make minor _very_ necessary changes. It'll probably be on the table for 3.1 or something.

2) Please stop the bugspam.

Got this bug when I had 2 tabs opened, one of them has the BBC Radio Homepage, and a web radio player (BBC´s one) opened as new window. When I chose to close Firefox, before closing the web radio player, no dialog appears asking me to save the tabs. When I open again the Firefox, all the tabs are gone. If I close the player before closing Firefox, It will ask me normally to save the tabs.

I´m using Firefox Version 3.

It works for me on trunk. People who experienced this bug can test it on trunk ( http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/ ) in safe mode or with a blank profile, in this way:

1. open Firefox
2. open another tab (it could be also blank)
3. open download manager
4. try to close the window with [X], or File-> Close _window_, or CTRL+SHIFT+W (or equivalent)

This bug is still live in 3.1b. I switched back to 3.0.1 to get around the terrible slow down i was experiencing with transparent rendering. I might need to go back to 3.0 to get it to go away entirely. Web pages with transparent images (or flash) bring the browser to a halt. But that is unrelated to this.  Anyway, if the downloads window is open the "save and quit" dialog is not show, only the "you are closing multiple tabs" warning.

A suggestion would be to have the close button do a check to see if it is the only browser window open (as in not the bookmarks or download window or whatever) and if so then prompt for a session save and have it save just the tab info. It seems like it would be pretty easy to make some "if then" lines that would handle it correctly.
Bump. Restarted Firefox when it was acting up and lost all my tabs, due to having the Download window up. This wouldn't be a problem if the browsing history remembered closing time, or if they were still in "recently closed tabs". No go. Very annoying :(

Fixed by bug 354894.


Not showing "Quit Firefox" dialog when some other non-browser Firefox window is still open (downloads, view source, error console, extension, etc.)
