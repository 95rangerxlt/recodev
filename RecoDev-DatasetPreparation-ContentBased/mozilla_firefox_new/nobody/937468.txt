Basically, they should avoid the situations bug 937465 will warn about.

Grepping addons for "clonenode()" with no args is easy even using the addons mxr; we seem to have several dozen addons doing this.

Grepping for importNode with only one arg is harder; Jorge, do you have a sane way to do that?

No, the regular expression search on MXR is tragic. However, importNode doesn't yield that many results and they all fit on a page. I didn't see any instances of it being called with only one argument.
OK, so I've gone through all the addons mxr showed me.  The following either definitely or probably have issues:

/5811/chrome/content/settings.js -- unclear
/7748/content/mybookmarks.js -- cloning a body; wants the kids
/8206/content/tinymce/plugins/safari/editor_plugin.js -- unclear
/8206/content/tinymce/plugins/safari/editor_plugin_src.js -- unclear
/8880/chrome/semantic-turkey/content/scripts/options2.js -- probably wants kids
/13749/chrome/content/pflib.js -- definitely wants kids
/289670/chrome/content/rangy-core.js -- unclear
/295345/resources/github-and-bugzilla/data/tweaks.js -- definitely wants kids
/337172/chrome/content/wa.js -- cloning documents; definitely wants kids
/358679/colortransform.js -- unclear
/411408/content/finder.js -- definitely wants kids for one of the calls

the rest are fine: cloning just-created empty elements or have that string in comments or whatnot.

Jorge, would it be possible to get in touch with those add-on developers?
Yes, we can contact them about it. What should the message be? Specifically, what should they use instead?
Oh, sorry.  Instead of "cloneNode()" they should use "cloneNode(true)".
Jorge, can I go ahead and make the behavior change here in 29?  The warning for this is shipping in 28, and addons have a while to update until 29...
Yes, go ahead with the change. I haven't had a chance to contact the developers, but will do so either this week or next week.
All developers have been informed about the upcoming change. Is there anything else needed for this bug?
No, I don't think so.  Thank you, Jorge!


In preparation for bug 937461, get addons to audit their uses of cloneNode()/importNode() with no boolean arg
