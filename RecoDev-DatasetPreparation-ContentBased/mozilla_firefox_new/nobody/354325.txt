The new theme on the trunk has the reload icon clipped while in small icons with or without text. More noticeable without text. See attached screenshot.

Hmm actually it appears clipped in all mode be in Large/Small icons w/wo text.
I'm assuming this is by design and not actually clipped now. If it is by design, when you hover over the reload icon in large icon mode...on the left side looks jagged.

This looks perfectly normal and not clipped to me...?
I guess this should block bug 347454, not bug 353673.

"clipped" as in not a gradual rounding on the left side...its a sudden straight up edge on the left side and not rounded.
Resolving this INVALID since this is not an issue with the icon in the new theme.


Reload icon appears clipped in all modes
