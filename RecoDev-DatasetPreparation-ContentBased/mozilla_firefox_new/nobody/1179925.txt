It would be great to inform a user that Firefox will look and work great in Windows 10.

Initial talks have been sending this message via /whatsnew. But considering that users may take a day, or a week, or months to update (thus missing the /whatsnew), it may not hit the user at the most crucial time.

Is it possible to detect that this is the first time a user is viewing Firefox in Windows 10, and redirect them to a specific URL?

/whatsnew is going to be able to achieve the time-sensitivity that is actually desired here.

The relevancy of showing a "Firefox works on Windows 10!" page will depreciate over time. Certainly a year down the road it will be irrelevant, and somewhere in between now and a year it will still be somewhat relevant.

With that being said, Firefox on Windows 10 in my eyes doesn't provide enough "different" interactions from Windows 8.1, 8, or 7 to need to give a tutorial/tour months after the release.

Therefore, I don't think this bug is something that we should pursue. /whatsnew could be used for two releases in a row if deemed necessary.
To answer your question directly: The update server only knows the current OS of the user - it has no way of knowing if it's their first time running that version, or their 100th.

We've done whatsnew pages like this before, where we only want to show them once per user, but they require extra client code. bug 950405 has an example of this. We could do something similar here if someone can deal with the client bits.

However, please keep in mind that we can only have a single what's new page. If we show a Windows 10 one for Firefox 41 or 42, we can't show those users another one for other features. I suspect this will be problematic for Firefox 42 (our next big feature release IIRC). So, perhaps we should just do this for 40 & 41?

An alternative way of going about this could be a client side only implementation that happens independently of the what's new mechanism. It could hardcode a www.mozilla.org URL to show and make sure a user only sees it once. That could live for a much longer period of time, and wouldn't prevent us from using what's new pages for normal feature launches. The other upside here is that it could happen as soon a user starts running Windows 10 instead of waiting for them to update Firefox.

Thanks for this Ben. A couple of questions:

1. How soon can something like this be put into place?
2. When you say, "and make sure a user only sees it once." this is something that you the product would handle?
3. Assuming this is something that has to ship with a browser update. Or can we affect <Fx40 users?

Thanks!

This alternative idea would be 100% client implemented (with the exception of hosting the content on the server), so I can't really speak to it.

It might be able to ship as a hotfix, someone else would have to confirm that though...

Rereading this and thinking about the timeline, I'm not even sure it's worthwhile pursuing the idea - we're only 5 weeks out from shipping 40.0 which is precious little time to implement a brand new notification mechanism.
In bug 1181182, we are creating a /whatsnew URL just for Windows 10 users.

The rollout for Windows 10 may be slow.

Thinking ahead to Fx41 - can we put any mechanisms in place to determine if a user has seen the Windows 10 /whatsnew version? Note: I am just vetting options/possibilities here.

Some use cases of using the same /whatsnew message for Fx 41.

Use Case A:

- User upgrades to Fx40 on Windows 8 (doesn't see message). 
- That user upgrades to Windows 10 at some later point in time.
- User upgrades to Fx41 on Windows 10 (sees our message).

Use Case B:

- User upgrades to Windows 10.
- User upgrades to Fx40 on Windows 10 (sees message). 
- User upgrades to Fx41 on Windows 10 (doesn't see our message).

Would something like this be possible? And could we have this tagging in place for 40?
What about new users who are installing Firefox on Windows 10 for the first time (not an upgrade from an earlier version of Windows). Do you need to tell those users apart?

The update server cannot help at all with this scenario, it does not have any way to track a user across multiple requests. This would need support code in the client, like we had for Australis. I talked about this a bit more in comment #2. You'd need to talk to someone who knows the client side code for feasability and ETA...we're getting pretty late into the 40.0 cycle at this point though.

This would work fine with a plain old server-side whatsnew page. AFAIK we're already doing it in bug 1181182.

That is /firstrun and outside of this discussion.

Yeah, my request was to satisfy both use cases at once.
Bug 1185012 has been opened for implementation. Resolving.
