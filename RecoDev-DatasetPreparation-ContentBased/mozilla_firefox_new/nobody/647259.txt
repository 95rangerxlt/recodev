http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2011-04-01-03-mozilla-central-l10n/?C=S;O=D shows many Installers that are very large. Upon further inspection, I noticed that there were many extra packages embedded in these installers:
Extracting  core/crashreporter.exe
Extracting  firefox-4.2a1pre.bg.win32.exe
Extracting  firefox-4.2a1pre.ja.win32.exe
Extracting  firefox-4.2a1pre.ml.win32.exe

Based on recent landings, I suspect this is either bug 525438's fault, or bug 313956's. However, the latter was backed out before the latest nightlies, so the former seems most likely.

The unpack patch was in the nightly builds on http://l10n.mozilla.org/~axel/nightlies/?date=2011-03-31, but broke all of them. Don't know what exact state those are in.

There's a host of broken ones today for apparently failed mozilla-central clones, we should kick off a clobber for all of them.

The l10n-merge pack should just change the quotes around commands, not which commands actually get executed, so I'd be surprised to see that as the culprit.
I requested an overall clobber on mozilla-central win32 l10n nightly, let's see what that does for us.
This got fixed...but I don't know if it was the clobber, or backout of bug 313956 that did it.


many windows repacks not cleaning up after themselves properly
