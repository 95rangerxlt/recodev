When I press the large thumb button on Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 (Intellipoint v6.2.1), instead of going back to the previous web page, it shifts from Space 1 to Space 4. The Forward button (small thumb button)works correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox in Space 1.
2. Go to a different web page.
3. Press large thumb button on IntelliMouse to browse back to previous web page.
Actual Results:  
Mac shifts from Space 1, where Firefox is running, to Space 4, instead of returning to previously viewed web page.

Expected Results:  
It should have returned to the previously viewed web page, not change to a new Space.

I did update to Version 6.2.1 (v.194) of the IntelliPoint driver. I did note that the Microsoft web site indicated this driver is suitable up to OS X 10.4, but it does not mention 10.5 (Leopard).

I now note that the forward button also cause a switch to a new Space. (From 1 to 2). And I should have noted that this behavior is not present in Safari.
Does this occur outside of Firefox or Safari?  Do the MS drivers emulate a specific keypress that would activate spaces, such as ^-left/right?
This does not occur with Safari. Only with Firefox. Not sure how to answer the question about the mouse drivers, but that seems unlikely to me to be the issue, since Safari doesn't have the same confusion.

Spaces do not switch with these buttons when Firefox isn't the active application.
This may be a Microsoft-Apple driver conflict. I just discovered that the back and forward buttons create the same problem with Spaces when the active application is Apple's Mail application. Firefox may not have much to do with this at all. If not, my apologies.
And I just discovered that Microsoft has posted a new mouse driver, version 6.22. This behavior no longer occurs with that driver. So the fix it to update to the latest Microsoft Intellipoint driver.
I marked this bug as fixed, although I am not sure I am supposed to be the one to do this.
Richard: Since you are the reporter, that is fine, you can either use fixed or works for me. Glad this has been resolved.

[10.5] When Leopard Spaces is active, the Back button on IntelliMouse switches to a different Space instead of to the previous web page.
