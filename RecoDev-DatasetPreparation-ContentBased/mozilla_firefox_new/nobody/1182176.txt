[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

This bug was filed from the Socorro interface and is 
report bp-c3c80472-5043-48b5-888a-a49042150709.
=============================================================

Those crashes started yesterday (2015-07-08) and are now almost 3% of Firefox 40.0b2 data, I guess the 3rd-party software was shipped to people that day. Including today's data, this affects 40.b1, 41.0a2, 42.0a1 in addition - only Win64 builds of course (see filename), and we didn't ship Win64 builds for anything older.

This is the module entry in question:
idmcchandler3_64.dll 	6.23.14.1 	4AB1C734629F418DA346288E21C47F6C1 	idmcchandler64.pdb

A Google search says this is Internet Download Manager.

Lawrence could you reach out to Internet Download Manager? As this is a very recent regression, we might have a good chance of getting a fix (or maybe even a confirmation that a fix already is on the way).
I submitted the following support request to IDM today (automated response said they should get back to me within 2 days):

Hello,

I work at Mozilla as a Firefox Release Manager. Since July 8, 2015, 3% of the crashes reported on Firefox 40.0 Beta look to linked to IDM. Did IDM push an update on this day? Can you please review what has changed recently in IDM to help identify the cause of these crashes. You can see the information that we have and interact with our engineers directly in bug 1182176 in our open Bugzilla system.

Thanks.
Hello Lawrence 

Thank you for the problem report

We have released a new version of extension 3 days ago (6.23.15) where this problem has been already fixed

We had a problem with "6.23.14" IDM version and it was available for downloading for just 2 days. Also the crash happened quite rarely. We estimate it as approximately for 1 user from 1000 users

We could not repeat the crash in our lab. But according to user comments when they select a text with a mouse, our dll run the code with the following lines

PRUnichar* szText = NULL;
rv = idmHelper5->SelToString(selection, &szText);
if (NS_SUCCEEDED(rv) && szText)
{
                  ....
                  NS_Free(szText);
}

where idmHelper5 is XPCOM component and SelToString is a function in js file:

SelToString: function(pSel)
 {
   return pSel.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsISelection).toString();
 }

the crash happened when we called NS_Free(szText);

Although this IDM version was available for downloading for just 2 days, it might be millions of downloads and some users may not ever update IDM. So if you could fix anything on your side in release version of Firefox 40, it would be great. 

Thanks
Charles, thanks for the update. I'm trying to confirm the fix with our crash-stats but I have a few questions.

Was the NS_Free issue limited to 64-bit builds? That's what we're seeing on this crash. Maybe we're talking about two different crashes?

I'm seeing some crash reports like bp-2100ddc7-ad6e-4643-80ba-1737d2150711 that have IDM addon version 6.23.15, but the idmcchandler3_64.dll is still version 6.23.14 (and notably, the machine still hits this crash). Is it normal to have such mixed-version installations?

The above crash report has these stack frames but without a .PDB file we don't know what they are. If you have the PDB for version 6.23.14.1, could you try looking up these offsets to see whether it confirms the NS_Free theory or points to something else?

David,

We managed to repeat this crash in our lab (with old version of dll).

Yes, indeed, the crash happened when calling NS_Free and it affects 64-bit builds only. We had different project options for 32 and 64 bit versions of dll in regard to "C++ Exceptions handling".

We had an exception in NS_Free in 32-bit version in the same place, but it was caught by "try{ } catch(...) {}" block. It was not properly handled in 64-bit version and caused this crash.

Also we can confirm that the new version of dll does not have this problem.

It's possible for users to have a new add-on but old dll if IDM was updating itself when Firefox was opened and dll file was locked. In such cases IDM shows a message that it's required to reboot to replace all files installed during update. But if users ignored this message, after restarting Firefox, they would have new "6.23.15" add-on and old "6.23.14" DLL. Note that after rebooting, DLL will be replaced, but many users don't like to reboot computers, some just close laptops and they go to a sleep mode. Because of a large number of our users, the crashes may continue to happen in this situation.

Note that we did not have such crashes for older versions of Firefox, and you could postpone changes made in memory handling (NS_Free) for this case until Firefox 41. We will rename this DLL in next IDM release (new add-on release) to ensure that a new DLL will load with new versions of Firefox, and, as the result, Firefox 41 should not have such crashes.
Charles, thank you for the detailed information, that's very useful. I'm going to look into the source history of NS_Free and its callees to see if any recent changes stand out.

Does the DLL update require a full reboot of the computer, or just a re-launch of Firefox? If the latter then maybe this problem is self-correcting, since the crash would cause a re-launch.
NS_Free used to be a function in xpcom.dll. It is now an alias of free(). I believe that the problem here is of mismatched allocators. We expect that everyone using binary XPCOM is linking against mozalloc and therefore using the common allocator, but it's possible/likely that IDM is not doing this.

But since binary XPCOM is going away in 41, this probably isn't an issue that will last a long time.
Top-crash tracking
If this were an allocator mismatch, I'd expect a bad read, but we're crashing trying to execute address 0. It's as if we jumped through a busted vtable or bad function pointer.

The only major change to the allocators in version 40 that I can think of is bug 868814, which got rid of mozalloc.dll. But if IDM were depending on that, I'd expect much more widespread problems. Hmm.
We have released a new version of IDM with a new version of extension which is 6.23.16.

We have renamed DLL file, and from this moment new extensions will load only new and fixed dll file.
We're still seeing quite a few crashes with the old DLL. Do we have a way to suggest via the blocklist that users should go get an updated version of the addon?
Flagging for comment 11
If we were to block the add-on, the blocklist page can say and link to whatever we want. Only a fraction of users will click on the link and visit that page, however.

Is IDM CC being updated automatically (updateURL), or are updates pushed in a different way?
Too late for 40.
It is getting too late to fix this in FF41 given that we don't have a patch ready. Let's try to get this fixed in 42.
As a matter of fact we had 40.* in the maximum Firefox version number in install.rdf of that old (buggy) extension. Thus, crashes in Firefox 41 can happen only when extensions compatibility checking is turned off in Firefox settings. This DLL cannot be loaded for ordinary users. I suppose that you should not fix anything in 41, or especially in 42.
Confirmed by crash-stats; this is not happening in any significant volume on versions after 40.
