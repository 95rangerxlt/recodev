I only see this when those buttons are housed on the navigation toolbar. On the tab toolbar, they all stay the same color.
This is normal behavior per Bug 671553
However, I should add that this is not ideal and looks goofy. I did create a stylish script [http://userstyles.org/styles/56094/firefox-8-un-white-toolbar-buttons?r=1320900717] to 'fix' this. However, it does not restore the actual button or glow effect though

All the icons not living in a button should either be normal or inverted depending on if the persona is light or dark. So having two icons randomly inverted is not intended.
Using a build with Bug 735691 fixed, on the default theme with tabs on bottom the panorama button in the nav-bar stays dark instead of being inverted. This needs to be fixed.
