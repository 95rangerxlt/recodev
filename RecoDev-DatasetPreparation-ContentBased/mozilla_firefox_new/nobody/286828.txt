In the page at http://www.student.yorku.ca/~peak/scroll.html, the scroll bar
should work. I also noticed that the text blinker appears in the middle of the
page. The arrow keys still work but the mouse does not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the page
2.Try to scroll
3.

Actual Results:  
It will not scroll. It acts as if the scrollbar is not there.

Expected Results:  
Scrolled

A page that should scroll.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050318
Firefox/1.0+

WFM, so this doesn't appear to affect Windows.
Also, you said this is a Firefox bug but your user agent string is Camino? Which
one are you using?
The wheel scroll works. 
However, it doesn't scroll in the slide of the scroll bar. 

Camino 2005040800 (v0.8+)
Confirmed on DeerPark 20050802.

testcase

added testcase (test.html) that demonstrates better what's going on:
the sidebar "bleeds" into the scrollbar area, obfuscating that area of the
scrollbar, so only the upperpart of the scrollbar is usable/draggable.
This is visible (sometimes) when resizing the window: the scrollbar area gets a
darkgrey color (see screenshot).
Visible in Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;
rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+) and Camino 09a2 (Version 2005080708
(0.9a2+))

screenshot with obfuscated scrollbar
In Firefox 2.0 this still fails.

Minefield (Mac, 20061017), Camino trunk (20061028, v1.2) both work correctly on all testcases here.

There is a similar bug where a fixed positioned div inside a table-cell still causes problems on Mac trunk builds: bug 343830.

Position:fixed causes a vertical scrollbar freeze.  When I load this site, I am unable to use the vertical scrollbar although it looks like it is OK.  This site works fine with Safari (2.0.4 (419.3) and Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/1.5.0.8)

(Tested by saving html and css source locally, modify all urls (except css) to point to midnightbeep.com.  Open html file with only url changes - problem exhibited.  Modify css file to remove all "position:fixed" lines, problem no longer exists.)
Oop - should have said the midnightbeep.com bug shows up on Camino Version 2006091101 (1.0.3) but not on Firefox or Safari
The testcase is still not working in Camino (2007022310 (1.1b)) nor Firefox 2.0.0.3
It works in Safari 2.0.4 (419.3)
This is still a problem with Firefox 2.0.0.4.  Is there any plan to fix this since it has been a problem for well over two years now?

Is this really 2 bugs?

Just rechecked http:www.midnightbeep.com

Camino vertical scroll still not working, background graphics don't load

Firefox vertical scroll works, background graphics don't load

Safari both vertical scroll works, background graphics load
