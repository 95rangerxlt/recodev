Steps to reproduce:

Create a Sync Account 


Actual results:

MyownName.Surname@myprovider.net
password: L0ng-Random-63-Chars-Length-With-Any-Possible-WPA2-Authorized-Chars i.e. (95 chars including white space)
Birth - before 1990
Clicked Choose "what to sync", then Create account

Unexpected error. Didn't show "Need to activate page"
I retried with 2 new fresh profiles, same error even with a short pwd, some time I get Max attempt, tried also with @mail full lowercase.

????


Expected results:

Should have worked (no restrictions on chars is specified, nor max length)

Solved, I don't know how.
Maybe I waited some hours, then I tried with a password with no ">" and "<" characters.
We had an FxA service disruption in that time frame (Bug 1092080). I suspect your problems were related to that. Marking as resolved because the disruption has been resolved.
