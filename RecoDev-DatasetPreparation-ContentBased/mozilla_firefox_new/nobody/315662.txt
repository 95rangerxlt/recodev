When I go to write a blog entry on MSNs MySpace using Fx 1.5RC1, the space to write the blog has the following contents: "<HTML><BODY><BR>" and the formatting bar for the text is not shown, this wouldn't worry me but I cannot delete the contents of the box nor can I type anything in there.  I trie this with a blank profile but still recieved negative results.
I tried the site on my other computer which currently has Fx 1.0.7 installed and it works fine, formatting bar and all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get Firefox 1.5RC1
2.Goto the MSN Myspace webpage
3.Attempt to write a blog

Actual Results:  
The blog box does not change and you cannot delete what is already in the box ("<HTML><BODY><BR>")

Expected Results:  
A formatting bar should have loaded with the page and the blog entry box should be empty and editable.

Just tested and when writing a reply to another person's blog the problem does not occur.  This box is not meant to have a formatting bar so this may be causing the problem.
Problem still occurs with Firefox 1.5 RC2
Works now, no idea why
