Need a contact there.
Peter has been very helpful in bug 448768, but I don't know if he wants to be our contact for everything.
How's this working out? Are you guys still looking for more Skype contacts? I can help you out there.
Peter hasn't been responding in bug 615799, maybe worth checking if he is still the best person to CC in on Skype issues?
Asking for help from our eBay contacts, as well.
Per bug 615799 comment 26, looks like we have a contact again, at least for that bug.
We now have several contacts at Skype including a primary escalation point, and they are also setting up an alias that we can reach them all at once.

Kev, Sheila, and I have the contact information so let us know if you need it.
Per bug 615799 comment 26, adding Lilian to CC list as POC for Skype, for future reference.
