When composing an e-mail in gmail, when you create a link a dialog box is opened asking for the URL. In previous versions of firefox, this dialog box allowed cut and (importantly) paste. Beta 3 appears to have removed this ability. It is now only possible to fill out this box by typing longhand - clearly a big problem! It makes gmail very difficult to use, hence marked as a major bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compose a message in gmail.
2. Create a link.
3. Copy the text of a URL from any application.
4. Try to paste the URL into the "create link" box.
Actual Results:  
Paste fails.

Expected Results:  
Paste succeeds - the URL should be pasted into the box.

It works for me using a more recent trunk build, but I get a DHTML thing instead of a dialog.  If you're getting a prompt(), the patch for bug 417108 (which went in after beta 3) should fix the problem for you.  Can you try a nightly and say whether you still see the bug?
Using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008030404 Minefield/3.0b5pre, I am able to cut and paste in both the Edit Link box and the "Link to web address" box.

Downloaded Minefield build 2008030404 and I can now confirm that it has solved the problem. Cut and paste works again.


GMail "create link" box no longer supports cut and paste
