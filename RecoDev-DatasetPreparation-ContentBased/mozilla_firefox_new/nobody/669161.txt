I am getting the notion here that Ubuntu 11.04 has many problems...
I get this on OS X, too. I think we are miscalculating something, somewhere.

Issue is also reproducible on Win XP, Win 7, Mac OS x 10.6 and Ubuntu 10.10

Screenshot showing Console’s log section.

The Console’s logging section has the width of the Firefox window, and provides the overly short background or at least its width.
The toolbar, on the other hand, uses a length that is enough for its elements (buttons and similar, and the filter field).

In bug 687153, it is not clear if horizontal scrolling is needed for the toolbar, so there it may be redunant.
I can reproduce here (archlinux).
there is still something awesome about narrow consoles and scrollbars. ON OS X 10.8.

Recent changes to the developer window have fixed this.


Drawing error of the Web Console: toolbar creates horizontal scrolling, background and log don't care (when window is narrow)
