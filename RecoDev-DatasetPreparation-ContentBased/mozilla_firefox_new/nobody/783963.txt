I know my eyesight is not something to brag about, but it seems to me that the filtering textbox in the web console is one or two pixels higher than the clear button next to it. As far as I can see all the buttons in the toolbar are vertically aligned, it's only the textbox that stands out. Does anyone else see this? Is it a Mac-only thing?

You're right. And that will be probably fixed with bug 777011.

Looks to me like we fixed it.
Assuming fixed in bug 777011.


Filter textbox is slightly higher than the rest of the buttons in the toolbar
