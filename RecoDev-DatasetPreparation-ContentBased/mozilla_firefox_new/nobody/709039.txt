Rob?
(can't reproduce here, Nightly + Linux)

@Olivier, which version of Firefox do you use? Did you try with a nightly build?
I can't reproduce on aurora 10. Do you have any add-ons installed?
@Rob: I tested on Aurora 10.0a2 and I still have it with all add-ons disabled.
Should I try to uninstall them?
I can reproduce this with aurora and a new profile, ubuntu 32 bits

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:10.0a2) Gecko/20111209 Firefox/10.0a2
Seems to work fine in nightly + ubuntu (I will test on Mac OS X later).
I also reproduce this in nightly but I now the reason I'm using es_AR localization and there's a coincidence between the shortcuts of Copy and Close, both are Ctrl+C, so is just a problem with shortcuts in my case.
This keeps happening. I've tried Ctrl+C on several builds and here are the results:
Scratchpad closes with Ctrl+C in Happens in:
* Beta 10.0
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/e45fb547926c
* Aurora 11.0a2 (2012-01-07)
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/cd69196df47d


Does not close in:
* Stable 9.0.1
* Nightly 11.0a1 (2011-12-17) (I hadn't updated for a while)
* Nightly 12.0a1 (2012-01-07)

I'm running on Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) (which is not the latest).
All tests have been performed with the same add-ons on all builds.
For the beta and the nightly, the scratchpad closes also with a profile with only about:telemetry and test pilot.

Although scratchpad.dtd doesn't appear to have modified, it could be a valid point to check out:
chrome://browser/locale/devtools/scratchpad.dtd
<!ENTITY closeCmd.key                 "W">

Does ctrl+w also close your window along with ctrl+c?
I create this bug 716495 to fix this problem on es-AR localization
I think this is likely a localization issue. Please reopen if the problem persists.
On Aurora, Ctrl+C closes the scratchpad but Ctrl+W is fine.
On Nightly, Ctrl+W closes the scratchpad but Ctrl+C is fine.

How can I discriminate if it is or not?

Are you using a non en-US version of Firefox?

What does navigator.language tell you in the Web Console?
also, see bug 716495. If you're using es-AR, I'll dupe this bug to that one.

thanks!

fr-FR. I tried an en-US browser and it worked fine. I just noticed the problem for fr-FR is the same than es-AR. Reopening bug 716495

Thanks for the help :-)
