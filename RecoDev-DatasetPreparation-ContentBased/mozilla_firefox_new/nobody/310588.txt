I have a png image ( actually happens to several ) that I tried to view in
Firefox using the File->Open File menu.

It is rendered as a black box. It is much wider than the desktop so FireFox
opens it in scaled mode. Restoring to regular size rsults in a bigger black box.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the attached png using the open file menu
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
FireFox has a black box

Expected Results:  
The png should have been displayed

Opens fine in IE. it scales it down to fit in wth window but it is rendered fine.

I am going to attach the png file

png that is rendered black
Sometimes the pngs that are rendered black in the open file menu are rendered
correctly in an html page using the <img> tag.

I've got a 4800x11000 image (generated from doxygen) that Firefox and Mozilla are rendering as a black box.

However, the first attached image titled "png that is rendered black" isn't black for me.  Unfortunately, I can't attach my large png, as there's data in it that's confidential.
I had this very problem, so I just installed a nightly build (aka Minefield). It seems this issue is half fixed, as I now only get it when I decide to zoom the PNG. After zooming however it now is transparent forever, even if you zoom back out. I just hope it gets fixed soon.

In other words, I believe I can call this one confirmed (and I would if I was allowed to). Also, it only happens to gigantic images (mine is 1117x17931 px).

UPDATE: This problem is no longer there as of Firefox 2.0 Beta 2. Both mine and this image displayed as expected.
I have the same problem with large PNG image 2179x3696. When I zoom in I can't scroll image and next when I zoom out picture is going black. Problem occurs on FF 1.5.7 and FF 2.0b2 (Windows XP).
This is possibly a dup of bug 315263 which is already confirmed and has a more specific Component Setting.

PNG dependency tree issue with Bugzilla: large PNG turns black: https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.0-branch/showdependencygraph.cgi?id=34&doall=on&rankdir=LR
I see the same problem with of size 4096x1600 - see attached.

Opening it via File->Open works fine.

But, when positioned on a page (position: absolute) it SOMETIMES renders as black.  Often it does.  But when I want to reproduce the problem, it won't.

It does not happen on Iceweasel/Firefox 2.0.0.5 Linux.
It DOES happen on Firefox 2.0.0.6 WinXP.

Sometimes it will trigger more often if you minimise firefox, then bring it back up, and then force the page to load a new image (Javascript, create im=new Image() and set the src.

You can resize the window, move the image around (via javascript, adjusting top/left), etc and it will usually stay black.  After a period of time, it might revert from black into how it should look... say 20 seconds or more.

Sometimes, if you can (somehow) trigger the page layout to change (eg use Firebug to set the position: absolute to anything else), it'll render correctly.


Please fix this, its a pain in the bum.

temporary solution

I have the same problems, on a RHE4 machine, running bugzilla 3.1.  Various attempts to find the culprit failed and thought it was just me. 

In any case, my temporary solution is to use JPG images instead of PNG images.  The images are bigger, but at least it works.

Sorry, my bad.  I have provided a bugzilla patch (that uses webdot/png).  
Good Morning from Germany ;)

we would like to report the same .png bug in the latest Firefox-version.
 
We display the background-image by external CSS-Stylesheets!

Sometimes those graphics are displayed with a dark box around.
You may have a look at this example-screenshots:

(Bug appears in combination with multiple operation systems (Vista and XP) and the latest firefox, so we hope it will be fixed soon)
