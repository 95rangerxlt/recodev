There is a lack of symmetry in the web console when handling <ENTER> and <ESC> keys in the cases of multiple suggestions vs. a single suggestion. For example, typing "d" in the console displays the popup with "defaultStatus" as the first suggestion. Hitting <TAB> or <ENTER> completes "defaultStatus" and hitting <ESC> hides the popup and, most importantly, clears the suggestion.

Typing "de" instead, in an empty console, displays the single "defaultStatus" suggestion, and in this case, <TAB> completes, <ENTER> executes and <ESC> does nothing.

I hit this inconsistency because I usually start typing the word I remember, and instead of stopping and picking one of the suggestions, I find it faster (or less distracting) to keep typing until I see it suggested, and then complete it.

I think the <ESC> consistency is more important, because users can always use <TAB> instead of <ENTER> and more importantly, there is no way to type "de" (or something shorter than a single suggestion) in the console if you are not fast enough, since you are racing with the popup. Then again, I'm not sure why I'd type "de" in the first place...

this has been closed since the redesigned autocompletion behavior. Closing.
