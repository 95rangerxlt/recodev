hi Malte, if you have any questions about e10s support for multiprocess Firefox, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
I just uploaded a compatible version to AMO. Apparently, all I had to do was to change "document.popupNode" to "gContextMenu.target".
The new version has already been approved on AMO.
