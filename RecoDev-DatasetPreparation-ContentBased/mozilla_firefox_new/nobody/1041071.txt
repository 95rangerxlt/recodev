This seems to be related to the error message: "Argument 1 of Document.importNode does not implement interface Node." While there is no line number there, it should be related by this line:

    this.boxElem = doc.importNode(E("ehh-elementmarker").firstElementChild.cloneNode(true), true);

What this does is taking an <html:div> element (a template) from a XUL document, cloning it, then importing it into a content document. My guess it that doc.importNode() sees a wrapper and doesn't recognize it as a DOM node.

We can fix this fairly easy on our end by changing the templating mechanism.
I created https://issues.adblockplus.org/ticket/1091 for that. Using a different templating mechanism I can confirm that creating the nodes directly in the content document fixes the issue.

I think this bug was mistakenly assigned to me. It's not a regression, but an add-on compat issue that we've had for a while. If the EHH devs can fix it on their end, that would be much better.

Yes, there is some remaining CPOW usage when selecting an element, this can also be noticeably slow. There is https://issues.adblockplus.org/ticket/2879 for that, AFAIK the last E10S compatibility issue for Element Hiding Helper.
