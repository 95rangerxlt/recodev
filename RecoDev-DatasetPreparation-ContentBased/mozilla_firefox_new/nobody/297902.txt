In pages containing greek characters (eg www.in.gr www.hellug.gr) althought I
can see the content correctly when I print the page greek characters are being
replaced by spaces.

On the same system I installed Opera and the greek pages print correctly. All
other apps print greek correctly too.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a page containing greek characters
2.Print the page
3.See that the print-out is not correct
