Need a contact at Trend Micro to help resolve crashes in their add on.
I've got a service request open, and have exchanged emails regarding it. I'll update some contact info when it's clearer who we can use as an upper level point of contact.
Justin, any luck here?  I'm itching to get on the phone with them.
Added a private attachment with the email I initially got from Trend Micro. This is for their ticket # SR1-1-282061743. [There was also a SR1-1-282513240 opened, but I had that closed as a duplicate of the other.]

No phone numbers, alas.
Added our Trend HQ contact point to the intranet.
