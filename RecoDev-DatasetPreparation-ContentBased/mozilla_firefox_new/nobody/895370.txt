When the InstantFox addon is active in the current Nightlies, it's not possible to visit URLs by entering them in the address bar and pressing enter or clicking the arrow in the address bar, anymore.

STR:
1. Install InstantFox from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/instantfox/?src=external-homepage
2. type any url into the address bar (choosing one from the awesomebar dropdown reproduces, too)
3. press enter or click the arrow in the address bar's far right

actual result: nothing happens

expected result: the URL is navigated to

I get the following message in the browser console:
[13:18:23.904] this.updateDisplay is not a function @ chrome://browser/content/search/search.xml:79

This started happening sometime early July. I can't exactly pin-point the date, but it certainly wasn't after the 7th.

Mozregression shows that this broke with the 2013-07-03 build. Regression range:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=4ffb23062b3b&tochange=b48e06621dc9

There's an Addon SDK uplift in that range that might be related (bug 889157).
Version 2.8.3, which was just approved on AMO, addresses this bug.
