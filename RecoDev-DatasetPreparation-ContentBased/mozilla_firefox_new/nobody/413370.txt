Printing the page renders it as a bitmap, instead of scalable text etc.. This is a regression between my 2008011922 trunk build and my 2008012112 trunk build.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Print any web page to a PDF writer.
2. Open PDF.
3. Observe how the PDF scales like a bitmap and the text is not selectable.
Actual Results:  
The text has ragged edges like a scaled-up bitmap.

Expected Results:  
The text should scale beautifully.

I noticed the patch in bug 193001 was checked in during this time, which may have some bearing.
John, could you be more specific about how you produced each of these? The new printing dialog (as of bug 193001) includes an explicit option to output a PDF file. But you say "print to a PDF writer", meaning you have a fake printer set up on your system that outputs to a PDF file? Did you use the PDF writer each time, or did you use the print dialog option for the bitmap PDF?
The Cairo upgrade is possibly also the cause, since the print dialog has nothing to do with it. It only creates a surface to give back to Cairo to draw on.
I was using a fake printer for these, but I am observing the same results when using the "Print to file" option in the dialog itself. As for cairo upgrades, I know practically nothing about these internals.
I will try backing out the cairo update (http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?module=allrepositories&branch=&who=vladimir%25pobox.com&sortby=Date&date=week&generateBackoutCVSCommands=1) and trying this again.
That didn't seem to do anything, except make everything really, really slow.
I can't explain this, I am getting selectable text and so is some other people according to comments on my blog.
I can't reproduce this; using that exact same URL, printing using Print to file and selecting PDF, I get normal selectable text in the PDF output.

However, neither of the attached PDFs was actually produced by cairo -- they both have:

<</Producer(GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61)

in there.  When I do Print to file, I see output straight from cairo, e.g.
<< /Producer (cairo 1.5.5 (http://cairographics.org/))

So this may well be a local configuration issue.  I can't get the "PDF" option to work in the dialogs as something blows up in cups.

I see how my config could be in error; I haven't been able to try anything further for a bit due to a crash when printing (401047).
I assume the attachment in comment 1 was created by feeding the cairo PostScript output into a PDF writer. It may be the case that I caused a regression in the  cairo PS backend while fixing some other problems.

I would be interested in seeing any PostScript output that is rendering text as bitmaps. It is difficult to debug cairo PS output problems with only a PDF that was created from the PS. It would also be useful to know if the bug occurs for any web page or just only some pages.

If a PDF is created directly from the cairo PDF backend, as in comment 10, the cairo PS backend is not used so you won't see the bug.

This is fixed for me now anyhow.
