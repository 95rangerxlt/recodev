In Firefox 3.6.* if more (then one) QuickTime video is embended on a web page simultaneously with the Apple supported AC_QuickTime.js script, only one of the videos can be played.
The orther videos won't be played until there is an Event over the window (mouse movement / window moving /changing other window). 
All version under Firefox 3.6.* can display more videos perfectly.

Here are few links for sampleing:

2 video:  http://lionis-na.dyndns.org/~ngergely/firefox_bug.2.html
