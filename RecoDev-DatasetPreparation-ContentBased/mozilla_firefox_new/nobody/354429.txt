Obviously, it'd be more optimal if it didn't crash. I don't have a stack, my debug build doesn't currently compile. Perhaps someone else can contribute one, otherwise I hope to have my debug build fixed in a day or two.

This is from the latest trunk build (20060927). I can't reproduce on a debug build, but I do get the following on the console:

WARNING: recurring into frame construction: 'mPresContext->mLayoutPhaseCount[eLayoutPhase_FrameC] == 0', file ../../dist/include/layout/nsPresContext.h, line 858
WARNING: unable to load datasource 'rdf:localsearch': file /home/db48x/moz/mozilla/content/xul/templates/src/nsXULTemplateBuilder.cpp, line 1095
WARNING: unable to load datasource 'rdf:localsearch': file /home/db48x/moz/mozilla/content/xul/templates/src/nsXULTemplateBuilder.cpp, line 1095

Seth messed with something related to "rdf:localsearch" in bug 336488. Maybe he's willing to take a look.
that warning about rdf:localsearch (on the trunk, now that places is disabled) is bug #341654 (which is also related to bug #336488, as adam points out.)

daniel, can you use talkback and submit a crash report so that I can see a stack?
Is this still happening now that the fix for bug 341654 is checked in?
This should be fixed by Seth's checkin.  Please reopen if it's still broken.
