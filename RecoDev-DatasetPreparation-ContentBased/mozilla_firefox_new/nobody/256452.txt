Sorry, I misspelled the Link. It's not http://famile.de, but
http://www.familie.de. Please check it out again.

Redirection cycle detected.

This seems to occur on my system when a page uses a server redirect (a 503, is
it?) to redirect to a page that doesn't then load in a timely fashion.

I get this error on on of our web apps when there are connectivity issues
between our web and database servers and the web server hangs on pages that
buffer output.


"Redirection limit exceeded for this URL"
I get this message occassionally when visiting ebay.com.  I don't have cookies
blocked, but when I clear my cookies I can then access the site.
Is there a preference where we can increase this limit?
Exact text of Alert was as follows.......

Redirection limit for this URL exceeded. Unable to load the requested page. 
This may be caused by cookies that are blocked.


I checked the following.....
network.cookie.alwaysAcceptSessionCookies True  (was False, but I changed)
network.cookie.enableForCurrentSessionOnly True  (was False, but I changed)
network.http.redirection-limit (I set it up to 500, and it still fails)

*** Bug 262673 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The same failure occurs with http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4506296/, which is the
"Savings Sluth" link off of the MSNBC travel page at
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032123/. Funny thing is that all the other links on
that page seem to work fine.
I can generate this on different sites, always, it seems, when a link turns out
to be invalid.

On MSN's opinions menu right now, the link

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6411614/

generates the error.  When I go there in IE, I receive a "can't find the page"
message page, with the URL:

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/?id=3053419&oldUrl=http://www.msnbc.com/filenotfound.asp

This URL entered directly seems to generate the error.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1
on Win2K Pro
Just tested by clearing cookies and restarting firefox.  No change.  The URL:

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/?id=3053419&oldUrl=http://www.msnbc.com/filenotfound.asp

Generates the error, but works in IE.  Cannot test Mozilla from here.
Brendt,

I agree, your example generates the error. But in my example previously, the
link resolves to a valid page on IE, but on Firefox it gives the "Redirection
limit" error. So it is not just limited to invalid links.

I get the exact "Redirection Limit" error that Brendt is....I have cleared the
cookies and upped the redirection limit and the error still consistantly
re-occures....that link works just fine every time with IE....something is not
working properly.  I might also suggest that if the error message for an invalid
link is "Redirection Error", then that is a bug!!!! 
I hit this today going to American Express.  Watching the bottom of the screen,
it was clearly looping, bouncing between two sites.  

I only started using firefox again a few days ago, with 1.0.  Between this and
other glitches, I fear I won't be using it long.  
I went also with this problem on www.msnbc.com search function and I think it is
an annoying problem in an very good software I use and promote it every week.
I hope it can be fixed soon.

Please note that the steps to reproduce I described above are no longer valid.
The page I was referring to has been redesigned. If you want to see the error
try one of the pages mentioned in the comments.

Besides, I want to point out once more that the error can be avoided by changing
the User Agent String (e.g with the extension) into MS Internet Explorer. 
Same bug can be seen in
http://www.hexagora.com/en_details_dhe.asp
if you try to select "english"
I have this error too

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107

I'm behind the university proxy, dont know if it changes something.
With IE it works, i'm forced to submit this bug comment with IE, what an irony.

They all works with IE... i use firefox since 1 year, and it's the first time 
i'm faced a that-much-huge problem.

I am seeing the same redirection error in Firefox 1.0 with this link:

www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3296418

The same link works fine with IE6 for WinXP SP2.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5)
Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0-2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5)
Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0-2)

I get the same bug on Firefox 1.0 from Linux on gmail.google.com.

  Redirection limit for this URL exceeded.  Unable to load the requested page. 
  This may be caused by cookies that are blocked.

My cookies are not blocked.  Before the error message pops up, in the status bar
the messages "Waiting for www.google.com..." and "Waiting for
gmail.google.com..." alternate rapidly several times.

I am surprised this bug is getting no attention.

fwiw, I've seen this happen on a buddy's machine running:

"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107
Firefox/1.0"

It happens for him randomly, but when it does, it sticks around for "a while".
Clearing the cache doesn't help, closing and re-opening the browser _NEVER_
helps. He also says:

"The last time it happened, it was stuck that way, then I came off the corpnet
and dialed into one of my ISP's. It worked fine via my ISP. But, here's the
clincher... I now back on corp net and the problem is solved. It's working fine
- for now."


The page can be complex, or simple (e.g., a simple table on a single page with
no redirections). We've tried a number of things to get rid of it, including
installing various old versions of FF, increasing/reducing cache size, changing
installation drives... He's not blocking cookies, JS is enabled and open, he's
adware/spyware/virus free, it happens either behind a strong corporate firewall
or "wide open" across dial-up.

fwiw #2, I have the same bits as he's using installed on 4 different machines
and have never had a problem.

OS is WinXP SP2 with all the latest patches available.

This bug is the most annoying one yet!!! It can be produced in the left menu of
http://ab-straps.com (the site is not built yet, but the menu is functional. For
example, use the firefox homepage button in red.)

NEW BUG IN FIREFOX 1.0.4
12 -13 days ago I thought I had a "fix" for this problem. I was totally locked
out of a site, and a friend told me that there was nothing I could do about it,
so I reported it here>>
http://jessey.net/archive/2005/04/24/redirection-limit-exceeded/

Well, it's back! I just reformatted my HDD and only have SP1 for Windows XP. I
have tried to get SP2 (which I had just before the reformatting), but no such
luck. I've written MS about that. Might be because I'm on long term assignment
in India??? (am I having fun yet?)

I surfed freely the website for families (reported below) that also had this
same bug, so this bug is selective as to what sites one visits too many times
(IMHO). The site I'm having trouble with is a BB and I always approach it with
Metropipe.com "tunneler" proxy with IP addresses out of Germany. Here's the
site:  http://forums.about.com/ab-hinduism/messages?msg=1266.21

The first time this happened, I wasn't even able to address the BB site at all,
but now (so far), I'm allowed to address the site, but cannot make my replies.
WHAT a pain!

Please note: I have no problem using IE to get there, but I can't use the proxy
with IE so essentially, I'm shut down and out until there is a FIX! 

Gotta have a fix, please, Buddy!?

Apparently not many people have problems with this bug. But it sure bugs the day
lights out of me!!!! Comment #24 

I do not know how many sites now I have been locked out of. I simply revert to
IE whenever the problem comes up -- which is way, way too often. But is anyone
working on this??

I've also tried voting on this bug, but that doesn't seem to work. So there's a
bug there too. aaaAARRRGHHHHH! 

Dan
*** Bug 310537 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Here is only the latest URL I cannot get into -- New York Times!!! 

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/science/space/02space.html

I simply have to drop FireFox and go to IE, uugghhhh!

Where's the fix? I'm real tired of seeing:

"Redirection-Limit for this URL exceeded. Unable to load the requested
page. This may be caused by cookies that are blocked."


I am getting the same error message (Redirection-Limit for this URL exceeded.
Unable to load the requested page. This may be caused by cookies that are
blocked) with firefox 1.06 and 1.07 at http://www.weather.com/index.html

This only happens on my parents' computer using mom's account. Cookies are
enabled. The url works fine in IE on all user accounts, it works in firefox on
dad's account and the admin account, as well as on my own computer. I finally
broke my parents from using the dreaded IE and now this happens. I haven't tried
to reproduce the error with versions of firefox below 1.06 since that's the
first version my parents have been introduced to.
too many geekie things that I don't understand. All I really know is that I
can't get into several URL's. The most ridiculous of these is the "New York
Times."  Sheese!

Dan
Is anyone doing anything about this? I just got another URL was "redirecting"
and stalled. 

I see there are 11 votes for this bug, but I do not know how to vote for it.
Even though it says, "Vote for this bug" just above this window it does nothing
for me.

Dan
I can't believe it ... I got hit again with a new site I can no longer access.
Am I the only one having these problems??? 

Dan
This hasn't occured anymore lately, I think we can close.
