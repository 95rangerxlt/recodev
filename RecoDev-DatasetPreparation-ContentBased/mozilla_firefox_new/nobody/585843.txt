My Firewall Detected as Spyware
What software company is the manufacturer of your firewall that detected the Firefox installer download from http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ie.html as spyware?
Its SecurIT
LegNeato and Tomcat, do either of you have a contact at SecurIT or can help out with figuring out what is going on here?
Sorry about this.

The company's name is "SecurityCoverage"
The Actual Company's Name is "SecurityCoverage"

Sorry
Robert,
The Company's actual name is "SecurityCoverage"

Sorry
How can I fix this?
The actual fix will need to be done by the vendor of the Firewall software since it is a false positive. To work around this until they update their software you should be able to disable their software, download the Firefox installer, install Firefox, and re-enable their software. The vendor should have instructions on how to disable and re-enable their software.

If you could report the problem to them they will hopefully fix the problem but if you don't we will try to contact them.

Could you also please provide the version of the Firewall software? Thanks
It is

SecurIT 2010

from Security Coverage
How Long will it take to Resolve this Problem (I really don't want to turn off my Firewall)
I have no idea how long it will take for them to update their software... see below from comment #13.

ok, so could you possibly contact them

The company who makes my Firewall is called "Security Coverage"
In comment #8 I asked two people that have contacted vendors over similar issues if they have a contact with this vendor and if they could help out. I highly doubt they will have an update available quickly though.

They might already know about this so you might try updating their software. You might also find people that know about this on one of their forums. If you are looking for a quick fix for this using their support forums or what ever mechanism they provide for support would likely be the quickest route to take.
I have posted a Topic on this on My Firewall Vendor's Support Forum

Hopefully this will be Resolved Soon :)
Okay,

It still hasn't been Resolved
