I accidentally deleted the 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder from bookmarks manager. Now if I use the 'star' button in locatioon bar to bookmark a page, the bookmark doesn't appear in bookmarks sidebar or bookmarks manager. Recreationg 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder doesn't help. But, if the previously 'starred' page appears in location bar drop-down list, it shows that the star is set, like it should be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 'Library' bookmarks manager.
2. Delete 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder.
3. Close the 'Library'
4. Open 'Bookmarks' sidebar
5. Load a web page that wasn't previously bookmarked.
6. Activate the 'Star' button in location bar.
7. Create 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder manually.
8. Repeat steps 5,6
Actual Results:  
1. The star activates (changes color)
2. The bokmark for the page doesn't appear anywhere in sidebar.
3. The bookmark doesn't appear anywhere in 'Library'

Expected Results:  
1. The star activates (changes color)
2. If the 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder is present, the bokmark for the page should be added to the 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder in the sidebar and in the Library.
3. If the 'Unfiled Bokkmarks' folder was deleted, the bookmark should be added to the root folder, or 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder should be recreated and the bookmark should be inserted into it.

Why?

3. Close the 'Library'
4. Open 'Bookmarks' sidebar
5. Load a web page that wasn't previously bookmarked.
6. Activate the 'Star' button in location bar.
7. Create 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder manually.

How did you create that?

Why delete? I wrote in the bug description that I did it accidentally. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't ask whether I really want to delete a folder - so it is really easy to press a wrong key.

and then? you have simply created a folder named Unfiled Bookmarks? that cannot work, unfiled bookmarks is a query, not a folder

Ok, then there should be an obvious way to restore that query or create new one.
And anyway quick bookmarks should be visible somewhere after that query is deleted. Maybe an unmodifiable view with all the bookmarks.
Unfiled Bookmarks (now called Unsorted) should not be deletable/movable in the Library at all, and that will solve every other concern. There are other bugs about that IIRC, so this will probably end up being a dupe of one of them.

Can't delete Unfiled Bookmarks in the Library Window- delete - is grayed out and selecting then pressing delete does not do anything 

- how do you recreate this?
I think this bug should be marked either FIXED or WORKSFORME, because of bug 423515

not exactly, you can still delete it using CTRL-X (cut) :(


filled bug 431671 for cut, if that gets fixed this will be
should be working now
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
