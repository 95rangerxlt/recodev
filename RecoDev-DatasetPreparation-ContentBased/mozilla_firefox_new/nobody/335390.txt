Running an applet I get extra mouse events when a button is clicked. Some of these are incorrectly located giving anomalous behaviour.
Details:
1) printout from tracer println()s {Mac Java console log}:-
Mouse released  X 320  Y 373
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) false
Mouse clicked  X 320  Y 373
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) false
Action event java.awt.event.ActionEvent[ACTION_PERFORMED,cmd=Display gain,when=0,modifiers=] on button0
displayG
Mouse released  X 320  Y 395
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) true
Mouse clicked  X 320  Y 395
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) true
Gofile  300

2) Explanation
Note that the 'Mouse released' 'Mouse clicked' events occurring before the 'Action event' show position
X 320  Y 373   whereas those afterwards (which occur wheen the mouse is very slightly moved laterally show position
X 320  Y 395   (i.e. 22 pixels lower)   This is interpreted as a click in the barRect and causes Gofile 300.

3)
To see this in action (there are no tracer printouts in the web version) goto the URL <hrat.btinternet.co.uk>
login to the Developing Atlas (well down the page) [the same thing happens with the full Atlas but this requires a proper username/password pair]
For the Developing Atlas you can login using guest/EPTA2005 
under Currently Available Records look at  EEG
click on  Display gain  (wait - don't move the mouse pointer)
the gain will be shown as  EEG channels  0.25 pixels per uV
NOW move the mouse very slightly sideways
if you have clicked in the centre of the button a new page (Page 20+10sec) will be shown (note that it may take a second or so to load) and the indicator in the position Bar will move to the X value of the click. The position Bar is 22 pixels below the centre of the Display gain  button!
There are variants of this and I once crashed the whole system but this can always be easily duplicated.
I hope you can discover what is happening.

Your URL doesn't work (or isn't accessible).  Every time I try it I
get redirected to other pages (at btopenworld.com or
europe.yahoo.com).

Please provide one that _is_ accessible.

I'm not able to reproduce your problem (I tested on OS X 10.4.6).

But Firefox 1.5.0.2 bundles version 0.9.5+c of the Java Embedding
Plugin (not the latest version).  And your problem sounds very much
like one I fixed in JEP 0.9.5+d (which _is_ the latest version).

Please download JEP 0.9.5+d from the following URL, and follow the
Readme file's instructions to install its two parts to
/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/.

http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/

Then you will also need to do the following to remove the older
version of the JEP from your copy of Firefox:

1) Control-click on Firefox and choose "Show Package Contents".

2) Browse to the Contents/MacOS/plugins directory and delete the
   following two files:

   JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle
   MRJPlugin.plugin

By the way, the problem that I fixed in JEP 0.9.5+d, which I _think_
is the same as yours, is #9 in that version's Changes.txt file, and
bugzilla.mozilla.org bug 320380.


(In reply to comment #3)

I don't pretend to understand it but this bug is FIXED.
No additional mouse events are generated when the changes detailed in comment #3 have been carried out!
I am greatly relieved - thank you very much.
I will suitably change my comments about the Firefox browser (i.e. Mac version only)

Yes it does seem to be the same bug.

Java buttons launch extra and faulty 'Mouse clicked' and 'Mouse released' events in addition to expected 'Action event'
