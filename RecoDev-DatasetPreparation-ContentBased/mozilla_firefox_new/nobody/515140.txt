I have the next draft html page:
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
-Check the <a href="http://clientes.diversiatv.com/documentacion/preguntas-frecuentes#section-4">FAQs</a>.
    </body>
<html>

 When clicking on the link it's supposed to render the new page and automatically scroll to the internal anchor (#section-4) in page but it doesn't.

 Curiosly the automatic scroll does work by manually entering the same link in the URL dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (See details)
Actual Results:  
(See details)

Expected Results:  
(See details)

It's a normal but annoying bug. - I made a javascript for technical support that, after some questions to the user, tries to point to the correct anchor in the FAQs. It took me nearly 1 week to make it work properly but now I get stuck with this bug :( -.

No, it looks to be fixed.


Clicking a link with an internal page anchor shows top of page but doesn't scroll to the anchor in page (It does works when entering the URL by hand on the URL location bar)
