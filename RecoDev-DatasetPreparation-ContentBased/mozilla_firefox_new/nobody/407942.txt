I tried unchecking "Allow pages to choose their own colors, instead of my selections above" to no avail. Works in ie7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to web site http://news.yahoo.com/
2. Click on a link to a story
3. Click the back button; link has not changed color



I don't think this is a bug. I think I'm just not doing something right. I hope. ;-D

It's possibly your history. I don't know if you're glad with the solution, but setting history to remember more than 0 days could fix this.
That was it. Thanks, Ria!
