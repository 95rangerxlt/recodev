I can reproduce on other page such as https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Code_snippets .
This happens since Firefox7.

And I got  Unresponsive script dialog  as follow

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.
Script: resource:///modules/AutocompletePopup.jsm:198

Suspected: Bug 651501
I experienced the same issue with "document.body.outerHTML.".
I tried both: 
document.body.outerHTML.
and
document.body.innerHTML.
on https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Code_snippets with Nightly 17.0a1 (2012-08-01) & Windows XP mode and couldn't reproduce.

Then tried both on the same website, however this time on FF v14.0.1, Windows 7 Ultimate, and was able to reproduce both times.

The first time I terminated FF soon after. On the second time I got the unresponsive script warning, with error message:

"A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: resource:///modules/AutocompletePopup.jsm:198"
Thanks for testing. This is fixed by bug 775812.


javascript console hangs when entering "document.body.innerHTML."

hang, regression
