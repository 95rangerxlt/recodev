Hi there.
I don't really know why that bug comes or if it is really a bug...
But I have often images (<img src="...>) on pages out of focus, blurred. When I click the "View Image" - it comes out focused and normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Do you have a test-case URL for this? From the screenshot it looks like the img container has different dimensions to the source image and is therefore being scaled.
No it doesn't because I have tried it often in firefox 2 and its not like that.

on deviantart f.e. ( http://deviantart.com ) the main logo and the menu are blurred.

Some sites are, some aren't - I don't really get the code ;)
Michal, please make sure you haven't accidentally turned on zoom.

Damn right you are - thank you mats!!!

It isnt really a bug, its just a PEBKAC-error ( ProblemExistsBetweenKeyboardAndChair :D )
