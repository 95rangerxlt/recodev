When a website uses one of the InstallTrigger methods to install an add-on and fails the whitelist check then clicking the Edit Options button will display the whitelist manager with "install" prefilled rather than the host installing.

Bug 307770 only affected one of the 4 calls to the blocked observer. I will probably take care of this in bug 252830.

Works as expected in 20070819_1326
Broken in 20070819_1354 

Fixed by bug 252830
Unfortunately, it is NOT fixed but it has WORSENED.
Now, simply NOTHING happens if you click onto a green Install button. I guess that is not the expected behavior.

Please file a new bug with steps to reproduce.
Works with empty profiles so I guess it's extension-related.


Whitelist blocked extension install can attempt to add "install" to the whitelist
