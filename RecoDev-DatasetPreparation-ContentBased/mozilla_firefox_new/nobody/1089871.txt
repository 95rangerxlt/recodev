I just noticed this says "in both windowed and full-screen environments"? What's that mean?

I don't think we'd want any kind of persistent indicator when a video is playing full-screen, since that would obviously be poor UX. Is something more than a URL bar icon being asked for here?
I agree that showing an indicator when the video is shown full-screen would be bad, and I think we shouldn't do it. The user has requested the video to be shown such that it fills the screen. The user won't like having an additional thing floating on top of the video in that case.
+1 to not showing anything on full-screen. A user has to manually activate full-screen anyway, so they would have a chance to see the indicator before. There is no need to interfere with their experience once they have made the decision to start watching their content in full-screen.
Defer to Sevaan and Henri here, and concur. The idea was to have the indicator within the controls (e.g. when they popped up), but given feedback and assuming we don't have control over them similar to in-window controls, it doesn't make sense.

Revised User Story as follows:

As a user, I am presented with a visual indicator that media I am playing back requires the use of a Content Decryption Module in windowed environments so that I am aware of the use of EME with the media being played back.


[EME] Provide an indication that protected content is being played back
