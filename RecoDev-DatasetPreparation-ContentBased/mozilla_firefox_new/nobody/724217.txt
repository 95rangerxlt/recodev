A very common request users have for Firefox customization is the ability to display either a dark color or an image on a blank tab.  The current (ancient) method for doing this is to skin about:blank, which causes iframes on websites to break.  With the New Tab page, there is now at least the potential to fix this long-standing user-request.  

Is there a possibility of adding a custom class to the background #scrollbox element so that userStyles could easily target it for styling?

Yes, please.  What Patrick said.

(Or to the root element of the document embodying about:newtab, so that absolutely everything in it is targetable, including anything that might be added by an add-on.)
I'm going to mark this one Resolved as a Duplicate:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729878

The new design uses #newtab-window as the root xul:window so anything added by an extension should be included.  Major win for the Users!

Let's rather say this has been fixed by bug 729878. Anyway, good to see it's now skinnable.


New Tab page should be user skinnable
