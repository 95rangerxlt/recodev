Forgive me if this issue has already been reported or solved, but I could not find the exact problem in other tickets.

I have noticed that the navigation history is not working properly for websites using Ajax tech, such as Google's Gmail. For example, when we navigate on search or opening emails, you can go back by pressing the back button (or ESC in keyboard), but this action in Firefox 3 beta for does not work. Instead, the following happens (read Steps to reproduce).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Open Firefox, homepage: www.google.com
2) Click Gmail
3) search "l:unread" in Gmail
4) open an email
5) press Back button -> nothing happens
6) press Back button again -> returns to www.google.com

Actual Results:  
As written in "Steps to Reproduce", it returns to the first page, showing that no action of my navigation has been properly saved.

Expected Results:  
Firefox 2 works fine. Every action inside Gmail is saved in navigation history, so that we can go back and forward on pages already visited.

If this ever was an issue it seems to be fixed in Minefield.
I haven't tested if from Minefield, but if it is fixed there, great!

Thanks for your reply.
