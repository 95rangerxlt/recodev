Pretty much as the summary says.  It may be worth noting though that I was unable to reproduce it when deleting all of a day's history from 2 days or 3 days ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open up multiple tabs and build up a history
2. Ctrl+H to open history side bar
3. select "Today"s history, and delete it all
4. in one of the open tabs, navigate to another page
- I first noticed it when selecting a webpage from my Bookmarks Toolbar, and was able to reproduce it consistently there.  But navigating using the address bar also seems to repro just as well.
Actual Results:  
Crash

Expected Results:  
No crash :)

The fix for 433525 has just landed, should be in a build in about 4-5 hours...
Can you re-test for your crashes?


Cool, how would I get the updated build?
You can either download an hourly build, or wait till RC2 comes along.  I have no info on when RC2 will be coming out..as they are still testing RC1.
