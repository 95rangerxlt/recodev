When the bookmarks toolbar has more bookmarks than it can fit, it places them in a dropdown (>>).  Using the context menu to delete these bookmarks does not work.  After it fails, trying to delete any bookmark by right click-> Delete will fail with 

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsINavHistoryQueryResultNode.childCount]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js :: PC_getIndexOfNode :: line 1078"  data: no]

Steps to reproduce:
(1) Fill your bookmarks toolbar with more bookmarks than it can fit.
(2) Click the >> to display the overflowed bookmarks.
(3) Right click on the bookmark shown.
(4) Choose 'Delete'.

Actual results:
Bookmark remains.  No further bookmarks can be deleted from the toolbar.

Expected results:
Bookmark should be deleted.  Deleting additional bookmarks from the toolbar should also work.

The patch for bug 318052 fixes this bug as well.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
