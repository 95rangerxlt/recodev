The AJAX-Function below works pretty fine in IE6, IE7 and also did in Firefox 2.2. In Firefox 3 This function ist absolutely dead! For me and I think thousands of other Webdesigners this is not acceptable!

function ajaxFunction(postVariabeln)

{

//alert("ajax")
var xmlHttp;

try

  {

  // Firefox, Opera 8.0+, Safari
  xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  }

catch (e)
  {
  // Internet Explorer
  try

    {
    xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
    }

    {
    try
      {
      xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
      }
    catch (e)
      {
      alert("Your browser does not support AJAX!");
      return false;
      }
    }
  }
  xmlHttp.onreadystatechange=function()
    {
    if(xmlHttp.readyState==4)
      {
      rueckgabe = xmlHttp.responseText;
      //alert(rueckgabe)
      
      }
    }

  xmlHttp.open("POST","videoselect.php",false);
  //alert(postVariabeln)
  xmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
  xmlHttp.send(postVariabeln);
  //alert(rueckgabe)
    return rueckgabe;
  }

Reproducible: Always

You mean the links under the header Videos? I tried to find the regression on Windows but I couldn't find the build where it has worked.
I get always the error: 
Error: rueckgabe is not defined
Source File: http://www.steampeax.ch/ajax.js
Line: 52
Yes, the links under Videos. Fact is that it works with Firefox 2, IE6 and IE7. I tested it with Firefox 3 and it doesn't work anymore (the fault you reported). I changed nothing! I don't now where the problem is. The same thing happens on another page using the same function.
I tested it 2 minutes ago in Firefox 2.0.0.16 and there's no error in the error-console or in Firebug.
I 've made some code changes now. They all worked (FF2, IE6, IE7). But not in FF3. I think the response is empty.
Another problem:
I installed Firebug in FF3, but it doesn't work too. I hope you allready know about it. Other users had the same problem with firebug.

Can you tell me the build ID of a Firefox browser that works for you?
Help -> About Firefox and then copy the user agent string on the bottom of that window to this bug.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
No weird, I see the same behaviour with all builds: a spinning wheel but it doesn't load, except in IE and Opera. I have the latest flash version.
So what is wrong in the code with the way of getting an AJAX response? What do I have to change?
I have also found this bug.  Here is a URL for testing:
https://developer.qrimp.com/HelpTopics/JavaScript+API#geturlstring

If you click the Try It button for the getUrlString() method in IE6,7 or FireFox 2 then you'll see a note that says, "The name is Javascript API"  In FireFox3, it says simply, "The name is" because the send() method is throwing an error.

The button is making a Synchronous JavaScript call via XHR to a remote url and returning the output of that url as a string.  I am using Matt Kruse's AjaxToolbox available at http://ajaxtoolbox.com/  

The method that fails is the send() method of the XHR. This method always throws an error, though with FireBug, I am unable to determine what the error is or how to avoid it.  If I call the same method using Asynchronous=true, it works.

When I wrap the send() method in a try/catch, an exception is thrown, but the exception is not populated, so I can't investigate further.

approximate line in AjaxRequest.js (https://developer.qrimp.com/js/AjaxRequest.js)
350 try{
351 req.xmlHttpRequest.send(content);
352 }catch (ex){
353 alert(ex);
354 }

On line 353, ex is not populated and adding a watch with FireBug gives the following error:
ReferenceError: ex is not defined
I am doing my best to find the source of this error, so forgive my ignorance of the FireFox code. Though I have not downloaded the entire source distribution.  I have found what I believe may be part of the problem and I hope this helps someone who can actually fix this.

While testing, I did get it to throw an exception that pointed me to the source file where this behavior is coded.  You can see that file here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/firefox/source/content/base/src/nsXMLHttpRequest.cpp

There are a couple places in that file with special code for sync/async calls. I assume that since this bug only happens on the sync calls and not async calls, the culprit must be in or near one of these lines:
line 1927 avoids the cache for sync calls
line 1956 spins loop for sync waiting on content

The exception that was thrown appeared to be pointer related, so maybe the code is having trouble grabbing a pointer to the current thread.  Maybe it is related to NS_GetCurrentThread() ?  I could be way off on that.
my browser just updated to 3.0.3 and an ajax function I use for an upload site to monitor the amount of file uploaded no longer works,the display just says "undefined".  

It worked before the upgrade to 3.0.3 and continues to work in IE.  Below is the ajax code (I am certainly not an expert in ajax coding, this is the only thing I've ever written in ajax but it has worked in firefox since I wrote it in February and now it does not:

var xmlhttp;
var monitorFile;




function uploadFiles(){
	window.setInterval("monitor()", 2000);
	document.getElementById('uploadForm').style.display = "none";
	document.getElementById('progress').style.display = "inline";
	document.upForm.submit();
}



function loadXMLDoc(url){
	xmlhttp=null;
	if (window.XMLHttpRequest){
	  xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
	}else if (window.ActiveXObject){// code for IE6, IE5
	  xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
	}
	if (xmlhttp!=null){
	  xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=state_Change;
	  xmlhttp.open("GET",url,true);
	  xmlhttp.send(null);
	}else{
	  alert("Your browser does not support XMLHTTP.");
	}
}

function state_Change(){
	if (xmlhttp.readyState==4){// 4 = "loaded"
		if (xmlhttp.status==200){// 200 = "OK"
			ret = xmlhttp.responseText.split("\n");
			monitorFile = ret[0];
			document.getElementById('processing').innerHTML = '<font size="2">'+ ret[1] +'</font> uploaded';
		}
	 }
}



function monitor() {
	if(monitorFile){
		loadXMLDoc('/cgi-bin/monitor.cgi?monitorFile=' +monitorFile);
	}else{
		loadXMLDoc('/cgi-bin/monitor.cgi');
	}
}
Hi

I solved it by changing some lines in the function.
The whole thing with readyState cannot be used with synchronous AJAX. It did in FF2 and in IE.
The function that works now in FF3 and IE:

function ajaxFunction(postVariabeln)

{

//alert("ajax")
var xmlHttp;

var t;
try

  {

  // Firefox, Opera 8.0+, Safari
  xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
  //alert(xmlHttp)
  }

catch (e)
  {
  // Internet Explorer
  try

    {
    xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
    alert(xmlHttp)
    }
  catch (e)
    {
    try
      {
      xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
      alert(xmlHttp)
      }
    catch (e)
      {
      alert("Your browser does not support AJAX!");
      return false;
      }
    }
  }

  xmlHttp.open("POST","videoselect.php",false);

  xmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
  xmlHttp.send(postVariabeln);
  rueckgabe = xmlHttp.responseText;


   
}


AJAX doesn't work in Firefox 3 anymore
