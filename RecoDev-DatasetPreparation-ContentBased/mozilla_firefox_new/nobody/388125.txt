Is this a recent regression or has it always happened. Also, can you reproduce this in a new profile? http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_Manager
It's a recent regression but i dont't remeber exactly snapshot that it appeared in.

With new profile all works fine. But when i delete .mozilla folder and firefox create new default profile - there is this bug.
Hmm... just to confirm, you are still seeing this in today's trunk build, right? Also, profiles are stored in ~/.mozilla, so I'm not sure why you don't see this in a new profile, but see it after you delete ~/.mozilla...
Yes. Now i use Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007071604 Minefield/3.0a7pre

Looks like profilemanager and first run of firefox creates new profiles different ways. And first run creates broken one. It'can be needed you to know: i didn't make any import from another browsers when make first run after deletion.
http://slil.ru/24639224 - my new firefox profiles.
default - broken 
profman - good.

And some interesting info.
With "default" profile firefox shows dialog about default browser that differs from this dialog in "profman".
When i  close firefox started with "default" profile after trying to open preferences dialog firefox process still runing without any opened windows
Looks like problem already not actual


Preferences dialog doesn't work in Linux
