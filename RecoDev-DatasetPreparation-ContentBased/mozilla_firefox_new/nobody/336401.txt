After updating to the latest version of Firefox 1.5.0.2, all my settings reset every time i start Firefox, including homepage, the default browser setting, and some of my extensions come up with a little thing that happens the first time you start them.  Also, all my bookmarks are now gone, and If i try and change anything in the options, and I click OK to accept the changes nothing happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox


Actual Results:  
All of the problems mentioned in my problem statement above occured.

Expected Results:  
Kept all my settings and bookmarks, and allow me to change them.

It seems that even though the ok button of the settings doesn't fully work, it will retain some.

Reporter, could it be that your profile (see <http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/profile>) is read-only ?

I will check when I get home, but it wasnt set that way before, so I dont believe it would be
I checked an it wasn't that.  Anyways, I did a chkdsk on my pc, and somethings in the Firefox folder were apparently corrupt, and it recovered them so all is good.  Im marking this as fixed.
