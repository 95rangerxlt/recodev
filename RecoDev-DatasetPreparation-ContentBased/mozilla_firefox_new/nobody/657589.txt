The builder has started serving up the xpi mime type when you click the download button. Or something.

You used to be prompted to download the xpi when clicking it, but now you're prompted to install.

Right-clicking the download button and choosing "save as" also doesn't work. Results in a 0kb file named {random stuff}.part.

This means that there's effectively no way to download the xpi.

Please provide more info as this is working for me on Firefox 4.0 Linux Gentoo
I'm on Aurora... where this appears to be a Firefox bug actually. I saw the notification bar, but didn't read it. It's the popup blocker, notifying me about a popup...

Which appears to be our own internal dialog for asking if I want to open/save the file!
Actually we're opening another tab to avoid being notified of leaving the page.


popup blocker is catching the internal open/save file dialog
