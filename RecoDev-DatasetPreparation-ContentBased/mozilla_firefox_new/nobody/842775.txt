How can I uninstall update 19?
Please, use the official support board for support requests: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions

Try to delete dwhelper then reinstall it in FF19.
Tried that it didn't work so did windows system restore back to before firefox 19 update... Works fine now, however that is not the fix needed, and is only a temp solution..
Create a new profile with FF19 (see https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) then install the add-on and make some tests.

Does it work as expected?
Another user on a French board said VDH is broken with FF19 too, so users need to wait for a new release of the add-on, I guess.
