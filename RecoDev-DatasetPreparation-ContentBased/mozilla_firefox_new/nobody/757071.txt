1) Visit a site that has a stylesheet with unix file endings. eg https://tbpl.mozilla.org/
2) Open the Style Editor
3) Add a newline
4) Use save
5) Open resultant .css file in text editor of choice + show file endings.

Expected:
Added newline is LF, matching the rest of the file.

Actual:

I think bug 919978 fixed this. At least od -c file.css doesn't show anything weird:

0042000    r   o   v   a   l   R   e   q   u   i   r   e   d       {  \n
0042020            c   o   l   o   r   :       o   r   a   n   g   e   ;
0042040   \n   }  \n  \n   a   s   d  \n
