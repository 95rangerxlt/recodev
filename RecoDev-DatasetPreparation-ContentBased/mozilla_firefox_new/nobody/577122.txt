I can confirm this happens when the new style Firefox menu is disabled as well, i.e. when the traditional menu bar is displayed. In this mode, there's some extra space between the title bar and the menu bar, which lead me to believe there's some height calculation inconsistency somewhere.
I think the base coordinates of the whole window are shifted downwards to avoid the tabs/toolbar showing immediately below the orange Firefox button, but the change is inconsistent in the code.
I can confirm this as well with bookmarks toolbar enabled.
This has been fixed
