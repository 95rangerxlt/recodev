Developer and Inspector toolbars are hidden when entering full screen mode.
Setting autohide to false for them if they are currently active when entering full screen mode would be a great option.

Platform should be more generic, as this also affects nightlies on Linux.

Similarly, the toolbar is not 'autohide' but simply hidden.  Leaving the cursor at the bottom of the screen will not cause the toolbar to reappear.

Given that the toolbar is coupled with the inspector panes, and only the toolbar -- not the inspector panes -- is hidden, this prevents closing the inspector (toolbar and panes).

The workaround to toggle fullscreen, close the inspector, and re-toggle fullscreen is annoying at best.

The workaround resolution of bug 704991 to press ESC is not intuitive or discoverable.  Further, this precludes use of the toolbar functionality in fullscreen.

If the inspector is open in fullscreen mode, the entire inspector -- panes and toolbar -- should be shown.
Since we landed the developer window, the Developer and Inspector toolbars are no longer hidden when entering full screen mode, so I think we've fixed this issue.
