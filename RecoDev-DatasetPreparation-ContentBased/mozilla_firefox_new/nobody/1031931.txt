The profiler allocates at least 48MB of data at startup. It'd be nice to be able to completely disable it, while also making the enter/exitTimeline functions as close to null-ops as possible.

@mbx, is this easy-ish, or a lot of effort?

We can disable the profiler altogether in release builds. In the inspector we can leave it enabled but only turn it on / off when it's actually running.

This patch does just that: https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/1418


Add inspector option to disable all profiling
