Whenever I open a second instance of Firefox (like SHIFT clicking a link) and close the new instance firefox.exe goes into an infinite loop. It uses all CPU power available and continuously writing to RAM. Doesn't seem to do any disk I/O, other than VM writes.

I've tried to close most of the other apps running one by one to identify a conflict, but no luck. Although some apps like AV I'm not allowed to close.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any page
2. Shift click any link to open new instance
3. Close the new instance
Actual Results:  
Firefox went into infinite loop

Expected Results:  
Closing the new instance should not affect the old instance.

Screendump of threads running

A screendump taken after closing most apps.
we don't run more than one instance. you just get multiple windows.

instances would appear as individual listings in the processes tab.
My bad.

Would I be able to get a stack trace to identify where the hangup is?
The problem is resolved.
The hangup is caused by an incompatibility between the add-ons Firebug 1.05 and Splitbrowser 0.4.x
