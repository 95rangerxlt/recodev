In recent Proto theme (still the case with 0.17.1) with Firefox 3 beta, a left click on back/forward displays a history menu, instead on direct access to the page. This behaviour is  extremely counter-intuitive, for the following reasons:

* on other platforms, ff3 beta does direct access, so there is a lack of constistency acroos platforms
* every browser I've used does direct access, why do I have to change my habits?
* I agree to change my habits for a good reason, but here whenever I want to go back/forward, I lose some time, since I have to make additional steps (move the mouse to the menu item of the previous page, and click)!

Reproducible: Always

I don't see this. Your build is quite old. I would recommend updating and seeing if you still see this behavior.
You're right, the problem doesn't show in the nightly build, so it must be a bug of ff3b5. 
No pb in rc1.


[Proto] click on Back/forward should go to the previous/next page instead of displaying a history
