And we might want to remove the inner shadow too.
To see the "standalone image page", open any image in Firefox. You'll see a dark-noised background.
Hi Paul,

I am interested in working on this bug. Could you please guide me on getting started with it.


Thanks.
Sure!

When you start the responsive mode, the background is blue-ish, and has a inset shadow.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser.css#3170
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/gnomestripe/browser.css#2490

We want to have the same background as the "top level image document" (which is the page you see when you open a standalone iamge).

You can see the code for example here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/TopLevelImageDocument.css

This probably just mean changing the background color (not the background image) and removing the inset shadow.

Looks right. Thank you :)

You might want to update your repo though (the code has changed).
Also, can you remove the inset shadow as well?
