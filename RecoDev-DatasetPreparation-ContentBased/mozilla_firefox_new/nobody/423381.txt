OSX has an option to cycle through the open windows of a single application. Using the shortcut doesn't cycle through open firefox windows in 3.0b4 like it did in 2.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple windows inside firefox. Can be either browsing windows or download manager, bookmark manager, etc.
2. Press the "Move focus to next window in active application" shortcut.

Actual Results:  
Firefox doesn't cycle through its open windows.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should cycle through its open windows.

I tried using two different keyboard mappings and with several different shortcuts.

Do you have it set to the default (Cmd+`) or something different?
I have it changed to be the be Cmd+ the top left key right under escape. I've tried under my normal keymap (Canadian French (not CSA)) which gives Ctrl+#, tried Canadian French CSA (it gave CTRL+/) and I also tried the U.S. keymap which gave CTRL+ยง. None of these worked.
This WFM on latest nightly. Clearing nom, if we can get steps to reproduce, renominate.
Works for me too on latest nightly.
