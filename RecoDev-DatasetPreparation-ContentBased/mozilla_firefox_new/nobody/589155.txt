I encountered this and got steps to reproduce, then found this bug had already been filed (thanks to Alice). Here's the dodgy code before it gets included into browser.js:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/e14130b81b5f/browser/base/content/browser-places.js#l1152
the code was added before the button was made removable.

Joshua M , can you now reproduce it as demonstrated in the video ?

> Joshua M , can you now reproduce it as demonstrated in the video ?

This happened to me randomly today. Not sure of a fix right now.
As far as i have noticed , it occurs for once after each fresh start. Just restart , hover mouse , u see old list , then hover again , u get all ur bookmarks . And then it would seem that its fixed
but when u restart , the same happens for first time , and then fixed
Ok , i found out that it occurs with all new windows , so i presume , it has something to do with chrome loading(?)

Steps to Reproduce :
1.Open Firefox
2.Click Menu Button > However on the list next to "Bookmarks"
3.Wait and watch , you See 

Separator 
Unsorted Bookmarks
Show All bookmarks
Separator 
Bookmark This page
Subscribe to this page
Separator 

4.Click somewhere else , and repeat till step 3 , you see
Show All bookmarks
Separator 
Bookmark This page
Subscribe to this page
[YOUR BOOKMARKS IN MENU , IF ANY]
Separator 
Unsorted Bookmarks

This happens with each new window and for the first time , once u see the step 4 , it won't reoccur - AT LEAST ON THAT WINDOW
However*=hover
sorry :|
I suspect some or all of this stuff will be fixed by my patch in bug 592900
*** Bug 601310 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
working fine after patch for bug 592900, reopen if you notice remaining issues regarding this.
