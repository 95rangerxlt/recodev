No new toolbars can be created. Attempting to create a new toolbar causes the refresh throbber in the menubar to move next to the Help Menu



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click on a toolbar and choose Customize...
2. Click on Add new toolbar.
3. Type in 'General' or 'Test'
4. No perceptible new toolbar is created.
5. If at this point the same name is typed again, it will say that such a toolbar already exists.
6. Close Options Dialog Box
6a. I think at this point the refresh throbber moves next to the help menu from the right side of the menubar.
7. Go to View|Toolbars The new toolbar will not be listed.
8.Right click on a toolbar and choose Customize... agian
9. Click on Add new toolbar.
10. Type in 'General' or 'Test' again.
11. This time it will accept it again.
12. still no toolbar


Actual Results:  
No new toolbar. Throbber moved.

Expected Results:  
Created a new toolbar. Throbber stays put.

The newly created toolbar has apparently the wrong minimum width. 
This is a regression between 1.9a1_2005100612 and 1.9a1_2005100619.

I can confirm the lack of any new toolbar, but for me, the throbber stays put in its usual spot (upper right corner).

No, there's nothing wrong with the throbber (when I don't drag the flexible space back in the Customize window). Sorry, forgotten to test the throbber :)

Yeah, I discovered that I must have accidentally removed the flexible space trying to figure out what was going on with the lack of new toolbar.
I believe this is a dupe of bug 265798 or vice-versa. I have a patch in that bug that needs work, and I don't have time to fix it.

Oh well, its not width but height.

I compared the toolbar.css of a before-the-bug and after-the-bug build and the min-height seems to be forgotten.

*** Bug 325968 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The fix as described in this bug (min-height) has landed as part of bug 313388.

If this has not fixed this bug fully, please reopen with details.


Toolbar Customization broken, No new toolbars.
