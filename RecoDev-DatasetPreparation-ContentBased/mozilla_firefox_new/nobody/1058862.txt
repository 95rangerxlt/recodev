hi Blackwind, if you have any questions about e10s support for multiprocess Firefox, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
v5.0.0beta1 with e10s support is now available. Please provide feedback here via comment.
Final version was just approved at AMO. This bug can be closed.
I can confirm the newest version is e10s compatible and works fully.
