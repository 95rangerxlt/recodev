With the Social API enabled, I get a "Recommend this Site" button in the awesomebar. I don't see an equivalent item in the context menu for a website though. A couple examples of where a context menu item would be useful:

 * right-click a link on a page to share
 * right-click a video to share
 * right-click a video search result to share that video
 * right-click a page to share that page
 * right-click the share button to share/unshare

Not to get too far off on a tangent but it might be useful to also have a "Recommend this Site" in the Firefox menu bar, and a keyboard shortcut to share/unshare (for a11y).

The keyboard shortcut to toggle share is Ctrl+Shift+L. Press it again to get the arrow panel to show up. On Windows, press tab to access the Unshare button. Hit the spacebar to Unshare.
I forgot to add that the comment #1 shows how to do this today. a11y support for sharing/unsharing is already present in mozilla-central and mozilla-aurora.
Both the mark button and share have context menus now per bug 818675 and bug 853151
Now that we have a Share button in the Social Toolbar I'm not seeing these context menus. Should a new bug be filed to support context menus or is that not in scope?

I just tried on all three platforms and see the context menus.  You may be hitting bug 878702.

These work:

These do not work:

I see it's working on html video elements, but not on flash.

I'm not clear on what this is, but right clicking on buttons in the toolbar generally brings up the toolbar/customization context menu.  There is no unshare, though a provider could make that functionality.

There may be some confusion here.  The original bug is about the recommend button, which is now the Social Mark button.  So are we talking about that or Share?

Hmm, HTML5 video for me does not show Share in the context menu. For example:

I think the Share/Unshare context menu was how it worked when it was a citizen of the Awesomebar. Was this descoped when it migrated to the toolbar?

Yeah, I'm talking about the Share button in the context of current builds. Where is the Social Mark button so I can compare the difference?

For me at least, that is a flash video.

We cant really enforce an undo.  It changed into a simple flagging/marking system allowing the provider to handle ui around what that means.  Right now, the demo provider on github shows the use.

Ok, Share is new.


No context menu item to share web content
