Actually, IE6 does exhibit the same behaviour, but with one slight difference; it puts the button's label back when the button loses focus (as a result of the 'defaultValue' property being populated on IE6, I'd imagine).

This is all the result of the element's onfocus method being set up to clear the element unless the element is of type 'submit'.  

Mozilla's handling is correct.  There is a bug in the user-supplied javascript.

Thanks to the tech staff, there was a bug in the Javascript allowing
this to occur. I fixed the Javscript and the problem is gone.


The "Clear" button collapses when clicked.
