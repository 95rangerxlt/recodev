 pop yp blocker will not launch by default, "Firefox has encountered a problem and must be shut down". When I click on "rstore previous session", ikt does the same thing about 85% of the time whwen it opens to the same page it encountered the problem on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch Firefox and wait for it to happen. Again, pop up blocker must be checked manually, and as far as reproducing the shutdown goes, there's no pattern
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
launch firefox, and pop uop blocker must be activated manually. Firefox frequently encounters errors and must be shut down. When I click on restore "session", and it opens to whatever page it happens on, it happens over and over. I always have to start new session, which sometimes causes me to lose data.

Expected Results:  
pop up blocker works, but it's supposed to launch by default. As far as "Firefox has encountered a problem"  goes, I'm clueless as to why. There's no pattern to it. It happens on many sites, and happens very frequently.

  i have done numerous spyware/adware scans and turn up nothing but trcaking cookies, which can easily be cleared by clearing cookies beforehand.

pop up blocker should havelaunched by default every time (as it does on my other computer), but it never does. Must be done manually 100% of the time.

  I love your product. For one reason, because so many viruses target IE (among other things I like tab browsing, faster loading speed, user friendliness etc.),and just want to get it to work the same way it does on my other computer; which is flawless. Until these problems began, I was completely satisfied, and after I uninstall it, I will definitely reinstall, although I have done it before, yet did not alleviate the problems.
