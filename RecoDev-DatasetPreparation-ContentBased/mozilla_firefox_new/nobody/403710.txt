Beginning with version 2.0.0.8 (and carried over to version 2.0.0.9), when using the Googlebar extension, clicking on a "search word" (the term used in the extension's documentation) no longer causes the word or quoted phrase to be selected/highlighted in an edit window.  (The feature still works on static portions of pages.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Googlebar extension.
2. Open an edit window.
3. Type a word or quoted phrase appearing in the edit window into the Googlebar text field.
4. Click on the word/phrase button that appears.
Actual Results:  
The edit window will scroll to the first instance of the word or quoted phrase, but the desired text will not be selected/highlighted.

Expected Results:  
The first instance (and each additional instance, as the button is repeatedly clicked) of the text should be selected/highlighted in the edit window (the behavior exhibited in versions 2.0.0.7 and earlier).

This bug remains in version 2.0.0.10.
This bug was eliminated in version 2.0.0.12.
