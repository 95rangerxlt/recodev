This problem appears in GCLI fetched from GitHub yesterday, and affects Orion's use of it.

This is a regression.  The steps below work fine when pointing at the GCLI demo at http://mozilla.github.com/gcli/ , but they don't work with the index.html in GCLI's root directory.

- view the GCLI demo page (index.html)
- type "edit<space>" --> shows several suggested completions in a menu
- click on one of the completions, like "css#gcli-tooltip", and note that the clicked item is not added in the input field after the menu goes away
