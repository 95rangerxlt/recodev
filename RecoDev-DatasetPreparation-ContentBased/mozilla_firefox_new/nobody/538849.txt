i am wanting to use Firefox to connect to my smb shares. However, i keep getting this error message:

    Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (smb) isn't associated with any program.


I hope this is sufficient detail for someone to give me some ideas for how to solve this problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set up samba shares (yes, they've been working for years)
2.set up firefox: network.protocol-handler.external.smb=true, network.protocol-handler.app.smb=/usr/bin/nautilus
3.try to open shares using smb, eg, smb://okusi0/GENERAL

Actual Results:  
Error message:
  Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (smb) isn't associated with any program.



Expected Results:  
open nautilus showing contents of folder
