What more is needed to get this commited?
As this is outside BeOS-only folder, probably it needs formal superreview?
Also someone to commit.

Actually i'm wondering which item there uses both nsSound and BFilePanel,
i thought that already linked libwidget_beos.so is enough...
Also I suspect that only STATIC builds are broken. Is it right?
fyysik, you've correctly guessed I have tested only with static builds.  I will back the patch out of my tree and try a debug build under R5.0.3, then let you know.

what about seamonkey static builds?
confirming fyysik's guess:  problem only occurs with static builds.  Built a debug version under R5.0.3 without issue.

Updating title to reflect that.
maybe XULRunner and Sunbird also require -lgame explicitly
They might.

terminal output of failed  static SeaMonkey build

confirming:  SeaMonkey static builds are also broken.  Fix in 1st patch doesn't seem to apply to SeaMonkey, though, as the "/browser/apps" subdirectory doesn't exist.  The exact same line (with -ltracker) also exists in /mozilla/embedding/componentlib/Makefile.in, but adding "-lgame" doesn't fix problem.  Hopefully the attached terminal output will help diagnose the issue; it looks like more may be wrong in SeaMonkey than Firefox.
try xpfe/bootstrap
it seems we need changes in in xpfe/bootstrap/Makefile.in directly or somewhere like config/rules-static.mk (don't remember atm) to add both -ltracker and -lgame
 to extra dso libs
I think we can fix this problem step by step with separate patches - first for FF, then for SeaMonkey and then, if needed, for other Gecko-based apps like Thunderbird, Sundbird and whatelse.
Your opinion, biesi?
sure, that's fine.
While we're on the subject, should we try to ifdef these for static builds only?

Only link tracker, game when static for Firefox

I think we only need to link when doing static builds.

Only link tracker, game when static for Firefox

r=sergei_d
looks like sample solution also for Seamonkey
I patched pretty much all places, but I've only built Firefox yet, so not sure it will work for other places.

review request.
adding libtracker and libgame for SeaMonkey static builds
in same way as it done for Firefeox
Just curious, shouldn't tracker have been there before? Is that done in some other place for Seamonkey as well?

Maybe here? http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/app/Makefile.in#157
Oops, mixed up /browser with xpfe..

I'm not a superreviewer, but it doesn't really matter since this is a build-config patch anyway.

Bug 313326 requires this fix to create good static builds. So it needs to be applied to the branch as well.
