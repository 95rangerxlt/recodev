STR:
1) Open the Developer Toolbar
2) Go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=767669
3) Type: screenshot test.png 50ms false #header

Expected results:
The download manager appears to show that the file has been saved (which gives the user the ability to open the location of the file on their hard drive).

Actual results:
There is no feedback to state the screenshot was successful. I looked through some folders on my computer and found the screenshots in Download folder (Win7).

Some triage - we fixed this a while back - the popup now tells you the full path.
Thanks for the report.
