I thought the values weren't there. Until someone pointed me that there was an horizontal scroll bar in the bottom. Completely missed it! Could be made more obvious for blind bats like me

Mike's doing some work to close that gap a bit, which will help.  But yeah, some sort of local visual indication that there's reason to scroll might still be needed in some cases.
Isn't bug 704132 going to fix this permanently or will there still be cases where we get a horizontal scroll bar?
There will be no cases where we get a horizontal scroll bar when bug 704132 lands ... or at least I can't find one.
Can we close this bug?


Properties window in inspector has the values hidden (overflow-x) when window is open
