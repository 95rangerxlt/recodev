Ben, are you the developer of the "JSONView" add-on? The add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Ally on this bug. MDN also has a good introduction:

I am, though I haven't really kept up with Firefox changes. I'll give it a shot.

Please close this bug.
I tested on nightly and it works and the jsonview github bug has been closed.

Here is a random JSON from the Internets if you wish to test :)
