Anytime I open gmail, it starts out looking fine, but within seconds, the entire window shrinks tremendously, and the text becomes unreadable. The window looks like it has become a width of like 5000% and the browser is trying to fit all that inside the window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. go to www.gmail.com
3.
Actual Results:  
Here is a screenshot for you to take a look yourself.

Expected Results:  
it should maintain it's width.

Reporter, are you still seeing this issue with the latest trunk nightly build and with a new profile?

To be honest, I have been using Chrome since this issue because Firefox is simply unmanigable with it shrunk like that. Let me try those and get back to you.
Reporter, are you still seeing this issue with Firefox 3.6.12 or later in safe mode? If not, please close. These links can help you in your testing.

Also, please consider using the most recent Firefox 4 beta build, your bug may be resolved there.
I don't know how, maybe just a fix with the recent updates, but this issue has been resolved. I hope it wasn't a simple cntrl+mousewheel zoom fix, haha. Either way, it has been resolved.


Firefox causes gmail width to increase infinitely and shrink gmail to an unreadable size
