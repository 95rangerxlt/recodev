After I change the name of an already bookmarked page, the change is not reflected in Bookmarks menu. The new name is only updated in Bookmark sidebar and Bookmark library. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit a page not already bookmarked.
2.Bookmark the page by pressing Cmd+D or Bookmarks->Bookmark This Page. Make sure that the destination folder is Bookmark Menu.
3.Press Cmd+D or click the blue star from the location bar and replace the name field with "test1". Press Enter.

Actual Results:  
The name of the bookmark remains unchanged in Bookmark menu.

Expected Results:  
The bookmark's name in the bookmark menu should state "test1".

WFM on windows, looks like a regression of Bug 529062.

Could you please check if it's reproduce-able in Safe Mode (http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Safe+Mode) since could be easily caused by an add-on?

If reproduce-able, a regression window would be cool.

PS: notice I've not yet tried to reproduce this.
I am able to reproduce the problem in safe mode.
This works for me using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101102 Firefox/4.0b8pre. I tested using both the Enter Key and by pressing "Done."
I checked again using the latest nightly: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6.4; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101104 Firefox/4.0b8pre and I was still able to reproduce the problem.
I think this is the same as bug 588817, indeed it's os x only and involves labels.
I'm adding a dependency, once that bug is fixed, please check if you can still reproduce in the next nightly after its check-in.
Ok, I will.
Is this fixed in current nightlies?
The problem does not reproduce using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101115 Firefox/4.0b8pre.
Thank you very much for the confirmation!
