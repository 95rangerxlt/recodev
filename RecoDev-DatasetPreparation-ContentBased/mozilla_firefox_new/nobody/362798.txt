Steps to reproduce:
1. Ctrl+click the Home button.

Expected: A context menu appears (with items like "Customize...").

Actual: A context menu appears, and the home page is loaded in the current tab.

See bug 361240 for discussion of the event-handling change that caused this regression and other regressions where Ctrl+click does something other than opening a context menu.

The reload button and back/forward buttons have a similar problem.  Do you want to fix them all with a single patch?
"Lets wait and see how the approach in attachment 247507 does in review."

I'm perfectly capable of turning checkForMiddleClick() into checkForMiddleClickOrIfdefXP_MACOSXThenCheckForMetaKeyToo(), but a world where I didn't have to (a world where I also wouldn't have to personally contact the author of any toolbar-button-adding extension I wanted to use, to ask that he alter it to work with the way I right-click) would be a prettier, shinier, happier world.

Gah, first fix it correctly, *then* make fun of it.

Not looking for review yet, since I have renewed hope that we won't have to fix every single click receiver one by one.
