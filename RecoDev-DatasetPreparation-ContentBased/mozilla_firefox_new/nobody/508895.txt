I want FF3.5 to be my default browser.  This option is failing to take that status.  I had done some testing acrossChrome, IE8 and FF3.5; Chrome took over as default immediately.  However, after that IE8 was unable to "grab" or "take" the status as default browser, and neither does FF3.5.  I also checked the "check if FF is default browser on startup" and it does not... I expect this is related to the not-default issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set Google Chrome as default browser.
2.open firefox 3.5.2 and go to the advanced group general tab on the tools/options... and attempt to make it the default browser
3.nothing happens
Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
FF3.5.2 becomes the default browser

Reporter, are you still seeing this issue with Firefox 3.6.12 or later in safe mode? If not, please close. These links can help you in your testing.

Also, please consider using the most recent Firefox 4 beta build, your bug may be resolved there.
apparently the 3.6 version fixed this.  However, FF is just not working for soooo many sites (Facebook, any quicktime ste, etc.) that I have to use another as my default.


tools/options advanced/general tab: "Check Now" refuses to "take" status as default
