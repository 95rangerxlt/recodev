Build Identifier: firefox 2.0

I have uninstalled FireFox, restarted my system and redownloaded/installed FireFox 2.0. Upon launching the app, from the applications menu, the application opens. However, the main body window apears to be split in two parts. The most visable shows only white, to the left is a thin (apx 20px) window that I can see shows data, yet this is not expandable. Beyond that, everything apears to be functioning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart computer.
2. Uninstal FireFox, restart computer, redownload and reinstall FireFox using Safari, restart computer after reinstall.
3. Reopen FireFox & then close, uninstal, reinstal, reopen. Check for online support 

Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
Opened and displayed web based data properly. Functioned as the previouse version of FireFox did.

If I could see the information I would inform you.

Does the problem occur if you start Firefox in Safe Mode?

Ok...I feel a little sheepish. This appears to have worked. I will do some digging to see how long I should run in safe mode so I don't waste the time of the community. If thats even an applicable search.

Thanks for the help!

No reason to, it's not your fault.  If it works in Safe Mode then it's
most likely one of your installed extensions that is causing the problem.
Restart Firefox in normal mode again and then try to disable them one by one
(Tools -> Add-ons) and restart each time, please report back if you find which
one is faulty.


Page window appears to be split in two parts. Actual page info is in a 20px wide window that is not expandible, main window is white and displays no content.
