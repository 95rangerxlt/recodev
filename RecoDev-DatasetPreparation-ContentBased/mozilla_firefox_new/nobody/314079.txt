I have my home directory on a network file system (AFS to be precise); when my kerberos tickets expire, the next time I browse anything, firefox freezes.  I have to kill it -9 and restart.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a user that has its home directory on AFS
2. kinit
3. start firefox
4. kdestroy
5. browse something -- anything.

Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes unrecoverably.  It no longer redraws, and it doesn't even respond to SIGTERM or anything else.

I can't reproduce this with Firefox 1.0.6 running with a homedirectory under AFS. I tried with both no system:anyuser access to .firefox, and with only 'l' access. Both seemed fine.
I can't reproduce under 1.0.7 -- not sure if it's newer AFS or newer firefox that fixed the bug, but it works for me now.


firefox freezes when it loses write permissions to ~/.mozilla stored on AFS
