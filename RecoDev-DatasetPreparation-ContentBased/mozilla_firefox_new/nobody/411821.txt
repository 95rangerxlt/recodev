 Is Foxmarks Compatible with Firefox 3?

Now that Firefox 3 is in beta, we'll be working on a port of Foxmarks to be compatible with that version. The way that bookmarks are implemented internally in Firefox 3 is completely different from previous versions, so there's a fair amount of work involved; attempting to force-install the current version of Foxmarks into Firefox 3 will not work.

We can't say yet when a Firefox 3-compatible version will be available for testing, but when we have some news about this we will post on our blog. 



Firefox 3 beta available: http://blog.foxmarks.com/?p=118
Update: March 4, 2008: It’s on! This evening, we admitted the first batch of beta testers. Interest in the beta test program has so greatly exceeded our expectations that we’ve only been able to admit the first 5% of volunteers. If you haven’t received your invitation yet, please be patient: it’s coming soon. 
looks like it is on AMO -- thanks for all the hard work!
