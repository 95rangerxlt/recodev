We currently mostly ignore these, but should throw an error instead. There are two different things we get wrong:
- If a successful load has a body of length 0, we treat that as a loading error. Flash treats it as an unknown file type.
- If the body has an unknown header, we simply drop the response and do nothing. Flash again reports "Error #2124: Loaded file is an unknown type".
