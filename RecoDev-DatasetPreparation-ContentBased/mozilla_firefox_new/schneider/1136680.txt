On the final screen of the ad, there's a "disclaimer" button on the right. Rolling over that shows, well, a disclaimer. Except in Shumway it only shows the first few words, because we don't soft-wrap the text.

Tobias, would be great if you could look into this, it's bound to affect lots of content.

Not a wrapped text, but uses <sbr/> tags for line breaks. We missed support for that. Will be fixed in https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2126.
