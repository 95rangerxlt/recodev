There appears to be lots of active work going on to get FF 3 compatibility, even some test builds. See: http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8035
Gary, any updates on Fx3 compatibility? If you need any help, let me know!
Fx3b2 builds seem to be available. I've posted to the forums trying to get an ETA on when the add-on will be upload to AMO.

Lots of recent traffic in the forums. TMP development is definitely underway ... just no idea when it will be uploaded.
this is the only addon in the top 15 that we don't have information on.  any ideas when it might be ready?
lots and lots of activity in the forums. even some dev builds. but you're right, we have not been able to directly reach the dev.
i hope to post new version during next month

great to hear this! your add-on is definitely one of the most popular ones. Anything we can do to help get it ready on AMO? Firefox 3 is expected mid-late June.
Firefox 3 right around the corner. Would you be willing to put the add-on in the sandbox, so it can be tested by folks on addons.mozilla.org? It will not be pushed live to typical users.
Just to add my own two cents to this, I posted this in the forums, but TMP seems to have some trouble with FF3 for Linux.  Here's a screenshot of what happens to the back/forward history button with TMP installed:

any update on a new version?

there are a few themes left, but this is the only extension left in the top 35 that remains not compatible.  It would be great if we could get an update pushed.

The developer is definitely busy with making a Fx3-compatible version, see http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7031 for details.
UH?? Still open??

TMP 0.3.7 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/1122#version-0.3.7) has been released in October 2008 and is working fine with Firefox 3.0.x.

This bug should be FIXED for sure!
