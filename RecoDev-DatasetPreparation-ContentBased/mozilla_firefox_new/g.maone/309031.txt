If I choose both "Clear private data when closing Firefox" and "Ask me before
clearing private data", the dialog is shown on both shutdown and on the next
startup.

STR:
 1. Set Clear Private Data to clear cookies
 2. Turn on both "Clear private data when closing Firefox" and Ask me before
clearing private data".
 3. Make sure to have at least one stored cookie.
 4. Close and re-open the app.

It looks like we fail to remove cookies on browser-shutdown.

On Windows I don't see the "Clear Private Data" dialog on startup though. 
Dupe of bug 307840?
Not a dupe of bug 307840, but related (same cause).
Both should be fixed by attachment 196536 of bug 308384.
fixed by bug 308384.


"Clear Private Data" only succeeds to remove cookies on the next startup
