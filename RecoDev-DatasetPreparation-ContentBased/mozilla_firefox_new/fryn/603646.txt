This happens because undoCloseTab tries to access gBrowser.tabs.length.

Fix 1: move the undo close tab <key> from browser-sets.inc to browser.xul

Fix 2: add a gBrowser null check inside undoCloseTab()

Fix 1 seems to make more sense semantically, but that would leave the <key> as the only <key> inside browser.xul rather than browser-sets.inc.

Pick one, please.

FWIW, the patch in bug 594217 currently contains a fix for this.

I'm well aware, but that keyboard shortcut is controversial and may never make it into the browser.
See bug 594217 comment 6.

part 1: undoCloseTab() should not cause 'gBrowser is null' (checked in)
part 2 will cover the remainder of the menu bar items that either cause errors or should be disabled for non-browser.xul windows and when no browser.xul window is open.
requesting blocking, since enabled menu bar items like 'Tab Groups' shouldn't do nothing when clicked while a browser window is not focused (either because another window, e.g. error console, is or because no windows are open).
Blocking+ for seemingly broken UI.
Notes from the Grand Retriage: candidate for branch fix - not ff4-blocking
