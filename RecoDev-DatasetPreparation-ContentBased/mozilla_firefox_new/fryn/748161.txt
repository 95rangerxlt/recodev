If one has enough tabs to get the down arrow to open tab list, the styling of those
items in the list which are hidden in the tab bar have strange white-ish styling on
linux (Fedora 15, Gnome 3, default theme).
Looks very unpolished and nothing like anything else in the OS.

It's the visible tabs that have the modified styling.
The hidden tabs have the native styling, AIUI.

DarkGray may be too close to the native menu color with some Linux and Windows themes. Can we use ThreeDShadow or something like that?

Absolutely. I just tried it, and it works fine. Could you review the patch assuming that I replace DarkGray with ThreeDShadow?

Ah, that is possible. Anyway the current setup is visually quite disturbing, and something that
I don't see elsewhere in Gnome, nor in Firefox itself.

It's definitely not pretty, but we didn't think of a better way to indicate it at the time given the restrictions of menuitem styling.
I don't think it has to match something else in the product. That's not a requirement at all and is only something that gets brought up when people don't like how something looks.
I've thought of something prettier and less jarring now, and I wrote a patch for it above.

r=me with ThreeDShadow instead of DarkGray

Got ui-review+ from shorlander in-person.
This solution isn't great, but it's better than what we have now, and the metaphor of a scrollbar-like bar representing the current position might come across.

This change has now caused the over-flow arrow to appear when its not needed, pressing the over-flow arrow only scrolls in a 'blank' glass area on Win7 in the tab-strip.

This with 8 tabs open, where before the same number of tabs did not trigger the tab-strip over-flow arrow.
Ewww, another side affect I just noticed.  Refreshing the page causes the tab strip to drop the over-flow arrow, then once page is loaded, the tab-strip shrinks tab-width to redisplay the over-flow arrow.  Visually annoying.

Hm, sorry for spam, only see that happening after posting a comment to the bug and hitting submit, other pages that I refresh do not cause the tab strip to change.
Never-mind my above comments. went back to an older hourly and the tab strip is still behaving strangely.
What do we believe this is a regression from? Bug 626903?
Reason for removing tracking flag:
It's not a functionality regression. The complaint is just that the indication made the menu uglier, which is a valid complaint.
I made it prettier now, but there's no hurry to get this onto aurora just for Firefox 14. It's a visual fix for secondary UI, and no functionality is really being affected. To use a cliché: we have bigger fish to fry.
Well, UI is what users see. Bugs there are as bad as bugs in the functionality.
(Btw, on trunk the styling looks good. All the items in the list have the same styling.)

Gray stripe down right side

The 'gray-stripe' down the right side looks bad.  Is that supposed to be there ?
It looks like a psuedo-slider of sorts, but we know the list is limited so it can't be a slider.
This patch was in a range which caused a Ts regression, so I backed out the whole range:

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/24a6a53c714a

Please reland after investigating and fixing the regression.

The gray stripe is the indicator that those are the tabs that are visible in the tab strip.  The tabs outside of the gray stripe are the ones that are not in the tab strip view due to the overflow mode.
