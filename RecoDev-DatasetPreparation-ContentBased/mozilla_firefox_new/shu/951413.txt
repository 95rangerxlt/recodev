I believe this is a regression from bug 933483
As discussed on IRC, unsuppressing events in |nsGlobalWindow::DropOutWindowDocs| fixes the leak for me locally.

Unsuppress events on dropping doc from outer window.

ughhhhhhhhh

Unsuppress events on dropping doc from outer window.

rs=mrbkap but please file a followup on doing this right (as discussed on IRC).
The patch looks wrong. We shouldn't unsuppress random documents. Only documents which the nsGlobalWindow itself has suppressed.
Though, no one should be able to bring such documents back to a visible window, so not too bad
bug.

But in any case, caller who suppress, should also unsuppress.

Why should documents that get closed/navigated away from keep its suppression state?

Really unsuppress inner window docs on detach from docshell.

Attempt #2. What's going on in the devtools test is that it has 3 sets of
{pre,post}Nest which suppresses/unsuppresses event handling on the same window.
The postNests *all* race with window closure so that when we are inside
FreeInnerObjects the suppression depth might be > 1. This patch loops until we
have actually unsuppressed the docs.

Thanks for looking into this!

Intermittents seem to have stopped.
Looks like this applies to Aurora as well. Is there any reason we shouldn't uplift this to it?

Backed out in https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/773035d73263 along with the other three commits from Ryan's uplift because one of the four caused windows m5 test failures: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=32842361&tree=Mozilla-Aurora
I still hit the failures with this backed out. Re-landed.
