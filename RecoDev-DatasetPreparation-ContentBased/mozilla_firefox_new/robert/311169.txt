fix

Fixes the typo and wraps the call to evictEntries in a try catch (like
everything else there) to prevent the following exception when the deletion is
successful so the button will disable. This was also happening before the typo
was fixed.
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80520006 (NS_ERROR_FILE_TARGET_DOES_NOT_EXIST)
[nsICacheService.evictEntries]"  nsresult: "0x80520006
(NS_ERROR_FILE_TARGET_DOES_NOT_EXIST)"	location: "JS frame ::
chrome://browser/content/sanitize.js :: anonymous :: line 104"	data: no]
This will fix also forced deletion failing on a custom cache directory, as
reported here:

Thanks!
I decided to test sanitize on shutdown with this patch and experienced crashes
about 1 out of every 3 tries when either clicking the cancel or the clear
private data buttons. So, I backed out this patch and I STILL experienced a
crash about 1 out of every 3 tries - so, this crash condition pre-exists this
change.

with the patch
http://talkback-public.mozilla.org/talkback/fastfind.jsp?search=2&type=iid&id=TB10226811X

So, I think the patch is still the right thing to do and there are other
problems causing the crash. I'll look for a bug   tomorrow, file one if
necessary, and try to debug it if no one else beats me to it (please beat me to
it :/ ). Good night.

doh! the links above are the same and both without this patch - this is one with
the patch

fix

Fixes a typo that prevents the sanitize clear cache code from doing its job
properly and also fixes a condition where when it does clear the cache the code
throws an exception which prevents updating of the widget state. This is a safe
/ sane fix.
