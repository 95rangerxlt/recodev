Patch to put about.png into browser.jar

Blake, can you take a look at this?  The fix to Bug 233607 makes this

BTW the diff feature of Bugzilla doesn't show the line added because of ++, so
that is misleading if using that to see what changes the patch makes.

Ben took care of this in the following checkin:
