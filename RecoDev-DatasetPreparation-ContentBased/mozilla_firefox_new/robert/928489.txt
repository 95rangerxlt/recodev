Review of attachment 819175:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Looks good assuming it passes try, please re-push given the change to default preferences.
Also the r+ is assuming that security has agreed to this, which I believe is the case :)
Note: dveditz agreed to remove the checks when we have mar signing and we do on Windows.
Pushed to try now that it has reopened

patch for tests rev1

Some of the preferences weren't set in the tests.

Pushed both patches to try

maybe there's value in having two tests:
1) PREF_APP_UPDATE_CERT_REQUIREBUILTIN true
   PREF_APP_UPDATE_CERT_CHECKATTRS true

and

2) PREF_APP_UPDATE_CERT_REQUIREBUILTIN true
   PREF_APP_UPDATE_CERT_CHECKATTRS false

(in a follow up bug)?

I don't think it will provide any value since there is already a test that checks both.
Try is green... I'll check this in over the weekend

Robert, does that mean we can remove the Mozmill test, which has initially been created via bug 584002?
Just to add, I know that we have to wait for bug 920750 to be fixed.
That is actually due to xmlhttprequest using a fake redirect for the first request and not app update so you should probably have a test for other consumers of that code. See bug 471889 comment #5 and bug 471889 comment #6.
