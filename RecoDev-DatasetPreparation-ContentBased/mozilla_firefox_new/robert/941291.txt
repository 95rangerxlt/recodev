Nick, this makes it so only one change is necessary to create funnelcake stub installers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Looks good to me from a code sanity standpoint.
I've tested it locally as well.

Nick, this is mainly a heads up for you that there is a simpler method for creating stub installers for funnelcake. Thanks!
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f37f1fcd9823
Great idea, but I think this doesn't work quite as you intended. In the normal flow, the full installer is requested with product=firefox-latest-f28, rather than product=firefox-latest.....&f=NN.
Thanks Nick, I missed that was changed as well. I'll add that as well.

followup patch rev1

I tested this using 28 for the funnelcake experiment being run at this time and all was well as well as verified it with wireshark.

What is the '&f=${FunnelcakeVersion}' part for ? AFAIK download.m.o doesn't respond to it all, and it's not used for metrics. Otherwise looks good.

I thought I saw that in the patches in bug 933847. :(

Brian, I know the use of URLStubDownloadAppend and StubURLVersionAppend could be combined into a single define but I'd like to keep them separate since it is more flexible that way.

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): None
User impact if declined: None for users though there is impact. It has been stated that the stub installer is decoupled from the Firefox train model as justification to fast track changes. As I see it this also makes it just as ok to uplift this patch the stub installer. It is also changed manually to perform studies directly on the release channel which is error prone. This simplifies the changes we make on release for funnelcake studies and thereby lessens the likelihood of the changes breaking the stub installer while also making all of the changes needed with one change so that none of the changes are overlooked as happened with the latest study.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Manually tested locally
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Minimal
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: None
