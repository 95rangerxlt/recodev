I've decided to take care of this in helper.exe whenever we install via the installer and whenever we complete a software update. This was fixed by the checkin of bug 354005.
note: since Bug 301073 removed chrome support and it would have taken additional effort to support this in Vista this was included in the fixes for 2.0.0.2
To verify install 2.0.0.1, check for the existence of HKLM Software\Classes\chrome, install 2.0.0.2, and verify that HKLM Software\Classes\chrome has been removed.
Verified fixed for 1.8.1.2 using the steps from comment #3 using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/2007020823 Firefox/2.0.0.2 

Installed Firefox 2.0.0.1 checked the existence for HKLM\Software\Classes\CHROME - installed Firefox 2.0.0.2 and verified that HKLM\Software\Classes\CHROME is removed.
