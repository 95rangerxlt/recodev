Suspected bug:
e7854b4d29ba	Michael Wu â€” Bug 675553 - Switch from PRBool to bool on a CLOSED TREE , r=bsmedberg,khuey,bz,cjones
I've pushed a fix to try. It will post here when the build is complete. Lemme know if that build fixes the issue. Thanks!
Try run for 712729e3b4f4 is complete.
Detailed breakdown of the results available here:

Interesting, the bug was introduced by me as a misuse of PRBool quite some time ago, covered by the fact it was an int, and now it is visible due to switch to bool. Good catch Michael.

r=me on the patch you have on try, that's clearly broken, regardless being the reason for this failure (I'm confident about that, but confirmation would be much welcome)
Also, I wonder if you may modify some of your static analysis scripts to catch this specific kind of failures, there may be others hiding in the wild.

The static analysis I have does catch these issues, but I couldn't figure out how to run clang on Windows. So, OSX and Linux are mostly well checked, but we've hit a couple Windows specific issues. However, MSVC does put out warnings for situations like this (AFAIK).

I just tried (MSVC10) to force recompilation in migration, but I don't see any kind of warning.
Build tested, import succeeds.
