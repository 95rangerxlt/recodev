Clean up nsBrowserGlue.js

The convention is
+          var foo = Cc["@mozilla.org................."].
+                    getService(Ci.....);

r=mano with that fixed.

+      getService(Ci.mozIJSSubScriptLoader).
+      loadSubScript("chrome://browser/content/sanitize.js", null);

Is the convention to avoid indentation in this case too? This seems harder to read than indented version, unlike the rest of cases.
