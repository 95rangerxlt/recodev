If trying to add a new Sherlock or OpenSearch engine fails because of a bad engineURL or iconURL, or even because the search-description file fails to load, the user who clicked the link gets no feedback at all.  That tends to make it look like FF is broken, rather than like the web page is broken.

The preliminary URL checks are now silent because of my change to nsSidebar, but the loading failures should be handled by the search service's error handler, which as far as I know isn't broken.
Quite right; my mistake.  I've clarified the Summary.

Tell user search plugin is invalid

This patch tells the user if the search plugin is invalid. It also moves the install prompt before the validity check, which seems a bit more logical.
Since the other engine-adding-related properties (addEngineConfirmTitle, etc.) are in sidebar.properties rather than search.properties, I think it would make more sense if all their associated error strings were moved there too.

Tell user search plugin is invalid, v2

Does the same thing as before, except more complicated.
This should probably wait for bug 337780 to be checked in, since that patch changes much of the code touched in the patch here.

These no longer apply now that the patch from bug 337780 landed.

Make work after the fix of bug 337780.

I disagree with comment 4 - I prefer patch v1, since it keeps the strings for sidebar and search seperate, matching the code location. If at some point the checks nsSidebar currently does are moved to the search service then we can move the strings too.

Also, if you're going to be using the exceptions in an error message, they should be localizable strings (they weren't before, that was a bug).

This is fine for now, but using a try/catch block for flow control is kinda ugly. There is a lot more suckage in this file, though, so maybe I'll clean it up in some other bug.

Could you attach a patch that actually applies now?

Make patch apply. Thanks for the review!

I think we just need one error message here, so:

+error_invalid_engine=This search engine isn't supported by %S and will not be installed.
(In reply to comment #15)

"Will not" sounds curiously antagonistic to me.  Perhaps "cannot" instead?

This has a semantic string change without changing the entity names.
Reopening to fix that on the trunk.

I screwed up. This one has the right entity change.

l10n-wise review with one nit, please add a localization notes to make the late-l10n impact smaller, and it improves the code in general, too.
