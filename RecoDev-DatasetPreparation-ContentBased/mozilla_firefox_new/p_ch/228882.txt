There were 2 checkins on December 16th for bug 132517.  The first checkin broke
things so that the prefs.js file was never saved if there was no prefs.js file
to start with (like when you have a new profile).  This was corrected by a
subsequent check-in later in the day.  However it appears that the 0.8 branch
was cut between the 2 checkins so the 0.8 branch has the broken code.

This code:

needs to be applied.

Reproducible: Always

An alternative solution would be to back-out the earlier check-in for bug 132517
from the branch.

The way it is now is seriously broken.

Pierre, can you land the patch at
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=137552&action=view on the branch
please?
pierre, see previous comment, this should get on the branch ASAP please
*** Bug 229012 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I backed out the patch in bug 132517.
The same has already been done in the trunk and will be done shortly on thz 1.6
branch.
bug report is fixed.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


The fix for the bad code checked in for bug 132517 is missing from the 0.8 branch
