This bug seems to affect Linux only.
Setting blocking0.9+, no question that this is a blocker.
if it regressed then, is it on the branch as well?
Confirmed. Dai Toyama's 20040510 P4/SSE2 build also shows the bug.
Confirmed myself, as Bradley kindly reported for me.

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040509 Firefox/0.8.0+
(daihard: XFT+GTK2; opt. for P4/SSE-2)


P.S. My build is really 2004-05-10, though the build string says it's
2004-05-09. The build started around 11:50 PM PDT on May 9.
I should point out that if you go to Bookmarks > Manage Bookmarks and then close
the bookmark manager, the Bookmarks menu thereafter is normal, however the links
toolbar is not.
Oops, I jumped the gun on the flag. It doesn't affect the branch (well not as of
Mon May 10 15:19:53 PDT 2004, anyway). Removing blocking0.9+ flag.
I wonder if the root cause of this bug is the same as that of bug 243262.

Well, not quite normal.  Even after I do that, the "Open in Tabs" menu item is
missing.
I think this is only affecting clobber builds. I have a depend build with a
checkout as of Wed May11 close to midnight UTC and I don't see this
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=76261 says this is fixed.  Is that
true?
It seems to have been fixed.  I just made a build with a cvs checkout of:

checkout start: Wed May 12 16:52:06 MST 2004

Unlike builds yesterday, the bookmarks menu and toolbar are populated.
My build of Wed May 12 18:59:54 CDT 2004 has this fixed.
