Triggered by: 	4a7db36c3c75	Sid Stamm â€” Bug 704320 - Add referrer policy support for nsIWebBrowserPersist and its consumers. (r=jst)
Hm, I was hoping that the download manager would just use the default referrer policy, but apparently it's halting the loads?

Does this cause any assertions or warnings on the console in a debug build?  (Some output would help me debug).

Also, see: bug 1073187 ... the referrer policy is not yet being used by Downloads.jsm (but the requests should still work)

Sorry, I do not understand what you request.

Oops, There are two errors in the Browser Console:

NS_ERROR_IN_PROGRESS: Component returned failure code: 0x804b000f (NS_ERROR_IN_PROGRESS) [nsICacheEntry.dataSize] pageInfo.js:607:0

Ci is not defined contentAreaUtils.js:424:0

> Sorry, I do not understand what you request.

Apologies, that was not at all clear.  My assumption in implementing the referrer policy stuff was that any downloads would use the standard/default referrer policy (and not break).  I was asking for confirmation that the behavior is: Firefox does not send the request to download/save the file.  It simply does not make the HTTP request when it should, correct.

Specifically, I was curious about command-line errors (like assertions or warnings) when running it in a debug build.  Sometimes that is more helpful than browser console warnings when debugging network-level stuff.

I see this when I run the STR in a debug build (dumping here so when I get some time to fully dig into this I have an idea of where to start):

This introduced an unnecessary dependency on Ci. which may or may not be defined in the context of the page info window.
