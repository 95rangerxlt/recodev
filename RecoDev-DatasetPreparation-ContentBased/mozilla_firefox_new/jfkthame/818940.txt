OSX showing the high resolution icons

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20121204 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20121204042015

Steps to reproduce:

Set Windows's DPI to something high enough that you can notice scaling on 96dpi images.
Launch Firefox.


Actual results:

Observe that the icons in the Start Page are the low-resolution, 96dpi versions.


Expected results:

The high resolution icons should be used, as on Mac OSX.

Windows showing the low resolution icons at the same DPI setting
Reproduced on the 12/10 Nightly, on Windows 7 64bit.

patch, use the 2x (Mac Retina) graphics for about:home on Windows at 150% or larger

If the design folk want to provide custom graphics for 125% and/or 150% scale factors, that'd be fine; but in the meantime, we can significantly improve things by simply using the 2x graphics designed for Retina Macs when the resolution scale is 150% (144dpi) or higher. Downscaling is better than upscaling. :)

(We could even do this for 125%, but at that size the downscaled 2x Sync icon looked a little rough to me, so I'm proposing to make this kick in at 150%, at least for the time being. At 125%, the upscaled standard-size graphics don't look so bad anyway...)

comparison of about:home artwork with Windows resolution set to 144dpi, current Nightly (top) vs patch to use Retina graphics (bottom)

This shows the improvement we can get at 150% scale by using the Retina graphics; overall, they look a lot crisper.

Could you also fix the search engine logo in aboutHome.js? (Look for instances of `imageHD`.)

Since we're simply hard-coding the images, which means that both data urls will get evaluated in JS anyway, I think we should get rid of the hacky `imageHD` property and `if` branch and simply set the 2x image data url as the `image` property until we get search engine logo images moved into the OpenSearch definition files.

I discussed this with Stephen, and I think we'd prefer to scale the 2x graphics for anything over 100%.

The media query should be:
@media not all and (max-resolution: 1dppx)
Media query operator precedence doesn't make sense. :/

patch v2, use the 2x graphics for all resolution scales > 100%

part 2 - also use the 2x version of the search logo (unconditionally)

Having this coded in a data: URL is horrible! But fixing that is left for another bug, another day...

Yes, we know it's horrible.
We'll fix it in bug 853992.
Thanks for working on this. :)

Just curious, what did you use to split up the gigantic data url into neat ~70-character chunks?
I used a regex search-and-replace in TextWrangler, roughly equivalent to

  s/([^ ]{70})/"\1"\n    /g

or words to that effect.
