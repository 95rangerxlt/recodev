I now get this output when shutting down a debug Firefox build:
{
JavaScript strict warning: chrome://global/content/bindings/textbox.xml, line 176: reference to undefined property this.inputField.foo
JavaScript strict warning: chrome://global/content/bindings/textbox.xml, line 176: reference to undefined property this.inputField.foo
}

That points to this chunk of code:
> 174           // Touch a non-existent property on our anonymous input field. This
> 175           // serves as test coverage for bug 1034682.
> 176           this.inputField.foo;

...which was just recently added in bug 1034682:
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/91a2a519a725#l2.12

It looks like it's non-functional and only intended as a test. Can we tweak it such that it doesn't spam the terminal by default during normal shutdown? (Or move it to a real automated test somehow?)

Eh, let's just remove it. Are you ok with that peter?
Oh, I didn't realize you checked that in, I knew about the warning and would have told you. I'm ok with removing it, I just wish we had a better way to test it.
