We assert that the window IDs for two WebSockets errors are the same:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/test/browser_webconsole_bug_603750_websocket.js#33

However, the sockets are created in different scopes:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/test/test-bug-603750-websocket.js

This means that the code that throws is running against a different global in the iframe case for compartment-per-global. It's not clear to me why we assert this, so I'm removing it.

Don't assert that the window ids are the same when they shouldn't be. v1

Attaching a patch. Flagging msucan for review.
For context, the window id is coming from here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsWebSocket.cpp#1571

which uses:
