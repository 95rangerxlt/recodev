Hi everyone
Using firefox 2.0.0.2 on Linux with maps.google.com makes the browser and Xorg eat all available memory in few minutes bringing the system to a crawl.
The same firefox version on Windows limits the memory usage to about 50 MB only.

No browser.cache.memory.xyz tweaking on both systems

System info: 1 GB of RAM and 1/2 GB of swap

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to maps.google.com
2. using hybrid/satellite map mode
3. move around the map for about 3-4 minutes zooming to some area 

Actual Results:  
all available memory including swap is being taken over by firefox and Xorg.
If you keep using google maps system is slowing to a crawl

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have limited the memory usage to some level

I'm also seeing this with Linux Iceweasel 2.0.0.1.

I noticed something about "reclaiming memory from circularly-linked data structures" in the 3.0 pre-release-notes, and wondered if it could be related to this.  But that would be cross-platform; does this really not affect windows?

The previous firefox version (1.5.x) does not have this problem
seeing this behavior in latest minefield trunk build.

I guess it'd help to add am running on Ubuntu Feisty 7.04, X.Org version 7.2
It might relates to bug 311130. I'm developing a google-maps-like engine and I can confirm this leak/memory issue relates to images loaded within javascript. Had to switch to alternative browser as it was making XOrg's memory grow to 300megs+

Opera on linux does nothing wrong to X when surfing google maps.

test; hit 'eat, eat more' button cyclically to increase both X and Firefox memory usage.

We don't block on unconfirmed bugs, please renom once confirmed.
FYI, after further testing, it seems xorg memory problem is caused by firebug itself or interaction between fb+ff. Once this extension is disabled, xorg memory consumption goes back to normal on pages like maps.google.com.
> memory problem is caused by firebug

Well spotted!  Yes, I also find that the problem goes away when Firebug is disabled.

There is a Firebug bug filed here:
http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=34&q=images

It shows a temporary solution without having to turn Firebug entirely off.
Firebug fixed in version 1.1.0, please close this report.


firefox (and Xorg as a consequence) eat all available memory with google maps
