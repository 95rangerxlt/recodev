When I went to play a flash game, I was told I needed to install it, and that
Firefox would search for it. So it did, and it found Flash Player 6.0.x, when
the current version out is 7.x. This may cause anger in some people, especially
those new to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a site that requires flash, without having flash installed in Firefox
already
2.Let Firefox search for the flash plugin
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox prompted the download of Flash Player 6.0.x

Expected Results:  
Firefox should've prompted the download of 7.0.x

This appears to have been fixed in newer downloads of 1.0 PR. Bug FIXED
