Sidebar item padding

Selected items in the browser sidebar now have padding on either side where they aren't supposed to. They should be pressing up against the sides.

Looks to be from bug 432115

#sidebar,
sidebarheader { 
  background-color: #d4dde5;
  padding: 2px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

Adds padding with the color.

Padding fix

Separate the rules so we can color the background without adding padding. Also
removed the text-transform: uppercase since it doesn't work anyway(bug 101800).
