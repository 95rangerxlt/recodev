Based on the new install flow we need icons to represent the states of the install with icons. The flow and all icons required are shown in attachment 8578019
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8578019

These icons are:
- add-on
- download add-on
- add-on not active (need restart)
- add-on installed successfully
- add-on installation error
