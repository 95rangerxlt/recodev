I need icons for bug 1031019. I assume we just want to use the Marketplace "Rocket" icon.

The list of what I need is:
browser/themes/linux/Toolbar.png (18x18)
browser/themes/linux/Toolbar-inverted.png (18x18 inverted)
browser/themes/linux/menuPanel.png (32x32)

browser/themes/windows/Toolbar.png (18x18)
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-inverted.png (18x18 inverted)
browser/themes/windows/menuPanel.png (32x32)

browser/themes/osx/Toolbar.png (18x18 "pressed" and "unpressed" icons)
browser/themes/osx/Toolbar@2x.png (36x36 "pressed" and "unpressed" icons)
browser/themes/osx/Toolbar-inverted.png (18x18 "pressed" and "unpressed" inverted icons)
browser/themes/osx/Toolbar-inverted@2x.png (36x36 "pressed" and "unpressed" inverted icons)
browser/themes/osx/menuPanel.png (32x32)
browser/themes/osx/menuPanel@2x.png (64x64)
browser/themes/osx/menuPanel-yosemite.png (32x32 yosemite)
browser/themes/osx/menuPanel-yosemite@2x.png (64x64 yosemite)

Caitlin, do you have some Marketplace raw assets we can use for this?

Philipp, can someone on the UX team help me get these modified images?

NI Tony Santos - our head of UX / Design
Are we asking PWalm?

Stephen, this sounds like a job for our glorious new SVG tool!
I have the icon as a vector graphic, but having never made graphics for this purpose before I have a few questions before I can spit it out as the 14 PNGs requested above. Is there a required background color or are transparent pixels allowed? All the icons in the menu currently appear to have some kind of inner-shadow effect, is this automatically applied or do I need to recreate it? If so, what are the specs of that effect?
I forgot to mention some Windows variants in comment 0:
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-aero.png
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-lunaSilver.png
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-XP.png
browser/themes/windows/menuPanel-aero.png
Stephen said he'd work on this and get it by next week. Tony, I imagine he'll be pinging you for the raw asset if he needs it.

(Had to rename the yosemite images, but this was perfect otherwise.)
Hi Stephen, can you provide a point value for this work.
