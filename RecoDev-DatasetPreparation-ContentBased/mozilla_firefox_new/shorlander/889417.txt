new firefox icon with the other browsers' icon

The new Firefox icon on the Windows taskbar is smaller than the old icon and the other browsers' icon. I'm not sure if this is intentional, though.

I think that the new icon should be a little bit larger than current Beta's icon because the color became lighter. So, the contrast between the icon and taskbar may become lower. Therefore, perhaps, larger icon might look better.

Steven: should we make the logo bigger?
This is not Windows specific, I see a smaller-than-our-old-logo on Mac too.

The 16x16 icon is still one pixel shorter than the old icon, and you can see the difference in comparison to the other icons in the taskbar.

As per comment 13, I also confirm that the Firefox icon is still shorter: http://oi44.tinypic.com/k00qvk.jpg. Is this intended? 
If yes, I confirm the fix on Firefox 24 beta 7 (Build ID: 20130829135643).
Can anyone please answer my question in comment 14 ?

Needinfo requests that don't have a specific requestee will be ignored. You need to always set a requestee.

Stephen can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the height difference in comment 14 matters.
