Martell did a fantastic update of the Nightly planet a while back, but looks like we're only using that in the stub installer.

Compare:

https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/nightly/bgintro.bmp

with

https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/nightly/content/about-background.png

The old style Nightly planet has pale-yellow glowy simple dots representing cities along transit lines, whereas the new Nightly planet has more orangeish cities, with paths that are more gradienty. Yes, gradienty.

It would be nice to update all the Nightly branding with this change, it's all under https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/nightly/

We could do this as a series of steps to spread out the work, if that helps. Should just be all straight-up image replacements, but there are a number of visual variations in the branding, as well as multiple image formals to deal with (png, bmp, icns, etc). So, trivial in general but a little tedious to actually _do_.

I've also filed bug 734133 concerning new icons some time ago.

Nightly Icon Update Sheet

I started working on this a while back and finished almost all of the Nightly icon update. Things slowed down a little trying to get the correct rendering for 32x32 and 16x16 versions.

I might be able to get back on it soon-ish but if someone else wants to take it on in the mean time I can post what I have so far.

This is the only change that's slightly more than purely visual, but seems fine. (Shouldn't be any L10N impact, since I don't expect the OS localizes the folder name due to compatibility impact.)

Aaaaactually. Looking at bug 320155 (which originally implemented this), it seem that OS X might be using a way to localize displayed folder names. Not sure if that's actually the case, or what happens with symlinks in DMGs, so let's consider this in a separate bug.

Modified Binary File: browser/branding/aurora/disk.icns

Modified Binary File: browser/branding/aurora/firefox.icns

These files gained around 4MB total (ditto for the other branding flavors), with most (970K) of that being in the 1024x1024 (512x512@2x) version within. I'm a bit concerned about the impact on download size -- it's a lot of overhead for something that would rarely be seen at full-res, and has a direct impact on the download funnel.

How about removing the largest size?

Hmm. I'm increasingly wary about changing this, because it can have a bunch of side-effects.

Let's go ahead and land the updated image assets, but leave the name change (in branding.nsi and configure.sh) for a separate bug. Probably the same bug for changing the default build to use unofficial branding instead of nightly.

While I agree we should not bloat our file size as much as possible I think to some extent it's just the cost of Retina. As a larger problem this now affects any bitmap we add to the product. Branding is just especially bad because it has so much artwork.

My proposal is we keep the largest size (512 x 512 @2x) for the application icon but remove the other @2x sizes since they are just copies of the 1x sizes. Not entirely sure how OS X handles this but it seems to work without fuzziness here.

For the document icons I agree we can probably remove the largest size (maybe all of the @2x sizes?) since it probably won't ever be seen at a large size.

Update Nightly Branding - 05 - Part 1

Ok, updated the .icns files.

- Remove all but the largest @2x icon
- Saved them with JPEG 2000 instead of PNG

OS X seems to just do the right thing without all of the @2x icons; i.e. it picks 32x32 instead of 16x16 on Retina displays. The encoding is slightly lossy but not that noticeable and seems to be a worthwhile trade WRT to file size.

Reverted BrandFullNameInternal. Left the updated image for the stub installer though.

I'd prefer to do this in the other patch as well, just because I haven't looked through to see if there are surprises from doing this.
