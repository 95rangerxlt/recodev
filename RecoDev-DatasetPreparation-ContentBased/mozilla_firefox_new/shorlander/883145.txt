Unaligned Gradients

Going into customization mode is jarring partly because of perf and partly because the appearance shifts. Is it possible to use the actual window texture/gradient instead of switching to another CSS simulated gradient?

Some notes, since I was editing this recently.

The files you'll want to change are probably
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/linux/browser.css#2007 and
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#4137
to make the customize-mode gradient more like the default gradient, I think…
