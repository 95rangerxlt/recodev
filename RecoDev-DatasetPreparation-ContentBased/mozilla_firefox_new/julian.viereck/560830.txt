Currently, when highlighting with the mouse inside a highlighter panel, the scroll wheel does nothing. The document should scroll when a user moves the wheel or uses a scrolling gesture.

Hello Julian!

This is my patch feedback.


In inspector.js:

+    if (aEvent.axis == aEvent.HORIZONTAL_AXIS) {
+      win.scrollBy(aEvent.detail, 0);
+    }
+    else {
+      win.scrollBy(0, aEvent.detail);
+    }

The inspector.js code uses "} else {" without \n, and this is recommended by the 
MDN style guide actually.


In the test file:

+  content.location = "data:text/html,iframe tests for inspector";

I believe you should say "mouse scroll tests". The bug fix you implemented is 
related not only to frames, it also makes mouse scroll to work in normal pages 
without any frames when the panel overlay is on top.


Again, in the test file:
+function runIframeTests(aEvt)
+function performScrollingTest(aEvt)

Why not use aEvent?

Also, the test code uses a mix of single and double quotes. I believe you should 
use only double quotes.


+    let iFrameDoc = iframe.contentDocument;

I think that should be consistent with the rest of the naming used. Maybe 
iframedoc? Or iframeDoc.


+  is (iframe.contentDocument.body.scrollTop, 50, "inspected iframe scrolled");

I think you should make that "is(" instead of "is (".

That's about all. I really like your fix and test code! You get feedback+ from 
me with the changes I suggested.

Can't you just use elementFromPoint().ownerDocument.defaultView instead?
