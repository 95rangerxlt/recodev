Disables "Remove All Cookies" button when no cookies exist.

New code disables "Remove All Cookies" button when no cookies exist after either "Remove Cookies" or "Remove All Cookies" buttons are pressed.

Disables "Remove All Cookies" button when no cookies exist.

This dialog deals with dynamic changes to the cookie store while it's open, so you can't just do this in the button actions. See e.g. _handleCookieAdded and the "observe" method.

You'd need to make sure you update the button correctly when cookies are otherwise added/removed.

Disables button "Remove All Cookies" when populating list view and when the list is cleared. Using the Observe method.

Re-enables it when there ia, at least, 1 item at the cookies list.

Overall approach looks good. r+ with the following changes.

_handleCookieAdded already updates the disabled state of the removeAllCookies button. Can you update the _handleCookieAdded function to also check for this._view._rowCount when setting the disabled property?

These lines should be moved inside of populateList and combined with the code that was added there. Further, this could be simplified by doing
|document.getElementById("removeAllCookies").disabled = this._view._rowCount == 0;|

Nit: please remove these curly brackets now since they are unnecessary. Sorry for not mentioning it earlier when I requested the refactoring.

Done. I should have realize about that earlier.
Those failures seem innocuous. JetPack builds seem to fail all the time for some reason.

I've fixed the last remaining nit and pushed to the fx-team repository. This patch should land in mozilla-central in a day or two.

Thanks for your contribution!
