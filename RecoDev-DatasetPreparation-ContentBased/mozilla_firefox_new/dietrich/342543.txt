Responses to bug 342142 indicated that there's also problem with canceling the prompt on multiple platforms.

I am able to reproduce the problem on a Mac, and ispiked is able to reproduce on linux.

I'm getting an exception from the prompt service:

TypeError: this.getTabBrowser() has no properties

Here's where the exception is caught:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStartup.js#272

The promptService.confirmEx() call is what throws the exception. I can't reproduce in an isolated prompt, so it must be related to the session restore code somehow.

I am seeing this as well on Mac with 2006062404 on the Bon Echo branch. This worked fairly recently, so I'm wondering if this is fallout from the checkin for bug 254021 or another session-service change in the past week or so. If it would be helpful, I can try to narrow down the regression window. 

Setting OS to All/All. 
The crash I'm seeing is bug 341595. Don't know if that's true for everyone else...

safebrowsing should try to watch null browsers

So, this is most likely not the way to handle this, but it fixes the problem. The safebrowsing peeps should look at this and determine the proper fix.
Does this happen on all macs?  I'll try to repro today and have a proper fix.
Tony,

I see it both of my Macs. Thanks for looking into it.
The attached patch does not fix this bug. Sessions are still restored even when the cancel button is pressed.

Hey Zach,

Which OS?

Also, can you try Tony's patch in bug 339416 to see if it works for you? Both of the patches solved this problem for me on Mac.
Platform is mac and I'm using the branch. I'm reproducing the problem with:

1. Launch, open up some pages in various tabs
2. kill -HUP firefox_PID
3. Relaunch
4. Hit cancel

The pages I had open in step 1 open up again, even though the session shouldn't be restored.

I'll try the patch in bug 339416.
I lie. The patch does work...
Should be fixed with the patch on bug 339416.
Tested latest branch build, and this is fixed.
