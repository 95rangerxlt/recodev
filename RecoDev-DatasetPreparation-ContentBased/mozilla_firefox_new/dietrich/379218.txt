The moz_annos table is created w/o the type column; worst, the tests pass because we apparently run migration code for new profiles (should I file that separately?)

I don't think to test this given that the fix here is mainly for correctness, and that your test would pass regardless of this patch.

Also, I would bet that various tests in test_annotations.js would fail if the annotations table doesn't have the type column.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
