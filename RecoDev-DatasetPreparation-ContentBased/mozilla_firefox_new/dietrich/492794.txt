instead of hitting the annotation db every time, the service should cache the list of bookmark ids that are microsummarized, and use an annotation observer to manage the cache.

there's some error right now after deleting a microsummarized bookmark, so not ready for review yet.

i do know you're famous and unique, but adding last name could be a good idea :)

since you changed name from _getbookmarks to _bookmarks the comment "of this method" does not make much sense (which method?)

those don't look like place ids, not as we inted in Places at least. should be bookmark itemIds or bookmark ids

while here, param should be called aBookmarkID
why checking > -1 instead of the usual != -1? Looking around in mxr i see != -1 is the most used style.

i would prefer having a temp var for isMicrosummaryAnnotation, or better indentation.

r=me with those fixed

asking pre approval, reduces queries load due to microsummary service, every time we check if a bookmark has a microsummary.
