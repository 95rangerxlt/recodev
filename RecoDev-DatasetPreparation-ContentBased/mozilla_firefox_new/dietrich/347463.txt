When the feed or lock icons are displayed in the location bar, the height of the location bar increases.  Open a site without any extra icons (such as http://www.google.com/) in one tab, and open a site with a feed icon (such as http://www.mozilla.org) in another tab.  Switch between the two tabs.  Notice how the location bar grows and shrinks vertically.  Ew.

One particularly nasty manifestation of this bug is that the page proxy icon (favicon) will expand to 16x18px when the feed or lock icons are also displayed in the location bar.  The proxy icon appears stretched vertically.  This is nasty.

Fig. 1. Location bar stretched vertically due to lock icon, note the scaled favicon

This shot from a Gmail login screen makes it easy to see the problem.  It shows the Google favicon stretched to 16x18px in the location bar, but at its normal 16x16px size in the search bar.
Must be an issue with the pinstripe changes, I don't see this on windows.

fix

i initially just set a max-height on the favicon, but this caused the feed icon to be smushed, which uncovered the real problem: the image regions were incorrect for the feed icon.

the patch sets the proper image regions, and also sets a min-height for the feed icon and a max-height for the favicon to make things less fragile. however, are max/min sizes not enforced here for a reason that i'm not seeing?
It's probably best to tweak the images, rather than changing the region boundaries to not be multiples of 18px.

>   list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/livemark-item.png");
>-  -moz-image-region: rect(0px, 36px, 18px, 18px);
>+  -moz-image-region: rect(1px, 36px, 17px, 18px);
>+  min-height: 16px;

is the min-height needed?

I'm not sure if we're using 18px elsewhere, so fixing image regions seems like the best path forward.
