It's probably not necessary to copy this file exactly - any "invalid" file will do, so an xml file that is empty or is gibberish would be sufficient

These lines have been treated as boilerplate but they're only necessary for testing JAR-loaded plugins - so they shouldn't be necessary here.

r=me with those addressed, sorry for the delay.
