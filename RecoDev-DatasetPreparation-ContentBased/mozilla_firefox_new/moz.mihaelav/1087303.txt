This is a follow up of bug 947914, but for the remaining buttons: preferences, fullscreen and new 10s window.

Steps:
1. Start Firefox
2. Open the Panel Menu
3. Click on "New E10 Window", "Fullscreen" and "Preferences" buttons in the Panel Menu

Expected result:
Each button should perform the right corresponding action

When I'm trying to access the "New E10s window" button from a browser-chrome test the button is not found, although it exists there if I manually check it (for the same build). Can someone give a hint on why I can't access that button in the test, please?
Thanks!

Hey Mihaela - I actually recommend not testing the New E10s window button, since this button is not supposed to make it to release. It's temporary while we do nightly testing of E10s.

Can we please skip-if = os == "mac" in browser.ini instead? :-)

This will fail on e10s. I'm enabling these tests in e10s mode by default in bug 1080787. Please test this some other way, like by checking the selectedBrowser's currentURI. :-)

Why do you need to add a new tab?

No need to save the value, use Services.prefs.clearUserPref(PREF_INCONTENT) instead.

You're waiting for load, but this says tabselect? That doesn't sound right...
Just a drive-by note while looking through try for unrelated reasons:
The bug number in this patch is incorrect, and should be fixed before this lands.

If only one (about:blank) tab is opened when the test starts, the about:preferences page will load in that tab, and when I close it at the end, it closes the browser.
I added a check for gBrowser.tabs.length == 1 and added an about:blank tab if true, instead.

Also updated the bug number in the patch, thanks for the notice.
