A tracking bug for the 1.0.3 security audit work and the fixes for the related
security bugs.
Marking blocking-aviary1.0.3+.
First thing's first: caillon will put together a draft of the list of things
that need to be checked for in the code and suggestions for how to fix them. 
After that, we'll create a list of places to check for rude behaviour in the
code.  The audit will use these two lists and should take an estimated 24-36 hours.
