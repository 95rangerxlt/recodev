"those related to it" does not really make clear which ones they are, I could not tell learnmore or removefile are "related" to unblock.
what about adding a very simple oneline note like
"note: this string doesn't yet exist in the UI. See bug 1053890."
to _each_ of the localization notes instead?
all of these notes will be removed on landing so shouldn't be a big deal and the bug can contain enough information.

how can text be shown _as_ a command "icon"? did you mean "as label of a command icon", or as a tooltip?

nit: sometimes you added a new line before each block of string, sometimes not, please make it coherent. Since these strings are related you could just newline before and after them, not in between.

I wonder if some localization would want to append it rather than prefix it (in such a case should be moved to properties and have a %S). I'm not sure if such a problem may exist in some locale, it's clear our intent here is to make this very visible and thus keep it prefixed in both ltr and rtl. Since I didn't look at the code, please ensure won't be problematic to manage this as a dtd entity for rtl locales (thus that "before" is indeed what happens in both modes)

"they _must_ end with a period."

I'd also oneline this note and dupe it below in the other localization note

This addresses the review comments, while the final wording and styles are being worked on in bug 1053890.

That's the goal, we should do so ASAP.

Does this mean someone is available to take bug 1062966 during this iteration? If we don't end up implementing this blocker in time, and we don't enable Application Reputation in Firefox 34 anyways, there's little point in uplifting the strings.

Not by me, I'm sorry. The backend for this was significantly more complicated than existing Safebrowsing checks and I burned out on writing it without implementation assistance.

Sorry to hear that. The whole project definitely turned out to be much more complicated than anyone expected. The fact is, as I already mentioned to Gavin, that the unblock mechanism is not a trivial chunk of work as well. Since I know you've been keeping track of the project, my needinfo request wasn't suggesting you should do the work yourself, but rather an invitation to discuss with Gavin about what the release plan for the feature could realistically look like, based on the people available to work on it.

I'm working on higher priority Firefox 34 Loop bugs at the moment, so I'll only be able to provide reviews, but I won't be able to do active development.
Thanks Paolo, I understand and in the same boat. I'll talk to Gavin.

This patch isn't a good candidate for uplift:

1. We don't take string changes on Aurora and this patch is entirely string changes.
2. As per comment 10 and comment 11 there's little point in taking this change without bug 1062966, which I don't think has an owner.

If there is a strong reason for taking this change in 34 specifically, please ping me to discuss.
The plan was to be aggressive and get this into 34, but that just wasn't possible. We'll get this and bug 1062966 for Firefox 35.
