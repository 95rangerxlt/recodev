Several extensions add sub-menus to the context menu.  In previous builds, the
sub-menu would pop open on mouseover.  On 20040730, a left-click is now required
to open the extenson's sub-menu.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension that uses a context menu (for example, MakeLink
http://www.netsoc.ucd.ie/~finuvir/makelink_1.2.xpi ) and restart Firefox.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and mouse over the context menu item "Make
Link >"


Actual Results:  
The context menu did not open, and a left-click was required to open it.

Expected Results:  
The context menu should open automatically on mouseover.

I saw this bug with three of the extensions I use (Make Link, Linky, and
BBCode).  Another user in the forums verified the bug with two other extensions
(ReloadEvery and ImageZoom).  Looking through yesterday's checkins, I thought it
might be associated with either Bug 243720 [bookmark can't move into sub-folder
in personal toolbar (drag and drop)] or Bug 203183 [Bookmarks context menu stays
when clicking other menus].

confirmed for latest FF branch build (Gecko/20040730 Firefox/0.9.1+)
This broke recently. Blake, can you look at this?
It's not just extensions. Firefox has sub-menus on the context menu for frames
and iframes. 
Vlad, could this be your changes at bug 203183

Oops, need more coffee. Meant to reassign, not dupe. 
Uggh, I know why this is happening -- the menu open timer is just checking
whether any popup is open and refusing to open, it's not checking whether it's
about to open a submenu of the popup itself.  Will fix ASAP.
