I installed today's nightly trunk build for windows installer.  When I launch 
Deer Park then the locationbar is blank.  I then click a bookmark.  The 
bookmark does take me to the correct url, however, the url never appears in 
the locationbar.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
blank locationbar

Expected Results:  
I expect to see the url printed for the url that I am currently viewing.

Im pretty sure this is due to the checkins for bug 305767. There were some
follow up patches that didnt make the nightly so hopefully the next build will
be fixed.

Could this also effect the option "ctrl+l", or from the file menu "open 
location"?  I don't think that has worked in the last few nightly trunk images.
This issue still shows with the newer build. Copying in those involved in the
other bug.
Is there anything useful in the JS console? In particular, are there XML or CSS
parsing errors of chrome files?
Should have looked there sooner really:

Error: Expected declaration but found '#ifdef'.  Skipped to next declaration.
Source File: chrome://global/content/xul.css
Line: 869

Error: this.inputField has no properties
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/textbox.xml
Line: 0

I'm only seeing the this.InputField error in Comment 5.  Here is an additional
one I'm seeing:

Error: this.inputField has no properties
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/textbox.xml
Line: 84
And this one:

Error: event.target.rel has no properties
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbrowser.xml
Line: 757

Also sad to notice that my extension External Application Buttons is
non-functional. When I click one of the buttons I see an alert: 

"Type-Error: this.inputField has no properties"

xul.css fixup

Argh... I don't know how I missed xul.css in this.
fixed on trunk

For those wanting to fix this manually, it consists of going into
%browserdir%/Chrome/toolkit.jar and editing the xul.css within searching for the
c-style preprocessor blocks and deleting all the OSX and non-firefox sections as
well as the preprocessor directives themselves.

locationbar is always empty.  Can only use bookmarks and not type in a destination.
