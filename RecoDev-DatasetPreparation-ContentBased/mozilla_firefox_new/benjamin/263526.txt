I am using the brouser and have the profile in my documents and setings folder
but there is no default folder
and I did find a copy of the userChrome-example.css file in Firefox 1.0PR.zip
from
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/download.html?http%3A//ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.10/Firefox%201.0PR.zip
but not in Firefox Setup 1.0PR.exe from http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/
in
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.10.1/Firefox%20Setup%201.0PR.exe
