Firefox + XULRunner has some issues on Windows. I'm going to ignore inspector for the moment, but we shouldn't be building the embedding stuff in the browser half of the build, and morkreader linkage is sucky.

Fix morkreader linkage, don't build embedding gunk, rev. 1

morkreader_s is linked into libxul (for autocomplete import) as well as non-libxul (places import)... I had to build two versions of it.

Darin's out of town, this should be simple. The morkreader/external code can go away again when bug 321219 is fixed.

I don't like the "extenal" thing, but it's fine as a temporary workaround.  r=mento.
Fixed on trunk.
