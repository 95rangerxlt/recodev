Clear out installed-chrome.txt during installation.

Now that we do not use installed-chrome.txt for any of our built-in packages, we
probably want to go one-step further and wipe out anything else that may exist
in installed-chrome.txt after upgrading a user from firefox 1.0 to 1.1.  It's
possible that a user may have installed something using a traditional XPI (those
that use install.js) or they may have other cruft in installed-chrome.txt. 
We'll want to try to avoid problems that such chrome packages might cause when
run under Firefox 1.1.  Doing this should help minimize chances that people
report broken chrome problems that cannot be fixed by loading Firefox in safe mode.
