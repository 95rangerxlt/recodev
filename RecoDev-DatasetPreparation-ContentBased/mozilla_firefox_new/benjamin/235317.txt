every build has 
"<key id="key_inspectPage" key="&inspectorTaskCmd.commandkey;"
modifiers="accel,shift" command="Tasks:InspectPage"/>"
in red at the bottom where status bar is.
and it's REALLY big.

i've heard that it also happend on some linux builds.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.compile it

the version shown by the picture was a checkout from 2/28/2004 with:
--disable-composer --disable-debug --disable-ldap --disable-mailnews
--disable-tests --enable-crypto --enable-optimize=-O3 --disable-installer
--disable-profilesharing --disable-activex --disable-activex-scripting
--disable-gle --disable-dtd-debug

but also occurs with fewer options.
it does not happen with current mozilla!

g.fisher: to fix the issue in your tree, just remove the dist/bin/chrome
directory and build again.

Here is the problem...
1) the jar packaging system only check the modified time of the resource files.
As a consequence, the macro changes won't be picked up.
2) firefox build was picking up a seamonkey contents.rdf file for the locale and
a firefox contents.rdf file for the content in which 1.7b was hardcoded. Because
of 1) the locale contents.rdf was still 1.7a...

I sync'd the contents.rdf files in firefox, but I think it would be nice to have
a proper solution.

Shouldn't the jar packager always force the update for the resource files that
are flagged as '*' (sent to the preprocessor) in the jar.mn manifests?
The problem also exists for the #include directive, the files that contain this
macro are not automatically updated if the included files are changed.

updating summary.

diff -u12w make preprocessor always override

Patch... make-jars.pl will always do an override when preprocessing (will not
check for file timestamps).  There's a lot of whitespace cleanup I did on the
file as well, but this is a -w patch for reviewing.

sweet!
Now, we can remove the '*+' prefix in jar.mn files.

not a good day... I missed to check in this file.
fixed
so this fix seemed to have caused some major regressions in thunderbird. 

With this change, files that thunderbird forked no longer replace their mozilla
mailnews equivalents. I look at the jar file that gets generated (i.e
mailWindowOverlay.xul) and I see the mozilla mailnews versino of that file. the
version in mail\base\content is no longer overriding it. 

re-opening. pch, can we get this backed out until we figure out why it doesn't
work? You can't use a thunderbird build made with this patch in it right now, so
it's pretty bad...

yeah!! you did it!
thanks a lot.

better support than from many companies getting paid for this ;-))
for the record, the patch for the regression mscott noticed is in bug 236156,
r=mscott. 
marking fixed, hopefully for real.


jar packager doesn't update files with #expand or #include directives
