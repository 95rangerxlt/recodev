crash on startup

I'm running the latest trunk (after software update), and I crash on startup.

I think my Firefox 3.0a6pre: 2007061206 - Windows NT, but I can't tell for sure as I crash on startup.

More details coming

Seth, can you try removing xpcom_core.dll from your appdir?
also confirmed on Vista , see Bug 384172 comment #2
robert and I tried this:

install yesterday's trunk, 20070611, and then software update to 20070612, then
we crash.

We think it is this dll is the cause:  components/xpinstal.dll

Note, there are other files that might be left behind:

./components/jar50.dll
./components/jsd3250.dll
./components/xpinstal.dll
./xpcom_core.dll

also, the talkback extension was around:

./extensions/talkback@mozilla.org/components/master.ini
./extensions/talkback@mozilla.org/components/qfaservices.dll

but I think I remember bsmedberg saying if both breakpad and talkback were
around, that's ok.
I can trace the Windows Vista crash back to talkback, oddly enough: when I remove talkback the build starts normally.

Remove some files, rev. 1
Note, I'm on Windows XP.

From our tests:

Once you get the crash on startup issue, if you remove ./xpcom_core.dll and also xpti.dat and compreg.dat (from your profile) then you can start up (without removing xpinstal.dll).

And, if you put back the removed xpti.dat and compreg.dat (from your profile), even without xpcom_core.dll, you'll crash.

We've double checked this.
from comment #3:

> We think it is this dll is the cause:  components/xpinstal.dll

Please ignore that wild goose.

Thanks for the quick fix, bsmedberg!

Should we take down the existing mar?
I think we should just check this in and re-clobber.
Checked in a clobbered.
btw: I'm also seeing xpistub.dll in the appdir.
