Does it mean, that this note is obsolete?

no I didn't, I just put it in an SGML comment... look up and to the right ;)
Sorry my fault, I was somehow irritated by the diff output.
bsmedberg: please could you change the license blocks to have the correct SGML
comment style throughout - specifically, using the boilerplate from
http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/boilerplate-1.1/? Having something different (e.g. a
# prefix instead of a -) breaks my automated license parsing tools.

If you are using a # prefix in order to get the preprocessor to remove these
lines and cut down on size, then please consider using the BEGIN LICENSE BLOCK
and END LICENSE BLOCK headers to recognise and trim the license instead - that's
what they are there for :-) Moreover, you can keep licensing information in the
file by retaining the "Version:" line.

So a full license block can be collapsed easily and automatically to:
<!-- ***** BEGIN LICENSE BLOCK *****
   - Version: MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1
   - ***** END LICENSE BLOCK ***** -->

As I suggested recently in l10n newsgroup, I think it would be a good idea to
"standarize" a way so localization notes are associated to the proper key(s).
I'll paste the relevant part:

"I suggest something like a .remark suffix to the key, in the same way as
.accesskey, for instance, that can be associated to the key. And I'm not sure,
but not including these keys in the resulting localized file, shouldn't break
anything.

Also, but this is minor, the starting comment in most (all?) of the files
containing the license. Maybe a kind of "standarized" hidden style (like
starting the key with "_" or another convention) so for instance, the _license
key contains the license applied to the file."

In fact, i think it should be implemented a general system so developers can
include notes in a way that localizers can see them with MT or other high-level
translation tool.
gerv, I don't have time to make a more complicated patch, but I welcome patches 
from you or from other localizers.

Any alternative needs to
1) not include the entire license in the output file
2) work with MT (SGML parser) in source form
3) work with the preprocessor for build automation

Oscar, we do have a standard for comments, it's the standard SGML comment 
syntax <!-- -->, and Henrik and others have discussed the possibility of 
getting MT6 to display these comments in the MT UI.

Well, I don't know at this time Henryk's opinion, and I might be wrong, but I'm
afraid that doesn't cover my suggestion, since it seems that syntax cannot be
associated to a specific entry, as for instance accesskeys are. The target is to
not unlink useful developer notes for localizers, which actually are unlinked
and lost.

Fixed on the branch.
I am about to check in the de-DE locale and thought, wow, you gotta fix this one,
too, probably. Then I found out that our localisations in CVS don't have license
plates at all, is that a good thing?
No, but it was the fastest way for me to begin with the translation. Now that
the files in CVS are wellformed I'll update my Languagepack to include the
licence and other comments.
You'd better :-) Stripping off licenses from derivative works is never a good
thing, no matter how "helpful" it may be.

gerv: Mozilla Translator removes all the comments from en-US files
(it builds totally new ab-CD files).  However, MT allows translators 
to add a global license string.

Would you like to see license plates in ab-CD files?
Jeferson: that's probably not legal, strictly. The people listed as Contributors
in the original licensing comments need to have their attribution preserved in
derivative works (which translated files are.)

The right thing would be to fix MT to leave the license block alone.

DTD files are using .properties comment style and break localization tools
