Having translated about:mozilla and about:buildconfig pages requires from us
(localizers) to "hack" toolkit.jar and change mozilla.xhtml and buildconfig.html
in \global. Now, when the whole build process of localized official releases is
covered by mozilla.org, we can't do this modification. Besides, even draft of
trademark policy doesn't allow us to do so.  The easiest way to solve the
problem and (by the way) to make L10n teams life easier is to let us translate
contents of those abouts via .dtd or .properties files, just like in
about:plugins case....

Does firefox use /xpfe/global/resources/content/plugins.html?
Ah ignore the comment above, that got in there accidentally. Sorry for the bugspam.
Right now buildconfig is an HTML file, which path is hardcoded in
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/netwerk/protocol/about/src/nsAboutRedirector.cpp#73

So I'm happy to create a patch for about:mozilla (it's mostly done in my tree),
but about:buildconfig isn't going to happen (besides, if you're geeky enough to
read about:buildconfig, you're gonna have to know the English word for
"compiler" anyway).
Created attachment 157546
add mozilla.dtd

This has some extraneous changes from bug 257592 in jar.mn, please ignore them.

add mozilla.dtd

<bsmedberg> oops, really?
<bsmedberg> that was stupid
Created attachment 157565
fix the oops

Let's try this again, same proviso about jar.mn containing bits of bug 257592
Comment on attachment 157565
fix the oops

there we go, although translating an Easter Egg is silly, IMO ;)
Fixed on branch, not yet applicable to trunk. (Got a=ben over IRC)

a=asa for branch checkin.
Two more issues

a) The title tag of about:mozilla still uses english text. IMHO there should be
used &mozilla.from; insted.

b) The original reporter asked also for about:buildconfig. Since it's  a
different  story (see comment #3) I created bug 261911. 



about:mozilla should be localizable through .dtd file
