No error installing 1.8b4_2005090417 in German on WinXP. 
Same issue on Win98SE with 2005090417 de build. I copied the de.xpi out of the
windows temp folder while installer was running. Extracting the files with 7zip
and installing them manually, I got a working german installation, but without
any registry keys because of the early stop of the installer.
Trying to install the de.xpi into an en-US build as an extension gave
"unexpected error 1010" again. Manual install of the files changed language
properly.
Thats an error of the install script of the delonicera@walla.com.xpi file.

Exactly the same problem with Polish (pl) 1.8 branch builds...
...but the same build (Sept. 08, pl 1.8 branch build) installs OK under Windows
2000 Server.

As MMx suggested on IRC, this may be specific to non-NT Windows.
when did this regress?
Here's my install_wizard.log on winME, maybe this can help us to find out what's
wrong.

The (succesfull) install log of en-US.xpi

> ** is_winnt value: true <- is this wrong?

Looks wrong to me. :)

>      ** Folder StartMenuPrograms: null
>      ** Folder StartMenu        : null

Probably the reason for failing to install the shortcuts (and may be caused by
the winnt check earlier), however, that is not why it dies, I don't think.

>      ** szCurrentMozillaVersion: null
>      ** szCurrentMozillaVersion: null

I don't know if these represent the currently-installed version, or about to be
installed version (if the latter, they are very bad).

>      [41/117]	Create Registry Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla
> Firefox\\Main []

This is the fatal point - it is missing the key name between the "Mozilla
Firefox" and "Main" keys. My Registry has two keys at this point, "1.0.6
(en-US)" and "1.4 (en-US)", so I'd guess that you should be seeing something
like "1.4 (zh-TW)" at this point.

Localized langpack install log on Windows ME

The previous log attached in comment is too long... sorry,
Please use this one instead.
After being compared to en-US (succesful) install_wizard.log (see attachment):

 ** fFolderPrograms         : null 
  (in en-US this was C:\WINDOWS\Start Menu\Programs\Mozilla Firefox)
 That's why shortcuts were not created (** ERROR (-202): Windows Shortcut:
\Mozilla Firefox)

 ** szCurrentMozillaVersion: null
 That's because previous install log was made on a ME without any Mozilla product
 installed. And after succesfully installed en-US, the value changed to 1.7.5 even
 on a localized installer, so it's OK.

 ** [41/112]	Create Registry Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla
Firefox\\Main []
 This should be the root cause. Localized names did not appear in registry names.
->axel
I suspect that this is a fall out from bug 297813, but I have no idea
why localized installers wouldn't have a $UserAgent$ defined.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/installer/windows/ab-CD.jst#39
looks like the sweet spot, Benjamin, any idea?

(Not sure if I can really take this, but I'll see how far I can go.)
From the limited testing and investigating that I can do from here, it looks
like en-US calls into makeall.pl to set the UserAgent, but locales do not.
Looking at
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Mozilla1.8/1127507460.18967.gz&fulltext=1
makeall is called from deliver.pl, neither is called on 
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Mozilla1.8-l10n-pl/1127488620.30823.gz&fulltext=1
(pl windows 1.5 release repackaging)
deliver.pl is only called from build_static.pl, it seems, asking lxr and
restricting this to toolkit results.

Sorry, back to nobody, maybe Chase can pick this up, or we have to wait for
Benjamin. I don't know how to reliably reverse engineer this further.

Set the useragent in parseandmakejs.pl

This is untested, but should do it. I'll do a set of windows builds tomorrow to
verify that it works as I think it should.
Comment on attachment 197344
Set the useragent in parseandmakejs.pl

I really wonder if this stuff should be refactored, but that should surely be
done on the trunk, not on branches.
Fixed on trunk.
Fixed on 1.8 branch


Installer gives error 1010 in 1.8 branch localized nightly
