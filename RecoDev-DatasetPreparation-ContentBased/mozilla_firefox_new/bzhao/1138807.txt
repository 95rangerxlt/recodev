In nsWindowsShellService::SetDefaultBrowser, the comment below |rv = LaunchHTTPHandlerPane();| says "The above call should never really fail, but just in case fallback to showing control panel for all defaults".

However, the returned value of LaunchHTTPHandlerPane will be NS_ERROR_FAILURE if user cancels the http handler pane, either by pressing ESC or clicking outside the pane. This will bring up a control panel, which is kinda weird.
