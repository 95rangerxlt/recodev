reporter, is this dupe of bug 241148?
I installed a new version of Macromedia flash and the problem with this site seems to have gone away. I 
also tried the latest nightly and the probem does not happen there either.
Based on the information from the reporter, I am marking this bug as FIXED.


This site keeps refreshing itself and will not stop doing so.
