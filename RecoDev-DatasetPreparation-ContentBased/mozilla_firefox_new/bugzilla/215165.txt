I am not sure what causes this, but I am noticing that many (not all) external
links are creating new windows with the location bar "blocked."  I can see that
there is information there, but not anything useful.  It simply says
"undefined."  There does not seem to be any way to see the actual url.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click link from email - entourage or Thunderbird
2.see undefined in location bar
3.repeat

Actual Results:  
same as described above

Expected Results:  
It would be nice to see the actual URL

reporter, is firebird open, closed, or either when this happens?
When it is open.  I actually get another funky error from Thunderbird if I click
there if it is not open as Moz seems to think it should try in Thunderbird first.  

In Mozilla 1.5b I am not having any issues...
sounds like this might related to or same as bug 206936.  reporter, is the theme
for this new window messed up as well?
Indeed the theme is messed up.  It changes from the default Firebird theme to
the classic Mozilla theme...
I assume this is fixed now? It's working for me now that the external links bug
is fixed and I can test it out. 20031027 Firebird/0.7+
fixed in 0.7.1


external links blocking correct address in location, instead leaving undefined
