Hi, this may not be Mozilla and/or the Firefox developers fault but every time I
try to read the columnist articles at securityfocus.com, Firefox core dumps. 
http://www.securityfocus.com loads fine but when I try to visit
http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/272 (Security, 1994-2004: Then And Now)
Firefox just quits/crashes.  This has been happening for a while and I decided
to upgrade Firefox today thinking that might fix the problem but it hasn't.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox
2.Visit http://www.securityfocus.com
3.Click on either of the links under the "Columnists" section, e.g.;
http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/272

Actual Results:  
Firefox quits and/or crashes

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed the requested url

I've saved firefox-bin.core file after the last crash.  I'll attach it after I
submit this.

I just tried several times to attach my firefox-bin.core file but when I click
the submit button it just hangs attempting to contact bugzilla.mozilla.org  If
you need this file let me know and I can email it to you.

I have followed your instructions, and got no crash.

However, your report looks significant of something.

I may have misunderstood your last comment, but I would suggest that a core
file is probably several hundred MB in size, and would not make a good 
attachment to a bug report. Is it possible for you to open the core file
with gdb and provide a backtrace?
Sorry for not commenting on this earlier but since upgrading to the most current
release of Firefox I haven't had any problems.

So far, visiting SecurityFocus or any other URL produces no crashes.  8^)

Thanks
