this hobby page just switched to new pullout menu system ... it 
works ok until you scroll right side to bottom.  then some of
the pullouts are displayed with blacked out areas... 
this does not occur in netscape 7.1 or recent mozilla browser
only in firebird!!   son of a gun! 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. access http://www.atlasrr.com
2. scroll to bottom of front page
3. display pullouts on left sidebar menu. 

Actual Results:  
some pullouts (secondary menus) contain black areas
in their area

Expected Results:  
display menus correctly ala mozilla and netscape 7.1

bug has been repaired prior to Dec 03, 2003 release!
original reporter used nov 16 nightly instead of grabbing 
new nightly first !! 
his problem was that mozilla.org's new site is not friendly
for nightlys or for firebird...

found texurizer.net site from the firebird toolbar and now
promise to stay up to date before sending bugs abt firebird
