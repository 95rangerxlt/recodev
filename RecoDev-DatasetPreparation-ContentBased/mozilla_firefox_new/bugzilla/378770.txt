Filed as a result of discussion and review comments on bug 377076, this bug tracks the need for a patch on the new page info page which fixes some visual problems, specifically:

 - Use groupboxes instead of groove separators, to bring it into consistency with the rest of page info
 - Fix style bugs (especially on windows platform).  Michael Ventor has posted a patch on the original bug that I will move here.
 - Clean up the view certificate button, which presents differently than the other buttons on the page.

Windows follow-ups from 377076

- Makes dialog readable on Windows
- Fixes oversight where readonly attributes weren't on new textfields
- Improves i18n of view count
One other suggestion:

"Have I visited this website before today?" just doesn't sound right IMO. A much clearer way to put it is "Have I visited this website prior to today?"

First patch for cleanup

Subsumes Ventnor's patch and includes the change to groupboxes and the re-org of the view cert button.  

Michael, before I flag this patch for review, can you have a look and see how it behaves in windows, and whether I broke anything from your patch?
Everything looks fine here.

Bam!

First patch for cleanup

Reviewer note: a lot of the delta in pageInfo.xul is just indenting because of the groupbox wrapping.  Sorry about that.  :(

First patch for cleanup

-<!ENTITY  securityView.label    "View">
+<!ENTITY  securityView.label    "View Certificate">

rev the entity name, else localizers are not notified on this change.

Please also remove all these trailing spaces from the xul file (in places you're patching).

r=mano otherwise.

There are still some trailing spaces in the xul file:

>+          <button id="security-view-cert" label="&securityView.certView;"
>+                  accesskey="&securityView.accesskey;"
>+                  oncommand="security.viewCert();"/>          

>+        <caption id="security-privacy" label="&securityView.privacy.header;" />
>+        <grid>
>+          <columns>
