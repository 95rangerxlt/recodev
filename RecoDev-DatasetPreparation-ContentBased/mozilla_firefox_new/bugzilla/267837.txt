I have un-installed the 1.0 PR, without removing the Firefox directory, so I can
keep my bookmarks and settings, and when I installed RC2, none of the toolbar
buttons work except for the Home button. Back and Forward are disabled.

My bookmarks are all gone too! The bookmark menu bar under the toolbar is blank!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall Firefox 1.0PR
2. Don't Remove the Firefox Directory
3. Install Firefox 1.0RC1 or RC2

Actual Results:  
Toolbars and Bookmarks are broken and cannot be used.

Expected Results:  
Make it transferable in 1.0 Final, please!
