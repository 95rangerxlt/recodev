If you consider a webpage with the following:

<textarea name="message" rows="15" cols="35" tabindex="3">blah blah blah</textarea>

You can't select the text in the textarea with the mouse - you have to use the
keyboard.

Remove the 'tabindex="3"' and it begins to work.

This style of textbox is used on phpBB bulletin boards. Nightly builds broke
this a few weeks ago.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a blank web page
2. Use this as the html <textarea name="message" rows="15" cols="35"
tabindex="3">blah blah blah</textarea>

Actual Results:  
You can't select the text with your browser

Reporter: can you reproduce with this testcase?  If not, can you attach a
testcase where you can reproduce?

Also note bug 251500 for Camino, but that doesn't seem reproducible either.
Yes, your testcase reproduces it.

If you remove tabindex="3" I am able to select the text.

I've just attempted a complete uninstall. Deleted my profile folder and
completely deleted the Mozilla directory. Reinstalled with the latest nightly
installer, and the problem remains.

The description in bug 251500 for Camino does describe my problem, but I don't
see any fix.
I just tested the 2004-06-12-09-trunk and the problem went away.

Reinstalled the latest nightly, the problem came back.
