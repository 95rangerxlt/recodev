Currently there is no way how can ordinary user pin tabs. The best approach is to add "Pin tab" into tab's contextual menu.

Ugh, the original title just made my head hurt.
Sorry, my English isn't perfect. :)
will likely want the string to reference app tabs instead of pinning.

Add context menu items

Is it naive to imagine something this simple might do the job? It's what I've been using locally.

It uses "Convert to App Tab" and "Convert to Normal Tab" - I can readily believe we have better strings to use than those. I'd love to either get some strings quickly, or push "good strings" out to a follow up bug, though -- I'd like to get people using the feature and they need a UI to do so.

"Make into App Tab"/"Make into Normal Tab"

Beltzner gave ui-r for "Make into App Tab", "Make into Normal Tab" with the caveat that we file a blocking follow up to wordsmith. I'll file that momentarily.

Filed bug 577004 on the wordsmithy.
When changing to an App tab or reverting to a Normal tab the tabstrip moves up or down depending on what you are changing too.  IMO it would be a cleaner look if nothing 'moved' at all.  More polished as they say.

Also the favicons on the tabs (App/Normal) don't line up.  The App tab is a pixel or two above the Navigation bar (by design?).  Changing all tabs to App tabs causes strange results depending whether using small or large icons.  Using large ones the tabs and the Nav bar run together.  Small icons causes the Nav bar to disappear.
Gary - thanks for the comments, but these are probably more likely to get fixed as followup bugs - one bug per issue is typically the quickest way to get developer attention on things. Can you file those?
I've found more oddities.  Can I just make them all one bug report?
Closely related things, like multiple small layout issues, can typically be combined since the fix will likely be in the same place for all of them. But functional bustage or misbehaviour should probably be kept separate, since the solution for each one of those might be independent. Does that make sense?
I'm finding so many quirks depending on so many factors like small versus large icons, menu bar shown/hidden.  Drawn titlebar/Windows Titlebar.  If you have an icon on the tabstrip or not.  An add-on of mine doesn't quite work as it should. 

I'll see what I can do but I'm surprised you haven't come across these.
Sorry I'm still posting here but to be honest I am finding so many things screwed up I would be filing bugs on it till the cows come home.  The latest thing is when I restart Fx I get an empty tab instead of the page I left off at.
Resetting my toolbars resolved many of my problems.
Jonthat: sorry about the lag with the ui-review on 7/5, for spin off bugs note that Limi is driving this feature from the UX side.

No sweat - I'll go ask him in the other bug what text he would like. :)
I would like to ask, is it intended that after restarting(normal close FF and open FF) Firefox with a app tab, the app tab change back into a normal tab?

Nope! But that's bug 575560
There are Litmus test cases for pinning and unpinning an app tab - https://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=12094 and https://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=12767. Setting in-litmus+
