When the window manager requests the last Firebird window closed (typically by
clicking the close box, close on a WM context menu, or Alt-F4) Firebird will not
close until you click on a button or link.  It exhibits proper response to the
window close requests when multiple windows are open, until the last window is open.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird
2. Attempt to close by the window manager
3. Get nothing
4. Click on link or button
5. Firebird closes

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens until you click on a link or button.

Expected Results:  
Firebird should have closed when the window manager requested it.

I noticed this starting about 8/10/03, and continues to the current nightly
builds as of 8/28/03.  I have tried the current nightly build (8/28/03), and it
still exhibits this behavior.

X Windows is XFree86 4.3, KDE 3.2, and was working on this configuration
previously.  No other applications exhibit this type of behavior.
Works for me using Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5)
Gecko/20031003 Firebird/0.7

This is using KDE 3.1.3 on SuSE 8.2

Can you replicate this with a current nightly/0.7 RC?
Can no longer replicate... seems to have gotten fixed.


Firebird will not quit immediatley if the window manager requests the last window closed
