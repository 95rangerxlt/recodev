Steps to reproduce:
1. Open view-source window
2. Hit the Esc key

Actual results:
View-source window closed

Expected results:
Nothing should happen, because view-source is a window, not a dialog. Closing
windows with Esc is non-standard on Windows.

This is particularly annoying when using find-as-you-type, because Esc is used
to cancel a search:
1. Open view-source window
2. Search for the text "foo" by typing "/foo"
3. Now you change your mind, you want to search for bar instead, so you hit Esc.

Expected result:
Your search should be cancelled and nothing else.

Expected result:
The view-source window is closed.

I am using Firefox 0.8 for Windows.

Trivial patch to Firefox

I don't think this bug applies to the Suite.
Shouldnt the product be set to Firefox?

IE doesn't behave this way, so I assume this should get fixed in firewhatever.

I like being able to close View Source with Esc.  The real problem is bug
233155, FAYT not eating the Esc.
When Firefox supports reloading of the page in View Source as Mozilla 1.7a does
(Firefox doesn't yet support this, right?), I think Esc should be used to stop
the load like it does in a regular browser window.
Ben fixed this today.
It checked that bug had fixed.
