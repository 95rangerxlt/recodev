Please do NOT dupe this bug to 246616 without either.
A.  Checking in t the fix or
B.  Adding "needed-aviary1.0" to the status whiteboard for bug 246616.

(sorry for bugspam,  just thought something was needed to document the need for
a fix for this or it would just get lost and not make the release).
confirming.
If NT is supported, then this is a smoketest blocker.
fix at bug 246616?
Taking away blocking-aviary requests, since this is a smoketest blocker.
re comment #4.  It is not really clear to me that the final fix for the issue is
actually completely contianed in the patches attached to bug 246616.  Neil
checked in a fix with no bug number that is what fixed it so the turnk builds
now work corrrectly with windows NT.  He did post a commnet to bug 246616 saying
he fixed it but the checked in code looks different than the patches that are
attached to the bug.  I think what is required is to make this area of
nsIconChannel.cpp on the Aviary branch be the same a s the current trunk code.

Adding Neil to the cc list to see if he can lend help to fixing this.

Asa, could you take a look at bug 249593 and bug 248509 ? They may be smoketest
blockers too. They only happen on a subset of NT setups, the ones without IE
installed or without the latest service packs, but still are blockers for some
people (see bug 248479 for instance). Thank you.
