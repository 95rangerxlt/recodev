Thanks for filing this bug and writing patches! The bug itself and the patches could really use some descriptions of failure cases and how you are fixing those. That makes reviewing changes much easier.

tab.lastAccessed is already initialized with zero. Just adding a tab doesn't mean it was accessed.

It would be great if you could elaborate *what* you are fixing here and *why* you are fixing it this way.

Why would we want to return Infinity for the selected tab?

Removing this means that for selected tabs we wouldn't return the current time.

Bug 445461 comment 11:
Currently, the lastAccessed stamp is not set on a never accessed new background tab, which will have lastAccessed = 0 stored. This does not match how ctrlTab handles a new tab. 

Ctrl-Tab should be able to switch to the newly added tab immediately.
See: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-tabPreviews.js#482
I don't know much about Ctrl-Tab and its desired behavior. Dão, can you please take a look at the issue raised in comment #6?

Seems problematic in preview mode. We may set the time stamp on selected tab to Infinity.

Return Date.now() for "selected" tab is wrong in preview mode. The "selected" state could be temporarily set by ctrlTab.

That could be fixed quite easily by doing something like:

  <getter>
    return this.selected && !this.parentNode.tabContainer.tabbrowser._previewMode ? Date.now() : this._lastAccessed;
  </getter>
By this way, you'll get wrong value for the truly selected tab. You even don't know which one is the truly selected tab in preview mode.
Setting lastAccessed to Infinity is in fact identifying the tab as the truly selected one. If you really desire a Date.now(), Infinity could be converted to Date.now() in the getter. In my opinion, Infinity could serve the same purpose as Date.now() here.
I find a 3rd issue. The tab.lastAccessed field will be re-initialized to 0 after a tab is moved.

Patch v2

The patch is to address 3 issues.
1/ tab.lastAccessed is re-initialized to 0 after one tab is moved
2/ tab.lastAccessed is not set for a new tab
3/ tab.lastAccessed may return wrong value in preview mode

Use lastAccessed rather than _lastAccessed, and don't unnecessarily move the oldTab line.

This restriction doesn't seem useful, so please drop this change.

Oh, and browser/base/content/test/general/browser_lastAccessedTab.js will need to be updated.
