5. same as 4., but webpage continues loading for minutes, content and some

WFM

The same happens to me with the lates 0.9.1 nightly build.
I have the problem on PHP pages and it only happens sometimes... usually by
clicking again on the link the page opens fine.
I'm on WinXP Pro with P4 3.2
SOLUTION!!!

Okay, after trying several nightly builds and latest trunks I found out, that
the Problem is not caused by Firefox itself, but by AllInOneGestures 0.11.1!
Every other extension does not have any effects!


tries to download main.asp (server script)
