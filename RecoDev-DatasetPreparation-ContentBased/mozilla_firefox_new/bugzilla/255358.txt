When I enter the above web site, occasionally Mozilla hangs and never returns.
In task manager I see it does not respond and consumes all CPU cycles.
The probability that this occurs increases significantly with the number of
other web sites I have visited. After let's say 4 or 5 other web sites, I nearly
get a 100% lock up.

There is also a safe way to get a hang on this site. After entering via the
above URL, visit the first thread with the link
http://www.wallstreet-online.de/si/community/board/threadpages.php?&woid=00019277&m=1.1.6.1.0&k=ADVANCED+MICRO+DEVICES+INC&cat=STK&tid=812310&fid=10&offset=0&woid=00019277&k=ADVANCED+MICRO+DEVICES+INC&page=-1
then (you need to be a registered user) click in "Antwort schreiben" (submit a
response) to create your own message in the thread. Out of 5 tries, I got 5
hangs regardless of the number of web pages visited before.

Note that the NT version I use is 4.0, 1381, Service Pack 6.
This has first occurred with FF 0.9, and continues to do so. It never occured in
previous versions.
I also use FF 0.9x on Windows 98 and XP and NEVER have any Problems with this page.
After some research I found similar bug reports but for other pages. I decided
to create a new bug since I am not sure if that this one is related.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF 0.9x
2. enter 
http://www.wallstreet-online.de/si/community/board/search.php?m=1.1.6.1&&woid=00019277&k=863186&cat=STK
3. click on thread "AMD - Auf dem Weg zum Intc-Crossover"

4. click "Antwort schreiben" (needs free registration before)

Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs. There is no repainting done for FF windows and FF consumes 100%
CPU time. Only way to stop it is via task manager.

Expected Results:  
No hang, page displayes properly :-)

@Peter
Thanks for the check. Unfortunately the nature of these freezes is that they can
be easily reproduced on a particular machine/configuration, but others usually
can't. Check for similar bug reports in Bugzilla. Nevertheless I believe it is a
FF problem which was introduced with 0.9. As I indicated the problem with this
site does not occur on W98 and XP (ok it also is a different machine). 

Is there a special version of FF which would allow to get more information as to
where it hangs in the app?
Just downloaded and installed FF 0.10.
No lockups, everything fine. For my part, this bug can be closed. Something must
have been done about it. Probably a side effect of other bug fixing.
