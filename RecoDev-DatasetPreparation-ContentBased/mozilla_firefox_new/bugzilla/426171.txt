Follows pretty much the same layout except more colourful. We can't use the standard toolbar icons like before since those are now dynamic on Linux.

We can't use the reload icon here like before for aforementioned reasons, plus because the "reloaded" pun was Firefox 2's. So we took the folded shirt metaphor that Linux now uses for themes.

Take a look at it and see if you can guess the inspiration for the style and colours. Ingenious, no? :-)

Also, reed, what's the process for image-only checkins? Just approval is necessary, IIRC?
While we don't need to completely follow http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/identity-guidelines/firefox.html, I do think we probably need the (R) for the word "Firefox"... gerv or David, could you let us know what this needs to have?
Copying Frank for his feedback.

Yes, it would be good practice to use the "R in circle" symbol for the word "Firefox", since it is in fact a registered trademark and we do this for other uses of the term (e.g., on the mozilla.com home page).


The only reason I didn't bother was because the Firefox 2 preview didn't have the (R).

Yep, that was a mistake. I've asked faaborg to make sure the new preview icons for Firefox 3 on all OSs include the (R).

This doesn't match the real logo... the (R) is the wrong color and is in the wrong spot.

I didn't know you were a ui-reviewer reed ;) Shall I ask you again? :P

Also, I need to know where the theme version and description is kept, I can't use MXR because the search takes so long that the server kills it before its finished, leaving me with nothing.

Minuses are always free. ;)

This doesn't look like the right gray, as compared to what http://www.mozilla.com/img/firefox-title.png is using. Looks like you need to use #545454 (RGB: 84, 84, 84).

Change that, and then request ui-r from faaborg, please. :)

Already handling this in bug 423177.

I fail to see why a ui-r from faaborg is necessary.
Has faaborg ui-reviewed these icons yet? As far as I know, he reviews all the icons the Tango team submits before they are attached to a bug for committing. If he hasn't, he needs to, as it's his call.

Right colour of the (R)

I really wonder who is going to notice a different hue on the (R) unless they're explicitly looking for it?

Style guidelines

>I fail to see why a ui-r from faaborg is necessary.

Because we are crazy OCD about our word mark, and I have access to detailed documents chock full of rules :)

The three things we need to get right are:
-Font is meta bold roman
-Color should be rgb(214, 66, 3) #D64203 
-(r) mark should be black, and needs to be aligned to the top of the x

Right colour of the (R)

I need to check on if we are allowed to use different colors for the word (for instance our new home page uses a darker red).  In the meantime, the aliasing on the text seems wrong, particularly on either side of the f.  Do you have the font or are you resizing an existing image?  I can send you the font if you need it.
Looking at the style guidelines I guess the (R) is supposed to match the word mozilla if it is present, and would be in #666666 or rgb(102,102,102)

Here are the guidelines in case anyone is curious:

Alex, we used an existing image. Sending me the font would be appreciated, just send it as an attachment to my bugmail.

faaborg, can you please also ui-r the icon.png? (And hurry? RC1 is getting close)

Looks fine, bonus points for using a tango style firefox logo on the blue shirt instead of a stripe :)

I'm at a loss, what was the inspiration?

I didn't do so because I thought the icon was going to change soon? (Plus, subtlety is what makes it more memorable :) )

What other graphic do you know of that uses those colours? :)
