This occurs on a site that requires a secured login.  Whenever the site opens a
popup, it is blocked.  I have allowed that site to have popups in the
preferences, but it still blocks it.  In fact, I can turn off the popup blocker
and the site is still blocked.  General pattern to reproduce is log into site,
open the first popup (Which usually works), close that popup, try to open a
different one.  The second popup always fails.  The only way to get it to work
is to close down Firefox and restart.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to website
2. Open first popup (Success)
3. Close the popup
4. Open a new popup (Fails)

Actual Results:  
Second popup and subsequent popups fail.

Expected Results:  
Allowed all popups from that site.

Well, OK. One user has this problem and it seems to be restricted to one secret
website. This isn't an interesting bug until it can be confirmed by more than
one user using at least one public website. Frankly I'm skeptical since I'd
expect such a problem to be widely reported, and it turns out most -- dare I say
all? -- people who do report similar bugs, it turns out, are reporting bugs in
their incompatible extensions. Leaving open for now.
Maybe troubles with TBE again?
This issue was caused by an extension called TAB Browser Extensions by Shimoda
Hiroshi.  Removing the extension solved the issue.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
