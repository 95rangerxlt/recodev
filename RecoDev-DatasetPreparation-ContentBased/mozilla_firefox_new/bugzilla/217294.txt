When clicking the Inbox link in the left frame of mail.com, Firebird sometimes
crashes.  Reading a mail message before clicking the link seems to increase the
odds that the crash appears, though I don't have hard numbers to confirm this.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to an account at mail.com.
2. Click Inbox, several times if necessary.  (It has taken as long as 10 minutes
to get it to crash.)
Actual Results:  
Firebird crashes.  (Sometimes.)

Expected Results:  
Firebird shouldn't crash.

Talkback ID: TB23062640E.  There should be at least two more talbacks (with my
e-mail address) from a 20030824 build, but I erased the IDs when I installed the
latest nightly.  Sorry.

This may be related to the "crashy-ness" described in bug 216436.

reporter: Can you please test with Firebird 0.7 release candidate builds. I am
unable to reproduce this under Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Redhat Linux 9. Did
you apply all Windows update patches

would like to close this bug as WFM (Works for me)
I think this disappeared a few weeks ago.  Sorry about leaving it open.
