the URL link opens an iMix at the iTMS using iTunes... is the page just sending
a request for the itms: protocal?

Does typing itms:// then pressing return crash fire fox as well?
no, itms:// doesn't crash firefox.  It just pops up the same dialog (which I did
miscopy in the initial post), but clicking ok does not lead to a crash.
Reporter, does this still occour on 0.9.1?
Does not cause crash on my mac. It warn about launching an external app
(iTunes). No page is displayed, but iTunes is correctly opened. However, the
warning window that drops down is clips the warning text at its right limits.
(That's with the 1.0PR, Mac OS X 10.3.5, and iTunes 4.7)
The URL never crashed Firefox for OS X... the issue was limited to Solaris. It
would be nice if Joshua would let us know if this still happens.

So... Joshua does
http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPublishedPlaylist?id=12162
still crash Firefox for you?
sorry for the delay.

This url does not crash on Solaris in the 1.0 Preview Release. 

I just get the dialog saying that itms is an registered protocol, but clicking
OK does not lead to a crash.  Thanks!


consistent crash at this apple url
