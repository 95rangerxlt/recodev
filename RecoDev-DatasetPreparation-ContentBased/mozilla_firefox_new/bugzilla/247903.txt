I start with firefox up and running. 

In pmmail, I get a message with a url. I select the URL. RMB  asks if I want to
explore the url . Then one more RMB and return in PMMAIL should send me into
firefox  which should open the url. That is the way it worked previously
including in firefox0.8. 

But in firefox 0.9, after hitting return in pmmail, I am taken to the firefox
"choose user profile" dialog. If I click to start I get the message that this
profile is already in use...

I actually fixed this.

The problem was that nsNativeAppSupportOS2.cpp was missing for firefox.


picking a url from pmmail puts me into profile manager instead of opening that url
