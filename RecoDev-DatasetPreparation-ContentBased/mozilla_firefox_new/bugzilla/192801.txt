Jack, did you check with the latest nightly build from
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/phoenix/nightly/latest-trunk/phoenix-win32.zip
installed in a new directory together with a fresh profile?

=> revised summary from confusing spelling errors
maybe the Tab bar extention is causing this
Sorry i forgot to add WFM

Reporter:

Can you tell us what tab-related preferences you've got set, and especially if
you have installed tabbed browsing extension?
I also see this in Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) 
Gecko/20021207 Phoenix/0.5.  However in order to make this bug happen I need
to do something first.  

When I 1st start phoenix this doesn't happen.  However, once I manually
type in or edit a url in the url history bar and type return
then every time I find a previous 
history item with a mouse click it will open a new tab.  This happens to me
constantly.

I did have TBE installed but I uninstalled it and I saw the same behavior.
Mail from Chris Walter:

"I just double checked with todays linux nightly and a new profile. I
get the same behavior. Here is how to reproduce the problem:

- open a new tab so that you have two tabs and focus on the second tab

- click on the URL history bar and choose something. The url should load in the
second tab. This is as expected

- go into the urlbar and manually type in a url and press enter. This url should
load in the 2nd tab also

- finally choose a new url with your mouse again. Now you will get a new tab
each time you do it. Once you manually edit the url bar everytime you choose a
new url with the mouse you will get a new tab"

I will check these steps with latest Windows nightly and see if I can reproduce it.
Tweaking summary and confirming with a Linux build.

Status --> New
This looks like the bug I was about to submit:

Steps to reproduce:
0. Make blank page your default home page.
1. Go to http://freshmeat.net by typing it URL bar and pressing ENTER.
2. Quit.
3. Restart MozillaFirebird.
4. Go to http://www.mozilla.org by typing it in URL bar and pressing ENTER.
5. Select http://freshmeat.net from URL bar

Actual results:
1. A new tab appears.
2. Briefly, you see http://www.http://freshmeat.net.org in URL bar
3. I end up at http://www.web1000search.com

Expected results:
1. No new tab.
2. Take me to http://freshmeat.net

Build: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030521 Mozilla
Firebird/0.6

No extensions installed.

It is somewhat of a privacy issue.  I wonder if the folks at
http://www.web1000search.com track their redirections.

I can reproduce this on a CVS build of Firebird on Linux. Does not happen with
SeaMonkey. Actually this was worse with 0.6: Upon selecting the URL (with the
mouse) it would open a new tab, but not load the URL! With current CVS, at least
it loads the URL (albeit in a new tab instead of the current one).

Noririty's patch to bug 177618 seems to fix this bug too:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177618#c27

Works for me,tested against cvs head as of Jul 13 2003.

Still happens with trunk build 20030726 (Linux, no extensions installed).

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open a new window.
2. Type in a URL (e.g. www.mozilla.org) and press enter to load the page.
3. Click the URL-bar drop-down and select another URL.

Result: The selected page opens in a new tab.

It seems like this bug is triggered by manually entering a URL. Only the window
where the URL was entered is affected.
I'm no longer seeing this on my 2003-09-08 build on WinXP with the steps given
in comment 6 and comment 14, but since I'm on windows and this bug has been
reported against linux that might be not surprising. But may I ask for retesting
here.
Yep, still seeing this

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030909 Firebird/0.6.1+

and this is with a relatively new ( <2 days) profile as well.
Please fix this, its so annoying...

I see this on Firebird 0.6.1 on NetBSD. The problem seems to be that the history
file is being rewritten. I'm deeply suspicious of JavaScript in advertising
banners, but I have no evidence of this apart from my history file. I'll attach
it when I get an obviously broken one.
Created attachment 135046
Good history file

This is my history file shortly after I had cleared it, but before it became
corrupted.
Created attachment 135047
This is my corrupted history file

In this particular case, typing in www.netbsd.org to the toolbar causes me to
go to www.paysforsurveys.com (who seem to be scam artists).

.
me too with the "paysforsurveys" thing.

linux-x86 debian unstable mozilla-firebird 0.6.1

i click on a link in my addressbar dropdown (any random one) and it either comes
up corrupted (to http://www.http.com//www.mylink.com/.org) or takes me to
paysforsurveys.

this is some evil crap.  I have javascript enabled but all checkboxes possible
unchecked under tools/javascript/advanced  

I will send you any files or info you need to make  this easier for you to fix.
just upgraded to 0.7, still seeing problem.

to replicate:
type addr in addr bar <enter> (I used http://www.apple.com)
go somewhere else from bookmarks
hit down arrow on address bar, select address you typed in before

boom.  a new tab opens about:blank after a few seconds, tries to load
http://www.http.com//www.apple.com/.org/

haven't yet seen the "paysforsurveys" yet, but I know it's coming... I can feel
it ;-)

A new tab opens if I select a web page from the url bar history.
