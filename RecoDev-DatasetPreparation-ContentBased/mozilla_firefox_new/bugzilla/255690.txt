Firefox .9.3 is unable to load from Microsoft Web Outlook at AIU Online
(https://mycampus.aiu-online.com).  Firefox does not hang, nothing loads, but
the 'load graphic' for Web Outlook is displayed.  The flash media and Java
plugins are installed.  Works with IE 6.0, but not Firefox.  OS is Windows XP
Professional SP1.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to AIU Online with student account.
2. Click the "email" lick to load Microsoft Web Outlook.
3. New Firefox window opens.

Actual Results:  
The new Firefox window looks as if it will load Web Outlook correctly, to
include the graphic that suggests it is receiving information from the server. 
Nothing ever happens past that point, and the graphic persists.

Expected Results:  
It should have loadated a page that appears to encapsulate MS Outlook, complete
with folders on the left frame, a listing of emails in the inbox in the center,
and an email displayed on the right frame.  Normal Outlook menus and buttons are
on the top.

Using default theme.  Basic build of XP Pro SP2.

I also have a problem loading Microsoft Outlook Web Access. It appears to load
three frames. The left most frame has the usual Outlook icons, but the next two
frames are empty. They usually contain the actual Inbox messages.
I installed the new 1.0 preview and the problem is fixed.  I can now access 
the MS Outlook Web Access without problems.


Firefox will not load Microsoft Web Outlook.
