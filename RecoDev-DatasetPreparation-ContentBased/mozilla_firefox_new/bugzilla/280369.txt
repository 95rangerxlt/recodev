Before anything is fetched or displayed, the program crashes. With the DEBUG env
set, an X malloc error message is shown.

It's similar to bug #40931. There is no lack om memory though, and all other
apps continue running fine after the crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter url
2.hit <enter>

Actual Results:  
kaboom

Expected Results:  
showed some text and pictures, i guess

#export DEBUG=1
#firefox
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 7849 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

With Firefox 1.01 the page is now displayed and it looks OK.
