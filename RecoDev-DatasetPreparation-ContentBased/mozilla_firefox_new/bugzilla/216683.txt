Build Identifier: Firebird 0.6.1

I'm trying to install 0.6.1 for the first time; I've got no further than, 
well, nothing happening at all when I try and run the exe.  I tried playing 
with the favorites folder.  And I ran it with the -p flag.  I have an Opera7 
installation and also tried removing that (which was partly successful.)  

Any ideas?

(PS.  When I unzipped MozillaFirebird-0.6.1-win32.zip I got some file 
overwrites (e.g., <several>.rdf, bookmark.html, ...).  Which struck me as odd. 
There are 310 items in the new folder.)

are your IE or Opera favorites unusully big?, firebird will try to import them...
also try deleting your profile if there is one..enter %APPDATA% into Run dialog
and see if there's a Phoenix or Firebird folder. Other than that, I'm stumped.
OK, it all worked fine when I used the Wininstaller to do the job.  I don't 
know if the problem was the Unzip, the non-default directory name I chose, or 
whatever.  Thanks for the quick reply.

PS  IE bookmarks imported fine.
