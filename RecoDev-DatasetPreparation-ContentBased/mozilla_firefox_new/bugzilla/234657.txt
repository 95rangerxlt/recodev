Could you please give a url where this sort of code is used (or build a simple
test case)? 

I would rather not have to wander all over the web to find an example of this.
testcase is needed, not an example URL
Created attachment 151480
Simple testcase.  Not sure if this is accurate to reporters bug

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614
Firefox/0.9

Adding testcase for others to try, but unable to duplicate this bug on 0.9

Reporter: is this testcase accurate or is this not what you are describing?

This looks good - I have not had the problem reoccur in 0.9. I believe some of
the extensions I had istalled may have been causing the problem.


Button with alert followed by form submit fails to submit the form
