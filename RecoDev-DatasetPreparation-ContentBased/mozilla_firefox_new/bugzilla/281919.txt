i have put a java script that allows the visitor to make this their homepage,
yet dragging and dropping the link (firefox actually changes the text of the
link, also), onto the home button puts the link into tools/options but with an
extra .com on the end of the url so the button doesn't work afterwards

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just drag and drop 
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
made url in tools/options with extra .com on the end

Expected Results:  
made the url the homepage correctly

dragging and dropping the 'make this your homepage'  link onto home button creates error
