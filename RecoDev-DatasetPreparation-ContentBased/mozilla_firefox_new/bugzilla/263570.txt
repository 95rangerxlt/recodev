Yes, but there are some other quirks. I suppose there's no problem if you set
your prefs to open new windows into new windows, is there? This is almost
certainly bug 263689, which I just got around to filing. That bug is caused when
a failure to open the URL aborts the tab creation process. In that bug, the
invalid URL is never successfully opened. It's interesting that in the case of
this bug, the Cyrillic file is successfully opened on its second attempt.

How are you opening the file? Open File Dialog? Double-click from desktop? Drag
and drop from desktop? Something else?
>I suppose there's no problem if you set your prefs to open new windows into new
windows, is there?
I experience the same problem even if I set everything to open links from Other
applications in New windows (everything else is default). So I assume it is
different (though probably related) from bug 263689.

Drag'n'drop and File>Open works correctly. Everything else doesn't - shortcut
from desktop, html file from explorer or from Total Commander. 

[When I tried to open an http://cyrillic.ru link from TB (I suspect this is not
supported, but still) - it resulted in a *very* strange link in the URL bar
(http://www.xn--b1agh1afp.ru/), and no second window was opened.]
Nickolay, does the machine you're using primarily use a Western character set
with Cyrillic fonts added? Or is it primarily a Cyrillic machine? Or does that
make any sense? I know very little about un-American machines :)

Darin, is it possible that all Cyrillic URLs fail their first attempt to load,
causing us to realize there's a problem and try again with a nsIURIFixup-ed
version of the URL, which succeeds? (If so, hopefully that's true only on
primarily Western machines.)
I have non-translated version of Windows (I believe this means "primarily
Western") installed but everything in Regional and Language options is set to
Russian. It has cyrillic keyboard layout, if that matters.
hmm... looking at:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=159445&action=view
+            ios->NewURI( urlStr, 0, 0, getter_AddRefs(uri) );

(which should maybe use NS_NewURI)

urlStr looks like it is probably not UTF-8 encoded. maybe this causes the
problem.  might be better to just nsEscape it before passing to the ioservice...

Perhaps I should have specified in my report that this was a new bug for me when
I upgraded to the recent Firefox 1.0.

This bug did NOT manifest for me with the prerelease when loading files from a
directory with the '²' (unicode 0x00B2) character.  With the recently released
Firefox 1.0, this bug does manifest.  I don't know about cyrillic or other
non-ascii characters - but with that one, it worked in the prerelease and not in
1.0.

I suggest increasing the severity because this bug means that all users of
Japanese Windows cannot open files downloaded to the desktop because the desktop
folder is in Japanese. Other international versions of windows may also apply.
For me opening a file with non-ascii characters (german ae umlaut) via "Open
File..." works.
But if I have a file which contains a link to such a file Firefox tells me that
the file cannot be found.
I have an english Windows XP.

I'll create an attachment for this bug containing two test files: "test.html"
and "ärger.html" (the file with the german ae umlaut"). Directly opening the
"ärger.html" file works but opening it with the link in "test.html" doesn't work.

Don't know if bugzilla supports this, but I'll try to attach a Japanese html

This bug seems to extend to other products, including Mozilla Calendar.  When
the calendar (.ics) files are in my Windows "home" dir (C:\Documents and

path with no non-low-ASCII characters, they're fine.  AAARGH!

the un/escape dance is a two-step

What's the rule, then? A URI (whose origin was a string passed in by the
system) spends a moment as a string in this code before it becomes a URI again.
It's an issue with requirements of different downstream APIs. un/escaping seems
to be automatic everywhere except at this step.

I have confirmation from Nickolay (thanks!) that this patch fixes this bug. All
this bug's duplicates would probably also fall to this patch, but I think

the un/escape dance is a two-step

What is the nature of this URL spec?  Do you know that it is really ASCII after
unescaping?  In general, it is a bad idea to unescape random URL strings
because you don't know how the unescape characters are encoded.  (e.g., is it
Shift-JIS?, ISO-8859-1? or what?  only the server knows.)

If you are sure that this is ok, then no problem, but I suspect this could lead
to problems.  Of course, it's possible that any bytes will just be treated as
ISO-8859-1, inflated to UTF-16 that is no problem, and then deflated again at
some point.  Is that what you are betting on?
In general, the only time we should ever need to unescape a file:// URL is when
converting it from a URL to a nsIFile, and that all happens down in the depths
of necko (see NS_GetFileFromURLSpec).

Are you sure there isn't a better way to solve this problem?

 I don't think those two bugs (both suite and firefox have those problems) are
related with this bug. This bug is firefox-specific and Mozilla suite doesn't
have a problem with double-clicking in windows explorer. 

Actually, the other aspect of this bug is not firefox specific (comment #17) nor
a regression. The suite has the same problem.

I've just tried suite and firefox on Linux (UTF-8 locale) and Mac OS X. Both

on Linux, it may have a problem and there are some variations of test cases I

next time you upload a Japanese html file, please add charset paramer in MIME
type and/or add 'meta tag' for charset specification.

In 'about:config', can you check the value of
'network.standard-url.encode-utf8'? It is false by default, but it seems like
it's set to true in your case. With that set to false, I cannot reproduce the
problem on Windows. See also bug 261929. Btw, you also have to make sure that
the character encoding of your html file refering to a local file with non-ASCII
name is set correctly.

In case of html, jpg, png, etc, it works fine. However, if it's a windows media
file (especially specified in object tag) that should be handed over to a WMP
(pluggin), there's a problem.

special-case creation of local file URI

asking for sr

Phew, it took me more than a day (somehow my build didn't start even after
several distclean/rebuild cycles). Attachment 167453 (sans the unnecessary
QI'ing) works fine for double-click-to-open.

The issue in comment #17 (with standard-url.encode-utf8 set to true) had better
be dealt with in another bug, IMO. Yet another problem 
(comment #43) is likely to have  been already reported
NS_NewURI wants an UTF-8 string - is args (urlStr) utf-8 encoded?
(In reply to comment #45)
> NS_NewURI wants an UTF-8 string - is args (urlStr) utf-8 encoded?

I believe so (more likely to be just ASCII) because it's coming from browser.js
(see attachment 166365). Otherwise, coming across XPconnect boundary, I'd have
gotten an assertion fired when I tried it.



but... if it's UTF-8, then won't the NewNativeLocalFile do "the wrong thing",
when the FS charset is != UTF-8?

special-case creation of local file URI

Recent changes in the command line handler made this patch obsolete. I thought
it might have fixed this problem, but we still have the same issue with a
little different symptom.
The toolkit clh? I tried to make it handle commandline args in a
charset-sensitive way. Is there something broken in the "core"?
The first time I tried my build with the new command line handler,
double-clicking on a file with non-ascii path/name with no firefox window
present didn't work. The way it failed was very curious. I tried to open a file 
'가나.html' (set the encoding to UTF-8 to view this comment) on the desktop and
got three alerts. The first one complained that it couldn't find a file
'C/Documents' and following two alerts complained about 'C:\Documents and
Settings/jungshik/Desktop/' and 'C:/Documents and Settings/jungshik/Desktop/가
나.html', respecitvely. 

However, after quitting my debug build and trying it again,
it worked !! I don't understand this, but ....I'll try more. 

The issue in comment #17 will be dealt with in bug 278161 (see also bug 263570).
If the the pref. related with url encoding is set to the old default (which was
false), the problem will be gone. However, it should be set to true for external
urls  so that I'm gonna deal with it in bug 278161.

Firefox Loader .vbs Script

I had icluded a FileSystemObject in the original script that was not needed so
here is it without it.

By the way I tested it on many "complex" html files (with external CSS etc) I
have saved from internet and all open fine without problems.
This fix/patch seems to work on Unicode Chinese file names, but doesn't work for
Big5 Chinese file names. The symptoms after applying Firefox Loader.vbs patch
for opening a file named C:/My Documents/¿i¥É¦æ.html (Big5 Chinese) will open
Firefox showing a page titled
Index of file:///C:/My Documents/???.html
then the list of files in C:/My Documents, without any file names containing
Big5 Chinese characters; i.e. the usual directory listing.

Try opening JPEG files with Big5 Chinese file names using Firefox doesn't work,
either. Firefox opens with alert "The file C:/My Documents/¥É.jpg cannot be
found. Please check the location and try again." and black page.
(In reply to comment #68)
I know what you mean. In my Engish Windows XP I have set all regional options to
Greek. Before I created this script I could only open latin filenames. Now I can
open both greek and latin filenames. But when I try to open a cyrillic filename
I can't and have the same as you. On the other hand I haver never used cyrillic
file names.

From what I understand you are trying to open a file with a filename with
different characters than the ones you have set in your regional options. I
don't think it's possible to solve that with a script.

What you ask seems more like <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162361">Bug 162361 Unicode
file i/o in XPCOM/IO</a>

My scipt is useful to people that use latin and one more alphabet defined in
regional options.
kronosk9981@hotmail.com is right. After I change my regional options to Big5
Chinese, Firefox can open filenames in Big5 Chinese. JPEG with Big5 Chinese
filenames still don't open.

What I really want is more like <a

You should associate .jpg with "firefox loader.vbs" like the html files and not
with firefox.exe. Then they have the same behavior as the html files.
The easiest way to avoid this problem is:
1.Run: regedit
2.Open Key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\shell\open\command
3.Change 'Default' to 'C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -url "file://%1"'. 

Yes, add "file://" before "%1".

4.Try open html files again.
Sorry for the previrous post ... ...

Though FireFox can open the html file, it cannot open other resources that
needed by the html file(such as css, images, javascript, and so on). So it
cannot render the html correctly.

How let FireFox not encode "\" to "%5C"? Maybe this can solve the problem ... ...

a) First appear in final version of Firefox 1.0.
b) Only if the browser is already open.
c) The bug happens if the file is open with the Windows file explorer. (Not with

d) Example: "Mes téléchargements" folder.

a) Was already present and exist in Mozilla too.
b) Happen even if the browser is closed.

Firefox 1.0.2, Windows 2000 + SP4. And I have "a new tab in the most resent
window" setting enabled in "advanced" section of options.

If I have a browser window already open and I click a file with "strange"
characters in it's name, as already pointed out the file won't open to a new tab
and it will give the error message.

But I think no-one pointed out that a new tab is opened in the browser window,
the thing is, it is empty and you can't close it any other way, except by
closing the whole window, or by adding another tab and then closing it. Somehow
the tab with error seems to get locked. The tab should close if user selects
close from the tab menu or if user presses the red x on the corner.

I have the same problem with win2000, all SP, all English.
Firefox 1.0.1 (both russian and english) cannot open local files with russian
names from russian folder names, files and folders are visible from window, but
at the last step it says "no such file or directory".
IE can open such files.

The issue is probably critical for ALL non-native english speakers in US.
So we have to use IE, not firefox, period. 

The bug as I have reported it no longer appears on trunk. Could someone from
developers summarize why this is still open?

Everybody, please don't add comments, unless you have something *new* to say.
Read <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html> for more info.
i found another related problem.

if you try to open more than 1 file at once with cyrillic pathname, you will get
only 1 file opened. doesn't matter in this case if firefox was already opened or
not.

i have also fixed registry using instructions in comment #61. (and it worked
well in single file opening)

to reproduce problem close all firefox windows. select several files with
cyrillic  filenames, and then hit ENTER key, you will get only 1 file opened.

I don't know probably it is a new bug or a duplicate of existing bug.

On non-Chinese Windows? No, it's not. see comment #52, please.

I'm building a trunk build and see if things have gotten better (see comment #56)

I confirmed that it's fixed (see comment #54, comment #55, comment #56 and
comment #100) by bsmedberg's command line handling fix. The issue in comment #17
is dealt with in bug 278161. For issues with Greek /Russian file names on
French/English Windows (and many other variants), see bug 162361 (and please,
don't add any more comment here)

So what attachment do I need to download to fix this for Japanese or will the
patch be in 1.0.6? This is still happening in 1.0.5 and bugs the hell out of me.

Version numbers x.y.z tell you that 
x is for very major changer
y is for major changes
z is for security updates

So you won't get this fixed in 1.0.6 or any of 1.0.z versions. Try latest
nightly build, alpha 2, or wait for 1.1.0 beta, RC or final version.

Ok, is there a patch attached here I can download and use? and not have to wait
months for 1.1 to come out

File with Chinese character does not show up in file list.
I just tested this and I still/again have the problem with todays Deerpark Alpha
2 nightly. A file with a Chinese character does not show up in the view of the
local directory (Win2K-English). See attachment.

I think that is a different Bug #162361
As an addition to comment 115: I also get this message when I double click the
file from Windows Explorer:

"File Not Found Error

The file /C:/Documents and Settings/etmvabe/My Documents/My Skype Received
Files/1521?size.jpg cannot be found. Please check the location and try again.

The file specified by the address (URL) cannot be found. Check that the file
exists and that you have sufficient permissions to view it."

So I was just wondering what was exactly resolved with this bug.

> So I was just wondering what was exactly resolved with this bug.

For example I have Finnish language version of Windows and now if I open a file
that has characters on Finnish charset, those files open correctly with Deer
park Alpha 2, while they don't open correctly with Firefox 1.0.6. So that is
what is fixed and that is the reason why this bug is fixed.

The other bug I mentioned previously is about opening files that contain
characters outside of the operating system charset (for example Chinese
characters on English-version of Windows). Which I think is the case with you.
And that bug is still not fixed.

On my Windows Xp no images,stylesheets or other relative resources are loaded
unless the backslashes (%5C) when opening a local file are replaced with slashes
(/) in the adress bar. 

Therefore 
<img src="./test.jpg"> 
in file:///C:%5Ctest.htm wont be opened, but in file:///C:/test.htm it will.

This makes the whole thing worthless on Windows, I'm really wondering why this
bug hasn't been fixed yet..

Have you tried a trunk build available at
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk ?

Yeah, the bug in Windows users who assume that file URLs are supposed to have  
backslashes in them, is a long-standing one which will probably never be fixed.  
The problem is that windows uses the standard of \ instead of / as A filename,
so If Any file is opened with firefox it screwes up, since firefox serves the
service of opening local files itself it should recognise that problem for
Windows users.

Fact is that on windows backslashes ARE served by windows if you tell it to open
a file with a program, that is a thing I can't change. As the file:// function
generally works on windows and the file associations are set by firefox it
should also work with the standard way files are opened with - or just not port
the feature to windows, but opening the file despite the backslashes, but not
any external files containing relative references sucks. 

By the way - when was this fixed? - I'm using 1.0.6 and it does not work at all...

Unless it's noted differently, 'resolved fixed' means that it's fixed on the
trunk (as opposed to any branches like 1.0.x). See comment #124. It's NOT fixed
on 1.0.x. If you don't wanna try a nightly, you can try DeerPark 1.1alpha2. 




I am now working with DeerPark (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US;
rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+). Some aspects of this bug still exist in
DeerPark, makes it worse than in Firefox 1.0.x. You may want to reopen this bug
as a regression bug.
I have a page with charset windows-1255, with a link to a non-ASCII7 file. When
trying to follow the link, DeerPark fails to open the url as it is trying to
open the UTF8 encoding of the url rather than the FS-encoding of the URL. In
fireox 1.0.x, it opened the url without any problem.
Also openning non-ASCII7 files from the directory listing ("index of ...")
doesn't work in DeerPark for the same reason.

Zvi: that's not what this bug was about. This is about opening files from other
applications. Your bug is about opening files through a link from another
webpage. Please look if your bug is already reported, and if it isn't, please
file it separately.

Is this a regression? Tested with FX 1.5.0 on Windows XP French, foreign characters turn into question marks (%3F) in the address bar when trying to drag and drop a file or via the commandline, and they turn into underscores when trying to open via File>Open File.

See also 111428, 174734, 235495 for bookmark-related bugs that exhibit the lack of proper support for files with foreign filenames.

No, this bug is not about file names with characters NOT covered by the current ANSI codepage (e.g. Chinese characters in French Windows) but about non-ASCII characters *covered* by the current ANSI code page (e.g. Latin letters with diacritic marks in French Windows). See bug 162361 for your problem and bugs depending on it. I've been working on bug 162361.

The bug appears to be back. Firefox crashes when trying to open
http://www.cafeoflifepikespeak.com/Videos/Licensed%20To%20Pill.swf

The file crashes firefox everytime. I can download the file and play it in konqueror without problems, but even if I rename the file to remove the %20 the file still crashed firefox. See:

http://www.3111skyline.com/Licensed_To_Pill.swf

This might be a firefox/shockwave issue.


David: that issue seems entirely unrelated to this bug?


Not knowing more, the non-ascii problem looked related. I agree that if it is a pure shockwave problem, then this bug is irrelevent. Just thought I would post here before you had to expend the effort to tell me it was a duplicate. I'll search further.
