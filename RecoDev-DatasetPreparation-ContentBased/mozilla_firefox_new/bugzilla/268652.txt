In the page at http://arc1087.com/Projects/Sylvan%20Way/ProjSylvan.htm, the
iframe (middle right text box) will jump around (top left, then top, the current
position) when moving mouse around the top navigation button to show pull down
menus. And it makes it impossible to access the pulldown menu just on the top of
iframe.

The iframe will stay if change the position to absolute.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://arc1087.com/Projects/Sylvan%20Way/ProjSylvan.htm
2. Move mouse on the top graphics buttons.
3. Cannot move mouse over the pulldown menus of the right side.

Actual Results:  
Annoying iframe jump. Cannot access the right side pulldown menus above the iframe

Expected Results:  
No object jump in the screen, can access the right side pulldown menu. (IE
sounds ok)

The problem will go if set the iframe's position is absolute.

The iframe is inside a float:left div.
This bug is already fixed in current trunk (1.8a) builds (I don't see the bug in
there). This fix is not in the branch/Aviary/1.7 builds (I can see the bug in
those builds).
It was fixed by the fix for bug 238493. Hence why I'm marking this fixed.
