When you select set as wallpaper and try out the different "position":s, the
preview stops working after testing 2 options.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Right click an image an "set as wallpaper"
2. Switch between the 3 positions availabe to see the preview
3. After selecting at least 2 options the other options stop to work

This regressed in March 8 builds.  (Some builds I tested were unofficial, so
don't assume they were made at 8am.)

02/16: dialog introduced
02/19: selecting "tile" does nothing
03/06: selecting "tile" does nothing
03/07: selecting "tile" does nothing      \ 
03/08: selecting "stretch" does nothing   /  regression window
03/20: selecting "stretch" does nothing
In setWallPaper.xul, these constants need to be updated to reflect the changes
made when moving from winhooks to shellservice:

ISS.WALLPAPER_TILE -> ISS.BACKGROUND_TILE

and

ISS.WALLPAPER_STRETCH -> ISS.BACKGROUND_STRETCH

Making those changes fixes it for me.
Fixed.
This is only kind of fixed, it updates center and stretch, but not tile...
Reopen or file a new bug?
Tile never worked.  See
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/content/setWallpaper.xul#111.
File a new bug.
Thanks for the info, bug 239618 was filed.
