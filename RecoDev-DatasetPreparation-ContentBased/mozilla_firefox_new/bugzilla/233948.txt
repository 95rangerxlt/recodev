In Firefox 0.8, the image on the about dialog has been updated, but when the
Credits button is clicked the old flame image is displayed.  We should have
something that compliments the image on the about dialog for the credits dialog.

A slightly larger version of the following image might make for a good candidate:

The about dialog on the trunk doesn't have the credits button, so if that
feature is never going to be landed on the trunk go ahead and invalidate this.

That link in the original post was supposed to be:

Just wanted to note that the credits dialog landed on the trunk sometime after I
submitted this report, so we will definitely need an image for it now.
CC'ing Jon Hicks since he did the new logo and icons.
Currently being worked on  - should be with Ben Ben Goodger by the end of the week
