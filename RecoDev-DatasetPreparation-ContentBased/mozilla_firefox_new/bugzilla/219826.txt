In some web pages, it appears that some fonts specified by the web page's HTML
are not being used.  For example, consider this fragment of code:


<html>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS, arial" size="4"><b><strong>
    <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">
    Slashdot!</a>
  </strong></b></font>
<P>
  <font face="comic sans ms, arial" size="4"><b><strong>
    <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">
    Slashdot!</a>
  </strong></b></font>
</html>


As you can tell, only the word "Slashdot!" should appear (twice) in the Comic
Sans MS font (twice to make sure the bug was not a case sensativity issue). 
This did work at one time with Mozilla 1.3.  I had my roommate test this bug out
and for his browser, the bug is not present.  His is Mozilla 1.4:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030908 Debian/1.4-4

The font requested is definitely available to the system, for example The GIMP
can see it and display it without issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Create a web page using the code fragment above.  Or visit www.susans.org
(Warning: Alternative lifestyle website)
Actual Results:  
The web page from which the code above was taken (and modified), was displayed
in the browser's default "sans serif" font.  Similiarly the code by itself

Expected Results:  
The web page should have been displayed in the specified font.

Sorry for the oddly cut-off lines.  In "Expected results" ignore the sentance
fragment reading "Similiarly the code by itself".
Oh heck I can't even correct an error without making an error.  Jeez.  "Actual
Results" being the part with the unintended sentance fragment if that isn't obvious.

Sorry for the excess spammage.
WFM winXP Gecko/20030913 Firebird/0.6.1+
and Gecko/20030923 Firebird/0.7+
Works for me using Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5)
Gecko/20031003 Firebird/0.7

Probably a temporary regression that was fixed on the trunk.  Does this occur in
current official nightlies? (I can tell from the oddball versions in the UA
string that you're building from CVS)


Sorry for the late response (moving/relocating cross-country).  It seems this
bug has been fixed in 0.7.


some fonts not being loaded properly
