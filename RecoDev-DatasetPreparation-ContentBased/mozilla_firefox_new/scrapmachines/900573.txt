This is a regression.
Turns out that actually no code change from any point of view. the same number of styles apply to the texts. The only difference is that the ordering of the CSS files that get applied is different now.

Earlier the ordering was random : http://i.snag.gy/UEhyp.jpg
and now it is sorted : http://i.snag.gy/LBahw.jpg

I think the only thing we can do now is to add a !important to the color style in layout-view.jsm .

Triggered by Bug 897672. So, I think this is a intentional behavior.

Thanks Alice for finding it out!

Indeed. It was broken-working previously, now it is fixed-broken! :P

Adding !important is the only option here.

I doubt that... surely we just need to increase the specificity.

Sorry, I did not understand what you mean here ...

Fix.

Increasing the specificity would work. But it's not worth it I think. !important works.
and moreover, I think the specificity was decreased on a purpose : re bug 879692
err. sorry. disregard my last comment.
