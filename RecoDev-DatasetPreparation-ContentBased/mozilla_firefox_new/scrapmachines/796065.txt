To show that there's content in a node without needing to expand it, we should indicate with a "...", like Chrome.

It should be a grey or something that's not the same color as text content.

<div class="content">...</div>

using an ellipses with surrounding space, as simply using ellipses was too narrow.

IMO, "..." feels better, but not sure to use that or not.

Is this ever going to happen?  The summary element is hidden when expanded, no?

The other nodes here use an expanded attribute with a :not([expanded]) rule in markup-view.css.  I don't particularly care whether we use direct manipulation or attribute+style here, but would be nice to be consistent.

patch v1.1

comments addressed.
Before landing, please make a note that this patch uses " â€¦ " instead of "...".

I personally like "..." though :)
Why is this patch a mix of 2 bugs? Please split that in 2 patches in 2 different bugs.
