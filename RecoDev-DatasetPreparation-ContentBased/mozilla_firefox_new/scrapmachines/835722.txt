Two situations when the infobar reappears even if it is not required to.

1) Open inspector and lock and node (or even not)
2) Switch to some other tool, lets say Web Console
3) Infobar disappears (the Highlighter)
3) Refresh the page.
4) Infobar reappears.

1) Open inspector and select any node.
2) Select a non node element, like a comment or script or head using the markup view.
3) Infobar disappears.
4) Move your mouse in the Rules side bar, and now move outside of it.
5) Infobar reappears, with the previously selected node selected.

In both the cases infobar should not reappear.

*** Bug 839398 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
any chance of a fix for this before the merge on Feb 18th? This is an annoying bug.
I can take a look at this on Friday (if no one has fixed it yet).
The short version: instead of hiding the highlighter, let's destroy it when the inspector is not selected.

The main issue here is that we have 'hide' and 'show' functions, and we call 'show' a little too easily.

What I would do, for now, is to just destroy the highlighter when the inspector is not selected. In the future, I'd like to move the highlighter at the toolbox level (so other tools could use it) and we will then have a better control on how to show/hide it.
How about in the highlighter, or inspector, maintain a state which will tell whether to show the highlighter or not. So even if the user calls show(), infobar will not appear if the state says hide.
Both approach would work I guess. Killing is safer than hiding I think. I'd say it's up to the one who will fix this bug :)
It was bound to happen!
I think so :)

No test?

patch v1.0

What about renaming "forceHidden" to "disabled"?

Why wasn't just the test disabled ?
(In reply to Girish Sharma [:Optimizer] from comment #21)
> Why wasn't just the test disabled ?

Because it's the decision of the reviewer whether something can land without [enabled] tests, also in many cases disabled tests stay that way forever.

Okay, anyways it was just next on my list and since this landed in Nightly only, I still have time to get this relanded.
Any update on this?
I have a patch, but I want to test it locally first. From past 2 days, I have been struggling with Clobbers :|
Even clobbers are failing for me (without any patch, just the latest fx-team).

So once my firefox is built, I will test and submit the patch.
