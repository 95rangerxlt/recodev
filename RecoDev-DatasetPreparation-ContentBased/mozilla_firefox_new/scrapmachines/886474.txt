When you are in Debugger or Style Editor, Ctrl + ] and Ctrl + [ are used to match brackets, due to which we cannot use those shortcuts to switch tools as we want in bug 879219.

After discussing on IRC with Victor and Mihai, we came up with a consensus to change the source-editor's shortcuts. The most favorable shortcut is Ctrl + M and Ctrl + Shift + M. But if we are not happy with that, we can do Ctrl + Alt + ] [ .

Oh, I forgot to mention why Ctrl + M is favorable: because its used by Sublime Text

patch v0.1

Thanks! r+ with green try push.

Trying to use Ctrl+Alt+[/] doesn't seem to have any effect, but Ctrl+Shift+[/] works. Inspecting the patch confirms that. The problem with that however, is that on OS X at least, this shortcut conflicts with the shortcut to switch tabs, which makes bracket matching only work in a detached toolbox.

Let's either use the agreed upon shortcut or use a different one on OS X.
Whoops. Fix coming.
