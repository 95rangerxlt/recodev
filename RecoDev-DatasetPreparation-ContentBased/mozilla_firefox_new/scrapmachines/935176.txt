Probably a Firefox 27 regression.
Bet it's from CodeMirror migration.
I wonder why no tests broke ...
and right now browser debugger is broken to get to the root of it .. :(

try this, fix display name bug as well

In the process of trying out this patch I noticed an even deeper problem. Saving a stylesheet to file doesn't update the display name (or the star).

1) Open style editor
2) Save the first style sheet to a file "areghjie.css" on disk
3) Name isn't updated to "areghjie.css" and star doesn't go away after saving it.

This patch seems to fix both problems, and they seem to be part of the same issue. Does this patch work for you Girish?

Take that back, this will resolve the filename issue I was seeing as well. Cheers.

instead of having two "change" listeners, combine?

`editor.summary` should work instead of `gUI._view.getSummaryElementByOrdinal(0)`.
