simple fix

I want to change the pointer for the closing tag too. But couldn't figure out.
Merging this patch with the patch in bug 796065 as they were too close to each other and I did not do an 'hg qnew bug2' before starting on that bug and I realized midway.

I can't land that. I need one checkin per bug.
