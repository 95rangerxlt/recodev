Latest Aurora (30) build on OS X.

STR:
1. Load the test case URL
2. Open the web console
3. Evaluate "window.document". Verify this outputs something like "HTMLDocument"
4. Evaluate "window[0].document". Observe this outputs nothing, presumably because it's a cross-origin iframe and access is not allowed
5. Try evaluating "window.document" again. Observe this outputs nothing.

Expected:
In step 4 some sane output should be displayed. Step 5 should be identical to step 3.

FWIW, works fine on Nightly.
I have a Nightly build from Feb 12 and yeah it works fine there. Presumably this broke and was fixed but the fix missed the 30 train?
Actually I can reproduce this in the latest nightly as well. Exact same steps on a new tab in a fresh profile. The nightly in comment 2 was just really old, probably before this broke, so the regression window is somewhere between Feb 2 and today.

Ahh. So autocomplete suggestions are breaking it :


error occurred while processing 'autocomplete: Error: Permission denied to access objectLine: 1063, column: 4 main.js:1007
onPacket threw an exception: Error: Server did not specify an actor, dropping packet: {"error":"unknownError","message":"error occurred while processing 'autocomplete: Error: Permission denied to access objectLine: 1063, column: 4"}

The way I was able to get it work in my last comment was to :

- type "window.document" and evaluate .
- Press up to get "window.document", press Right multiple times and add "[0]" after window

:D That did not trigger autocomplete suggestions and thus worked fine. 


And yeah, the whole devtools for that tab messes up as server thinks that the tab is still connected. [Devtools still work on other tabs]

This patch fixes the problem reported.

I'm using makeInfaillable() because it is looking to me less than ideal to wrap more completion code in try-catches.

Try push: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=5f44f303c910

This is probably a regression caused by bug 842682, made more obvious by bug 943586. We should get this patch landed in aurora as well.

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): probably caused by bug 842682, made more obvious by bug 943586.
User impact if declined: the webconsole breaks if the user tries to type a JS string that points to an object from a different domain. it seems the breakage is pretty bad - devtools stop working.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): green try push, landed in fx-team and m-c.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): minimal - the patch makes any error in autocomplete code to be non-fatal.
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: none.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/9223243c65a2
Flagging in-testsuite+ since this landed with tests.
