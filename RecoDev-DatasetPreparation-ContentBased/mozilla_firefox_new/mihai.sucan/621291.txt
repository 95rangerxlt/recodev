cc'ing l10n because I'm not sure about the impact here and what our timing should be in fixing this (as soon as possible? post-firefox 4?)
did this ever get fixed?
No. This bug is still valid. I can fix this in an upcoming patch for the netpanel - the LongStringActor UI changes for the netpanel (bug 787981).
