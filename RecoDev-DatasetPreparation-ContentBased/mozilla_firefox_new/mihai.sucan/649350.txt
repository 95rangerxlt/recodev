"It seems wrong that the ConsoleAPIObserver (a completely separate object) is
responsible for shutting down the HUDService (i.e. calling
HUDService.shutdown()). It also seems wrong for the HUDWindowObserver to be
doing it. Shouldn't the HUDService have its own observer that shuts itself
down? Removing as many inter-dependencies as possible seems like it would
simplify things..."

This is going to be fixed by the next WIP patch I'll submit for bug 673148.
