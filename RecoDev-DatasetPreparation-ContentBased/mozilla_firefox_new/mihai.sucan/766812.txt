Thanks for your bug report. I will look into this.
I was able to reproduce by closing the Web Console before the page fully loaded.

Problem: NRL_onDataAvailable() continues to be called after HUDService-content.js destroys itself (once the user closes the Web Console). NetUtil and NetworkHelper are both used within NRL for keeping the network request ongoing, until it "naturally" stops. This patch no longer removes NetUtil and NetworkHelper to ensure safe functioning of NRL. This should cause no memleaks.

We probably want this in Aurora as well?

"should cause no memory leaks". Let's verify with a Try run. R+ on completion of that.
Thank you!

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): bug 673148 - in the fight with memory leaks we ended up with nulling out some objects imported from JSM's. Network-related helper functions should not be nulled out to prevent any breakage in network request handling.
User impact if declined: If the Web Console is closed during network requests there might show an error in the error console. Otherwise, things should be fine.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): several green try runs, green runs in fx-team and m-c team. No problems until now.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): None.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None.
