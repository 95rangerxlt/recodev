Currently the WebConsole has three ways for clearing the output:

HUDService.clearDisplay(id)
JSTerm.clearOutput()
HeadsUpDisplay.clearConsoleOutput() - this is never used and it fails.

I bumped into this issue when writing a test code. I had the HeadsUpDisplay object and I wanted to call clearConsoleOutput(), but that failed. Then I saw the rest of the available methods that do the same thing.

We should probably fix the clearConsoleOutput() method or remove it.

fix + test code

Proposed fix and test code. This patch should apply cleanly on mozilla-central.

The fix is only limited to the HeadsUpDisplay.clearConsoleOutput() method.
perhaps we only need 2 methods, the jsterm and the working hudservice one?
Sure, we can go for that. Shall I post a patch that removes the HeadsUpDisplay.clearConsoleOutput() method? (marking the current patch as obsolete, obviously)

Yeah, less code is good. Make sure no other callers exist.

[checked-in] patch for removing the method

Updated patch - removed the method. It is unused, so no other changes are needed.
We can put this up for review, since it's just a trivial removal of code.

While I'm here, a=sdwilsh with a simple, only code removal, change.
