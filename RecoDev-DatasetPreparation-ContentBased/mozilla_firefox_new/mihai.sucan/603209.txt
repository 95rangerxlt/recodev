Had to disable a few checks in this test due to timing issues where the http response is too slow for our check to get anything but an undefined value.

We should probably turn this test into several tests and ditch the generator approach where possible.

It seems that accessing 'httpActivity.response.body' sometime returns undefined.

similar to the problems I was seeing in bug 589089. In that bug, the test is actually failing because of the _getContent() method was throwing an error and not returning anything sane.

Check whatever's supposed to be setting httpActivity.response.body to see if it's doing what it's supposed to. Or, it could be timing as these things get updated asynchronously after the load.

In general, I don't think the generator approach is *bad* per se, but we might want to split up the individual sections into function as you suggest and go to the next one on generator.next(). I think they'd be easier to follow that way.

Proposed fix.

The test file had only small bugs that needed to be fixed. However, as recommended I also refactored the code to not use a generator, but clearer, more concise functions.

All tests pass, in debug and opt builds. No memleaks.

Easier to follow, looks good. Was this tested with compartments?

I wold like to kill all executeSoon calls, but this test is all network, so maybe not possible?

Just tested. It runs fine with compartments, and the patch still applies cleanly.

Agreed, but there's a balance we need to strike. We need a bit of delays between each test. My thought is: if it runs fine, we should let it like that. :)

Thanks for the feedback+!
