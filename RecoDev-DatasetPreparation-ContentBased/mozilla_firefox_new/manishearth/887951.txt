"Customize and Control UX" isn't user-friendly.

"Customize and Control UX" isn't user-friendly.
To fix this bug, you'll need to clone the repository at https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/.

Matej, clicking on this button brings the user to the "Firefox" menu, which allows for making changes to Firefox (Full Screen, Preferences, Customize) as well as operating Firefox (New Window, Save Page, Exit) etc. Can you think of something better than "Customize and Control brandShortName"?
Can I get a little more context as to where this appears and what the issue is with the current string? Thanks.
This appears when hovering over the menu button in Nightly UX builds.

Matt filed the bug, so I'll defer to him about what is wrong with the current string.
Matej - if you come over to my desk, I can show you the tooltip in context.
I call this button the "Menu Button" in that it brings up the menu.

One approach would be to have the tooltip just reflect that -- i.e., "Menu," "Tools Menu," or "Firefox Menu."

Another would be to be more descriptive -- i.e., "Tools and Customization."
I think something like the options in comment 5 could work, I just worry that "tools" may not be the best descriptor. Maybe something like "preferences" instead?

My other thought was to make this more actionable and less descriptive. It could even be, dare I say it, a tad whimsical.

Maybe it's something like "Mission control" or "Tweaks & fiddles."

I believe mconley is also reaching out to product marketing so we can all get on the same page about what this menu should be called — whether or not we use that for the tooltip.

What I ended up doing was asking in the Australis weekly meeting, which got Madhava in here. Asa was also in the call, and didn't pipe up mentioning a particular name that Product was interested in pushing, so I think Madhava's data is stuff we can run with.
To be honest, when I filed the bug, I thought that "UX" was hard-coded as a temporary tooltip and not &brandShortName;. The other aspect was that I thought it was putting a bit too much emphasis on customization considering that it's not a very common task.
While somewhat boring, I think "Firefox Menu" or simply "Menu" is the most straightforward.

Oops, forgot to edit in the directory in the previous patch (had a build running, so I couldn't hg at the root level and had to edit the diff manually).

I'm not sure if we've settled on a name yet.

The options so far are:
1. Tools and Customization
2. Customize and control Firefox
3. Customize and Control Firefox
4. Mission control
5. Tweaks & fiddles
6. Menu

Madhava, I'll let you make the call here. Which one should we use?
Manish, Madhava is on vacation for the next two weeks, so I'm not expecting an answer very soon from him.

I will try to find another bug for you to work on in the meantime, so far your first patch looks good!

You forgot some from Madhava in comment 5:

Alright, thanks :)
Any decision on this yet?
We should look at this together with the extra tip in bug 870593.

Where by we, I mean I. And Mnovak.
Madhava and I chatted about this today and here's what we came up with:

Open menu
> Open menu


Isn't that a bit redundant?

Patch for "open menu"

Since this is a code change, it's best to let a developer look at this. That, and Jared is your mentor on this one!
Ah, I thought the code change had been vetted, it was just the wording change that mattered.

Thanks.

Hi Manish, thanks for the patch. Because this text has been on mozilla-central already, we'll need to also change the entity name in the dtd. You can use appmenu.title2

Changed all instances of `appmenu.title` to `appmenu.title2` to trigger l10n changes.

As far as I can tell, the title attribute on the toolbaritem node is completely useless; you should drop it and call the entity appmenu.tooltip.
