Possibly. Investigating now, and I'll see what I find out.
Unable to reproduce bug 1124881, so I've needinfo'd blassey.

I can still reproduce this one though, and the problem here is that we're not swapping the mBrowserDOMWindow's on the TabParent's when we swap remote frame loaders. Patch coming up.

I assume because I have no direct access to the nsIBrowserDOMWindow pointers under TabParent that there's no other way of doing this?
Thanks for the fast review!
