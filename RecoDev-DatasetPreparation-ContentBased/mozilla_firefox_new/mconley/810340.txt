Bug 794752 fixed the problem where the downloads button resized itself on first click.

Now it looks like the OSX button isn't wide enough for its potential contents. I'll attach a screenshot with an example.

Demonstration of the problem
This could be solved by bug 801832.
yes, otherwise we should set again a min-width, but this time properly, on both the placeholder and the indicator.

Let's just do this for now.

It might be strange for the button to be slightly wider than the "Home" button, but not as wide as the "Bookmarks" button. Should we try to make it the same width as the Bookmarks button?
There is a third alternative, reduce contents size just a bit, maybe it's enough to slightly reduce time left font-size.

I'm not sure how much wider the button should be honestly, it's a new kind of magic button...
or we may ask mstange or dao if there's possibility to enlarge all the buttons by a couple pixels, I don't know what the current width is based on

I just tried reducing the font-size, and I'm actually quite pleased with the result. I'll post up a new patch and some screenshots.

Screenshot with patch applied

"m" was the widest character of the set that goes next two the two digits, and that one doesn't seem to cause the button expansion anymore.

do you feel like the button contents look centered by using it?
This seems to push the progressbar up by 1 px by reducing the line-height, and looking at the sshot with rulers, the bottom light shadow of the progress bar is indeed 1px higher than the bottom light shadow of the arrow. I'd not want to have content packed up at the top of the button, that may look weird.

Widening the progress bar

Hm - alright, I see your point there.

We could take this opportunity to increase the height and visibility of the progress bar (which, IMO, is pretty thin on OSX).

See screenshot.

Thoughts?

This looks fine, but please check we are not breaking the Pause state now, when we show the arrow instead of the counter, since the progress is taller it may touch the arrow and you may have to reduce it by 1px as well...

Paused looks fine - lots of clearance from the tip of the arrow to the progressmeter. Thanks for the r+!
