It looks like a UI migration slipped in from m-c and nobody noticed - that'd be from bug 870112.

Our numbers are off now - currentUIVersion < 13 is now applied to two migrations - the one from bug 870112 and the one from bug 573329. This means that the one for bug 870545 needs to be bumped too.

Should we coalesce all the UX branch migrations into a single one?
I don't see precedent in the other migrations for that sort of thing (and I would have expected to see it in the Firefox 4 changes) so my instincts are kinda against it.
