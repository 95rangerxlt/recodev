Bug 859776 added separators before dropmarkers and between consecutive toolbarbuttons within a toolbaritem (like the zoom / edit controls).

This is fine, except that it adds a separator between the back and forward buttons in the urlbar-container, which is superfluous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

r=me for now, but let's have a followup about why this is navbar specific, and if it's that specific, whether we should change it to be specific to certain buttons rather than excluding other stuff, or make it more general and override the urlbar-container the way add-ons would have to override their own split buttons.
