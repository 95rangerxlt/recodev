The error handler didn't catch today's out-of-a-valid-key error as a permanent failure (service unavailable) because it looks for the strings "TranslationApiException" and "balance" in the response body, but this is the response body that we are getting today:

<html><body><h1>TranslateApiException</h1><p>Method: TranslateArray()</p><p>Message: The Azure Market Place Translator Subscription associated with the request credentials is not in an active state.</p><code></code><p>message id=5641.V2_Rest.TranslateArray.48CC6470</p></body></html>

Note: a permanent failure doesn't mean forever, it just means for the session. If it's judged as permanent, the "Service is unavailable, try again later" message shows up, instead of "There was an error, [Try again]" message+button.

Iaroslav, are you perhaps interested in taking this bug too, as you already worked on another one in the translation feature? This one is a lot simpler, but it's an important one, and we will likely uplift it to Aurora so it's a cool opportunity to learn how that works.
If you wanna check a bit of the history here, here's where the service unavailable handling was implemented: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/1200d0aa0fc3

Hi, Felipe! Thanks for pointing me to this bug. Yes, I would definitely like to work on this.

Adds lack-of-valid-key error handling as Service Unavailable error.

Hey, Felippe!

Sorry, for taking so long for the fix. The fix code was pretty trivial as you said. But I had some issues with the test. As you see in the patch I had to modify bing.sjs to add rejection message for requests signed with a special "inactive" token. This approach forced me to end up writing a function for resetting token in BingTranslator. Otherwise authentication would not re-run. Would be great to hear your opinion on this.

Thanks a lot! Both the fix and the test looks great. I'll send it to tryserver, and in the meantime, you can update the patch with the nit below. And then I'll land it!

nit: "Borrow from browser_translation_bing.js" doesn't make much sense here since it's this file :)

The comment removed ("Deduce server URL" was pretty useful), so if you don't mind let's re-add it

Hi, Felipe!

Thanks for the feedback! I updated the patch to as you suggested. And pushed it to the try server. Here are the links:

Hey, Felipe!

Thanks for checking the code in. Does it mean this bug is resolved?

I would like to continue working on translation. Do you have any other bugs that should be fixed soon?

Hey there. Yeah! Just to explain the process, we check in the code into one of the integration branches: fx-team or mozilla-inbound. If all tests pass on that check-in, it remains there, and periodically (a few times per day), the sheriffs will merge these branches into mozilla-central and automatically mark the bug as resolved for us.

I'll CC you into some interesting bugs (in my opinion). There's a few others that I know but I haven't filed yet, I'll file them soon and let you know. And you can always browse the open bugs to find out what interests you. Here's a link for the translation component: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Firefox&component=Translation&resolution=---
