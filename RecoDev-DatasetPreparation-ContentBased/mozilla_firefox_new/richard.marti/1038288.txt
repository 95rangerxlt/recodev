updateInContentStyles.patch

I removed the header icons and the 60px margin on the left like the mockup shows. I made the connected textbox and button generic to apply on all such elements (for example on Connections dialog in Advanced pane, when it land) like Chameleon wants it.

I also improved a little bit the margins of the in-content dialogs title and actionButtons but the fine finish of them will be done in bug 1036090.
