Screenshot of too much space

The Tracking Protection UI that was introduced in bug 1031033 has a lot of blank space around it and within it.

We should remove the <separator>s and an odd <spacer> that is in the Do Not Track section. While cleaning this up, the markup of the "Prevent sites from tracking me" and the "Tell sites that I do not want to be tracked" is quite different and can be made the same.

These changes should be made in both:
/browser/components/preferences/in-content/privacy.xul
/browser/components/preferences/privacy.xul

With extra space removed and labels indented

This is a screenshot of what we could make it look like if we remove the separators, the spacer, and indent the labels by 32px. 32px is calculated because the checkbox is 21px wide, has 1px of border-end-width, and 10px of margin-end.
That was my fault about the separators. That patch was originally written when DNT had a 3-state UI and someone asked for more separation between the 2.

I had to put a hbox around the text-link labels because the labels have !important margins. Directly applying the indent class to the labels would need to add the !important to .indent in CSS.

Is it okay like this or should I go with the change in CSS?

This change looks good. Can you please make the same change to the non-in-content preferences privacy.xul file too?

Sorry, I should have said this in the previous review. This entity should only be indented two spaces from the start of the <label> tag, like it was before this patch. Otherwise right now it looks like it is an attribute on the element.

This should also be changed in the other file too.

I'm not sure it makes sense to verify this now. It's already 2 months since it was fixed and is due to change again shortly.
