Example of border draw issue with zotero library pane

Hi,

I think this is a possible regression in Nightly. When the zotero Library navigation pane is being displayed, items in it are being drawn with an unusual border around them that did not previously exist.

See the attachments to show before and after.

The example of before.

The before snapshot is attached here. Also, if I get a chance, I'll try and bisect to turn up when this started.
Shaddy Baddah: This may very well be a Nightly regression, but if you're seeing an issue solely in Zotero (as with this bug and bug 878679), you should post to our forums at https://forums.zotero.org rather than here. We'll review such reports and, if necessary, create bugs here with minimal testcases. The Mozilla developers can't be expected to dig through the Zotero code to figure out whether something is a Zotero issue or a Mozilla one. (You also don't even say what version of Zotero you're running. We frequently fix Nightly issues in Zotero dev builds, so a report isn't helpful if you don't include version information—again, in the Zotero Forums.)
The last known good is:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013-07-16-03-02-02-mozilla-central/

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5976b9c673f8

First known bad:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013-07-17-03-02-07-mozilla-central/

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0888e29c83a3

Significant to me, seemingly unrelated bug 888787 "FoxyProxy toolbar button is rendered as a giant sprite sheet (with many icons)" resolves itself in between these two builds as well. At least for me, when I run 2013-07-16 I see the sprite sheet, and when I run 2013-07-17-03, I see the correct FoxyProxy icon.

To me, that seems to large a coincidence to ignore. But I yield to expert opinion.

Understood. I'll post on the listed forum. And for the record, I'm running v4.0.9 of Zotero.
OK, it looks like with the new default Windows theme in the latest Nightly—presumably after bug 855998—seltype="cell" on a tree causes there to be thick black borders with rounded corners around cells.

I don't recall why we're using seltype="cell", and we may be able to switch to seltype="single", but it looks like the new theme will need to be fixed for seltype="cell" if it's to continue to be supported.
Confirmed, bug 855998 broke non-places trees somehow.
Just to clarify, this isn't about Places vs. non-Places trees. Our trees are fine with seltype="single". It's seltype="cell" that has this problem, including in Places if the trees are modified to use seltype="cell" via the DOM Inspector. I didn't check other seltype modes.
Strangely the rule at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/windows/global/tree.css#60 should be more specific than the rule at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/windows/global/tree-aero.css#67 but it looks as it isn't.

With adding !important to border and background-color and adding background-image: none !important; the seltype="cell" and seltype="text" are looking as before.

As written in comment 8 I've added the !important plus the background-image: none !important;

I could also add this to tree-aero.css but I think it has no negative effects on XP and like this we have no additional rule on aero.

The latter sets "border-style: solid" with !important, which would explain why that overrides "border: none". Can that !important be dropped?

Yes, I've directly added the border-style: solid; to treechildren::-moz-tree-row(current, focus) and treechildren::-moz-tree-row(selected, current, focus). Then only the background-image: none; was needed in tree.css. Now no !important is needed. Thank you for the hint.

I tested this with the IndexedDB Browser and it works.

Verified as fixed on Firefox 25 beta 6 - there are no unusual borders in the Zotero Library Navigation pane (I could reproduce the initial issue also with Zotero 4.0.12 using a Nightly build from July 26th).
