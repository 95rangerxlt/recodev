Icon sets

Here's a bunch of PNGs with the new icon inside (last one on the right).
I think the icons for Linux are the same as for Windows at the moment.

There are several different sprite sets for Windows, this zipfile only has one. Can you provide the other ones as well?
Could you point me to the assets needed?
I can't find them in the source of mozilla-central;

In m-c, they are:

browser/themes/windows/Toolbar.png
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-lunaSilver.png
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-aero.png
browser/themes/windows/Toolbar-inverted.png (for dark LWTs)

There are also separate files for Windows 8, but they've not been checked in yet. See bug 960517.
As discussed in IRC, the icon is not needed for toolbars. We'll keep using just text there to avoid having identical icons in the toolbar or wasting even more space.

I double checked and the icons included in the attachment are all that are needed for the menu panel (Linux is identical to Windows).

Ehm, actually, there's two different menuPanel sprites - one 'normal' and one for aero. The difference is the white highlight. See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/menuPanel-aero.png vs. http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/menuPanel.png . Your zipfile only has one. :-(

(so you totally can't see this on mxr because transparency and white show up the same - if you use the devtools inspector to make the image background grey, it's pretty obvious)

menuPanel icon sets.zip

You are (again) right, sorry about that!
The attached icon set should now include all platforms (including some icons for Windows 8).
And then I realized we don't have a real icon for the SDK items because they're toolbaritems. Sigh.
So I poked more at this last night, and I could get the icon to show up using just a ::before element, but it pushed down the button as a whole and just generally didn't work well. :-(

The best way to fix this would be to have a real replacement toolbarbutton in all these widgets that gets created by the SDK. The toolbaritem the SDK uses also shouldn't have the margins it does when it's in the panel or palette. Matteo, do you have time to help with this?

SDK items are currently represented only by their text. The iframe provided by the add-on is hidden. You can drag the empty space where the icon would normally be, but from a UX perspective, it's a pretty bad experience.
We're talking about SDK Widget, right?
Gijs, we can try to sort it out together, I'm not sure the best way to fix it and didn't break the customization thing; without a massive change on widget code (that is a deprecated API): Could we just add a xul:image hidden in the toolbaritems and show it when we are in customization mode? Or a whole toolbarbutton inside a toolbaritem?
The icons here are now out of date because the 'email link' icon got added at the end. :-(

Icon sets including email icon

Here's a new icon set that includes both the new email link icon as well as the default add-on icon.

Looks great, I love the default add-on icon.
The problem is this takes both SDK and Fx fixes and it's not straightforward. :-(

Wait, in what scenario would the icon be shown? For example, the icon property for the SDK's button apis are a required property - the code will throw an exception without it.

This is about widgets. Not about the new button code.

Widgets don't have any icons at all. They currently get a label inserted but we want to add an icon.
Per discussion on IRC, Matteo is working on this.
Matteo, how is this going?

So we talked about this yesterday and agreed we should at least land the icons already, seeing as that won't affect current consumers in any way, but makes the rest of this easier, and avoids later conflicts with other icons (e.g. for the sidebar widget)

This is the SDK part. I worked on a separate CSS to test the rule for Firefox, now I have to use the proper m-c file that will comes in another patch.

Irakli, I modified the review, please take another look. I removed the label element, using just the toolbarbutton, plus if the widget's `contentURL` option is an image, it would be use that one during customization instead of the default one.

If you're not convinced by the last improvement, I can rollback and use always the default icon, and makes this change in another release.

Let me know a.s.a.p. so that we can merge and uplift.
I decided to rollback the icon thingy: there are some cases we should take in consideration. Plus, widget is going to be deprecated anyway.

CSS to style the widget during and after customization

Gijs, could you please double check the retina rules? I wasn't able to test them properly. Hope I split the rules in the right files, but let me know about anything. There are a tons of improvements I would love to do about styling widgets in australis, 'cause currently they seems not working well, but we're out of time and definitely those improvements are not in this bug's scope.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Getting there, but I have a bunch of comments and I'd like to see the resulting patch (and be able to test it). For the latter, can you suggest an add-on I can use to actually test this? I just spent 30 minutes trying to get the SDK set up to do this (hello, bug 556562) and using lightbeam, only to find that they apparently switched to the new ui-button stuff already...

We only show the button (and consequently the icon) in the panel and palette, so you can suffice with adding just 1 selector:

widget's example add-on
Gijs, I will address your review's comment; in the meanwhile I attached a simple add-on that you can try. It basically creates a Widget with an icon 16x16 and that's all. Let me know if you need anything else!

CSS to style the widget during and after customization

I addressed the review's comment. I didn't use the `toolbaritem[sdkstylewidget="true"] > toolbarbutton` on first place because I was thinking the scenario where, if the widget as an icon and not a HTML document, we could show that one in the toolbar. However at the end it wasn't worthy, especially because we didn't have time to implement that properly.

This still needs width/height: 32px rules for OS X. I've just gone and added those, fixed the nit below, and then landed this for you. Also, the icon is vertically offset in the panel by a few pixels, but I can't figure out how to fix that (obvious things like adding a few pixels margins don't seem to work), and I think we should just land this as-is:

The other rule about this behaviour is in browser/base, so this one should be, too.
