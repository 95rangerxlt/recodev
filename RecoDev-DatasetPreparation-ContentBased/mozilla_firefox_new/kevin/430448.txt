Eww

The problem is that the bottom toolbar ends up being 32px while the background image is just 31px high.

quick fix

This is a simple fix, shifts the background image to the bottom of the box. This moves the white border to the top but as the background fades it blends in reasonable well. However if the UI font grows then it will still look poor

A bit better

set background color of the area to match the bottom of the background-image

this should be a bit more flexible
