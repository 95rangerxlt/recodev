Notes which are the functions of only windows are not in help.
Since it is confusing, supposing it is possible, except windows, I will think it
good to remove this help writing.

As long as we have no <win> etc. tags set up, we could either add "(Windows
only)" to the docs, or use #ifdef XP_WIN. I'd vote for the latter.

The issue is the TOC. There is no way to restrict RDF entries to a particular
platform. You can't use #ifdef because of localizations, and using <win> doesn't
work in RDF.

The "Read Mail" and "New Message" menuitems are not part of any TOC as far as I
can see.
If it is difficult to divide by #ifdef XP_WIN etc., I will think that it is the
better only by adding with "(Windows Only)."

Also by the help of the Japanese version Windows, description of "PC-AT Only"
and "NEC PC98 Only" is seen.

There is a difference between the Control key and the Command key on the similar
problem.
It is kind if there are notes as follows even if attached to such a difference.
 "In Mac, it becomes the Command key."

I agree.

You can use <span class="mac"> or <span class="noMac"> to separate those command
keys.

They are on this end.

OK, I added that message.


Menu Reference needs to be updated
