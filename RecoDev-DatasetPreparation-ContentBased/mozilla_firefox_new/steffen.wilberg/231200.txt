Bug 224578 made modules/libpref/src/init/all.js application independent. It now
 gets exported to bin/greprefs/all.js. So we can remove all identical prefs from
Firebird's all.js (exported to bin/defaults/pref/).

We should rename Firebird's all.js to firebird.js to avoid confusion, as
suggested in bug 207315 comment 22.

Firebird's all.js overrides the grepfrefs/all.js by the way.

The installer needs to know where to find all.js, security-prefs.js and
xpinstall.js now that they're moved to greprefs.

The all.js, now firebird.js, shrinks down from 30k to 9k.
Also fixes bug 214857. Also relicensing.

You've got to rename mozilla/browser/app/profile/all.js to firebird.js after
applying the patch.
Dup of bug 231170.
*** Bug 231170 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
From bug 224578 comment 21, this is not merely a perf improvement... the
platform-specific overrides are being overridden by the app-level all.js .  This
is mostly my fault, but I would love to see this land soon, to avoid a bunch of
platform-specific firebird bugs.
pref("print.use_native_print_dialog", false); can now be removed as well, see
bug 231298 comment 4.

I'll take care of the rename and checkin.
... though I'd like to see many of these prefs moved out of the master all.js
(things specific to mailnews, for example)
Is there a midas-prefs.js for when Midas is built?  Or were they in editor.js?
I also removed two more prefs that were not needed:

nglayout.widget.mode
nglayout.initialpaint.delay

and checked in the patch.

Can someone ascertain if this caused bug 231338? The *nixian middlemouse prefs
contentLoadURL, paste and scrollbar all seem to have recently been set to false
from their previous state of true.
people, please don't forget to import settings from beos.js too.
and dont forget to include there
settings from already landed patch

as Seamonkey people did:

Sergei, there's no need to do anything on our side because we use
mozilla/modules/libpref/src/init/all.js as well; it gets exported to
bin/greprefs/all.js. So fixing all.js fixed Firebird too.


remove identical prefs from all.js, rename it to firebird.js, fix installer
