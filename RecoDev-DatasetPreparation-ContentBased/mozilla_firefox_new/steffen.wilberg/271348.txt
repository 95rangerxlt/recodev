Our description for Options->Advanced->Accessibility->Move system caret with
focus/selection changes is insufficient. I never bothered to find out what this
is really about, but I just learned that this is the same as the "caret
browsing" mode.

Our explanation is pretty insufficient here.

Mention caret browsing, the moveable cursor, and F7.
Partly taken from the warning dialog, which is displayed when you press F7.

The pref for this is accessibility.browsewithcaret by the way.

>+    Caret Browsing, this specifies whether a moveable cursor is displayed,

Replace "moveable" with "movable".  In my experience it's more often spelled
without the internal 'e', and dictionary.com's definitions supports me in this.

>+    pressing F7.</p>

s/F7/<kbd>F7<\/kbd>/

Also (unless you think I'm totally off-base here), file a bug to have the
description text changed in the preferences window and add me (jwalden+bmo) to
the CC list.  The current text is incredibly poor -- it's stilted and gives no
indication whatsoever that the pref controls caret browsing.  I'm not really
even sure why the pref is there to start, but if it has to be there, its
description text should characterize it better.
Fixed.
Bug 271420 filed.
Clobbered by aviary landing.
Landed again on trunk.


"Move system caret with focus/selection changes" needs to explain that this is the same as caret browsing
