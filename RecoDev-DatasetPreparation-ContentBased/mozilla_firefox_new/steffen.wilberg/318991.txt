1.8 branch patch

The trunk patch doesn't apply cleanly, so here's a branch patch.
I guess about: in Firefox 2 shouldn't link to the Firefox 1.5 release notes, so requesting blocking-firefox2.
*** Bug 287477 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
1.8 branch:
Checking in mozilla/toolkit/content/about.xhtml;
/cvsroot/mozilla/toolkit/content/about.xhtml,v  <--  about.xhtml
new revision: 1.8.8.1; previous revision: 1.8
done

This is a semantic change and busts all builds. Note that not all locales use
URLs that go nicely with this change, too.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla1.8/search?string=releaseURL is the current
state of the l10n tree.

Using something like releaseBaseURL sounds better.
It busts all builds that don't pick up this change. So I'll change the key to releaseBaseURL to force them to do that. Looks like it's a good idea anyway since quite a few still link to 1.0.html.

change the entity to releaseBaseURL

I also added a localization note.

add a 

,e.g. "2.0.html"

to the localization note? And make that __MOZ_APP_VERSION__, if localizers see variable substitution, it should match the pattern.

I'm not sure about sq, could you file a good follow-up bug for http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla1.8/source/sq/browser/chrome/help/firefox_welcome.xhtml#41 ? I don't know what that should look like from a help point of view.
Checked in branch and trunk, with comment addressed.
And as for the sq locale, the bug would be "wake up from hibernation and update your locale from 1.0.6 to 1.5" ;-)

The 1.5 Help welcome page (the one that appears when you press F1) doesn't contain the release notes link anymore. That was bug 277328, checked in 2005-05-05. The current version is this: http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/help/firefox_welcome.xhtml
Or in other words, sq is not affected since I didn't touch the AVIARY_1_0_1_20050124_BRANCH.
Attachment 213089 caused bug 329130.

I attached a patch to fix the issue with about: in a firefox build without branding, but I'm not sure what other uses of releaseURL need to be updated: http://landfill.mozilla.org/mxr-test/mozilla/search?string=releaseURL&regexp=on&find=&filter=releaseURL


brand.dtd shouldn't hardcode the version number in releaseURL

fixed1.8.1
