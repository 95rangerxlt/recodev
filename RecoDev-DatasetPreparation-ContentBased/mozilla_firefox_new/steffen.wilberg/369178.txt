Hi Jeff, I guess it doesn't hurt starting to attack some docs bugs again ;-)

Hm, we don't really explain what we mean by this here.  How about if we add something like:

> forged or "phishing" sites.  Phishing sites pretend to be sites you
> trust to attempt to trick you into submitting private information
> (such as passwords or bank account numbers) to them.

I'm not entirely satisfied with the wording here; if you have a better suggestion, I'm all ears.  Let me know what wording you think makes sense here.

Yeah, we should explain the term web forgery/phishing.

How about this:
  Phishing sites pretend to be sites you trust,
  like your bank or online shopping or auction sites, to trick you into
  submitting sensitive information like your username and password for
  that site or your credit card details to them.

I wonder if we should put that in the glossary instead and add a link to "phishing".

Thunderbird's thread+date-sorting is subpar; the message is positioned based on the location of the previous message in the thread at the time the message was received, and so this didn't filter to the top of my inbox because I hadn't moved the old messages out yet.

This feels a bit wordy and run-ony.  How about changing "like your...details" into "(username/password, credit card information, etc.)"?

I think I like the idea of a glossary entry, but it seems like it's more trouble for the user to click through the link to read the info than to just include it inline as has happened so far.  We could link it for offhand mentions and places where the full sense of the definition aids in understanding but isn't critical, but in this case it seems better to explain and not link (since if you don't understand the term the entire entry's mostly meaningless).

Add "sites" to the end of this paragraph, and s/falsely/incorrectly/.

Indeed, that's confusing. I usually keep the newest email only.
Anyway, you should have received a separate "review requested:" email, which is not hidden in the bug thread...
But 8 days is much better than 3 months ;-)

I have no idea what "run-ony" means. But I like your suggestion better than "like your" twice.

Didn't touch the glossary, and fixed that:

Review requests thread too.  :-)


> I have no idea what "run-ony" means.

Made-up word; a run-on sentence is basically one that consists of two separate sentences not joined correctly (usually with just a comma), or something like that -- I learned enough of grammar that my intuition works, which doesn't mean I remember the exact terms for violations.  In this case it just felt that, as written, we were cramming too many clauses into one sentence, and they were blending together into something that should have been two sentences, just as a run-on should be two sentences.
> Review requests thread too.  :-)
Well, I get two emails for review requested/review granted: the normal "[Bug xxxxxx]" bugmail, and a separate "review requested: [Bug xxxxxx]" mail. The latter is not in the normal bug thread, since it has a different subject. Maybe you have switched those off?

Ah, ok. Well, it not like someone forgot to insert a full-stop: "Phishing sites pretend to be ..., like ..., in order to trick you into submitting ..."
Of course, it could be split into two sentences: "They try to trick you into submitting..."

No, I hadn't deled the original review request, and the new request was being threaded underneath that; it was the same for the actual bugmails as well.  Both new emails were way up the folder.

Yeah, I was trying hard to avoid that.
Checked in.
