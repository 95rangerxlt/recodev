Branch checkin, including renaming the "Allowed Sites" button to "Exceptions":

The checkbox now controls the "xpinstall.whitelist.required" instead of the
"xpinstall.enabled" pref. With the whitelist enabled, you get the yellow info
bar. With the whitelist disabled, sites can annoy you with unwanted install
prompts, and gives malicious sites an opportunity to badger you into clicking OK
(from bug 288054 comment 54).

patch

r=me with the removal of the comma after "tries to install an extension" (it's
a comma splice otherwise).
A little birdie who shall go unnamed but whose IRC nick starts with "Ma" and
ends with "no" informs me that this bit of UI will change after beta to
something else.  The little birdie places the blame for this on a person who
shall go nameless but whose IRC nick starts with "dv" and ends with "editz".

Consequently, it looks like this probably should wait on checkin at least until
we're certain they're done messing with it, and if they actually do manage whack
at it a few more times we might need an entirely new patch.

Aren't random UI changes fun?
I checked this in since the discussed changes in bug 310737 are likely to keep
the UI for the xpinstall.whitelist.required pref so we need most of this anyway,
because this is correct right now, and because the tree is about to close for 1.8b5.

Nothing to change from bug 310737.


"Allow web sites to install software" has been changed to "Warn me when web sites try to install extensions or themes"
