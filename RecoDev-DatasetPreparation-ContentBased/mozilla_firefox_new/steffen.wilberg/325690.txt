The change from Shift+Del to Del works well enough so that I expect it to stay.
This patch fixes bug 325966 as well, and that's the part I need another careful pair of eyes on.
Note that 325737 might revert to the old behavior for Macs. Should I reopen this or file a new help bug if that happens?
Lol! I guess we can reuse this one.
Let us please not forget to add mention of this means for deleting single entries to the dialog: Tools > Options > Privacy > Saved forms. That dialog provides means of deleting /all/ elements, and should also explain how to delete /single/ elements.
I tried replacing the text as shown in Firefox 1.5 on Mac OS X, but it doesn't appear to be working. I assume the text goes in Firefox/MacOS/chrome/en-US.jar? 

When I replace the text, the toolbars don't appear and I get this error:
<window id="main-window"
^    <menuitem id="menu_HelpPopup_reportertoolmenu" 
----^        <command id="minimizeWindow"
--------^
I just landed the patch in bug 325737, which changes it back to Shift+Del for Mac.

Looks good to me; it's a pity Macs have to be different on this shortcut.  :-\

Now that classes and finals are done, I'm slowly working my way through latent bugmail, newsgroups, and other tasks.  I should have a bit more time to deal with these things over the next few months, and I'm at least tentatively planning to take sets of less demanding courses in future semesters (although this might not always happen depending on exactly which classes I want to take, when they're offered, and the number of remaining semesters in which to take them).
Checked in trunk & branch.
wonder if there is any chance this could be related to the problems we see in the latest minimo builds with [del] key actions on the softkeyboard

This is a Help Documentation bug, so I doubt it ;).
From the range in that bug, it looks like bug 339661 is the likely culprit.


Change "delete autocomplete entry" to Del on non-mac platforms
