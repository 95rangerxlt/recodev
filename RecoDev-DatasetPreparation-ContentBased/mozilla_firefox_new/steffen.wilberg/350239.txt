I started with using chrome images for the portrait and landscape icons and the arrow icons, but then I read through it and discovered some bugs: The searchbar has changed its UI a bit, and the prefwindow changes seem to strike everywhere.

Using the chrome images has the advantage that they don't get out of date as long as their paths don't change. I'll post on the themes forum on mozillazine that theme authors shouldn't change the name of these images if we take this.

The location and searchbar images are the only remote images left.

"You can install new search engines by clicking the <em>Get more search engines...</em> link."?  This localized URL formatting thing is getting annoying...

Ugh.  Is "Searching for Selected Words on the Web" any better?

This probably needs updating if we change the previous wording.

Space in between "</em>" and "<img" -- looking at the current spacing (and assuming it doesn't change much with chrome images) Portrait survives, but Landscape doesn't have the padding to pull it off.

We're recommending cache sizes???  Good grief.  I'm trying to think of a way to recommend a reasonable number without too much explanation of why the number's good but am failing; why don't we just remove it?


Anyway, this is fine, but I'd like to try to come up with something better than "Searching the Web for Selected Words in a Web Page" before we check it in.

Fixed. Yeah, we need to find a solution for that.

Hmm, that sounds like some very special and carefully selected words are
somewhere on the web because it doesn't refer to the current page.
How about "Searching the Web for Words selected in a Web Page"?

Not with this suggestion.

Because the "power-user" might change it and then don't know what's a sane size?
How about stating the default size (50MB)?

Here you are, but someone needs to check this in because I'm away for the next two weeks.

That works with capitalization of "selected" (in checked-in patch); I also had to modify the toc file for this.

Default size is reasonable and has some precedent ("restore to default" for home page), so that looks good.  I switched "50MB is the default size" to "The default size is 50MB" for some gut aesthetic feelings I can't rationalize well, tho.

Done.

This corrects some issues with help documentation related to the new preferences window, and we really want accurate docs.

OK, thanks. And greetings from Turkey ;-)
In on branch.  Note to localizers to be posted in m.d.l10n shortly...
I just posted on the mozillazine themes forum as promised in comment 1.

Thanks for the post to the themes forum.  For the benefit of theme developers who aren't familiar with using_firebird.xhtml, could you please also say where this file is used in the Firefox UI and what actions to perform to bring it up.

This page http://kb.mozillazine.org/Chrome_URLs lists chrome://help/locale/using_firebird.xhtml, but that doesn't (directly at least) display any content in eithe Fx1.5 or 2.0.


OK, I see this must be one of the pages displayed in the help window.


clean up the Using Firefox document (use chrome images, adjust to new searchbar UI, prefwindow changes)
