The preference ui displays

Automatically check for updates to:
[X] Firefox
[X] Add-ons
[X] Search Engines

When updates to Firefox are found:
O Ask me what I want to do
0 Automatically download and install update
  [X] Warn me if this update will disable any of my add-ons


If someone doesn't want updates to be automatically downloaded they might just read the first couple of items on the page and not notice there are other options since they are several lines further down in the ui and instead choose to disable update checks completely.

I don't necessarily like the ui Windows has for these settings but I do think the order of choices is better than what we have.

Firefox has:
1. enable (with individual settings further down the page) or disable entirely
2. N/A for app update
3. N/A for app update
4. individual settings mentioned previously

Windows has:
1. Install updates automatically (recommended)
2. Download update but let me choose whether to install them
3. Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them
4. Never check for updates (not recommended)

Rather late in the game but people disabling app update checks is a "bad thing" so requesting blocking to see if we can't get a better ui for Firefox 4.0
This is another one that hurts, but I don't think we can block on this. I don't think it's affecting a significant number of our users.

Good prefs polish to get if/when we re-write the entire dialog, though. Something akin to comment 0 is what we want, which gives clearer options.
If we want to just quickly invert the two sections, so "When update to Firefox are found:" appears first, that's fine.  Otherwise we'll clean this up later when we refactor all of the options.

Yeah, this would be a quick fix, just switch the order of the two sections.
Taking.

Should we support case #2 (download but not install) at all?
#1 would be app.update.enabled and app.update.auto set to true (default values).
#3 would be app.update.enabled == true and app.update.auto == false.
#4 would be app.update.enabled == false and app.update.auto == false.

What about the rest of the current options:
  Automatically check for updates to:
  [X] Add-ons
  [X] Search Engines
Check for those updates in case #1 and #3, and don't check in #4?
In comment #0 I wasn't stating that we should have the exact same options as Windows. It was only an example for UX.

In 'Check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them', should there not be a 'Warn me if this will disable any of my add-ons' checkbox?

Also it would be handy if you threw in a 'Check for updates, and say Firefox is up to date even if it has failed to reach the update server' checkbox. Bug 648967

There shouldn't though it would be fine to inform the user that when manually choosing whether to download you will always be informed if there are incompatible add-ons.

That should not be a preference and is already covered by Bug 648967. Please don't try to get your bugs fixed in other bugs

yeah this is clearer than what we currently have, sorry about the delay.

small nit, mentioning if the update is downloaded seems kind of peripheral to the overall choice, and increases the complexity (one would assume that an update must be downloaded before it is installed).

Also it seems like we should mention why we are making our recommendations.  

How about:

(*) Automatically install updates (recommended: improved security)
     [x] warm me if this will disable nay of my add-ons
( ) Check for updates, but let me choose whether to install them
( ) Never check for updates (not recommend: security risk)

Robert, could you review this, please? Your queue is much shorter than Gavin's, and you reported the bug...
Oops, patch v1.2 and 1.3 are identical.
Will update updateCheck.label per bug 600500 comment 14 in the next iteration.
Comment on attachment 555843
patch v1.3

Took a quick look and see that you have changed the updateHistory.accesskey entity value without changing the name. Locales like en-GB at the very least need to see this change. Please keep updateHistory.label in sync with the entity name change when you fix the above. Please verify this isn't the case else where as well.

The following text seems rather awkward:
Automatically check for &brandShortName; updates:
   Automatically install updates (recommended: improved security)

I think it would read better as
&brandShortName; updates:
   Automatically install updates (recommended: improved security)

Please run that suggested text by faaborg and if he doesn't agree that's fine.

minusing mainly due to the entity name not being changed and to check with faaborg regarding the text.

I agree that this reads better too. Just in case you need an opinion from the UX team and Faaborg is busy. :)

patch v1.4

1. Dropped the unnecessary change of updateHistory.accesskey.
2. Bumped enableAddonsUpdate2.label and .accesskey to 3 because I have to change the accesskey. Other entities are either new or unchanged.
3. Used "&brandShortName; updates:" as suggested by comment 20.
4. Renamed the second heading from "Automatically check for updates to" (Add-ons, Search Engines) to "Automatically update:" to make it fit better, and more precise (it not only checks, but also updates silently).
5. Wrapped the two sections into proper groupboxes like almost everywhere else in the pref window, and removed the separators.

Sadly there's no border around the groupboxes on Linux, but the captions are bold, and the contents are indented.

Had to remove the align="start" attribute of the tabpanel element to make the width of the groupboxes extend to the width of the tabpanel. The other tabpanels don't have this attribute either.

The Windows screenshot looks very good.  But, shouldn't the line that says "not recommend: security risk" actually say "not recommended: security risk"?  It would flow better with the line above that says "recommended: improved security".

Steffen, patch looks good but before I r+ this I am going to run through the different configurations to verify everything works as expected. I will hopefully have this reviewed by tonight but it may be a day or so. Thanks
Sure, take all the time you need, and thanks for the update.
Note that I (re-)landed this on the UX branch, so there are plenty of "-ux" nightlies to test.

Things not to tell your reviewer:

I promise, I'm close to being done though I was close last week as well. ;)
Comment on attachment 564662
patch v1.6

Looks good and everything worked as expected with a disable updater build. It might be a good thing to have finer control over what controls are disabled when locking prefs now that there is an additional control but I'm not too worried about that and think we should wait to see if providing that would be of any value.

Would seem the comment 16 attachment didn't include the wording change that the attachment comment mentioned.
Indeed. Please file a followup-bug if you think that needs to be changed.
