They trigger the popdown containing installed engines.  I don't know when the shortcuts were implemented, but it looks like they were fixed to work in bug 337720 a week and a half ago.

There's a part of me that wants to remove the Ctrl+Up/Down shortcuts from docs since the performed action is significantly less intuitive (the user has to rememeber the order of the installed engines) and replace them with the shortcuts this bug requests.  (There's also a part of me that wants to request Ctrl+Up/Down be *completely* removed, but I'm less sure this .)  Thoughts?

These shortcuts were originally implemented in bug 283273 for Firefox 1.5. For some reason I thought they were already documented... maybe I'm thinking of something else.
Yeah, let's just s/Accel+Up Arrow/Alt+Up Arrow/ and the same for Down Arrow.

Nice to see a sign of life from you again, Jeff. I hope you've got a bit more time now since I've got patches waiting in bug 325690 and bug 335779, and more work to do for Firefox 2.
