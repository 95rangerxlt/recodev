We're seeing a crash on launch for April 25th nightly. The stack is produced by the nightly doesn't make sense, but the code that's crashing is in Growl. Mossop showed me a stack that made more sense and I was able to track down the problem. I traced it down due to the following console log before the crash:

2007-04-25 19:52:29.496 firefox-bin[2113] *** -[NSURL dockDescription]: selector not recognized [self = 0x1a2b5d0]
2007-04-25 19:52:29.496 firefox-bin[2113] An uncaught exception was raised
2007-04-25 19:52:29.496 firefox-bin[2113] *** -[NSURL dockDescription]: selector not recognized [self = 0x1a2b5d0]
2007-04-25 19:52:29.496 firefox-bin[2113] *** Uncaught exception: <NSInvalidArgumentException> *** -[NSURL dockDescription]: selector not recognized [self = 0x1a2b5d0]

It's trying to use a method added via a category to NSURL in the file NSURLAdditions.m, but at runtime that method is not showing up. It seems most likely that something is happening during the build process that's preventing this file and/or it symbols from getting built in.

The thing is I'm seeing other growl symbols in nm and strings, but not the ones from NSURLAdditions.m. I'm unable to tell if it's a file level or class level problem, because there aren't any symbols or strings in that file that arne't part of the NSURL category. It's all very very strange.

I didn't see this on an incremental build with --enable-debug and --disable-optimized, but Mossop is seeing it in his static optimized Non-UB build.

This is a problem with building statically.
Also, there's no crash if Growl isn't installed, which is why it didn't turn the tree red.
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-ObjC" doesn't help.  Looks like we need to figure out how to make this always build a dylib.

Seems to work statically for me.  This is a dylib for the component, and a dylib for the growl code.
This works for me. Previously my builds would crash on startup, with this it runs fine and I even get a growl notification from completed downloads.

Dynamic component code, static growl code as per bsmedberg's request.

nit: use spaces not tabs

Because we never link this library dynamically (as a .dylib), we shouldn't need any of these LDFLAGS or EXTRA_DSO_LDOPTS. Please remove them unless they are needed for reasons I can't think of.

This seems to have broken XULRunner on Mac, per http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=XULRunner/1177957080.21819.gz

Not much different from last patch.  Now just using TOOL_DIRS when building alerts on the mac to fix XULRunner bustage.
