If Shumway's playerglobal is used for compilation, the compiler fails due to wrong signature of the allowDomain method, e.g.:

[Compiler] Error #1137: Incorrect number of arguments.  Expected no more than 0.
   ExtInt2.as, Ln 20, Col 28: 
         Security.allowDomain('*');
   ...........................^

(Workaround is to use Security.allowDomain.call(null, '*');)
