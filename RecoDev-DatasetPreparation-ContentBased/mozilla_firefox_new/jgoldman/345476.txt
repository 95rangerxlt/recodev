The notifyBadges.png at times will be displayed by each other. Having the yellow one with a black exclamation point looks funky when the others all have a white one.

The last image in viewButtons.png is for installation of all add-ons and is using the same image as is used for extensions. Since they will be displayed at the same time it isn't appropriate to use the same image.
another note... the xpinstall image (e.g. the one on the left of viewButtons.png) has an obvious change in color near the middle from top to bottom and it should blend more.
Also, the image should probably be the same as the xpinstallItemGeneric.png

Pinstripe image replacements v2

Thanks for the feedback Robert!

Replaces the previous version of the images for Pinstripe, including two changes:

1) All of the notifyBadges are now white !s

2) The "Install" icon is now a native install icon for the host OS.

Winstripe replacement to follow...
