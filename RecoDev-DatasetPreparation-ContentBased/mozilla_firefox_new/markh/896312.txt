896312-empty-cookie-array.patch

Simple patch.  Facebook continues to work fine with the patch, and I doubt anyone else relies on the buggy behaviour.

Along with a test for the no-cookies case, I also changed the existing test to use 2 cookies instead of 1 just to better check the login in the cookie-get message - that test worked fine.
