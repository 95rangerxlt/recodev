0002-Bug-XXXXXXX-Allow-DeviceActor-to-work-when-no-browse.patch

The DeviceActor has code:

    let win = Services.wm.getMostRecentWindow(DebuggerServer.chromeWindowType);

that fails to work correctly when |win| is null - as it will be for xpcshell tests.

The following attachment makes it skip those attributes which are derived from such a window.  With this patch, WebIDE connects to the xpcshell tests.
