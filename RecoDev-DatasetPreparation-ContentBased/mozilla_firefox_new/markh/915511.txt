This patch causes getWindowValue to return an empty string if the session store is disabled for e10s.

In keeping the same pattern as this property is used elsewhere, add this check at the beginning of the function
Thanks!  Moved the check.

What exactly makes getWindowValue() fail in a multi-process browser? What is the STR of the issue here?

I don't really like having _disabledForMultiProcess sprinkled everywhere and it seems like we shouldn't need to do this for per-window values, no?

(Also, a little note would have been appreciated before adding stuff to SessionStore, we're working hard on rewriting quite a lot of it right now :)
Sorry Tim, I totally forgot this was being worked on at the moment - I should have asked you for review.

The STR is to enable e10s - but sadly the exception is swallowed (have I mentioned my thoughts on promises recently ;)  As this is at the very end of the delayed startup code, the impact isn't obvious - but it causes tests to fail to start as line 1303 of browser.js is never reached.

Basically, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#1301 fails - browser-tabview ends up calling getWindowValue().  I figured that as SessionStore already has workarounds for e10s it was probably better than catching the exception higher and rethrowing.

I'm happy to adjust this as you request.
