They are silently installed - at a minimum they should only be installed after a scary warning.

self-signed certs are another interesting case, but maybe that is different enough it should be in a new bug (or just allowed?)

This is tested in browser_registry.js and currently marked as a "known failure".

My suggestion for now is to silently reject any manifest on a domain where the cert fails, include a bypass with the social.provider.devmode preference so we can test with our presumably self-signed mochitest server.  We should then revisit this to see if it is worth having UX to deal with this.

mcoates: what do you think?

Check the SSL status of the manifest host

A patch that makes the tests work.  The mochi server seems to have a real cert (or manages to pretend it does) so the devmode pref doesn't seem necessary at the moment.

still would like to be able to pref this off for development
Fixed in git as [develop a3a0bcc]


providers from origins with invalid, expired or missing certificates still get installed.
