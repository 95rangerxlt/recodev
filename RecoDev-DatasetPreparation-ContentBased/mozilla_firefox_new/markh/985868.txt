On a machine without network access I repeatedly get a notification
about failing to sync.

The popup-at-the-bottom message reminding you to fix your sync setup
disappears when you click the X, but reappears after roughly 10
seconds:

“Sync has not been able to complete during the last 14 days.  Please
check your network settings.”

Whilst this message is annoying in the first place (yes, I know I'm
offline) making it not appear again for the duration of the user's
session seems a reasonable fix.

I've some thoughts around this, but would like to get some more context first.

* You say the machine is offline; is "work offline" selected, or is the problem simply that it's not been connected to a network for this period?

* Do you use this machine regularly?  ie, over the last 14 days, has it been used (roughly) daily?  Or has it only been used for a few of those 14 days?

* Do you expect this machine to come back online soon?  I guess I'm asking why sync is setup on this machine in the first place?  Or to put it another way, at what point do you consider it would be OK to start reporting there has been a prolonged interval without a sync succeeding for this machine?  Never? After a month?  (Note that this assumes you haven't explicitly set "work offline" - clearly in that case we shouldn't be complaining)

(Note I'm not challenging the premise - I'm trying to formulate some ideas for how to avoid anything annoying while also not leaving the user with the impression Sync is silently doing its thing when it isn't, and hasn't been for quite some time)

Work offline isn't selected.  This was a case of a laptop without internet
connectivity for a short period of time.

The machine is used occasionally, probably not a great deal over the past 14
days.  Should I be suspecting that I have an outdated nightly on it and upgrade
to see if the problem persists?

The machine comes online at home or in the office, so sync is needed.

Okay, so the context is that I leave home with the laptop, open it at the
train station whilst waiting for the train where there's no connectivity, then
plugging it in again when I reach the office.
Thanks for the helpful update:

Nope - I was just trying to get some insight into how this machine is used.  Current nightlies will have the same behaviour.

I'm going to keep this bug as simply "don't warn multiple times in the same session" and I opened bug 990809 for us to tweak the algorithm that decides when to initially show it.

0001-Bug-985868-only-report-prolonged-sync-errors-once-pe.patch

This patch arranges for sync's errorHandler to only report a prolonged error once per application run.  The logic is in sync rather than in the Fx UI code as that UI code is per-window, so keeping a global flag is somewhat trickier.
An additional piece of historical context: part of the reason for warning in this circumstance *does* apply to this scenario.

It's trying to clue the user in to the fact that -- as the message says -- this machine isn't up to date, because Firefox hasn't been able to sync.

If you don't realize that you clicked "Work Offline" a while ago, for example, that's actually valuable information. Sync doesn't have any other UI channel to convey passive information, so instead it displays a (hostile, non-actionable) error.
