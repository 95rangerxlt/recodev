Actually, this applies to all counter links within the page, not just the top.
It works in 3.5. I think this is a problem with Minefield because I'm using jQuery, which most likely isn't tested in Minefield.
The problem was with a change in the mozIStorageStatement API, but it's fixed now. about:me will still work with 3.5, but now will also work with minefield.
Any idea what patch may have fixed it?
