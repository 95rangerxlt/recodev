Conflicting Progress Screenshot

The new URL progress bar moves LTR when in RTL mode while background tab progress moves RTL.

STR:
- Put browser in RTL mode
- Navigate or refresh a page
- Watch progress go LTR
- Refresh a background tab
- Watch progress go RTL

Expected:
- All progress bars should move RTL

I feel stupid now, but how can i put the browser into right to left mode? Or is this a Mac only feature? (I'm on Win)

Note: I tried on en-US Minefield, and hu-HU Fx 3.6.10, too. Not worked with any version.

This fixes the problem.

As a side note, the progress meter in the status bar also moved LTR in RTL mode. Was that a bug, or was that intentional?

Sounds like a bug, but I don't really know.

This is fine code-wise, but I don't know what the expected behavior for progress bars is.

That was a bug.
This is not blocking yet, so you should request approval2.0 on the patch./
This is now blocking beta 7, neener-neener.
I'll land it if the tree is ever green.
