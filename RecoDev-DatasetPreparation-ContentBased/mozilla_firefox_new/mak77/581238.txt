Bug 574511 made the "bookmarks button" customizable, but its tendency to move around makes it continue to seem like it cannot be removed.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Make a new Firefox profile (mkdir tp; firefox -profile tp)
2. Notice that the bookmarks toolbar has a "Bookmarks ▾" at the right.
3. Go into "Customize toolbars" mode.
4. Notice that "Bookmarks ▾" is gone; the entire bookmarks toolbar has turned into "Bookmarks Toolbar Items".

To actually remove it, you have to realize that the very different-looking "Star" button, which appears on a *different* toolbar, is actually the one you want to remove while in customize-toolbars mode.  If I hadn't seen bug 574511 in the list of recent checkins, I would not have figured this out.

well, when you open customize the button moves, and it has the same icon.
The alternative would be to hide it and then you would be really unable to remove it.
notice we don't allow users to remove the button, but its container, and the button moves from that container (That can be re-positioned) to the bookmarks (wherever they are) if they are visible.
> well, when you open customize the button moves

So don't do that?  It's really confusing.
What button moves where? Both Bookmarks Button and Star Button stays on their place when I open Cuztomize window. (And I'm not sure what do you mean in the description.)

it happens only if bookmarks toolbar is visible

There is not any not-hackish way to do that. I mean, the natural position of the button is on navigationbar, when we move to the bookmarks (notice it is not moved to bookmarks toolbar, but to bookmarks inside bookmarks toolbar) it is in a special position used to better use the space (and I've read nice feedback about this also in various articles about FX4b1). So when you enter customize it would disappear with bookmarks, thus I moved it to the natural position to allow user to remove it.
The only way I could think of is to add a fake movable button when customize starts and on customize change put the container there. I can try but it's an hack clearly and I'm unsure it would be approved.
so how, pray tell, do i remove the bookmarks menu item tacked on to the right side of the bookmarks bar? I've managed to get the bookmarks menu to show on the left, but i still have that tacky google chrome-ish bookmarks item on the right.
While this behavior is not ideal, this does not block the final release of Firefox.

just remove the bookmarks button from the toolbars wherever it is and put it in the buttons palette.
unfortunately the first 3 or 12 times i tried that it didn't work, but after x number of attempts it did allow me to put it where i wanted. sigh
what do you mean by "it did not work" and where di you put it?
i removed the bookmarks toolbar item from the bar, placed it inside the customize box, then tried placing it back on the toolbar. the first two or three times the only thing i was able to put back was the bookmarks toolbar item, with bookmarks menu attached. finally, oafter a few attempts bookmarks toolbar item and the bookmarks menu showed up as seperate items, at which point i was able to place both on the toolbar as i liked.

transferring blocking from the dupe.
btw, if we want to retain the wise "move to bookmarks" behavior, fixing this could be tricky. The button is not an entity of bookmarks toolbar, is part of Bookmarks Toolbar Items, because we want it to follow bookmarks wherever the user puts them. We should put in a number of hacks to make the above happen since then the button would have a behavior when the user did not move it out of bookmarks and another one when he did move it out of bookmarks. would become mostly uinpredictable.
Also it will be nice when new bookmark button will occupies less space and will be only button without name (like you selected in "Customize...")
For at least it looks like this in mockups and I like it in that way

Home button have the same problem on bookmarks bar
This bug does not appear for me for both a clean profile and my month-old profile.

Anyone else?

RESOLVED WORKSFORME?
it does happen, it must happen since it is by design (itf it does not it's a regression), fixing this one requires a design change.
Still happens for me (if I enable the bookmarks toolbar after step 1).
Brand new install.  FF4.0b7.  

Removing "Bookmarks" from Toolbar into "Customize" works for current window or browser session only. It then reappears.

Aside from the redundancy of it all,(the word and function "Bookmarks" in 2 places) a procedure to change something in this manner should be a toggle - done or undone with no further toggles being performed "automatically".

This now appears to be fixed as of:

Thanks!
I still get this on

This is the behavior we want for Firefox 4 at this point, because the risk of doing something different is very high.

So this will be WONTFIX ? Seems a big odd...

Only for Firefox 4.

So in the future releases like Firefox 4.X or 5 it can be fix as I understand correctly, yep ?

Not 4.x, but the next major release, yes.

What's the status on this ? Because it was planed for next major release and 12th deadline is approaching fast ;p
Will it make it in Firefox 5?
Any chance this can make into Firefox 6?
Branching is in a week.

Given that there is no patch here, that is unlikely.
*** Bug 583749 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
what's the point on asking tracking on something that is not a regression in that specific version nor is a fix that should be observed by release drivers?

FYI tracking is not intended as a replacement for wanted or blocking.
It's marked as wanted in places, so maybe devs should track this if they forget about bugs and not even marking some distant target milestone for fixing it in near future ;)

There is an add-on called bug582139 that fixes the design bug that overrides the user's wishes by moving the bookmarks button to the bookmarks toolbar.
Yeah, moving the bookmarks toolbar button is something that we (the UX team) thought was a good idea at the time but later realized was a bad idea.

I'll take this.
nothing should happen here, bug 748894 is on its way, please don't work on this.
Perhaps this should be duped over to bug 748894, since that will fix this bug?
Oh, I didn't realize that. Thanks.

No, it's a separate issue that can be tracked separately. When Marco fixes bug 748894, if his fix also fixes this bug, he'll get to close two bugs as FIXED and assigned to him, and that's fine. :)
fixed by bug 748894, the button has no more magic, just move it where you want it.
Verified as fixed based on fixing bug 748894.


Bookmarks button changes moves and changes form in Customize Toolbars mode (depending on Bookmarks toolbar and menu bar)
