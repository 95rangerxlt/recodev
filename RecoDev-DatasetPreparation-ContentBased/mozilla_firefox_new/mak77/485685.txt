browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/places/places.properties has entities that doesn't seem to be used anywhere:

Examples:
1) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=deleteDomainNoSelection&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
2) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=deleteHost&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
3) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=bookmarksMenuName&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
4) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=lessCriteria.label&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central


etc.

I'd like to get Dietrich's opinion first since there may be some hidden magic happening that makes them useful and impossible to find :)

Looking at http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/places/places.properties&rev=1.40, some of these are probably just dead.

Similar thing happens in places.dtd:

1) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=feed.subscribe.label&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
2) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=backCmd.label&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
3) http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=moreCriteria.label&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
