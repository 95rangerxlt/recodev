+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #592990 +++

Bug 776416 regressed bug 592990, AFAICT. Clearing private data now blows away all of the about:home/about:newtab data.

The right solution at this point is to stop using localStorage for these pages (newtab will be fixed by bug 791447, and about:home is bug 791447). But it's rather shitty that we're going to likely ship 18 with this bug affecting about:home :(

sucks, but thanks to bug 749477 (that luckily is going to ship in 18 as well!)  the only information wiped from about:home are cached snippets... and luckily we can re-download them!
Yep, just remembered your bug 791447 comment 7 - that's good.

Also, Private Browsing doesn't affect newtab, because it uses getLocalStorageForPrincipal without aPrivate=true, so it commits its changes to disk even in PB mode.
This can't happen anymore, since we don't use anymore DOM Storage. So the bug as-is is fixed.
On the other side any indexedDB data set by about pages will be cleared when clearing offline data. I don't think that's an issue for now though, about:home can handle such situation and it's the only consumer so far.


about:home/about:newtab DOM storage is cleared with cookies and private browsing
