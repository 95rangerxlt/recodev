- June
- May
- April
- March
- Feb.
- Older than 6 months
Within Older than 6 months, January is trimmed, just like the other 5 months (February, March...).

As far as I can tell, there is no way to show the month January with all its entries.

I put my places.sqlite in a VM and changed the month from the machine to August.
The history manager trims February now. Days 1-4 are shown with all entries
and from day 5 onwards the trimming starts. Day 5 is summarized with
13 out of 340 entries (2009-07-05).
This is incremental of course, today day 6 is shown completely, day 7 is trimmed.

Reproducible: Always




Is there a way to show all history entries? There is no easy way to know how many entries there are in total.

sorry, i don't get what do you mean by "trimmed". Can you make a better example?
Sorry and sure.

so, the problem is that some entry is missing...
there must be a reason in the database if those are missing, could even be the bug was in 3.0.11
could you check if by chance those missing entries are in the last month container before "older than 6 months"?
could be where we create older than 6 months instead of using 'start of day' we should use 'start of month', in such a case could be we lose some day depending on which day is today in the month. that could explain the behavior.

patch v1.0

i'll create a trybuild with this patch, you should be able to download it and try if the bug is fixed with this. that way we will be able to confirm and fix it.
builds are compiling, i'll post a link to download here when they will be available.
Ah, great. Thanks for taking the time.
Good I refreshed before posting xD.
builds are here... please make a backup copy of your profile before using these because they are based on minefield, not on 3.5.
https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/mak77@bonardo.net-try-52ea2319ad47/
even if i think these builds won't fix the issue due to the fact they cut one month too early... i'm actually building a unit test on a new patch

patch v1.1

Newer patch, please wait before testing builds, i'm generating new ones.
>> 2009-07-09 11:00:57 PDT
You were right. Problem persists.

Also searching (CTRL+F) the Library, one gets always thrown to the Bookmarks tab (within the Library).
You always have to press ALT+H. Is this intented, for whatever reason?
http://img.imagedash.com/lqxB.png
it depends where do you search. if you search in a bookmarks folder, search will default to bookmarks. if you search an history container, search should default to history.
new builds should appear here in less than one hour from now:

^> ok thanks a lot.

>> if you search an history container, search should
>> default to history.
Well, it doesn't.
win: CTRL+SHIFT+H, CTRL+F, [term], and then I have to press ALT+H.

Aha ok. Been to Litmus.
https://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=7529
It does work. Partially.
If CTRL+F is pressed it doesn't work correctly.

i won't be able to push this, since actually the tree is orange, if someone could do that for me, would be great! Thanks.

patch v1.2

I was lucky to retest this patch today, being today 29 i catched a bug involving February that has only 28 days (usually)...
So this fixes test failure with this patch, and at the same time fixes bug 501439... Both with unit tests.
Changes are quite trivial, so not asking a further review.
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/495598fd5bb5
Marco. This hasn't been fixed.
I realized that couple of months (weeks) ago, but I forgot to "investigate".
So now I was at #firefox to delete my history (with sqlite manager), because I wanted to send the profile and what I didn't know up until now was that by right-clicking 'Older than 6 months' (or any other) it deletes the respective month very fast.
Faster than by selecting the entries...
I made this screenie for #firefox but here
http://i36.tinypic.com/155s6dz.jpg
The first three spikes are from right-clicking the tree item the longer one is from a selection of only 1167 entries versus 50490. Go figure.

So... I deleted the 'older..' item and I ended up with 3542 entries for the month May. The next month in the tree view is June. So May is the seventh month.
If you need dates, for whatever reason, just ask.
file a new bug please, an issue has been fixed in this bug, if there's another one it should be filed apart.
Sorry. The first part was just babbling on my part.
But no, it is not fixed. I am telling that, if you delete the entry not everything gets deleted.
I have filed the bug with the problem being that you can't see all entries of May in 'Older than 6 months', but either way, it still persists.
you should still file a new bug with new steps to reproduce the problem you see related to deleting entries please. This bug was not about deleting entries, and has fixed a real issue that was present and real, and is now covered by an automated test. If the issues are/were 2, they should be in separate bugs.
Ummm Marco. Here have a look.

I have filed a new one as you have seen already, I guess. well w/e.

What is the bug number?  Have you added :mak77 to the CC list?
Ok. Now. Sorry for this, apparently, confusion.
This bug ^ 502860. As far as I am concerned hasn't been solved. Why I wrote

I don't know. But it must have been solved otherwise I wouldn't have written it or I was mistaken.

Kurt the screenie from above is concerning this bug.
The new one is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=529419
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
