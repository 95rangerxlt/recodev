it's likely this code needs to be updated to properly pass the document.
I'm taking this just to have it on the radar, if you want to make a patch feel free to take it.
so, this was already not working (since it's trying to use saveURL but the sidebar doesn't have contentAreaUtils) and it is still not working (now throws), likely not worth to track, considered it's also enabled through a non-default pref.
the original bug about "saveURL not defined" is bug 451658
Created attachment 691961
patch v1.0

and I think this is the proper patch to fix both bugs, just ignore alt. alt+click was intended for content links, not for chrome.
