patch v1.0

for better usage of notifications.

i'm already cleaning up _smartBookmarks and _prefs since they are randomly failing and i hope to make them consistent.
This handles the other tests, that are working but could be better.

why don't you need to send the notification here anymore?
because initing any Places service enqueues the notification, when we later call do_timeout the enqueued notification will be served, so no reason to force it.
