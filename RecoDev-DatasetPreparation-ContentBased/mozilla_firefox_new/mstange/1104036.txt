Expected results: text is selected
Actual results: the window moves with the mouse.

Still reproducible with latest Nightly (build ID: 20150105030202) on Mac OS X 10.9.5 and 'intl.uidirection.en' pref set to 'rtl'.

Could this have been caused by bug 944836?
Yes.
Bug 944836 is in 35, this seems like a bad regression for RTL users.
Is it possible to do a backout of bug 944836 if there was a dot release for 35?  If that was low-risk, we could consider this as a ride-along and save RLT users from many weeks of this behaviour.

Yes, I'll prepare a backout patch and request approval. Bug 1122942 (not being able to drag the window when a non-default theme is used) is another regression that bug 944836 caused, and which the backout would fix.

back out bug 944836

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
bug 944836

[User impact if declined]:
selecting text in the URL bar moves the window for RTL users + users of custom themes can't drag the window until the themes are updated (bug 1122942)

[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
not much, mostly manual testing

[Risks and why]: hopefully fairly low - there were no problems reverting the patches, this backout also removes the changes that were made on top of bug 944836 (namely, bug 1070038 and bug 1072391, both regression fixes).

[String/UUID change made/needed]: none. I'm leaving the nsIWidget change that we've already shipped in, it just becomes a no-op method.


I'll be testing this as thoroughly as I can over the next hour. I've also started a complete try run at https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=83a9962e4390 .
I've done extensive testing now and can confirm that the backout fixes all reported regressions. I haven't found any other problems.
Markus, do you have plans for 36 ? Thanks
I'm going to try my hand at fixing this bug today, and if I fail or the fix ends up looking too risky, I'm going to prepare a backout patch for 36 as well.
ok, thanks for the super fast answer. I am going to track it for 37 & 38 just in case :)

patch

In RTL mode, the urlbar <textbox> has a scaleX(-1) transform applied to it, so we ignore the -moz-window-dragging:drag set on it.
roc, sorry about the ping but we would like to take this patch in 35.0.1. Thanks
Sorry, I made a confusion in comment #13.

[User impact if declined]: Users of right-to-left language Firefox builds can't select text in the address bar

The other patch doesn't apply cleanly to beta, but it's just a context mismatch, nothing about the patch itself needs to be changed.
