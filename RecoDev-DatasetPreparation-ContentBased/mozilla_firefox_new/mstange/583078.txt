Two toolbars with too much space

With the changes for bug 559033, 6 pixels of padding were added around toolbars.

They previously had none. This makes toolbars look really strange. Way too much space around them.

Screenshot attached.

This needs to block.  Also should we consider introducing lines to visually separate the third party toolbars?
Michael, what are the extensions in that screenshot?
Google Toolbar and an addon that I'm working on that will be released in the next few days.

I'll try some other toolbars as well.
I tried Web Developer toolbar, Operator, google toolbar. All have the same problem.
To be fixed by 547787?
Nope. Needs a separate fix.
Any plans to fix this?
Since it is blocking, I would assume the answer to that needs to be yes :)

This reduces the bottom padding for toolbars from 4px to 2px and brings back the separator lines.

This is the same selector except for #PersonalToolbar. Seems like #PersonalToolbar should have a separate margin rule at least.

-moz-appearance: none; background-color: -moz-mac-chrome-active; isn't needed for all toolbars?

No, only for those that shouldn't have separator lines. When the toolbar touches the title bar-, moz-appearance: toolbar draws a unified toolbar, and when it doesn't it draws -moz-mac-chrome-(in)active with a light border at the top and a dark border at the bottom.

I'm not sure why you're removing that comment, it seems that it should stay.

Isn't margin-top: 0 a no-op now?

It overwrites the margin-top: -1px from the #PersonalToolbar rule. That's the case when the navbar is hidden and the bookmarks toolbar is visible: in that case the bookmarks toolbar is adjacent to the tab bar, should get the gradient, and shouldn't overlay the bottom pixel of the tab bar.
You should adjust the comment to reflect that rather than dropping it.
I'll do so; dropping the comment wasn't intentional.
