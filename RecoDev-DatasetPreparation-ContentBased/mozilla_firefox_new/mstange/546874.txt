- Remove the top border and the gradient
- Use the Cocoa recessed scope bar button style for the buttons

like in the mockup in the URL field.

Why is #navigator-toolbox toolbarbutton:-moz-lwtheme part of this patch? Why under the /* ----- BOOKMARK BUTTONS ----- */ heading?

>+toolbarbutton.bookmark-item-microsummarized {

this appears to be a dead class

>+.bookmark-item > .toolbarbutton-icon {

the margin seems superfluous
Btw, why isn't this using -moz-appearance:toolbar?

This was supposed to be
#navigator-toolbox toolbarbutton.bookmark-item:-moz-lwtheme
so that I have a selector with enough specificity to override the color: inherit !important from #navigator-toolbox toolbarbutton:-moz-lwtheme. But I can just remove the !important from that rule.

-moz-appearance: toolbar has a top border that we don't want.

Do we normally want a top border? If not, why does it have a top border?

Yes, I think we do. It's a little hard to say because we don't have any non-unified toolbars in Firefox (apart from the bookmarks bar and a scope bar in the Places library window which has a different styling) and because I don't know of any native Cocoa app that we could use for inspiration - they all have either only one toolbar (which is unified) or the lower toolbar is a scope bar (which has a lighter gradient). The only exception is Safari: Safari 3 had a dark bookmarks bar which was separated with a "groove" border and Safari 4 got rid of that separator border completely (which is what we're doing with this patch, too).

So the question is whether extension windows that stack more than one toolbar on top of each other look better with the lighter top border. I think they do. See for example the DOM Inspector screenshot.

Add a comment for the negative margin? I guess it overlays a toolbar border.

Please remove this from winstripe while you're at it.

I think this might have had an unwanted effect, where the bookmarks will stretch as far as the title of the page, as in, they are not shortened and the end replace with three dots (...). Was this intended, or is it something we don't want to do?
Good catch, this was not intentional. Filed bug 548017.
