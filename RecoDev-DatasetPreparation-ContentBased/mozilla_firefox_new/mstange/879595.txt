OS X -- selected tab, background of the middle of the tab appears to be a gradient, whereas ends (and the navbar underneath) have a light noise texture. Hard to see. http://cl.ly/image/2F0b3Q3e0R14

(This is from my Retina MBP, if that matters)

Not taking this for M7.

This still needs testing on Windows and Linux. On Mac it seems to work fine.
I've had to remove the noise texture from tab-stroke*.png and tab-active-middle*.png so that the background matched properly between the tab parts and the navbar. Before landing, it would probably be good if Stephen exported his source images again, without the noise part.

s/fgTabRepeatedOverlay/fgTabNoise/? I can't think of a use for this other than a noise texture, and "repeated overlay" is ambiguous since fgTabTexture is also an overlay and whether it's repeated or not is meaningless. Confusingly, both images are also textures, so it might even make sense to rename the latter to fgTabGradient...

Renamed to fgTabNoise. I don't think renaming fgTabTexture to fgTabGradient belongs in this patch.

It's directly related to your changes, as adding a second texture-like graphic makes the term ambiguous where it used to be unambiguous. However, it's ok to handle this in a followup bug. Please file it then.
I've filed it as bug 882293.
Did you test this with lightweight themes? They also use browser-lightweightTheme.css.

It's not clear to me why we can't just have the same texture in the existing images? Was the problem that the texture was different? Another option was that it was not tiling properly and instead was being stretched. Less images should be more performant and I thought they all had textures anyways.

Huh. This works just as well. Don't know what I was seeing before..

These are two things that I suspected were the problem. The 92% was fine before we had the proper tab height.

Note for the future: This now needs to be 93% because the bottom of the tab now overlaps the nav-bar an extra pixel (bug 858089) compared to before. This color now exactly matches the colour [hsl(0,0%,93%)] used on #nav-bar in osx/browser.css.

We could make this a define although it's only used in these two places so I don't feel strongly about it.

Middle section of OS X tabs missing texture, just a plain gradient



Bug 879595 - Tile the background of the selected tab middle part properly and make the gradient connect smoothly to the toolbar. r=MattN
