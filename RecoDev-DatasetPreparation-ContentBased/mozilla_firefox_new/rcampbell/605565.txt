During a preliminary once-over of bug 599940, gavin discovered that the jsterm helper tests were not ported over during the deconstruction of HUDServiceTestsAll.

This bug is to add them back.

Seems like you could add a checkResult() helper that does the querySelector/is() checks:

function checkResult(msg, desc, lines) {
  let labels = jsterm.outputNode.querySelectorAll(".jsterm-output-line");
  is(labels.length, lines, "correct number of results shown for " + desc);
  is(labels[lines-1].textContent.trim(), msg, "correct message shown for " + desc);
}
