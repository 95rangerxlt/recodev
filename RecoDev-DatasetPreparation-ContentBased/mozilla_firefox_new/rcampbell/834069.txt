Nice! We might want to extend it in the future to choose between the original or unminified scripts, but this is fine for now.

This prints: "The debugger must be opened before setting breakpoints". I think we should either add a new string or maybe make the existing one more generic ("The debugger must be opened first" or "The debugger must be open for this operation to proceed").
ah yeah, good point. I'll add a new, more generic string.

Had the idea for a couple of optional parameters, a filter string if you want to limit your search by domain or filename and your suggestion's a good one as well.
