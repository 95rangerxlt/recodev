an egregious hack wip

It's not pretty, but it's based on some pretty ugly editor code to begin with. I think this has potential to be cleaned up and made less awful.

Editing text nodes should be straight-forward as well, but I will probably do that and tabbing in followups.
asking dcamp for addl feedback.

hoping to get back to this patch this week.
(working on that today)
(ok, but be careful. it's ugly.)

When is this going to be false?  What is it protecting against?

f+. The infobar is not updated though (even if we change a value, so it's a more general problem).

there are a bunch of different classes in the html panel's DOM nodes.

nodeName is specific to the attribute name. nodeValue is for the attributeValue, editGroup for the parent "group" node, etc. It'll be false for any of these as well as text nodes, twisties, ...

nodeName is what makes the attribute's name node a thing and this recognizes that you've clicked one.

Thanks for the feedback, guys. I'll polish this up and get it tested.

I could do the same as I do for the deleteNode code from the context menu. Invalidate the breadcrumbs on editor save? We'd also want to update the infobar if id or classes change.

html attribute name editing

finished patch. Didn't make any changes to the tree panel code for this round. It's adequate. May refactor on a subsequent patch.

includes a test.

r+ , Please update the comment of the onTreeDblClick method to reflect its new behavior ("attribute value" -> "attribute name or value").
