Steps to reproduce:

Steps

2. Opended the style pane and changed some value (color)
3. Closed the style pane. OK
4. Try to close the inspector (click on left cross). Not working
5. Tried to reload page. A bar appears on top, telling there was some mod. do i want to reload still ? 
6. Clicked on "leave page" but after reload the inspector is still open.

Can we get some testing on this? Looks like this occurred in Fx10.0a2 which should now be in Beta.
I'm unable to reproduce this in the same build. 

@bobi, can you check Error Console to see if anything comes up when failing to close the Inspect bar?

I found some steps to reproduce the Uncloseable Inspector.

1. Go to a webpage (this one will do).
2. Open the Inspector and lock a node.
3. Open the Markup panel (if necessary).
4. Double click an attribute value to open the editor
5. Close the Markup panel (without closing the popup text editor).
6. Click the close button on the inspector toolbar.

Expected Results:
Inspector should close.

Actual Result:
Inspector stays open. worse, appears across all tabs.

Thanks Rob. Can you confirm which Firefox version you used with these steps?
today's nightly.

This has NOT been resolved. I accidentally opened the inspector and can't close it no matter what. This is ridiculous.
Using Firefox 15 on Windows XP and have this problem. It needs fixing on the Windows version of Firefox. I accidentally opened it and can't close it.
Using Firefox 18 and Ubuntu 12.10 I still have this bug.

I believe this bug was specifically filed for Mac OSX. Though it would seem that you are not alone in reporting this is happening on other platforms as well.

Rob Campell, can you please advise if we should reopen this bug or file a new bug to address this issue on other platforms.
A lot of different things were causing this bug. We re-wrote the whole thing in Firefox 20. And it's fixed.
