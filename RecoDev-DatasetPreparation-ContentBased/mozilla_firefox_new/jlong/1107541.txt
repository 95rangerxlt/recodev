We can debug eval scripts now from bug 905700, but how we show scripts with a sourceURL pragma is broken. The correct filename is displayed, but it still has the "> eval" suffix, and worse, the source contents can't be loaded.

This is easily fixed with a few tweaks to how we handle it. We should probably uplift this as well since the train moved up on Tuesday.

Why mix using promises directly and using Task?

Why not spawn the task here and yield waitForSourceShown, etc? Would be cleaner, IMO.

Same comments for the other test file.

You can skip the function def + spawn and just do:

  const run = Task.async(function* () {
    ...

Nit: Which pragma? //# sourceMappingURL? (nope)

evalSourceWithDisplayURL?

Firefox Nightly reports Error loading source: loadSourceError.

When testing this in the console:
Function('return true;//# sourceURL=something/cool');

This fix has only just landed in fx-team, where it will incubate before being merged into mozilla-central. Tomorrow's Nightly should have the fix.
@jdalton what Nick said. Love that you commented here though. Please continue to point out places where it's broken!
Rock. I came here after digging into FF's support based on http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/59/.Support is being discussed for Underscore _.template (https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/issues/1973), Lo-Dash already supports sourceURLs.
