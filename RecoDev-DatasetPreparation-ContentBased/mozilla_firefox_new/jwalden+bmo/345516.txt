Rollup of all trunk changes, through spellchecking UI

This patch consists of all checkins to preferences and related code from July 4 through July 25 made by me (there seem to have been a few not made by me, but not to any files which I changed); in the vast majority of cases I copied the trunk file over the branch copy, but I hand-updated the jar.mns with an eye toward dealing with removed and new files.  I double-checked that the list of files corresponds to the list of files in a Bonsai query for changes made by me in that time (excluding some fonts changes which ended up being completely reverted), and I built the code and tested the resulting build for anything not known to be dysfunctional on trunk.

I don't expect this patch will be code-reviewed since the prefwindow changes are pretty much a rewrite, so if you have any other questions about verifying change integrity, ask and I'll answer.
Plussing, since this the branch landing for bug 340677

Rollup of all trunk changes, through spellchecking UI

This is provisionally approved for landing, once the bugs blocking this hit branch.
Checked in on branch, along with the approved fix for bug 345599 (so that localizers can directly copy trunk DTDs over branch DTDs to get a working localization -- otherwise, there's probably some manual work to do to get things synced properly, and if I can help out localizers a little here, I want to do it).  Consequently, all files on trunk should be the same as files on branch, and with that, this is fixed!  All future work preference window work will do the traditional trunk-bake-branch flow, and we can start getting the added testing goodness of the branch for feedback.
