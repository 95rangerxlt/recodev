Title says it all. Calling alert(Application.extensions) in the Error console returns null. Should return a fuelIExtensions interface.

Reproducible: Always

It will actually be most likely bug 407963 that caused this. For some reason though it implemented an nsIClassInfo for fuelApplication it fails to include extIApplication in the interface list and that also isn't included in the QI implementation.
and bug 420028 disabled Application.extensions tests
A fair bit of fuel is broken here, this should be fixed for final.

simple fix for calling base class methods

This patch fixes the call to the base class so the "this" reference is correct. It also adds extIApplication to the Application QI and getInterfaces methods.

The patch passes the basic extension tests found in bug 420028, which fail without this patch.
