Aza: the question is whether we should disable the items like "Reload All Tabs", "Close Other Tabs" and "Bookmark All Tabs" when there is one visible tab and some hidden tabs?

Does the "All" word mean all visible tabs or all (visible and hidden) tabs?
Raymond: "All" should mean for this group only. In other words, only visible tabs. When we are down at only one visible tab (i.e., one tab in the group) then we should hide the items that act on multiple tabs (like reload all tabs, etc.).
Also feel free to assign any design-related bugs to me directly :)
