Firefox changed to &BrandShortName in the files specified.

For variable names that included the word "Firefox" in the middle of it, it still says "Firefox" so that we don't get an undefined variable; i.e. "restartFirefoxNocacheDesc" still reads "restartFirefoxNocacheDesc" and not "restart&BrandShortNameNocacheDesc"

For strings that have Firefox in the variable name, we should still change those, but as you found out we can't use brandShortName there. For those, you can just change 'Firefox' to 'Browser', but keep the casing as it was before.

Were you able to test these changes? I can help you out with building and figuring out how to test these.

.properties files will not allow DTD entities to be placed within the string. You'll need to use special identifiers which can then be used by external localization functions to replace the identifier with a user-facing string.

For example, see the results for this search on MXR: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/find?text=social.remove.label&string=
Jared's comments are good ones. This needs to be updated to use a formatting string and the method that uses it should be changed to getFormattedString.

Raymond and I talked on IRC and he showed me that in browser/locales/en-US/installer/custom.properties $BrandShortName is used. I didn't know about this before, but if it works for you then that's cool with me. Note that you need to use a dollar sign here ($) and not an ampersand (&).

These entities need to have a semicolon after them and a lower-case b, so &brandShortName;

If these names change then you also need to change the code that references them. Did you build with these changes and test it out?

Also, for all of the strings that required changes, the name will need to be updated so the localizers are aware that the string has changed and for them to include $BrandShortName.

Proposed Patch

Majority of the bug is fixed in this patch. Rather than a hard-coded "Firefox", the name of whatever browser is being used (could still be "Firefox", could be "Nightly", could be whatever else the name is) is displayed where necessary to the user in the GCLI commands - with one exception: introTextOpening in gcli.properties still uses the hard-coded "Firefox" since the only other file that references it is gcli.jsm, which is auto-generated and not to be modified. Info on this would be appreciated.
The original sources for GCLI are located here:

https://github.com/joewalker/gcli

However, since it is meant to be used outside Firefox as well, I don't know if the localization setup we have here will be applicable in other contexts. I'm not sure how Joe wants to deal with this, so let's ask him directly.

Thanks for asking Raymond - I think that exhortation to not update the generated files is a bit heavy handed and unrealistic.

There are 2 options for you:
1. Ignore the message, update gcli.properties and send it to me for review, and I'll keep GCLI in sync
2. Check out the sources that Panos points you to, find the source of the offending string, and send me a pull request, and do step 1.

Thanks.

Okay, well as far as doing step 1 goes, the only change that would be made to the file gcli.properties would just be switching the word "Firefox" to "%1$S" on line 336. That's the easy part. The thing I was having problems with was getting the string formatted elsewhere. If you look at my proposed patch, you'll see that CmdResize.jsm and BuiltInCommands.jsm are the files that actually fetch the browser name to format the strings in gclicommands.properties - it's just that neither of those files referenced introTextOpening from gcli.properties - that string was referenced ONLY by gcli.jsm

So, maybe I'm not understanding this correctly because it seems fairly trivial to accomplish step 1. Do you just want me to update gcli.properties (it would just be that one line modified, and I guess another line added in the comments above it explaining that the argument represents the name of the browser), send that to you for review, and then you'll update GCLI (including gcli.jsm) to format this particular string (introTextOpening) correctly? Sorry if I got that wrong.

Thanks.

No - you got it right, I'd forgotten that this was read by gcli.jsm, sorry!

So can I suggest a hack:

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (introTextOpening): The 'intro text' opens when the user
# first opens the developer toolbar to explain the command line, and is shown
# each time it is opened until the user clicks the 'Got it!' button. This
# string is the opening paragraph of the intro text.
introTextOpening=This is a command line designed for developers. It focuses on speed of input over JavaScript syntax and a rich display over monospace output.

i.e. s/The Firefox command line is/This is a command line/

What do you think?

Proposed Patch (Version 4)

This patch displays the browser name where necessary (not "Firefox" hard-coded), plus there was a workaround in displaying the browser name in introTextOpening from gcli.properties by just rewriting the string to say "This command line" instead of "The Firefox command line". Thanks to jwalker for that idea.

Also, 8 lines of context are included in the patch.

Yes, they should have been changed and should still be changed so that localizers who haven't gotten around to translating yet will notice.

It appears that the following feedback was not addressed:

This is bad. Please reopen, backout and recommit with properly altered entity identifiers. And please do not land similar L10n non-approved patches anymore. Thanks.

So Raymond, sorry I forgot to check the key changes.

The issue here is that localizers won't necessarily know to update the strings because their tools don't tell them about changes to existing strings, just about new strings. So in order to keep the localizations in sync, we have to change the keys when we make non-trivial changes to strings.

So rather than:
  -restartBrowserDesc=Restart %1$S
  +restartFirefoxDesc=Restart Firefox

We need to do:
  -restartBrowserDesc=Restart %1$S
  +restartFirefoxDesc2=Restart Firefox

And obviously make similar changes to the JS.

Sometimes people try to keep the names looking 'sensible' by doing a swap from restartBrowserDesc to restartBrowserTitle rather than restartBrowserDesc2 but in this case we're following a pattern where Desc means something specific as does restart etc.

Do you think you can make the changes? Or would you like someone else to?

Okay, I can get that taken care of. It seems simple enough.

But let me first just make sure I'm not going crazy here. This is what you said:

> So rather than:
>   -restartBrowserDesc=Restart %1$S
>   +restartFirefoxDesc=Restart Firefox
> 
> We need to do:
>   -restartBrowserDesc=Restart %1$S
>   +restartFirefoxDesc2=Restart Firefox

But if "-" means subtract and "+" means add, I would think it's the opposite of that. I took OUT the lines that used the term "Firefox" and added IN lines that used "Browser" and "%1S$".

So, is this what it's supposed to say?

> So rather than:
>   -restartFirefoxDesc=Restart Firefox
>   +restartBrowserDesc=Restart %1$S
> 
> We need to do:
>   -restartFirefoxDesc=Restart Firefox

Thanks.
(In reply to Joe Walker [:jwalker] from comment #24)
> So rather than:
>   -restartBrowserDesc=Restart %1$S
>   +restartFirefoxDesc=Restart Firefox

Wrong example, the key changed here.

This is the right example (and there are other 3, if I didn't miss others)
-screenshotChromeDesc=Capture %1$S chrome window? (true/false)
+screenshotChromeDesc=Capture Firefox chrome window? (true/false)

BTW I opened bug 845279 to fix this since I was previously told that in devtools you don't reopen bugs :-\
Thanks Flod, for making the point about key names:

So to be clear:
    -screenshotChromeDesc=Capture Firefox chrome window? (true/false)
    +screenshotChromeDesc=Capture %1$S chrome window? (true/false)

Becomes:
    -screenshotChromeDesc=Capture Firefox chrome window? (true/false)
    +screenshotChromeDesc2=Capture %1$S chrome window? (true/false)

(And I'll stop doing bugmail late at night!)

Entity names changed where necessary. Specifically:

I thought there was more than just those 3, but after checking several times, I couldn't find any others that weren't already changed (like "Firefox" --> "Browser"). If I missed anything, please let me know.

Good catch. It's been changed to introTextOpening2 in both gcli.properties and gcli.jsm
