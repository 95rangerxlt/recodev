Push backed out for causing frequent failures in browser_bug400731.js on debug mochitest-other (primarily OS X 10.6, but occurred on other platforms too):

Relanded with proof (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=0b822e1874cf) that this is kosher!

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/129f5457378e

I believe the test failures were caused by bug 800394 which I fixed too.

Is "#ifdef" etc legitimate in a .jsm file? My local (inbound, debug) build is spewing "SyntaxError: illegal character" messages that seem to originate here.
Ah, it's supposed to be preprocessed... apparently my build still had a symlink back to the un-preprocessed file, and needed clobbering in order to pick this up properly. Sorry for the noise.

No worries, this is not your fault.  Please file a bug in Core::Build Config to get this fixed.  Thanks!
