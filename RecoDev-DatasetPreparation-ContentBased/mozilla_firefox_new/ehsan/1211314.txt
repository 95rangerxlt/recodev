1. Open new tab (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about)
2. Play video in the page
3. Mute the tab
4. Switch to another page
5. Make sure you have option "don't load tab until selected" enabled. Restart the browser
6. Move mouse over the sound indicator on tab in Step 1

Result:       Tooltip is wrong (and button is functioning wrong)
Expectations: Tooltip should be correct; pressing sound indicator
              should unmute the pending tab from Step 1

It seems like the solution to bug 1195150 is incomplete.  What happens here is that we end up calling setAttribute("muted", "true") on the tab but we never call mute() on it, so its audioMuted property remains false.  We later on correct this in onStateChange but this is visible before that stage as comment 0 suggests.

I think we need to start using toggleMuteAudio() in sessionstore, similar to what we do with pinTab and unpinTab.

Use tab.toggleMuteAudio() from sessionstore instead of setting the muted attribute manually on the tab
