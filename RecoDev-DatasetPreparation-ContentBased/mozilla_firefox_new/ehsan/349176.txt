About Firefox [fa-IR] - Main layout

Some pixels of first words of each line are out of drawing box.
Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).
I can reproduce the "Powered by GeckoTM" thing on Hebrew Firefox 3.1b2pre. The fastest solution would be to add LRM character to the string.

This happens because the HTML container element is LTR, we need to fix this.

This does happen on trunk, which we need to fix.

I think they are intentionally left English.  Is that right, Axel?

> - US EU note is useless for non-US users.

Axel should provide feedback here.

Patch (v1)

This is a trivial patch to make sure that all translatable text pieces appear RTL for RTL locales in credits.xhtml.
No idea about the trademark piece. Harvey?
What determines whether an element should have a dir attribute set? I'm not sure I really understand why it's needed on some elements but not others, or why you can't just set it on the document body.
This page includes some English text, which is LTR, so if I set the dir on the body element, that text would also be made LTR.  (There is also some markup responsible of showing the graphics on that page, which I wasn't sure how it would turn up in RTL mode -- but I didn't test that).

In this patch, I have set the direction attribute only on the elements which have translatable link.  This way, only those elements which are actually translated will get the RTL direction for RTL locales.
