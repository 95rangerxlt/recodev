Further, I'd support it if the Panorama button was added to the toolbar the first time it was activated, since that indicates a user who has decided they want to use the feature.

Such handling could be done in Panorama itself, during the "firstrun" behavior (displaying the welcome tab), which is tracked in the browser.panorama.experienced_firstrun pref.

These test adjustments are needed because the button doesn't exist by default any more.

If user has multiple browser windows opened, then enters Panorama for the first time.  Does this patch add the tabview-button to all existing browser windows?

The browserShared.inc change is wrong, #tabview-button needs to be part of that list just like the other optional buttons.

This doesn't persist the currentset, does it?

What if alltabs-button has been removed? Seems like you'd append after tabs-closebutton then.

Also, can we move this to a separate bug?

Remove removable="true".

I filed bug 626791 for that.  I'm not going to work on it though, since I seem to not be familiar enough with the toolbar stuff.

s/buttonCommand/tabViewCommand/

The button isn't of interest here, I don't think there's a point in verifying that it doesn't exist.

Also, buttonCommand.doCommand() makes ok(buttonCommand, ...) redundant.

That's the whole point behind this bug, so I think I'm going to keep that check around.

It's not the point of the test. All the test wants is to open panorama.

Don't put the Panorama button on the tab bar by default
