STR:

1) Open Firefox
2) Pin it to the taskbar
3) Close Firefox
4) Right-click the icon and choose "New private window"

You'll see an error in the console saying:

"Warning: unrecognized command line flag -private-window"

(Funnily, it's an error that says it's a warning.)

Consume the -private-window command line argument in per-window PB builds

In global PB builds, we handled this flag inside the service.  Now that the service
does not exist any more, this gets left unhandled.

Turns out that handleFlag returns bool not int.  Rookie mistake!

Verified as fixed in Firefox 20 beta 1 (buildID: 20130220104816) using STR from comment 0.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130415 Firefox/23.0

I couldn't verify on Latest Nightly(Build ID:20130415030812), because after step 4 from STR, "New private window" button does not exist. There are just "Nightly" and "Unpin this program from taskbar" buttons.

What if you run Firefox once again and then close it?
I tried to run Firefox several times and the same result.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130428 Firefox/23.0 (Build ID: 20130428031010)

I have the same issue as Mitza: can't reproduce step 4, the "New private window" button does not appear; only the "Nightly" and "Unpin this program from taskbar" buttons appear.
