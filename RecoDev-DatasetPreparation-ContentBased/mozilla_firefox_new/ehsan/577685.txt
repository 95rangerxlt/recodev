Adding search engines during private browsing mode is a privacy violation because the website visited can be easily inferred from the search engine's meta data.  We need to disable the option of adding search engines inside the private browsing mode.

Patch (v1)
Hmm, how is this different than bookmarks? Aren't the privacy implications just as obvious?
We have another bug on file to disable adding bookmarks in private browsing mode for Firefox 4 as well.  :-)
(should probably get ui-review on this explicitly)
I believe that the UI decision around Bookmarks, Add-Ons and other "additions" to Firefox was that they should persist beyond the Private Browsing session.

That might need to be revisited: if we do revisit it, we should disable those controls in the Private Browsing mode.

An explicit non-goal would be having bookmarks that are only visible when in private browsing, of course :)
beltzner: see comment 2/3! The bug Ehsan refers to is bug 566010.

uir+a=beltzner, I'm sure faaborg will agree - this patch disables the ability to add search engines in private browsing mode

(Gavin: I saw the comment, didn't see the bug, oops!)
