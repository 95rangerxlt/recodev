Review of attachment 8646131:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Can you comment as to why this change should be made? The bug doesn't say anything at all really :(
This way the function runs after all of the tabs from the previous function have been closed, and since this test is independent, it would be better for it to be isolated.

I'll add this to the commit message.
