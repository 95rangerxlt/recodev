STR:
1. Open Cookie exceptions dialog.
2. Enter or Copy/Paste a URL starts with http:// or https://
3. Select a rule.

Expected result:
New rule is accepted and display correctly.

Actual result:
Display "moz-nullprincipal:~" in URL field and rule becomes invalid.
So, I can't register exception rules for various sites using https (for example: bugzilla.mozilla.org!).

Regression range:
Not tested. But probably the problem happens in 07-18 and 07-19 nightly.
Are changes in Permission Manager related?
