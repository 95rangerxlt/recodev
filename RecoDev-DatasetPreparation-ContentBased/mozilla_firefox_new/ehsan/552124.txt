Steps to reproduce

1. Browse to a few different websites
2. Put focus in the url bar
3. Press platform-specific "undo" key combination (ctrl-z on windows, cmd-z on
   mac)
4. Notice that you can see the URLs of the websites visited in step 1
5. Enter private browsing mode
6. Visit a few websites
7. Exit private browsing mode
8. Repeat step 2
9. Repeat step 3
10. Notice that you can see websites visited while in private browsing mode in
    step 6.


So what is happening here is that our normal undo functionality "remembers" all visited websites. And it is agnostic to entering and exiting private browsing mode.

One fix would be to simply clear the undo history when private browsing mode is exited from all open url-bars. Though to be honest I wonder if we should *always* clear the history when a new page is opened.

I'm not sure if this bug needs to be hidden or not. Leaving that up to the security folks. It does sound bad if people start running around inspecting each others private browsing history.

Brandon recommended that this be marked sg:low as that is where we usually put privacy bugs.

Oh, and to be clear, in steps 3 and 9 above, you'll probably have to "undo" multiple times.

Patch (v1)

So, I could just fix this for the private browsing case, but I don't think that the current behavior actually makes any sense.  I think that conceptually, the location bar belongs to the page being displayed, so things like changing tabs or going to another link should not leave traces inside the location bar.

With this patch, the undo command is available when the user is manipulating the contents of the location bar, but clears the history when a new URI is set.  This will take care of the private browsing problem as well.

Johnath recommended me to ask for Gavin's review to check with him if this behavior change is acceptable.

I don't really agree... the URL bar is conceptually related to the tab rather than the page being viewed, and I see no reason to clear undo history on normal page navigation. I think I would prefer a private-browsing specific solution.
Personally I think it's extremely weird that switching back and forth between two tabs means that I build up undo history for the url bar.

But I'm less interested in the UI design issue, more interested in getting the privacy issue fixed.

per comment 3
This bug is currently marked blocking 1.9.3alpha4, which was originally scheduled for Monday. If it cannot land today, does it still need to block the devpreview schedule?
Crafting a patch right now.  If I can get a quick review, this can land today.

Patch (v2)

Approved for 1.9.2.4 and 1.9.1.10, a=dveditz for release-drivers

Checking in the test gives away the bug. Please hold off on checking in tests for hidden bugs (or else does that mean the bug is incorrectly hidden?).
I don't think there's any point to hiding bugs about flaws with the private browsing functionality, in general. I think that knowing its limitations is just as (or perhaps even more, given Bugzilla's audience) likely to help potential victims than it is to help attackers.

So I'd vote to just open this bug.

I think it's in fact incorrectly hidden, in my opinion.  It is not a security issue, it's only a privacy issue, and we've had a lot of privacy bugs in private browsing which were openly filed, discussed and fixed.  Anyway, I'll hold off on checking this in to branches until either it's opened by a member of the security group, or we're close to the code freeze for branches.
