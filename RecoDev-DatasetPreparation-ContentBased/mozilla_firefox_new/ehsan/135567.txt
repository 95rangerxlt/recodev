nsbeta1- per Nav triage team, ->1.2
Close Tab should be C for consistency with the file menu in the single-tab case.
 T should be reserved for New Navigator Tab (bug 135804) for consistency with
the link context menu.

sairuh,
_C_lose Window --- Ctrl+Shift+W is a way to implement.
Do you want to use Alt+one character to implement this?
it would be (barring web page access key conflicts ;)

Alt-F, which drops down the File menu, followed by hitting the 'c' key by itself
(or the 't' key) to close the window (or tab, respectively).
Ok, how about:

_C_lose Tab (which is already there)
Close _W_indow

(Since Ctrl+W is the same for Close and Close Tab, the accesskey should be the
same also)

hm, unfortunately the W conflicts with the access key for _W_ork Offline. how
about the suggestion in comment 0? i don't see conflicts there.
Good point, i must be blind :)

The reason against changing Close Tab to use a different letter is that it should
have the same letter as the Close item when no other tabs are open - in the same 
way that the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+W in both instances. Only other option is
to use "i" for Close Window (its the only other free accesskey).
ah, good point. i wouldn't mind using "i".

jglick / aaronl, what do you think?
In general we should avoid using l or i unless there is no other choice, because
they are very thin, so it is hard to see the underline.

The is something I learned by reading Microsoft's guidelines for choosing
accesskeys. I folded all of their accesskey wisdom and ours into a XUL accesskey
FAQ, which is here: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/accesskey.html


Aaron, do you reckon it better to leave the Close Tab accesskey as it is and use 
i for Close Window (see comment 11), or do you think its better to change it?
How about 
Close Ta_b_
_C_lose Window

This avoids using i for an accesskey, which is very hard to see the underline
on, and stays in line with our general accesskey principles.
Aaron, ok, if you're up for changing the accesskey of Close Tab, what's wrong with
the suggestion in comment 0?
Sorry, I didn't read  the whole bug before. I guess what Jesse says in comme 3
makes sense.

Jesse, do you have a suggestion?
there's some talk of adding Close Other Tab to the File menu --see bug 103354
and 191818 (and maybe others, sigh).
adt: nsbeta1-
Moving to Firefox.

I think "d" can be used as the access key for the Close Window item.  It's free, and it doesn't have the problem mentioned in comment 13.

I'll be posting a patch to do that shortly.
Removing the helpwanted keyword.

Seamonkey: Correct File menu items access keys

This fix changes the "Send Link" access key from d to k, and then assigns the following access keys:

 * Close Other Tabs -> T
 * Close Window     -> d
Comment on attachment 271487
Seamonkey: Correct File menu items access keys

I would suggest leaving 'd' for "Send Link", and using 'i' for "Close Window". Less change that way for people who are used to alt+f d.

'T' for "Close Other Tabs" is fine, though I would pick 't' to associate with "Other", not "Tabs".

Neil, your thoughts?

Hmmm, but i is a narrow character, and once it's underlined, it may not be visible at first site.  See comment 13.

How come?

For some reason Mail uses l for Offline and that's barely noticable.

Maybe change "Work Offline" to k? Fewer people would use that, I guess.

No, you should always prefer to use capitals where possible.

Hmmm, I for one use Alt+F, W extensively.  Of course I may not be considered typical user.

Thinking of it, recently I use that key combination less often in Firefox, since it now can automatically adjust offline settings with the network connectivity of the computer.  If there are similar plans for Seamonkey as well, then maybe we can switch Work Offline's access key.

Is the document previously located at <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/accesskey.html> available somewhere?
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL_Accesskey_FAQ_and_Policies perhaps?
jag, do you think you can review attachment 271847?  I'm not too familiar with seamonkey review process, but this has been in the review queue for over two months...

Thanks!

I think I prefer Neil's suggestion of using 'k' for Work Offline, 'W' for Close Window, and keep 'd' on Send Link.

jag, perhaps you can handle sr on this as well?
I was gonna say that Neil should get a chance to do it, but he already did.
Thanks for r/sr, jag.

Nominating the patch in attachment 293113 for checkin, which should fix the SeaMonkey side of this bug, and mark it as RESOLVED FIX.
Thank Neil for the sr.
