Will pwmgr_common.js and notification_common.js still be available to plain mochitests?

Sure, I didn't remove them from MOCHITEST_FILES, if that's what you mean...

Backed out for test failures (the merge over to m-c was accidental on my part, I'll merge the backout over later).

Josh, did you test this locally or on try?
Locally. I'm investigating.
(In reply to comment #17)
> Locally. I'm investigating.

Yeah for whatever reason this doesn't happen locally.  I think we're relying on something that is there in an objdir but not in the test packages.  Sorry, I thought I had mentioned this on the bug...
