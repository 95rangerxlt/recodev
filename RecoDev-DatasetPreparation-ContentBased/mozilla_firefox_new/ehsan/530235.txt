This is a follow up bug from bug 528416 comment # 11, where sdwilsh notes that we control the entries in the Window's Recent Documents menu.

When we are in private browsing mode, we should be sure to never add anything to the Recent Documents menu.  Additionaly if we actually have the ability to remove entries (and not just control what we add) we should remove any entries that we added based on the time range of a Clear Recent History operation.

Should be pretty easy to add a mInPrivateBrowsing check to nsDownload::SetState before the call to SHAddToRecentDocs.
(nsDownloadManager::gDownloadManagerService->mInPrivateBrowsing, I guess)

I guess writing a test for this would be rather tricky given our troubles with test_bug_401430.js... I take it you've tested it manually, though :)

Yes, that is why I didn't write a test for it.
