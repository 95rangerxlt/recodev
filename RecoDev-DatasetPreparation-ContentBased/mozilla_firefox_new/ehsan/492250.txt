The URLs in the Media tab of the Page Info dialog should appear LTR even if the UI is RTL.

This is similar to bug 478430.

Can you not check column.element.id instead?

(Unrelated to this patch, but it looks like columnids and colcount are unused in this file?)

Yes.  Done in the new revision.  Also moved the check to the getCellProperties which actually gets used... :/

Yeah, I think so.  I'll file a new bug on this.

Well that's confusing. Can you remove the unused getCellProperties, and cache both atoms used by the real one ("ltr" and "broken")?

The other getCellProperties gets used by the meta tags tree.

I added the code to cache "broke" in this version of the patch.

You're calling getAtom and passing an atom? Even if that works, it's not optimal!

I'd be a lot more comfortable reviewing patches if this functionality had some tests. Several of the patches for this bug appear to have been untested (original one didn't touch the right function, this one potentially breaks broken-styling, etc.)

Fixed.

You're right, but I'm not sure how I can test this.  As a demo of how this patch looks, I took a screenshot of the Page Info window for this URL: data:text/html,<img src="http://www.google.com/"><img src="http://www.google.com/logo.png">

The platform level functionality landed in bug 478377 is tested in the reftest suite.  Maybe we should have Litmus tests here?

What exactly do you want the litmus test to do (since I don't entirely understand what this patch does)?

I don't particularly think that a Litmus test is necessary here, but I'll leave the final decision to Gavin.
