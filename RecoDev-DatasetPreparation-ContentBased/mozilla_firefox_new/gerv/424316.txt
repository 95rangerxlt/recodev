"about:" currently says:

Read the release notes for this version.

but the words "the release notes" are not a link because of bug 349985. (about: doesn't have privileges to read the release notes URL from the prefs.) This looks really unprofessional - it looks like an instruction to the user without any help to carry it out. The Release Notes are also available from the Help menu, which is probably their primary access point anyway.

The quick fix is simply to remove/comment out this line from the HTML. A more complex fix might be to preprocess the HTML during the build process to insert the URL.

Patch v.1

Patch to comment out relevant line in about.xhtml. This seems such a tiny change it's not worth asking for an explicit review; I would hope the driver doing approvals can rubber-stamp the insertion of a matching pair of HTML comment markers. :-)

Requesting "blocking" status as a polish item, or as a route to "wanted" status.

Patch v.1

We'll look at this after b5; at least this simple fix, but johnath might have ideas about how to make the link active.
This really isn't a blocker, we don't link to about: from anywhere...
