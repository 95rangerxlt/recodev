about:license needs a tidy-up:

- some of the licenses are in the wrong order or have inconsistent headings
- the proprietary ActiveX licence needs breaking out into its own section, with 
  a link to our policy on such things

I'm sure I'll find more stuff as I go through it.

Patch v.1

This patch fixes various inconsistencies, too-long line lengths (bug 638813), makes the Windows-specific proprietary section appear only on Windows (bug 688377) and adds the Apache License 2.0 (bug 729457).
