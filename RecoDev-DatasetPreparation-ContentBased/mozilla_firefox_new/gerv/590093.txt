Requesting blocking status as this should be done before Firefox4 is shipped.
Can someone please point me at a copy of Firebug's licence?

I would assume that license.txt in the Firebug source's root folder would be it:
http://fbug.googlecode.com/svn/branches/firebug1.7/license.txt
Created attachment 475883
Patch v.1
Why is this nom'd for approval?  It explicitly blocks.
Oh, OK. I'll check it in soon, then :-)

Fixed on trunk.
