Fix path

I've got 

Timestamp: 04.12.2012 09:41:15
Error: NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND: Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.import]
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbox.xml
Line: 781

error after click on another tab in js console, you can find my not-so-common setup in Bug 782890.
I suppose that path to TelemetryStopwatch.jsm should be "resource:///gre/modules/TelemetryStopwatch.jsm" instead of "resource:///modules/TelemetryStopwatch.jsm".
