The Ctrl-Tab panel (needs to be enabled via browser.ctrlTab.previews) has a "Show all X tabs" button that used to open another panel with thumbnails, but now it merely opens the "all tabs" popup. To account for that, it should say "list" rather than "show". And while we're at it, it should use title capitalization.

Abdelrhman, would you be interested in taking this bug?

rev 1 - Show all X tabs

I failed to explain how string changes are handled in the Mozilla code base. For this kind of change, we need to notify all non-en-US locales so that they make the same change as en-US. Just changing the en-US string value won't do that. Instead, we need to change the string id (ctrlTab.listAllTabs.label would be a good one, for instance).
