Reproducible with: 
- Firefox 35 Beta 5 - BuildID: 20141218174327
- Firefox 36 Aurora latest - BuildID: 20141219004003
- Firefox 37 Nightly latest - BuildID: 20141218030202

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Click the search magnifying glass in the search field and select "Change Search Settings".
3. In the list of one-click search engines, drag an engine by its name into a different position in the list.
4. In the same list of search engines attempt to drag providers by their checkbox.

Expected results:
Drag is not supported and the only action performed is select/deselect.
OR
Drag is supported and is performed correctly (but then there is no select/deselect action also recorded in this case).

Actual results:
Both the drag and the selection is performed, but the result of the drag action is that the search engine in step #3 is actually moved to the new position. See http://www.screencast.com/t/qDCeOuDxS9Q.

Note that if step #3 is skipped, then only the selection action is performed (no drag action is performed).

I think we should just prevent dragging from the checkboxes.

Returning early in this function http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/3d846527576f/browser/components/preferences/in-content/search.js#l192 will prevent the drag operation.

The event parameter is a drag event, documented at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/dragstart

There's a code sample here showing how to convert the clientX/clientY coordinates into a row and column:

rev 1 - prevent dragging engines from checkbox

Hello,

I added isCheckBox method to EngineView in this patch instead of editing isSelectable and use it because it may be used for another thing.

Looks good, could you please make the same change to the non-in-content version of the file?

There's an "  // nsITreeView" comment above this whole section of the code that indicates this part of the code only implements the nsITreeView interface. Could you please add a comment above isCheckBox indicating that it's just a helper, and not part of nsITreeView?

I've moved isCheckBox to Helpers section "// Helpers" instead of adding comment in nsITreeView section.

Yuck. Please use the newer and better API:

var cell = tbo.getCellAt(aEvent.clientX, aEvent.clientY);
if (selectedIndex >= 0 && !gEngineView.isCheckBox(cell.row, cell.col)) {

Somebody please update that example?
