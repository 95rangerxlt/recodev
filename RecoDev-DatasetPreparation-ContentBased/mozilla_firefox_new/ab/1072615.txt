We should update the hotfix to upgrade to 32.0.3
Created attachment 8495365
Patch v1

I ran the import-installers.py script and manually made changes to mimic what was done in the patch in bug 1061927.

Some of the text changes ("32" => "32.0.3") seem unnecessary but they shouldn't hurt anything and if someone needs to figure out how to do this in the future it is nice for the patch to actually touch all the correct locations.

Is this testable, or does it depend on some other bug for deployment of the Hotfix (as it's the case for bug 1061927)?
Once bug 1061975 is complete, this bug can be tested by downloading the signed hotfix and verifying that the hotfix does indeed install Firefox 32.0.3.

It's probably better to test this as part of the QA signoff that needs to happen in bug 1061975.
