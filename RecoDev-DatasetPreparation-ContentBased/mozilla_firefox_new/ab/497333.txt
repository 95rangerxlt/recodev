See this Screenshot.

I cannot judge whether this depends on my environment...
Does anyone reproduce this on Windows 2000 SP4?
confirmed.
Windows 2000 SP4/ja.
if you remove the ?raw=1 everything works fine.

It is not such a problem. 
I say that Windows 2000 SP4 cannot display New Firefox 3.5 icon (firefox.ico). 

firefox.ico that exists in this archive is also the same. 
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=492431#c22

firefox.exe that does the build including firefox.ico might be also the same.
so yes i can confirm the ico file in that archive is not working on 200 sp4. i tried changin icon to another app pointing to the ico file, and it does not see any icon.
This may need to be considered a blocker bug since having an app icon is kind of important, nominating.

Try this file to see if it works in your environment.

Er, yikes. Someone googling what format W2K .ico files need?
The 8-bit versions we include in the .ico should work, some initial theories include:

-the 8-bit versions are not correct, causing them not to render

-the inclusion of Vista 256x256 version in the same file is causing Windows 2000 to be confused, and nothing is rendering
It looks like theory 1 is a winner, I'll spend some time today attempting to recreate the files, making sure that the 8-bit versions are generated correctly.
I see only 24bpp versions inside the ico file, while it should also include 256 and 16 colors versions.
what are you using to inspect the file, and are you seeing multiple 24bpp
versions of each resolution?
actually i simply opened it with irfanview.
i see
256*256*24bpp
48*48*24bpp
32*32*24bpp
16*16*24bpp
48*48*24bpp
32*32*24bpp
16*16*24bpp
48*48*24bpp
32*32*24bpp
16*16*24bpp

clearly last 6 ones should be 16bpp and 8bpp.
oh, and 128*128*24bpp
I've gotten the icon to work on Windows 2000 SP4 with only the 8 and 4 bit versions packaged (and only 48, 32, 16 resolutions).  

This initially appears to be some form of Vista to 2000 icon compatibility problem, which is unfortunate.  If there was simply something wrong with the lower bit versions it would have been significantly easier to diagnose.  I'll keep working on it until we know what is going on.
The icon only fails to display as soon as a 256x256 32 bit version is packaged, packaging a 128x128 down to 16x16 (with 32, 8 and 4 bit versions) works fine.

File to test with 128x128 down

The only thing different with this icon file is that it does not package a 256x256 resolution version.  It displays correctly in my instance of 2000 SP4 at all resolutions and bit depths.
I figured it out, the issue was that the icon was packaging both a 256x256 and a 128x128 copy, and Windows 2000 can only handle ignoring one or the other. If you package both, it fails.

According to the MSDN article on vista icons, only 256x256 is a standard size:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511280.aspx#size
http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Aa511280.Icons14(en-us,MSDN.10).png

The inclusion of the 128x128 version in the grid was likely a mistake, since the file contained layers for both Windows and OS X (where 128x128 is in fact a standard size).  Removing this resollution should have no effect on XP and Vista, and will make things work on 2000.

Also, I found that generating an icon file with both 256x256 and 128x128 versions using a different tool (in this case gamani's gif movie gear), will also create a file that fails on 2000.  So the issue is not the tool being used to create the icon, but rather the resolutions that are packaged in the icon.  Overall this is more of an issue with Windows 2000's ability to ignore information that it does not expect, than a bug with the tools we are using.
Alex: that's fantastic information to have, and we should probably document it ... somewhere. I take it we can expect a new version of the file without the 128x128 version?
just testing everything out to be totally sure (since this effects all versions of windows), then I can attach the file and we can resolve.

Screen shot of the icon now working

Here we see the icon being displayed at the two supported resolutions (32x32 and 16x16) at all three bit depths (32 bit, 16 and 4).

I need to test the file as well on XP and Vista just to be careful, and then we can get it checked in and resolve the bug.

New firefox.ico file

This needs to replace the file currently at /other-licenses/branding/firefox/firefox.ico

I visually inspected this file at all bit depths and sizes on 2000 SP4, XP, and Vista.  I have not tested it on Windows 7 yet.
Rob: can you try the new icon file out on Windows 7
(by try do you mean build? I have Windows 7 and can inspect ..)
>(by try do you mean build? I have Windows 7 and can inspect ..)

Not needed to test the file.  You can just download the file to your desktop, grab a shortcut to minefield (or anything really), and change it's icon to the new file (properties > shortcut > change icon...), then view it at the entire set of available resolutions in Explorer, by coping the shortcut into the dock(?) changing desktop settings, etc.

Ah, I see, Vlad and Alex taught me better tricks, here.

Yeah, this looks great on Windows 7 as well.

Exe file with the new icon

No need to change the icon. It will show up after it's in the exe. The current firefox icon has the exact same "problem". For some reason Windows 2000 cannot display the new "Vista" .ico files, but when the icon is compiled in the exe it works.
