Treat about:newtab just like about:blank

Thanks for the patch!

This looks fine to me, but I'd like to run it by Tim first.  Tim, you're working on SessionStore now, right?

Thanks for updating it.  I'll carry over Tim's r+, r=ttaubert.
Thank you all!
Sid, can you please format your patch so that we can check it in? It currently lacks the necessary header information, like the patch author and patch name. Here's a great blog post that describes how to prepare your patch for "checkin-needed":
