25.0.1 has been released and https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/25.0.1/releasenotes/ currently links to https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox.html , but that currently lacks any info on bugs fixed in 25.0.1.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=935959 says 25.0.1 includes NSS 3.15.3.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS/NSS_3.15.3_release_notes says that includes fixes for CVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5605 and CVE-2013-5606.

i guess https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox.html needs to be updated ASAP.
