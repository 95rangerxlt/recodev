I am routinely using three RSS feeds via Live Bookmarks. When I upgraded from Firefox 1.5 to 2.0 one of them has all entries corrupted in the form of double entries: each link in the feed is exacactly the concatenation of the correct link with itself. This happens with all entries in the the RSS feed of the Italian newspaper La Repubblica http://www.repubblica.it/rss/homepage/rss2.0.xml, but not with two other feeds I am using: http://www.spiegel.de/schlagzeilen/rss/0,5291,,00.xml and http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/front_page/rss091.xml. Reverting to the version 1.5 cures the problem. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.repubblica.it/rss/homepage/rss2.0.xml
2. add as live bookmark to bookmarks toolbar folder
3. click on the RSS feed and open any link

Actual Results:  
The link will produce an error message from the Repubblica pages. When you analyse the link that the browser actually tried to open, you will see that it is actually the concatenation of a valid link with itself. Deleting the second half from the link gives the valid link. 



I have not done any checks with other RSS feeds.

Works in
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Doesn't work in
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060927 BonEcho/2.0 ID:2006092710

1. New profile
2. Bookmarks > Organise Bookmarks, File > New Live Bookmark
3. Use http://www.repubblica.it/rss/homepage/rss2.0.xml as feed URL
4. Click on a link in the feed. in 1.5 the link loads fine, in 2.0 (20060927) the link doesn't work because the URL is made from two valid URLs concatenated. (eg: http://www.somelink.com/storyhttp://www.somelink.com/story)

check to see if link is already populated

This regressed when title/link parsing was changed to catch carriage returns and multiple cdata sections in May 06.

check to see if linkStr and dateStr are empty
Isn't that going to choose <link> over <guid> if the <link> comes first? I'd think we would want to clear linkStr once we've decided it's a isPermaLink, rather than give up on <guid> if we already found a <link>.

Yes, but that should be the 1.5 behavior as well, right? Looking for the minimal fix at this point.
You're right, and Bugzilla's of the opinion that I completely imagined the bug where I thought that was fixed as a side effect of something Atom-related. Nevermind.

r=me, though I'm not sure why we'd check for the empty string first in one case, and last in another, but I don't know all of this code well enough to know the merits of the ordering
