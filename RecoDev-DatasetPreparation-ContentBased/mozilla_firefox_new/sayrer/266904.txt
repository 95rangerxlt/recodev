XML feeds that are defined in <link> tags and show up in the Firefox RSS button
menu in the bottom-right corner ("Subscribe to '..' ") keep adding up to produce
infinite duplicates when a page is set to refresh with <meta> tags AND the
meta-refreshing tab is not selected. When the tab is reloaded by hand OR
selected and refreshed by the meta-refresh, the list gets cleared correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox, open two tabs
2. In other tab go to http://www.rakkis.net/firefox-rssbutton-metareload-bug.html
3. Select any other tab
4. Wait 20 seconds.
5. Select the tab in which the first link was opened; you can now see that the
two RSS feeds defined in the site appear multiple times when you click on the
small RSS button to bring up the "Subscribe to '..' " menu. When you refresh the
page by hand, or wait another 10 seconds when the page is selected, the menu
gets cleared up correctly and only 2 feeds show up.
Actual Results:  
Multiple (duplicate) items of the two RSS feeds defined in the page HTML appear
in the RSS button menu.

Expected Results:  
The RSS button menu should clear every time the page is reloaded, so that only
two RSS feeds (as defined by the HTML) appear always there.

I now noticed that the same duplication happens if you right click on another
tab that has RSS feeds and click on "Reload tab", so that the tab gets reloaded
when it's not selected.
Or if you drag a link and drop it on a background tab: it's the same bug in any situation that loads a page in a tab in the background, because startDocumentLoad isn't called, and that's where the list of discovered feeds gets cleared.

You should use the "pagehide" event rather than "unload", otherwise this will still occur for background session history navigation (content-triggered history.back(), for example) when fastback is enabled.

r=me with that change.

requesting blocking 1.8.1.1 (or 1.8.1.2) -- landing bug 344022 on the branch without landing this bug caused a pretty major regression, where the feed icon isn't removed from the feed preview page.

verified existence of bug in 2.0.0.1 (1.8.1.1) by opening two tabs.  Opened news.yahoo.com in one tab.  Dragged it to the other tab.  Dragged it to the other tab again.  Clicked to other tab - saw duplicate rss entries.

rss icon entries are not duplicated in 2.0.0.2pre.
