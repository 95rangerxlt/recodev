We should track how often the eyedropper tool is opened with telemetry.
I'm working on this and have it working, but I'm still thinking about how to split up the histograms.

What I want to do is measure how often people open the picker from the button, menu, and color picker. Right now I have a separate measure for each of them:

"DEVTOOLS_BUTTON_EYEDROPPER_OPENED_BOOLEAN"
"DEVTOOLS_BUTTON_EYEDROPPER_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG"

"DEVTOOLS_PICKER_EYEDROPPER_OPENED_BOOLEAN"
"DEVTOOLS_PICKER_EYEDROPPER_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG"

"DEVTOOLS_MENU_EYEDROPPER_OPENED_BOOLEAN"
"DEVTOOLS_MENU_EYEDROPPER_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG"

Jeff, will this pollute the data too much? Should we have one measure for no matter how they open an eyedropper instance, or keep them separate like this and just add them up if we want to get a total measure?
Looks good to me to keep them separate, I think we can still sum them to get an overall impression of eyedropper use, at least for a while.

Add telemetry to eyedropper: button, color picker button, menu item

This patch adds telemetry to the eyedropper, with separate measures for if its opened via the toolbox button, color picker button, or devtools menu. It does not track how much time it's been open as this is an open-and-close kind of tool.

Perfect, r+ assuming we have a green try for this.
Gonna wait for bug 1098374 and rebase.
