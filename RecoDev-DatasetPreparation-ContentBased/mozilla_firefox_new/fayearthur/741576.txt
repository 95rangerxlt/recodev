We're making the computed view prettier in bug 735629, but in the meantime I suggest reducing the padding around each style property so you can scan more without scrolling and putting the search box on the left hand side to align with the properties.

Reduce padding and put search box on left

Patch for proposed tweaks.
For the toolbar holding the checkbox and the searchbox, could we use the devtools theme as well? Using class="devtools-toolbar" class="devtools-searchinput" should work (not sure if it should be part of this bug, and if it even looks good)

Here's a screenshot with those two classes applied too.

We can do the dark themeing of the toolbar in a separate bug.

I mentioned this on IRC but so it's not forgotten: the test depends on the order of elements - it's checking that pressing <tab> from the search field moves focus to the style checkbox. Since those got reordered, the test needs to be updated to match (could probably just add a shift modifier to the keypress at https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleinspector/test/browser_bug589375_keybindings.js#71)

patch with updated test

Thanks Paul for the note!

I updated the test, and it's passing on try server now.

Heather, my guess it that the SynthetizeMouse call fails:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleinspector/test/browser_styleinspector_bug_672744_search_filter.js#51

The CSS change might be the problem here (s/5,5/2,2/ might solve the problem).

It does look like the synthesizeMouse() call is failing. I tried 2,2 and 8,8 but the test still fails.

tweak styles to lessen horizontal scrolling

Okay, sod switching the search box and check box for now.

This patch tweaks the computed table to take up less room and reduce horizontal scrolling, it:

* reduces the font size of property names.
* makes property names <td>s so names are broken up if they're too long.
* reduces some padding/margin between rows and after expanders.

It will still scroll if you make the sidebar too small, and it's not a complete overhaul of the UI, but I think it's a good fix for now.

Tests pass on try server.

Optional: maybe you want to remove some padding/margin around the twisty. Up to you.

That would be nice. -moz-apperance: treetwisty was too magic for me to figure out what was going on immediately, maybe a follow-up?

Yep.

Let's land that.
