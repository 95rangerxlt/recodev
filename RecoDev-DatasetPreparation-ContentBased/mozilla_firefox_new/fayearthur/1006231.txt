Right now the Style Editor fetches the content of the original source from its resolved location. We should be getting the content from the `sourcesContent` property of the source map, if it exists.

The debugger does this already. We should really share some of this code at some point.

Look at 'sourcesContent' before fetching, add test for self contained sourcemap

Small fix. Also refactored the source maps test and added a test for a self contained sourcemap in a data url.

Fixed a "TypeError: this.rawSheet.ownerNode.ownerDocument.location is null" that was cropping up when I ran the test.

Heather, should I mark this as being in-testsuite? You mentioned it has tests but didn't flag it.
It does have tests, yes.


Style Editor should load original source's content from the map's `sourcesContent` if it exists
