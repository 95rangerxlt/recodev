I thought I had filed this previously, but I can't find the bug now.

The Style Editor prettifies style sheets automatically. However, the heuristic it uses to determine whether a style sheet *needs* to be prettified is too conservative. It works for github.com (which was Cedric's test case), but it doesn't work in many other places I've looked.

gmail has a newline at the beginning.
cnn.com has 23 lines
WordPress admin interface has 2 lines (and a blank line at the end)

Pretty print even with spaces and newlines at the end of the file

It turns out that we bail on pretty printing if there's any whitespace after a "{", ";", or "{".

This patch will allow any amount of whitespace at the end of a file (it already allows any amount at the beginning), so http://github.com works now. It also allows spaces as I'm seeing files with spaces after rules not newlines, that aren't being pretty printed (http://gmail.com).

It reenables the pretty printing test that was disabled in bug 942473. I'm going to run try to see what happens there: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=8a17c95eeb8d
One thought - Like debugger, we might also want to provide an option to disable this feature. One of the most useful feature of Style Editor is that you can modify the CSS file, see the live changes, get to a satisfactory result and then *save it back to disk* replacing the original file that was loaded earlier. I might not want to mess up with already existing formatting over the whole file for a couple of line changes.

Is this actually used? Maybe you inlined it and forgot to take it out?

Assuming this was fixed by your recent intermittent fix, right?

So weird, the patch has it, but the Review doesn't show it. I add a <link> to the minified.html.

CSS source maps landed after that, which changed the code a good bit. Unfortunately the logs in bug 942473 have expired and I can't reproduce the problem locally or on try. So I'm hoping it's fixed now. If not then we can take another look.

Also that's intermittent to the tune of caused-by-proton-decay.
Like, happened only once. Ever.

Many style sheets are not prettified / deobfuscated automatically
