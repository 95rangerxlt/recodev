The following remote events sent by a StyleSheet actor are postfixed by the actor id of the stylesheet they were sent from:

styleApplied-<id>
sourceLoad-<id>
error-<id>
propertyChange-<id>

The actor's id is already sent in the "from" property, so this is redundant. This is a leaky abstraction, and was used to easily listen to only events from a particular actor, but it should really be up to the client to use the "from" property to achieve that.

This is incongruous with other devtools actors, so we should change it.

Remove id postfix from event names, remove "error" event

I *really* want to convert the Style Editor to use protocol.js, but I want these breaking changes in sooner.

This removes the "-id" from the events listed in c#1, and also removes the "error" event, which was only fired when there was an error fetching stylesheet source, and was much better suited as a property on the "sourceLoad" event.
