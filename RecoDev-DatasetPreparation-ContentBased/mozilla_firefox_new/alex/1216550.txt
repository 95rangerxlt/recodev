That ends up preventing opening a toolbox more than once against the same app/tab/target.
This typically ends up in a broken, zombie toolbox that you can't close in WebIDE.

Stealing this review from jryans, but looks good! Is this something that needs uplifted?
Not a big deal as it's not a very common pattern (opening a toolbox more than once against the same app)
But that may prevent some broken toolbox in webide if this LegacyProfilerFront is already in aurora.
"Nice to have" for Aurora I'd say. :)
