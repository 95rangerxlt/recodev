When using the webapps actor to push an app multiple times,
all information like app name, descriptions, ... aren't updated after the first install. You have to reboot your phone or uninstall and reinstall the app to get these data updated.

We already fixed that in the simulator, it is only about uplifting the fix and get it tested.

Uplift simulator's patch with an additional xpcshell test

I think that webapp actor tests have been disabled with the removal of the big xpcshell tests ini file :(
I say that because I had to modify the promise library import to make it work locally on b2g desktop tests.

I believe you are right, the latest fx-team build in tbpl doesn't contain apps unit tests. I don't see however how the change you made to promises will be useful. I made this change in bug 885318 and now everything in devtools imports the sdk promise library using a lowercase promise variable identifier. Why is reversing this change necessary?

TBH, I have no clear idea why I had to modify the promise requirement. I'm used to see weird issues on b2g cu.import behavior, so I just made a random modification of import statement and that one works. Would it be the only one test run on b2g?
Or may be my build is somehow broken and I need to clobber?
Looks like it is broken on b2g, I'm seeing this exception on a master build:
[JavaScript Error: "ReferenceError: promise is not defined wa_actorGetAll@resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-server.jsm -> resource://gre/modules/devtools/server/actors/webapps.js:302

Fix promise related exception in webapps actor.

The issue was really simple, the bad thing, we don't have unit test covering b2g remote debugging :(

Manifest properties aren't updated when installing apps multiple times

New patch, with only the fix.

Convert webapps xpcshell test to mochitest-plain and cover app reinstall and redirects manifest property

I moved the tests to another patch as it is bigger than exception.
I ended up being stuck in xpcshell, there was no way to test it sanely with just a docshell.
So I converted piece of xpcshell to mochitest and added test for this (app updating)
and also a better test for redirects.
