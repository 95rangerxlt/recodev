By default, we automatically open toolbox for the last debugged app.
The toolbox correctly appear and works, but if you happen to select the same app in the sidebar of runtime apps, it will destroy the toolbox and try to reopen a new one. But it ends up breaking and you end up with a broken toolbox that you can't close!

The issues comes from this code:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/webide/modules/app-manager.js?force=1#368
It happens that the new project object comes with an `icon` whereas the object set during auto-selection doesn't.
