Once bug 1007061 lands, there will still be some resource in /devtools/app-manager/, files being still used by WebIDE.
We should integrate them into WebIDE folders or get rid of these deps.

patch v2

Also includes some require(Services) / require(promise) cleanups
as well as some removal of app-manager references.
(that are not about the webide/modules/app-manager module!)

I also tried to clean bugzilla from some app-manager bugs/references.

I believe this will cause all the strings to be re-translated... not sure it's worth it?  On the other hand, it's probably left untranslated in many locales.  I leave it up to you.
