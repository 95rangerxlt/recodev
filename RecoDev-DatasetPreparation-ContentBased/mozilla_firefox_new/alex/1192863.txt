As bug 1190452 with dbg-server.jsm, we need to import DebuggerClient via require instead of Cu.import, that, to be able to reload devtools codebase.

rename dbg-client.jsm to client.js

This patch is just to help reviewing the second one,
in order to highlight the modification I made
in order to be able to load this file as a jetpack module.

convert to commonjs module - v1

A first try with some failure, but running on various platform (esp b2g to check scope issues)
  https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=92e39a0bf827
And a new one with additional fixes that should be green:
  https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=2d4278c2855e

I cleaned up client.js header with all the imports.
We no longer need to bind exported symbols on `this`
(only jsm scope is broken on b2g, not commonjs modules).
I no longer import transport from client.js,
but only from dbg-client.jsm as there is no usage of
DebuggerTransport from client.js.
Also I no longer load transport.js via subscriptloader,
but as a regular module.
And finally, I want to highlight that we used to do Cu.import(deprecated-sync-thenables)
without the second parameter that is often `{}`.
That happen to mess up with all sandboxes global scope :x

I'll try to get rid of all Cu.import usages without a second argument.
That can bring very unexpected behavior.
Here it overloaded `Promise` symbol for all sandboxes :/

It looks like `dumpn` and `dumpv` aren't used in this file and should be removed?

I believe they were only here to support `transport.js` which used to get them here when loaded via `loadSubScript`, but it now uses `DevToolsUtils` for them, so I believe they are not used by anyone now.  This does cause the transport's logging prefix to always be "DBG-SERVER" even when logging for the client instead of "DBG-CLIENT", which has made me sad for a while...  anyway it's not caused by your changes. :) Some day we'll use a nice logging system.

Does it make sense to call the file "main.js" to match "server/main"?  Just an idea, whichever sounds best to you is fine.

Yes. I had the same idea while writing this patch. So it is now named client/main.js.

use commonjs module instead of jsm - v1

And here is the patch to actually stop using the JSM
in favor of the new commonjs module.
As for dbg-server.jsm, I'm not dropping dbg-client.jsm
as it is used by too many addons.
