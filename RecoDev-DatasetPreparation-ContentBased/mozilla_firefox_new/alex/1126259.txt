The removal of the unload event handler in gDataNotificationInfoBar.init (see browser/base/content/browser-data-submission-info-bar.js) is broken, because the function added as the event listener is different from the function passed to removeEventListener ('function onUnload() {...}.bind(this)' vs. 'unUnload'). We can just remove the broken removeEventListener call, because it's not needed.
