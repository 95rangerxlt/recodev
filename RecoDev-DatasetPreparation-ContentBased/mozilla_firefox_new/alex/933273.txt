Per bug 899052 comment 32, we can see that the AddonManager is loaded everytime we load the webbrowser actor. That is totally unexpected on b2g as the addon manager isn't supposed to be instaciated on device and it will use a bunch of memory for nothing.

[Triage Comment]
also approving for aurora (27) uplift since we'll want to cover the bases there, assuming you can land this there as-is.
