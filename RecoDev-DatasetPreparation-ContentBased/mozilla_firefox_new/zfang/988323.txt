Should not require any new graphic assets (PNGs) as they already exist in the build.

A plan to supplement our Tabs From Other Devices InContent page with an Australis-friendly menu item. Comments appreciated, and the deck includes questions about desktop notifications, and sync tabs recency. Will be linked to a meta bug which tracks related bugs.
Broken down to two engineering bug:

Bug 996638 - Implement "Synced Tabs" button in Menu Panel 
Bug 1024650 - Implement doorhanger notification for Synced Tab
FWIW 'Synced Tabs' in is actually 'Synchronisierte Tabs' in German, so even longer.
