It's unfortunate I have to use a cpow here for the title but I'm not seeing another way to get that in the parent. Even if this isn't optimal, I think its a good work around for nav bar shortcut drags.

Found something better for title - browser.contentTitle.

Just use:
let value = gBrowser.currentURI.spec;
let urlString = value + "\n" + gBrowser.contentTitle;
