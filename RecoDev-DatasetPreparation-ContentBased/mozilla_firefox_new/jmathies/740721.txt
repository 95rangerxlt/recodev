This could be in widget or something higher up. We added touch input support back when win7 was released, this seems to have broken.

STR:

1) open a web page on the desktop
2) pinch or zoom the page

result: nothing happen.

Please use ifdef instead of ifndef, swapping these two sections. Can you also add a comment explaining why this varies across OSes?

This change enables functionality we mistakenly disabled about a year ago for windows touch input displays. Unfortunately once disabled, it stays disabled unless the user manually edits config settings.

Microsoft will have a fresh preview release of win8 due out in the next few weeks, so I would like to get this out to beta in the hope that this functionality will be available for fresh installs on the new os rev.

This is too late for FF13, but appears to be low risk enough to approve for Aurora 14.
