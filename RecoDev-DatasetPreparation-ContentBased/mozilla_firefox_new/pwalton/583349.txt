[checked-in] Proposed patch.

The input line provides no indication to the user of what it's for. This patch adds a prompt icon.

Because this is an important UI feature, I'd like to request blocking status for Firefox 4 betaN.

Given that this image appears to be the same across platforms, you could just use the ../../winstripe/ trick used earlier in this file to only have to add the file once.

If you have an issue with the code or functionality, please file a separate bug rather than griping in this one. Thanks.
