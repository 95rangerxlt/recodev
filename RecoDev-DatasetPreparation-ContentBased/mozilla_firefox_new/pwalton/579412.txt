When you open up the HUD/Console, the inputNode is not focused.

The inputNode should be focused to increate the workflow.

Requesting approval as this patch improves the UX for the WebConsole. Instead of opening the WebConsole and setting the focus to the inputNode to start typing/testing thing the focus is set to the inputNode automatically when the WebConsole is opened. This one step less to do speeds up development/testing for the WebConsole also.

New proposed patch.

New patch. The "jsterm" property is only defined immediately after the console is created, which was causing the test failures. Mochitests now pass.

FWIW, querySelectorAll(x)[0] == querySelector(x), and the latter could be a little more efficient.
I was thinking the same thing as above in Comment 11. Otherwise, this is checked in so it should be a follow-up bug.
