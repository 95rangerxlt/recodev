Patch.

The Console filters should be divided into two categories: "Firefox" and "Console API". This eliminates the confusion that can result from having both "Exception" and "Error" in the filter bar, and it also makes the filter bar slightly less visually overwhelming.

The attached patch implements this by making these changes:
(1) Now, as the Console is created, the buttons are grouped into the "Firefox" or "Console API" as appropriate.
(2) The buttons have been renamed to "Net", "CSS", "JS" (Firefox), "Errors", "Warnings", "Info", and "Log" (Console API). The localization identifiers have been changed as well.

This patch is part of the Firefox 4 Console UI. The current UI for the console
is simply a placeholder and has not yet been designed from a UX perspective
(see bug 559481). Because I am requesting blocking status for the Console UI,
and this is a critical part of the Console user experience, I am requesting
that this bug block the Firefox 4 release as well.

Patch.

Good first pass on the UI re-org.

Proposed patch (trunk rebase 2010-07-26)

New patch applies cleanly against trunk. The only change was the removal of my name from the header (so I assume this is still feedback+). Review requested.

I think the tooltips may never have worked, so we shoudl figure that out in a followup bug.
Of course this may patch may need rebasing as well.
We should change the reviewer here, since Gavin will be away next week.

Screenshot attached. This does not show the final styling, but it should be enough to get the gist of this change.

Proposed patch (trunk rebase 2010-08-05).

Rebased the patch to trunk.
This is good polish, but not a blocker.

The distinction makes sense. However:

1) I think the visual separation should be stronger. At a glance, it looks like a checkbox with a label on either side. Put emphasis on the group label text and add a colon? Or use some other visual approach like full-height separators? #ux might have ideas.

2) The text is not right. I think "Firefox" is not ideal because it's the web page that is the real source that the developer is working with. And "Console API" could be shortened to just "Console".

Well, this was part 1 of the patch: part 2 would add the styling. Sorry for not making this clear.

Yeah, I wrestled with choosing the right text for this. I'm fine with "Page" instead of "Firefox". But I thought "Console" would be a little confusing because it could also refer to the Web Console itself. I'm not particularly happy with "Console API", but I couldn't come up with anything better.

Maybe simply:
console.  [ ] error()  [ ] warn()  [ ] info()  [ ] log()
Note that "Console API" is the name that Firebug (which originated the API) uses: http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API

[checked-in] Proposed patch, version 2.

Patch version 2 renames the categories to "Page" and "Console", and makes the categories look OS-native, with styles based on the Quick Filter Bar in Thunderbird.
