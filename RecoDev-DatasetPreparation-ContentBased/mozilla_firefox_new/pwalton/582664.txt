The only way to access the developer tools in Windows is to either (a) turn on the menu by right-clicking or (b) use the keyboard shortcuts. This hurts discoverability, which is particularly important for the beta audience. For this reason I'm proposing that this block betaN.

I'd like to propose adding a "Developer >" submenu to the "Firefox" button on Windows. Chrome has a "Tools" menu that contains, among other things, View Source, the JavaScript Console, and the Developer Tools. We could add the Web Console, the Inspector, and the View Source option to our "Developer" submenu.

seconded. I think we talked about this during one of our meetings this week and I think it'd be a solid addition to the button menu and aid in discoverability on windows.

Proposed patch.

Patch to implement this attached. It adds a "Developer >" submenu (which contains View Source, Inspect, and Web Console) below the "History >" menu and above the Customize menu. Tested on try server.

Yup, having this in a Developer menu was indeed the plan. There are some tweaks we have to do to the menu in general soon, but I think this can land in the meantime.

Add |id="appmenu_developer_popup"| here. Mostly just so extensions can easily get ahold of it.


>+            <menuitem id="appmenu_pageSource"

>+                      command="View:PageSource"/>

Hmm, I was going to r- because the 3 menuitems added here do not have accesskey set, but I see that none of the appmenu entries have accesskeys.

Dao, why's that? Because it's assumed that the appmenu will be mouse-driven, and that keyboard users will be using the traditional menu structure?


>+<!ENTITY developerMenu.label "Developer">

Hmm, I almost wonder if this should this be "Develop" to fit into the traditional verb-oriented menu labels, but that sounds really awkward.

Yes.

Why is there a separator between Page Source and Inspect?

I added that because Page Source is under "View" in the standard menus, while "Inspect" and "Web Console" are under "Tools".

The menu item should say "Developer Tools". No need to file a bug for it, so I'm commenting here.
Er, I managed to check in the wrong version of the patch.

The tree's closed right now, though.

Should this be re-resolved as fixed then?
Another thing - the access keys aren't displayed.(ctrl+shift+k, ctrl+shift+i)
Ctrl+Shift+U would fit for Page Source.


Developer Tools are not accessible from the app button in Windows
