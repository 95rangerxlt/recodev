Patch.

In the Console, there are two paths in constructing message objects: the HUDConsole() constructor and the createLogNode() method of the HUDService object. One of them sets a field called "timeStamp", while the other chooses "timestamp". "timeStamp" is an identifier used nowhere else in the file.

It will simplify the header code slightly to use one identifier in all places. The attached patch fixes this.

Requesting approval for Fx4.

Justification of approval: Headers for the Console are part of the UI for the Console, bug 559481. I am requesting blocking status for Firefox 4 for the Console UI.
When requesting blocking please provide an explanation of the user impact of the bug.
This bug is not blocking. I can work around it. However, the UI is blocking, so I am requesting approval for this bug to simplify the UI code I'm about to write.
