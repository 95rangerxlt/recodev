Proposed patch.

In the Web Console, the Clear Console button takes up a large amount of screen real estate and slightly clutters the interface. It's also an infrequently-used action, especially if we have headers to help developers visually categorize their messages (bug 580400). So I suggest moving it to a context menu.

The attached patch implements this. Requesting approval for Firefox 4.

Won't this make the clear functionality less discoverable?
Yes, but I think it's rare enough that the tradeoff in discoverability versus clutter reduction makes it worth it. The alternative would be to move the clear button to the bottom right.

Proposed patch.

I don't have strong opinions either way, but right-click is a fine way to do this â€” if possible, it would also be nice to support the keyboard shortcut that terminals use to do this (Ctrl/Cmd-K), but since it's already assigned to a function in FF, it might be hard to selectively override it here.

In any case, I'm fine with either approach, as long as the console can be cleared easily. :)
this conflicts now that bug 574036 has landed. Doesn't apply cleanly.

Rebased to trunk. I'm requesting rereview because the patch is significantly different from the older iteration now that bug 574036 has landed.

postmortem review nit: the clear menuitem should not have buttonType="clear", but something like id="hud-clear".
