Proposed patch.

Currently, the Web Console (headsUpDisplay.css) has no theme for Linux. Rather it uses the Windows one. This will be a problem for the close button (bug 581231).

The attached patch fixes this.

New patch fixes the copyright header, sorry about that.
You can |hg cp| the theme file to preserve its history (and make the patch easier to review).

[checked-in] Proposed patch (trunk rebase 2010-08-10).

Rebased to trunk. Only issue was that my name was already added to the file credits, so I assume this doesn't need re-review?

backed out in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5f699108f3cf

I'm almost certain it's not the cause of any leaks or CSS regressions: it's just copying one file from winstripe/ to gnomestripe/.
