Rather than exposing this on the generic bookmarks API, it would make sense to delegate the readonly property to nsIBookmarksContainer.  That way, for example, we can avoid storing readonly state for every single livemark folder and instead just have livemark folders always be readonly.

Is this function called on folders that aren't containers?  If so, shouldn't you set *aResult to PR_FALSE and return NS_OK if there is no folder type?

Otherwise, looks good.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
