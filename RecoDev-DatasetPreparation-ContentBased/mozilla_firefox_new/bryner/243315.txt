Build:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-05-11-08-trunk/firefox-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz

After untarring the latest Firefox GTK2+Xft non-installer build, I run firefox
from the console, and nothing happens. I just get this:

[aebrahim@palevsky-223-084 firefox]$ firefox
[aebrahim@palevsky-223-084 firefox]$

No segfault, no nothing. If I start it up using firefox -P, then it does start
up the profile manager, so it's clearly loading something. But normal startup
does nothing.

Acutally, I take that back. firefox -P doesn't do anything either. I was testing
the wrong install when I tried -P.
I'm seeing this too.  No go.  Marking blocker since it's not possible to test
the nightly firefox builds.
Does the nightly have a libxremoteservice.so in the components directory?

No.
When calling the firefox-bin directly the following error is received:

./firefox-bin: relocation error: ./firefox-bin: undefined symbol:
_ZN12nsCharTraitsIcE12sEmptyBufferE

REOPEN
Tested this with todays trunk gtk2+xft 16th May, and it would not start,
however.. I disabled one of my extensions "User agent switcher 0.31" and the
build started ok.. Related I wonder?
Will try this on other builds during the week..

I use a custom Linux build that also breaks with the User Agent Switcher
extension. I believe the extension is at fault here.
I just updated to 17/05 nightly and Firefox does not start for me as well. Running firefox-bin 
from the console I get: 
 
# /opt/firefox/firefox-bin 
/opt/firefox/firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libmozjs.so: cannot open shared 
object file: No such file or directory

Actually I take it back. Running it from the console, but with /opt/firefox as current directory it 
just disappears without any error.

Ok, I will get rid of that extension for the time being whilst testing, still no
luck booting with todays trunk 17th May.

Per suggestion from here:

Deleting components/compreg.dat seems to fix the problem. However, it then spews
out the following error on the console:

[aebrahim@palevsky-223-084 aebrahim]$ firefox
nsNativeComponentLoader: SelfRegisterDll(libnegotiateauth.so) Load FAILED with
error: libcom_err.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or

file:///home/aebrahim/firefox/components/nsExtensionManager.js ::
ensureExtensionsFiles :: line 217"  data: no]

The error is non-fatal, and Firefox continues to run okay. However, the
installer version does not spew out this error.

Seems that if the running user has write access to the components folder, the
compreg.dat file will be rebuilt on the next browser launch.

Yes, but the rebuilt compreg.dat does not cause the browser to fail launching.
It seems to works fine.

I never indicated that it caused the browser to fail launching.  In fact I was
attempting to indicate that if the user had write permissions to the components
directory that the error reported by Ali Ebrahim would also be corrected.

Perhaps I should have been more clear.
Build:
http://ftp.scarlet.be/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-05-20-15-trunk/firefox-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz

Works now for me. Previous attempts with builds around 14/05 failed with the
below error. Is this fixed?

./firefox-bin: relocation error: ./firefox-bin: undefined symbol:
_ZN12nsCharTraitsIcE12sEmptyBufferE
OK just tested Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a2) Gecko/20040521 
Firefox/0.8.0+ installer and normal version and both started fine and I used my 
original profile. 
However none of my extensions/themes where seen, but installing the 
extensions/themes again seems to work OK, but to be sure I will create a 
new .firefox.  
Also "help contents" is missing from the installer build.. 
Startup is fine for me (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a2)
Gecko/20040525 Firefox/0.8.0+), using my normal profile and a few extensions
(Adblock, SessionSaver, Linky, mozex, SmartSearch, editCSS). Some extensions
aren't working however (context menu items missing for Linky, mozex,
SmartSearch, editCSS), Adblock works, SessionSaver doesn't. Will try to
re-install those add-ons.
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a2) Gecko/20040526 
Firefox/0.8.0+ 
 
I built my own custom build, and if I go to Tools->Options and switch between 
the different tabs firefox eventually Segfaults, every time.  I'm using GCC 
3.4.0 
I can no longer reproduce this bug using the following build:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-05-26-08-trunk/firefox-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz

Am closing this, since comment 26 and comment 27 also can no longer reproduce.
This appears to have started happening again with the latest nightlies.

Using:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2004-06-01-08-trunk/firefox-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz

$ /usr/local/firefox/firefox-bin 
/usr/local/firefox/firefox-bin: relocation error:
/usr/local/firefox/firefox-bin: undefined symbol:
_ZN12nsCharTraitsIcE12sEmptyBufferE

Removal of the compreg.dat file no longer has any effect on the error.
Recent return of this problem on my system appears to have been due to my
nightly upgrade script... sorry for the false alarm.  All is well now.
