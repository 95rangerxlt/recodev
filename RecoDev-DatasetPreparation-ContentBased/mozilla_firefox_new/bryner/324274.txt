Tracking bug for merging Places (and its dependencies) to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH for Firefox 2.
Marking dependencies for required changes _other_ than landing browser/components/places and appropriate makefile ifdefs.

Merging sqlite to the current trunk version is also part of this, though I couldn't find a bug number for that checkin.

this is done, closing.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
