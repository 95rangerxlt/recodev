Video - scenario (B) - New Tab's height doesn't update the same moment when I delete extra tiles or choose 'show blank page'.webm

STR:   (Win7_64bit, Nightly 43.0a1 32bit   ID 20150828030205, new profile)

[There's 2 scenarios: (A) and (B). Watch video to see scenario (B) ]

0.   Open New Tab, click Gear button, uncheck "Include suggested sites". Adjust the window's height so that only 4 tiles in a row were visible, and only 2 or 1 rows were fully visible.
1. Fill all visible tiles on New Tab +1 tile. If you already have enough sites there to cause
   overflow, then skip this step.
  1.1. Open attached page, click textarea, press Ctrl+A to select all text, press Ctrl+C to copy
  1.2. Press Ctrl+B to open bookmarks, click "Bookmarks Menu", press Ctrl+V to create bookmarks
  1.3. Right-click "Bookmarks Menu", click "Open all in tabs" menuitem.
2.   Open New Tab, make sure that there's overflow on New Tab (vertical scrollbar is visible)
3.A) Click Gear button, select "Show blank page"
3.B) Delete extra tiles, so that the existing tabs were fully visible (that means that
     there should be no overflow according to bug 1194895)
4.   Click "New tab" button/press Ctrl+T to open new tab
5.   Repeat Step 4.

Result:       After Step 4 scrollbar is still visible. It disappears only after Step 5.
              If I set browser.newtab.preload -> true then scrollbar disappears after Step 4.
Expectations: Scrollbar should disappear after Step 3.

v1.  Make gGrid.refresh() also resize

A minor change in grid refresh logic.  Olivier and Tim to validate that it's OK to land in nightly.  Changes are minor and should be easy to port to remove newtab.

v1.  Make gGrid.refresh() also resize

>   /**

is this._refresh defined anywhere?
Max, as you know, I would like to see all dev on the newtab page frozen, and any patches applied to the remote new tab page.  The exceptions should be rare and serious.  I don't have a good feeling for how serious this bug is.  oyiptong?
Doesn't look that serious, in that it is a cosmetic issue.

We certainly want to fix this bug, however as you say, it is a bug-fix to a feature that has been introduced when the newtab page should've been frozen.

Max: will it fix all scrollbar-related issues? I don't think that bug is acceptable for good UX.

I propose two solutions: we back out the parent change: bug 1194895 and implement scrollbars in the remote new tab page, or we fix this bug for good and port it over to the remote new tab page.

The status quo is a broken window that irks me.
also: once you rename refresh to _refreshGrid, that makes the new refresh function dead code, doesn't it?
ah pardon me: it is used in page.js
