Given that nearly every CSS style guide in existence recommends using lowercase hex color values, the Developer Tools color picker should display all hex color values as lowercase, and more importantly, *copy* them as lowercase. Every time I scan through my code, I know immediately when a color value was copied from the color picker, because it is all in uppercase.

Mind you, even the Inspector's "Rules" and "Computed" tabs display hex color values as all uppercase. Those should be changed, too.

Uppercase hex color values are tantamount to uppercase HTML tags. Those days are behind us.

For reference, here are just a few style guides recommending lowercase hex color values:

This is true - color hex values are displayed upper case in almost all the inspector utilities in Tools for both the Nightly and standard Firefox versions, including the color picker. Have uploaded a tarball of a couple of screenscaps showing this in action.

As part of as-authored I plan to make this case-preserving.
Additionally, I think switching the default to lower case wouldn't hurt.

These files are all my babies so it was nice to see these improvements.

All my fault for using .toUpperCase in css-color.js::hasAlpha().

Great job!
