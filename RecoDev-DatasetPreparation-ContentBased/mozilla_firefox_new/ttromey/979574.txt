Steps to reproduce:

Container have the line-height property set with the !important modifier.
The child have the line-height property set without modifiers.

http://jsfiddle.net/cWLF7/


Actual results:

Firebug strikes child's line-height property as overriden. Parent's property is not striked.
However, child's line-height is actually used, and changing parent's property in the Firebug don't affect on text positioning.


Expected results:

Parent's !important property is used as having the highest priority.

Unfortunately, your expected result doesn't match what the CSS spec says to do, or the behavior of any browser.  !important only affects what the specified value is, and hence the computed value.  That's what gets inherited if the child inherits at all, but if the child has a different specified value it doesn't matter what was specified on the parent.

Sounds like a bug in Firebug...
Though I just checked, and Firebug does not in fact strike out the "line-height: 3px;" bit, or in fact anything in its style view that I can see...
This is an issue in which the built in developer tools (not Firebug) are showing the wrong property as being active in the rule view.
I believe this is happening due to the markOverridden function being too aggressive: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleinspector/rule-view.js#328.  It should be checking to make sure the property is not inherited before marking the earlier as overridden.  Even nicer would be if the getApplied() call from the style actor knew which properties would be overridden.

Easy test case - inspect the span on this page:

data:text/html,<style type="text/css">div{line-height: 1.25!important; } span {line-height: 1}</style><div><span>hi</span></div>

Took me a while to step through all the conditions in markOverridden.. Feel like that's some information that we should be able to fetch from the platform  more reliably than computing it all ourselves.  r+ though assuming all other tests are green, and I'd say let's ship it ASAP

If you use margin instead of background-color this patch could be landed now, independently from the as-authored series
