User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20151103004217

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using Firefox developer version, in Firefox normal version 41 don't have this issue.
Step - 1: Open one page.
Step - 2: Open Inspector to check the CSS.


Actual results:

If there is empty CSS in code, like a{}, the Inspector will parse wrong, like attachement black part, and it will make Firefox very slow.


Expected results:

The correct CSS will show like attachement light part.

change getRuleText to handle token-less rules

Test was slightly incorrect, sigh.
Very mysterious how I didn't catch this.

change getRuleText to handle token-less rules

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: 984880
[User impact if declined]:
This is a regression caused by the as-authored feature.
The bug is that the rule view will show some nonsense if a user's
style sheet happens to have a rule with an empty body, like "div {}".

[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
There's a new test for the change.
[Risks and why]: 
Very low risk, which I think can be seen by reading the patch.
Essentially it avoids a substring call in the case where the
end argument would be undefined.

[String/UUID change made/needed]: No.
I will wait for this land on Nightly before approving Aurora uplift request. Otherwise looks good to me.

Yan, could you please verify this issue is fixed as expected on the latest Nightly build? Thanks!
