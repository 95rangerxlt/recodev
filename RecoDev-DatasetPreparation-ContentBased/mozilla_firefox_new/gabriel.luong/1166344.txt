Try searching in the rules view for: "background-color: #F3F3F3"
Nothing matches

Good find!  As discussed, I'd like to move the DOM traversal elsewhere and store this as a property we can reference directly on the computed object. Either immediately after where the output parser called, or as a getter created when the computed object is created.  Whatever you think is better

It was better to store the parsed value in updateComputed to account for when the computed list is updated from a property change.

Nice!  Please update the commit message to say what the patch is doing instead of restating the problem
