console.table() an array of more than 10 things, then sort by their index by clicking on the first column in the output. You'll see:

0
1
10
2
3
...

It's sorting lexicographically. We should sort this column numerically.

Gabriel, I think you already had a patch for this. If you do, can you upload it and flag for review? Otherwise no worries.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: 1062490
[User impact if declined]: The index column for console.table() will be sorted incorrectly. This makes it appear as if console.table() is a WIP and not a completed feature.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: Green try, minor changes to the test of indices in the previous tests which resulted in converting the string numeric values to actual integers.
[Risks and why]: None
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
