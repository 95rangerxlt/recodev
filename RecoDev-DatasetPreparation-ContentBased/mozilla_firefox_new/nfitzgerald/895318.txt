Don't have a windows box with me to test it out, but this is the fix recommended by Optimizer, based on what he has done before in the timeline addon.

Based on the fact that if it works for my add-on, it should work here too :)
(Although it will be night before I can actually test it and see if it works)

I would've used border: none, but ok.
Will wait till someone can verify before landing.
I confirm, this fixes the issue.

Re-opening because this got backed out when the first black boxes UI stuff got backed out of fx-team. This change wasn't actually merged to m-c.
