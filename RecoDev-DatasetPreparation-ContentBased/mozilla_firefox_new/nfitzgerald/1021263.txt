FWIW it used to be called as part of setBreakpoint, but during some debugging session it must have been left aside instead of fixed directly. My plan was to fix/update it and make all the protocol requests that use that pattern call that instead (setBreakpoint, pauseOnExceptions, pauseOnDOMEvents). I still don't have the time to do that though, so if you are in a hurry just delete it.

Would prefer to just delete for now and if you get to those changes, there is always version control and this patch to help you get it back ;)
