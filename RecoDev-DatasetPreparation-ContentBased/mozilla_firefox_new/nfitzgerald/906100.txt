A manual bisection pointed to bug 890555 as the regressor. This is a blocker for getting our tests to run, as this is the last failure turning them orange.

Looked into the full log a bit.

We should get three sources: http://example.com/www/js/a.js, http://example.com/www/js/b.js, and http://example.com/www/js/c.js, but in fact we are getting a fourth source "/builds/slave/test/build/tests/xpcshell/tests/toolkit/devtools/server/tests/unit/head_dbg.js". Because it isn't one of our mocked sources, it doesn't have the expected source content ("content for " + url; see line 81).

What I *think* might be happening is that the Debugger.Script created by the evalInSandbox call inside addTestGlobal hasn't been gc'd yet, and so we create a source for head_dbg.js. I think we have hit this before, and have added manual calls to force gc before we start testing stuff. I think perhaps a better solution than calling that all over the place, would be to do it in addTestGlobal.
Yeah, Pretty sure this is the gc thing cropping up again: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/tests/unit/test_listsources-02.js#29

This actually has nothing to do with ASan, and you guys just happened to pick up this latent intermittent.

Confirmed to fix my problem on try, thanks :)
Just a note, but ae91affad44f (included in that push) was backed out for test failures. I am 99% sure my changes aren't causing that try push to be so sad, but I will push to try again in a minute.

Couldn't we just avoid GC-sensitivity altogether? Is that eval really needed?

Good catch, we don't really need to eval, so we can avoid the hack altogether.
