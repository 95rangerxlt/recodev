Thanks, Panos! Feels good to be back.

Just fixing a little typo s/Promise.deferred/Promise.defer/ and attacking Promise to imports so that it doesn't leak on to window.

New try push: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=73340bebc7b7
One thing to be aware of is that we generally try to conserve resources in the build infrastructure, so we only run tests that are affected by the patch. In this case you should be fine by just running the mochitest-bc and xpcshell tests.

Personal bias - I prefer leaving module names in because it makes subsequent code clearer (to me at least). It's slightly more verbose but you're not left wondering what 'reject' this is at a later date.

I'm guessing that this comment is broader than this file so you're free to ignore it.

Consider my chagrined. I have always just used the defaults when pushing to try. I will pay more attention in the future.

I don't feel particularly strongly about it either way. If you want me to remove the destructuring, I can.
