Allow backups of size zero in ZeroCopyNSIOutputStream::BackUp

Super small patch.

I saw this assertion failure while running some tests and it was
google::protobuf::GzipOutputStream on the stack above this, so I think it is
safe to say that all the other zero copy output streams work fine with
zero-sized backups.

You probably want to fix the message that goes with that assertion, too.
