There's a button in the Traces tab that reads "Start Tracing". After pressing that, there's no corresponding "Stop Tracing" in the tab.

Initially I had no idea how to stop tracing, because I missed the tracer button in the toolbar.

We should have a more consistent way of starting/stopping tracing. I vote for having a single button, either in the toolbar, or in the traces tab.

Moreover, once you stop tracing, the "Start Tracing" button in the sidebar never comes back. Confusing.
As I said in bug 949909, I think we should remove the "start tracing" button and only show the "tracing has not started" message and center that message in the pane.

Please file a bug about using the emptyText setter on the widget instead of providing this custom tracer message.
