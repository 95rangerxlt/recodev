Even though we don't plan on showing the list of breakpoints when their source is black boxed, if we already have breakpoints on a source, the eyeball is still not aligned properly.

This aligns the eyeball with the source, however we still have the blue bar on the left. I don't see how we can get rid of the blue bar on the left without mucking with the _target and the contents setter in nasty ways. It just doesn't seem like there is a good solution without refactoring a bunch of SideMenuWidget code. Or maybe I'm just not grooving with the whole Widgets stuff still. Suggestions wanted.

Review of attachment 780082:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The horizontal alignment is an easy fix, although the opposite of obvious. Here's a diff:

 .side-menu-widget-item-contents {
-  padding: 4px;
+  padding: 4px 0px;
 }

 .side-menu-widget-item-other {
   background: url(background-noise-toolbar.png), hsla(208,11%,27%, 0.65);
-  margin: 0 -4px;
-  -moz-padding-start: 5px;
+  -moz-margin-start: -22px;
 }

It doesn't completely remove the left blue bar because I think showing some of it actually looks pretty good. The 22px margin should be modified once the eyeball will be made smaller.

r+ with the above changes.
(that's in widgets.css)
