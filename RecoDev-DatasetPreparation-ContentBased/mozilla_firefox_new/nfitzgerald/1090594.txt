We used to do some backwards compat stuff with this abstraction, but it turned out not to be super helpful and we've since moved away from that towards just using traits on the hello packet. At the moment, nothing is using this layer, but every single packet gets routed through it. Let's kill it.

+1 for killing this.

Thanks for doing this. I'm always happy to see the client get simpler! :-)

I really like the idea of doing whitespace changes in a separate patch. Couldn't we make that an official policy somehow?

I could see this being frustrating for more complicated patch sets. In other words, its nice to make the judgement yourself.
