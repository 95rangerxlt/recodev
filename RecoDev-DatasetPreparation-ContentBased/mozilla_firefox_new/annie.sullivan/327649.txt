Opening the context menu for a menuitem inside of a places menupopup should set that menupopup's selection to the node associated with that menuitem.  This does not happen on Mac, causing context menu actions to affect the wrong resultnode.

Opening the context menu for a menuitem inside of a places menupopup should set that menupopup's selection to the node associated with that menuitem.  This does not happen on Mac, causing context menu actions to affect the wrong resultnode.
Is this because the ancestor menupopups receive the same event and so set the selection to them, if so then will the patch in bug 325781 fix that?
It turns out the menuitems aren't even supposed to have context menus on mac.  This was fixed in the patch for bug 327036.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
