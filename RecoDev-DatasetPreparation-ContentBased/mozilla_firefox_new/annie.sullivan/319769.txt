The annotation service RemoveAnnotation() function is not implemented.
There also needs to be convenience functions for getting and setting 64 bit ints to make it easier to set times with annotations.

You should pass PR_FALSE here -- there's no reason to add the URI to history if it doesn't exist already.  Then, just return early if the id is 0.

You should notify the observers here (OnAnnotationRemoved).

r=me with those fixed.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
