Currently when entering Australis customization mode, the menu panel appears as a plain rectangle to the right of the palette.

The spec calls for the panel to resemble its appearance for when it's opened in normal mode.

Blake:

You want to look at browser/base/content/browser.xul - particularly, the customization-panelHolder hbox.

What happens is that when we enter customization mode, we slurp out the main view in the panel, and plop it into that holder.

Style changes (if any) should go into browser/themes/windows/browser.css, browser/themes/linux/browser.css, browser/themes/osx/browser.css. Like we were taking though, if we could somehow share the panels' style (which are defined in /toolkit/themes/osx/global/popup.css, /toolkit/themes/windows/global/popup.css and /toolkit/themes/linux/global/popup.css, that'd probably be best).
Whoops - I made a mistake. I forgot to mention that customization-panelHolder is in an include - browser/base/content/customization.inc. This is included during pre-processing into browser.xul.

WIP patch 1.

So, this seems like a direction that could work…  What do you think, Mike?  Worth pursuing further?

Comments:

I moved the "Move the mainView in the panel" code earlier, because we want the whole populated menu to look as if it's animating in, and moving the things after transitionend looked really weird.

I have only fixed the padding for osx (in browser/themes/osx/browser.css), because I haven't tried building on other platforms.  I _suspect_ something similar will be needed there, but I'll do that when I fix the other problems you uncover with this patch.  :)

Thanks,
Blake.

This looks really, really good - and I'm pleased with how neatly we can just take the panel styling.

What is the padding for? Can you give me a screenshot showing what it fixes on OSX? I don't think we need it for Windows...

Can you show me a screenshot with this padding?

Oh, ok - I hadn't noticed that this was wanted (space between the right-side of the window and the panel).

Then yes, I think we should bring this padding over to the other platforms.
Looks good, can we experiment with positioning the panel to the right more so that the arrow still lines up with the button (overlapping some of the blue)?

That'd be removing the padding. I'm fine with trying this, so long as UX is too.

Is it really? The 'without padding' screenshot doesn't have the panel lined up well. Note that the panel would also have to be moved vertically up also.

Ohhhhh - I see - you want the panel over the grid.

No, I'm not opposed to trying that either, although this isn't part of the original prototype...

I don't think I feel too strongly either way - but if I was forced to choose, I'd choose to follow the prototype unless I hear otherwise from the UX team.

Patch v2

Adds padding to Linux and Windows themes.
I have a feeling we're not going to hear from the UX team, since they're at a work week.

I'm just going to land this, and we can file follow-up's if this really isn't exactly the way we want to roll.

This is a pretty nasty and fragile hack. This stylesheet is a scoped one and supposed to be used in anonymous content.

The anonid attributes are pointless.

Try this:

<vbox id="customization-panelWrapper">
  <html:style html:type="text/html" scoped="scoped">
    @import url(chrome://global/skin/popup.css);
  </html:style>
  ...
(you need to set xmlns:html on <window> first)

Dão, what's the significance of 'html:type="text/html"'? Should that have been text/css or is this a trick to preload the CSS?
That was probably just a typo.
