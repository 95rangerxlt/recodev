For users defined to be part of cells 2 - 5 (from bug 1029776), on installation:

- store the user's currently chosen search provider
  (actually this doesn't need to be stored since all users of these cells should have Google as the default)
- Set the provider to an alternate one, based on the cell
- On uninstallation, restore to default provider unless the user has manually switched to a 3rd one (exact details pending, see bug 1029260 comment 1).

Added to Iteration 33.2  Can you provide a point value and if the bug should be marked as [qa+] or [qa-] for verification
Fixed in https://hg.mozilla.org/users/felipc_gmail.com/search-experiment/rev/d1111fc9d266 and https://hg.mozilla.org/users/felipc_gmail.com/search-experiment/rev/eed27f13da00
As a note for the review, the TelemetryExperiments doesn't install stuff until sessionstore-state-finalized or EM-loaded.  So, if the search service initializes before that, we're safe.


[Search experiment] Set alternate search provider
