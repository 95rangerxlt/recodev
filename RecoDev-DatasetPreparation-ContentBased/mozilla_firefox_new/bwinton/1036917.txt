We would also like to tag Google-specific strings (eg site: define: and math).
This may be tricky, because of things like "webcal:" which (should) redirect to your calendar provider.

It might be easier to hook into the files changed in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8445128&action=diff and send the notifications from there.

This is being logged in FHR at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/services/healthreport/providers.jsm#1397, so it looks like we're good to go.  (And since it's existing functionality, it doesn't need more QA.)
(These bugs ended up being less work than I thought, and don't need QA.)


Log the number of searches being done from the url bar.
