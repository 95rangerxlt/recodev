Can we merge the changes in to bsmedberg's version?
Should we try spinning up a VM on paas.allizom.org?

(This bug also includes the work necessary to either get the changes merged or spin up the VM, thus 3 points.)

I have a strong preference for everyone to use the same tool if possible. I don't much care whether that's my hosted solution or a paas solution, as long as we import the existing data and do suitable redirects.

The parts of PAAS I couldn't figure out was how to do email handling and how to deploy the multipart webapp/cronjob/DB stuff.
I would love to have the changes get ported back to your hosted solution!

At the start of the next sprint, I'll send you a pull request for the buglist branch in my fork of the code, and then use the rest of the time to make whatever changes you want to get the code in a mergeable state.  :)

Thanks!
I don't think this is a qe-verify, since Benjamin will be making sure the changes work before he merges them, and we'll all be seeing it work (or not) when it goes live.  ;)
Perfect, thanks Blake.

I'm taking this for the current iteration.

Fixed, since https://github.com/bsmedberg/mozilla-weekly-updates/pull/12 was merged and https://github.com/bsmedberg/mozilla-weekly-updates/pull/15 was closed.


[UX] Figure out where to run the newly-designed status tool, and run it there.
