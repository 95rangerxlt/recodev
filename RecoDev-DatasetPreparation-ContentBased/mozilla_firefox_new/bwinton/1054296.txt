Note: This is planned to affect all teams using the status tool, not just the Firefox team.

To list the things that need doing that I know about so far:
* Add gravatars.
* Figure out where to put all the pieces of information we currently have.
* Pull in the colours/fonts/spacing, and however much of the layout makes sense.
* Use human-readable timestamps.  ;)
* Grey-out "older" status updates (possibly in a team-dependent way).
* Get the code merged into Benjamin's official repo.

I'm taking this for the current iteration.
Status update:
✔︎ Add gravatars.
✔︎ Use human-readable timestamps.  (Wow, that was annoying!)

* Pull in the colours/fonts/spacing, and however much of the layout makes sense.
* Figure out where to put all the pieces of information we currently have.
* Grey-out "older" status updates (possibly in a team-dependent way).

✖︎ Get the code merged into Benjamin's official repo. (will be done in bug 1054291)
Being reviewed at https://github.com/bsmedberg/mozilla-weekly-updates/pull/16
And it's been merged, so I'm going to resolve this fixed.  :)


[UX] Update the style of the status list to more closely match Darrin's tool.
