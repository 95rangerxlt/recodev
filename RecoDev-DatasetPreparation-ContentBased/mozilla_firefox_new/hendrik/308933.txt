makes the proposed change, fixes some other minor lay-out oddities as well

I've been so free as to add myself to the contributors, feel free to remove my
name again :-(

Anyway, makes the proposed change, also adds en <em> tag, removes a superfluous
</br> and some newlines.

Please drop the unrelated changes. We're trying to reduce the work of the
localization teams. We can make other changes in the trunk after 1.5 has been
released.

You should probably add "(replaced one word, and removed a couple of other
words)". ;-)

All we need is this part:
>-  <dt>Show File Location</dt>
>-  <dd>When a download has finished, the <strong>Show</strong> link will appear by the
>-    file entry.  Use it to open the folder where &brandShortName; saved the file.</dd>

removed my `additional changes'

Ok then.

Though I think the other changes would be useful as well.  I don't really see
what the problem would be to only remove empty lines.  Don't the localised
repositories get updated automatically for that kind of stuff?	I thought
additional lines were added automatically?

<rant> It's a real pain in the ass to have to open a new bug for every minor
omitted <em> tag one notices: thinking of a good description, choosing the
right component...  I'd rather prefer some general bug titled `minor
optimalisations in the help docs' or `optimising the locales' or something like
that, where one could submit patches and some authority looks at them and
decides whether they should be applied or no.  Also, that way discussion with
others would be possible in the bug. </rant>

As for adding my name: I can't help it, I'm vain :-p

Thanks, r=me.
Localization of help docs is entirely manual. Localizers need to look at every
single change and update their localized docs by hand.

I'm not against general cleanup bugs, but that should happen after Firefox 1.5
has been released, because we try to keep branch and trunk docs in sync to make
our life easier.

Thanks, I'll save them up for later then.

Btw, I have no cvs acces, so please somebody else check this in (how does this
work usually?)

What about the 'Show File Location' entry in the context menu when you do a
right click on the file entry after it's download is finished?

Now, with this bugfix it's not documentent anymore. It should be something like
this:

<dt>Show File Location</dt>
  <dd>When a download has finished, <span class="noMac">right-click</span><span
class="mac">press &ctrlKey; and click</span> on the file entry and select <span
class="menuPath">Show File Location</span>. Use it to open the folder where
&brandShortName; saved the file.</dd>

Indeed, but I don't know whether it should be mentioned at all.  The main
purpose of the document is to describe the visible features, if one were to
document each possible context menu, it would be a lot of work.  And the entry
says enough for itself, I think.  Maybe something like `You can right-click
(Cmdkey and click) on a file to get more options' (as there is also another
entry Properties which isn't documented yet.
We haven't yet documented the "All files downloaded to:" button though. I guess
we should do that since the button is hard to discover since it doesn't look
like a button. I just filed bug 310907 about that.


Docs for download manager say `show' it is `open'
