Patch

Currently the nsIScriptSecurityManager check in extractFromPage only disallows file: and javascript: URIs, allowing generators to be instantiated with URIs we can't handle (and that we throw an exception on if loaded). This isn't a problem in and of itself as no content has been loaded yet - but as in the linked example, scripts calling Microsummary.update aren't expecting it to throw and arguably they shouldn't need to as any other exceptions we encounter during update are trapped.
