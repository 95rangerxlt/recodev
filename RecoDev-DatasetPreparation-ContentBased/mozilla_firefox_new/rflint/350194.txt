screen shot of the problem

mconnor suggested that instead of "height: 24px" in browser.css for winstripe, we use min-height.  trying that now for the tab elements, but the scrollbuttons and alltabs button may need a few other changes first.
Instead of relying on little images to create the rounded tab effect, it might make more sense to use the -moz-border-radius-* css properties.
The problem with that is that we can't anti-alias CSS radius borders, or do gradients etc.  If we could do this all with CSS and have it look as clean, we would have gone that route in the beginning.
Not going to block on this, although we'd be happy if it gets fixed serendipitously. Same as bug 348138, this works fine with "Extra Large Fonts" in w32.

Is this still targeted for Firefox 3?
So this was mostly fixed by bug 387345. As far as I can see, there's one remaining issue: the tabs' min and max widths are device pixels. For large DPI values, the labels will be cropped sooner and can eventually become completely empty.
