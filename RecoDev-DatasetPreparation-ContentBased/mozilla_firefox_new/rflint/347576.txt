The 'value="Go"' attribute was recently removed from the toolbarbutton-text element of the Go button. I've got two themes that skin the Go button with the text and not an image. Any chance on re-implementing the toolbarbutton-text value and then just doing a display="none" in the default theme? Also, an argument could be made that an XUL image element without a value attribute is akin to an HTML image element without an ALT tag; albeit, not entirely the same issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Interrogate the Go-button using DOMi.

Actual Results:  
The value attribute had recently been removed.

Expected Results:  
A 'value="Go"' attribute should be present.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 347454 ***
Adam, why is this a dup of bug 347454? Bug 347454 is a tracking bug. Did you mean to make this block bug 347454?
Yes, I did. Apologies.
AFAICT the new Go button is supposed to be graphical only (the current design doesn't allow for text to be attached and visually impaired people are supposed to hit Enter instead anyway).

And for theming you've always been supposed to use #go-button instead of [value="Go"] (otherwise your theme simply breaks for non-English locales).

Probably INVALID.
Having buttons disappear when the toolbar is in text-only mode doesn't make sense to me.
In addition to adding the value back to the Go button it would also makes since to include to value="Search" for the search-Go button at the same time.

Simon, wouldn't a non-English locales simply need to add the Go-button (and search-Go) button values to their internationalization conversions?
I seem to have misunderstood your request (I thought you were styling the Go button depending on its value). Of course the value should be returned for those themes wishing to use both text and imagery or even text only.
The go button isn't going to be a separate button, I'm not sure its going to be useful to have a label for something that isn't focusable or configurable.
AFAICT the Go button never was focusable and most users never moved it from beside the address bar. So themes not liking the new attached button style might want to continue as if nothing had happened internally (which otherwise isn't possible without major hacking). Besides, having a label also easily allows for a larger target (for Fitts'y themes not wanting to ship locales as well).

I'll roll this into my patch for bug 347754.

I wasn't able to test this on Mac, but the change is essentially the same and *should* work. Of course I'd sleep much easier if someone tried it out before landing. ;)

Looks fine on Mac -- which is to say, no visible difference, but DOMi shows the labels.
