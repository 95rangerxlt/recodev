Patch

Mostly test changes - I've removed the print preview tests because getting them working is non-trivial and I plan to rip out in-window previewing anyway.
The last time browser_bug386835.js caught a print preview regression was in bug 544018 comment 23 :/

Sorry about the delay reviewing this!

If the browser's current URI is different than the one for which we got the pref, is it possible that the application of the default/global pref will race the application of the site-specific pref for the new URL?

And is it necessary to apply the default/global pref at all if the URLs differ?  Presumably onLocationChange will get called again for the new URL, and it'll apply either the site-specific pref for that URL or the default/global pref.

It can indeed race, and no, it's not necessary. I think I added that while debugging something and simply forgot to remove it.

Heh, funky, but I guess it works.

Is variable name isSaneURI in the patch a spelling mistake of isSameURI?
