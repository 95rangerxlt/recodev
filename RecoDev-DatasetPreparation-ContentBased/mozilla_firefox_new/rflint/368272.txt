Possible patch

In the same spirit of bug 368252, it would be great if notifications of generator installs were broadcast to observers.
This patch adds a "generator-installed" topic with the new generator as the subject and its file name (might be better as a file URI?) as the data.

We might also want a "generator-updated" topic to cover updates and generators installed via reinstallMissingGenerator().

Hmm, indeed, this does seem like it could be useful.  Does this make it easier to code something in the Microsummary Manager extension, or did you have another purpose in mind?


> This patch adds a "generator-installed" topic

I think it would make sense to prefix microsummary-related topics with the string "microsummary" to distinguish them from other notifications, so this should be "microsummary-generator-installed".


> with the new generator as the subject and its file name

The generator stores its file's URI in its localURI property.  If that would be useful to observers, then we should just expose that property through the nsIMicrosummaryGenerator interface.

Right, good point.

Yep, this'll allow me to clean up how the listbox is redrawn when a generator is installed from the add-ons manager and allow me to redraw when a generator's installed via the sidebar or otherwise with the manager open.

This patch adds the additional 'updated' notification and prefixes them both with 'microsummary-'. Generators installed from reinstallMissingGenerator() and user reinstalls/updates will also fire the 'installed' and 'updated' topics respectively.

Looks good, just one more thing: instead of passing the file name to observers via the "data" parameters, simply expose the existing "localURI" property of MicrosummaryGenerator objects as a read-only nsIURI attribute of nsIMicrosummaryObserver (bumping the UUID for that interface in the process).

Then observers will be able to access that value by QIing generator.localURI to nsIFileURL, getting its "file" attribute, and accessing the file's "leafName" attribute.

Expose the generator's localURI attribute, rev the interface's UUID and pass null via the data param.

Looks great, r=myk.

Ryan, do you have CVS access, or do you need someone to check this in?

patch for testing functionality

FWIW, here's a patch for testing this functionality.  It just makes the microsummary service observe its own microsummary-generater-installed/updated notifications and log a message to the console when it observes one.
Patch checked in to the trunk:

Checking in public/nsIMicrosummaryService.idl;
/cvsroot/mozilla/browser/components/microsummaries/public/nsIMicrosummaryService.idl,v  <--  nsIMicrosummaryService.idl
new revision: 1.6; previous revision: 1.5
done
Checking in src/nsMicrosummaryService.js;
/cvsroot/mozilla/browser/components/microsummaries/src/nsMicrosummaryService.js,v  <--  nsMicrosummaryService.js
new revision: 1.53; previous revision: 1.52
done

Thanks for the fix!

Don't notify until after _saveGeneratorXML() is called

The previous patch notified observers before the call to _saveGeneratorXML() resulting in a bit of a race condition (doh!). This patch moves the notification to a more appropriate location.
