regression: bookmarkFeedURI annotation is not set on the children of a live bookmark.

Thus the context menu for such items is broken.

Hrm, it's set on the uri (history) node for it. That's kinda wrong but would still mostly work if I didn't unset uri in bug 371668.

patch

 * Fix the regression from bug 371668, i.e. restore annotations for
   url/vist nodes.
 * Set the bookmark-specific annotations for bookmark-nodes, as well as the
   annotations for the bookmarked uri.
 * Annotate the bookmark as bookmarkFeedURI rather than the bookmarked uri.

Don't you need to add the test to the corresponding makefile?

It is already there, from bug 372750
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
