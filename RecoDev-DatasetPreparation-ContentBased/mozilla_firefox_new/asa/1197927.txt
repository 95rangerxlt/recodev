While running tests for Bug 1021654, we get an error:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | browser/base/content/test/general/browser_sanitize-timespans.js | uncaught exception - NS_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED: Component returned failure code: 0xc1f30001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED) [nsIMessageSender.sendAsyncMessage] at chrome://global/content/bindings/remote-browser.xml:409 

which seems to be caused when we try to sanitize a browser that is already gone. We should try to send a message for existing browsers only, and catch when the browser goes away too quickly.
