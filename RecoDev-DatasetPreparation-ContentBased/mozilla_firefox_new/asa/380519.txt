We use the folderType field of the moz_bookmarks table for marking the toolbar folder. The other possible values for this field are 1) empty string 2) a contractid, pointing to a class which implements nsIRemoteContainer.

One side effect of this implementation is the impossibility to mark a remote container as the toolbar folder; this is generally wrong IMO now that we have reliable item-annotations support in place.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
