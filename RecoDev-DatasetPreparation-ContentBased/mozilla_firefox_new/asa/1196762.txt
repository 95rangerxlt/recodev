This pref observer will listen to preference change events and trigger functionality in the AboutNewTab object.

It will also be responsible for writing to prefs, as we want bi-directional data binding between the content processes and prefs to allow sync to work.

Do we really want to just emit the name for other prefs, e.g., locale.matchOS and locale? It might make more sense to always annotate the prefSet -> prefMap with the type of value you want to emit.

::: browser/components/newtab/RemoteAboutNewTab.jsm:92

> +    this.pageListener.sendAsyncMessage("NewTab:PlacesDeleteURI", data.url);

Can we get a test that makes sure we're sending the expected values for each of the above? Otherwise someone could easily accidentally change placesDeleteURI to give the object instead of url. Although keeping the object would make it more like placesLinkChanged.

Some reason I seem to recall that it's better to check/assert outside of the callback to make it easier to debug where things failed. But perhaps with new fancy promises, this isn't an issue.

In any case, would be good to check the name of the pref as well in addition to the explicit value of the pref (true) instead of calling the same function the NewTabPrefsProvider happens to use.

And should check for the other types of pref values, e.g., the string prefs.

It probably would have been easier to review if these two patches were just combined. I was about to comment about how this emit probably wants to include the pref and value.

Any reason for the start/stopTracking instead of init/uninit as the other services? The non-init name might make it seem like one could call start/stop multiple times (potentially from different places).

We currently have tests for PlacesProvider.jsm. We will add tests for RemoteAboutNewTab.jsm when we pare down the messages needed, in bug 1218992

neat :)

I believe naming convention has LargeFirstLetter for constructors/services. Probably better as gPrefsMap.

Probably go with the full "string" and simply "localized" (as localized bool or localized number don't make sense ;))

Sorry, split it up in two so ursula gets credit for her patch
