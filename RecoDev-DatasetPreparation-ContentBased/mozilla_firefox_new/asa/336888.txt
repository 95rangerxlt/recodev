In recent nightlies the selectBookmark.xul is broken, reporting XML errors.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Tools > Options > General
2. Click "Use bookmark" in the "Home page" section

Actual results:
1. XML Error "undefined entity - line 10, column 1" appears

Expected results:
1. Functional "Select Bookmark" window.

I reproduced this bug with en-US and pl locales, others untested.

What's the earliest nightly you saw this in?
I've seen this in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; pl; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060505 BonEcho/2.0a1 and the latest en-US build, but I suppose this is broken since the removal of places from 2.0. 

I'm sure it worked OK in a places-enabled build from mid-April.
