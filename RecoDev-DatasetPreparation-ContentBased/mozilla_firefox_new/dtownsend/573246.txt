When the Feedback XPI is installed the test browser_bug462289.js fails. This isn't due to any code fault, the test just focuses the search box and presses the tab key expecting focus to go to the browser tab, but the feedback button gets focus instead.

Before landing we'll either have to make this test more lenient or disable it entirely.

This attempts to work around the problem. The goal of the test is to verify that tabbing past the navigation bar makes the tab element focused. This fix keeps tabbing until the active element is no longer in the navigation bar.

I've also slipped in disabling browser_ApplicationPrefs.js which is also a problem for Test Pilot.
