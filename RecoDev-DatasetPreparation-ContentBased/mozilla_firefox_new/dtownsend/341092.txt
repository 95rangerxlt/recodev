If you even remove the "bookmark toolbar widget" once from the toolbar, using the toolbar customization tool, it causes customization in following runs of Firefox to disable the menus.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install clean nightly and run it
2. Use "customize..." to remove the "bookmarks widget" from the bookmark toolbar
3. Restart Minefield
4. Press "customize..." again
5. Exit customization
Actual Results:  
The menu bar stays faded out and disabled

Expected Results:  
The menu bar should return to the active state

I have previously somewhat narrowed to problem to the file "bookmarks_history.sqlite" in the profile directory, however now it seems to stay bugged.

patch rev 1

This is caused by places code assuming that the bookmarks toolbar always exists. On startup the toolbar is accessed and if not there this fails causing various event handlers to not be set up properly.

This patch makes a check that the toolbar is actually there before attempting to do anything with it.

This is the same patch as previously but it applies cleanly on the current trunk.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
