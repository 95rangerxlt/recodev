patch rev 1

All JS modules have a __URI__ property denoting the URI of the module loaded. We can use this to detect which globals are from add-on provided scripts by mapping them back to the add-on ID. This does that in the add-on thread actor. Pretty simple but the testcase requires bug 986757 and bug 986108 in order to work. I don't think there's a reason not to start the review now though.
