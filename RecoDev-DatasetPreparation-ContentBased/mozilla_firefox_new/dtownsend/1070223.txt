The observer could throw an exception, in particular in testing urlbarBindings sometimes does this if windows or tabs are closed before the service initialises. This is causing the jetpack tests to show errors about uncaught promise rejections. So this just wraps in a try...catch.

Uhh yes!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

It seems like this won't hurt. I would definitely run the various search tests to make sure this behaviour isn't tested and expecting an exception/rejection.

Nit: Cu is already defined so you can use: Cu.reportError(e);
I'm not sure why the one below isn't using Cu
