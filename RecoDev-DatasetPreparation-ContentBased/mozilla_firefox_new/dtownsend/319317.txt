Include spellcheck components in packages-static

Adds the spellcheck components and dictionaries to packages-static. These lines were taken from thunderbird's packages-static file so should be ok. From my understanding there will be no failure if those files don't exist (i.e. the spellcheck extension wasn't built).

Fixed unix packaging

I managed to muck up the unix packaging. This version uses the right component names and / direction.
Any chance this could get checked in, been asking in #developers for a while no with no response :(

I can check it in later today if you find no one else.
