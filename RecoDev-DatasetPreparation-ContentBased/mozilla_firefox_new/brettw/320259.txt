Fix for sqlite update

This includes the fixes bryner wrote, and a fix for the duplicate items in bookmarks. It turns out we were always getting those duplicate items before and the weird select statements were hiding them. I fixed InsertItem to check if the item is already there and remove and re-insert it if so.

Also: minor bookmark importer documentation updates.
Fixed on trunk
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
