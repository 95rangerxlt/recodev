patch rev1

I would like to get this landed for at least Firefox 35. This is not needed on ESR since ESR doesn't have a stub installer.

[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: Files are not removed on install and files left behind can lead to problems with the install.
Fix Landed on Version: Firefox 36
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Small. Worst case scenario is that files won't be removed on install. It has been tested thoroughly by myself and has been verified.

It's too late for Firefox 34. We can consider this change for Firefox 35.
