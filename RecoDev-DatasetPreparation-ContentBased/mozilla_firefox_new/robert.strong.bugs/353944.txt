The .shtml handler did not include a default value (e.g. shtmlfile) for its reg key. Also, Firefox can only be registered as the default browser by launching it and making it default or through "Set program access and defaults" initially due to it not being displayed in "Set your default programs". After setting it as default it is displayed in "Set your default programs".

We should verify that all of the protocol and file handlers we register as potential defaults for Firefox have all of the required information due to .shtml in Vista RC1 and gopher not being present at all in Vista Beta 2.

Taking... I have this partially completed.
I'm going to fix this in bug 354005
No longer blocking 1.8.1.1 as per recent discussion with drivers around Vista readiness requirements.
Blocking 2.0.0.2 on the assumption this is part of the Vista-readiness fixes
The patch in bug 354005 fixes this
fixed by the landing of bug 354005
fixed on the branch.
v.fixed with Firefox 2.0.0.2 rc2 build:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070208 Firefox/2.0.0.2, all protocols and file types we care about are set to use FF as default.


Add default values for file handlers if they don't have a default value

verified1.8.1.2
