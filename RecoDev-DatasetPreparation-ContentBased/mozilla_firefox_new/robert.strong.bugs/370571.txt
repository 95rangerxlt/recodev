Need to figure out a decent method to allow installation as a standard user on Vista.

7-Zip SEA's always require elevation on Vista unless they have a manifest that states asInvoker. Same goes for NSIS installer but that is neither here nor there for this bug since it inherits from the 7-Zip SEA.

We could add the asInvoker to the 7-Zip SEA, launch another exe that displays ui providing the user a choice to install system wide or for the user, launch another exe if system wide is selected which would display the UAC prompt to request elevation or continue on in the user case, etc.

I believe that MSI installers provide the ability to do either in a much simpler manner.

I'd like to get this for Firefox 3.0. Most PC's that are delivered with Windows will be delivered with Vista going forward so fixing this would most likely be a great win. I have a couple of ideas on how we can accomplish this with NSIS and will work up a proof of concept.
Proposed behavior (XP and below behavior will not change):

First check if the installer is running on Vista or above
Vista or above

If not Vista or above the installer behaves the same as it does now.

If Vista or above the installer checks if we are already elevated.

If elevated the installer behaves the same as it does now for a "Everyone" install.

If not elevated the installer checks if both of the following
UAC Enabled
User is a member of the administrators group

If not UAC Enabled or the user is not a member of the administrators group
installer behaves the same as it does now for a "Just me" install.

If both UAC Enabled and the user is a member of the administrators group display the UAC prompt.

* Note: this is where I need some guidance:
If the user clicks Cancel in the UAC

1. We could display a page to select an "Everyone" or "Just me" install.
2. We could continue with a "Just me" install.
3. We could display an error message and cancel the install.

I personally prefer 1

* Note: we could add a command line switch to force a "Just me" or "Everyone" installation. We should require that the process launching the installer for this scenario already has the appropriate privileges for the installation type it is trying to perform.

Everyone vs. Just me DUN Wizard page

Instead of using two radio buttons Vista's DUN Wizard page uses a single checkbox with the image denoting that UAC will be required if this is checked. If we go with a page for the cancel case I'd suggest something along these lines. We should be able to add this when it is required to the bottom of the existing Setup Type wizard page also shown in the screen shot.
To fix this right I am going to also fix the bugs I added to this bug's block list... they are just too interwoven to do individually or are simple to do at the same time.

patch rev1

Seth, this requires the updted 7-zip stub ( attachment #282511 ) in other-licenses/7zstub/firefox/ and the UAC plugin ( attachment #282512 ) in toolkit/mozapps/installer/windows/nsis/.

patch rev2

The logic I am using is that if you can elevate you must elevate to use the installer. This keeps the process flow simple and the user experience the same as what one would expect after seeing the UAC dialog.

I am working on a NSIS plugin to allow setting an app as default so the call to SetDefaultBrowserVista in nsWindowsShellService.cpp will no longer be necessary. As it stands now there is the possibility of an edgecase where the required registry keys to set the app as default on Vista won't be present when SetDefaultBrowserVista is called.

This also makes the side by side install experience about as good as possible since if the user has permissions to update the StartMenuInternet keys.

I'm thinking about adding a messsagebox elevation is possible to inform the user that they will be prompted and why it is needed (e.g. updating the startmenuinternet keys).
btw: we could remove nsSetDefaultBrowser.js after this lands if desired. Removing command line args is a good thing in my book but it isn't necessary to fix this bug.
There is now a NSIS plugin for setting an app as the default handler for all of its registered handlers (bug 397884).

r=sspitzer, thanks to robert for walking me through this patch in person
two nits:

1)

2) 
while doing the review, robert saw that he duplicated a block of code that he might want to clean up in the SetAsDefaultAppUser macro:

+  ; It is only possible to set this installation of the application as the
+  ; StartMenuInternet handler if it was added to the HKLM StartMenuInternet
+  ; registry keys.

rstrong: During verification, I noticed that I cannot install Minefield in the default directory as a standard user.  Is this expected?
Marcia, that is correct. If you don't have write access there is no way to write in that directory and you must choose a directory to install into
Can we get this into 2.0.0.10 so it will be ready to fix bug 402976 before beta2 of 3.0 (since this affects side-by-side installs).
I can backport the patch but we will need to upgrade NSIS on the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH tinderboxen from 1.17 to 2.22 which is the version used on the trunk so we can use manifests in the NSIS binaries (see bug 403078)
I'm nervous about taking such a big patch (plus toolchain changes) into 2.0.0.10 (needs to land today or tomorrow, due to bug 403331), I think this has to wait for 2.0.0.11 in January
Should we reopen this bug? It feels odd to be tracking a hot FF2.0.0.10 discussion in a closed bug?!
IMO no, typically closed is in reference to the trunk and the fixed / verified with version refers to the branch.
https://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=5008 has been added to Litmus to cover this scenario.
Clearly we're not going to get this on the 1.8 branch anytime soon. Hopefully a fix in Firefox 3 is good enough, not going to block on it.
Definitely, we need Bug 403078 fixed first
rob: how quickly can you get a patch for this ready? We'd like to get this in for FF2.0.0.13 if possible. (I'm working on bug#403078)
This is a huge patch, and the branch probably needs a different huge patch. If this can't land next week (before March) I don't see how we could safely take it in 2.0.0.13.

Is a reviewed branch patch by next week realistic?
Looks like this will not realistically make 2.0.0.13, maybe next time.
There's two items of work here:

1) Rob's patch - dont know enough to comment on that.

2) the nsis update - I've already started on that last night. Do you want me to stop and undo? Or can we at least get this in? I estimate being finished this afternoon.

(Urg - hit "commit" too quickly, sorry). My nsis work is being tracked in Bug#403078, which still has "blocking1.8.1.13+", so I'll guess I continue, unless I hear otherwise?

Having the Bugzilla assign to me bookmarklet right next to a search query on the toolbar probably isn't the best idea.  Sorry for the spam.
