we have updated the Firefox EULA for Firefox 2 to include terms that make it more "distribution friendly" as well as inclusion of terms and links to the new Firefox Privacy Policy

v2 of the EULA should be displayed and replay the existing version for Fx 2 on all  platforms.  it does not replace the EULA that ships with Fx 1.5 or Fx 1.0.  
this EULA must also be displayed and accepted (in the same way as the installer) for *major* product updates delivered through AUS.

a separate EULA for Thunderbird will be provided.

We're supposed to be removing the note about translations?

I will be following this up with a patch to provide an rtf EULA for the Win32 NSIS installer and this will still be needed by the installers that don't support rtf.

We're going to keep EULA and EULA.rtf in sync, I presume?

Yep, we are going to have to.

Checked in to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH. Leaving open for the remaining patch for the rtf EULA that needs to be landed on the trunk after it re-opens.
Attachment 234062 checked in to trunk. That's all folks!
Need to do the EULAs in the Mac disk images too, huh?
If it doesn't use browser/EULA it does need to be updated... can you add it or provide a pointer to the file that needs to be updated?
The files are in the tree as "license.r," but they contain a couple of byte offsets into the text for style information (to make the heading bold), and it looks like those are going to have to change.
Thanks Mark
--> Firefox 2, unless you think we should respin for this.

Another thing to note here is that the URL for the privacy policy isn't using the new mozilla.com URI scheme. It should probably be pointing to:

http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/privacy/

although I don't know what we'd do for non en-US locales. We don't translate the EULA, right? Chris?
the EULA itself will not be translated, the web content will be.  we should update the URL to fit the scheme, but I don't view this as a blocker for b2 as there is no l10n impact.
OK. I filed bug 350091 to track the update to the privacy policy thing. Rob, if you want to handle that as part of this bug, just dupe the new one against this one.
just to clearify, what will the nav path be from say, the "de" installer license page?

right now it shows english content and the top line says:

For Translations of this License into selected languages please visit http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/licensing.html

then the german user needs to read that page and pick the link to
http://www.mozilla.com/legal/eula/

which has a line for and links to the EULA content for the locale
German  	Deutsch  	HTML  	plain text

are we shooting for the same basic navigation path (but just moving the content to mozilla.com, or will try to shorten?

patch for Mac OS X

beltzner, could you take a look at this just to be sure. The previous EULA for Mac OS X appeared to call out Minefield on the trunk.
Comment on attachment 235714
patch for Mac OS X

The offsets in the styl resource haven't changed, so the wrong part of the header will be displayed in bold face.  The "9.  MISCELLANEOUS" line is really long and will probably cause the resource compiler to croak.  If you don't have a Mac, I might have a few minutes today to do this.

As for the "Minefield" text in browser/app/macbuild/license.r, that file is only used for unbranded builds.  Since the Mac build treats the EULA as a branding file (unlike Win/Lin), we've never put "Firefox" in the non-trademarked-branding version of the license.
(In reply to comment #28)
Mark, if you could do this I'd appreciate it. I can probably get a Mac to finish this up but it will take quite a bit more than a few minutes. Thanks

Mark, the url to the privacy policy needs to be changed from

to
http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/privacy/
Mac EULA checked in on the trunk, with URL change.  Branch checkin needed.
