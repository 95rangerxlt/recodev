2. install minefield using STANDARD setup option


Actual Results:  
minefield was installed on C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\

Is this vista-only, or does it also happen with XP? Is this trunk-only, or does it also happen on branch builds?
Firefox 2 installs into the correct location, so I'm not sure why this would block us. I think we need to fix this before the next release that will use this installer, if I understand the problem correctly. That would be either Fx 2.0.0.1 or Tb 2, depending on schedules.
Prolly deserves a relnote. Rob, can you tell me if this is an accurate description of the problem:

"If you have installed a Thunderbird or Firefox Alpha driver, the new Windows installer may pick the wrong default folder for installing Firefox 2. Please use a "Custom" install and make sure the right folder is selected when installing."

Great. Just great.
There's now a bugzilla record of my IBM-brain jumping into my main consciousness and taking control. I KNEW that happened from time to time.

Let's try that again, but in English:

"If you have installed an alpha or beta version of Firefox 2 or Thunderbird 2, the new Windows installer may select the wrong default folder when installing Firefox 2. Please use a "Custom" install and make sure the right folder is selected when installing."

Apparently this is trunk only .. removing relnote.
STANDARD and CUSTOM setup routine on todays build will both install minefield to "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\".

so i had to uninstall first thunderbird before installing minefield.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061026 Minefield/3.0a1 ID:2006102604 [cairo]
i filed another minefield installer bug:

[url]https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=358116[/url]
Does this affect Minefield only, or all versions of the current installer? Will Thunderbird 2 install over Firefox 2?

If it's just Minefield this doesn't need to block 1.8.1.1, please set the blocking flag back to ? in that case (or leave a note if you can't).
Minefield only
This will be fixed by the patch in bug 354005
