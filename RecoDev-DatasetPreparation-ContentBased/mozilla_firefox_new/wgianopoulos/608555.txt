When i developed the patch for bug 585370, KI only defined application menu icons for menuitems that had defined icons for the classic menu in gnomestripe.

I realized today that the private browsing and addons items do not have icons although they do under windows. At the time I did not realize that there already were gnomestripe icons defined for these items, but it turns out hat there are because they are user on the corresponding about: pages as the favicon.

Seems like these icons should be added to the menu bar items as well.

OK.  I will do a new patch and ask for a ui-review first.

DÃ£o, I think correctly, pointed out that these icons should probably be defined for the "classic" menu as well.  This patch accomplishes that.

New screenshot forthcoming.

ui-r+ in that this fixes the issue the bug is mentioning (icons for add-ons and private browsing).  However, only these items should have icons.  So for instance downloads, error console, and clear recent history shouldn't be using icons.  More details in bug 611570

This is a really low risk patch.  It merely defines icons for menu items in the gnomestripe theme.
Re-targeting.
