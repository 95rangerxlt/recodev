Test environment:
   Windows XP, Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060811, 
   Inspect Objects (inspect32) or Event Watcher (accevent32)
   Screen resolution: 1024x768, High Contrast mode: High Contrast #1 (extra
large)

Description:

On the "Suspected Web Forgery" popup, if you select the "Read More" button, program focus goes to some unknown place.  It takes several tabs to get back to the security popup.

Steps to recreate:

1. Make sure the Google anti-phishing security option is set in the Firefox
security options.
    a. Open Firefox Tools, Options, and open Security page.
    b. Select "Tell me if the site I'm using is a suspected forgery" checkbox
    c. Select "Check by asking [Google] about each site I visit" radio button.

2. Open this web page URL in Firefox browser: 
http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing/phish-o-rama.html

- This results in the display of the "Suspected Web Forgery" pop-up.  (Scroll
bars are present when large fonts are selected).

3. Tab until focus is on the "Read More >>" button.  

4. Press Enter to select the "Read More"  button. 
- This expands the text in the pop-up, but the visual focus is lost at this point.

5. Press the Tab key.  Instead of tabbing to the next selectable item within the "Suspected Web Forgery" popup window, it will most often jump up to the "location" field on the Firefox navigation toolbar.  Press Tab a few more times, and focus will eventually return to the security popup window.

Expected results:

1. After selecting the "Read More >>" button, program focus should remain at the top of the security popup window, just as it was when the pop-up first displayed.  Pressing Tab should cause focus to move to the next selectable item within the warning popup ("How Bon Echo protects you"), rather than jumping to some point outside of the popup.
