Steps to reproduce:

1. Select Tools/Options
2. Tab to Connection Settings button.  WindowEyes speaks "Connection.
Connection Settings. O. Button.  Determine how Bon Echo connects to the
Internet."  In order, this is the group box label, the button label, the button
accesskey, the focused element type, and the associated text label.
3. Now go to Advanced pane and tab to Edit Languages button.  WindowEyes speaks "Languages.  Edit Languages.  L.  Button."

Expected outcome:
WindowEyes should speak "Languages.  Edit Languages.  L.  Button.  Choose Languages web pages are displayed in."  In other words, it should read
what it's reading now, but then also read the text of the associated label.

add missing id attribute to button so description can point to it

Description was already trying to control the button, but the button lacked a matching id attribute.

Updated title to reflect changed wording after preferences reorg.  (Bug still exists, but the patch has almost certainly rotted.)
This patch doesn't work, because descriptions don't actually support associated controls.  Labels do, but descriptions don't.  The question now becomes whether we want to use a label here, which to the best of XULPlanet's knowledge can't wrap.

That's just not true, and if it is true, it's a bug.  We use the <description control="..."> idiom in many places.
As Mark said, description supports the control attribute.

XUL planet mentions this, but has incorrect info as to what it does:
http://xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_description.html

When used with a description is affects how screen readers speak controls that receive focus. It does not affect mouse usage at all. The XUL Planet entry needs to be fixed.

Oops, sorry about that -- I was looking at too high a level (the XBL bindings) to see that this was so:

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/accessible/src/base/nsAccessible.cpp&rev=1.203&mark=240#223

I'll check in the fix so this can be verified in tinderbox builds.
Oops, still not even the right code:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/accessible/src/base/nsAccessible.cpp#2205

But anyway, in on trunk, so requesting approval for a no-risk fix in a sec...

This properly associates a label for a button with the button for screen readers; it's an extremely low-risk fix.
