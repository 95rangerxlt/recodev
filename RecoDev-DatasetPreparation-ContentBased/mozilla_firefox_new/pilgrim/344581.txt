Requires WindowEyes 5.5K and a Firefox build that has the new prefs reorg.

1. Tools / Options / Advanced / Network
2. Tab to editbox within the "Cache" groupbox (mine says "50".)

Results:

WindowEyes speaks "se up to 50" (not a typo, WindowEyes does not speak the "U").

Expected results:

If you tabbed to the corresponding control in Firefox 1.5 (under Tools / Options / Advanced / Cache), WindowEyes spoke the entire text including the labels before and after the editbox, e.g. "Use up to 50 MB of disk space for the cache."

use labelledby trick as in Firefox 1.5

As with bug 344572, we need to use a "DHTML Accessibility" trick to associate the textbox with the container hbox so that WindowEyes reads the preceding label + the current value + the trailing label.

better patch that doesn't redeclare namespaces

This is a smaller patch that doesn't redeclare the namespaces, since they are already declared at the top of the file.
Mark you should land this on trunk immediately so we let it bake for a few days before landing on 1.8 branch.

Needs multiple relation support to work completely, but supports accessible name for now

Needs multiple relation support to work completely, but supports accessible name for now
This tweaks the code for Orca which uses labelledBy relation, not accessible name. For now we have to point labelledby to objects that have an accessible object. In the future, being pointed at by a relation should be enough to require a relation is created for it.

Ginn, will you check it in if it gets r=?
