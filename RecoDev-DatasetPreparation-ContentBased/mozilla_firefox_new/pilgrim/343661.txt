Steps to reproduce:

1. Select Tools/Options
2. Tab to Connection Settings button.  WindowEyes speaks "Connection.
Connection Settings. O. Button.  Determine how Bon Echo connects to the
Internet."  In order, this is the group box label, the button label, the button
accesskey, the focused element type, and the associated text label.
3. Now go to Advanced pane, Security tab, and tab to Configure Security Warnings button.  WindowEyes speaks
"Warnings.  Configure Security Warnings.  G.  Button."

Expected outcome:
WindowEyes should speak "Warnings.  Configure Security Warnings.  G.  Button.  Choose which security warnings should be displayed while browsing."  In other words, it should read what it's reading now, but then also read the text of the associated label.

Technically nsAccessible::GetXULLabelContent should handle getting the @value attribute from an associated [description] element (currently it only handles getting the label from the [description]'s child text nodes), but I'll file a separate bug for that.

Mark, I wish you'd fix GetXULLabelContent()

alternate patch to fix root problem in nsAccessible

As per Aaron's wishes, this fixes the problem at the source instead of working around it in the UI.
I don't have commit access.  Aaron, can you check this in?
Checked in. Thanks Mark.

This doesn't break handling of a description that has children rather than a value attribute, does it?  Or do such things not exist?
They exist in both flavors (value vs. children) for label and description and this does not break any of that. Just adds description with value.
