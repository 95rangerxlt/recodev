At the moment, the preference actor from bug 943251 guards all of its calls to ensure you have the proper pref set.

It's probably simpler to remove all these guards in the actor itself, and then just not list it at all in the "restricted" set[1] of global actors.

Only register pref actor on b2g if certified is allowed

When reviewing bug 943251, I forgot about the outer block list we have on b2g.

So, this removes all the checks inside the actor, and just removes the actor entirely when we forbid certified.

I know it is kind of duplicate effort to also not register the actor from main.js,
but I would be at ease if we also explicitely prevent it from being registered over here:

Well, there has been talk of using this in the browser too (see bug 986855), so we'd need to register it somewhere, right?

Sure thing, I'm just suggesting to respect the restrictPrivileges variable:

-  this.registerModule("devtools/server/actors/preference");
+  if (!restrictPrivileges) {
+    this.registerModule("devtools/server/actors/preference");
+  }

Oh!  Yeah, that makes total sense! :)
