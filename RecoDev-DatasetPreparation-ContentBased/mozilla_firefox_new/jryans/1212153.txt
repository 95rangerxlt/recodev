Nit: I don't think hitting the 80 char limit is worth sacrificing searchability in the case of a long hardcoded module name, especially since it was already over the limit here..  Up to you though

Okay, I'll put them all on one line.

This means that the addon manager now has a hard dependency on Devtools client. Thunderbird and SeaMonkey currently don't package devtools-client so restartless addons have stopped working.

This code doesn't look like a hard dependency and I don't understand why it would be breaking restartless add-ons for you. Please file a bug on it.

This is Bug 1218145 already filed.

> I don't understand why it would be breaking restartless add-ons
Because (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE):
Error: 1445764608642	addons.xpi	ERROR	startup failed: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.isModuleLoaded]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/addons
I don't believe this bug is not the cause of the add-on manager issue.  Instead, it's about how DevTools client files are installed, which changed outside of here.

I'll investigate bug 1218145 that's been filed.

I'll try that again: This bug is **not** the cause of the problem, AFAIK.

I agree; or at least not the only one of a set of cooperating causes. This bug landed on October 9th, but I reported bug 1218145 (originally with a different title) about a problem which appeared on SeaMonkey between the 19th ("last known good" nightly) and the 24th ("first known bad"). I haven't tested Thunderbird, though.
