Log from the Browser Console

Both Firefox 37 and Nightly can't start any simulator using WebIDE on OpenSUSE Tumbleed (rolling release version). All simulators and both the ADB and the DevTools add-ons are installed.

I've added the ADB logging settings to about:config and attached what happened in the browser console to this bug.

I don't have SELinux, AppArmor or a Firewall configured on this machine. I originally thought that something was killing the B2G process but apparently it is something else.

While I was trying to debug this I saw the same thing happening to a friend who was using arch linux x86_64 as well.

I attempted to use the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed live CD[1] to reproduce this.

However, it seems to not support the mouse of my VM (VMware Fusion), so I was not able to proceed.

Is there a different live CD I should try?

The rolling release might not have support for your VM. I've only tried it with Virtualbox and it worked for me. I think that the non-rolling release might help:

Okay, great!  I was able to reproduce the issue with this live CD and updating to Firefox 37.0.2.
Can you test the following Firefox build?  For me, it resolves the issue.

I can confirm it working in here. Thanks a lot for the fix.

0001-Bug-1159083-Pass-XAUTHORITY-to-Linux-simulators.-r-j.patch

Jan, it seems it became necessary to pass along XAUTHORITY for simulators to launch on Linux.  I really don't follow what caused this to suddenly matter when it did not before... but in any case, it seems to resolve the issue.

I'll attempt to land in 38 - 40.  Luckily we don't have to update the simulator add-ons to fix it, thanks to your work! :D

Try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=2cfcfa1d5b57
Since this bug was happening on OpenSUSE and Arch Linux but not on Ubuntu I am guessing that there is a chance that the new behavior is due to those distros migration to systemd & friends. At least this is the only thing I can see that is really different from the two sets of distros. I have no idea why systemd stuff would prevent some userland app from launching though...
@andre ubuntu 15.04 (from last week) is the first version also using systemd. and yes, this bug is repro there.

Too late for 38.0 but taking it for 38.0.5.
If you think it matters, we could take it for the first esr (38.1.0).

See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process for more info.
This bug did occur for me in 14.10, most likely with 36 or 37. It was also a nearly fresh install of Ubuntu when the bug occurred for me, so was likely not caused by other programs. I can't go back and test now, as I have upgraded to 15.04.
