After bug 912121, we should fold the changes in the migration docs into the hacking wiki page.
I have updated the Hacking[1] wiki page to match the new state after
the migration.

In addition to making updates, I also folded in new sections from the
migration guide describing how to add new JS, chrome content, and
chrome themes (with some rewriting assuming the page is read mostly by
new contributors). Please review the new content to see if any tweaks
are needed. I'm hopeful this will make build system gunk less
confusing for new contributors.

I did a few light edits of Will's new MDN Contributing[2] page as
well, but I haven't added extra content there as the current flow of
document seemed nice as-is. Free free to port more content to MDN
where it makes sense to do so.
