I noticed that recently that the app will restart when connecting the webIDE to debug it. Is there any way that we can prevent this from happening? Sometimes we'll get an app into a certain state and want to debug it when the debugger is not attached. Having the app restart means we lose this state that we want.

Today, when a runtime app is selected we:

* Launch the app if it is not running OR
* Reload the app if it is running

Instead, what we should do is:

* Launch the app if it is not running OR
* Bring the app to the front if it is running

But today, we don't have actor support to say "bring to front".  Alex, do you know how we might implement that on the actor side?
I think you don't need anything on the actor side.
It looks like you just want to always and only call `start` actor method,
which should bring the app to front when already running.

Ah, it does work!  I was just confused since we skip it if the app is "running", but in this case we want to just call it anyway.

Avoid reloading runtime apps on select

This is pretty straightforward... except the comparison change in |set selectedProject|.  I don't really follow why it's now suddenly necessary to compare the JSON instead of the objects directly.

To test this, I open a runtime app, like Clock.  Then I select the same app again.  Without the comparison change, the same app is seen as new.  Also, the comparison change is not needed without the rest of this changeset... :/

Right. Makes me sad.
