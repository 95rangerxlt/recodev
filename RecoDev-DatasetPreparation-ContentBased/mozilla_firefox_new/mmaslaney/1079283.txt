We need some new SVG icons for our rooms/35 iteration of Firefox Hello (reference http://people.mozilla.org/~dhenein/loop/rooms/):

- close/x button (see FTE panel with ToS + co-branding)
- copy and trash icons for Current Conversations list (white icons, we will place on colored background)
- tour icon for cog menu
- help icon for cog menu

Hi Michael, can you provide a point value.
Point value: 5

New icons attached. 

Pinging Darrin for a UI review.
The icons in the spec are colored, these are black. Can someone from front-end indicate if they'd prefer colored icons, or if we can recolor the svg at runtime.

Dan or Mike can probably answer this.
The funny thing is, these icons are already colored, they actually use an extremely specific shade of black: rgb(35, 31, 32).  Instead of overriding it, which is more CSS to maintain, it seems like having the icons specify the color they actually want is the best way to go.
Roger. Michael, can you re-attach the icons in the colors specified in the mockup? Thanks!

The only one I see missing is a blue circle (like copy) but with the check mark in it (try clicking the copy button at http://people.mozilla.org/~dhenein/loop/rooms/room-hover.html)
