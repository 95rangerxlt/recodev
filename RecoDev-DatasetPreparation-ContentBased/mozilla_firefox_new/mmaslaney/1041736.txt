Hi Michael, can you provide a point value for this bug.
Since this would fit in here quite neatly, could you also include the visual styling for search suggestions (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8459805) into your spec?

Let me know if you think that this would be better served by a separate bug.

Those look great!

Two little concerns:
- The highlight of the currently selected suggestion is very subtle. How about emphasizing that a bit more? (http://people.mozilla.org/~mmaslaney/Search/AwesomeBar-google-search.png)
- Maybe that's just me, but the text »Google search for:« seems to sit a few pixels too high up.

Thanks for the feedback, Philipp. I increased the contrast of the type and moved the information down a pixel or two.
