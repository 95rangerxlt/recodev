The border should move with the drag image.

Notice that the box-shadow moves with the drag image, but the border stays still.

Tim, can you add some file references and steps for somebody to fix this?

I am waiting for Tim's comment on this.
Regarding the bug, I think border is *supposed* to be there, because as we drag a thumbnail, the next thumbnail comes in the place of first one. So do we really need to make the border move?
Currently, the cell has a border that gets darker when a site is hovered. The site itself has a box-shadow. Ideally, the site should have the border *and* the box-shadow but that's not possible because of bug 480888 - that's why I took this workaround.

There seems to be some activity in bug 480888 recently, maybe it'll get fixed soon? There are two options here:

1) Wait until bug 480888 is fixed and move the border to .newtab-site.

2) Let the border-color return to normal when we started dragging site. We could do this by setting the 'dragged' attribute for .newtab-cell as well like here:

We could of course do [2] and then [1] when it's really fixed.

The first patch didn't properly remove the 'dragged-cell' attribute.

Thank you, Owen! That looks really good but we can have that a little easier, I think. Please flag me for review again when you upload a new patch.

I think we should just re-use the "dragged" attribute so that we don't need to take extra care of it being removed in Drag.end().

Can you please define a variable (like 'cell' or 'parentCell') for 'aSite.node.parentNode' before the querySelectorAll() call above?

Thanks, Owen. I'll give you feedback+ because the patch looks really good but I'd like two small changes to be made before we can land it.

Please define this variable above the for-loop so that you can use it for the querySelectorAll() call as well.

|let nodes = gGrid.node.querySelectorAll("[dragged]")| would be a little better here because that would constrain the selector to grid descendants only.

Oops, I didn't realized that the style change was done in a theme-specific CSS file. Please also change the newTab.css files in themes/winstrip and themes/gnomestrip. Sorry.
