Hmm, if I'm reading attachment 676400 correctly, that just removes the test, right?
Josh: ping?
Yes.
So should we close this bug then?
It would probably be good to write a browser-chrome test that initiated a download and checked that it didn't end up in the history and that we didn't receive a link visited notification for it.

After looking at the logs. The test finished without errors, but after that there is an alert or the window loses focus, any idea what can it be?

Hmm, I'm not sure about the alert problem. However, it occurs to me that this test isn't actually testing what I was thinking it was - instead of setting up the save and download process manually, I think it would be a more useful test to initiate a download from a link on in a private window, wait until it's complete and ensure that there was no link visited notification and no record in the history.

Nice. Sorry about the lag on my end.
So is this ready to land?
Let's put it through try first.

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=e48396fdf052
The test finished without errors, but after the test finishes there is a timeout, any idea?

INFO TEST-END | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/toolkit/components/downloads/test/browser/browser_download_history.js | finished in 2157ms

Maybe something in

>   2.123 +      if (aDownload.targetFile.exists()) {
>   2.124 +        aDownload.targetFile.remove(false);
>   2.125 +      }

is throwing?
I tried using a try/catch block, but still it fails. But I'm sure now that is failing only on Windows. See: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=1d5c5394e902
I'll keep researching.
Any updates on this?
Over in bug 817477, I'm preparing to remove support for global private browsing altogether.  This is one of the last remaining pieces that I would like us to fix before that bug lands...
> >   2.123 +      if (aDownload.targetFile.exists()) {
> >   2.124 +        aDownload.targetFile.remove(false);
> >   2.125 +      }

I have investigated this and this part of code doesn't throw any errors as Andres mentioned in comment 21.  I suspect that when the targetFile.remove(false) is executed,  another UI (alert) appears so the last browser window loses the focus on Win.  I have tried to invoke window.focus() in registerCleanupFunction() but without luck.

Any thoughts?

This doesn't look right to me. Shouldn't the executeSoon be outside of the if block, to ensure we wait until the acceptDialog method is available? Otherwise we just attempt to run the code over and over.

Let me rewrite that part. ;-)

I have updated the patch based on comment 25

However, still getting issues on windows.
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?rev=86bb39abbaa8&tree=Try

Any suggestions how to fix that?
Aha! It's the completed downloads alert - on OS X and Linux, there's a platform system that handles it. On Windows, we pop open http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/alerts/resources/content/alert.xul, which is of type alert:alert (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/alerts/nsAlertsService.cpp#116, for reference). You should set browser.download.manager.showAlertOnComplete to false when running this test, and clear it when cleaning up.
