Talked with Timur on #l10n, we should kick off builds for Kazakh on Firefox 4 again.

Timur, en-US strings are coming from http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/ at this point in time, l10n strings go to ssh://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/kk/.

Given that you haven't landed in a while, your hg account might be suspended. If so, just poke on irc.
