We should remove the places l10n files from the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH, they're not
used and will thus not be properly maintained.
And given our QA/build requirements coming up, making a build burn for unused
strings is probably a waste of time.

I changed the innards of #ifdef MOZ_PLACES in jar.mn to #error and removed
all the files that are in that #ifdef.

Patch coming up.

Moving review request over to mconnor, not a biggie as Ben signed this off on the news post already.

overall this looks right, but we should make configure fail for moz_places as well so people get the failure right up front as well.
File bug 343067 on the configure.in, marking this bug fixed, as the real issue
of this bug is done.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
