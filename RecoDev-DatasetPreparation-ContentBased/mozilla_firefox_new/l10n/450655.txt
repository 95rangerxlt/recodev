We're going to take a few more locales for Firefox 3.0.2, as beta releases.

The real list is not totally clear yet, I'll bring that late in the game.

We're going to take a few more locales for Firefox 3.0.2, as beta releases.

The real list is not totally clear yet, I'll bring that late in the game.
Status update, the following 9 locales are green compare-locales-wise:

bg, bn-IN, gl, hi-IN, is, kn, mr, te, th

bg is blocked on bug 450579, search decisions impacting engine removal
gl needs landing, bug 442891, bug 442893
th needs landing, bug 443375, bug 450144

That leave gl and th at risk, for the most part due to cvs account problems.

All others are looking good for at least the beta stage they're going into anyway.
gl and th are done with their blockers for beta, too.

bg not yet.
