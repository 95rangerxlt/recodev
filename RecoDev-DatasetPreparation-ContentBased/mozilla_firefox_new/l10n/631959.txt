We have been making progress with Zulu translations with a team of interns.  They've moved quite quickly to a 72% translated status.

All core strings are translated, with work now happening on items that are new for Fx4 e.g. Sync.

The technical quality still needs quite a bit of review.  But we'd like to be able to start linguistic review on a live product for which we'd need to have builds.

So can we start builds at least as we move through linguistic reviews.  We can then evaluate how to progress for moving to official releases.

Nightlies should turn up tomorrow.
