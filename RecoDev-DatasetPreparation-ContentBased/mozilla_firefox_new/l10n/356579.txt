As pointed out in bug 354576, the tr-tdk search plugin shipped with turkish versions of 1.5 is broken due to an incompatible site change, and can't be resurrected.

Updates should remove the plugin, and thus, we should add the two files to removed-files.in.

Patch coming up.

l10n part, don't ship tr-tdk on 1.5.0.x
Created attachment 242191
installer part, remove tr-tdk on update

The second patch should get rid of the tr-tdk plugins for existing installs, just like we did with dictionary.com.
We should take this bug instead of bug 354576, if this get's plussed, minus the other.
This is the 1.8.0 branch version of bug 354576, moving blocking flag here.

This one is OK: +

I can't set flag + as I'm told by Bugzilla that I'm not authorised.

Checked in.

I'm leaving the bug open for investigating how things should behave on the 1.8 branch wrt updates from the 1.5 tree to the 2.0 one.
This seems to have been fixed allright by now.
