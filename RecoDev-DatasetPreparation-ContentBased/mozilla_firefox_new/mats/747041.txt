The difference of resource:///modules/ and resource://gre/modules/ is exposed by building Firefox on top of xulrunner. So these two resource URLs are clearly-differentiated.


browser/modules/webappsUI.jsm:
WebappsInstaller.jsm is imported from resource://gre/modules/.
However it locates at resource:///modules/.

browser/modules/WebappsInstaller.jsm:
Three files (Services.jsm, FileUtils.jsm, and NetUtil.jsm) are imported from resource:///modules/.
However they exist at resource://gre/modules/.

browser/components/places/content/places.js:
MigrationUtils.jsm is imported from resource://gre/modules/.
However it locates at resource:///modules/.

Felipe or Myk - Any ideas?
If I understand this correctly, Takanori is saying that when you build Firefox on top of XULRunner, with the two inhabiting different directories, then resource:///modules/ and resource://gre/modules/ represent two different locations, and some references to modules in those locations are currently referencing the wrong location.

This hasn't shown up in our test builds and in nightly builds because those put Firefox and the underlying platform (the GRE) into the same directory.  So it doesn't affect our ability to ship Firefox with the runtime.  But we should still make our code work for Takanori's use case and correct our references to these modules.

this is tracked in bug 739968, fwiw, I think we can fix it in hours.  Btw, surely the non-difference between the 2 paths in common browser builds is quite error-prone (as you can see we keep using the wrong path).

You are right.
At least, Fedora and RHEL build Firefox on top of xulrunner.
In this case,
resource://gre/modules/ represents jar:file:///usr/lib64/xulrunner-14/omni.ja!/modules/ and
resource:///modules/ represents jar:file:///usr/lib64/firefox/omni.ja!/modules/
If anyone wants to provide a patch to the webapps{ui,installer} I can review it
Created attachment 616920
Fix the path of importing jsm files in webappsUI.jsm and WebappsInstaller.jsm.
Created attachment 616923
Fix the path of importing jsm files in browser.js.

Another wrong path found in browser/base/content/browser.js.
Thanks Takanori!

Felipe - Is there anything needed to be verified from an end-user perspective? Doesn't look like it, but I'd like to confirm.
Jason: no, nothing necessary
