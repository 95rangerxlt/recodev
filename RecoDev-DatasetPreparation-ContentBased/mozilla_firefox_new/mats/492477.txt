This is simple, the test boxes don't have Growl installed so there is no alerts system to test.
The solution would to a) install Growl and make sure it is always running, b) insert a tautology into the test or c) just ignore it.
b- An ok(true, "No installed Growl to test") (or a todo(false, ...)) would be fine.
