Created attachment 242247
patch, first draft, when building with places use places history but non-places bookmarks
Created attachment 242250
2nd draft, includes fixes for bugs:  356175, 356453, 356630, 356631
so far, the two big problems I have left are:

1) bug #356453, clear private data doesn't appear to clear history
2) bug #356174, implement the history sidebar on top of places.

I still need to test to make sure that:

1)  with --enable-places, nothing else is broken
2)  with --disable-places, I didn't break anything

after I do that, I'll seek a review.

did some smoketesting of places / non-places, and I think this is worthy of initial review (while I work on the two known issues for places-enabled)

dietrich, can you review?

got some good suggestions from dietrich over aim.
over aim, dietrich points out:

1) what is MOZ_PLACES_NEED_NEW_UI

it's a flag I'm using to disable any Places history UI that was not in Fx 2.0.  I'll rename to MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI

2)  I'll remove the bogus ones, where I'm doing

#ifndef MOZ_PLACES_NEED_NEW_UI

3) MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS_OR_NEED_NEW_UI

I need to fix that one, as well.

4) add to the wiki what MOZ_PLACES, MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS and MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI are for.

dietrich, here's what's not working yet:

To clarify: This the expected behavior and state of things WRT to the build flags after this patch, correct?

- MOZ_PLACES: Use Places for history backend, use old History UI.
- MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS: Use Places for bookmarks UI and backend.
- MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI: Use Places for history UI and backend.
- Turning on all 3 is effectively the equivalent of an all-Places build (ie: what MOZ_PLACES does now)

yes.

yes.

> - MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI: Use Places for history UI and backend.

to be specific, this is is to turn off places-on-history UI that was not part of the history UI in Fx 2.

> - Turning on all 3 is effectively the equivalent of an all-Places build (ie:
what MOZ_PLACES does now)

Yes, if you applied the patch and turned on all 3 (note, you can't easily do that as there is no configure for MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI and MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS), you should get MOZ_PLACES + a history sidebar.

Note, I have not attempted this.  I have used MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI and MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS when auditing the code to separate history-on-places from bookmarks-on-places.

As we go forward with bookmarks-on-places, we'd use MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS as starting points for work that needs to be done.

I imagine we'll end up removing the code turned off by MOZ_PLACES_NEW_HISTORY_UI

fix broken "add bookmark", thanks dietrich

from aim, bookmarks were not working, because of this:

+#ifdef MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS
function addBookmarkAs(aBrowser, aBookmarkAllTabs, aIsWebPanel)

should be:

+#ifndef MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS
function addBookmarkAs(aBrowser, aBookmarkAllTabs, aIsWebPanel)
Comment on attachment 244498
fix broken "add bookmark", thanks dietrich

This looks good to me. All the history and bookmarks UI are in place, and basic bookmarks tests checked out. We should get this checked in, and handle other side effects moving forward.

seeking second review from browser peer (gavin)
there have been changes to browser.js (for "Bug 356590 - Clean up nsContextMenu and make it a bit more window-agnostic, partly fixes bug 281490. r=gavin.") that require some adjustment for bit rot.

working on it now, but I think gavin can still review the attached patch.

style nit: I prefer avoiding explicit comparisons to null/undefined/"" when they aren't needed. I don't really know if other places code follows this same convention.

Kinda seems like this would be easier to read as a switch to select the right sort constant, then a single assignment, and a special case for the dayandsite "group". Or maybe it's best left as-is, up to you.

This comment is a little verbose, and isn't really necessary, I think. I'd just remove it.

The elementtofocus stuff was removed in bug 322077, so it should not be readded here.

I don't really understand this comment. Can you clarify, and ideally point to a bug #?

fixed, thanks.

until places is enabled by default, I'm going to have to watch mozilla/browser/components/history/content/history-panel.xul  and mozilla/browser/components/history/content/history.js for changes.

2)

I fixed this style nit in two places in history-panel.js, thanks.

I fixed it to use a switch statement, but kept the code the same.

for the new history-sidebar-on-places, context menu delete (or delete key) doesn't work yet.  I've logged bug #359462 to track this impending regression (if you enable places) and I've fixed the comment to refer to it.

I'll attach a final version of the patch.
