The 'All Tabs' menu button seems to be misaligned with the tabs i.e. it seems to be lower than the tabs by 1 pixel or so. As a result, when hovered/clicked, the bottom of the 'All Tabs' button overflows beyond the tabstrip bottom border.

Reproducible: Always

'All Tabs' menu button misaligned with tabs
I would also suggest that the chevron be "centered" over the scrollbar chevron if at all possible.  That would look much better.

I still see this problem with 0818 build when there is 'No Overflow'. During overflow, the AllTabs menu along with the right scroll button align themselves to the tabs properly. 
Hence the problem still needs to be fixed when in 'no overflow' state. 

There are other problems with the AllTabs menu button when in overflow state though, as mentioned in the following bugs that I filed today:

Confirming.  I'm still seeing this in the 8/20 branch build.

While you're doing this, it's also misaligned in pinstripe ...

this screen shot from arpad  has since been fixed (by michael wu.)  the other screen shot (and the original bug) is still valid.
mac has a slightly different misalignment, but it is still misaligned.

mac all tabs misalignment
changes to mozilla/toolkit on the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH on 8-26-06 have fixed the all tabs button alignment for winstripe.  (I'll attach a screen shot)

pinstripe still needs work.

screen shot of winstripe all tabs (overflow and no overflow) after 8-26-06 changes
part of the problem with pinstripe, unlike winstripe, is the tab images (http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/toolkit/themes/pinstripe/global/tab-left.png, tab-middle.png and tab-right.png) have a px transparent row at the top.  

the new images from jay (see bug #350139) do not have this problem, so I think this bug should be fixable by:

setting the height of the scrollbuttons and all tabs button elements to be the same height as the tabs (22px), an setting the margin-bottom to be the same as the tabs (3px).
fixed with changes for bug #350139.
