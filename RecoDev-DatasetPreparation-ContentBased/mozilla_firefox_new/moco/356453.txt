add back UI hook for "Clear Private Data" to trunk-with-places, as well as (I'm guessing) the code to clear history

my patch in bug #356487 adds back the menu item to the tools menu, but I need to check if it really clears the history data, as we expect
", as well as (I'm guessing) the code to clear history"

I guessed wrong, as it works fine.  I was confused because my url bar autocomplete was returning bookmarks.

and, I'm lame.

so the UI fix for this is still part of bug #356487

fixed
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
