This issue occurs when there are multiple tabs open and the user is on a tab that "onbeforeunload" is not active on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page where "onbeforeunload" is active
2. Open several more tabs and remain on one of the new tabs
3. Close the window, when the "are you sure you wish to navigate away" message comes up, hit cancel and the window will close anyway.

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not close

Tried to reproduce using simple onbeforeunload page coded like this:

<html>
<body>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
  <!--
  window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    return "Test";
  }
  -->
</script>
</body>
</html>

Steps Attempted:
1. Open onbeforeunload page on one tab
2. Open second tab at http://www.google.com/
3. Open third tab at http://www.google.com
4. Make third tab active (doesn't seem to matter which one is active)
5. Close window button (not tab close)
6. First tab (onbeforeunload) is made active and "are you sure you wish to navigate away" message is displayed
7. Select "Cancel"
8. Window doesn't close anyway

Tried these steps many times and only got a failure once, when step 8 led to the window closing. I was running javascript console at the time, and this is the error message logged at the time:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMWindowInternal.focus]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbrowser.xml :: setFocus :: line 744"  data: no]

I have not been able to reproduce again. Looks like you an uncaught exception caused Firefox to close, not a misinterpretted onbeforeunload function.



Note also bug 327139 and related issues.

Adding relevant parts of the error message to summary.
confirmed, but this is "fixed" in the trunk and the 1.8.1 branch by my fix for 

see bug #348183, especially comment #9 from bryner about what might be going on here.

for the trunk and the 1.8.1 branch, the call to element.focus() is now wrapped
with a try catch:

-                element.focus();
+                try {
+                  element.focus();
+                }
+                catch(ex) {
+                  dump("focus() failed, see bug #348183: ex = " + ex + "\n");
+                }


Created attachment 233300
test case
I'm planning on backing out the patch for bug 348183 on trunk.
I do that in bug 361383, but it should not result in this bug anymore, since bug 348357 is fixed.
Anyway, this bug is already fixed, and stays fixed, so I'm marking it fixed now.


onbeforeunload does not prevent firefox close when user presses "cancel" (NS_ERROR_FAILURE [nsIDOMWindowInternal.focus] tabbrowser.xml :: setFocus)
