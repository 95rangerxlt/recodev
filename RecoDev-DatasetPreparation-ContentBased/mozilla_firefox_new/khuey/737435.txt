I updated the 64-bit windows install on Windows 7 and now Firefox won't start. Windows says:

The program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

The installation process should have check for the library and aborted instead of leaving me with a browser that can't be run.

Yesterday's update, and previous updates, didn't have this problem.

I don't know how to get the build id, but it was the Nightly update available at 11:00 Eastern time today. Windows gives the file version as 14.0.0.4462

You need to install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package, link:

Confirmed on Win8CP 64bit too.

b972b89518c3	Serge Gautherie â€” Bug 735810. (Cv1) Stop trying to package MSVC dlls when WIN32_REDIST_DIR isn't set. r=khuey.
Update also fails on WindowsXP SP3.
Fixed by backout.

Ftr, I checked
/pub/firefox/nightly/2012/03/2012-03-20-04-35-30-mozilla-central/
firefox-14.0a1.en-US.win64-x86_64.*

.exe, .complete.mar and .zip include the 2 v10 dlls.
.partial.20120320031130-20120320043530.mar does not, which is expected.

But .exe and .zip removed-files list files of all 4 MSVC versions :-(
(*.mar, I can't check.)

Sorry about that.

WRONG!
This link points to a VULNERABLE, outdated and superseded version of the MSVCRT.

See but http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2467173 and
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS11-025.mspx
which point to the current version.

You are responding to something that's over a year old ...

Correct.
The link given in comment #1 was but outdated when it was written!


Windows builds fail to start due to missing MSVCR100.dll
