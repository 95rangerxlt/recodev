Oops. Bug 337390 neglected to realize that if a user shuts down Windows XP without first closing Firefox, they'll get the Session Restore bug when they next start up. That's not a "serious error". Patch coming up to change the string so it's less scary.

Isn't that still confusing?

And why doesn't Firefox store the data properly anyway? I think Windows is very generous when shutting down. Other applications have even time to ask the user whether he wants to save his data or not.
I filed  a new bug on the remaining confusion and arguably sub-optimal default behavior:

Bug 358667 - Session Store should not restore after a user-initiated OS shutdown.


session restore dialog thinks shutting down w32 is a "serious error"
