adds search suggest URL to the answers.com searchplugin
--> blocking b2, but would like to get in b1, it's a braindead change

Gavin, can we get this on trunk ASAP?
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/searchplugins/answers.xml 	1.4
Just to verify, answers.com is English only, so the search suggest doesn't have any trademarks/product complexity?
If a locale decides to ship this plugin, it needs to have the search suggest url in it?

Yes, exactly.  If they ship the English plugin, it should have the English search suggest URL in it.

If they ship a plugin that references answers.com in another language, it should have the search suggest URL for that language, if answers.com provides one.
