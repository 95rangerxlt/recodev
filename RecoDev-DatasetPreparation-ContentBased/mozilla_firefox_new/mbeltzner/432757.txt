change to #0055bb

.ac-url-title was switched from green (#006600) to a light blue (#0066cc) on Vista since green isn't a colour that's used all that often, and that light blue is what's used in the Vista UI for links.

Trouble is, in the context of the awesomebar, that's a lot of light blue, and especially on large monitors it ends up feeling very overpowering.

We should darken the colour. I tried out a bunch of hues, and a simple darkening to 0055bb ended up looking pretty good.

Yeah, it's really subtle, but makes a difference with really bright screens. Thanks, gents!
