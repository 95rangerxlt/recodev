The function toggles the 'tabs from other computers' item on the main history menu, regardless of which menu is displayed. The app button history menu uses the same class (although it doesn't have the menu item in question), and I know of at least one addon that uses it (because I wrote it).

What class does it use?
HistoryMenu (by class I mean in Javascript not CSS, why do these things have to have the same name?)
Well, to be precise, JS doesn't have classes. ;-)
