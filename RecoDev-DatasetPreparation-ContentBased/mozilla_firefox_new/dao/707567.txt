This issue was raised in comments to other bugs:
- bug 666964, comment 13
- bug 689342, comment 8
But neither bug tackled this issue directly, so those comments kinda drowned in the discussion surrounding the somewhat controversial hiding of the http:// from the location bar.

Thus I'm opening a bug specifically for this effect, since bug 666964, which got implemented, mentions adding the http:// "if the first character is included in the selection", and it seems straightforward to extend this to a slightly more rigid condition (and a more logical one): to add the http:// only if at least the full hostname is selected.
