Animation of forward button

Steps to reproduce:
Open two tabs (A,B)
In tab A, navigate to a page and click the back button (thus showing the forward button).
In tab B, make sure that the forward button is not showing.
Give focus to tab A.
Now give focus to tab B.

Expected results:
No animation of the forward button appearing, since the user is not navigating forward/backward.

Actual results:
The forward button appears/disappears with animation. See attached video.

I can confirm it on
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110824 Firefox/9.0a1

This behavior unnecessarily steals user's attention. Is there a way to disable this animation (either for the same tab or tab-switching)? Is there a way to disable conditional forward button and make it always there?

patch

This mostly copies some infrastructure from the winstripe patch. There's more to come in bug 682536.

I also shortened the transition length.
