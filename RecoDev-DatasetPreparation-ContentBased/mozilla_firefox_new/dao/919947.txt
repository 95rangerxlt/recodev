I don't know if it was intentional that bug 919541 prevented closing tabs from being rendered at all (e.g. even when hovered by the mouse). This patch maintains that behavior, but gets rid of the now-redundant opacity setting.

I don't know if layout manages to optimize opacity:0 enough for it to be just as cheap as visibility:hidden. If it doesn't, this might be a slight perf win. I'm therefore picking a medium priority for this bug.
