About two weeks ago something landed that causes my Ubuntu build to have a border that visually separates pinned tabs from the navigation toolbar:

This happens only when toolbar overflows. The regression range is:

Trying to narrow it down further.

Sorry, I mean it happens only when the tabstrip overflows.

This does not happen on Mac or Windows.
Caused by bug 776265.
Adding some people from bug 776265 that hopefully can help investigating this regression.
Bug 776265 was uplifted to 16 so let's look at getting a fix for this or backing bug 776265 out of Beta.
I think bug 776265 / bug 785754 fixed some bug that the tab strip styles
depended on.  I can't reproduce the bug myself (on KDE, OSX), so it's hard
to say.  I would suggest playing around with the styles
(browser/themes/gnomestripe/browser.css is it?), especially anything with
min-/max-height.  This one looks like a candidate:

#tabbrowser-tabs[positionpinnedtabs] > .tabbrowser-tab[pinned] {
  min-height: 18px; /* corresponds to the max. height of non-textual tab contents, i.e. the tab close button */
}

Please elaborate. What bug has been fixed that could affect pinned tabs?
Some classes didn't implement min-/max-height correctly when used in combination
with -moz-box-sizing:border-box.   The error was that the min-/max-height affected
the content-box height, not the border-box height.  I'm not sure exactly which XUL
elements were affected.  For some XUL elements there were also the opposite error,
they got the -moz-box-sizing:content-box case wrong, <xul:image> had this bug for
example.

That said, in this case it seems there is a regression if I'm not mistaken.
Testcase coming up...

I would expect the 1st and 3rd boxes from the top to display the same.
(they do in Fx15)

Tim, does this patch fix the problem?

No, the border is still there, unfortunately.
OK, I spawned a separate bug for my patch, bug 789824.

Seems like layout is behaving correctly here, given -moz-box-sizing:border-box.
Note that winstripe has a similar min-height, set to 16px. Theoretically it would need the same fix, assuming it needs the min-height in the first place, which I think was the case once, but seemingly isn't anymore... Which is good, because this minimum height should be implied by .tab-throbber and .tab-icon-image having a preset height of 16px.

You meant "unaffected": the bug that caused this one was backed out too.
But maybe it should have stayed "fixed".  Who knows.  In any case, "affected" is wrong.

All looks good on the Ubuntu front (17 beta 1) with pinned tabs and normal tabs, no borders above the navigation toolbar.
