Where does the 19px come from? What is it dependent on? Native styling?
There's a native padding or border (which is smaller on XP, hence this bug), the icon container's min-width, the icon size (16px) and the label's margin:

118 .menu-iconic-left {
119   min-width: 1.45em;
120 }

99 .menu-iconic-text {
100   font-weight: inherit;
101   -moz-margin-start: 2px !important;
102   -moz-padding-end: 2px;
103 }

20px would be the sum in my case, but 19 looked better to me. Anyway, the correct formula for XP would probably be this:

-moz-margin-start: -moz-calc(max(16px, 1.45em) + 4px)

but max() isn't supported anymore, so maybe we should do this:

-moz-margin-start: -moz-calc(1.45em + 4px)

There's actually more going on on Vista/7... the icon container has some magic padding which probably comes from widget code.

Can't use a similar formular for Vista/7 due to the magic padding. The icon box width appears to be constant independent of the font size.
