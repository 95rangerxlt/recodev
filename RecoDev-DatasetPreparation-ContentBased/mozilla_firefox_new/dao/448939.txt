patch

r=mano
pushed as changeset 18939:e6b88d928273
This caused a bug in browser.js:

          let location = aRequest.URI;

This was previously declared with the "var" keyword and is used outside the block. Now |if (!msg && (!location || location.spec != "about:blank"))| doesn't have this variable in scope any more and gets window.location instead. Hence the warning "reference to undefined property location.spec".
Note that the patch that was checked in was quite a bit more extensive than the one attached (and reviewed) here...
Yeah, that one didn't apply anymore -- my local up-to-date patch contained more drive-by cleanup.
Dao,

We need the urlbar level attribute back. At a time with Google Chrome breathing down our necks, we need to be giving users more choice, not less. Many users want a yellow urlbar for the https state.

Something like this should work:

#identity-box.verifiedDomain + .textbox-input-box ,
#identity-box.verifiedDomain ~ #urlbar-icons {
  background: ...;
}
