It persists to other tabs in the same window too.

Quite a few sites use window.status, the message persists across all tabs until something else is loaded.

Setting about:config pref

dom.disable_window_status_change

to true

Resolves the problem mentioned in this bug 629964.
Not really a regression, at least not a recent one. I see this bug using the 2010-09-21 nightly (one of the last ones with the status bar) with dom.disable_window_status_change set to false. I don't know why bug 574688 changed the default value of that pref. Maybe we should revert that change.
This was mentioned in bug 574688 comment 54. Backed out that bogus change:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e058817c0ab0


dom.disable_window_status_change unexpectedly set to false by default (DOM status text persists when switching tabs)

regression

Bug 629964 - Make status messages unaffected by JS again, backing out bogus change from bug 574688. a=backout
