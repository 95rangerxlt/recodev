historyUndoPopup leads with two clones.
Ok, I have fixed historyUndoPopup, I'll look for more and fix those as well.

WIP patch

Tried to get all the ids more or less in shape. Since I don't have a build environment set up on Windows, I've submitted this to the try server.

Requesting review early as there's some time pressure (bug 583386 comment 131).

(I did however verify that the browser-places.js changes aren't completely wrong by building locally.)

patch

added missing split-menuitem-item classes
*** Bug 589179 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Wouldn't the missing split-menuitem-item classes break styling significantly?

Reviewing this quickly is kind of hell. I take it all of the items you're changing have been recently added, and don't have any other references (beyond the ones you're updating?).

I've applied your patch and the undo closed tab/window menus work fine. The 'Subscribe to this page' no longer works because the id was changed.

They do on XP (all) and Win7 (classic).

Yeah, except for those that had duplicates that are being referenced, like historyUndoPopup.

Another pre-existing and referenced id, which means it's impossible for both "Subscribe to This Page..." instances to work right now... FeedHandler.updateFeed in browser.js needs an update. If this is the only remaining issue, I'd spin it off to a separate bug.

Haven't encountered anything unexpected so far.

minor last-minute cleanup
Looks like I won't be able to land this right now, but I'll try to make sure it's in the next nightly.
