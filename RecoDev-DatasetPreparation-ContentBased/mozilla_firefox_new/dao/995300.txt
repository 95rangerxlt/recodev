This probably affects all platforms but doesn't matter on OS X where users presumably can't change the system font size.

Quick and dirty. This stretches the icon, which isn't ideal but better than the current situation where the borders don't connect.

Fixing this without stretching the icon would involve moving the button styling from the .toolbarbutton-icon to #forward-button.

What happens when you give the #forward-button > .toolbarbutton-icon a fixed height?

It has an implied fixed height right now, causing this bug.

We'd need to move the styling to the #forward-button indeed.

Even though the stretched icon is visually jarring to me, I still feel it's an improvement, like you said.

Can you file a follow-up for that?

Oops, I imported the patch and meant to make the above change, but then I a got distracted and ended up pushing it unmodified:

I did originally put that comment on the same line on purpose, to make it clearer that it's only for that property rather than the entire rule...
*slap*

I'll let it slide, only this one time... :-P

When the location bar grows vertically due to an increased font size, the forward button should grow as well to match the location bar
