This is intentional, the bar used to not be displayed at all only recently that was changed to give the user a visual aid as to where he was (and to prevent spoofing). However, that window is a pop-up window not to be used for further browsing, to continue browsing close the window and use your regular window.
Is possible but then you need to set dom.disable_window_open_feature.toolbar to true in about:config

The real issue here is that ctrl+t shouldn't open a tab in the popup.

When following the steps in comment 0, I get a popup with a disabled location bar. Pressing Ctrl+T seemingly does nothing. Right-clicking a link and selection "Open in New Tab" appears to do nothing. However, when going to close the window, I get the "Are you sure you want to close 7 tabs?" message. Is that intentional?

Please file a new bug on that. "Open in New Tab" should either be disabled or open a tab in a non-popup window.
