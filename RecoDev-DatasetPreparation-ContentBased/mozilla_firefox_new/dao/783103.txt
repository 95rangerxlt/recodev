In which cases does isElementVisible(gURLBar) return false (assuming gURLBar is non-null)? Is that only when the url bar is on a hidden toolbar? Is gURLBar.focus() always guaranteed to be a no-op in all of those cases?

That and in certain popups if dom.disable_window_open_feature.location is false.

Yes. However, gURLBar.focused can report true if the URL bar was focused when it got hidden and the user hasn't manually focused something else (bug 570835).
Of course, I meant to change flag for my name, not Gavin's
