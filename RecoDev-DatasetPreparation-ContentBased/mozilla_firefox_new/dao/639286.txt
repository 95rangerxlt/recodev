I haven't tested it, but the math is correct.
Forgive me if this is the wrong place to comment on this, but does the tabs still need that border-radius since they are squared now? It causes this bug here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=624225
Removing the border-radius does not cause any difference to me, visually.
(In reply to comment #6)

It causes a difference in the corners. We need the background to overlap part but not all of the border. Bug 624225 will require a different fix.
