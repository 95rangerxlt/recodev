[Triage Comment]
Approving for Aurora 12 to fix this code typo.
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/7d7576bb6814
Is there a test to verify this fix?
This can be tested manually in RTL builds. There's no automated test.

How does one test this fix?
You move the mouse over the status panel.

And what happens if it's still broken?
Nothing.

Okay...then what happens if this is not broken?
The same thing that happens in a non-RTL build (it switches sides).
Sorry guys, I'm a bit confused, and this back and forth is not working for me. Can you please be a bit more explicit?

Here is what I am assuming:
1) Hover over a link
2) On RTL locale, URL displays on bottom-right
3) On LTR locale, URL displays on bottom-left
Mousing over the status panel should make the panel move to the other side of the screen. This bug was about that behavior being broken in RTL builds.
You'd need a link at the bottom edge of the window for that, otherwise you can't try to move the mouse over the status panel while still hovering over the link. It's easier if you load a large page, which will display the status panel as long as the page loads.
You can also tab to a link to get the status panel to show.
Thank you for the clarification.

Checked with Arabian locale Firefox for beta 4 on Mac Os 10.6, Ubuntu 11.10 and Widnows 7.

Loaded planet.mozilla.org. Moved the mouse to the right status panel.
The panel moves to the other side of the screen.
