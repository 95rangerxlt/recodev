Bug 448572 deprecated getBrowser() and getNavToolbox(). However, we're still using them ourselves:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=getBrowser\(|getNavToolbox&regexp=on&find=&findi=&filter=browser%2F|toolkit%2F&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
We might also want to remove those methods from the docs, e.g. http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Special:Nutch?language=en&start=0&hitsPerPage=10&query=getbrowser&fulltext=Search ... (then again, AFAICT both methods seem to have been part of a blessed API for Mozilla browsers at one time, so maybe we shouldn't do that after all)

SeaMonkey/Thunderbird (and perhaps others) also use these... doesn't seem like the simplification is worth the trouble of updating them too (could file bugs instead).

Wow, this was pretty broken. Who reviewed this, anyways? :)

I have no idea whether anyone uses this, or whether it's maintained at all. I suppose these changes don't hurt, but it's possible that people are using it in places that don't have js1.7 features. I'd just avoid changing it (it's self contained anyways).

This kind of test probably belongs under /browser/base (testing/mochitest/tests/browser/ was meant to include tests that test the harness itself), but I guess it doesn't really matter.

I think SeaMonkey uses this too, but it's likely going to move out of toolkit and into SeaMonkey code (bug 425541), so just leave it for now.

These appear to be self contained, so I guess these changes are OK (apart from the printUtils.js-related changes).

I don't know whether this script was meant to be compatible with SeaMonkey, I guess you'd have to ask bc.

File bugs on updating SeaMonkey and Thunderbird or on updating said files?

I would expect it to work still as SeaMonkey sets gBrowser in Startup().

Most of these changes look OK, though the patch has bitrotted. Some that aren't OK:
-printUtils is used by SeaMonkey, so we should avoid the getPPBrowser etc. changes
-I think reporterOverlay is also used by seamonkey (which doesn't use a smart getter for gBrowser)
-toolkit/components/places/tests might be run by seamonkey?

It would probably be easier to review this if it was split into modules (or at least move the browser/ changes into their own patch).


remove getBrowser() and getNavToolbox() usage from the tree
