This is needed for a better tab appearance, e.g. bug 547787 and bug 570279.

This patch has two parts: the actual addition of elements in tabbrowser.xml, and a mechanical change to all instances of browser.css and tabbrowser.css, which is just an automatic replacement of " > .tab-" with " > * > * > .tab-".

updated to trunk
This is necessary for blocking bug 547787, and it affects add-on compatibility, so it needs to block beta6.

v2

Let's clean this up a bit and make it more forward-compatible by adding tabbrowser specific classes and inherting some attributes where it makes sense (preferably with a "tab" prefix, I think, e.g. fadein as tabfadein -- although fadein may be a case where inheriting isn't worth it).
Can you write the patch that does that? You know this code much better than I do.
Blocks a blocker -> blocking+.

Only tested on Linux so far.

This doesn't add tab-background-*. This needs to be done in bug 547787.

tab-icon-image and tab-close-button are already tabbrowser-specific, so I didn't have to invent new classes. For the label I chose tab-label instead of tabbrowser-tab-label or tabbrowser-tab-text as it would be the only class following a tabbrowser-tab-* pattern.

I don't really understand what the differences between these two are supposed to be... tab-close-button is for the buttons on the tabs, and tabs-closebutton is for all the others? Why doesn't this one want to be like the button on the tab? Wish we'd used more distinctive names...

There are .tab-close-button and .tab-label rules in both browser.css and tabbrowser.css, and tab-icon-image rules are only in browser.css - shouldn't this be more consistent?

Why change to vertical-aligning the entire stack rather than just the image?
We should probably get this in sooner rather than later (i.e. in b7).

tabs-closebutton was really supposed to be used only for the tab close button at the end of the tab strip, but it leaked into different places.

Yes, I tried to slightly improve it by leaving only the rules related to the animation in browser.css...

Just the image doesn't work, as the image's parent isn't display:block, but the stack's parent is.
