Feels wrong that we're ditching the colored border here, Stephen's spec has been keeping those : http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups/Control-Center/Control-Center-i01-02.html
We can reconsider when implementing the rest of that design. Right now this looks just wrong and unintentional; e.g. unlike the mockup, we currently neither adjust the color for "https" nor the identity block background on hover.

Looks good, thanks! There is only one fix needed for OS X 10.10 in browser.css:

@media (-moz-mac-yosemite-theme) {
  #urlbar:not([focused="true"]):not(:-moz-window-inactive) > #identity-box {
    margin-top: -2px;
    margin-bottom: -2px;
    padding-top: 4px;
    padding-bottom: 4px;
  }
  #identity-box {
    --identity-box-selected-background-color: rgb(240,237,237);
  }
}

The above #identity-box rule comes before the included shared one and gets overridden. This can be fixed by increasing specificity or by moving this include above the rule:

%include ../shared/identity-block/identity-block.inc.css
