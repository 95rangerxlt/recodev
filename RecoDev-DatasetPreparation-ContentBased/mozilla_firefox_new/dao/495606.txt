How is this related to my work in bug 495226?  In that bug, the highlighted image is used when a new search engine is available to install, not on hovering the search engine button.

This bug maintains the old way of add-engine highlighting. Bug 495226 can still change this.
The "Before" column in attachment 381013 provides another set of screenshots on Vista.
Told Dao that we should try this on trunk, first. a=beltzner for mozilla-central only.

I don't think we want to make this change on branch at this time. We've got the tabstrip acting consistently (buttons glow blue in pressed state) and I'm a little concerned about changing the contrast of the drop-down in the location bar and search bar this close to ship date.

Let's leave in on trunk and see how people feel there. We can always try to port it to a 3.5.x if we fall in love.
