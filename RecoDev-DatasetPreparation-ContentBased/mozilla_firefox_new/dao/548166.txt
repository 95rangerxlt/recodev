the handleLinkClick method contains this code path:

if (event.shiftKey && event.altKey) {
  var feedService = Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/feeds/result-service;1"].
                    getService(Ci.nsIFeedResultService);
  feedService.forcePreviewPage = true;
  loadURI(href, null, null, false);
  return false;
}

The purpose is to skip the feed sniffing code if shift+alt is pressed on a link to a feed.
This feature looks really edge-case, undocumented and most likely rarely (or never) used. It sounds like a debug feature.

Should evaluate if that code should be removed (and evaluate if willing to also remove forcePreviewPage in feedService and feedConverter) or if the docs should be updated.

I wondered why I'd never once heard of that keyboard shortcut, when I've been watching this component for as long as it existed, and patching feed code for longer than that, but apparently I didn't realize that the unreviewed "further work" patch from bug 333751 (where the sum total of the discussion in the bug was the word "further" and the word "work") was actually something that landed, rather than the WIP it sounded like.
looking at addons, i can find 5 of them using forcePreviewPage feature, 2 of them set it to true. So i guess it's better to just remove the hidden browser feature and preserve compatibility.

on the other side, i noticed feeConverter code could need some love, any reason it is not using XPCOMUtils and NetUtil where possible?
Hi, 
  I would like to work on this bug. But I couldn't find the contents given in Comment 0 inside the handleLinkClick method.
Looks like this was fixed by bug 586234 (see bug 586234 comment 11).
