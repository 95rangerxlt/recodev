Noting here since I had to look it up: the removal of gStartupRan in nonBrowserWindowDelayedStartup is OK because it was never really necessary - see bug 631447 comment 87.
(I improperly addressed that comment when updating the "final" patch in that bug - putting it in nonBrowserWindowDelayedStartup rather than nonBrowserWindowStartup.)
Thanks Gavin, I was indeed trying to figure why we put it there!
