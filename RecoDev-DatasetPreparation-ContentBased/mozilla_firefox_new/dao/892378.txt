On a side topic, could we add a migration step that fixes the pre-existing permissions to not have to use this confusing redefinition?

The problem is that indexedDB wants the absence of a saved state to mean "allow" (which by itself is ok, other permissions have the same behavior) but at the same time provide an opt-in "ask me every time" state. We'd have to either stop supporting that option (users could still pick "block" for sites they don't trust) or introduce a new state for it like nsIPermissionManager::ASK_ACTION.
