Steps to reproduce:

1.) Run Trunk
2.) Switch into Fullscreen Mode
3.) Take a look between Tabstrip and window top border


Actual results:

In Firefox 18 there is a little bit space between Tabstrip and window top border. This has the advantage, that the Menu Bar not immediately appears when you move the mouse a little bit higher than the tabstrip is.


Expected results:

Now, there is no space anymore and it happen very often, that I move the mouse curser at the the end of the tabstrip, that the Main Menu appears.

Very annoying, specially when using a Trackpad and/or smaller screens that you always have to be careful to stop the mouse cursor, so that the Menu not appear and the whole tabstrip is unusable until you move the mouse cursor away.

It seems like bug 714186 was regressed or was later changed. See also bug 879607.
