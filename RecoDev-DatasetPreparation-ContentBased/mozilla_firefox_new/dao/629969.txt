(Originally posted in bug 628654 comment #70.)

This change (bug 628654) essentially makes it impossible for anyone trying to do any kind of
full-screen web app, such as they might be doing with our new fast fancy
hardware accelerated graphics support.  The notification bar shows up *all the
time* when you do any kind of XHR request, and is incredibly distracting
because it keeps blinking in and out.

We made the decision very early on to remove the status bar; if we now want to
bring back the status bar, let's do that, but let's not do this half-baked
distracting thing.  We should kill this off IMO, go with the first goals for Firefox 4, and not try to second-guess ourselves in the 11th hour here.

So there are multiple fast requests and the popup appears/disappears repeatedly?
Bug 628654 comment 0 states that "there is a concern that the browser feels slower for that removal since messages about page load status were removed". I'm not sure that's accurate. I can't speak for the people having made this decision, but I think the main concern is that for slow requests, we should give feedback about what's taking long. To that end I'd suggest hiding the popup for the first second or so.
Suppressing status updates for the first second won't help with XHR that e.g. downloads a bunch of bitmaps or data (think Google Body Browser). I think we should leave XHR progress feedback to the web apps.

How about this?

Looks good. I'll give you r=jag too.

I'm not sure if I can use that, but I'll try.
Not sure if attachment 508209 already does that, but --- how about just removing status messages when in full-screen mode, for starters? That should be an easy consensus.
Benoit, would you mind filing a new bug with that proposal? This bug addresses the flickering that comes from XHR (common in web apps) etc., whether you're in full-screen mode or not.

Jag's an old timer, from the dawn of XUL. He's still a SeaMonkey peer, FWIW.
