Buttons added to the Addon Bar currently receive the same styling as those added to the Navigation Bar when in fact the styling should be closer to that of buttons added to the Tab Bar.

Reproducible: Always

Well, then when I put all my widgets down there, what we really need to do this right is update the addon bar so its actually to be styled by the default theme.  

All those things on it to be the styled similarly.  Removing the buttons will just make it more statusbar like, weather its by glass or like the nav or bookmarks bar, themed or by lwtheme.
The plan is to retain some button styling, just not the default navigation bar button styling as those buttons feel cumbersome. I'm sure the UX Team has some ideas on this, if not, I'll be sure to try and come up with a mockup.

Opera styling

Here is how Opera have styled their bottom bar. I propose we mimic the button style.
A mockup would be great, thanks Paul.

Add-on Bar Button Styling Mockup

Apologies for the wait.

This shows the button in their three different states.

Add-on Bar Button Styling Tweaks

I tried to play with the userChrome to get it to look proper, but had problems getting the borders and backgrounds back when hovering over the button. That said, it also raised some user experience concerns in cases of buttons with drop downs. It just didn't look intuitive. Anyway, this is a compromise I came up with.

Can we avoid pushing this until we get UX feedback on bug 609559. As it might negate this work.

No, I certainly don't want to wait for that bug. I don't think it would work for jetpack items anyway.

Then post your argument against it in that bug so as that when the UX Team do review the idea, they're able to take your well grounded arguments into consideration.

It applies on top of bug 604531. Linux should be fine already.

patch

After testing the patch, and loading some add-ons into the bar, I think this needs a couple of pixels on the right margin. The buttons look a bit crunched together otherwise. r=me with that change.

On Windows, Linux, OS X or all of them?

ping?
This was on Linux. I didn't test the patch on Mac or Windows.
Sounds like we should have a separate bug on that. I haven't touched Linux since it doesn't have the button styling that this bug refers to.

Shouldn't the buttons have a hover effect? Not having one gives no tactile response that an icon is actually a button. IMHO this is especially important on the Windows theme, when there is little visual differentiation between a button's enabled and disabled states.

If you're using a classic Windows theme, bug 589236 is the bug you should watch.
