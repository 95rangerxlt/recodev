I didn't actually look at what this code really tries to do, but the code at:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/22805910408e/browser/base/content/browser.js#l3918

seems to be refering to the "location" variable declared at:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/22805910408e/browser/base/content/browser.js#l3897

but at that point the location variable is no longer in scope.

Not sure how severe this is, but nominating so that someone who knows this code can decide.

That patch is fine though I would initialize location with null.

Wouldn't make a difference, right?
