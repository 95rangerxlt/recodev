Depending on the number of tabs open (the size of each tab), some tabs may have a 1px gap between the close button and the tab border, see screenshot attached.

Note that I scaled the screenshot in gimp myself, I donâ€™t think this depends on any scaling related bug.
Markus suggests it may depend on a border-image issue.
I tested the patches in bug 422179, they fixed it.
... which also explains why we don't see this bug on Windows.
Using repeat instead of stretch for the border image might also fix it (and might even be slightly faster).

repeat the middle part

Wouldn't hurt to get this in for beta 6, since bug 422179 apparently won't make it.
