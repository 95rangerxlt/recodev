dropdown styling as I hover over it (on secure site)

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008012004 Minefield/3.0b3pre ID:2008012004

Bug 397331 changed the auto-complete drop-down styling to look like attachment 297257. For me I see this styling on normal sites, but on secure sites when the location bar background colour changes to yellow, hovering the dropdown marker just draws a box around it rather than styles it to look like a normal widget.

I think I would expect it to look as per attachment 297257.

(I don't know if this matters, but I use classic theme in WinXP)

It does matter, because classic themes don't provide a 'toolbox' appearance.

That background color discrepancy between the hovered and non-hovered state is intentional? Looks really weird :/

It is. I think we can do better in the Windows classic case, but that's something for a different bug.
