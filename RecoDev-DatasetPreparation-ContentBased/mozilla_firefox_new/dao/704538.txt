+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #695482 +++

Bug 695482 changed the default for the context menu "Search Google for <selection>" such that the new tab now opens in the foreground. Replies in that bug indicate that this may be disruptive for certain workflows and that the change should either be backed out or an about:config pref added to allow the user to revert to the former behaviour.

In order to make a decision, it was suggested a telemetry probe be added to find out how many people (under the old behaviour) immediately switch to the new tab, after using the context menu search feature.

Assigning to Dao, per conversation on #developers. Thanks Dao! :-)

This isn't worth it. Pick a default, make it possible for an add-on to do something else, and leave it at that. We have much more important things to fix. :)
If you want us to pick the default arbitrarily, I'm leaning towards just reverting bug 695482, as it looks like there was no strong desire for this change while various people are annoyed by it. I don't think we should pick arbitrarily, as it shouldn't be too hard to get data.

What is MOZ_PHOENIX? Ie http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/client.mk#658 true?
MOZ_PHOENIX is set when building desktop Firefox (browser/). I don't think http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/client.mk#658 is relevant here. http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/client.mk doesn't deal with MOZ_PHOENIX at all.

maybe tweak this to mention "within 5 seconds of searching from the context menu"?
