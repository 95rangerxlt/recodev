Review of attachment 8590702:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Can you do another small patch for aboutSessionRestore-window-icon(-aero) , which AFAICT uses the same >= 6 logic but could probably do with being the default, with XP being an override from the other PNG file we use for that? (not the same name)

r=me for all of this, anyway (with thanks to grep and sed and sort and uniq for doing the hard work in this review...)

After observing that hg refused to apply my original hg-generated patch, I made it two patches with straightforward renames like in bug 1150006. I could apply the patches, export them and the renames would still be intact. Now after pushing, I'm amazed to see that the renames from the second patch became file deletions and additions. Great job, hg.

Three comments:
1. Why not just remove all these XP variants? XP is now only used very minimally, and it won't hurt to use the "default" icons across all Windows variants: bug 1154657
2. There are in the three still many images with -aero.png, but no longer used. E.g. Privacy-48-aero.png. These could be removed as well: bug 1154658
3. There are also images, such as toolbarbutton-dropdown-arrow-XPVista7.png which are really the same as the "default" variant: bug 1154660.


Replace "newer than XP" (aka "aero") overrides with XP-only overrides
