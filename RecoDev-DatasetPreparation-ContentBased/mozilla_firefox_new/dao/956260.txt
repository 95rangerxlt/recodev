Bug 897160 set a minimum width on the browser window based on Australis constraints, but landed it in pre-Australis Firefox where the used width is over-zealous and users are understandably complaining about it.

Bug 897160 comment 61 suggests that 250 would be a reasonable value to adopt. I think we should do this on Beta, Aurora and the Holly branch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

We could do this on Aurora and Beta, but I'd rather not do it on Holly because it touches browser/base/content/browser.css and that can make future merges more difficult.

I'm assuming Australis will ship in 29. If it doesn't, we can reopen this and change the status accordingly.
Updated the compat doc accordingly.

Henrik, given in-testsuite-, I'm wondering if this is something we should be testing in-qa-testsuite?

Given the lack of a comment I have no idea why in-testsuite has been denied. I would like to get further information from Dao first.
There was no comment when setting in-testsuite? either. What kind of automated test did you have in mind?
Forwarding this question to Anthony then...

I'm not sure what framework is appropriate but something to ensure the minimum bounds are being respected.
Removing my name from in-qa-testsuite flag for a better query.


Decrease the browser window's minimum width in pre-Australis Firefox
