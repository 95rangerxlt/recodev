changing applications using ALT-tab in full screen mode will not exit the full screen video.  instead, it will switch to firefox and leave the normal view in pause.   With Flash video, it automatically Escapes full screen mode when ALT-TABbing

See screenshot

Repro:
1) install trunk nightly on windows: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2b1pre) Gecko/20091007 Namoroka/3.6b1pre
2) go to a ogg video (eg. see url)
3) Play video, and then right click -> Full Screen
4) When video is in full screen, click ALT-TAB
5) Verify firefox comes to focus, but the FS video is playing in the background, with a frozen normal video in foreground

Actual:
- ALT-TAB a FS video will keep playing in the background behind the application

Expected:
- ALT-TAB a FS video should exit FS mode, just like flash.

To be honest, I prefer the current behaviour over Flash's.  Having dual monitors, it has always bothered me that I can't watch flash video fullscreen on one monitor while interacting with applications on the other monitor.  Even in the single monitor case, I would prefer that the video continued playing fullscreen when I control-tab to another application.  

Why do we think that it is a good thing to copy flash?  I have heard others complain about how flash handles this and doing a google search (http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+fullscreen+dual+monitor) shows many results of people complaining about this and hacks to fix it (including using a HEX editor on the flash dll on Windows)
I guess we could add a hidden pref, but we should optimize this for single-monitor setups first and foremost.

Or detect if there are multiple monitors, but I don't know if there's a reliable way to do that. I think looking at screen.left would work if the video played on the right monitor.

Yeah, a followup on having a pref or (better yet) automagically handling multiple monitors would be the way to go. We should at least take this to fix the single-monitor issue in comment 0.

This may have caused a regression, see bug 530654. Also, no test?
