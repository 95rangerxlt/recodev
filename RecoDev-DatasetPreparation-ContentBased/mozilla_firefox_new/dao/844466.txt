4cb7e17d0e3d	Dão Gottwald — Bug 263433 - 'text-link' XUL widget should open tabs rather than windows. r=enn
Dao - can you investigate the options for this regression vs. intended behaviour?  This doesn't sound like a blocker because I'm assuming people don't go to 'show details' in their history that often but can this happen in other, larger web-breaking circumstances?
The page opens, the tab bar just doesn't update until you close the dialog. I don't think this needs to be tracked. It also doesn't affect web content in any way.
It may not break web content but on closer inspection, we can't predict all the ways this can regress the user experience (and what about addons?) can you look at a potential fix we can get testing around or a backout if necessary?

I don't know what this means.

A backout isn't necessary even if we don't fix this.
IMO this bug doesnt affect normal browsing in any way.
*** Bug 845508 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Just tried reproducing this on FF20 Mac OS X and was not able to.  With a clean profile, clicking on 'details' in show update history opens tab after tab in the background of the dialog window.  QA - can you do some poking around here to determine the platforms affected here?

Might there be add-ons that expect behaviour in a XUL widget to show content in browser tabs even without closing the widget window?

We've already got one dupe and FF20 beta just released last Friday, it looks like this might be more noticeable to users and fixing it worthwhile.
See, browser.preferences.instantApply,
Modal option dialog is  Windows only.
Mac: details link opens in a new window (not affected by this bug)
Win: details link opens in a new tab (affected by this bug)
Lin: details link opens in a new tab (not affected by this bug

This appears to be Windows only.

No, I don't think there's any add-on impact.

It is worth fixing and I'm looking into it, but this may be complicated and, if I get it fixed, too risky to uplift. In that case, I wouldn't consider this issue severe enough to warrant a backout.

Lots of intermittent failures on OS X.

patch v2: start tab opening animation off MozAfterPaint

This uses MozAfterPaint rather than mozRequestAnimationFrame. This would mean that we'd waste a frame before starting the tab-opening animation.

patch v3: start tab opening animation synchronously

This flushes layout and starts the animation synchronously. The layout flush might be redundant, since some previous code in addTab seems to have done it already.

I believe this is visibly more responsive than waiting for MozAfterPaint.

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=f57c2be05c01
Both v2 and v3 are basically green on try, v3 just needs browser_bug585785.js adjusted.

patch v3.1: start tab opening animation synchronously
Marking wontfix for Firefox 20 since the fix seems too risky to be uplifted to beta. Aurora might be feasible if we land it soon.

patch v3.2: start tab opening animation synchronously

Considering where we are in the cycle & based on the fact that we do not know the impact of this not getting fixed for Fx20,lets go ahead with the uplift on aurora and see how it plays out.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/dd308f80fedb
After this bug landed transitionend is not fired if the new tab is move before transitionend

for example:
var newTab = gBrowser.addTab("about:blank", {relatedToCurrent: false});
gBrowser.moveTabTo(newTab, 0);

result:
transitionend event handler is not run and _handleNewTab is not run
