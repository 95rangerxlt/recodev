Gavin, can you point me to the CSS rules that could be applied on the placeholder in the location bar? I wasn't able to find anything relevant :(

I don't understand what you're asking for, but the location bar uses the uri-element-right-align class which used to take care of this.

But that doesn't apply to the placeholder, does it?

If I disable the ::-moz-placeholder CSS properties restrictions, things are working as expected so I think the issue is that something is applied to placeholder isn't working because it is restricted.

It used to, apparently.
May be the removal in bug 810796 was not the right thing to do but it should have been a reordering of items?

As said in the bug, bug 810796 had nothing to do with that bug. When I landed ::-moz-placeholder, I landed multiple patches and the one that made the regression in bug 810796 isn't the same as the one that made this one.
Bug 810796 is about a rule that wasn't correct. This one is about a property that seems to be ignored because of ::-moz-placeholder restrictions.

I need some help from the Firefox team to find out which property should be allowed to make this work and why the searchbar is working while the url bar isn't and if it would be possible to fix the url bar's placeholder to behave like the search bar one.

Unlike the searchbar that contains text from thrid parties, here is very little chance that the placeholder for urlbar would be in a non-RTL locale in a *real* RTL release.

As I said, as opposed to the search bar, the location bar uses the uri-element-right-align class. There's very little code backing that class: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=uri-element-right-align
Apparently "text-align: right" in forms.css used to take care of this but doesn't anymore.
There's also some rules that set "direction: ltr !important;". Maybe that's what's missing?
Mounir - have you made any progress here, or do we need to find a new assignee?

I think someone from the Firefox team would be more appropriate.
Jared - can you help find an assignee? Mounir just passed the puck after a month of being the assignee :)
Is there any reason to keep the uri-element-right-align class?

I'd like to remove it anyways in bug 641238, and some basic testing shows removing it gets everything to look correctly.
We still need the writing direction to be left-to-right.
Alternatively, we could just add text-align:right; to uri-element-right-align.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/forms.css#79 does this (only for non-placeholder text these days), bug 737786 tried to apply it to the placeholder, bug 810796 removed this since it wasn't working.

I'm not quite sure if this gets all edge cases right.

The uri-element-right-align being implemented across browser and layout code is confusing and inconvenient, so I moved everything to layout.

How do you change the UI direction? With the Force RTL addon ?
I reproduced the issue from comment 1 on FF 19b3 with Force RTL addon.
Verified fixed on FF 19b4 Win7, Ubuntu 12.04, Mac OS X 10.7.5.

I also spotted something else while testing this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137995#c7

> How do you change the UI direction? With the Force RTL addon ?

For future reference, the easiest way is to use Force RTL and open a new window after that or restart the browser (IIRC there used to be a few small edge cases that I never bothered to fix with the dynamic direction switch code.)
Verified fixed on FF 20RC Win7, Ubuntu 12.04, Mac OS X 10.7.5.
Verified fixed FF 21b7 Win7
