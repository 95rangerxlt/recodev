testcase that sets the title to the same thing every 5 seconds

I see the notification of a title change when I use Yahoo Mail as an app Tab.  But the title hasn't changed.  (I still have zero new messages.)

To me it seems like Yahoo Mail always sets the title when it checks the server for new messages.  And even if the new title is the same as the old title the notification gets triggered.  

I'm attaching a testcase to prove that.  

1. Load it 
2. make it an App Tab
3. switch to another tab.

Expected:
No notification since the title is not changing.  It is being set to the same string.

Actual:
The App tab notifies that the title changed.  

I heard other things like Google Reader also does the same thing.

Nominating as a blocker, given that the original bug was a blocker, and the original bug as filed is not actually fixed (fixed as in doing what was intended originally - I understand that code was changed).

You could change the setAttribute("crop") to use .crop.

Seems like ideally this would be done at a lower level (i.e. avoid firing DOMTitleChanged entirely in this case), but it's harder to evaluate the compatibility effects that could have. File a followup?

I actually looked into this, but it seemed to me that title_window.xul depended on the current behavior. Now that I look at it again, maybe it doesn't.

Was this supposed to break notifications on gmail?  The title is updated each time a new email is received but now I'm not notified with the red glow.

I don't know what Gmail is exactly doing. Please file a new bug.
It's the same with yahoo mail.


App tabs notify even if title is set but not changed



Bug 593447 - Update the title only if it actually changed. r=gavin 

Bug 593447 followup, set 'crop' property instead of attribute. r=gavin
