We shouldn't add an "item" method to the browsers array -- it's unneeded, doesn't work like NodeList.item() and breaks |for each| and |for ... in| loops.
Furthermore, creating the browsers array can be simplified.

Array.map(this.mTabs, function (tab) tab.linkedBrowser) is throwing a strange exception in the latest trunk nightly, but I can't reproduce in my own build (I suspected it was a regression caused by bug 407216). Please make sure things work OK with an up to date build before landing?

Built with an updated tree and everything worked fine. I think I've seen that exception several times when doing something like Array.slice(gBrowser.mTabs) in the DOM inspector, but long before bug 407216 landed.
