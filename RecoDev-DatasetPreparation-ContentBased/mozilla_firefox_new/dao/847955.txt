Make sessionstore discriminate between recent windows based on privacy status.
Isn't some of the rest of the logic in _getMostRecentBrowserWindow duplicated in RecentWindow? Seems like we could clean this up further.
Er, also RecentWindow.getMostRecentWindow doesn't exist (only RecentWindow.getMostRecentBrowserWindow, which doesn't take a "type" option). Is this on top of some other patch?
Ah, I found bug 847952.

This restricts the search to private windows only, right? Isn't this bug about only public windows?

Also, like Gavin said, there is only a getMostRecentBrowserWindow() function which does the same as SS._getMostRecentBrowserWindow() and we should probably remove a lot of the duplicated code.

This looks like it should enable the desired behaviour while retaining similar semantics to the old code.

RecentWindow.getMostRecentBrowserWindow's logic is a little off:

> function isSuitableBrowserWindow(win) {
>   return (!win.closed &&
>           win.toolbar.visible &&
>           (allowPopups || win.toolbar.visible) &&

>            PrivateBrowsingUtils.permanentPrivateBrowsing ||
>            PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate(win) == aOptions.private));
> }

We need to remove |win.toolbar.visible| so that |allowPopups| actually has any effect.

Looks like we need to consider private windows, too. browser_819510_perwindowpb.js starts failing otherwise. We expect ss.getBrowserState() to correctly return with selectedWindow being a possibly private window.

There might be places where the _getMostRecentBrowserWindow() caller doesn't actually want/need a private window but that requires a little more investigation.

I like that we got rid of some duplicate code but seems we can't restrict the search to public windows easily here.

This should be 'allowPopups'. And we actually do want popups here or else tests start failing.

Sorry, I overlooked that your patch does NOT SKIP popups which is the right thing to do.
You can also remove the BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER #define.

This sounds like something that should be uplifted and have its own bug.

Good catch, thanks.

Yes, I agree, didn't think about uplifting.
