After going into 'Customize(Toolbar)' and clicking 'Restore Default Set', dragging and dropping URLs or text onto the Location Bar no longer replaces the existing text (also auto-submitting it in the case of a URL-link) as it does before doing this, rather it now just adds it to the existing Location Bar text, inserting it whereever the I-beam is when the mouse-click is released.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Confirm drag and drop of a URL-link or text from a webpage into the Location Bar works correctly (ie: replaces the current text, submits it in the case of a link)
2. If it works as expected, now right-click a toolbar and choose 'Customize'.
3. Click the 'Restore Default Set' button
4. Retest step#1



I discovered this while testing the latest Minefield(trunk) build and initially thought this was a recent regression on the Trunk only. However, I just tested it in Firefox 2.0.0.9 (20071025) and it is present there too so it may well have always been broken. I will test some old release builds and see if there was a regression window.

I can confirm that it was "broken" on Firefox 2.0.0.1, and even 1.5.0.7 (2006090918) so as nobody reported it since then, it was probably always broken but nobody noticed. The only reason I came across it was I was looking at Bug 403959 after running across a problem with the new implementation of the Minefield toolbar resizer.
ok, I'll take this
This is almost certainly because the dragdrop handlers get set in delayedStartup, not actually in the xul element:

No, but if that means that such blockers actually exist, I'll have a look at them.
