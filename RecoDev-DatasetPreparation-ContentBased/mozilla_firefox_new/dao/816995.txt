As long as this doesn't cause the tabs to be open in the background in some configurations, it looks to me like it won't though.

It seems to me you could set inBackground to false or fromChrome to true, either of which would work (I didn't look to see why you have two ways to do this; as it happens SeaMonkey works slightly differently, it uses a "tabfocused" target instead.)

openUILinkIn always sets fromChrome to true when calling openLinkIn.
