patch

I couldn't reproduce this bug with my default profiles on Windows and Linux, but I can reproduce it with a new profile on Linux. delayedStartup appears to be racing with the initial window being focused, and gURLBar.focused will only be true once the window is focused.

Seems ok, as long as the extra call to mouseoverToggle and select() is acceptable.

FullScreen.mouseoverToggle will only be called when starting up in fullscreen mode, and return early because the fullscreen UI isn't set up at that point. select() can be avoided if deemed worthwhile, see bug 783064 comment 1.
