This is a regression in the new theme on Linux.

Both the location bar and the search bar borders should use GTK colors. For example, when using the Gilouche GTK theme (default in Novell SLED and OpenSUSE's GNOME), the border should be #bca775, but it's #96969d.

This was correct in 1.5 and before the theme changes in 2.0.

Also, on focus the border color also should change to another one, though this wasn't working 1.5.

Latest tinderbox build and another GTK app for comparison.
That's because it was decided that the border should match the end caps (bug 351195). I favored using ThreeDShadow instead of #96969d, but I was alone.
Oh, so this was done on purpose? :-o

Count me in as Marek's backup. I don't want to enforce my hatred for non-standard colors/widgets on anyone. But I HATE when others enforce their "my widgets are better" position on me.

I've chosen a GTK theme. Now please respect my choice and use the standard colors, please...

In the screenshot attached, the problem of input look is even more apparent. And I'll pretend not to see what's been done with tabs. :)
If the endcaps can be made to automatically use system colors in their borders, we can certainly change this.  Regardless, though, the endcaps and the rest of the border need to match -- a consistent, non-native color is better than having pieces of the line be one color and pieces be another.

Since the endcaps are images, this is going to be a bit difficult to get right.  Dao has had some ideas that might be suitable for trunk.  This will not be changed in Firefox 2.
Can't you use CSS borders and -moz-border-radius for the endcap?

I did try that (bug 351195 comment 31). With Gecko 1.8, border-radius is too jittery.
