testcase
this only seems happens when browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab is set to false
I confirm the bug, and it's surprising to me. Doesn't block because it only appears under non-standard configuration, but I would like to see it fixed regardless!
I'm getting these errors:

Warning: reference to undefined property this.tabContainer
Source File: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml
Line: 89

Error: this.browsers[i] is undefined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml
Line: 253

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsIObserverService.addObserver]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: prepareForStartup :: line 5283"  data: no]
look like that the problem is in gBrowser.tabs
changing tabs from field to property fix the porplem

-     <field name="tabs" readonly="true">
-       this.tabContainer.childNodes;
-     </field>

This is more expensive, though. I don't really see what's wrong with the <field>. I also don't understand how the closeWindowWithLastTab pref affects this.
set browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false and browser.tabs.closeButtons=1

tabbrowser-tabs constructor call adjustTabstrip 
adjustTabstrip call _numPinnedTabs

then in _numPinnedTabs this.tabs is undefined
(In reply to comment #7)
> tabbrowser-tabs constructor call adjustTabstrip 
> adjustTabstrip call _numPinnedTabs

This explains why closeWindowWithLastTab makes a difference. Thanks!
This leaves the question of why tabbrowser.tabContainer.childNodes fails when called from the tabContainer constructor.
not tabbrowser.tabContainer.childNodes fails tabbrowser.tabs fails.

tabContainer constructor calls tabbrowser.tabs that calls tabbrowser.tabContainer.childNodes.

this loop of tabContainer > tabbrowser > tabbrowser.tabContainer from tabContainer constructor don't look so good to me

the simple fux will be to move the call to adjustTabstrip from tabContainer constructor to tabbrowser constructor

> not tabbrowser.tabContainer.childNodes fails tabbrowser.tabs fails.

That's essentially the same.

> tabContainer constructor calls tabbrowser.tabs that calls
> tabbrowser.tabContainer.childNodes.
>

> tabContainer constructor don't look so good to me

It's circular, sure, but this doesn't mean it should fail...
i guess that it fail in this circumstance since tabbrowser is not ready when tabContainer  try to call it.
I imagine tabbrowser should automagically become ready when it's accessed, but maybe XBL bindings can't be constructed concurrently or something.

fix

This is the right thing to do anyway. No point in trying to measure the tab width if there is only one tab.

Dennis, please don't remove my whiteboard tag.  I'm using [switch-to-tab] to track all bugs which affect switch-to-tab.
I removed it because it doesn't have anything to do with switch to tab.  And since you cannot edit popup's switch to tab doesn't apply to them.

This bug has an affect on switch-to-tab as per the duped bug in comment 21.
It affected countless random things, as it broke the popup's whole chrome... Please don't add them all to the whiteboard.

I don't track all areas...I track switch-to-tab.  Having the whiteboard tag will help me track this.  Please don't remove the tag again.  It has no affect on your work with this bug.
Please track bug 586054. Mark it fixed by this one or something.

This is no switch-to-tab bug. It's also mine. Please stop messing with it.

Please explain to me the harm having my whiteboard tag in this bug causes?

I am tracking bug 586054.  However, there is no dependency tree so this bug will get lost without me using the whiteboard tag.  It's really a necessity for me.
Can you guys sort this out outside of bugzilla - ideally with voices (if not faces) involved? This is a bugzilla slapfight right now, and you are all, each one of you, above it.
It's resolved. Bug 586054, blocked and fixed by this one, is the switch-to-tab bug to track. This avoids the confusion of tagging a non-switch-to-tab bug with [switch-to-tab].

People build and read bug lists in various ways and for various reasons. Stuff you put in the whiteboard can mislead them, since it isn't private. In this case it would have lead me to believe that I worked on a switch-to-tab bug when I didn't. If you don't expect others to understand and use your tags, you can avoid this by obscuring them.


Chrome messed up in popup windows when closeWindowWithLastTab = false

regression

Bug 583000 - Don't try to measure the tab width if there is only one tab. Fixes broken popup windows with browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false where accessing tabbrowser.tabs during the construction of tabbrowser-tabs would fail. r=gavin
