what's the point of this change?  I'm pretty sure its marginally slower.  substr or indexOf are about the same speed, regex for straight strings is overkill.
I think ideally the regex would be compiled once and could be even faster then. But I don't really care either way, I just thought it was cleaner (more compact).
An indexOf check is as compact as a regexp test and shouldn't be slower than the current code.
Yeah, my first thought was to use indexOf, but then I realized that scanning the entire string is waste -- we don't want to know the index but if the strings starts with "about:neterror?". So substr makes a little bit more sense, as well as the regex.

I doubt we are talking significant (if any) savings here but I tend to program this as

targetDoc.documentURI.lastIndexOf(aboutNeterr, 0) != 0
