The only part of bug 541656 that could reasonably affect page load time is this part, as far as I can see:

... the opacity transition in particular.

I pushed the attached patch to Try, WinXP numbers went from 358 to 338:

Rather to 336. The rerun results don't show up on tbpl for whatever reason.

You can get the average of the reruns with this script (which I just run in Scratchpad):

While this is a nice win, it's still not the entire regression that I found.

If you're not doing a transition on opacity anymore, can you make the statuspanel display:none when it's not needed? That would reduce overhead when it's not visible.

The transition is still there for link target URLs.

If the overhead is substantial, we could probably replace that transition with a longer delay, after which the panel would appear immediately.

I tested display:none instead of opacity:0 on the try server:

This seems to be no win for tp4 at least:

When a page is loading, the status panel should appear immediately rather than being faded in (affects page load time)
