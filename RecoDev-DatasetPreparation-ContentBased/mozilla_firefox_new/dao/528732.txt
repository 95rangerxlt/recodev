This is similar to bug 528440. I don't know if this makes a difference in practice, but better safe than sorry.

I think we should probably just fix bug 528706 rather than spread this stuff around to all of our uses of the window mediator.
Bug 528706 isn't going to solve it for this case, unless it covers the enumerator functions as well.
Yes, I was assuming we'd fix them all.
Well, Marco said the legitimate use for the enumerator not skipping these windows was bug 528469, and in contrast to getMostRecentWindow, I think it's more likely that there are others.
i think changing the enumerator is more complex than changing getMostRecentWindow, exactly because it enumerates all existing windows objects and that can be useful in some situation, and some code could rely on it.
But we could change the enumerator API to get an optional param onlyOpenWindows, with a false default to preserve old behavior.
I'm also going to use getEnumerator to find closed windows in bug 528776.
