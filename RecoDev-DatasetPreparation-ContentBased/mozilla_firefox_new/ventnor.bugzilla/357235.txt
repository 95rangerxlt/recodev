What's wrong with adding the menuitem right after creation?

> +	undoPopup.appendChild(m);

Please watch your tabs.

Does this work correctly for you? I thought that we had already tried this but it failed for whatever reason...

Nope. My testing showed that the key attribute could not be changed after the menu item was appended. However, by separating the two functions, it still works correctly and the key attribute could still be applied.

Patch w/o tabs

Crap, I hate it how Notepad++ fills in tabs for you. Anyone know how to change it?

Patch w/o tabs

Works as expected. It does however look slightly strange when there's hardly any space between the most recently closed tab's title and Ctrl+Shift+T -- which happens when only one tabs has been closed or when it's got the longest title from the list. Might still be worth taking though (at least for further evaluation on Trunk).

There have been changes to the section which affects this patch (read: I broke my own patch with bug 344140). Updated the patch.

r=mano code-wise.

Patch v2

Let's try this for now. It might look awkward, but I'm not sure the other alternative (adding an "Open last closed tab" command to the History menu beneath the "Recently Closed Tabs" submenu) is any less awkward :)

Wow, its been almost a year since the last patch.

For checkin

This has been sitting around too long.  It's a simple, obvious fix, and we should get it in.  Requesting approval to land this for M9.  If approved, I'll check it in and then take responsibility for dealing with regressions.
Please re-request checkin-needed once approval1.9 has been granted.
