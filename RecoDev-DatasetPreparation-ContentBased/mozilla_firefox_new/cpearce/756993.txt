If you enter fullscreen in domain A which is approved for fullscreen, and then quickly enter domain B which isn't, the "A is now fullscreen" warning will have a timer to auto-hide the warning which isn't reset when we reset the strings to reflect B now being fullscreen. In other words, we'll auto hide the B's approval UI, even though B was not approved for fullscreen.

We should not; explicit approval should be required.

Patch: Reset fullscreen approval UI each time fullscren is entered.

Reset the auto-hide and fade out transition attributes when reconfiguring the fullscreen warning/approval UI when a domain enters fullscreen. This means the timeout from an approved domain won't cause the approval UI to hide on a unapproved domain.
