After bug 1090949 (I think), disabling a simulator from the Add-on Manager page leaves it in the WebIDE runtime list forever.  Effectively, disabling has no effect.

I believe this is because WebIDE now searches out simulators by regex, effectively ignoring the add-on manager's info, since it now only needs file locations on disk and does not care about code the add-on would have run.

STR:

1. Open WebIDE
2. Look at runtime list
3. Open about:addons
4. Disable some simulator add-on
5. It will still be displayed in the runtime list

Jan, I marked this as a regression mostly for tracking purposes.  I could imagine an argument that we don't care about this and decide to do nothing.  However, if it's easy to fix, we may want to do, as it's a little surprising.

Assigning and setting ni? since you'll be out a few days.
Nice catch. Like for bug 1149214, this happens because the list is currently generated directly from what `AddonManager.getAllAddons()` returns, including disabled addons.

This will be fixed when bug 1090949's last patches get merged, because they improve the way this list is updated.
Does this problem still occur?

No, it seems to be fixed now, thanks!


Disabled simulator still appear in WebIDE runtime list
