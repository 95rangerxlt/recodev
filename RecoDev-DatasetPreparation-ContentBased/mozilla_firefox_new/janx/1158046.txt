Currently, a few context menu items don't have access keys in the Network panel, e.g. when right-clicking on a resource, you can't trigger "Copy as cURL" or "Copy Request Headers" from the keyboard.

We should add access keys to more (maybe all) context menu items so that they can be executed faster.

Add access keys to all context menu items in the Network panel.

I improved the netmonitor request item context menu a little, by adding access keys for all entries, and using a more sensible order / more separators.

Here is what the proposed context menu looks like.

The code changes seem fine to me.  Forwarding the hard part (deciding whether the accesskey choices and menu organization is OK) to jsantell.  Jordan, this screenshots illustrates the updated context menu: https://bug1158046.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8602175

All looks good to me! How are these access keys shown anywhere? How would someone know "U" copies the URL?

Can also directly use the `Array.forEach` static method for this
Thanks!

The usual way to show access keys is to underline their letters in each option: https://bug1158046.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8602175

I believe that's the same prototype method that `[].forEach` accesses.

Well, actually not. Fixed.
