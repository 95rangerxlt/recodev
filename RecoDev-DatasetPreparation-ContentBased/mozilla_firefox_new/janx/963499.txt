Move this one upper. Closer to the top of the method.

After playing with it, I decided to show the number of milliseconds instead of a jank count, much more useful that way. Also I find the actor threshold to be very low, thus tracking janks produces a lot of logs in ADB!

I thought I landed something which is 100ms by default but I landed something else :(

I will try to fix bug 968237 as soon as I can in order to unlock this feature.

Well, technically this feature isn't blocked on bug #968237, and I'm not sure it should be blocked on bug #969827 either. The current situation with a threshold >=20ms is that you see a lot more updates and logs, but it's still useful.

I suggest we don't block on those bugs and land now. Does that work with you Vivien?

I'm fine to land it as if. People are still able to configure the interval in the meantime using MOZ_INSTRUMENT_EVENT_LOOP_THRESHOLD and MOZ_INSTRUMENT_EVENT_LOOP_INTERVAL in system/bin/b2g.sh if they need to tweak it until the pref has landed.

I add to rebase the Gaia patch. Here is the changeset https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/commit/1a3d4629fb59c5b1e63e158b05777fd1c9c11a80
Thanks for rebasing :)
Mike, I'm curious about those whiteboard values, what are they for?
Hi Jan,

We use those whiteboard values to populate our agile view, scrumbugs: https://scrumbu.gs/p/fxos-perf/

c=<component>, a performance-specific categorization (e.g. memory, power)
p=<point-value>, a value from 1 - 5 indicating Level Of Effort to fix this issue.
s=<sprint-name>, usually only used for bugs resolved before being added to a sprint.
u=<release/device>, used to indicate which release(s) or this is for (e.g. 1.3, 1.4, tarako) usually set when an issue is marked as a blocker.

Mike
Thanks Mike!
