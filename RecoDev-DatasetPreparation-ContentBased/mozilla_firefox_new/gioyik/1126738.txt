In browser/base/content/browser-data-submission-info-bar.js, there are a few cases of inline functions using bind(this) that can be simplified by replacing:

  function () {
    ...
  }.bind(this)

with:

  () => {
    ...
  }

or, as another example:

  function foo(bar) {
    ...
  }.bind(this)

with:

  bar => {
    ...
  }
