Maybe dropdown.svg can be used (except it needs to be backwards). Also, that asset is high contrast friendly.

Maybe dropdown.svg can be used (except it needs to be backwards). Also, that asset is high contrast friendly.
To fix this bug, you need to remove sorter.png and sorter@2x.png from [0]. And in [1], you need to replace sorter.png with dropdown.svg and remove 2dppx rule later in the file (line 702). On line 698, you'll need to replace [sortDirection="descending"] with [sortDirection="ascending"]

Thanks for the patch !

Whoops, I forgot to mention you had to remove the references to sorter.png and sorter@2x.png in the toolkit/themes/(windows|osx|linux)/global/jar.mn

Other than that, the changes look good. Btw, as I mentioned in the other bug you took, I'm not a peer, so my review is worth nothing (but I can still give feedback), you should ask :jaws for your next review :)

Thanks for the new patch :)

Usually bugs are mentored by peers, so you can directly request review to the mentor, but there are some exceptions ;)

There are some references for aero later in the file that you need to remove as well.

Were you able to test that your changes worked before requesting review? Please test your changes and ask questions that you have while working on it. You can join #introduction on irc.mozilla.org to ask questions about getting your build running, or you can follow the steps at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build to build Firefox.

With this patch there are no arrows in the Preferences > Applications > richlistbox. This is because the selector needs to reference chrome://global/skin/in-content/dropdown.svg#dropdown instead of just chrome://global/skin/in-content/dropdown.svg.

Also, the size of the arrow is too small at height:8px, width:12px. The SVG here is square, and we can use width:16px; height:16px; for it.

16px feels a bit small to me. Maybe 18px like the menulist dropdown icons ?

Hi,

I created the patch again with a latest mozilla-central source. Could you test it again? And if it fails again, could you tell me exactly what is the problem or where it is failing?

Thanks
Since this is just a rebasing problem, just set checkin-needed again.
