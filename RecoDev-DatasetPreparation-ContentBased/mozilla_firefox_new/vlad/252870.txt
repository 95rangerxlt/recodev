If I right-click in the bookmarks toolbar over a bookmark button, a
bookmar-folder button or a separator, the context menu shows (amongst other
things) the items:
- "New Bookmark..."
- "New Folder..."
- "New Separator" (maybe this one is introduced in recent nightlies, not sure)

If you right click somwhere right beside these buttons, where the bookmarks
toolbar is empty, only "New Folder..." is shown. It does not make any sense to
need to move the mouse over a existing bookmark button, bookmark-folder button
or seperator.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
If the user clicks right somewhere in the empty area of the bookmarks toolbar,
also the context menu items "New Bookmark..." and "New Separator" should be shown.

... to be able to insert new bookmarks or separators.
patch in on aviary, trunk soon (once bookmarks stuff gets moved over)

http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/bonsai/cvsquery.cgi?module=AviaryBranchTinderbox&branch=AVIARY_1_0_20040515_BRANCH&cvsroot=/cvsroot&date=explicit&mindate=1090724100&maxdate=1090724640&who=vladimir%25pobox.com

Note that you now get a nice useless "Expand" menu item when right-clicking in
empty areas -- which is consistent with the equally useless Expand menu item you
get when right-clicking a folder in the menu, or a folder in the toolbar. 
However, you can now right-click on an empty part of the ptf and select open in
tabs to get the entire toolbar contents opened in tabs, which is neat.
The proper context menu comes up when clicking on an empty area of the BTF as
seen on 0.9+ branch builds from 0726.
patch in on branch/trunk.

I just have tested
"Firefox-win32.zip 29-Jul-2004 11:06 5.8M":

There non of the three New...-items is shown in empty bookmarks toolbar area!

"patch in on branch/trunk."
Should the nightly above already have this fixed?

Please forget comment 5.
In "Firefox-win32.zip 30-Jul-2004 09:59" it is fixed.



(But bug 253079 remains.)
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


in the context menu of empty parts of the bookmarks toolbar the items "New Bookmark..." and "New Separator" are missing
