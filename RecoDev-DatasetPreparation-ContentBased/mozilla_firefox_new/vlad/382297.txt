We moved to a single pdb file per object file in bug 286179 to make parallel builds work.  With Visual Studio 2005/VC8, this is no longer necessary -- there's a separate server process that manages all access to pdb files, and we're actually slowing down debug builds now.

Before backing out this patch, when linking layout in a debug build, mspdbsrv gets to upwards of 500mb and takes around 3-4 min on my laptop.  After backing it out, it doesn't go above 100mb and takes about 1.5 min to link.

go back to using a single PDB per library

Go back to using a single PDB per library.  This will break -jN builds on anything less than VC8.  I think that's fine, because anything less than VC8 isn't supported, yes?
Do we need VC8SP1 for this? I know that we haven't seen the slowdowns of mspdbsrv on the original release of VC8 (which many people are still using, including the tinderboxen).
Hm, not sure; I have SP1 installed.

Doh, I thought vc71 was still supported, just not what the official builds were made with.
VC71 still works (and would continue to work with this patch as long as you don't use -jN)... we don't test it, and if it breaks we'd expect people who care to provide patches.

Bumping this to Ted for investigations.
vlad: have you seen this:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935225 ?  It's a hotfix for MSPDBSRV on VC8SP1.

If not, can you try it out?  Also, I saw something (can't remember where) that led me to believe that VC71 might have mspdbsrv as well.  I don't have it installed (just VC2k3 Toolkit), but maybe bent can investigate.  I think it lives in Common7\IDE.

r=me, we could use a comment on a build page somewhere mentioning that make -jN + vc7.1 will be broken.
Checking in config/rules.mk;
/cvsroot/mozilla/config/rules.mk,v  <--  rules.mk
new revision: 3.563; previous revision: 3.562
done

How does this affect developers, so I can document this?
I guess the dev-doc-needed is only in reference to comment 8. We don't officially support Visual C++ 2003 on the trunk anyway (I don't think), so maybe it's not an issue.
Added a note about this here:

Bug 382297 - use a single PDB file per library (back out 286179)

Bug 462740 - Building spidermonkey on Windows with -j3 fails: conflicts in PDB files. Related to bug 382297 and bug 286179, where we flip-flop back and forth about this. Document the way things should actually be!
