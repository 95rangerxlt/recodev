(There might already be bug filed for this, but I can't find it in 15-20 min of
searching, so.)

If a favicon is loaded from favicon.ico instead of a link, the favicon in the
urlbar doesn't come back from the generic one after switching away from the tab
because we don't set the mIcon attribute on the listener.  (see comment #14 in
bug 181872 -- this doesn't fix 181872 though.)
