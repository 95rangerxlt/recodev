Here're the issues I got about Livemarks so far...

The following feeds, which are in non-UTF8 I mentioned before, could not be
displayed correctly after parsed...
1) http://frostyplace.com/rss.php (0.9 Big5 Feed)
2) http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/xul.rdf (1.0 Shift-JIS Feed)
3) http://www.w3cn.org/article/rss.xml (2.0 GB2312 Feed)

The following feed is listed in descending order...
1) http://frostyplace.com/rss.php (0.9 Big5 Feed)

The following feed is failed to load, but its structure should be able to parsed.
1) http://phpbb.elixus.org/rdf.php (0.9 Big5 Feed)

And it's possible to Open, Open in New Window and Open in New Tab via
contextmenu in the item "Livemark feed failed to load".

And one more issue, it seems I experienced slow loading of favicons in the
bookmarks. Is this related to this bug?

non-UTF8 rendering case.

A misunderstanding of what the ParseString routines are doing; they individual
rdf/dom parsers will honor encoding in the ?xml themselves, no need to do it
ourselves (which just horribly confuses the issue since we still passed the
original encoding in the ?xml).  (nsIDOMParser::ParseUTF8String should probably
get renamed to ParseCString.)

This fixes all the feeds referenced on this page; however, some of the asian
langauge feeds still don't display correctly in menus -- you get the unicode
hex slugs.  The conversion is correct, though, as manually converting with
iconv to utf8 and viewing in an editor gives the exact same hex slugs for me :)
 I'm assuming this is a font issue; I'm not sure how to fix.

Font woes are solved by installing better fonts, I'm sure.
patch is in on aviary (I swear I resolved this bug already, I bet I resolved
another one by accident..oops)
