There is an inconsistency between the menu new item additions and the bookmarks
manager and sidebar new item additions. In the menus the new item is correctly
added _below_ the selected item (with the exception of menus which is a bug). In
the Bookmarks Manager and the Bookmarks Sidebar, new items are incorrectly added
above the selected item. Tested with the latest aviary branch build on windows XP.

RDFContainer seems to inconsistently renumber when inserting an element at a
position that's already occupied by another -- if it's the last element, it gets
pushed forward so that the "new" thing comes before the last element. 
Otherwise, it correctly inserts after the thing.

I'm going to check in a patch to always add new items at the end of the parent
container, regardless of the position of the selected item -- though it's not
ideal, it's better than having the behaviour be wildly inconsistent.  I'll take
a look at doing the real fix with RDFContainer.
patch in on aviary, trunk soon

As seen on 0.9+ branch builds from 0726 items are now added at the end of the
list in the parent container.

This is a partial backout of the previous patch, and a small fix.  With this,
everything seems to work like it should -- items are always getting added to
the end.  So, I'd like to get this in.

sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


in sidebar and bm manager new items should be added below selected item, not above. inconsistent behavior across bookmarks manager, sidebar, and menu.
