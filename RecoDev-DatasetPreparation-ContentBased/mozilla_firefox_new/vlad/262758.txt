I just realized today that on every live bookmark reload, we end up "leaking"
the resources that were in use for the previous set of items.  Right now, we
just remove the items from the parent container.  Since internally everything
gets stored in an InMemoryDataSource, the old triples (rdf:$anon -> Name -> ...,
etc.) are still in the data source, they're just not in any bookmark container.

The fix is to grope all outbound arcs from each rdf:$anon item, and unassert
each one.  Patch soon.

This patch clears out all the arcs whenever we remove a bookmark item; note
that looking at this, we have the same kinds of leaks whenever a user removes a
normal bookmark -- the resources and literals still stick around in the rdf
datasource, until the user quits and restarts.	This isn't as big of a deal,
because deleting bookmarks isn't that common of an operation, but it should be
fixed at some point.

This also seems to have the nice side effect of making the "Open in tabs" menu
item less broken with live bookmarks; if the menu is open when the load
finishes, the items appear, but "Open in tabs" doesn't appear -- it appears the
next time the menu is selected.  We don't, however, get the separator and other
 stuff appearing in weird places, etc.

sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
