in bug 1110982, we are looking to enable tests where we run a fresh browser instance per directory.  Usually what happens is that a few tests fail because they accidentally depend on the state of the browser from an earlier test.

In the try run:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=1a5fa04f057a

In the linux opt/debug oth chunks, the test fails as following:
 1111 INFO TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | dom/tests/mochitest/localstorage/test_localStorageQuotaPrivateBrowsing_perwindowpb.html | Test timed out. - expected PASS

this reproduces locally for me on linux64:
./mach mochitest-chrome dom/tests/mochitest/localstorage/

here is some console output where I have hit ctrl+c to terminate it:

odd, I can't get this running at all locally, maybe there is something else required to run this test.
this continues to be a problem, you can see it on linux opt (waiting on results from other jobs):
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=8e4065c13a17

I ran this on a linux 32 vm (just downloaded the bits and did it all manually) and was able to reproduce it.

When looking at this, I see that we get into case 1 where we want to set slave.location:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/tests/mochitest/localstorage/test_localStorageQuotaPrivateBrowsing_perwindowpb.html?from=test_localStorageQuotaPrivateBrowsing_perwindowpb.html&case=true#57

the problem is that after doing that slave.location remains about:blank.  Maybe we are setting data on the wrong window, maybe there is some small thing that has changed which requires us to do an extra step to change the location of the private browsing window.

One other quirk here is that when we are trying to set the location on the slave, we believe it is the content_page, but in fact the UI looks to be about:blank (or whatever the default private browsing page is)

Ehsan, is there anything you could suggest we do to work on this issue?

This test uses a custom version of testOnWindow, which doesn't wait for about:privatebrowsing to be loaded on the new window.  That may be the reason behind this issue.

One thing that can be tried here is to copy the testOnWindow and whenDelayedStartupFinished functions from <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/tests/mochitest/beacon/test_beaconCookies.html> and use them in this test (by basically replacing its testOnWindow implementation.)

update test to use a more modern testonwindow (1.0)

tested this locally, it would fail 100%, now it passes.
