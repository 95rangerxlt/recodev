We have a promise rejection that we fail to handle while running /browser/devtools/framework/test as a directory (done in automation with --run-by-dir):
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=cd46f76e9763&searchQuery=devtools

Luckily fixing this one issue gives us a lot of green and the ability to change the way we run tests in automation to use run-by-dir:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=e24b4a171489

This is easy to reproduce locally and it is easy to fix by just adding:
thisTestLeaksUncaughtRejectionsAndShouldBeFixed("TypeError: this.doc is undefined");
