In swapBrowsersAndCloseOther, poke the findbar after giving it a value, to enable buttons

Thanks Alice!

Bug 890595 fixed this for other cases, but when we move a tab to a different window, we open the findbar without running findbar.startFind().  This does it via findbar.onFindCommand() after we set the _findField.value.

Also adds a test.

While testing for the pre-beta sign-off of the Find Bar Redesign feature, I tried to verify this bug with the latest Aurora (build ID: 20130903004001) and the prev/next is performed in the de-attached window.

The search however, is not always accurate, sometimes choosing prev/next in the de-attached window will select the first result in the page, and not the precedent/subsequent outcome of the result found before detaching the tab.

Is this the expected behavior or should I file a new bug for this? Thank you
