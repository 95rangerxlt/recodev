Thanks to William's observer service memory reporting (bug 903290) I've noticed that the number of registered profile-before-change observers appears to grow without bound after a few hours of using Firefox.  From my current session:

430,006 (100.0%) -- observer-service
└──430,006 (100.0%) -- referent
   ├──428,512 (99.65%) ── strong
   └────1,494 (00.35%) ++ weak

427,812 (100.0%) -- observer-service-suspect
├──422,529 (98.77%) ── referent(topic=profile-before-change)
└────5,283 (01.23%) ++ (5 tiny)

After setting a breakpoint in a debugger I noticed that the callstacks to AddObserver are all coming from TabStateCacheTelemetry.  Sure enough, it has code to attempt to initialize only once (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/38950e6974b9#l1.103) but it never actually sets this._initialized!

bz and I have both seen extremely lengthy shutdowns caused by attempting to fire hundreds of thousands of profile-before-change observers.  This also makes about:memory super-janky when it tries to count all of them.

Oops.
