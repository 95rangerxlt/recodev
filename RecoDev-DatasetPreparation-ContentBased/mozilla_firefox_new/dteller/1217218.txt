Possibly fallout from bug 1208747?
Most likely, yes.
I'll wait until we have a few more samples to determine what's going on.
This is happening very frequently, across a number of test suites.

Well, all ASan. I just meant, in different mochitest chunks.

Do you have a fix for this, or should bug 1208747 get backed out? Thanks.
I still have only a single log to work on, so there are only so many things I can do at this stage. Andrew, is it always a leak of a single PerformanceGroup?

However, based on this log, it looks like a single js::PerformanceGroup is leaking. There are very few structures that can hold references to a js::PerformanceGroup:
- a JS Compartment holds one (released when the compartment is destroyed);
- a JS Runtime holds a few (any leaking reference is released when the JS Runtime is destroyed);
- the nsPerformanceGroupService holds one.

There are also a few references on the stack.

Could it be possible that a single JS Compartment is never garbage-collected?

Could it be possible that we finish the process from a nested event loop which prevents the stack-based reference from being released?
Oh, I missed some information. I see which reference is not collected, I hope to have a patch shortly.

I believe that's not available with the new modal interface. (bug 1153105)

I don't think this is really MemShrink, as solving this bug won't change the memory footprint of Firefox by a single byte.

It obviously isn't a major issue, but maintaining the integrity of our memory testing infrastructure is an important part of monitoring Firefox's memory usage.

Bug 1217218 - Consolidating shutdown of nsPerformanceStatsService;r?froydnj

In e10s tests, the content process version of nsPerformanceStatsService doesn't always shut down correctly. Apparently, this is due to content-child-shutdown not always being received - or possibly just
not being received on time. We fix this by extending shutdown to also shutdown the service in reaction to xpcom-will-shutdown. This raises an additional issue with JS code being able to request a
snapshot after shutdown of the service, so we add a sanity check to ensure that such calls always fail once the service is shutdown.
