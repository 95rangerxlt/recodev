Write nsSearchService cache with OS.File

Do we have test coverage here?
I don't think we do. I'll try and find out how to add some.
So, for the sake of testing, I could send a notification "cache-built" or something such. Gavin, do you think it's worth the bother?
If that's all that's needed to get test coverage for cache population that we otherwise don't have, that certainly sounds worth it!

Write nsSearchService cache with OS.File, v2

Same one, with tests.
Hrm, was this forgotten, or is there something else preventing it from landing?

Write nsSearchService cache with OS.File, v2.1

Indeed, it was forgotten (and slightly bitrotten).

I will wait for Telemetry to tell us whether encoding on the main thread is a good idea, though. I am starting to believe that we should wait for something like bug 832664 before proceeding with such transformations.

This isn't adding any additional main thread work, right? As far as I can tell this is a net reduction in the amount of main-thread work going on, so I don't see why we would block on additional improvements.
Ah, you are right. I was assuming that the pre-existing code managed to make more things asynchronous. So the patch is a net improvement â€“ one which we may want to improve further.

Fixed test.
Try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=8cb97f8a9fde
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/910837eec45a
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/910837eec45a
Hmm, this test fails intermittently when we run it on our own builds in Ubuntu:

https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/job/raring-ppa-adt-ubuntu_mozilla_daily_ppa-firefox-trunk/92/ARCH=amd64,label=adt/testReport/junit/toolkit.components.search.tests/xpcshell/test_nocache_js/

It looks like adding the search engine completes before the initial cache file is written
I'll take a look asap.
Chris, I can't read that log. Do you still have it accessible somewhere?
Ah, sorry, I didn't realize that Jenkins doesn't keep very much history, otherwise I would have just pasted the failure inline (and we filter this test out now so that the failure doesn't show up in the UI).

I've just had a look through some recent logs though and found this, which I think is the same failure:
