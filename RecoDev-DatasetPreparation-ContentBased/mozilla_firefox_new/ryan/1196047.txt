After the large move in bug 912121, there will be a few things in /devtools/shared that need more specific tweaks:

* /devtools/shared/shared: Most of these are server files, move them there
* Other bits may be server specific as well

I wonder if it'd be useful to nest all of these in devtools/shared/worker/*? Also, we should be able to do `devtools/shared/worker` and `devtools/shared/worker/other-worker-module` by using standard node resolution rules, if that helps at all

Don't think this is needed. I see skip-if = toolkit == 'android' || toolkit == 'gonk' at the top of the xpcshell.ini file here

Lots of notes -- I don't think this'll work when debugging Gecko < 43 for the reasons below. If you have any questions or want me to do any moving, let me know! These modules are a mess.

::: devtools/server/performance/moz.build:8
(Diff revision 1)
> +    'legacy',

Legacy is exclusively on the client. We should move this entire directory to devtools/client/performance/legacy I think.

::: devtools/server/performance/moz.build:14
(Diff revision 1)
> +    'recording-common.js',

recording-common is used to decorate both Actor and Front for PerformanceRecording, as well as legacy Recordings -- so this should probably be shared then, yeah?

::: devtools/shared/performance/moz.build
(Diff revision 1)
> -  'io.js',

io.js manages the importing/exporting of profile recordings -- meaning this should never be on the server as it is accessing the file system. Both legacy and performance actor style use this on the client. I don't believe there are any uses that are not on the client.

::: devtools/shared/performance/moz.build:11
(Diff revision 1)
> -  'utils.js',
> +    'utils.js',

I *think* utils is only on the client, it mostly (entirely?) massages recording data (inflates profile, normalizes timing, etc). This could also live on the client (and renamed to recording-data.js)

Okay, removed.
https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/21519/#review19393

If you mean `devtools/shared/worker` would resolve to `devtools/shared/worker/index.js`, it looks like that requires setting `isNative: true` on the loader, which DevTools Loader.jsm does not do currently.  Filed bug 1213028 to explore it.

Thanks for catching that!

> Are the skip-if's meant to be removed here?

Yes, I removed them because they should be redundant: files in /devtools/client aren't shipped to those platforms, so these tests should never be run there either.  I'll put it back if try gets mad.
https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/21519/#review19393

Okay, I've moved them all under `devtools/shared/worker/*`.
https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/21521/#review19395

As discussed on IRC, it should be fine for <43 since the client app (desktop Firefox) has to ship all 3 DevTools directories, mainly because fronts are usually in `server` with their actors.

> Legacy is exclusively on the client. We should move this entire directory to devtools/client/performance/legacy I think.

Okay, I see what you mean.  It's lazily referenced from the actor file in `server`, but only ever actually loaded by the client app, so I'll move it to `client`.

> recording-common is used to decorate both Actor and Front for PerformanceRecording, as well as legacy Recordings -- so this should probably be shared then, yeah?

Now that legacy is in `client`, yes, it's split across.  I'll move it back to shared.

> io.js manages the importing/exporting of profile recordings -- meaning this should never be on the server as it is accessing the file system. Both legacy and performance actor style use this on the client. I don't believe there are any uses that are not on the client.

You're right, it's lazily referenced from actor files, but only used in fronts.  I'll move to `client`.

> I *think* utils is only on the client, it mostly (entirely?) massages recording data (inflates profile, normalizes timing, etc). This could also live on the client (and renamed to recording-data.js)

It's actually used on both client and server, as in[1].  I'll leave it in `shared`, but I'll rename to `recording-utils.js`, since you usually import it as `RecordingUtils`.

I think there's something up with the legacy actor tests (browser_perf-legacy-front-0*.js, 01, 02, 03), they are renamed to 07, 08, 09, removed from browser.ini, and looks like some other changes in the tests itself that will cause them to fail. R+ with those tests moved back to 01, 02, 03, and readded in browser.ini (and ensure the removal of other requires in those tests are intentional)

Ugh, wrong bug number.  Meant for bug 1212653.

https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/21521/#review19449

We discussed on IRC that I had moved the tests to client, and there were existing tests with the same name, so I re-numbered them.

The test changes are because of different head files between the test directories.
