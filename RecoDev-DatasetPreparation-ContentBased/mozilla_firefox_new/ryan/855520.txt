I think that's pretty ugly.

Debugger (and upcoming network monitor) sidebars use am inherited (-moz-box?) font family and size with 4px margins and GrayText.

This gives the "No element selected" message the same padding as the rules that appear when something is selected.

You should also use a
>  font: message-box;
and
>  color: GrayText;
for the #noResults element specifically, since that's the style used by every other pane across the developer tools for signaling that "There's nothing here yet".
