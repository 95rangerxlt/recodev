Agreed.  Plus we should set the 'Show Browser Styles' pref on by default in the browser toolbox for the same reason.
I'm not sure exactly how this will be implemented, since the options panel / tools are just reading prefs.  Ryan, is there a way to detect that we are in the Browser Toolbox on startup and then maybe we could set a couple of prefs immediately?

Set chrome prefs in Browser Toolbox

We can just force them on at startup for the Browser Toolbox.

Works for me.  Can't remember if there is test coverage for this window, but may add a check there if so.

I don't believe there is, unfortunately.
