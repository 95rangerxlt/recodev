This makes the variables view navigation more like the markup view:

* Left arrow now treats collapse and navigate as separate steps

Also, I tentatively removed the special casing of variables and properties vs. scopes from left arrow and down arrow.  I did not follow the justification for this distinction here.  During my testing of the change above, I found it unintuitive to have down arrow expand a scope instead of moving to the next scope, as it does with variables and properties

I love this, the code is much simpler :)
You'll need to fix and add some testing for this. Currently browser_dbg_propertyview-data.js fails, so giving f+ for now.

Patch v2

I've fixed up the existing tests and added a few more for the new behavior.  All tests in the debugger directory are now passing.

Also, I tweaked the right arrow so that it does not advance / move focus if you are on a non-expandable item.  This makes it behave the same as the markup view.

This behavior shouldn't be tested, it can change anytime (it's actually a bug). Use UP instead.
