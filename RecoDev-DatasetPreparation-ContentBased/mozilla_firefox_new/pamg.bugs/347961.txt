Hmm, I'm not seeing any special "glow" with a windows branch build, either (testcase is http://technorati.com/).
Joe was handling all the glow detection work but I believe he's on vacation now. Pam - any chance you can take a look?
Joe did the winstripe glow work.  It looks like his patch https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=232037&action=view for bug 345466 was never merged into the other searchbar.css changes.  I don't think he looked at pinstripe at all.

I'll take a look at both themes' detection and display of autodetected engines after I finish with bug 347400, if nobody else has gotten to them first.
Working on this now.  I'll roll the changes into the upcoming patch for bug 347400, since they affect many of the same CSS files.
A patch has been submitted for bug 347400 that includes fixes for this problem too.
