The GCLI helper buttons (Tilt cube, Scratchpad and Responsive View) should not be visible when the Developer Tools are launched in Remote mode. They don't work.

One possibility would be to put them in the global toolbar next to the command line.

Good spot.

We'd like to move the command line into the developer tools window, so they could work (this would require a remote-able gcli, or one that was hidden if the target was remote)

I think that in the short term we should remove the buttons if the target is remote.
that wfm.
