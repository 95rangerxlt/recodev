Thanks! I've been meaning to ask for better output for console.error() when errors are given. r+ with one minor change below.

aThing.message is sometimes undefined, eg. for XPCOM-related exceptions. I learned this the hard way with a cryptic "undefined" error coming from the debugger client. I had to do dump("error " + ex + "\n") to see the actual error.

Can you change this to reply += " Message: " + aThing + "\n" ?
Mihai: are you waiting for me to land this before your patch lands, would you like to incorporate this in your patch, or shall I rebase this on your patch? Happy any way.
(going through bugmail!)

Go ahead and land this patch. Do not wait for my patch. I am happy to rebase my patches on top of this one.

Thanks!
