Bug 975522 introduced new functionality which is called CSS Coverage. In csscoverage.properties you can find two l10n keys:

csscoverageStopDesc=Stop collecting CSS coverage analysis
csscoverageOneShotDesc=Stop collecting CSS coverage analysis

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/429f55154e83/toolkit/locales/en-US/chrome/global/devtools/csscoverage.properties

I think second ("csscoverageOneShotDesc") description is wrong because "oneshot" parameter does start and stop.

"One other command ("csscoverage oneshot") allows you to effectively run ("csscoverage start; csscoverage stop")."

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/CSS_Coverage

For me it is one page load analyze and not just "stop". Copy & paste error?
