Currently when you remote commands from one system to another, selection types have their options copied at connection time. They should be dynamic.

For example:

  :global nestediframe.html

(:global is like 'cd' in firebug, (we're intending to have an alias))

This would work so long as the iframe was present when the connection was made, but really we should be doing the lookup as the user types 'global'.

When we have done this, command serialization, which calls type.getBlank() shouldn't need a context any more.
