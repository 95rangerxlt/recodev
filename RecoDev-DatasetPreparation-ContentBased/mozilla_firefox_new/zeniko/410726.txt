Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy this bug's URL to the address bar and hit Enter.

Expected Results:
An alert reading "stab".

Actual result:
An alert reading "s	ab" (the newline separated \ from t - now they're interpreted as a <tab>).

Depending on how bug 397815 gets fixed, this issue might get fixed as well.

So bug 397815 didn't fix this completely...

New Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy&paste the following into the address bar and hit Enter/Go:
> data:text/plain,Percent:%20%25%0ANewline
2. Hit Enter again

Expected Result:
Nothing happens (two lines are displayed after both steps 1 and 2).

Actual Result:
After step 2, the newline vanishes.

I guess that's because the urlbar is set to newlines="stripsurroundingwhitespace" but whitespace isn't properly escaped at

>-        value = decodeURI(value).replace(/%/g, "%25");

would fix this issue for me.

I think this makes sense. Would you like to take the bug?
Oops.

keep non-space whitespace encoded

See comment #4 for why we need to keep newlines and tabs encoded as well.

Why not just use \s?
(In reply to comment #7)
Because we explicitly don't want to have %20 for plain spaces. At least that's how I understand the intention of these decoding bits.
