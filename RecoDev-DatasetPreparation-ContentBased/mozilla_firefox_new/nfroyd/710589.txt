The Telemetry notification still displays the close (x) button when selecting Learn more (which redirects to Privacy Policy) after receiving the two-state notification.
Bug 697860 states that the close button shouldn't be displayed anymore for the Telemetry Notification.

STR:

1. Start Firefox with a clean profile
2. Restart Firefox to dismiss the "Know your rights" notification and receive the two state Telemetry notification
3. Select Learn more. (This will redirect to the Privacy Policy)

The Telemetry close button is still displayed here. The button should be hidden as specified in bug 697860.

Probably not terrible to display the close button here as long as clicking close != a click on No for Telemetry.

this should fix it
Vladan, can you wrap this up?
This will make bug 725407 somewhat less ugly too.

Revised patch.  I gave the function a number of parameters so that it's useful for bug 725407.

be consistent w/ prefixing parameters with "a" and camel-casing (eg, compare aNotifyBox with hideclose). look elsewhere in file for what styles to follow here.

Made style consistent by using non-a-prefixed things and broke lines as best I could.  Carrying over r+.
