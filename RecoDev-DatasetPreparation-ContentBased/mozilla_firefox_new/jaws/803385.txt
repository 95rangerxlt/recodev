Patch

At http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cf1bbed46731/toolkit/components/social/WorkerAPI.jsm#l72 we should only dereference the |value| variable if it is not undefined.

Using destructuring assignment, if the string doesn't contain an "=" character, then the |value| variable will have undefined.

This bug was fixed by the patch for bug 787767 on mozilla-central(19), so this patch is only designed for uplift to mozilla-aurora(18) and mozilla-beta(17).

On requesting uplift:
This is a minor code change that will only affect the Social API. This has been tested locally and is under test on mozilla-central. There are no expected regressions with this change and there are no string changes either.

Should this have a test?
Tagging [qa-] as it appears the change here is low risk and doesn't need QA verification. Jared, please remove [qa-] and add the verifyme keyword if there's something you want tested here.
