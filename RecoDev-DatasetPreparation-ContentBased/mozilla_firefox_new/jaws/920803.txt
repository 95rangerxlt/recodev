Firefox 24.0 on Mac OS X (CC-ed person Sören should know the version)

The button texts for the click-to-activate UI doesn't fit, the buttons don't adapt. On Windows XP, the spacing between text and button border is smaller than on the left, but doesn't overflow like on Mac OS X.

Firefox 24.0 on Mac OS X (CC-ed person Sören should know the version)

The width of the entire doorhanger is currently limited to 28em in CSS: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/plugin-doorhanger.inc.css#5

This is because without a specified width, the main content of the doorhanger won't wrap and it becomes arbitrarily wide. Axel or Jaws, what's the correct way to deal with this so that the buttons fit but we still limit the total width to something reasonable?
We can allow the localizer to specify the width in this case.
I'll take this.

Patch

I used 336 because it was the box object width in pixels when the width of the doorhanger was set to 28em.

I think we should be able to uplift this to Aurora because it is not a "user-facing" string, but I'm not sure what the technicalities around this are.

This patch will allow a localizer to increase (they shouldn't need to decrease) the width of the doorhanger to fit the locale's requirements.
Please add a localization comment explaining what that value is used for and how to verify it.

Technically is a string, so it will break string freeze, be reported if missing and fall back to English (which is OK in this case). 

We should try to understand how many locales are affected to get a better idea of the situation (this is in release for Germany, right?).

Patch

We should continue to use em, not pixel values. See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=em%22&find=locales&filter=width for some precedent.
Also, "clickToPlayNotification" is (1) too unspecific (e.g. it doesn't mention plugins) and (2) not used in any other entity. Is there no common prefix for the strings used in this popup?

Yes, I have been told the screenshot is for Firefox 24.

Even with the entity to control the doorhanger width, this would have been missed because of the platform dependent styling.

Should we do a separate Mac, Windows, and Linux platform width? It's possible, but is also likely overkill. I don't think our platform dependent styling here is that different between the three environments.

Patch v1.1
There is no need for separate widths. I will likely increase the width necessary on Windows by 10%. (Manual or automated testing if the button texts overflow would be better.)

I did a quick check and I think more locales are affected. I'm pretty sure about bg and el, but others have long strings for those buttons, so it would be good to land it on Aurora (as I said, having en-US fallback in this case is good, talked with Pike on IRC and he agrees).

Should also note that this needs to be a CSS length value.

Patch for Aurora

<jaws> maybe 1 beta is enough for the few locales that this is affecting (with special outreach to them?)
<flod> I don't think we have time to get into beta4 (next monday), then there's the summit (no beta in the middle of the week)
<flod> but l10n-freeze is on Oct 21st, so we should have time to test it and update locales
<flod> Pike: thoughts? ^^
<•Pike> I'd take it
<flod> jaws: ^^ (I agree)
<jaws> cool, now to push on the review and get it uplifted quickly

I just committed a second increase of the doorhanger width to German aurora and beta, the first increase wasn't sufficient.

Errr, did you mean to remove the undoCloseTabs.label in the same commit, without mentioning it in the commit message?

Yes, I likely forgot to remove that obsolete string earlier and the l10n dashboard only shows missing strings on its landing page, so I saw that by surprise and thought "Let's also fix that".
Tracy, I can confirm this is not reproducing on FF 25b9 using Windows 7x32 and Mac OS 10.8.4 but the problem is that I am not able to reproduce the initial issue on Nightly (2013-09-25) because there is no german nightly build (2013-09-25) on FTP or l10n.
Marking this [qa-] based on comment 22. Please reopen if you can still reproduce this bug in the latest Nightly.
