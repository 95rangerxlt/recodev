It could be better to have two different icons : one to display in full-screen the other in normal mode. The main difference would be the arrows direction.

So our theme code for the panel menu only checks for the presence of the 'checked' attribute. However, this is consistent with how much of our theme code works elsewhere in the front-end.

In the case of entering, then exiting, the checked attribute gained the 'false' value, so the attribute was still present and hence the button still showed the checked state.

We could probably get this fixed on mozilla-central now, since it doesn't depend on the customizable UI parts.
