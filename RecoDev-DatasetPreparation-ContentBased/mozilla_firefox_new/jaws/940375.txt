To make separate installs easier, and to reduce confusion between Nightly (mozilla-central) and Holly (projects/holly), we are going to change the branding of Holly to use "Holly" instead of "Nightly".

Before Holly is merged to mozilla-aurora, the changeset here will need to be backed out.

"Holly" is a bit obscure, but I don't have a better suggestion ("NightlyClassic!").
Stuck with Holly, this is temporary and other names like "NightlyClassic" may confuse people who start associating the name with Windows Classic, etc.
