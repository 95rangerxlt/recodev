Looks like the issue with Recently Closed tabs has returned.

STR:
Click App-button
Click Recent Closed tabs
Try to open any tab in the closed tab list - using middle-click
NOTE: that the Top tab in the 'recent closed' list is the only one that will open.


Seems to fail if link is opened with middle-click - normal click on recent closed will open the tab...
Also happens in a new profile - no addons

cset af4e3ce8c487 ok
cset 0d0263a58f06 bad

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/p ... 0263a58f06 regression range <- 223 cset's

need help finding the m-i regressor

Forgot to add that left-clicking opens the link in a 'New Tab' unlike the old way of opening it on the 'active' tab, that's why using middle-click is desired if you want to reopen it in a new tab rather than the currently displayed 'active' tab.
while the code lives in the history menu, it's not related to Bookmarks & History functionality, moving to menus.
This may have possibly came as a result in the change of behavior with undoCloseTab.

Patch

HistoryMenu._undoCloseMiddleClick called undoCloseTab with the index as a String, and undoCloseTab was only accepting Number arguments. It's more important to fix undoCloseTab since there may be other callers that are passing a string as the argument.
If you're getting rid of the restriction that it has to be passed a number, shouldn't you remove the isInteger check entirely and just always coerce? Or does it still need to distinguish undefined, in which case an explicit check would probably be better...

Patch v2 (aurora)

Good point. The previous patch actually had a bug with this in that it entered the code path for restoring multiple tabs. This is now fixed.

Your patch works, but I took this opportunity to clean up a bit:
- use explicit vs. implicit conversion (Number() vs. +)
- adjust the bounds checking code to be more readable, the old code was hard to follow
For aurora uplift, I'm fine just taking your patch FWIW.

Please move the declaration of |tab| to before the while loop since it is now not referenced until later.

This doesn't handle aIndex being 0, as far as I can see. numberOfTabsToUndoClose should be 0 in that case.

This has the same problem.

Err, numberOfTabsToUndoClose needs to be 1 of course.
I would recommend:

  if (isNaN(index)) {
    index = 0;
    numberOfTabsToUndoClose = ss.getNumberOfTabsClosedLast(window);
  } else {
    if (index < 0 || index >= ss.getClosedTabCount(window))
      return null;
    numberOfTabsToUndoClose = 1;
  }
Thanks, good catch. Somewhat embarassing!

I went with your suggestion:
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/636e3b9d1f72

We should have a test for this...

So....what needs uplifting here? The Aurora patch with a+ and r- or the patch that managed to land but doesn't have approval?

A new patch will need to be written and I'll re-request aurora approval. The patch that made it to m-c is good.
