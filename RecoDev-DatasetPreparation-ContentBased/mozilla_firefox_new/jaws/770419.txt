I talked with shorlander and we think that we should keep the context menuitems for sending media but rename them to be simpler and more obvious as to their outcomes.

In the case of these items, the user doesn't get to choose *how* the message is sent, so the word "As" in "Send Image As..." doesn't really apply here.

We can make this more intuitive by changing these to:
"Email Image...", "Email Video...", and "Email Audio..."

The behavior of these menuitems will remain the same.

Patch

This patch is dependent on the patch for bug 239307, that's why I didn't update the sendPageCmd in browser-context.inc since the send page command is removed from the context menu in the patch for bug 239307.

This patch renames Send Image, Send Video, Send Audio, and Send Page to Email *.

This MXR search shows that these are the only "Send *" strings that will lead to a user sending an email <https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=send+&find=\.dtd&findi=\.x.l&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central>.

This bug has a more complete summary, please use that (at least).

>-<!ENTITY sendPageCmd.label            "Send Linkâ¦">
>-<!ENTITY sendPageCmd.accesskey        "e">
>+<!ENTITY sendPageCmd2.label           "Email Linkâ¦">
>+<!ENTITY sendPageCmd2.accesskey       "E">

emailFooCmd rather than sendFooCmd2.

The original spelling of the verb is "e-mail". Not sure which is better or used more commonly...

"email" is used more commonly (see Google results, etc.) and is also what we use (including in 'Copy Email Address'):
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=email&find=\.dtd%24&findi=\.dtd%24&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
although pippki is the odd exception:

Patch v2

I renamed the entities to be email*Cmd, but I didn't update the commands or other related items because I don't think the tradeoff of hg history churn is worth it.

test_contextmenu.html passes green locally.

On the question of email vs e-mail, the brand toolkit [0] says to refer to the AP Styleguide [1] which recommends 'email'.

Do we want a followup bug to consider entirely removing these?

I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards not removing these (hence the filing of this bug).

Our current data shows that ~3% of context menu clicks are for send-image. As mentioned in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252277#c10, the URLs for these items are generally hidden vs. the generally visibile page URLs. This distinction makes the benefit of keeping these menuitems greater than the 'Send Page...' one.


Rename "Send Image...", "Send Video...", and "Send Audio..." to "Email Image...", etc
