This is probably hitting our startup costs pretty heavily, and we are only loading CustomizeMode.jsm because of the tabs progress listener, for which one already exists in browser.js. Piggy-backing on that tabs progress listener can still get us the same functionality without loading the new JSM.

I've confirmed using the Browser Debugger that CustomizeMode.jsm is not loaded anymore upon startup, while typing about:customizing in the location bar and hitting Enter still works.

Nit: remove the third argument while you're touching this.

What is aDocument good for here? browser-customization.js belongs to a browser window. 'document' is accessible here and already used elsewhere in this file.

Prevailing browser.js style is to use caps or to just write it like a normal variable in case it's not a global.

Also, "about URI" seems unclear and could clash with other random code in this method. "customizing URI" would be clearer.

>+      if (aBrowser.currentURI.spec == kAboutURI &&

As opposed to XULBrowserWindow.onLocationChange, this code handles background tabs. This means it will call gCustomizeMode.enter when about:customizing is loaded in a background tab and gCustomizeMode.exit when something else is loaded in a background tab while customizing. This doesn't seem to make sense.

This method seems unused?

Thanks for the drive-by review. Does this look better to you?

This looks better, but at this point it seems that you should remove CustomizeMode.jsm's code dealing with the TabSelect event -- XULBrowserWindow.onLocationChange takes care of this.

This is great, as it now allows us to remove gCustomizeMode.uninit(), which would load CustomizeMode.jsm upon shutdown even if Customize Mode was never entered.

you can use 'location' instead of browser.currentURI.spec
Cool, I've made that change and repushed to try on an older revision since the UX tree is currently burning on linux:

For reasons completely beyond me this doesn't seem to buy us anything for Linux tspaint. Which doesn't mean this isn't a good idea, but that's still weird... :-\

This turned mochitest-browser/chrome orange on all platforms:

01:52:38 WARNING - TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug422590.js | Test timed out

:-(
Backed out in https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/30b4e0a35ef8
Now that the dep that caused the orange is fixed, this can probably safely reland, but if you want to be safe you may want to do a try run beforehand.
I'm pretty confident that the try run won't be necessary.

Relanded, https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/c901ba98ea87
This has landed, so marking as fixed to fix bug queries. :-)
