These are showing up in tests and sometimes in normal use as well. I think it's caused by us trying to access the docshell too shortly after document insertion of the iframe.

This sets isAppTab to true when the panel is opened.

I tried adding a separate "load" event listener within updateButton but I still got iframe.docShell undefined errors (not sure why though). This patch works though without generating the errors.

Patch (part 2)

This patch renames the variables from notifBrowser to notificationFrame (and related changes). Just some cleanup that Gavin did while looking at this bug.

if notifBrowser.contentDocument exists, notifBrowser.docShell should exist as well. So you could set it unconditionally outside the if. But perhaps you have tried it and it didn't work?

Thanks, I just didn't think of that. I tested it and it works fine.
