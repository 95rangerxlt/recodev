You may be running into bug 383348? We have build dependencies that don't cause the build to fail, but instead result in run-time errors.
Fixing bug 823994 didn't resolve this.  Do these need to be built on Ubuntu boxes?  Is there anyway that using a regular CI build (non nightly, non pgo) from inbound could still fail?
gavin, do you have any ideas why I would still be experiencing these problems after installing the proper libraries on the build machines?
Yeah, I started looking into this a bit yesterday. Now that I actually look at the errors from comment 0 in more detail, it seems like something weirder is going on. In particular:

Got file:///home/cltbld/Nightly_wallpaper.png, expected /home/cltbld/Nightly_wallpaper.png

The test is checking the GConf /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename key, to see whether it matches the value that the shell service should be setting here: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b5a78c274c09/browser/components/shell/src/nsGNOMEShellService.cpp#l476.

Is is possible that GConf is re-writing the value being set into a URI rather than a filename, but only on some systems? I don't know this code very well, CCing some people who might.
thanks Gavin.
The problem is that on Ubuntu 12.04, the shell service will set the wallpaper via GSettings rather than GConf, so I would expect these tests to always fail there.

We've just started running these tests on our builds too and hit the exact same issue, so we disabled this specific one for now (and browser/components/shell/test/unit/test_421977.js)

I need to update them so that they aren't GConf specific really
Is there a bug to track disabling these two tests?  I don't see it on inbound, I assume it will be sometime soon on inbound/central.
There isn't a bug yet. Shall we use this one?

Skip GConf-specific shell component tests on systems with GSettings

This is what we're using in Ubuntu to disable these 2 tests
Comment on attachment 702604
Skip GConf-specific shell component tests on systems with GSettings

We should just land this and get a bug on file to improve the tests.
Thanks Chris!

nsIGConfService seems to not work as expected on ubuntu 12.04
