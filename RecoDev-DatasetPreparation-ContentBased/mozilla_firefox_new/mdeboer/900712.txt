If you add the engine from:

http://suche.web.de/

And set it as the search engine in the URL bar, and then do a search with German characters, the search is corrupted.

Issue with the patch in bug 890690 - it doesn't do the encoding junk that getSubmission does (and can't, because an engine's charset isn't exposed to external consumers). The way to fix this is probably to fix the followup I mentioned in bug 890690 comment 14 (that I don't think was ever filed?).
This was fixed by bug 900865.


about:home doesn't handle ISO-8859-1 search engines properly
