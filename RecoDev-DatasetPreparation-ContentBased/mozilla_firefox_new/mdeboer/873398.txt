The new PanelUI doesn't discern between disabled and enabled items. Copy/ Paste buttons and disabled menu items in subviews look enabled except for not having hover and down states.

Expected behavior:
The buttons should look 'disabled' when they in fact are.

On Windows the buttons switch to using color:graytext, but we could also do better by setting the icon opacity to 0.5.

The above selector will be better, but I'm not sure if it will apply to the toolbaritems for the edit controls and zoom controls.

A better approach would be to set a class on all first-level children of the #PanelUI-contents. When we enter customization mode, make sure that the class is still applied to what used to be the first-level children (it can be copied to the toolbarpaletteitem, but not moved).

Doing so would allow the selector to simply be written as:

> .panel-contents-button[disabled] > .toolbarbutton-icon,
> .panel-combined-button[disabled] > .toolbarbutton-icon {
>   ...
> }

We're not actually setting a class of 'panel-contents-button' yet. That will have to be added to this patch.
