As mentioned in bug 868433, renaming the 'name' property of a widget to 'label' was discussed, to mirror the button node property names.

In that bug we already renamed the 'description' property to 'tooltiptext' with the same reason.

Calling this P5 since there's no user impact, but if we're going to do this we should do it ASAP to minimize API churn.

v1: Rename 'name' and 'description' properties to 'label' and 'tooltiptext' respectively
