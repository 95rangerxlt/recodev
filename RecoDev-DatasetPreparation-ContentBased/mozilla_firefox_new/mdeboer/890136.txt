When I press down on the History button in the Australis Menu, it turns into some weird yellow thing.
WFM, I don't see anything strange. Screenshot? Addons?
This is with a clean profile.

MattN suspects this only happens on normal-DPI displays.

I see this too, I think my bug is a dupe of this 890894.

100% reproducable on normal-dpi (I used layout.css.devPixelsPerPx = 1.0 for that).

Patch: buttons in the menupanel don't have a separate down state

You're ruining the nice short rules :P  I'm tempted to suggest using a preprocessor define which includes the pseudoclasses and the :not() that you're adding but I don't know that we've done that before and I'm not sure of a good name for it. e.g.

#bookmarks-menu-button@buttonRuleSuffix@ {
  …
}

Dão, any thoughts on the duplication of the rule suffix? Shall we just go with the copy-paste solution of this patch?

I assume you're not touching the ones that will be combined into the addressbar item (bug 755598) because they're going to change or be removed.

Something is still wrong with the checked state of the fullscreen button as it shows with no icon. If it requires a different fix then we can handle it in a separate bug if you want.

Patch: buttons in the menupanel don't have a separate down state

Adding a define such as @toolbarButtonPressed@ sounds ok to me.

Patch v2: buttons in the menupanel don't have a separate down state

Defined 'toolbarButtonPressed' to shorten selectors, fixed checked fullscreen button.

Matt: I indeed did not touch the buttons to be removed in bug 755598.
