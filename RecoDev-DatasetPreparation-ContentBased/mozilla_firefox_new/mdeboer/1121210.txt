The default behavior when Online tab is activated
Note that this can only happen if the user signed in with FxA otherwise the contact tab doesn't show.
[:MattN], yes, you're right, I forgot to mention that I'm using the FxA.

*** Bug 1121401 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Marking this as a P2 for Hello 36 tours. Although it will not impede development, we're at risk for a much larger audience being exposed to this UX.

If the larger platform fix can't be implemented, let's see if we can execute a smaller scale fix, e.g. notifying web that the tab has changed.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention! It is very much appreciated.
Matt: I think you said you had an idea for how to workaround this specific case without the general fix in bug 1109868? What was it? Something about adding a hack to hire/reposition the infopanel when the contacts tab was clicked?

I think we also talked about me being confused what's triggering this bug -- I thought panels got positioned when first shown, and stayed put... What's causing it to reposition when Contacts is clicked?

Also, I noticed the panel will go back to the correct position when clicking the Conversations tab again, so I think that makes this less important to fix.
I'll implement a workaround with possibility to provide a secondary anchor, which will be used when the original anchor is hidden.
So in this case that would be the conversations tab button.
Or not. After some investigation, this bug is really caused by the panel implementation and bug 1109868 would fix this properly.

I'll attach a patch that introduces the 'Loop:SelectedTabChanged' UITour notification, which the content page should act upon.

This approach may work but sometimes the panel gets in a broken state before the page has time to react. Alex is able to get the panel in a broken state but I'm not on my machine. Alex should try a try-build to confirm that this approach works.

s/Selected/Panel/

SelectedTab is too easy to confuse with tabbrowser tabs IMO and makes it more clear this is related to the panel instead of some other Loop UI.

Yeah, either the approach that Mike has where we tell the page and it hides the highlight or we just listen for the tab change ourselves in UITour and hide.

It's layout/XUL code that makes the panel follow the anchor e.g. when you move the wrowser window.

Yeah, that can happen in some cases as long as the element is identical and hasn't been re-created to simply look the same.

You should pass along the selectedTab name with notifyUITour so the page can handle switching back to the room tab if it wants.

I think the approach is good but I think there should be a test and the helpers should move to LoopUI (or somewhere else in Loop code).

Please make these underscore prefixed helper method on the UITour object to align with the others. I also try to keep as much non-tour code out of UITour.jsm so I would prefer if these were actually helpers in Loop code instead e.g. LoopUI. The advantage is that the code stays closer to the implementation so it's less likely to get overlooked in a refactoring. With that in mind, I also think a test for dealing with tabs would be good as I can see that breaking because it relies even more on the document structure.

aDocument.contentWindow? I think you want document.defaultView.LoopUI and I don't think aDocument.contentWindow exists.

Corey, the UITour content will now receive a notification when the Loop panel tab changes: 'Loop:PanelTabChanged', with one param: {String} roomName. The values for `roomName` at this time may be 'rooms' or 'contacts'.
When the 'rooms' tab is not selected to begin with when contents calls to show the info panels, they will be ignored and the panels won't be shown.

I recommend to implement the following in the UITour content page: observe the 'Loop:PanelTabChanged' notification and hide the info panel for the 'Start Conversation' button and the room list when it switches to any tab other than 'rooms'.
Sorry, it's Cory!

While this event is working ok, as we discussed prior to implementing this solution - sometimes there is a delay between the tabs switching, and the web page being notified in time.

On my machine, this can result in info-panels becoming incorrectly sized when not hidden in time (see attachment). This effects info panel sizing until the next time I restart Firefox.
Yeah, we knew this was likely to happen but it only affects certain configurations and it was the most straightforward solution. We'll see how many people complain.

I see some activity on this bug, just want to add a quick note that the event is not quite working as described here.

See manual[0]. There's no 'roomName' param.

> 'Loop:PanelTabChanged' - User clicks on the Contacts or Room tab in the panel.

Noting because the tours are expecting the current behavior, so please don't change back :)

This is a new notification with the name 'Loop:PanelTabChanged' and the parameter passed in is a String, not an Object. The value of this string is the actual tab name.
