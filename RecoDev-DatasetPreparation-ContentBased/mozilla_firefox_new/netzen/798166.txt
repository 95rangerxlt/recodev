After clicking set default browser in preferences < win8, it will sometimes not update the UI to indicate you have the default browser.

This change:
-    document.getElementById("setDefaultPane").selectedIndex = 1;
+    let selectedIndex =
+      shellSvc.isDefaultBrowser(false, true) ? 1 : 0;
+    document.getElementById("setDefaultPane").selectedIndex = selectedIndex;

Caused an intermittent display problem on Windows when setting the default browser.
The real problem is inside windows shell code, where we return success before the launched helper.exe finishes.
But I don't think introducing a wait for helper.exe process is a good thing to do.

The best way to fix this is to just enable the timer always, not just on Windows 8.
The user can go into control panel while the window is open anyway and set defaults that way.

nit discussed on irc: we'll remove this condition and always set up the timer because the user might change this through another channel while the pref window is open

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): bug 791019
User impact if declined: In preferences, after clicking set default browser on Win7 and below, it will intermittently lead to the button not showing that you are the default.  The user would think they didn't set the default, but it would actually be set.  It is more of a polish regression.  It looks bad that the UI doesn't react as the user expects.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): I tested on m-c in Win7 and Win8 and it was working correctly.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Very low 
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None
