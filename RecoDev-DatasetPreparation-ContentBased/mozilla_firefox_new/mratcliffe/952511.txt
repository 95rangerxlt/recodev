Open the markup view, inspect the body element, then from the console, do:

document.body.setAttribute("style", "background-color:#FF0F0F")

The attribute won't be hexa.

Let's just **never** use the output parser in the markup view.

Why is it useful in the markup view?

For making urls clickable e.g. url(http://www.google.com). We should leave colors alone though or always convert them, I will take a look.

I have removed the output parser from the markup view as it really shouldn't be used there. We really want the markup view to be as close to the real HTML as possible.

The patch is very simple:
- Remove output parser from markup-view.js
- Remove pref change listener and handler as we no longer need to listen for changed color types.
- Change from creating the attribute with outputParser.parseHTMLAttribute() to using a simple string.
- Delete _truncateFrag() as we are now simply truncating a string.
- Fixed devtools/markupview/test/browser_inspector_markup_edit.js as the truncated output is now different.

Simple enough change for a R+ without any comments.
Especially when code is being removed!
