There's probably a more descriptive change to the key, I suggest to think about them as variable names. How about jsbSelectBraceStyleDesc?

I'd recommend to get a copy writer for this like Matej.

My non-native speaker suggestion would be to use ';' to separate the cases consistently (no or for the last one).

This idea here is that this is the 'desc'ription of the 'braceStyle' parameter to the 'jsb' command. All GCLI parameter strings follow this basic pattern (<command><parameter><use>), and we add numbers to the end to avoid breaking the pattern needlessly.

I think we need to get bug 799462 landed, so we can get it in aurora fairly soon, so we don't confuse any more translators.
This means that this bug will be bitrotted. r+ nevertheless.
New component triage. Filter on "Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce"

I think I need a little explanation here

jsbBraceStyleManual2=Select the coding style of braces: collapse - put braces on the same line as control statements; expand - put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style); end-expand - put end braces on own line; expand-strict - put braces on own line even if it will break your code.

1) My understanding is that collapse, end-expand, etc. should not be translated, since they're parameter values. Am I right? In this case a localization comment should be added to explain it.

2) "even if it will break your code". Breaking the code means that the code is no more functional or something else?

This bug is already landed so I have logged bug 845750 to address your comments.


GCLI jsb command should have nice html-free updates to jsbBraceStyleDesc and jsbBraceStyleManual strings
