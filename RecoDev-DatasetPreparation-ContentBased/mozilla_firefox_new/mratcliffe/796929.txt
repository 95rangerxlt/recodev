I frequently jump to the command line in the toolbar and find that it does not accept any commands from me.

I don't have any reliable steps to reproduce this, but I can say that it happens to me frequently. I do not restart my Firefox very often (though I run Nightly, so it will tend to get a daily restart because of that). It seems to consistently work after a restart, but sometime later stops.

This error appears in the Error Console:

this._panel.hidePopup is not a function
DeveloperToolbar.jsm line 769

Simple fix

Occasionally, when the planets are all aligned correctly, panels lack some panel methods because they are half destroyed.
This patch uses the following to work around the problem:
  if (this._panel && this._panel.hidePopup) {
    this._panel.hidePopup();
  }
