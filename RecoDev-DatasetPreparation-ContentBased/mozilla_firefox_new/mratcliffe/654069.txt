In view of bug 591582 CSS Properties are now distributed as follows:
Text, Fonts & Color: 73
Lists: 9
Background: 12
Dimensions: 31
Positioning & Page Flow: 72
Borders: 68
Effects & Other: 123

"Effects and Other" should probably have at least one more category extracted. The most obvious is "Transforms."
