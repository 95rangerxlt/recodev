To avoid issues with people using older versions of node we should have a ruleset to avoid things that have recently been added to JavaScript.

These rules should work:
{
  // Extend from the shared list of defined globals for mochitests.
  "extends": "../../../../devtools/.eslintrc",

  "ecmaFeatures": {
    "arrowFunctions": false,
    "blockBindings": false,
    "destructuring": false,
    "regexYFlag": false,
    "regexUFlag": false,
    "templateStrings": false,
    "binaryLiterals": false,
    "octalLiterals": false,
    "unicodeCodePointEscapes": false,
    "defaultParams": false,
    "restParams": false,

    "spread": false,

As discussed: I just don't think we should use this .eslintrc config file as a documentation for the rules. We already have docs in another directory.

As someone not used to nodejs that much, I had no idea these were the nodejs globals. So at least add a comment about this.
__But__ eslint also has a way to enable the nodejs environment, without you having to list all of these:
```
{
    "env": {
        "node": true
    }
}
```

I think by default, eslint considers the code to be es5, so I don't see a need for specifically disabling these language features:
http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-language-options

This misses a few globals so I am now using env.node and setting the missing globals.

I have also added some rules like no-undef etc. These rules are based on https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style with a few differences:
  * Commas should be at the end of a line.
  * Always use semicolons.
  * Functions should not have whitespace before params.
