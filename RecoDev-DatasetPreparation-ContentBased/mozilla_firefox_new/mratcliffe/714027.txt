Is it like a transparent background? Do we see the window that is behind the Firefox window?

No, it's opaque.
I can take a look at this tomorrow.
I can reproduce this and the background is transparent (the same as the title bar). The problem is that if we put e.g. a white background behind the tools before they are initialized then it either causes more flicker. Maybe we could use a white background for each tool until it is fully initialized.
