Looks like I won't have time to fix this so feel free to take a look at it.

It seems like the way properties are added has changed and this has completely broken the crossing out of overridden properties. All new properties have overridden set to true so if we can find out why it should be easy to fix.

Glad I created domUtils.getSubpropertiesForCSSProperty() as it is exactly what we needed to fix this issue.

In the past we processed everything twice to fix this but somebody noticed and removed that hack, this is much tidier.

The test fails without the rule-view changes so this should be it.

Missing try / catch caused a failing test.

This comment should be clearer.  There was some nuance with the bug (that dummyStyle was skipping properties with an empty value) that is quite tricky to understand.  Maybe something like this:

// Manually get all the properties that are set when setting a value on
// this.name and check the computed style on dummyElement for each one.
// If we just read dummyStyle, it would skip properties when value = "".
