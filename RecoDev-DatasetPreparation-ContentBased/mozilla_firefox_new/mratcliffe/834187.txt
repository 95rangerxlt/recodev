In bug 832980 we decided to skip CSS selectors which contain namespaced type selectors e.g. :not(svg|a). This is because element.mozMatchesSelector(selector.text) raises an exception if we pass it one of these selectors.

Once we have an API from platform we need to make these rules visible again.

It feels like we're invading someone else's _privates here. Perhaps this should be public?

Should this be a member of RuleEditor? Isn't it a jsm local variable declared at the top of the file?
Same for CssLogic.jsm

It is fiddling with it's own privates but I have made it public instead.

Agreed, I have made them lazy getters.
Need to wait for a blocker.

I don't think we want that in release, and merging is soon.
Really? Release version is broken but if we are not fixing it I am more than happy.

I don't think shipping a chemspill release for such a bug is on the table.

This is old code, existing issue for many releases - we'll wait and let it ride the trains, there's no clear impetus here for uplift.
Will land after the next m-c -> fx-team merge

This patch removes `domUtils` definition but uses it in `selectorMatchesElement`.
We use a lazy getter instead of the instance member.
