One example

1. type any command 
2. while typing its options, the popup sometimes appear at wrong position. It also overlaps the input area sometimes.

This happens for all boolean options, for options of commands that are not valid and for some other cases that I am unable to pin point.

try these commands :
a. restart t
b. screenshot abc g
c. asdas era
d. screenshot abc 10

I am unable to reproduce this on Linux. Is there anybody that can try this on Windows?
I can reproduce this on Windows & OSX but not on Linux.

Fix

There is a tooltip bug on Windows and Linux that prevents them from being positioned properly. There is a panel bug on Linux that causes ugly focus issues. We now use a tooltip on Linux and a panel on OSX & Windows. I know it is ugly but the key point is that it works.

If a panel has no content and no height it is not shown when openPopup is called on Windows and OSX ... this was stopping the panel from appearing the first time it was shown (bug 692348). Setting the panel's height to 1px before calling openPopup fixes the issue as we resize it ourselves anyway.

Looks good. Please could you add a slab of docs to the function that lets people unravel what is going on? Particularly useful would be links to bugs etc. Imagine you have a bad memory and have to look at this code in a years time...
