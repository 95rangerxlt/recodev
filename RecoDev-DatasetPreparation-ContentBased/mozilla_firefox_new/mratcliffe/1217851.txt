This rule lives in:
eslint-plugin-mozilla\lib\rules\import-headjs-globals.js

It's enabled in the devtools .eslintrc file.

Its job is to check if the file name is browser_*.js and if yes, locate the nearest head.js and import all globals from there so that eslint later doesn't complain about using undefined things when linting the test.

Turns out the way the rule is implemented doesn't work on Windows.

var isTest = /.*\/browser_.+\.js$/.test(pathAndFilename);

There's an assumption in the regex that path separators are forward slashes /
Just removing this character from the regex makes it work on Windows.

We shouldn't remove the slash altogether as that would cause new errors. This patch simply changes this regex:
/.*\/browser_.+\.js$/

To this:
/.*[\\/]browser_.+\.js$/

Tests just fine on both osx and Win 10
