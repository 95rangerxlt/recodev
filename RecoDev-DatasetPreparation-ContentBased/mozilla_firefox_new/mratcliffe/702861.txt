window.onerror error fix

propertyContainer is defined as:
<div id="propertyContainer">
</div>

We get it when CssHtmlTree is instantiated: 
this.propertyContainer = this.styleDocument.getElementById("propertyContainer");

In the highlight method the following will always work unless the window is in the process of closing:
this.propertyContainer.appendChild(fragment);

This is most likely window.onerror catching errors from JS running when the window is in the process of closing. If this is the problem here then this patch should fix it.
I tested this patch (with my local changes also) and it fixes the test failures.
Is the load being triggered after destroy() is called, or is an in-progress refresh completing?

Seems like destroy() should properly cancel an in-progress refresh and prevent new refreshes from being scheduled, or we'll see other similar bugs crop up.
It seems that on my windows box this error is breaking tests. We need to cancel the panel updates etc. if the panel is destroyed.

Stop on destroy
As part of this patch can you please remove these two calls to ignoreAllUncaughtExceptions(), which I just added as part of bug 670857?

(As part of bug 703176, rather.)
Why isn't the update cancelled in the same place the propertyContainer is destroyed?

Yup, that is a better place ... done.
Shouldn't this be [land-in-fx-team]? The patch has r+.

(and assigned to mike?)
Yes, it should ... done.
