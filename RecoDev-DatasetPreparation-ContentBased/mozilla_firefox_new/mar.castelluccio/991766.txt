Like bug 774142 and bug 774144. I think on Mac we should move the application to the trash.

I think someone mentioned that we're not supposed to be using this NS_ENSURE... stuff any more. Maybe just do a normal value check.

I guess you're referring to bug 672843.  MDN doesn't yet have any doc on this (that I can find).  But the following phrase is repeated several times in the bug, and seems to be a good description:

Create the new macro NS_WARN_IF and deprecate NS_ENSURE_* in favor of the explicit warning/return style.

This looks fine to me, with the following caveat:

Apple's doc on -[NSWorkplace recycleURLs:...] has this odd comment:

> In OS X v10.6, this method requires that the main run loop be run in
> a common mode to facilitate the display of any user interface
> elements. It is safe to call this method from any thread of your
> app.

I assume this means that, at least on OS X 10.6, it'd be better to call -[NSWorkspace recycleURLs:...] on the main thread.  But I also assume that's what this code will do.
(Myk, this applies on top of bug 774144)

Thank you for the quick review! Yes, it'll run on the main thread.

This looks reasonable to me, although it doesn't apply to my current trunk, and the conflict is non-trivial.  Did you base it on another change?

Yes, see comment 5. I'll admit the note was difficult to see because it has the same format of a "(In reply to ..." :P

Aha!  Setting dependency accordingly.
