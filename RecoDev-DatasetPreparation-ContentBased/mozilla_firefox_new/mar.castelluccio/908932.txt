Review of attachment 794950:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This seems right to me, but can you briefly explain why we don't need it anymore?  According to the code you're removing, we expected it to become useful again, which is why we didn't remove it when we stopped using it initially.  Presumably, now that we know more about how we're going to implement support for privileged apps, it turns out that the code won't be useful; but the bug doesn't actually say that.

A bug like this would be easier to review if it had a description explaining the reason for the change being made!

We don't need it anymore because security handling is now "built-in" in Gecko (nsIPrincipal and nsIDocShell).
We just need to set the application ID on the DocShell to have all the security features we want.
