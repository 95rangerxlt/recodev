toolkit_webapps_tests_cleanup

We've added several tests lately, we can move the shared code to head.js.

This patch introduces a TestAppInfo class that contains the necessary info about the app (installPath, installedFiles, updatedFiles, etc.).

This should also make it simpler to write tests involving multiple apps.
