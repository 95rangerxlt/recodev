r- from me based on the lack of updated string ids for some of the changed strings.

The strings whose id I didn't change were introduced only yesterday, they merely had the wrong value. Do these ids really have to be changed as well?
If they're in mozilla-central, then yes.

Also, at this point strings added should be good for life.

The answer to that is most definitely YES ;-D

Had I just localized these strings as-is yesterday, and not made the effort to
report the discrepancy, I would have no way of knowing that you afterwards had
corrected the strings...

A rule of thumb:
If you land a string, and afterwards have to correct it in some way that
changes the meaning (in the broadest sense), you will have to change the
corresponding key as well... Otherwise localizers will have no chance to
discover your change...

We don't monitor every developer push, but we do monitor changes in string
keys, and that's our signal that something need our attention.

I know that this is burdensome, because you'll also have to change the
underlying references to the string in .js files and what not, but apart from
cases of obvious typos where we localizers can figure out what the intended
string should be, changing key is paramount.
Thanks guys, makes sense. Definitely wasn't laziness on my part, just didn't realise it mattered even for short-term fixes like these. Will prep a new patch.

Thanks, looks much better.

Reading the patch, I do see a comment that asks for consistency between Sync and syncBrand.dtd, which made me wonder, do we have any overall guidance on localizing "Sync Key"? Asking that without having looked at more code than the context of this patch, really.

I'm not aware of any l10n guidelines regarding Sync Key. Faaborg might know more as he coined the term. For visual context, see the mockups in bug 589980. The Sync Key can also be saved or printed, see bug 591533 for mockups.
Anyone using a screen reader is likely going to want to save or email instead of print, but otherwise they are going to copy and paste it back in on the second computer, just as everyone else will.
ok, for some reason just provided an a11y answer... in terms of l10n it should map to the metaphor of a physical key that one might use to unlock a physical lock.  If the CS term and the physical item are named with different terms, be sure to use the physical item's name.
