The proposed experience encompasses

1. The ability to turn on a more active variant of Do Not Track that actually blocks tracking (through a pref)
2. Some indicator in the browser (analogous to our mixed content indication) that DNT is being enforced for the current site/page
3. The ability to turn tracking-blocking off for a site while on it if the blocking is causing a user to have difficulties with the site (should be unusual).

Added to Iteration 33.2
I'll have to deal with a different fire drill next week, so I'm unassigning myself again for now.
*** Bug 1033880 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Philipp, I'm so glad you're working on this. I didn't know about this bug until now and did some work in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1033880 to try to write down what we are thinking about. Can we meet sometime this week to talk about the flow requirements?

Thanks,
Monica

UI Mockup

This shows the preferences UI, the notification UI and the control UI for tracking blocking.
It is, in large parts, merged with the UI for mixed content. Further description is in the mockup.

Really like this mockup, Philipp!

One thing to think about is the ctrl-I functionality and Larry. How does the tracking protection shield interact with instances where we pop up Larry on a site?

It shouldn't interact with Larry at all. Larry extends from the site identity icon and not from the shield, so they can happily coexist :)
I'm not sure what you mean by ctrl-I functionality. That opens page info which is entirely separate.
Is there a separate bug for tracking what sites break tracking protection? Or a bug to put a "report why you unblocked this site?" thing back in so that we can easily report sites that break it?
