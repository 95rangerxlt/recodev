Bugs that are fixed solely by deleting code are fun.

Um.. This looks alright but I don't get it :)

Was there a but in the sidebar's hide/show methods? I think paul wrote that code, you should have a chat with him.
Also, how about writing a test for this so we don't regress it in the future?
And apart from buts you should also talk with paul about bugs.

I thought I did, but it appears I accidentally got a working solution rather than being correct in my understanding of why it was broken.

I don't believe so. Upon closer examination, if EITHER the tabbox is hidden/shown OR the splitter is collapsed/uncollapsed, it works fine. But if BOTH are done, then it never reopens. So I'm chalking it up to the some interaction between the XUL element states of the splitter and the tabbox.


> Also, how about writing a test for this so we don't regress it in the future?

Good call. Now that I correctly understand what happened I'll add a test.

* Use the ToolSidebar's hide/show mechanism instead of the splitter
* Add tests that confirm the behavior of showing/hiding the inspection sidebar

I think you can also remove the collapse attribute.
