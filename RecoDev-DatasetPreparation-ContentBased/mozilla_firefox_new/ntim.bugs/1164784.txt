Possible fixes :
- Use the devtools-toolbarbutton class and the standalone attribute and remove current hardcoded code (seems best to me to do this)
- Add -moz-appearance: none to the hardcoded code

I think the fix in bug 1163384 will also work here -- was this on aurora?

It surely will, although there is still code duplication.
I mean does bug 1163384 fix this issue? Can we turn this bug into remove duplicated styling for those button via standalone attribute?

I can't test as this isn't on latest nightly yet. But manually adding the devtools-toolbarbutton class on the button using the Browser Toolbox works.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: 1167252, the new performance tool
[User impact if declined]: Won't ship the performance tool
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: There are try pushes in Bug 1167252 with all patches needing uplift
[Risks and why]: Requesting uplift for the accumulated changes in the performance tool since the 40 merge date, so these changes haven't had the full 6 weeks to bake.  Risks are generally contained within devtools, specifically within the performance panel.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
