[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: This breaks Firefox when built as a xulrunner application
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low. On mozilla builds, we're effectively changing an url to another url that resolves to the exact same location.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None

Is there a reason for the qa-?
qa- simply means this bug is not a first priority for verification by QA. We don't have time nor resources to verify all bugs so we have to prioritize. Apologies for not clarifying earlier. 

If you think this bug is critical to be verified before we ship Firefox 17 please make a justification.

Thanks.
