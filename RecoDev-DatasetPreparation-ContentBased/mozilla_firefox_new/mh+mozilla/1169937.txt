and is caused by bug 1168251. Can't have nice things.

Explicitly build the export target only under config/ during l10n builds

The issue roots in the fact that l10n builds are doing "make -C config", which recurses DIRS for export, libs and tools, and now recurses directories under config/ for compile. Now, the reason we're doing "make -C config" is that we want nsinstall to be built, which happens during export. So just do that target instead of all of them. This has the advantage of working across all branches, too.

r+. Out of curiosity, is nsinstall a special case to get built in export rather than tools ?

Yes, there are explicit dependencies that make it built early during the build, because everything else needs it. Building it as part of export is one of those.

Amending subject since it's not just win32.

Looks like "...target=['export']..." may fix that.

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-central&revision=14be4237f855&filter-searchStr=l10n&exclusion_profile=false shows 2 green linux64 builds now. Hopefully it will work for other platforms as well.
We're missing localized builds again from the last 3 days
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-l10n/

The only one updated is Arabic. Is it still the same bug or a new one?
No, it's a different one.


No localized nightly builds of Firefox (since May 27)
