Patch v1.

This is a review for m-c even know the patch will need to be rebased slightly to land on m-c. 

After review, it will land at the same time on m-c as the new dir service provider string define (soon).

wrong bug?

Not quite sure what the point of this change was, because you weren't guessing the name of the executable here?


browser shell use of NS_XPCOM_CURRENT_PROCESS_DIR breaks with bug 755724
