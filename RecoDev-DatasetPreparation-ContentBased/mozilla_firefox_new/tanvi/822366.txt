Oops, this doesn't work on hi-dpi OS X -- you'll get http://cl.ly/image/161t2Z3m060Z.

You need to to:

* add a identity-icons-https-mixed-active@2x.png image that's twice the resolution + jar.mn entry

* add an appropriate rule for it in this @media block

Change Site Identity Icon for Mixed Active Content v6

I'm adding a new patch that should fix the bug that Justin identified in comment 2.  Except, that I need a 32x32 image of the mixed content triangle icon.  For now, I have populated /browser/themes/pinstripe/identity-icons-https-mixed-active@2px.png with a copy of /browser/themes/pinstripe/identity-icons-https-mixed-active.png

I'm going to mark this for review now in case there are any changes.  I won't land until I have the new image and have updated /browser/themes/pinstripe/identity-icons-https-mixed-active@2px.png with it.  Thanks!

The suffix used on hidpi images is "@2x", not "@2px".

The patch looks fine, otherwise.

Sorry, changed it to 2x.  Now we just need the icon from Stephen.

Looks good. (Well, I only looked at the tiny hidpi changes, so this is really r=dao)

Contingency icon

Here's a crudely-scaled version of the icons. 10 seconds of work. It would be ok to land with this to take the immediate pressure off our beloved shorlander. ;-) [If this happens, please file a followup to get true hidpi images in before final release.]

This incorporates Stephen's new icon.  Dolske, can you test it?

Yep, icon works properly in hidpi mode now.
