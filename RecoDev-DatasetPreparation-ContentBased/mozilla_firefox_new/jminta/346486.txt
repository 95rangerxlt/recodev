This patch makes 3 different tweaks I've seen recommended to the notification we display.
1.) Don't hardcode the app-name as Firefox.
2.) End the sentence with a period.
3.) Use the host, rather than 'this site.'

Why same '%S'?
Localizers cannot omit brand name, and cannot change order.
IMHO first '%S' should be '%brand%' and replaced by brandShortName.


But I'm not an official localizer, please ask them first.

I followed the same format as the popup warning:

Good with the verbiage tweaks, make sure we actually pass both variables. Have you tested this to ensure it works? I bet you have, you smartie!

I did test, but I don't understand the "make sure we actually pass both variables" bit.  When would we not?  are you afraid we'll end up with something like "Firefox will now block images from Firefox."?  If that's the concern, getFormattedString is smart enough to handle that.

r=me, but you need to rev the property names so l10n sees this

also a=me, so this gets in ASAP, this is a simple string change necessary to fix inappropriate use of branding strings.
For future reference, it helps a great deal to use explicit ordering in properties, i.e., 

%1$S will now always block images from %2$S.

A localization note to describe both params is generally good to have, too.
Landed on both trunk and branch.
