There's a number of calls to getCurrentWindow() that could be cached and stored as gWindow as that shouldn't change for a given tabcandy view in a browser window.

Add aliases for gWindow, gBrowser, gTabDeck, gTabFrame for the tabcandy chrome context. Update uses and simplify some code like removing Navbar.

Mardak, this is awesome! Much cleaner. 

My only comment is that maybe gTabDeck and gTabFrame should be named so that it's clear that they refer to the Tab Candy UI (rather than the tab bar). Maybe gTabViewDeck?
