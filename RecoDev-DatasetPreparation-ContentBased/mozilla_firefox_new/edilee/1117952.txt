STR:
 1. Start a Firefox debug build from a terminal.
 2. Open a new tab page.
 3. Inspect the warningspew in your terminal.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Terminal contains a warning like this:
{
[Parent 16149] WARNING: Failed to open external DTD: publicId "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" systemId "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd" base "https://dtex4kvbppovt.cloudfront.net/images/0e6031675a9c491dd0c65e9c67cfbf54a5880f17.2295.svg" URL "resource://gre/res/dtd/svg11.dtd": file /scratch/work/builds/mozilla-central/mozilla-central.11-08-17.14-31/mozilla/parser/htmlparser/nsExpatDriver.cpp, line 703
}
This is letting you know that this SVG file has a needless "doctype" declaration. See bug 1023655 and https://jwatt.org/svg/authoring/#doctype-declaration for more info.


EXPECTED RESULTS: This SVG file should not have a needless DOCTYPE declaration (and this terminal-spew should not be present).


I don't know where the right place is to file bugs on tweaking this SVG file (at https://dtex4kvbppovt.cloudfront.net/images/0e6031675a9c491dd0c65e9c67cfbf54a5880f17.2295.svg ).  It's for a Mozilla product (Thimble) being advertised via the New Tab page, so I'm starting in the New Tab component, and hoping someone here knows who the right people to CC might be, and where this should be categorized.

This is still a problem; I saw this go by in my terminalspew today, when opening a new tab.

The SVG file seems to live here currently:

Ed, do you know who I can get in touch with to fix that ^ file? (hosted at https://tiles.cdn.mozilla.net)

(The <!DOCTYPE line should just be removed.)
