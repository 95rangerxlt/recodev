Remove Tabs.open and BrowserWindow.addTab and directly deal with xul tabs.

Looks good. One comment: you're using "let" instead of "var" at one point; I thought we had settled to stick with var?
Oh, I guess we can switch it back to var. But "let is the new var" ;) Most new code in firefox is using let I believe.

Just discussed it with mitcho and gavin. Gavin's recommendation is to leave all the existing vars but use let for all new code. Sounds good to me.
