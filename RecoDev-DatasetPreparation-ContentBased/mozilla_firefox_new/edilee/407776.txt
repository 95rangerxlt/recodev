Why are we running the code above each time, anyways? Seems like we could split
it out into it's own method that's called from invalidate() before calling
_appendCurrentResult, or just move it into invalidate.

note, if we get support for rows (see bug #401939) this code goes away completely.

It would be necessary to show the results on the first search because when the very first UI chunk is processed, there's no _rowHeight set. But then on the second UI chunk (even if there's nothing to append), it'll be able to use the height of the first item.
