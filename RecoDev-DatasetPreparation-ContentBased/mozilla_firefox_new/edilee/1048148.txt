In Aarons latest mockups (e.g. http://ytjbre.axshare.com/enhanced_view_-_concept_1.html) the corners have a smaller border radius and the hover-glow is reduced quite a bit.

Notes: Confirm corner radius
dcrobot, what's the sizing information for the new glow? Any color changes?

Via Aaron
Radius = 8  (I'm guessing that's in px)

Glow = #4CB1FF, x = 0, y = 1, blur = 6, spread = 2

Aaron can you just confirm this?
One change... y = 0

so, Glow = #4CB1FF, x = 0, y = 0, blur = 6, spread = 2
