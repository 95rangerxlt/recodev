When using Save Page As with bugzilla attachments, the default filename is attachment.cgi, not the real file name.

This is totally my fault.  Gotta love try/catch.

Is there actually more than one expected error, so the catch block can't just check for that and rethrow any other errors?
Dunno.  Looking at nsDOMWindowUtils::GetDocumentMetadata I wouldn't expect this code to ever get an exception to start with, so I have no idea why someone stuck a try/catch here.
Looks to me like we'll have to ask you either way: bug 263697 first, then bug 264757.
Ah, that first checkin had the try/catch because the "get to window utils" part could throw.
