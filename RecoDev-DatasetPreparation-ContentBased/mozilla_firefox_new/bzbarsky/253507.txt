mode and tried t open this saved page. almost all images from this page didn't
appear.
When i searched stored file for url ot this images, they was local
<img src="biser_files/strek_01.jpg" alt="Стрекоза"
_base_href="http://win.mail.ru/cgi-bin/readmsg" border="1" height="345"
width="300"></center>

Example of _base_href attribute

I don't know about such an attribute, but Mozilla seems to support the
_base_href attribute.
See this testcase link. In Mozilla it will take you to google. In Opera and IE
you're staying at the same page.
Serzh, can you point to a particular site that shows this problem so that a
potential fix could be tested?

jst, what do you think?  The other possibility is to hack the HTML content sink
to ignore the _base_href attribute coming from the parser... but that seems
rather uncalled-for.

This is public e-mail server www.mail.ru. I was seeng HTML letter in his
web-interface and then saved page with this letter. Saved page i attached packed
in gzip format. Why do you need web-site? Do you think that Firefox not properly
saved this page. IMHO, page saved ok, but Firefox cannot properly display it...
In IE this saved page is ok.
> Do you think that Firefox not properly saved this page.

I don't just think it, I know it.  The proposed patch is a patch to the code
that saves pages to make it not screw up the page as it saves it.
