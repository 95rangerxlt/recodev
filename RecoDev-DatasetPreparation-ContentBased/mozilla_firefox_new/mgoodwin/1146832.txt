screenshot of issue

Firefox 37.0 Beta, Build ID 20150319212106, on Windows 8.1

There is an ugly wrapping of the label with the submission status for a certificate pinning error in localizations with texts longer than English.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Use a localized build, e.g. a German one (language code 'de'). Get it from https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/latest-beta/
2. Open https://pinningtest.appspot.com/
3. Report that certificate error.

Actual result:
After hitting the button for submitting the error, the localized labels for "Sending report" (German: "Bericht wird gesendet…") and "Report sent" (German: "Bericht gesendet") get wrapped with the text starting on the right and ending on the left.

Fort the "Report sent" label, many more languages should be affected according to http://transvision.mozfr.org/string/?entity=browser/chrome/overrides/netError.dtd:errorReporting.sent&repo=beta

L10n list for the 'sending' string: http://transvision.mozfr.org/string/?entity=browser/chrome/overrides/netError.dtd:errorReporting.sending&repo=beta

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
This looks dumb (on l10n builds) and we should fix that.

Monica, can you nominate someone to look at this? I'm not sure who else has done work with the pinning/TP UI here...
I think that mgoodwin knows the most about the SSL error reporting page. I also heard from psackl that this page may be restyled?
This is ugly but given that we're building the 37 RC today and this is not an issue that I expect the majority of the release population to encounter, I don't think that we should block on it. If there is a trivial fix I'm happy to consider it if we need an RC2.

I'm tracking for 38 as I don't want to release as second version with this issue.
I'll take a look at this

Changed so that wrapping is less likely - and looks better when it happens.

I'm not sure who would be a good reviewer for this. Any suggestions?
Hey Mark, could you upload a screenshot of the patch showing how the text breaks now?
Thanks!

This doesn't belong in a script. Can you use reportSendingMsg.style.removeProperty("display") here and set display in the style sheet?

> #reportingState {
>-  padding-left: 150px;

Can you document where does this number comes from?

nit: space after colon

Does this work as expected for right-to-left languages? I assume it doesn't...

How does this handle even longer strings? Looks like it might overlap the "More Information..." link?

How about using inline-block or flexbox layout for both the link and the status label instead of display:block and float?

We're showing and hiding elements here (since we want the localized strings to some from a single source) - what's the preferred way of doing this?

It looks fine (see the three screenshot attachments)

I'll look at using flexbox - this will likely improve the right-to-left situation (although this patch is no worse than the current situation).

Like I said, style.removeProperty("display") for showing the element such that it uses its default display as specified in style sheets.
Mark, any news on this? Thanks

Modified to address dao's feedback (in particular to make use of flexbox layout)

It now works better for right-to-left languages (messages and buttons appear in expected positions).

Philipp, do you need new screenshots? You can test this by hitting any site with a non-overrideable TLS error.

reportBtn is unused

You can (should) also remove "div" from the selector, #errorStatePanel works just fine.

This doesn't seem to have any meaningful effect? I removed it and seemingly got the same result.
position: relative; and display: block; don't seem to be needed either... Am I missing something?

Addressed feedback in comment 17 and comment 18, specifically:
* fixed bad indentation in aboutNetError.xhtml
* removed unused variable (reportBtn) in content.js
* added missing space before 'flex' in aboutNetError.css
* removed unnecessary 'div' from selector
* removed "position: relative" and "display:block" from reportingState and reportingStateMessage since they weren't needed
* removed "button#reportCertificateError" and "#button:reportCertificateErrorRetry" sections from aboutNetError.css since they only contained items that had no effect

The difference is subtle but I noticed omitting it made the message sit above the line of the link on the left.

I still don't understand what's going on here. Where did you get that number from? Trial and error? Or is there actually some CSS somewhere setting the link's line-height to 22px?

Does this still work as expected when setting a minimum font size in the content/fonts preferences?

There's some CSS setting that - as seen through use of the devtools inspector on the link. I'm guessing it's from here https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/shared/in-content/common.inc.css#394

I would imagine so. I'll test and let you know if not.

Ok, can you please remove that? It makes no sense as far as I can tell.

Shouldn't this be in a follow up? I'm not at all confident doing this won't break something else and, from reading the comments above, it's likely people will want uplift.

Do they? This UI is currently disabled, isn't it? I had to flip a hidden pref to see it.

This UI is not currently disabled. All non-overridable TLS errors hit this UI currently.
Ok, please file a followup bug then? Or just upload a second patch taking care of it only for mozilla-central here.
