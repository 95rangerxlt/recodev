bug1137481.more.v1.patch

This fixes:

- all fonts inherit SIZE and FAMILY from system. (No need to specify)
- border-bottom, because boxShadow (outset) doesn't work for NotificationBox
- messageText.flex = 0 ; to collaps the space before the stars.  (unclear how to add space back in!)
- smaller stars (16px) and heartbeat (24) icon, per UX request. 
- "revert" close button style.

To be done:

The spacing should be something like:  
  Y X [heart] X [message] X [stars]  

for Y = 6, X = 8 (maybe?). This needs some experimentation.

A little more space between the copy and the stars.
Could we change from "Please rate Firefox" to "Give Mozilla your rating of Firefox" ? I think this would make it a lot more clear what the purpose is and also take advantage of how wide this notification bar is.

> Is there a page ready for a "Learn more" to be linked to?

Hey Sevaan. We created a public wiki page for Heartbeat to link to from the release notes. 

Check it here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Advocacy/heartbeat

That is where the "Tell me more" or "What is this?" link would take the user. Since Heartbeat is persistent across tabs they would see that it is indeed from Mozilla and still have the opportunity to give us a score.
## General Problem To Be Solved (or Not!)

- unclear who is asking is for the rating and what purpose.

## Some paths of solution

1. educational compaigns
2. decide it's not a problem for most people, and do the natural experiment.
3. change the question.
4. link to help / more info / messaging authority in UI element. 
5. Wait a bit and think more (not beta 2 uplift, let it sit a week or two).

(I favor 4: Link/Authority!)


## Ideas for Option 4: Linking To Help / Authority.

### disclaimer:  these ideas are incomplete and intended to spark discussion!

1.  Do nothing, close the bug, force lift

Good: 
- easy (lazy!)
- makes it "someone else's problem"

Bad:
- deal with complaints that people don't know what this is, and what it's doing.
- authority confusion.


2.  "Old style" Nb Button with text. "more info"

Good:
- mostly fast to impelement
- already

Bad:
- ugly, disimilar styling
- buttons close the bar by default
- needs localization (string!), for TEXT and TOOLTIP unless we reuse an existing translation

3.  Reuse other existing help buttons (like from #about:preferences)

Good 
- looks nice, similar to 'close button'

Bad
- needs localization (string!) for TOOLTIP, unless we reuse an existing translation

4.  Some other "this is a Message from Mozilla" indications.  (Icons, 'small text')
I'm all for 4 as well, as long as we have UX approval :)
Please add a "Learn more." after the copy. The hyperlink colour should be #0095DD.

Heartbeat-v3-Windows.PNG

The "Please Rate Firefox" text seems to be a pixel higher than the Learn more. Also, why are we not doing this as a sentence? "Please rate Firefox. Learn More." as oppose to two different elements?
0.  Baby firefoxes are wonderful and cute.
1.  (Alessio is investiating the 1px thing.  They look the same on OSX.  Will be fixed, good catch!)
2.  Two questions in one there.
  a.  I would defer to Matej or you on whether different color and styling is enough to distinguish sentences.  I claim periods for neither, but adding periods is not a big deal.  (It should be 'Learn more' [lowercase m) probably though, in any case.  I hate seeing periods inside links.  No version of this has ever had a period for the command.  
  b.  Two different elements.  Once is a message, one is an <A> link?  I am confused about this critique or am misunderstanding it.  People clicking on the message shouldn't open learn more (or should it?  Is that the solution?  PS, that actually sounds like an awesome solution, because then we could trash the learn more!)

3.  Bonus question... MSG => STARS spacing.  As shown:  window: 12px,  osx: 8px.  Confirm that 12 is right :)
To summarize some re-brainstorm here :)

- either this EXISTING TEXT or the ICON could be the link instead, if that is better.
Created attachment 8573376
osx-showing-both-icon-message-as-link-in-hover-state

Gives underline only during hover on text.  No visible styling of icon.  

Pluses:  
- no rating task interference

Minues:
- introduces a new pattern: blindly hover / click on a pieces of the toolbar to know what they are.   
- less discoverable.

How does localization of that page work? Should it appear instead on SUMO or MDN?
Please no underline. 

Matej, please look at this attachment: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8573168

I proposed that the Learn more should be part of the sentence: "Please rate Firefox. Learn more." What are your thoughts? Gregg's thoughts:

At this point Heartbeat is EN only. We'll tackle the localization hurdle when we get there, but SUMO or MDN do sound like good choices.

I am generally in agreement on the above, though we do sometimes use "Learn more." (with the period) as a link, especially if it's part of a paragraph or follows a longer sentence.

In this specific example, I think setting it off the way it is and making it blue is good enough, though I agree that it should be a lowercase m.

The other option would be to put it on the other side of the stars so they're more tied to the rating, rather than the "Learn more" line.

Let's also use a lowercase r in "Please rate Firefox"

Thanks.
Thanks Matej. Updated mockup: http://cl.ly/image/0n1W0H0y0Z0b

Note that at the end it says "What is this?" instead of Learn more. I checked with Matej over IRC that this was okay.

Not sure off the top of my head. Each inherited style has it's own size and line height based on the system font.

Jaws, would you be able to chime in here? It feels like there are a lot of specified measurements in this that shouldn't be hard-coded (I could be wrong though)

Yes, different platforms/environments have different default font-sizes. It is better to use a relative unit of measurement here, such as `em`, `ch`, or `rem`. `ch` is usually the most reliable for widths of characters, as 1ch is defined as the width of the `0` character in the specified font and font-size.

Looks good. Only comment is that the "What is this?" text should have the same spacing between it and the close X as the "Please rate Firefox" text has between it and the Heartbeat logo.

There is way too much overriding of CSS for the notification bar and I let it go for the initial landing since it was going to be a temporary short-term thing but now it's turning into a bigger ordeal and more time is being spent on it. Chameleon should be implemented at the toolkit level in a separate bug so we can stop doing one-off overrides for notification bars. Until that's implemented we should live with the style we have for consistency and maintainability.

I don't know of a bug and it's not clear what the current status is so I would rather not rely on it. Dozens of other notification bars are fine with the default style.

I don't know that it really is unless someone actually works on it. I was against the one-off for translation from the beginning but that was around a year ago probably and we still are stuck with the tech-debt.

I didn't know you had tested old notification bars. This is all the more reason to implement Chameleon for all notification bars.

> - Because this design rev is *also* instrumented, it will be easy to know
> whether to revert it, or 'try again'.  

I thought you just said above you already had data that these are better. We also already used Chamelon for translation notification bars. Why do we need more data?

That's because we're trying to fit in with the platform and that's why we have separate theme directories for each platform.

It's not contained when we make fixes to the notification bars e.g. bug 1047977 (which has to be special-cased for the 2 Chameleon notification bars).

That seems like scope creep on Heartbeat and an excuse to plow though with adding technical debt. We already had the translation notifications to test out Chameleon if we wanted to.

Unnecessary !important adds technical debt too and makes it harder for add-ons to theme so that's what I want to make sure they're necessary.
(MattN, point us to existing Notification bars that are in Chameleon style. This is news to me, and might have changed things had we known earlier.)

Remove :not([value="translation"]) on these since you won't ever be both a heartbeat and a translation notification.

Yes, I'm trying to align the stars vertically, with the content of the notification description (the text).
Comment on attachment 8576001

Unfortunately, I could not find a better way to center the stars container vertically, as the hbox isn't taking all the space: for this reason I could not make -moz-box-align and -moz-box-pack. I left the margin-bottom:4px, as done in [1].
