Proposed patch

4401 INFO TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/devtools/webaudioeditor/test/browser_wa_properties-view-media-nodes.js | Found an unexpected Browser:WebRTCGlobalIndicator at the end of test run - Found an unexpected Browser:WebRTCGlobalIndicator at the end of test run

My patches from bug 1037408 and bug 1037430 got backed out due to this test failure. These bugs are important for Firefox 33 and contain localizable strings, so they should land before the next merge to Aurora (Monday).

I've been able to reproduce the failure with a local opt build on my Windows machine, and to write a fix (attached). I've pushed the attached patch to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=798e9b93af1f
