I white-list my sites that can set cookies, and I was hoping to start using the "page info" -> permissions dialog, since all my normal cookie management add ons are busted on trunk (and disabled) for the time being.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the options dialog,  "accept cookies from sites" is unchecked
2. Go to a site that sets a cookie
3. right click -> page info
4.  select "permissions" tab
5. uncheck "use default"
6. click on "Allow"
7. close the "page info" dialog
8. open the "page info"->"permissions" dialog again

Actual Results:  
The permissions dialog shows "use default" is still unchecked, but "block" is selected instead of "allow".  If you open up the cookie exceptions dialog from Tools->Options, you will see that a meaningless "Block" exception has been created.

just for the record, if an "allow" exception is created through Tools->Options->privacy->"exceptions...", ((close "options" window, copy/paste the domain name) or (re-type the domain name)), and click "allow", then going back into the "page info"->"permissions" window will show the correct "allow" exception.

Expected Results:  
Because cookies are not accepted by default, clicking "Allow" needs to create an exception.  I was almost going to complain that a "Block" exception should never be created in this situation even if "block" was clicked in the "permissions" dialog, but I can imagine some users might switch between a default block and default allow, and have needs for both types of exceptions at different times.  At any rate, clicking "allow" should definitely not create a "block" exception.


This last bit is just my opinion -  anyone whose browsing habits and choices require exceptions to their cookie policy will have to get cookiesafe or some other add-on to use instead of all this, anyway.   I can only imagine the type of people who have 0 exceptions and people who have many exceptions.  The Tools->Options->Privacy->"Exceptions..." method and "Page info"->"Permissions" interface are unrealistically cumbersome for regular use, unless there is such thing as a person who will want between 1 and 10 exceptions.

Sorry for the spam, but I take back that last comment, as it applies to "view page info"->"Permissions".  Once it is working, it will be much more convenient than the previously existing exceptions mechanism.
This error appears in the Error Console each time a cookie radio button is clicked:

It turns out to be a one character fix. I'm surprised I didn't catch this last year.
If you want this patch to land in the M8 freeze, you need to request approval1.9 on the patch.
In the M8 freeze, or after the M8 freeze, either one, actually.
