Patch

Seems to be my mistake in bug 1120546, waiting for the webRTC-sharingDevices notification to be removed is probably not enough because it can be removed either as a result of the page reloading and the PopupNotifications code dropping old notifications, or as a result of MediaManager canceling gUM requests.
