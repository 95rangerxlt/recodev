I noticed there is a lot of blank space in the forms tab with all that info at
the bottom, half of it is just white space.
If you move the splitter too far down, the botom box disappears.

Still same issue, with xp home edition, with 0.9.3.  low priority, righ?
by the way this happen to the "Froms" also, (Tools--Page Info--Froms or Media).
 



indeed, the page info-dialog isn't touched before the 1.0 release, so there
won't be a change to it untill the aviary-branch is remerged to the trunk.
i guess that after that, when the page-info dialog will be redone, this will be
fixed.

setting os to all since it happens on linux also
