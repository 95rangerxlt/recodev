document-content-type

This patch adds a browser.documentContentType field to the browser.xml and remote-browser.xml XBL bindings. For remote-browser.xml, we send the data on each web progress notification. This allows us to correctly set the isImage broadcaster, which is used by a bunch of things in Firefox.
