skip-remove-busy

We used to set the "busy" attribute when starting to restore a tab. However, this code was removed in bug 597901 since it should be set automatically from onStateChange in tabbrowser.xml. It looks like that patch missed some code that removed the attribute if the load failed. I think that should be taken care of by the WebProgressListener as well.
