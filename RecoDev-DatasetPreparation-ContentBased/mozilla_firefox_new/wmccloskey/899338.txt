backspace-fix

Right now we've worked around the backspace handling problem in the larch repo by deleting the command that calls BrowserHandleBackspace(). However, it's still a problem on mozilla-central. This patch does pretty much the same thing, but it only disables the command when gMultiProcessBrowsing is set.

Obviously we'd like to fix this the right way in the future. However, we're trying to make m-c usable for multiprocess browsing by mid-August.
