I was testing some add-ons in Aurora and there's an exception that gets thrown when we call Cu.getJSTestingFunctions().objectAddress(), which is Nightly-only. It prevents the shims from working properly. How embarrassing.

This is a bug in some logging code that was supposed to be disabled anyway. It only causes trouble on Aurora because it uses a debugging function that's only enabled on Nightly. I think we should take this on Aurora ASAP since it causes a bunch of add-ons to be broken there when e10s is enabled.

Somehow I forgot to land this on central. Anyway, now it's fixed on central and on the new aurora.
