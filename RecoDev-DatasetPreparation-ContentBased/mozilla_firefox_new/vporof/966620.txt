How about using something in between of red and yellow (a more subtle color) than pinkish-red ?
I'm using the red color from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors
How about using Light Orange ?
Red means something bad happened. I'm using the red defined in the color palette by our designer.

Review of attachment 8369053:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The code changes look good.  Since this was already using a red color before, I'm fine with sticking with the defined theme red colors.  If we decide this is more of a 'warning' case than an 'error' case, we should consider switching to some orange color.
