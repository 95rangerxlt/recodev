This string should be "Show variables search box" instead.
And actually, since the box it displays is a filter, perhaps it should be "Show variables filter box" instead?
While at it, can that filter box be moved above the add watch expression ? Appearance wise, it look odd to have black toolbar, then white space then again black toolbar with search box.

or may bey change the theme of the filter box.

No, these are two different panes, each with it's own functionality. Furthermore, the search box is not necessary (and disabled by default) because there's an operator available for the toolbar search box.

OK, but with the same caveat as in bug 816548.

When we fix our bastard half-dark, half-light theme, this will no longer be an issue.

Renamed a few variables in debugger-toolbar to make things consistent.
