v1 - added scope + fixed tests

Per a discussion in bug 676592, the property view may need a "Closure" scope.

"Apparently WebKit also displays a "Closure" scope in some cases. For example, when the execution pauses at the first debugger statement in:

http://htmlpad.org/debugger/

This is in the eval code. I'm not sure whether it's more helpful than putting it in the local scope, nor if our engine will expose that bit of information."
