I would only note that you are converting a number of child selectors to the more expensive descendant selectors. Is this really necessary?

I like that you noticed this :) Those nodes are not direct descendants on Linux anymore. There's a different internal DOM structure for the checkboxes on that magnifique platform. So instead of duplicating the rules in the designated themes/linux/shadereditor.css file, or having two different selectors for the same thing in the themes/common/shadereditor.inc.css file, I resorted to the simpler approach of converting the direct descendant selector to a more generic one.

It's also worth noting that, although the MDN article advises against generic descendant selectors (and I've been using the arguments in that article more than once when cleaning up my own styles *and* convincing others of the validity of efficient selectors), it was brought to my attention many times that our CSS parsers are very efficient now and "writing efficient selectors" is overrated. Moreover, since (in Gecko at least) selectors are parsed from right to left, and there are significantly less checkboxes than other elements in the Shader Editor, worrying about performance is not entirely justified at this time.
