I'm getting tired of seeing the breadcrumbs stackframes jump around whenever I'm hovering an identifier in the debugger. This happens because we're eval'ing the identifier, which blows away the stack, so we need to fetch and rebuild everything. However, there's absolutely no benefit in animating the stackframes every. single. time.
