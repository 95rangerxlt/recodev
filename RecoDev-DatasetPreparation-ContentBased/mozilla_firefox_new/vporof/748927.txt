Bug 741324 allows remote debugging to work, but the UI consists of config prefs. We should surface two UI pieces:
a) a button/menu item that launches/stops a debugger server in the process

-pref("devtools.debugger.remote-port", 6000);
+pref("devtools.debugger.remote-port", 2929);

I know I said port 2929 last week. Panos, is this true? I just checked the patch for fennec's remote debug listener and it's on port 6000, though I'm wondering if adb forwards port 2929 on localhost?

in _connect()

+    if (this._isRemoteDebugger) {
+      this._remoteConnectionTimeout = window.setTimeout(function() {
+        // We couldn't connect to any server yet, try again...
+        if (!DebuggerController.activeThread) {
+          DebuggerController._connect();

are we doing this for a set number of timeouts? We should probably bail after 2 or 3 attempts.

debugger.properties:

+# LOCALIZATION NOTE (remoteDebuggerPromptTitle): The title displayed on the
+# debugger prompt asking for the remote host and port to connect to.
+remoteDebuggerPromptTitle=Yo!

how about "Remote Connection"?

+# LOCALIZATION NOTE (remoteDebuggerPromptMessage): The message displayed on the
+# debugger prompt asking for the remote host and port to connect to.
+remoteDebuggerPromptMessage="Welcome to the super duper Remote Debugger.\nConnect to?"

I think this string is awesome.

or we could use, "Enter hostname and port number (host:port)"

+# LOCALIZATION NOTE (remoteDebuggerReconnectMessage): The message displayed on the
+# debugger prompt asking for the remote host and port to connect to.
+remoteDebuggerReconnectMessage="No server was found dude. Try again!.\nConnect to?"
+

"Server not found. Try again? (host:port)"

dbg-server.js

 const Cu = Components.utils;
+const Cr = Components.results;

why?

We've been using port 6000 as the default in all products so far. I think I've only seen port 2929 in dcamp's sample-debug-actors code.

...and my /etc/services contains an entry for 2929:

amx-webadmin    2929/tcp    # AMX-WEBADMIN

Not too fashionable I presume, but better safe...
ok, so r+ with this left at 6000.

past, review ball is in your ... kitchen.

remoteAutoconnect seems like something that should surface in a "Don't ask me again" checkbox in the prompt. I don't mind doing that in a followup if you prefer, though.

This was to fix the catch block in openListener, right?

We can implement it in this bug, I don't mind.

Yup.
Something I forgot to note, is that the eventual UI for launching remote and chrome debugging will be buttons in the debugger UI and not menu items, as we discussed with shorlander and paul, right? We should do that in a followup though, since it will need new icons to go with it and that could take some time.

Obviously, yes. I made sure the necessary changes for such an approach would be minimal.
