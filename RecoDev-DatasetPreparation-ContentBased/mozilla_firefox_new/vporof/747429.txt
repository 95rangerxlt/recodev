New process would make sense only for chrome debugging. In all other cases, a new window is nicer for tons of reasons.

Should this bug also include a debuggee/tab selection UI in this bug?

Why should it? We could just say "One debugger per tab. You pop it in a new window, it's the same debugger for the same debuggee. Want to debug another tab? Open a new debugger".
I misremembered this bug as being for general remote fennec/b2g debugging - I need to specify how to connect to the phone I intend to debug, and which of its debuggees I'm interested in.

I guess we could just always debug the currently-visible tab, but we do still need some way to specify the debuggee to connect to.

Filed bug 748927 for this.
Note: we shouldn't be able to open a remote debugger in a new firefox instance. A simple new window should suffice.

I think in this method you should explicitly remove the toolbar's close button. It doesn't really make sense to have it there when in an external window. Also, it doesn't work.

Patch looks good, tests pass on my machine.

R+ with the above change.

Well not really in that method, it needs to be in the content js, not the jsm, because that's just a simple iframe wrapper.

Also, I guess this applies in the chrome debugging case as well, right?
