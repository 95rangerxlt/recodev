For example:

Open a webpage with a scrollbar.
Open inspector.
Open tilt.

The intro and outro animations clearly doesn't take the current scrollbar width (if present) into consideration. This makes things ugly.

Also: open a page with a small body in Tilt. For example, tbpl or about:blank. The mesh is centered in a weird way on the Y axis.

Of course it doesn't because it breaks some existing ones :)

The solution was much, much easier. No need to calculate scrollbar dimensions.
