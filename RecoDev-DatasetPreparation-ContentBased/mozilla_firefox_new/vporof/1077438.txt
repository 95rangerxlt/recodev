Just like the memory actor. This syncs all of the front-ends timeline data (memory, fps, markers), and if we land this for Gecko 35, then we will seriously reduce the amount of feature detection needed to support older Geckos.

Need to land this in 35.
Memory actor hasn't landed yet, so need to do both things here.

What part of the memory actor are you referring to? The actual actor has existed for a long time; the allocations methods more recently, but it has definitely landed.

Damn it, I accidentally some words. I meant "the memory actor usage from the timeline actor" hasn't landed yet, specifically bug 1069421.

R+, but wonder if it'd be better to have one event for all of this data, rather than 3 separate ones, like "data" that contains memory, framerate and marker data, so the front only has to listen to one event, and they'd already be synced, which would alleviate any invalid timing issues that we were discussing before. Just a nit, I'm just happy to get this in for Fx35 regardless!
Emitting everything in a single event is definitely more efficient, but I really don't want to deal with backwards compatibility issues anymore. Since the current "markers" event emits arrays, it's not natural at all to augment that with other data.

Setting qe-verify- for this patch, since it already has automated test coverage. Victor, if you think there's something manual QA should look at here, please flip the flag.
