Review of attachment 8514272:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I still don't understand why this works for tab.linkedBrowser.contentWindow.wrappedJSObject (it doesn't work for the debugger tests), but I can't see a reason to r- it as long as it turns the tests green on try. Perhaps it would be prudent to put a comment at that line saying that we're not sure why (and indeed if) this should work? Up to you.
