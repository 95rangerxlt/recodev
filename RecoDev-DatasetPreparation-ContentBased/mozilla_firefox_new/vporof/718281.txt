Also, as long as we're adding an outro transition pref, we should also add an intro transition pref.

I think we should show the transitions by default. If the speed of them is annoying, we can make it faster or slower.
Here's a use case:

I open Tilt with an element at position (0, 0) selected. I pan down and select an element at position (0, n). Then I pan the camera back up. (I personally find myself in this case).

Suppose n > 2000 (or even a smaller number). If the closing animation is really fast, then it would be annoying (too choppy/jumpy). If it's slower, it would be counter productive.

What do you think?

Ok, talked to some people and it seems everyone wants an outro animation :)
I give in. Rob, what do you think?

Cleaned up, rebased on 712096.
yes, I think a matching, closing transition is definitely nice to have and adds to the seamlessness of the visualization. Adding a pref to hide these things is fine, as long as they are enabled by default. Will review in greater depth forthwith.
