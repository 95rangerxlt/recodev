Slick. When trying it out, one thing I kept running into, not sure if something we can do right now. When dragging up, once you're in the overview chart area and you mouseup the overview graph will change selection, most likely moving you away of the flames you were looking at. Maybe similar to the other bugs where we should clamp down the mouse events to the originator (mousedown) graph
