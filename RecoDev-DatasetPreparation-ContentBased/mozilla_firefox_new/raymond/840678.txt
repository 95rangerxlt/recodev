I don't understand this bug. Doesn't seem like anything we can fix in the input.mozilla.org site. Shouldn't this be a Firefox bug and not an Input bug? Or am I missing something?
This is, indeed, a Firefox bug. This component is for the Input Server Software.
Will, James, do you object to Firefox changing the URLs to "https://"? Could you verify that https://input.mozilla.org will work OK?

It works great. In fact, I was surprised that http:// doesn't redirect and we don't send HSTS headers.
Brian, Android has a different set of URLs (starting with m.). I didn't see a blocker to bug 771788 specifically for Android.

I see there some places in the following directories which use HTTP instead of HTTPS.  Should we update them as well?
/b2g/app/
/mobile/android/app/profile/extensions/feedback@mobile.mozilla.org/
/mobile/xul/app/

Since they are all simple changes, I have just updated b2 and mobile directories
While we're at it, it looks like input.mozilla._org_ is the canonical URL, so we should probably also switch to that.

I've never seen any indication there's handling for #broken. I think that doesn't exist. We probably should take out the brokenURL thing.

This preference is being used by testpilot.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/profile/extensions/testpilot@labs.mozilla.com/modules/feedback.js#35

Jono: Do you know more about that? Can we remove that?
If you go to the above #broken url, you just end up on the feedback form (the #broken part doesn't do anything). So it "works", but doesn't do anything in particular unless metrics is tracking it somehow outside of Input.

One other thing is that we're in the process of getting the new Input to production and it should be there this month. End of March at the latest. At that point, all these urls are going to need to change again.

I'd hold off on making url changes until the new Input is in production.
We're also re-writing testpilot (bug 840108) and removing some of the "input" pieces from it (bug 841437). So for the moment we should probably just not touch that code.

It looks to me though that app.feedbackURL is a remnant from mobile XUL's about page that got copied to b2g/metro but isn't used there. So perhaps we can just remove it? 

We may want to avoid touching mobile/ in this bug too (and perhaps file a followup on them), so maybe this bug should just cover making the utilityOverlay change.

The patch only contains the utilityOverlay change.
