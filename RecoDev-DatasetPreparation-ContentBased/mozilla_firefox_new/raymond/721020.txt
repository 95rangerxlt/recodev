I am not sure what to set for HISTOGRAM() in TelemetryHistograms.h.  Please advise.

This looks really good. We need to correct the histograms but the rest is great.

Nit: Singleton used to collect telemetry data.

Let's call those NEWTAB_PAGE_* to be a tad more specific. about:telemetry shows the histogram IDs so the label don't need a common prefix.

The label should say: "New tab page is enabled."

The ID should rather be NEWTAB_PAGE_PINNED_SITES_COUNT. There can't be more than 9 pinned tabs so we can reduce '200' to '9'. The minimum is '0'. The label should say: "Number of pinned sites on the new tab page."

The ID should be NEWTAB_PAGE_BLOCKED_SITES_COUNT. The minimum value for this should be '0'. Let's keep the maximum at '100'. The label should say: "Number of sites blocked from the new tab page."
Chris, we currently plan to track whether the newtab page is enabled, the number of pinned sites and the number of blocked sites. Can you think of any other metric that we should include?

Only boolean can have min value '0' (see below link) so I used '1' instead.

Same as above.

Thanks for looping me in. 

* whether the New Tab Page is enabled
* number of pinned tabs
* number of blocked tabs (what's this defined as?)

In addition to these, it'd be valuable to track:

* how many times a user/all users clicked on 'restore'
* broken thumbnails (can we detect this?)
(In reply to Chris Lee [:clee] from comment #5)
> * number of blocked tabs (what's this defined as?)

That's the number of tabs the user explicitly removed from the grid by clicking the 'x' in the upper right.

> * how many times a user/all users clicked on 'restore'

Ok, we'll include that with bug 716543.

> * broken thumbnails (can we detect this?)

We already have a MISS/HIT count in the thumbnail protocol itself which tracks exactly this.

Right, I forgot about this. Ok, then we'll leave it as is.

Looks good, r=me. No other metrics to include for now based on Chris' comment.

Pushed to try and waiting for results.
What are the try results? Does everything look good?

It looks fine.  There are some oranges but they are not related to this patch.
