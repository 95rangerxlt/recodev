Now that we've moved into Firefox, the TabCandy button is available for placing on the button bar, but it does not appear there by default. It should be there from the start. 

Aza, please weigh in on placement. Perhaps between the forward button and the refresh button?

The correct placement of the icon is at the right end of the tabstrip. Please see:

I won't apply Mardak's patch, then, as it's for the toolbar.
I'd say we apply this for now (at least it will be there) and then move it to its appropriate location later.

This patch moves the tabcandy button at the right end of the tabstrip.  If the tabcandy button doesn't appear, please try to restore the default set using the customize window.
Patch applied here:

... but it removed the "all tabs" button, which I've added back here:
