patch v1

* Item.defaultSize is a legacy property that's only set but not accessed anywhere.

* The test browser_tabview_bug595020.js has been removed from the Makefile quite some time ago but we somehow forgot to remove the test file itself.

* I'm not sure what we needed Storage.wipe() for but it's not used anywhere.

* GroupItems.getStorageData() isn't called anywhere, too.
