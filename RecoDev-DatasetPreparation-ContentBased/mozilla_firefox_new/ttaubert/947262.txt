DocumentUtils.restoreFormValue() fires a change event when trying to restore the value of a <select> field even if it doesn't find a matching <option> element. No event should be fired when we end up with the default value selected.

I discovered this while working on bug 947212. That will also fix a test that in turn relies on this fix here.

I think I'd prefer to just set the eventType here instead of introducing a flag variable, but I don't feel too strongly about it.

Yeah, that's a great idea. I should have thought of that, thanks :)
