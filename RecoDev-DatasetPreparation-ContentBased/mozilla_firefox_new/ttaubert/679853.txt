STR:

1) have two tabs
2) select the second tab
3) go into panorama
4) enter private browsing
5) go into panorama
6) leave private browsing

Expected result: Panorama is shown.
Actual result: Panorama is not shown.

This is because the PB service sets an intermediate browser state before switching to PB mode completely (see bug 476463). This issues a TabSelect event which zooms out of Panorama (possibly a regression since bug 633190).

Is this a good way to tell a reviewer what my patch does? Let's try...

This can be removed because UI._storageBusy is only a flag, not a counter anymore (since bug 662812). The SSWindowStateReady/Busy events will be fired by the setBrowserState() calls the private browsing service issues.

If we're in the middle of a private browsing mode transition we don't want to zoom into a tab.

Seems to be a good way to explain what a patch does.

there are a bunch of other conditions in there - some are self-documenting and some aren't. can you add a comment here that clearly explains the conditions for zoom in to occur?

switching from private browsing does not show panorama if it was open before



Bug 679853 - switching from private browsing does not show panorama if it was open before; r=dietrich 

Disable browser_tabview_bug679853.js in per-window PB builds since it does not make sense there, no bug
