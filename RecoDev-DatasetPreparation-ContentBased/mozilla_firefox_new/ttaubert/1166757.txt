Looked at what browser.__SS_data is still required for and it's only the tab icon and browser.userTyped{Value,Clear} that we need for when the tab is pending or has been restored. We should simply put those in the TabStateCache.

Thanks, this looks great. Since we restore it so early, I guess all that complexity with __SS_extdata was unnecessary even without the changes in this patch? Nice to see it gone.

The code after copyFromCache could use a comment explaining why we do it conditionally. It's explained in SessionStore.jsm, but someone might not have seen that when looking at this code.

Yeah, not sure when we got to that state or if it was ever needed but there it goes.
