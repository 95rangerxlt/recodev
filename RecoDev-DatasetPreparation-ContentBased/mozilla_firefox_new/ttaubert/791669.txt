After delayed startup, we should wait for a couple of seconds (like the download manager does before resuming) until we start preloading new tab pages in the background. This feature must not interfere with startup times.

r+ with nit addressed.

Thanks for fixing this. Hopefully this is the last remaining piece before we can enable the preload pref.

A hardcoded 5s timer is a bit gross, can we file a followup to use some better mechanism (perhaps dependent on bug 712478)?

Yeah I didn't like that too much either but I think we don't have a real alternative at the moment. The download panel does the same with a 10s timer to resume previous downloads. I'll file a follow-up but I'm not sure if bug 712478 can help us with that. Wouldn't we need some event/notification that tells us when user is *not* doing something? Or when the browser has finished doing the important stuff after startup?
