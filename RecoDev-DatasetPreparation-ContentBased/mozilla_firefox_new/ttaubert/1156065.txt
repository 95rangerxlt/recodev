I can't reproduce this in a clean profile with a current-ish nightly (and in particular, the code from bug 1139718 is not getting hit at all).  Are you seeing this in a clean profile?

Browser console.

Yes.

Screenshot made with 2015-04-20 with no pre-existing profile, so it's the very first start where it's loading the firstrun-page.

I can't delete this, but I can hide it from non-security-group members...

Thank you for following up!

I am also seeing this.  These messages appear hundreds of times during browsing sessions.  There seem to be 3 different files triggering this:

parent.js:279:0
SiteSpecificUserAgent.js:50:0
<unknown>
Ah, now I managed to reproduce this.  This is happening in e10s only, in the child process only, and only on hostnames that have not been visited so far, basically.

So the SiteSpecificUserAgent bit is due to this code in getUserAgentForURIAndWindow:

  let data = { uri: aURI };
  let result = cpmm.sendRpcMessage("Useragent:GetOverride", data)[0]

where aURI is an nsIURI.  So yeah, that will fail to clone correctly....

Bill, what should this code be doing instead?
It looks like the only property we use on the URI is asciiHost. So we could just send that:
  let data = { uri: { asciiHost: aURI.asciiHost } };

We don't have a generic way to send URIs over IPC. We usually just send the spec and make a new one on the other side.
Not clear what the needinfo is for. Sounds like a bug for the e10s backlog.
Needinfo was for who gets to own this.

Looks like we have no tests for this... I'd prefer to file a follow-up and leave this to :mchang.
Huh? I haven't dealt with any of this code before, what did you need?
Hmmm. I thought blame said you wrote this... Let me check again.
Looks like you did in bug 927633?

Ahh I see, thanks for finding that. Been a long time since I've seen this code.

Had to backout because of failures like this:

There is a ton of these in the log too:

JavaScript error: resource://gre/modules/UserAgentOverrides.jsm, line 92: TypeError: searchHost.indexOf is not a function

Someone should take a look at this as well... Not sure I can find time to do that in the near future, sorry.

Turns out the API is used directly when loaded in the parent (boo) and also by Fennec. I think we should leave the API intact and just re-create the URI on the other side.
