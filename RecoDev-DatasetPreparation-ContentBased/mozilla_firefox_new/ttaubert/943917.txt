This only happens for one animation frame or two. It can be perceived as flickering.

undesired hover state when closing a tab

This only happens for one animation frame or two. It can be perceived as flickering.
What's happening is that even though the tabbrowser-tab's visibility is set to hidden when closing the tab[1], the tab-background has its visibility set to visible which makes the tab background stroke appear on hover.

I think the solution here is to make our CSS in browser/themes/shared/tabs.inc.css that draws the background stroke[3] to not do this if the fadein attribute does not exist (which indicates that the tab is closing).

We should fix the code that introduced this bug, in browser/base/content/browser.css.
This is basically the same as bug 944136.

Is it? Will fixing the performance regression in bug 944136 automatically also fix the visual issue?

Yes, it should.
Yes, this will indeed be fixed by bug 944136.
