We need to leave a bottom padding (of 33px) only when a group is stacked to reserve space for the expand button. I additionally had to fix the test for bug 610208 because it saved the former tab bounds for comparison at the wrong time.

Please also update the above comment. f+ with that.

Corrected the patch because it failed to arrange tabs correctly when it wasn't stacked before. That's because .isStacked() didn't return true yet and ._stackArrange() was called with the wrong bounds. So the tabs overlapped the expand button (bizarrely on Mac only).

Shouldn't remove the "For new tab button" comment.

Hm, also feels like this should be computed, in the event the expand button is re-themed. Can you file a followup bug for that?

Re-added comment that says we currently reserve 33px of space for the expand button.
