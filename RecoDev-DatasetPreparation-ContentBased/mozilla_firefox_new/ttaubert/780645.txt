patch v1

browser_595601-restore_hidden.js currently doesn't wait for all tabs to be restored. It proceeds when a specific number of tabs is restoring.

The two tests run in separate windows but if we start the second test before tabs from the first one finished loading, we'll sometimes not get the expected number of tabs restoring at the same time.

Thus, we'll need to wait until (isRestoring == 1) because we're notified before session store. We then should only continue using executeSoon() to let session store process the progress listener notification.

would it be good to add a brief comment explaining isRestoring == 1?
