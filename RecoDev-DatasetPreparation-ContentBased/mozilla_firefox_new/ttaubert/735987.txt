When you add a site manually to the New Tab Page, you cannot remove it by clicking on the cross button on upper right corner unless you unpin it.
And if you unpin it after clicking on the cross atleast once, then it automatically gets removed on unpinning.

PS: This behavior is visible only after the New layout for NTP landed.
This happens randomly.
The STR are very complex for this bug, 
1) All the other tabs should be pinned (either manually added or pinning the already existing thumbnails)
2) This only happens to the thumbnails added manually
3) This does not start happening untill all the tiles are filled and pinned.
4) But once the above condition is satisfied, this will happen untill you close the page, even if you remove the already existing sites.

Still there might be some other STR also. This is random at times.
