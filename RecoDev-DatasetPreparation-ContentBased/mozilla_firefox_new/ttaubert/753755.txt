Turning off Thumbnails for the New Tab page should not create 'Empty Folders'

1. Add hidden pref: browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled
2. Set value to 'True' 

With Firefox closed delete the thumbnails folder in your Profile.
Browse around and check back in your Profile - a New Thumbnail Folder was created on restart of the browser as one would expect. 

What one should not expect is to find numerous 'empty folders' being created as you continue to browse over time.  

Over just a few days after clearing the Thumbnails Folder there are now 271 Empty Folders.  I fear that something could creep into the folders and would remain buried and would be very hard to locate something hidden there by perhaps a malicious program.

Enabling the Hidden Pref should turn off creating of folders.

This adds a {createPath: bool} flag to PageThumbsStorage.getFileForURL() so that we stop creating the file's path implicitly.
