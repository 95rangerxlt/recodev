window.__SS_dyingCache seems to be used to retain the state of a Window between the time it is closed and the time it is actually removed. Not only does this complicate the window objects, but I have seen leaks causes by this.

I believe that we should replace this by an appropriate use of WeakMap.

For reference, __SS_dyingCache was implemented here (no bug #):

I commented out the line setting the __SS_dyingCache property and no tests failed, of course :/
