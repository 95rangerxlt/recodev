I get this JS error in my Browser Console when a window is restored (through Session Restore).

The code in question:
    // See if the zoom pref is cached.
    let ctxt = this._loadContextFromBrowser(browser);
    let pref = this._cps2.getCachedByDomainAndName(aURI.spec, this.name, ctxt);
    if (pref) {
      this._applyPrefToZoom(pref.value, browser,
                            this._notifyOnLocationChange.bind(this));
      return;
    }

Hmm, if that's the case, and the page is in the selected tab, does it mean that the page will just have the wrong zoom (until you tab away from it and then back to it)?  Should we queue the location change and handle it after init?

Ãœbernit: the comma before the "yet" isn't necessary. :-)

I think you're right. There are multiple onLocationChange() notifications for the first tab when restoring a window but to be on the safe side we could just record the "initial location" for browsers and replay those when being initialized.

Is there any way you could iterate over the map instead of all open tabs, checking if each browser is still open?  There could be tons of tabs open, but the map should always be pretty small.

this.onLocationChange(...params, browser);

Or is FullZoom.onLocationChange called for each open tab before init?  Nevermind if so.

Hah, good call.

You're right that the map will always be small, mostly zero. I hope that iterating over all browsers shouldn't be a big perf hit as iterating the keys of a WeakMap is not possible. There is Cu.nondeterministicGetWeakMapKeys() but that should only be used for tests according to its description.
