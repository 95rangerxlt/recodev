Mockup: The change in opacity to thumbnail titles

In the current iteration of New Tab Page, the background of the thumbnails’ titles is black at 80% opacity.  On colorful and dark thumbnails, this is not very visually distracting and blends nicely into the thumbnails.  However, on mostly-white thumbnails, the 80% black bars appear create a stark horizontal stripe pattern.  By reducing the opacity on those black bars from 80% to 50%, the readability on the dark thumbnails isn’t very affected and the white thumbnails look better because there’s less of a stark contrast between the thumbnails and bars.

Asking for ux-review on this change. This patch is also included in the current UX build. Please note that this does not change the black bar at the top - this is gonna be tackled in bug 716532.

This value works for me, just make sure the close/pin on-hover use the same value 

(I know that we're changing these to not use a bar too, but in the meantime it's probably a trivial change to include?)

Fixed.

The whole page would probably be less distracting if this was black text on white with some transparency and maybe a faint border...

Sorry, have to ask for review again. The border color did not match the upper strip's new color. I removed the border completely because we don't need it.
