The "social window" (ie, the popup windows rather than the sidebar windows) should be limited to being from the same origin as the worker.  Bug 763839 asks for the status bar to be removed as showing the location of the window has "little value" - but that is only true if there is some certainty it is hosted by the provider which opened it.  Further, windows wanting a "generic" popup window is still free to use window.open to get one.

I'll take this
fixed for addon in https://github.com/mozilla/socialapi-dev/commit/4cd5018c32da2e353ca64265bf4e4e944a2c3a6a

This should as well be a part of landing the service window.

Shane, can you explain what "fixed for addon" means? Why is this being fixed in an add-on and not in Firefox where we have a swift approaching deadline?

The patch to land would come from the addon presumably, and would be ready after the frameworker hits m-c.

OK. Thanks for that info. I think frameworker just landed (on inbound?) and will make the next m-c merge? Will you port the add-on change to a patch here for review?

Yes, this change would land as part of bug 770695 which I just created (there was no bug to track landing the chat window).
In fact, I am going to resolve this as fixed as it would land as part of bug 770695

Thanks for helping me understand this, Shane. I apologize if I'm coming across as nagging. There are lots of people asking me where we're at with these features so I'm asking more questions than I normally would be. The "Eye of Sauron" is upon us :)


"service windows" should be limited to same domain as provider/worker
