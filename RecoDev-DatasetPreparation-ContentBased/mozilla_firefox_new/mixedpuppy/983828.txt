STR :
- get a social api provider that has a sidebar
- Open the Social API sidebar
- See this : http://images.devs-on.net/Image/n46QQla1tIeMpGKO-Region.png

This is because #social-sidebar-button has a min-width and min-height of 16px. While the graphic dimensions are 14*14px
Thanks.

The sidebars button looks fine to me on Windows, so I'm closing this as WFM

Still looks broken to me. I'll post a screenshot.

see attachment 8535074 if you need an asset.
It should be possible to just ensure the button's image is sized at 16x16px using the appropriate CSS.
Setting as qe-verify- since this seems to have been confirmed as fixed by bug 1087934.


Social API sidebar settings cog is blurry
