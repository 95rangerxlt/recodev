We are currently working on improving the Firefox desktop onboarding experience. This includes First Run and Update pages. Our first focus is the Australis Update experience. (see a video of our prototype, here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X54Ur_Cp0io)


A user will see our Update experience in a tab immediately after updating from the old Firefox UI to the new Australis UI. We plan on creating multiple variations of this update experience to test during Aurora and Beta (and possibly in Release) - each having a unique URL. We would like to use telemetry to track what Update experience URL a user received. This will allow us to associate all telemetry data after a user updates to Australis with the Update variation URL the user received.  

I can provide a specific URLs for the Update variations before this goes live in Aurora. Our goal is to have this ready for Aurora, but it is likely that it will be ready a couple of weeks into Aurora and not right away.
