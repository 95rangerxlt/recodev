Lets keep this to Nightly builds for now while UX works out the more precise interactions they would like to see.  This bug is intended to give us a coarse sense of the reading list feature as a sidebar.

Here is the proposed UX: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/NK1ZBQ6SY#/screens/53109574?maintainScrollPosition=false

User Stories:

High Level
As a user I'd like a simple way to save articles of interest for reading later such that I could continue reading them on another device like my phone.

User Stories Broken Down:

Add
As a user I'd like to be able to add any link to my reading list such that I can queue the page up for reading later, perhaps on another device.
* In the UX this is done via the [Add] button in the header of the sidebar, this button is unlikely to be the final interaction.

View List
As a user I'd like to view my reading list items in my browser such that I can open the link for reading or remove links from the list.
* In the UX this is done via a sidebar

Delete
As a user I'd like to be able to easily delete items from my reading list in my browser such that they are no longer shared with my other devices.
* The UX doesn't describe a way to delete items yet, lets get this from @mmaslaney

Read
As a user I'd like to be able to open up any item I previously saved in my reading list such that I can read it on my desktop.
* The UX shows this as clicking on an item and doesn't yet describe other actions like opening it in reader mode (bug 558882) or closing the sidebar automatically.  @mmaslaney will get us those details later.

Note: Reading List Service bug 1082011

This looks great ! Though I have a few questions :
- Shouldn't the reading list sidebar look be based on the history sidebar styling work (bug 989102) ?
- The thumbnail preview on the bookmarked page panel is nice, but I think it'd make a lot more sense if there was a thumbnail view in the bookmark manager as well (bug 1057370)
Breakdown, so no QE verification.
Redirecting to Blair since this is already on his list.
