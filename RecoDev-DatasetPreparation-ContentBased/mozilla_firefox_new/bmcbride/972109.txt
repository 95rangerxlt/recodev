We are planning to do another round of testing using usertesting.com just to see what Australis looks like in platforms that we don't normally use (Windows XP, vista, etc) 

We need a try build similar to the one in bug 952597 that:
* Disabled the default browser check, so it won't ask if you'd like to set Firefox as your default browser on startup.
* Install side-by-side with a normal release version of Firefox (ie, it won't overwrite it), but will use the same profile. 

Should we use Nightly or Aurora or does it make any difference?

Ok, here we go:

Used Nightly because it was easier/quicker, with no obvious downside.


Create a try build to test Australis
