Noticed this when clicking randomly. Very scientific.

When in customization mode, start dragging a widget from the panel, but then drag it back to its original position and drop it there. It'll become unwrapped, so becomes a normal toolbaritem you can interact with - instead of a toolbarpaletteitem.

Oh hey, just noticed the exception:

Error: TypeError: toolbarItem is null
Source File: resource:///modules/CustomizeMode.jsm
Line: 358

And then when attempting to drag it again:

Error: TypeError: item is null
Source File: resource:///modules/CustomizeMode.jsm
Line: 466
Latest code is throwing the following exception instead:

Error: TypeError: aNode is null
Source File: resource:///modules/CustomizeMode.jsm
Line: 307
