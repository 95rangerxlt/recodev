As usual people are advertising FF1.0.1 final is out, while it is not.
If any additional last minute patch is added the final build will be different,
but look the same.

My proposal:
In an FF window the title has |- Mozilla Firefox | appended to the pagetitle.
Change for all non-milestone builds the tiltle to |- Mozilla Firefox testbuild|
so anyone can easily recognise if he/she has the right or wrong final build.

It might be good to append the date of the nightly as well, for example:
" - Mozilla Firefox Testbuild 20050224"
In that case, for us hourly build testers the time of build (PDT/PST) would make
it perfect.
Might also be useful, though possibly a bit much to include what build it is,
currently there are builds off the 1.0.1 branch for testing as well as off the
trunk.

Also hopefully this won't get upset by extensions like Titlebar Tweaks and
FireSomething.
Generally, I feel this is a good idea.  But, if this were to be implemented, how
would it be done on Mac OS X?  It doesn't put "Mozilla Firefox" in the titlebar
of windows on OS X builds, only the page title.  It only says "Firefox" on the
application menu, and putting the date there would be very messy...
Agree with comment #1 and #2 also suggesting having a different color theme.
Should be default theme but have a grey background or some other color. 
Mass reassign of open bugs for chase@mozilla.org to build@mozilla-org.bugs.
We are using codenames now (e.g. Deer Park, Bon Echo, Minefield etc) to prevent this confusion. 


change window-title in non-final builds
