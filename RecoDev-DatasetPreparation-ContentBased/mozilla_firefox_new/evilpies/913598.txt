Did you try the two scenarios in bug 895957 comment 24? i.e. does closing a window directly will also throw this error?

And I hadn't noticed webProgress._destroy failing. Is that with the refactor in bug 913280?
Not really, I will test this. Yeah I missed _destroy in my refactoring.
So the error with the controller doesn't happen in the case where I close a whole window with remote tabs. And even in the case where I only close a tab, the controller isn't actually null or undefined, but there is still an error. Removing the call seems like the best solution.
Neil, what do you think? can we just remove the call?

Tom, btw if removing all the content you can also remove the destructor block declaration

Markh says this is causing some test failures, so let's just do it and if we need to add the removeController back we'll do it.
Please remove the whole <destructor> declaration

As far as I can tell all of this stuff should get automatically cleaned up once the <browser> is removed from the DOM and dereferenced and so you should be OK not to manually remove it.
