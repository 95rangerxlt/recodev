Most of the other shimmed objects got their own class. I think that is nicer.

removed the assignment to userTypedValue because it was buggy (already removed on larch)

just out of curiosity, are the back/forward buttons not working at all due to this, or is there something else to make it work? (I don't recall seeing in the dogfooding bugs list a mention to this)

Yes, it happens here:

We have a remote-browser binding for metrofx as well, which this change broke. We aren't actively developing on it at the moment, but we plan too next year. For changes like this it would be great if you could let us know when landing might break what we have so we can file bug against our e10s tracker.
