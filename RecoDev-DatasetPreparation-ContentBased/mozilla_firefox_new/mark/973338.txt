<!ENTITY signedInUnverified.beforename.label "">
<!ENTITY signedInUnverified.aftername.label "is not verified.">

As a general rule, concatenation is a poor design choice, variable substitution is much clearer and let localizers freely move the variable.

> signedInUnverified.label "#1 is not verified"

Since we're string frozen on Aurora, we need at least a localization comment explaining how these two strings are used.

Example

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (signedInUnverified.beforename.label,
signedInUnverified.aftername.label): these two string are used respectively
before and after the account email address. Localizers can use one of them, or
both, to better adapt this sentence to their language.

Also, how is padding managed? I would expect concatenated strings to have starting/trailing spaces.

    1.90 +                  &signedInLoginFailure.beforename.label;
    1.91 +                  <span id="fxaEmailAddress3"></span>
    1.92 +                  &signedInLoginFailure.aftername.label;

has whitespace in the XUL file. Which would be a bug, if it wasn't an email address, which is latin by all chances and thus should probably have whitespace as delimiter.

I've added the localization note.  Should we still have a bug on file to fix this in 30?
