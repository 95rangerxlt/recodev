Allow null for the profile, plus tests

Via bug 821323.  If the provider finds the user is not logged out, they can't specify |null| as the profile, but must instead specify |{}|.

Allowing null is a trivial fix and makes the api cleaner.  It's even possible we already document |null| is acceptable.  The following patch fixes this and includes tests.

Nominating for aurora as this is a trivial fix and it would be a shame to tell new providers coming on board they should work around this.

Assigning profile to profile looks like a bug at first glance, I'd probably put the null check first and avoid being too clever:

if (!profile)
  profile = {};
this.profile = profile;
Actually, this isn't a regression, right? Given the lack of multi-provider on Aurora, seems like we probably actually don't need to land this there.

Yep, fair enough - removing tracking flag for 19.
not objecting to the change, but we do already have providers developing against 17+.  Docs should get updated.

Providers can't specify 'null' for the profile info when the user is logged out.



Bug 822508 - allow social providers to specify null as the profile.  r=gavin
