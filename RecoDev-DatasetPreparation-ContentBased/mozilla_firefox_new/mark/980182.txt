Broken out from bug 956605 - this bug is to add tests to the existing about:accounts?action=* - that the correct URL is loaded.  It gives coverage for getAccountsURI/getAccountsSignInURI/promiseAccountsForceSigninURI in FxAccounts.jsm

This has much of the test changes from bug 956605.  It restructures the tests a bit (eg, no need to have a setup function as it's not shared - it keeps teardown as that is still executed even on failure).  It also makes the test e10s friendly should about:accounts ever end up in a content process.

I worry that this might fail intermittently when the order of events and messages gets messed up. Can we have a dedicated function that creates a new tab and just listens for the iframe load?
