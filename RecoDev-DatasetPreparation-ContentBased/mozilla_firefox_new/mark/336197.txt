Not much more to say.  Mac-specific, perhaps obviously.

For the non-Mac, Cmd-` is supposed to cycle through the application's windows (as with all other applications)

adding CCs
The OS implements window cycling in a handler for kEventRawKeyDown.  Our new top-level event handler swallows all events (including these) to avoid certain problems with double-processing.

I could try to fix the double-processing so that the event handler doesn't have to swallow everything (probably best), or do something else intelligent (not dropping only these specific events, or maybe something with kHICommandRotateWindowsForward).
Updated patch with a fix for this problem in bug 332579.


Cmd-` inoperative with Mark Mentovai's 1.5.0.3-plus-332579 test build
