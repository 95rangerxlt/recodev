This is a great start! Once you address these comments, you can upload a new patch and flag me for review.

As a general comment, you should use let instead of var for your variable declarations (the vars in there right now were likely written before we had let).

Also, to get a large icon to appear in the notification, you need to add our new popup to the CSS selectors here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser.css#2297, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser.css#2423, and http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/gnomestripe/browser.css#1230. Since we're including the host in each notificationID, you'll need to use a slightly different attribute selector: |.popup-notification-icon[popupid*="offline-app-requested"]|

I don't think this needs to use const - it could just use let. Also, since you don't use this until you call PopupNotifications.show, you can declare it right above there.

To follow the style of the rest of the file, you should put spaces after the commas in your argument list.

Grr, splinter review cut off what I was trying to comment on. I'm talking about these three things:

+    options.contentWindow = browser.contentWindow;
+    options.sourceURI = browser.currentURI;
+    options.eventCallback = function(aEvent) {
+    	if (aEvent != "removed")
+	    return;
+	options.contentWindow = null;
+	options.sourceURI = null;

Almost there! The CSS you added looks good, but there are a few more things you should fix in your JS changes.

Nit: space after comma.

>+    options.contentWindow = browser.contentWindow;

You can get rid of this whole chunk of code, since it's not used, and just create the options object down below with the documents property to pass to PopupNotifications.show.

Instead of setting this, I'm thinking you can do something like:

let options = {
  documents: [ aContentWindow.document ]
};
PopupNotifications.show(..., options);

(You don't need to set notification like you're doing now, since the function just returns after this call and doesn't use notification anywhere.)

Looks good! I just have two nits. Since I'm not technically a reviewer, I'm flagging Gavin to review this as well, but I think this is pretty solid. If you interested in more work, you could also file (and fix) a follow-up bug to change the other quota usage warning notification as well: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#6308.

For future reference, when you upload new versions of a patch, it's helpful to mark old versions as obsolete, and to include what you've changed in a comment with the patch.

Looking at the inter-diff between this patch and the last one, I'm confused about what you changed to fix a bug. What exactly was wrong with the last patch that you changed to make it work in this patch?

>diff -r c101c5f8c928 browser/base/content/browser.js
>+    let notification = PopupNotifications.getNotification(notificationID,browser);

Somehow, the space you added here got left out in this version.

>+      notification = PopupNotifications.show(browser, notificationID, message, 
>+					     anchorID, mainAction,

Why did you change the way the options object was declared here?

Changes in previous patch : 
 notification = Popupnotification.show();
 - Because notification.options.documents is used in callback afterwords. 

Earlier it was :
 Popupnotification.show();

This patch :
 - corrected options object.

Ah, okay, that's pretty tricky. Good catch :)

We still need Gavin to r+ this before it lands, so I'm flagging him for review again.
Gavin, I'm not sure this needs to wait for bug 588613 before landing. Any ETA on a review?

Sorry that I never got to this :(

The patch no longer applies cleanly now, but I can find someone to review this if someone is interested in updating it.

This should make the social permissions work (bug 809085) a little less painful, so here you go.

This is the original patch by :jhk with a couple of changes.  The code no longer looks for an existing notification with the same ID as this functionality is provided directly by PopupNotifications.jsm.  There are also 2 tests impacted by this and fixes for these are also included.  Single-platform try run at https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=6d468fd4ad4c

Gavin, it would be great if you could suggest a reviewer...

This patch is wrong - we do indeed need to find an existing notification as OffineApps.[dis]allowSite() must be called explicitly for each document, not just once for the domain.  I'll upload a new patch as soon as I get a green try.

updated so all documents get the correct permissions

Closer to the original patch.  Green try (for a single platform) at https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=11a625c17331
FWIW, maybe:
  let anchorID = "indexedDB-notification-icon";
should be replaced with:
  let anchorID = "webapps-notification-icon";

This impacts which icon is shown in the URL bar when the notification is "current".  OTOH though, while this feature is used regularly by "apps", it can also be used by regular web pages - so maybe the generic storage icon is indeed better?  What is an "app" again? :)
taking this bug, and now sounds like a good opportunity for a review-ping for MattN.

Reaching into the panel like that seems dirtier than the following which is similar to triggerMainCommand in browser_popupNotification.js:
panel.firstElementChild.button.click();

This image doesn't feel right to me. Could you make sure there's a bug on file to get a storage image for this and indexedDB or handle it in this one (preferred).

I updated the patch to use the existing indexeddb icon and anchor, but I'm unclear if you are also suggesting we need a bug on file to use a different image here, or that the indexeddb image should be different than the generic "question" icon, or something else?

Try for this and the patch in bug 857868 at https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=e4efb20b98ac (hopefully I'll wake up to it being all green ;)

I think both indexedDB and offline storage notifications should use a better anchor and notification icon (something which makes them more identifiable as the question mark is too generic.).  I'll leave the decision of whether they should use the same image or not up to the UI/UX folks.
