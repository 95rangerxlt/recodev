Fix v.1

I bet it adds a lot to the fun of doing a new locale, or QAing an old one, having to guess what strings are unused, or which are duplicates of others elsewhere that are actually used, or in what context an unused string might hypothetically be used in some unimagined future.

I'd like to take some of that fun away.

Fix v.1

I didn't check the strings itself, but this is a really good idea, thanks for this. Scary how much you found, too.

One question on the patch, you changed the position of historyShowSidebarCmd.label to be below the
<!-- XXX remove above if places sticks -->
comment, was that intentional?
It was: both places and placeless are using that same entity now, so "if places sticks" resolves down to nothing but a different entity name for the string "Home".
