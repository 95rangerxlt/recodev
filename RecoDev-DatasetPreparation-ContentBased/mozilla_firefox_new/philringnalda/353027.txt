Nickolay pointed out on IRC that the problem is probably this: we check to see if the button has a "feeds" attribute after it's clicked, but we don't set the "feeds" attribute if there's only one feed: http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js&rev=1.709&mark=6436-6437#6417

Everything's OK once the page finishes loading because updateFeeds is called which sets the attribute.

Fix v.1

That's it, except s/feeds/feed/ - for maximum confusion there's a .feeds on the feed-button, that's a boolean "is there one or more?", and a .feed attribute that's the href of our one-and-only if we only like one, plus the .feeds array on the browser that contains all the feed objects. One of these days, we ought to invest in better names.

Fix v.1

Hrm, relying on the menu's popupshowing handler running before the button's onclick handler is kind of weird, but OK.

>+        feedButton.setAttribute("feed",feeds[0].href);

Nit: space after comma (I can fix on checkin).
