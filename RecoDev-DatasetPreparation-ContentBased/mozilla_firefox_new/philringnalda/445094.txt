Fix v.1

This is mostly another try at the Linux half of bug 398855, which got bounced out of the tree for probably spurious reasons (since the nightly and build logs both show all these files as "possible missing or unnecessary" and thus don't have or package them, it's hard to imagine them needing them, and I'm pretty sure unit test machines don't ever do anything that would touch packages-static). To recap:

* I finally noticed that packages-static is preprocessed, so we don't have to
see the errors from non-libxul files on libxul builds, or t'other way around

* progressDlg.xpt bit the dust in bug 391870, which sent it into exile in xpfe.

* bug 392845 set the precedent to get rid of packaging for extensions that we
hate, by removing two of the three bits for xml-rpc, so I'm adding in the
missed nsDictionary.js from it, and websrvcs.xpt from bug 332174

* helperAppDlg.xpt is actually found in exthandler.xpt

* necko_jar.xpt was removed by bug 248044, re-added by aviary-landing

* search.xpt is only build for MOZ_SUITE

* platform-forms.css was removed by bug 272151

* pipnss.jar only contains a contents.rdf we don't build

* jsconsole.xpt went away in bug 243170, but it missed the unix/packages-static

* xremoteservice.xpt should have left Fx in bug 280725

* nsInterfaceInfoToIDL.js is apparently a part of websrvcs that wasn't ever
packaged on Windows, only *nix

* mozgnome.xpt moved into xpcom_system.xpt in bug 354075

New since the last time:

* even though we try to package it twice, libauth.so isn't going to come out of where LIBXUL_LIBRARY sticks it

* DOMi isn't there for Linux any more than it is for Windows

That leaves the intractable existing-profile-defaults.js, oji.xpt that I'm getting rid of in bug 445039, and the Solaris things that I'll get rid of in a separate bug, once I find someone who can tell me whether or not SOLARIS is really #ifdef there.
