When the phishing protection warning icon appears in the location bar it gets 2 px higher and apparently because of that a part of its contour vanishes, which seems to be covered by the safe browsing popup tail now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing/phish-o-rama.html
2. look at location bar


Actual Results:  
The location bar gets 2 px higher and a part of its contour vanishes, apparently covered by the safe browsing popup tail.

Expected Results:  
The location bar should stay as high as always and its contour should by displayed correctly.

This isn't perfect, but at least it's extremely minimal, and unbreaks things. The tail comes out of the right side of the icon, instead of the middle, but that still strikes me as better than changing the size of the whole addressbar.

I, uh, feel dumb.  I fixed this for the security icon last week, and forgot to check this.
