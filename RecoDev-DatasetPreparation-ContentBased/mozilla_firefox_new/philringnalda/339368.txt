If you have a live bookmark in the bookmarks menu, right-click on the entry and choose copy. The full url for the bookmark is not copied, instead only the protocol and the fully qualified domain name part of the url is copied, along with a trailing slash.

For example, for a live bookmark with feed location http://fxfeeds.mozilla.org/rss20.xml

right-clicking and copying that entry in the bookmarks menu will result in only the following being copied:

http://fxfeeds.mozilla.org/

(the protocol, the //, the fqdn, the / separator, but not the rest of the url ).

This is unlike what happens with every other kind of bookmark, where the full url is copied.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a live bookmark in the bookmarks menu
2.Right-click on it and choose 'copy'
3.

Actual Results:  
the full url for the live bookmark is not copied.

Expected Results:  
the full url should be copied.

Yes, I see that happen with live bookmarks which are made in 1.5.x.
When I copy a livemark made in 2.0 I see something different: 
jar:file:///c:/firefox/chrome/browser.jar!/content/browser/feeds/subscribe.xhtml
The livemarks keep that info also when I use them in a different browser.
Yes, I can confirm that with some bookmarks, the right-click copy action sometimes has a url:
jar:file:///C:/PROGRAM%20FILES/BON%20ECHO/chrome/browser.jar!/content/browser/feeds/subscribe.xhtml

But sometimes it will copy one live bookmark's location, as I wrote originally, with just the domain, and sometimes the javascript will be copied next time I try to copy that same bookmark's location. And sometimes, it would also result in copying exactly nothing at all!
 
So something's very wrong :( ...

I'd prefer it if copying the url would copy the location of where the feed gathers its information, as shown for 'feed location' in the bookmarks 'properties'. And be consistent :D.

It copies exactly the same thing it does for any other bookmark: the value of the href attribute in bookmarks.html. Depending on how you created the live bookmark, that might be something faked up (the http://fxfeeds.mozilla.org/ from the default livemark), the page that linked to the feed (in 1.5 or if you choose to skip the preview page), nothing (if you manually create one from the bookmarks manager), or the oopsie jar: URL for the preview page (bug 341991).

Probably the reasonable thing to do is put the feedurl in the text flavor, and skip the HTML flavor, or just do what Places apparently does, and don't put anything other than the moz/bookmarkclipboarditem on the clipboard.
Actually, no. Places is definitely wrong, and even if we actually had good site URL data, it would still be bogus to copy that rather than the feed URL.

A little scary to test right now, since bug 342116 makes it look like it has broken copy-paste as a bookmark, but several hours of testing and building and testing and building says that's broken with or without this. Branch and -disable-places only, I'll file another bug for Places.
So, since this is pointless except on the branch, branch-justification:

Risk is microscopic: in terms of things that could be done to it, FeedURL is actually closer to the URL of a normal bookmark than the URL of a livemark - it's exposed in the UI, while livemark URL just happens to you behind the scenes, and is never seen again until you copy and paste somewhere that takes text.

Why so late? I blew it: I watch bookmarks@firefox.bugs, so I must have seen comment 1, which should have made me wake up and see the rest of the bug, but I missed it.
