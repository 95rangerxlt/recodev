A little trickier than our usual "add an image, jar it up and use it, then stop using it but keep jarring it."

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/291cea9d9fca started jarring a copy of mozicon128.png as icon128.png, and used it in aboutHome.xhtml.

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/cd7d65bf8154 switched to using it from aboutHome.css

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e734b97f0420 switched from using it in aboutHome.css to using about-logo.png in aboutHome.xhtml
