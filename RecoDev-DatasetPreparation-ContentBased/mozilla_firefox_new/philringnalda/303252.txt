With the newly integrated feedview: for some reason, Feedview isn't marking up
this page. I don't have venkman installed, so I can't debug it, but it seems to
be of the form feedview wants. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps
application/rdf+xml (which is what the linked URL is served as) doesn't make the
document an instanceof XMLDocument.

This page uses <application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml> as its mime-type (used for
XUL), not the rdf-type.
No, the page doesn't serve .rdf as XUL's type: as comment 0 says, it's served as
application/rdf+xml (which is weird enough, since it's a non-RDF flavor of RSS).
But even pre-feedview, Page Info claims something served as application/rdf+xml
is XUL, which is either a clue to why feedview isn't getting them, or a bug in
Page Info.
And indeed, it's a clue: see bug 256084

bandaid for RDF/XML == XUL weirdness

Easy enough to bandaid it, while we wait on bug 256084 - genuine XUL will just
load a millisecond slower while we check the root element, in exchange for not
getting one duplicate bug filed per RSS feed served as application/rdf+xml.
