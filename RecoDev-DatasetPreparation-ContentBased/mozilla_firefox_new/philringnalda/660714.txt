Apparently back in Fx 2.0, https sites in the urlbar autocomplete dropdown had a yellow background, which was probably handy sometimes, but it's been gone since one of the bug 397723 landings in January 2008, so it's probably time to stop shipping the image that used to do it.

So the yellow background in the url bar isn't present anymore in https sites?
The background is white. This is how it should be?
