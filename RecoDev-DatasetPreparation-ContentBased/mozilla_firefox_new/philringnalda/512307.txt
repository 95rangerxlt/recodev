The date of some feeds is not displayed while the date is RFC 822.
For example, "Mon, 24 Aug 2009 19:15:00 Z" is RFC 822 compliant and is validated by feedvalidator.org, but it's not displayed when the feed is displayed whith Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Ars Technica feed given as a URL
Actual Results:  
The date is not displayed

Expected Results:  
The date yould be parsed and displayed

I get the same problem with Windows XP:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a2pre) Gecko/20090825 Namoroka/3.6a2pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) ID:20090825052618
Should I set Firefox or Toolkit as the Product ?

Perhaps excessive

This version is maybe a little over the top, but it's what I was thinking in bug 677135 comment 9 when I was thinking about using this as documentation for how to massage dates.
Created attachment 575809
Much less

Less pedantic, probably more reasonable.

The verbose approach is something you may be proud for the next 10 years, but then someone could make you sad doing a code cleanup.  Since I don't want you to be sad, I'll accept this simpler approach :p
Ah, please, just add a reference to bug 682781 in the comment.
