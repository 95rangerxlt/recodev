About a billion years ago, ARIA used namespaced attributes in every host language, and used the namespace URI http://www.w3.org/2005/07/aaa, and we had radiobuttons in the security prefpane that needed ARIA labelledby attributes.

Now, ARIA only uses namespaced attributes in host languages that insist on it, which doesn't include XUL, and uses the namespace URI http://www.w3.org/ns/wai-aria/, and we don't have any radiobuttons in the security prefpane.
