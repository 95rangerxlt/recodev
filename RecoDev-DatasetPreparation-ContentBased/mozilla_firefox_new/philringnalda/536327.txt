Apple's docs say of NSHumanReadableCopyright

NSHumanReadableCopyright (String). This key contains a string with the copyright notice for the bundle; for example, © 2008, My Company. You can load this string and display it in an About dialog box. This key can be localized by including it in your InfoPlist.strings files. This key replaces the obsolete CFBundleGetInfoString key.

which may be true in the limited worldview of someone only looking at About dialogs, if in fact CFBundleGetInfoString was at one time automatically added to default About dialogs, and if by "can load" they meant "will be loaded, or you can load it yourself if you have a custom Cocoa About dialog." NSHumanReadableCopyright is apparently automatically used in About dialogs, since Camino's string gets used without them calling it, but it is not at all the case that it replaces CFBundleGetInfoString for Get Info.

We have an NSHumanReadableCopyright in three places: in Firefox, where the CFBundleGetInfoString is what's used by Get Info and where there's no Cocoa About dialog, so the NSHumanReadableCopyright is never seen; in crashreporter.app, which has no About dialog at all, has no CFBundleGetInfoString, and thus shows nothing in the way of version or copyright info in Get Info; and in updater.app, which also has no About dialog, no CFBundleGetInfoString, and no info in Get Info.

I've now changed those to - 2007, - 2008, - 2009, and - 2010, and I think I changed the Firefox on at least once when it was UTF-16, before it moved to a UTF-8 .in, and through all those changes absolutely nobody ever once saw the strings. Time to stop.

This is fine with me but I'm really not the right reviewer for this, I am not a peer in any of those modules.

I suggest you get a review from Benjamin Smedberg or Asaf Romano.

Errm, so actually I think that analysis isn't quite right. Crash reporter and Updater do display the string if you go to the "Quick Look" option and not the "Get Info" option.

I see the version string if I Quick Look at the .app files in Thunderbird 3, but they are no longer there on trunk (and I expect the 3.0.1pre builds).
