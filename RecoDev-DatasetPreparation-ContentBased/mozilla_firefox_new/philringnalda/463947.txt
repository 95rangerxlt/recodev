At the time of bug 248970 comment 223, there was a privatebrowsing.xpt which needed to be packaged, but around bug 248970 comment 327 it moved to netwerk, so now the interface is in some necko xpt, and the only remaining trace is a "possible missing or unnecessary file: bin/components/privatebrowsing.xpt" warning in the build log, which will shortly be making nthomas grind another layer of enamel off his teeth.

Risk-free way to prevent a hapless build engineer from having to gum his food.
Oh, sorry for not catching this myself, and thanks for the patch, Phil!
Making this a blocker, doesn't need explicit approval,
Blocking on a build time warning? Beltzner must be getting soft... :)

/me avoids the temptation to leave this open as his blocker on which to add all unrelated patches to skip approval
