When the Places livemark parsing order changed back to "RDF then XML" in bug 317837, the returns at the end of TryParseAsSimpleRSS didn't change back to returning success whether or not any items were found (and for bonus fun, when items *are* found it returns NS_ERROR_FAILURE and adds the "Live Bookmark failed to load" item).

What I should have done in bug 262798: if we don't fail along the way, call it success whether or not we found items, since empty feeds are perfectly valid.

Wups, didn't check bryner's vacation realname message. Vlad, can I have your peer-stamp (if you haven't remembered why you wanted to not pick up the Empty item that Places doesn't have yet)?

Word on the street is that an r=annie.sullivan is plenty, so never mind, Vlad.

Oh, duh, RDF used to be tried after this (hence the odd-looking comments).  Probably better to test if both rss/rdf failed and only then attach a failed-to-load tag, but this is good for now.
Checked in on the trunk.
browser/components/places/src/nsBookmarksFeedHandler.cpp; new revision: 1.2;
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.

Live Bookmark success is not failure
