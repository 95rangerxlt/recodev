works fine.

I guess one of the JS check-ins must've regressed this. I don't see anything else in this window that could've caused this...

This is the error I'm seeing in the Error Console:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIPrefBranch.getComplexValue]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///home/aguthrie/downloads/2006-08-27-20-trunk/components/WebContentConverter.js :: anonymous :: line 525"  data: no]

Jeff checked in a patch that removed a try/catch block around this code on the 24th, CCing him to see if he has any thoughts on this.
Argh, the exception I mentioned in comment 2 is totally unrelated and happens at startup.
Also my sidebar (Classic Sidebars) is empty.
Local backout says it's bug 350268 exposing a trailing "}" somewhere, but so far I haven't been able to spot where.

If the "syntax error" report added by the fix for bug 350268 is being dropped, please file another bug; it should be in the JS console (error console, whatever), at least.

Found it (the error, not what's hiding the error message, which oddly enough came through while I was trying to debug), testing the patch...

Break the tree binding, it's amazing how many things explode.

So - bug 350268 is not landing on the branch.  Do we want to take these type of cleanups there anyway?

I think so, and I've nominated other patches for approval, as Phil did in this bug.  The trailing extra braces are only bugs, they can be safely removed.  If we leave them, we'll have to keep track of all the dependent bugs and land all the patches if we ever land the fix for bug 350268.

Even if we never take the patch for bug 350268, I think we're better off taking these safe dependent fixes.  I think we have the group bandwidth to get these in without serializing and slowing down Firefox 2 work -- but of course, it's not totally free, and I'm taking time here myself that's needed elsewhere.

mozilla/toolkit/content/widgets/tree.xml 	1.21.2.8
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
