While we wait for bug 442399 to put LiveConnect out of its misery entirely, we're spewing "Possible missing or unnecessary..." errors in the build logs, trying to package oji.xpt whether or not MOZ_OJI is defined.

oji.xpt isn't there despite http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/modules/oji/Makefile.in#47 making it look like it would be because http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/modules/Makefile.in#72 doesn't let you get that far without MOZ_OJI. That's bogus, but there's a limit to how much fiddling with corpses I'm willing to do.

Only package oji.xpt if it's likely to be there
