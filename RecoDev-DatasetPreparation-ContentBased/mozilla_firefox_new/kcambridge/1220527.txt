If users click on the Upgraded Notifications message too early (before the browser window opens), the click is lost.  The message disappears on click, but the browser never opens a tab to the push learn more link.
Looking at how to implement this: should we use `Services.ww.openWindow` to open a new browser window if we don't have a most-recent window?
I think we can just move the code to run at first window restore (see _onFirstWindowLoaded).

I thought there was a helper to fallback to opening a new window but I can't find it.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 1216271
[User impact if declined]: If startup is slow, clicking on the notification won't do anything despite the text saying "Click to learn more".
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: No automated test change since it's for a one-time notification. There is a test for the initial notification behaviour.
[Risks and why]:  Low risk one-time migration change
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

This seems to be a regression we should fix, let's uplift to Aurora44.
