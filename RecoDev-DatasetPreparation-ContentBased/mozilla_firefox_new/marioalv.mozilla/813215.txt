This test is currently failing on Birch, and it's one of the blockers of getting Birch tests green.

Patch to migrate the test to the new per window private mode

Hi.
This patch is a Work In Progress patch. I don't have a Windows environment to test the Windows part of the patch, so our idea is to run the patch on the try server and see if everything works OK.

As the test comments state:
" * @note Mac only tests the new notifications, as restoring the last window is
 * not enabled on that platform (platform shim; the application is kept running
 * although there are no windows left)"

we can not test the Windows part on a Mac because there's no way to open/close/open the mochitest browser on a Mac, and this a is necessary step to do on this test.

Have you tested this on the try server yet?  If yes, please provide a link to the results.  I'd like to review a patch which has been fully tested, if possible, but this looks good so far.  Also, I think you should be able to use Linux as a non-Mac platform here so you shouldn't need access to a Windows machine.
Hi.
Yes, we tested on the try server.
