Any updates here Drew?
I just started looking at this late on Friday.

I think there are a couple of ways to go.  Right now the about:home/newtab suggestions popup is this one-off HTML implementation, while the main chrome search bar's popup is... implemented in XUL or something, I don't know -- that's part of what I'm learning for this bug.

We could convert the about:home/newtab popup to be "native" like the main search bar's.  Ideally that's how it would have been implemented to begin with.  Otherwise we have to maintain these two different suggestion implementations with interactions and styles that emulate each other.  If we don't do it now for this bug we should do it at some point -- if it's even possible, since about:home/newtab's popup is in content while the main search bar's popup is in chrome.

If we don't convert the about:home/newtab popup to be native for this bug, then this becomes two breakdown bugs, one for each type of popup.
I'm not sure what you mean by »convert to native«, but we're also currently trying to make about:newtab unprivileged (bug 776477), because not being able to use the back button to get to your tiles isn't great.

Would those two efforts interfere?

I don't think so.
