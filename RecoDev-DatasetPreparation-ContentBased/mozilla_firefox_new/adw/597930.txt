Since the move of the link hover data from the status bar to the location bar, it does not appear that JavaScript URLs are handled properly.

For example, this code:
<a href="javascript:popup('http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#177','points',550,650)" class="contentLinkBold">Points<br>Generated</a>

Shows this in the location bar:
http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#177','points',550,650)

Notice how the parsing of the href starts at the "http://", instead of the "javascript:", but then swallows up the rest of the JavaScript code, too.

The regexp used to parse the URL is busted.  This is embarrassing.

Thanks for filing the bug.
We could probably write a simple little test for this so we don't regress it in the future, right?

Had to back out because I can't land a bug without causing orange.

Landed again last night, no orange in nearly 24 hours, calling fixed.

http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tree-management/browse_thread/thread/9f281275d565657c# says this may have caused substantial memory use regressions on OS X 10.5.
Thanks Kyle.  There's no way this bug caused that regression, so I'll comment at the other bug in the push, bug 597338, which is the likelier candidate.  (But I don't think it regressed either.)
