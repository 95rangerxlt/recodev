hi marc,   any idea when an update might be ready for firefox 3?  we are trying to get as many extensions out with the next two betas as possilibe to increase both the testing of the extension and of firefox.
marc, just checking to see if there is any progress.
Working on it? Will be released soon.
Marc, just checking in again. 3.0.* is on AMO now, so you'll only have to update once!
Shouldn't this have been marked as resolved?
The current version of All-in-One Gestures seems to support Firefox 3.6.  Resolving this bug.
