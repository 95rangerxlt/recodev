Currently sync links are actually buttons, to conform with browser.js click listener code. Replace buttons with actual links and propagate to browser.js.

Do you really need to override the default <a> styling at all? I could see perhaps the color change being desirable, but the :hover text-decoration and cursor rules seem like they should be unnecessary. r=me with that addressed.

v2: removed underline css

Underline does seem unnecessary, but the cursor doesn't appear for me without explicitly adding it in the css, not sure why.

Does the hover stuff work if you make the links have href="#"?
No, href="#" still lacks hover cursor.
