Hi Gregory, can you mark this bug as [qa+] or [qa-] for verification.
I found a minor issue while testing this. Should have a one-line patch soon...
Upon further investigation, it was a bug in my testing methodology. Sorry for the bugspam.
Gregory where can I find the updated hotfix addon? I've tried testing using the staging server but I received an internal server error:

The updated hotfix isn't yet ready to be tested. I'll let you know when it is, don't worry.
Setting as qe-verify- since 32.0.3 was already deployed.
