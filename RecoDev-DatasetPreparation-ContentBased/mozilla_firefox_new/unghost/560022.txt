Should not be landed on 1.9.2 until 3.6.4 is shipped (see Bug 474226 comment 13)

This looks good for mozilla-central.

Gotta sync with release-drivers on the 1.9.2 patch.

Any news on 1.9.2 approval? I'd like to land it for Firefox 3.6.8, if possible.

Now that 4.0 is out of the door and successful, I don't see a need for this to go on 3.6 still, canceling the review request.
