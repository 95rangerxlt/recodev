some widgets, like close button in "no updates found" info have non-gtk focus drawn, which look odd and very out-of-place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. you must have no update for extensions :> .
2. click "find updates".
3. click close button on info, without getting mouse button up and that button (to prevent closing info message).
Actual Results:  
close button has additional focus.

Expected Results:  
everything ok (with firefox it's a wish for christmas...).

remove redundant drawing of focus 

This part of code was added with bug 281932, but it is not needed for GTK toolbar buttons (a double focus ring is also painted for print preview toolbar buttons in Firefox 2). 

With this patch the buttons in the print preview toolbar remain accessible with the keyboard and focus is being drawn (natively).
ping
Extra focus rings look really bad. :(
Ryan, do you have cycles to review this if Mano is too busy?
Reed, did you posted comment #4 in good bug?

The comment was meant for this bug, yes.

Hmmm, close buttons in "No updates find" tip in addons manager also have double focus indicator (GTK's and Firefox').

@Paul: ugly dotted focus on tabs labels still remain.
