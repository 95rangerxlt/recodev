The "Unicode" language group was renamed to "Other Languages" in bug 280007. But
the new Options window reverts to calling it "Unicode".

This is seen in Tools -> Option -> Contents, click on the "Advanced" button, and
open the "Fonts for:" dropdown.

Change to "Other Languages" in fonts.dtd

Hmm, Steffen -- should the charset.dtd and charsetOverlay.dtd  files be changed
as well?
I can only review Help stuff. Please ask a Firefox peer
(http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html#Browser).

And please attach a patch (cvs diff -u8
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/fonts.dtd > patch.diff)
instead of the complete file.

Thanks for catching it.

Please, make a diff and write to Ben directly (he doesn't read bug mail) to ask
for review.

Ben fixed it.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
