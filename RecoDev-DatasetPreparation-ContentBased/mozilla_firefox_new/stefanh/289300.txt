Offshoot from bug 210204.

When displaying XUL menus on Firefox/Mac, the menu items appear one after the
other, with no padding between them.  The same XUL menu appears fine on Mozilla,
and on Firefox with other themes.  So the Pinstripe theme needs to be updated.

I added the following code to mozilla/toolkit/themes/pinstripe/global/menu.css,
and it seemed to fix the problem:

+/* ::::: menu/menuitems in menubar ::::: */
+
+menubar > menu {
+  border: 1px solid transparent;
+  padding: 2px 5px 2px 7px;
+  margin: 1px 0px 1px 0px;
+}

This seems to fix the padding issue.  The menu doesn't fit in with the theme,
though.  The menu items are drawn using the system theme, and there is a
noticeable difference between the XUL menu and the rest of the toolbar (i.e.
load http://www.mozilla.org/docs/tutorials/sitenav/4.xul in a nightly from April
6 or later).

This is a firefox theme bug, not toolkit/widgets, Kevin would need to come up
with nice css rules :)

Add some native styling to xul menubars/menus

This will make xul menubars look more "native" (basically putting back stuff from classic). I also ported some stuff from the patch in bug 301105 in order to make the behaviour of the menubar be more "native".
Another testcase here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=194850. Note that left/right ends (borders) of the menubar look a bit washed-out.
Fixed by the patch in bug 342515.


XUL menus appear compacted on Firefox/Mac
