The 'adavanced' preferences pane ui is cut on mac, this is a pretty new

Assigning to Kevin.

I think it's because the patch in bug 302359 put all four certificate buttons on

Homemade build, 5 minutes old, based on CVS up to date at midnight today,

fredbezies@gmail.com, that's bug 305288.
sorry, i did not notice this bug before :(
This bug now effects the text at the bottom of the Privacy part of the
preferences pane. However the effect is only found when going from General to

If any other section of the pane has previously been selected prior to opening
the preferences, the text at the bottom of the pane ('The Clear private data
tool can be used to erase your private data using a ....) appears normally.

Gecko/20050822.
Closing this up again and splitting Gary's new issue off into a separate bug
(bug 305626).
