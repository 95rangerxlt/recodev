The "Import Settings and Data" dialog shows up on first run when there is no profile, with the following content:
"o Don't import anything
No programs that contain bookmarks, history or password data could be found."

I noticed this on 14.0b6, but traced it with nightlies:
This is the last one that does *not* do it:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2012-05-31-04-20-08-mozilla-aurora/firefox-14.0a2.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2

I presume this happens on all platforms, but I only witnessed it on Linux x86-64.

"Bring back" the migrators generator

In the Original Patch I introduced this migrators-generator in order to both handle the issue raised here and generate the wizard radio buttons dynamically. Later on, as part of the diet, I fall back to building the wizard contents "statically", so I removed the generator I've introduced, not considering that it had this other purpose...

This bring back the generator, and, for now, it's used only for determining if there's any migrator available. Of course, it's platform-specific behavior isn't necessary *yet*, but it cannot hurt anyone. I'll use this new functionality on trunk sometime soon.

"Bring back" the migrators generator

Review of attachment 632930:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

So basically this happens only on Linux when chrome is not installed, or another platform where we don't support any browser source. OSX and Win always have a default browser we import from.

We will need some QA on this.

Btw, if I read this correctly, if there is no default browser set, but there's a supported browser installed, we proceed passing null migrator and empty string migratorKey, so that the dialog just selects the first source available.

Probably on trunk, once we can get migratorKey from the migrator itself, we may remove the previous else and just use this to set migrator and migratorKey, since migrators has default browser as the first one.  Though for aurora/beta this is fine.

Linux is the only expected case, right, but, in theory, this could also apply to OS X (If you never open Safari and copy Fx from a disk image). Indeed it cannot happen on Windows, because the IE migrator doesn't know saying no.

Indeed, that's the plan for trunk.

"Bring back" the migrators generator

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #):  bug 748569
User impact if declined:
1) Linux: If chrome is not installed, a useless (though functional) wizard will show up in the first startup.
2) Mac: If Firefox is started in a user account on which Safari was never opened, the same issue would raise.
3) Windows: not an issue.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): there are no automated tests for migration.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): In theory, If I did something *very* wrong, the migration wizard wouldn't show up when it should be.
Possible backout is very easy as the patch only touches the MigrationUtils module.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none

Sounds like a low risk fix for the most part. Let's land before our next beta on Tuesday.
