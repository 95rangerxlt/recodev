Confirmed on  Gecko/20031220
This behavior is reproducible on two macs (both w/ all 10.3.2 and all updates
current and latest nightly builds))....


((I have noticed it previously, and thought this behavior may tie in with Bug
227525 - but it is an uneducated guess...))

This happens for me on OS X.

At this point, the window list seems to be empty and there are
no visible windows.  But using Panther's Expose function, hit F10.
a small window appears in the upper right hand corner.
I believe that this mystery window is the culprit.

I suspect that this bug is also responsible for not being able
to open a new browser window from the Mozilla icon in the dock
in the same situation of Mozilla running with no open windows.

Note that if you open the Manage Bookmarks dialog and
double click on a selection, it does open a new window for it.
In fact, this works correctly.  It does correctly opens a new window
and also creates a new one if there is no current window.
Confirming. Comment 3 is referring to Bug 223779, although I believe it's
unrelated to this one.

i am able to re produce this on two macs, both running 10.3.4 and firefox 0.9.3

nothing hapens at all when you select a bookmark with no firefox window open.
I can verify that this also happens in 1.0 PR on OS X 10.3.5.

I can also confirm on Firefox 1.0RC1.  It should also be noted that other Mac
browsers, including Camino, Safari, and IE will open a new window with the
selected bookmark if you choose one from the bookmarks menu when there is no
window open.  This is something that should be fixed because Firefox doesn't
behave the way that other Mac applications do in this scenario.

Also, in reply to comment #3, the hidden window is necessary to keep Firefox
running even when all other windows are closed.  That window owns the menubar
when no other windows are opened, so the fix for this bug will probably have
something to do with making that window launch a new window with the selected
bookmark.
This could be considered a major functionality issue for Mac users, since it is
common to leave an app running without any windows open, and then choose
something from the menu and expect it to happen.  If the bookmarks menu is
there, then it is reasonable to expect that when you click a bookmark, it will
open.  So either this should be fixed, or the menu should be removed when there
are no windows open (until it is fixed).  Obviously it would be better if it was
fixed.

Since there is no longer a separate 1.0 release for Mac, I'm nominating this to
block aviary 1.0.  This should really be fixed, one way or another, before being
released, so that it is not viewed as sloppy.
It should be noted that this bug does not exist is Mozilla 1.7.3 (in other
words, Mozilla will open the bookmark you select from the Bookmarks menu if
there are no windows open).

In fact, it seems that this issue was fixed in Seamonkey 5 years ago as bug
14912.  That bug seems to confirm that it is some sort of problem with the
hidden window.  Perhaps some sort of simple patch porting can be done?

> too late for 1.0

Since this bug was considered too late for 1.0, can we expect it to be addressed
in the next update 1.1?  Please advise.
yes, i have the same peorblem: OS X 10.6 firefox build 1.0RC1

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050117
Firefox/1.0+

MacOSX 10.3.7

Still a problem after 14 months. 
here's what hapeens: hiddenWindow.xul doesn't fire Startup() onload which fires
the delayedStartup() function; result: bookmarks service isn't initialized.

Now, we shouldn't call either startup() or delayed startup, most of their
content isn't relevant for the hiddenWindow.
-> me, 1.1

sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


If I have no window open and select a bookmark from the pull-down bookmark menu, nothing happens.
