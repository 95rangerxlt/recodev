(Oops, submitted early):

* Install .js into resource://gre/modules/devtools/ with directory intact, for example: resource://gre/modules/devtools/server/actors/script.js

* A few "make sure errors are printed on the console" fixes snuck in to the patch.

A build with the patch applied gives me this when entering "tools srcdir /foo/bar":

While we're at it, could dbg-client.jsm become client/debugger.jsm, or client/dbg.jsm, or something less repetitive?

This looks great, but as I reviewed it, something did occur to me that we perhaps ought to think about:

I'm not sure gathering the actors together in their own directory really makes sense. The protocol is designed to let different tools use it independently, so having allthe tools' actors in one place hopefully isn't as valuable as having each actor in the same directory with its related code. So, for example, the console actor should be with the other console stuff. One could still remove redundancy:

devtools
- dbg-server.jsm
- main.js
- transport.js
- webconsole
  - actors.js
  - WebConsoleUtils.jsm
- dbg
  - client.jsm
  - root-actor.js
  - browser-actors.js
  - script-actors.js
- styleeditor-actors.js

Things like styleeditor that are currently simple can be top-level files for now, and become directories if they grow.

I misread this. Sorry. It's completely fine...
