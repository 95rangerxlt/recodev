The same feature implemented in Chrome.

e.g. Inspecting the following div in the rule view:

<div id="id"></div>

With the following css:
#id, .someselector {
  font-weight: bold;
}

#id would be in bold because it matches the node. We could also use specificity rules to determine which selector is actually applied.
