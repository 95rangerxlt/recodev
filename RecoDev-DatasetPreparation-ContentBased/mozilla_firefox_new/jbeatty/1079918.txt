We are ending builds for the Swahili and Zulu localizations of Firefox. The teams have not been participating in the project for a very long time and we have been unable to find new localizers to consistantly maintain the localization. 

Localizers have been made aware of the change, and we'll add a snippet to users of the currently available localized builds recommending that they migrate to en-US or fr.

This patch will need to be committed after the previous patch for this bug.
These changesets apply to all m-a, m-b, and m-r, but the change can ride the train, making 33 the last release build for each of these locales.

I take it this means that the change needs to land on m-c. Is that correct?

No, land on mozilla-aurora and then ride the trains from there.
mozilla-central has a very small set of locales, so these were already excluded.
Dashboard is updated, too.
