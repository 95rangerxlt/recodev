When you build with --enable-chrome-format=flat, feeds subscription dialog is broken due to FileWriter._isValidWindow function checking that the real URL of the page called into it starts with "jar:file://", which is obviously not true for a app built with flat chrome.

I'm going to change that check to a more restrictive, but at the same time more correct: check that the real URI of the page equals the resolved URI returned by the chrome registry for the subscription page (chrome://browser/content/feeds/subscribe.xhtml)

Please use Cc and Ci and the indentation style used elsewhere in this file.

If you can do that, and attach a new patch I'll check it in. This looks good. We might want to get this for b2 too if we can (since I think your approach is superior to mine).
