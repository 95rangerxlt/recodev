I think we hit this in all debug builds. I see it in my startup-spew of my local debug build -- it's the ~10th line of output on my system (intermixed with some "++DOMWINDOW" lines).

Hi Daniel,
Add SocialStatus to the let list at the top of browser-social.js (it needs to be global due to the button oncommand).  r=me with that.

Gotcha. Thanks for the r+!  inbound is currently closed, so I'm posting the updated patch as checkin-needed.
Inbound's open again, so I landed:
