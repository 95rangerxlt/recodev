Intercept clicks in about:newtab

With our e10s setup, the about:newtab page is loaded in the parent process. When a user clicks on one of the thumbnails, that navigation happens directly through the page (because it uses simple <a> links), and that means the page is also opened in the parent.

What this patch does is to prevent the direct navigation (only when e10s is enabled) and instructs the browser to load the target URL in the current tab, which will make it properly take the path to call _updateBrowserRemoteness()

Long term we will probably need to have a channel listener to stop the load in the parent and automatically start it again as remote, but we're not there yet. So that's why I've named this function with "E10s" to remind it should be gone in the future.

We have plans and patches to make about:newtab unprivileged and e10s friendly as well. They're currently blocked by prioritization and failing tests, unfortunately. We should definitely push in that direction for about:newtab but I'm guessing you need that mechanism for other chrome pages anyway.
