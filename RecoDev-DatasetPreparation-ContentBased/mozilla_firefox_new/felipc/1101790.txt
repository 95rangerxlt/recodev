We want the UITour page to be able to do something like:

setTreatmentTag(name, value);
var tag = getTreatmentTag(name);

So that we can later determine which version of the tour the user saw, and have that influence behavior going forward.

The setTreatmentTag function should record the arbitrary key value pair in prefs (e.g. in a browser.uitour.treatmenttag.<name> = value), and should also be recorded in FHR (not sure how to do that exactly).

Benjamin, can you comment on the "FHR stuff" that's needed here?
Here's what I think we want:

When the tour calls setTreatmentTag(name, value) we record the following in the current FHR "day":

org.mozilla.uitour.treatment: {
  "_v": 1,
  "<name>": "<value>"
},

That way the treatment will expire in FHR 180 days after setting.

FHR Provider for UITour

My understanding is that FIELD_DAILY_DISCRETE_TEXT is the proper field type for this measurement.

Also, there's nothing to block that multiple calls to the same tag be done in the same day, so the <value> ends up as an array of strings instead of just a string. E.g.:

org.mozilla.uitour.treatment: {
  "_v": 1,
  "<name>": ["<value 1>", "<value 2>"]
}


Benjamin: it looks like I don't need to explicitly add the manifest file to package-manifest.in because there's a * for the modules folder here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/installer/package-manifest.in#616
Is that correct?

FHR Provider for UITour

Needed to add a `delete window.UITourMetricsProvider` to head.js as the browser_UITour.js tests import UITour.jsm and report a leak if this is not cleaned up
I think you are correct about packaging; a try build would confirm.

Replaced the "Do some FHR stuff" line from gavin's WIP patch with the call to the FHR provider. Changing to review

I just tested a packaged version locally and it worked fine

I never reviewed UITour code before but this looks really straightforward, and there's a simple test. So I'm setting r+ to land. I'll leave the request for Dolske in case he wants to look at it further and I can follow-up with changes

I probably would have pondered using more descriptive like setFHRTreatmentTag, but meh.

What would be the interpretation of multiple treatment values? Would users be able to switch treatments?
In the cases we're designing for right now, that would be unusual, although it might be possible if the user reloaded the whatsnew page multiple times and we didn't check for that.
Has there been a decision on what the identifiers will look like for <name> and <value>?
The specifics of the search tour data is tracked in bug 1102610. There's a spreadsheet linked from there.

Ah ok, so we should generally be seeing two keys in the FHR payload, "srch-chg-treatment" and "srch-chg-action".
