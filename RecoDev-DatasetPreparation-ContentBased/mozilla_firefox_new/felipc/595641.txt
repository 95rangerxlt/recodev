Double right-clicking on the title bar randomly performs actions (focusing areas, opening the bookmark sidebar, etc.)  No errors in the error console.

Just tried it with Accelerated Layers off, the bug is still there.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:2.0b5) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b5

With menu bar disabled - for me I get the following: double right clicking in various locations to the right of the orange Firefox button refreshes page, opens the sidebar, closes the sidebar, highlights text in the searchbar, opens home page in current tab.

Windows Vista, Service Pack 2, 64-bit
Jimm, can you reproduce this and diagnose? Or Felipe?

WM_NCRBUTTONDBLCLK falls through WM_APPCOMMAND

This was a problem in the native event processing so a mochitest won't be able to cover it. Maybe we could include a litmus test. (although I don't think it's necessary as it'd be hard to regress this, and the bug is not 100% reproducible -- depends on the X/Y position of the click)

That kinda sucks. Is there no way to send a native mouse event to the titlebar and synthesize the right-click?

It's these type of hard to notice, corner cases that need to be auto-guarded IMHO.
