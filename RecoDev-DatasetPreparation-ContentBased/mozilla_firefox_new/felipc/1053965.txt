Activation should work after bug 915547 lands, however about:home has larger issues, other tests are disabled in browser/base/content/test/general/browser.ini
So I think I need some more context for this bug. Shane - can you tell me how I can reproduce / recognize this bug? What does it mean to "activate from about:home"?
see browser/base/content/test/social/browser_aboutHome_activation.js and bug 1029942

as well, in browser.ini

[browser_aboutHome_activation.js]
skip-if = e10s # Bug 1053965 "cw.ensureSnippetsMapThen is not a function", also see general/browser.ini about:home comments


So it may be a general issue with snippets, a general issue with about:home, or possibly something with socialapi (though iirc activation in e10s works)
I don't think this should block the uplift (and hold) on Aurora. Like, we should definitely fix this, but I suspect we can live with this on Aurora for a little while. Re-nomming.

Fix browser_aboutHome_activation.js

So it turns out the feature is working properly, it was just the test that didn't work with e10s. I had to refactor the test to make some parts of it to run in the content process. I did this using the ContentTask.spawn function which helps a lot by running a function defined in the test, in a framescript, and returns a promise that resolves when the function resolves in the content process.

I'm trying my luck at dropping the aSnippetsMap.delete("snippets") clean-up hoping it's not necessary, because doing so will be slightly inconvenient.

Test passed (the failure on treeherder is unrelated, from another patch in my queue that I forgot to remove)

Shane, since Felipe is away, could you please give me some information(s) on how to reliably verify this fix? With older & latest builds, I can see that 'Share this page' button is not available on about:pages and the already enabled social providers (Goal.com, Cliqz, Delicious and so on) are successfully visible in the sidebar, one by one. Thanks in advance!
Alexandra, This is a unit test fix, you don't need to do anything here.
