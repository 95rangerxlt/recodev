Patch v.1

[Triage Comment]

Required for 38.0.5 Pocket launch.
I'm not sure removing these strings is the best option from the l10n perspective. I also don't see why we'd need to clean this up on 38.0.5. 

Jeff - Will this cause any problems for l10n?
This shouldn't have an impact on l10n.

Do we have a bug on file to move these strings into l10n proper already? It'd be good to know that so that we know what we'll be doing at that point.
