Patch v.1

The doorhanger that notifies the user when DRM is being used should contain a "Learn More" link. The current experience is that the doorhanger says "Some audio or video on this site uses DRM software, which may limit what Firefox can let you do with it.", with a "Configure…" button that takes you to the Preferences page, which has a checkbox to enable/disable DRM and a Learn More link. But the doorhanger itself does not have a Learn More link.

The original UX specs included this. Looks like we just overlooked it when implementing bug 1111148, and it wasn't caught until just now. :-(

The fix is trivial.

I like how our codebase has different capitalization versions of this property, because... yeah!

Patch v.1

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: Missing "Learn More" link (See release-drivers discussion)
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: n/a
[Risks and why]: basically zero, the URL is already used elsewhere, and we're just using a standard PopupNotifications API to add the link to the panel (other panels already do this with their own links).
[String/UUID change made/needed]: There are NO string changes.

s/beta/release/, again, since this should at least be included in 38.0.5.
