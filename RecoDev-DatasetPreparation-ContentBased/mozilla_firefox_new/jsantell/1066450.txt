Only in Fx35.0a1 (9/5/2014), not found in Fx34.0a1. Navigating to a page does not restart the WAE panel.

Recreation:
* Go to a page with audio [1] and load the WAE tools
* Navigate to a new page [2] with the tools still open
* Just waits on "Waiting for audio context to be created", can't refresh to get out of it without closing/reopening toolbox

This was introduced via bug 1053805
Pinging Victor, should check out shader/canvas editors to see if bug 1053805 caused similar weirdness with those tools

Reloading results in global X+1 being created, followed by global X being destroyed -- as call watcher's onGlobalDestroyed event occurs after the creation of the new global, the window matching in onGlobalDestroyed that pauses recording is never called in this case.

However, when navigating to a new page, global X is first destroyed, thus pausing recording, and then global X+1 is created with call watcher's `_recording` being off.

This fixes web audio, and we can roll a fix into call watcher itself if there are issues with shader/canvas editor.

I've actually seen this happening a few times in the canvas tools too!

Canihaz dis for canvas.js?
Checking this in, opened bug 1070225 for canvas editor to apply a similar patch, will take care of that
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/4d9e5795ee82
seems some failures were related to this changeset too like https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=48568065&tree=Fx-Team so i had to backout this too
What are the other failures? I can't imagine a change in a dev tool panel causing plugin failures within the browser..
Note to self, fix tests to pass with ES6 lexical temporal dead zone[1]
