More in line with enable-allocations or enable-framerate, rather than a toggleable option, like flattening recursion. This'll save us in the future from not collecting opt data when it's not requested, not processing it, and the JIT panel will be moving away from the call tree anyway, so it won't be intrusive if enabling JIT opts anyway.

withJitOptimizations would be more specific.

you really don't need this assertion lol
Changed to withJITOptimizations

[JIT View] "enable JIT optimizations" should be a recording feature



Bug 1175705 - Make enable-jit-optimizations a recording-feature rather than a toggleable display feature. r=vp
