The getSetting code is not correct for working in the child process.  We should use a try / catch as a quick fix and file a follow up to make it work for real.

Review of attachment 8662544:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To be nice to other callers of `getSetting`, also add a try / catch inside that method that rejects its promise in case of error.

The failure is currently on the `let settingsService = Cc["@mozilla.org/settingsService;1"].getService(Ci.nsISettingsService);` line, so we get inside the current if.

You'll still need the try you already added, since the promise will be rejected.

Not aware of a good way to test this today, unfortunately.
