permissions for standalone chat

Standalone chat windows added in bug 880911 need to support permission panels.  bug 809085 adds general support for permissions in social panels.  

The patch here makes it possible to show panels for new permission requests.  

Bug 883326 would need to be fixed to transfer existing permission panels when you swap the chat window out of a tabbed browser window, but can be handled as a followup.
