Add some more gtk headers

Ted, are we including all these files explicitly? Is there a meta-header we could use instead (gtk/gtk.h), to avoid having to make this list larger and larget and less manageable?

gtk/gtk.h is already in the list.
We are, in fact, and they've been in there for quite some time:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=/mozilla/toolkit/crashreporter/client
/crashreporter_linux.cpp&rev=1.9&mark=53-68#53

I don't really know anything about GTK, so I can't comment as to whether we could just include one meta-header.

You can certainly just include <gtk/gtk.h> instead of all the files individually. I don't see a rationale for not doing that.

As for them being in there for a while, this worked fine with gcc 4.1, but with gcc 4.2 the build failed due to missing symbols.
Would you care to provide a patch to replace all those includes with that one include?  I don't have gcc 4.2 here, so I can't verify that it works properly.

Include meta gtk header

With this change (and without the system-header change), I can successfully build with gcc 4.2/

Include meta gtk header

r=me

Requesting approval1.9, this change should be a no-op, but it fixes a system-headers issue for gcc 4.2 in a clean way.
