Not sure, I got this message in the error console and it just sounded bad and I haven't seen it previously:

That's an odd exception - the progressListener object we set as the progress listener on nsExternalHelperAppService certainly does have an onStateChange method.
I've found the real problem:

But I haven't figured out why the error message is so misleading...

Very simple, zero-risk patch to keep the error console clean whenever downloading a file.

I know why now, and sadly there's almost nothing we can do about it. See bug 428590.

I'm seeing this error in the console still with the latest 3.0pre build.  The error occurs when typing in an autocomplete textbox in my extension.

Error: [Exception... "'JavaScript component does not have a method named: "getImageAt"' when calling method: [nsIAutoCompleteResult::getImageAt]"  nsresult: "0x80570030 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JSOBJECT_HAS_NO_FUNCTION_NAMED)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: no]

Extension Testcase for Bug 428557.  Toolbar w/autocomplete field

After installing start typing "12345" into textbox to see the error console flood with errors.
Appears that the error was due to an update of the nsSearchSuggestions.js script not a regression.  Misleading error didn't help me figure that out.
