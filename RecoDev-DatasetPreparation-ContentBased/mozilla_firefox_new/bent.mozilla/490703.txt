Patch (-w version)

This is a complicated leak but maybe not that uncommon. Basically the feed handler in browser.js keeps an array of HTML link elements around to determine what to do with the feed button in the URL bar. These link elements reference the window that they came from and hold those windows alive even after those windows may have been closed. Simply substituting the actual link elements with the href/title inside the array allows the windows to be collected.

Patch

Can you avoid changing the addFeed signature and just copy the properties inside that function? Helps avoid unnecessary addon breakage if they're using that function.

r=me with that.
See also bug 489520, fwiw. That bug's patch solved most cases where this caused a problem, I think, but taking this patch certainly wouldn't hurt.
Hm. Actually, I have a tree that is older than dbaron's fix in bug 489520 and it looks like we solved the same bug from two different angles. Do you still want this fix?
Yeah, I think we should still take it (with nit in comment 2 addressed). It cleans up the code a bit and avoids holding on to objects we don't need to hold on to.

Patch with nits addressed

Reverted function signature.
Not blocking as per comment 4, probably don't want to risk it on branch, but go go for trunk!
