Steps to reproduce:

Make sure e10s is on and that DPI scaling is active (I have mine on 150%). Drag a tab around.


Actual results:

The distance between the mouse pointer and the tab preview increases as the mouse is moved to the right.


Expected results:

The distance between the mouse cursor and the tab preview should be constant.
