@Tim, Could you suggest some tests that I need to run for this fix.

Thanks for your patch, Saurabh! That's the right place for this but we need to add an observer that calls update() when entering or leaving private browsing mode so that the value is updated. There are no existing tests that would cover this behavior, we would need to add a new one.

No need to do this. utilityOverlay.js runs in the chrome window.

I will soon attach the test also in a separate patch. This patch is only for the changes.

Can you please open another tab here and check that it's now 'newTabUrl' again. Just to make sure returning from pb mode restores everything as it should.

Great, thanks! Now let's push it to try and land it afterwards.

Looks like we need to fix another test as well:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/browser_tabMatchesInAwesomebar.js | 'about:privatebrowsing' not found in autocomplete.

And only on Mac there is:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug565667.js | an unexpected uncaught JS exception reported through window.onerror - TypeError: gBrowser is null at chrome://browser/content/browser.js:12548

A simple fix might be to check if (gBrowser) but I'm not sure why it should be null when running the test for bug 565667.

Pages to be registered for the switch-to-tab functionality are first filtered by isBlankPageURL(), which in turn uses BROWSER_NEW_TAB_URL. So ideally, you want to change line 250 of that test (where it checks if the URL is about:blank) to use browserWin.isBlankPageURL()

Because on OSX, browser.js is loaded into non-browser windows, for which gBrowser is null. And that test opens a non-browser window, then attempts to open a tab from it (which is fine, the code handles that), but that involves (eventually) accessing that getter... and them boom.

Can shorten this and make it a bit easier to read:

if (!gBrowser)
  return false;

You could also do this like:

No, in bug 722990 we implemented that no new content can be added to about:newtab while in private browsing mode.
