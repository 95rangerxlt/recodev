In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the same directory (perhaps with "_perwindowpb" appended to its file name), and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.  Note that the original test should only be added to the list of test files in Makefile.in ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING, and the new test file should be added to the list with the reverse condition.

Patch to migrate the test to the new per window private mode

Hi.
I've been trying to migrate this test but I've faced some trouble and have some questions.

My idea was to copy the original test file to the mochitest/bugs folder, under the name test_bug627234_perwindowpb.js and make this test file a per-window private browsing test.

So, I copied the file and replaced the contents with the logic we use to migrate the per-window pb tests. Right now the test does not contain any logic related to the test and should just open two windows, one "normal" and one per-window pb (but this is not happening and that's my concern).

My problem right now is that, whenever I execute the command to run the test:
TEST_PATH=security/manager/ssl/tests/mochitest/bugs/test_bug627234_perwindowpb.js make -C obj-ff-dbg-pb mochitest-browser-chrome

the test file can not be found:
INFO TEST-START | Shutdown
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | (browser-test.js) | No tests to run. Did you pass an invalid --test-path?

I've check the path in the test command, and the path is correct. I recompile the test folders with 
make -C obj-ff-dbg-pb/security/manager/; and 
make -C obj-ff-dbg-pb/security/manager/ssl/tests/; whenever I make a change.

I've also added the corresponding lines to the mochitest/bugs/Makefile.in file, in all of these 3 forms:

1)
ifdef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
MOCHITEST_FILES += \
        test_bug627234_perwindowpb.js \
        $(NULL)
endif

2)
ifdef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
MOCHITEST_CHROME_FILES += \
        test_bug627234_perwindowpb.js \
        $(NULL)
endif

3)
ifdef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
MOCHITEST_BROWSER_FILES += \
        test_bug627234_perwindowpb.js \
        $(NULL)
endif

but none of these have worked in order to execute the new test.

So, I'm asking for guidance here. Am I going the right way? What could be preventing me from executing the testing? What should I modify?

Thanks.
I believe browser-chrome tests need to be called browser_foo.js.

Yes, that's correct.

r- because this test will not actually get run.  I'm wondering how did this pass for you locally...

I think this set up will fix my previous problems.
Please let me know if everything's OK. 

Thanks.
