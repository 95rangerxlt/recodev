The gnomestripe/pmstripe patch of bug 419319 already fixed this partly, but at least the files from browser/themes/winstripe/browser/jar.mn are unconditionally packaged into classic.jar. The aero lines should be moved to the bottom and bracketed with XP_WIN as in the jar.mn's below /toolkit/themes/winstripe/.

OK, this seems to do what I want it to. Although I wonder why Reed didn't do that in bug 419319 where he did the same for the file in toolkit/...
We didn't do it because gnomestripe is a separate theme completely under browser/ instead of being an override on top of it. It didn't make sense to make it more complicated when gnomestripe wasn't even caring about it.
Thanks Reed, I didn't realize that. As we don't override the stuff in browser/themes on OS/2 we need that for our packages.

Checked in to trunk.
Hmm, backed this out again. It caused errors like this on the Windows tinderboxes:

No idea how to solve that...

If you want to switch .jar file (which you don't) then you need a blank line.
Ah yes, that would be the difference against the other patch from attachment 306823. I think even though we don't want to switch the JAR file we need the classic.jar line because we need the % skin line afterwards. Will try more local testing (as far as I can on OS/2).
OK, the trick with the empty line works, thanks for the hint Neil. I can't verify here if chrome registration of the skin works, so I left in the classic.jar line when I relanded this just now.
OK, at least qm-win2k3-01 has cycled and they are still green, so this seems really fixed this time. :-)

Backout of bug 422628 as it caused jar-packaging problems on Windows
