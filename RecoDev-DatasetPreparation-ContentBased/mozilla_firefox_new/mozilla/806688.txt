In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the perwindow/ directory, and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.

Note that the per-window version of this test can have both the private and non-private window simultaneously open as opposed to the current way that the test is structured.  Specifically it should avoid setting usePrivateBrowsing directly.
