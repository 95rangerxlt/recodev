[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by various bugs: 
User impact if declined: Firefox-on-xulrunner setups have some features broken
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): On mozilla builds, resource:/// and resource://gre/ are strictly equivalent (which is why such bugs happen in the first place), so for mozilla builds, this is effectively a noop.
String changes made by this patch: none.
