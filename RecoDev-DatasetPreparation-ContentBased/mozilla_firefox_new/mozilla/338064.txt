same problem on 1.8.1 branch of course
"set browser.formfill.enable to false" is same as
tools>Options>Privacy "Saved Forms"
uncheck "Save information..."
As I said in http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2266185, suggestion wasn't working here (with browser.formfill.enable = true). I changed <SuggestionURL>http://www.google.com/complete/search?csv=t&amp;qu=</SuggestionURL>
to <SuggestionURL><![CDATA[http://www.google.com/complete/search?csv=t&qu=]]></SuggestionURL>
into google.xml (and made similar changes into yahoo.xml) and now it works.
I think it is fundamentally wrong that a user is forced to store his formfill data if he wishes to use suggest.
This seems to be the relevant code that's causing this:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#1228

This is because the search suggestions are implemented using the same autocomplete interface that the form history uses.
+ for now until we decide what we're doing here.

Disables search history (but preserves suggestions) when form history is disabled
Comment on attachment 225086
Disables search history (but preserves suggestions) when form history is disabled

So I was a little bit confused as to why this fixes this bug, but I realized that it works because both nsFormHistory::AddEntry (called to save text in form history after it is entered) and nsFormHistory::AutoCompleteSearch (called to get autocomplete entries from form history when building the popup) already check formfill.enabled and behave accordingly. This means that you can also remove the attribute check at:

r=me with that.
