I understand the concept behind the purpose flag, and it's a good idea, but by removing application/x-moz-keywordsearch it prevents really basic things like having keyword search map to google's "I'm feeling lucky". Not every server can just use a keyword to decide what to do (especially for existing services). It might be a different URL.

Looking at the keyword fixup code, there was no reason to remove application/x-moz-keywordsearch. 

The code in search should have just been changed to not fail if the specific type wasn't found.

That way you could support the old code and still have the new code.

Use keyword if available

This is a simple patch that checks to see if the search engine supports the keyword and if it is there, use it.

This allows existing search engines to work.

This won't affect the builtin search engines because keyword has been removed.

To use this search engine, open scratchpad and type:

window.external.AddSearchProvider("https://bug865218.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=741388");
This is a good change. I agreed with Mike's reasoning: I understand the recent change, but it no longer supports certain URL styles.
http://mycroftproject.com/ has over 23000 OSDs (!). Some of these are bound to be broken by this changes.
If we can support both old and new, that's certainly better.
Any thoughts on this gavin?
I'm kind of on the fence. I guess it's a valid use case, but I hate to have these kind of gross hacks that will likely benefit few people in practice.

I guess the net cost is relatively low. You can use NS_NAMED_LITERAL_STRING to avoid duplicating the "application/x-moz-keywordsearch" string.

Can you document this on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Creating_OpenSearch_plugins_for_Firefox ?

Patch for checkin

This is the final patch for check with NS_NAMED_LITERAL_STRING

Am I free to check this in at this point?

application/x-moz-keywordsearch should still be used in keyword search (nsDefaultURIFixup.cpp)
