I wrote a script that looks for resource:// uris in the built code and checks whether the corresponding files exist, so as to detect problems with resource://gre/ used where resource:/// was meant. It turns out it also detects "problems" with imports of files that are not installed in every cases.

For instance, in browser.js, a file that is only installed in windows builds is imported, as well as a file that is only installed when the crash reporter is built.

While these are cosmetic issues, it would make my life easier if the patch i'm about to attach would be applied.
