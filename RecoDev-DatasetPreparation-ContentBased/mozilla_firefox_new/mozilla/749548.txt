On Mac, there is no IEProfileMigrator.js.
On Linux, there is neither.

Yet, in both builds, they both are in the components manifest.

The commit message is misleading because we can't detect "when they are installed" at build time. Something like this would be better:
"Only reference IE and Safari migrators in components manifest on supported operating systems."
It's "installed" in the "$(NSINSTALL)" sense.

I actually meant "backport to 14"... Merge didn't help my numbering.

We don't typically take correctness fixes with no user impact.


IEProfileMigrator.js and SafariProfileMigrator.js are always in the components manifest
