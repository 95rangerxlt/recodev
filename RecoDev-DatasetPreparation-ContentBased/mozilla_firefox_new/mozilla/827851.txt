Since bug 822017 is the only time we've touched it in months, it seems likely.

Ehsan - can you take a look this morning? We'll want to spin Aurora as soon as this is resolved.

Patch (v1)

The problem is that we never create dist/bin/distribution/extensions.

This patch fixes it.

$(call mkdir_deps,$(DISTROEXT)) is supposed to create that directory.

Move the rules from bug 822017 after including rules.mk

Subtle case of variables not being there before including rules.mk. Can't move everything since INSTALL_TARGETS requires rules.mk to be included afterwards. And no need for an ifdef because all_xpis is not defined unless the original ifdef matches.
