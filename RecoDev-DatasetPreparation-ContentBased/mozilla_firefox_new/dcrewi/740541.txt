STR:

1. Go to any site with iframes
   here's a simple example: http://manda.com/iframe/
2. open the style editor
3. only stylesheets from the main page are listed

expected results: should be able to edit styles that live within the iframes


This is also noticeable if you inspect an element in the iframe and then click the link from the property view into the style editor. The editor that pops up is empty.

I'm going to bounce this to Heather who is working on the Style Editor right now.
Thanks for the patch, David. This might have to wait for bug 816967 (remote style editor). That patch changes the structure of the style editor a lot, and should land very soon.

So sorry about the delay. This looks good. It'll have to be rebased on the new Style Editor that uses the remote debugging protocol. If you want to do that, go for it. There is no more StyleEditorChrome.jsm file, this code would go in the StyleEditorActor in toolkit/devtools/styleeditor/dbg-styleeditor-actors.js, and the test would have to use the new API (see the other tests for reference).

Otherwise, I can rebase it myself soon, it's up to you. Thanks again for the patch.

Don't have to change this, but cool fact, we can use for...of loops here to avoid the counter. `for (let iframe of iframes)`.

patch v2, rewrite on top of remotable style editor

It wasn't a rebase so much as a rewrite. At least the test didn't have to be modified much.

Thanks for rewriting it for the remote editor. This looks good. I've got a try server run here: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a5d226c406b9. Barring any failures I can check it in.

Should wait for the aPanel.UI.on("editor-added") event since we're checking editors.

I can change this before checking in.
