the original plan was to be more unified-like, and we seem to have lost that a little.  We can tweak this by reusing the bookmark toolbar CSS, and cleaning that up a little, patch upcoming for late inclusion, already got signoff from mscott since this affects Thunderbird as well.

I actually liked it white!  It looked a great deal better then the light gray.

This looks wrong to me:

Sorry, I have to ask again: Why repeat-x as a value for background-image? Is this a Mozilla quirk?
DÃ£o: you'll have better luck if you directly state your objection in detail, rather than making vague statements like "this looks wrong." If instead you say:

Mano: if you're going to break up a "background" shorthand rule into separate rules, I think you should put the repeat into "background-repeat" where the specification says it belongs, rather than tacking it onto the end of the "background-image" rule, since even if that does happen to work in XUL, there's no reason why it should, nor reason to expect it to keep working.

then you're more likely to get a reaction.
the graphic used is basically adding a groove to the top of the toolbar, with normal repeat that would show in the wrong place, unless the image was super-tall.  repeat-x is a w3c standard, but I misused it in the original patch.
What's that you say? Throw more words at this?

Nobody's saying it isn't a standard, what they are saying is that with our previous, and proposed future, use of "background-image: ... repeat-x" we are either doing absolutely nothing, no repeat and no image, if our invalid rule is properly being dropped on the floor, or we are exploiting a bug in our parsing of CSS (which I don't think we are, I think we're doing nothing), because while "background: ... repeat-x" is valid, if we use individual rules rather than the single "background:" shorthand rule, we need to instead use "background-image: url(...); background-repeat: repeat-x;"

So, rather than explaining the intent, didn't you mean "r-, please fix my mistake and request branch approval for a fix there, too"?
Ah, no wonder it seems to work in 2.0: just to keep people on their toes, attachment 240429 wasn't actually what you checked in to the branch - sometime between when you attached it and when you checked it in, you realized that you couldn't tack a repeat-x on at the end of a background-image, so you fixed what you checked in, but not the patch that Mano's now ported to the trunk. I was starting to really wonder wtf, until I realized that (and that the image isn't actually applied to the navigation toolbar).

Looks like this broke the address bar on the 120706 trunk builds?

Will include image.

I'd say that's unrelated, since the patch touches background rules only.
I filed bug 363125 for that broken location bar
