Enter text in Google's main page INPUT TEXT box (http://www.google.com).
In nightly (Win/binary) builds up to 20021031 hitting enter once got a 
single pop-up warning box.  With builds 20021108,11,14 the pop-up warning 
occurs twice (i.e. ENTER must be hit 3 times in total to submit form.)
- note I unfortunately don't have any of the builds between 
10/31 and 11/08 to test (can do if someone can point me at them.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Phoenix under XP ; surf to http://www.google.com
2. enter search term - e.g. phoenix
3. hit <ENTER> key
4. pop-up form submission warning - hit <ENTER> key - in 20021031 build, done.
5. in 200211nn builds get another popup warning (duplicate)
6. hit <ENTER> again, done.

Actual Results:  
depending upon whether Phoenix version was 20021031 build or
20021108 and later ones gets either normal (single) pop-up 
form submission warning or duplicated warning (respectively.)


Expected Results:  
Expected a single warning pop-up.

bug report UPDATE - neglected to mention the following  

a) either MOUSE click or hitting <ENTER> key gets same (duplicate popup) behavior
b) in all test cases the default unzipping of the Windows nightly build was used
cleaning up summary. not a conformation.summaries should contain the kinds of
information necessary for locating the bug with queries or within a buglist.
builds affected or not affected belong as part of the description and not the
summary.

Was "repeated mouse click or "ENTER" key required for FORM Submit; single worked
in 20021031 build; broken in 20021108/20021111/20021114"

I can confirm this behavior on W98, build 20021204.

I imagine this is caused by Satchel, as this bug only shows itself in the first
tab; and Satchel only works in the first tab (bug 177797).
still there, phoenix 0.5 (20021207).  can confirm comment 5 that it only occurs
in the first tab. (btw, is it strange to anyone else that i get 10 votes for the
main browser, 5 for chimera, and 100 for phoenix?)
Does this problem still exist? I just tested it using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U;
WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.3b) Gecko/20030204 Phoenix/0.5 and it seems to work - at
least when I try the provided steps in a new browser-window (with no tabs) - or
do I have to use tabbed browsing to reproduce the problem? Of course I need to
uncheck the checkbox "Alert me whenever..." to get rid off the warning.
FYI, this bug is apparantly not related to bug 177797.

I still see it on W98 with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.3b)
Gecko/20030224 Phoenix/0.5

quick fix

This has nothing to do with either satchel or tabs (directly).

The browser ctor attempts to initialize session history, global history, and
the security UI (form submit warnings, etc).

In Mozilla, apparantly none of these happen in the initial browser ctor, so
they are (also) initialized in the navigator.js Startup() function.

In Px, all three are also initialized in the browser.js Startup(), but the
security UI turns out to have been initialized via the browser ctor already. 
Therefore, the security UI is initialized twice in the first browser instance,
and you get 2 security dialogs.

I disabled the init in the Startup() function and things seem to work.	Tested
in first tab, second tab, and a second window:

1) form submit appears once when submitting a form unencrypted
2) lock icon correctly appears and disappears when switching between secure and
unsecure tabs
3) lock icon correctly appears and disappears when going to/from a secure site
in a tab

was the fix for this checked in?  it seems to be working now, 20030504.
WFM now.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030511 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

It doesn't appear that my patch was checked in.  I guess a trunk checkin
inadvertently fixed this bug also.
Consensus seems to be WFM. Blake, close?
-> WFM
IsoLnCHiP and I can both reproduce.  Reopening.
*** Bug 260674 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Steps to reproduce:
1. In about:config, set security.warn_submit_insecure to true and
security.warn_submit_insecure.show_once to true.  This is the default configuration.
2. In the first tab of a browser window, submit Google search form.
3. When you get the first dialog, check the checkbox and click "Continue".

Result: Another (identical) dialog appear.  Double dialogs continue to appear
whenever you submit insecure forms in the first tab of any window.
This problem only occurs on the 1.0 Branch, not reproducible with 2004-11-03 mac
trunk build -- on the trunk the dialogue has no checkbox at all, and it shows
only the first time a form is encountered, and then disappears forever on any
subsequent forms. 

Regression -- the problem is not reproducible with Firefox 0.9. Reproducible
with 0.10.1, 1.0rc1, 1.0rc2. 

Bug is reproducible not only on Windows, but on Mac OS X too (tested with
Firefox 0.10.1, 1.0rc2). 

This bug poses the user to either choose super annoying security (two messages
instead of one) or be insecure (no messages at all). It should definitely be
fixed for 1.0. 
Ben, can you take a look at this and see if it's anything obvious? Seems kinda
ugly. 
Not going to block but we'd consider an ultralowrisk fix.
This patch does fix the bug. The real fix shouldn't leave these lines commented
out, just remove them.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Still had this bug on updating form 1.0PR . However applying the attached patch
just now finally fixed the issue, so far no negative aspects to applying it.
I see the same effect (any "insecure submission" pop-up appears twice instead of
once) in the official Firefox 1.0 release. The last Mozilla (1.7.3) does not
show that effect. Both running on Windows/XP SP2 (and other fixes, just in case
it would matter). I'm surprised that there isn't a fix already.
The bug of the first tab can be reproduced on the recent Firefox nightly trunk
build too.
(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20050105 Firefox/1.0+)

As a matter of fact, there is a fix (its attached to this bug report). It just
never gets integrated into the main builds, I really dont understand why. 

I personally considder this bug to be a major pain in the behind, as I like
haveing the confirmation (often enough I've noticed something just after
submitting and been glad I could just say cancel and correct the error)

I have manually applyed the fix now allready on at least two computers, and it
works fine, however its annoying to do (lots of possibiltys to make a mistake).
Having this bug around has kept me from updating like more than a dozen computer
from 0.9 to 1.0. Shows you I dont considder it a minor bug ;-)
Let's get this bugfix integrated into the main source and released. This is an
ugly problem that detracts from the user experience and diminishes Firefox's
reputation as a credible contender.
I can't reproduce this anymore in 1.0 or the trunk... what am I doing wrong?
Go to www.applerockies.com, select University of Colorado - Colorado Springs,
choose Individual Purchases. Click the green "I Accept" button on the shopping
agreement and notice the two "Security Warning" popups.

Sorry for the crazy details, but it's where I noticed this bug!
This is actually critical, imo, per comments in bug 282784...
So... I'd really like to get the bug this is blocking in for 1.8b2 (since it's
an api change).  Any chance of getting this bug fixed by then?

patch to remove the re-init in browser.js

discussed this with bz, the fix for bug 138012 should have rendered this
completely unneccessary.  Requesting a= for 1.1a so we can take the API change
in bug 282784 as well.	If we get reports of bustage because the browser.xml
ctor fails (extremely doubtful at this juncture) we can add a conditional
re-init here before final, but we don't expect that will ever be necessary.
