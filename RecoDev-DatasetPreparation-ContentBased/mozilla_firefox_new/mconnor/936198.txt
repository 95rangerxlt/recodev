Yahoo has s recently updated their Logo and request that we update the search drop-down with the new logo for Desktop & Mobile.  Due to some confusion on a localization bug, this should have been prioritized back in Sept.  

I would appreciate any support to expedite this as quickly as possible!

*** Bug 925037 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Currently waiting on Yahoo! to confirm which locales should have the new icon (some locales are still using the red favicon, such as Japan: http://www.yahoo.co.jp/).

Good to know. 

It would probably be easier to get the list of locales who shouldn't get the new icon (I found only Japan so far).

Encoded PNG (shorter)

I wonder if we should use a data uri without % (about 10% shorter).

Note also that there's a new funny version of the image on trunk for Metro (74px, standard icon + purple canvas).
+1 for the encoded PNG.  Is there a good tool for doing those conversions?

Word from Yahoo! is Japan (so ja-JP and ja-JP-mac) and Australia (we don't produce en-GB-au builds, though I sort of wish we did) are the only locales that still use the old branding.  Is there a good way to do this mass change? (I know we discussed briefly on Friday, but I've lost that scrollback)
I usually rely on this website for conversion
http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter

Consider that % breaks the image on mobile, meaning the searchplugin will lose its icon.

Unfortunately there's no tool to easy do that for all locales, but lucky you I'm actually doing it in bug 939834 (on Aurora and Central, we're too close to end of the cycle to touch Beta). 
All "official" (requested) locales on mobile already have the right icon on all branches. 

Once you fix en-US, a lot of locales will get automatically the new icon on all branches. On a side note, I think we need to fix Bing as well.
Replacement has been completed on all locales (mobile, desktop) on Aurora. At this point we need the updated en-US to have all icons in place (excluding Japanese).
Mike - any update on getting this lifted? It's almost a month and I need to get back to Yahoo with a status...   Thanks, Joanne

Shouldn't there be an update for the HiDPI icon as well?
Why does the % character break the image on mobile?
There should, but really that's a big project we need to tackle more consistently.  This is minimum stuff, will do a pass of "get 32x32 icons from partners" as a followup.

Flipping review flag, as this need to match up with the way that bug 795495 handled HiDPI icons, and there might be a test that needs to be updated.
(In reply to Jared Wein [:jaws] from comment #13)
> Why does the % character break the image on mobile?

No idea about the reason, I only know because I found the image broken in 3 or 4 locales.
Bug 892924 was filed to fix it.

hiDPI for small icon.  Will wait on Yahoo! for a 74x74 icon since I can't seem to find one remotely big enough to not look terrible.

(I assume you tested this doesn't regress retina appearance)
Since you're touching metro here too, CCing bbondy/jimm just as a heads up.

The Metro version.  Should be a straightforward image update, I'd like to at least get this on Aurora to match the other patch.

I must admit that I'm lost.

I see approval for mozilla-aurora but no reference to landing. So I checked the repositories (see attached file):
* there's no reference here but apparently this patch landed on aurora last cycle and it's now on beta
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/79f8a9a64075
* this patch never landed on central, so we are now displaying the wrong image on both central and aurora

I filed bug 967388 to track l10n updates.
Yeah, I landed on aurora, and then inbound was closed until I ran out of time to land there.  I'll land on inbound and aurora (again) shortly.
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/bbc51e586d3f  for inbound.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/0ddf294abb12 for landing on aurora (again) post-merge to beta.
