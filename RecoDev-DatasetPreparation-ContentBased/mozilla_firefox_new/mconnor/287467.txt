After playing the flash game in the URL and then closing the tab it is in, the
close tab button stops working.
This happens the majority of the time but occasionally everything seems fine. I
imagine this is an issue with flash, and I have only seen it with this specific
flash movie.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have firefox open with at least one page loaded.
2. Load the URL (http://www.officinepixel.com/online/games/lab.htm) into a new tab.
3. Enter the game (click a few times till the animation sequence starts)
4. Close the tab with the game on it.
5. Try to close the tab that is now selected.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. The close tab button does nothing and the clost tab in the
context menu also does nothing.
Changing to a different tab and back again makes seems to fix the problem.


Expected Results:  
The close tab button should close the tab.

WFM now too

is anyone still able to reproduce with the latest build ?
Still seeing on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2)

Some additional notes.

After you close the tab with the flash on it, the next tab displays but the
status bar and url remain as they were with the flash tab. Opening a new tab at
this point leaves the url and status bar the same still. Trying to open a page
on this new tab at this point will not work, neither from the url bar or
bookmarks. Changing tabs fixes everything though.

I can close any tab, forgot to look at the other issues

1.Indeed the locationbar has the url of the closed tab and doesn't change when
you switch to any ! other tab.

2.A bookmark won't load

3.Get MiniT extension (drag&indicator) and notice the indicator jumping around
if you get near the "dead" tab

somehow a weird number of things happen around this tab

I don't know if we should not file a string of bugs, 1 for each issue ?

CC-ing mconnor to let him give a verdict on how we should proceed.




The more I look at this the stranger it gets. When you try to close a tab but
fail, the js console gives:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMXULElement.boxObject]"  nsresult:
"0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: get_docShell :: line 0"  data: no]

When you have opened the new tab and try to browse to a bookmark with it, you
get the same error.

Now for more fun. If instead of closing the flash game you switch to the tab to
the left of it, then close that tab, the flash game is displayed again but the
tab's title is that of the tab you just closed. Now trying to close the flash
tab gives:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Node was not found"  code: "8"
nsresult: "0x80530008 (NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_FOUND_ERR)"  location:
"chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbrowser.xml Line: 1192"]
Trying to close it a second time gives:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebProgress.removeProgressListener]" 
nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbrowser.xml :: removeTab :: line 1151" 
data: no]
You can then browse away from the flash game happily, but the browser and tab
title remain stuck.

Oh and all this testing was with a totally clean profile so no extensions to
worry about.

Do you have any idea when this ever regressed ?
If we have a date we should be able to find the cause
Ok I managed to narrow it down to between builds from 8th and 9th March. The
checkins are shown here:
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/bonsai/cvsquery.cgi?module=PhoenixTinderbox&date=explicit&mindate=1110289140&maxdate=1110379740

Hopefully that should help pinpoint the problem.

I just found this bug again with another flash game:

http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/triplex2/site/game/game_mission.html

This bug appears to be a little more diverse. It also happens with this url,
where there isn't a flash game, but a java applet.

http://www.houseof3d.com/pete/applets/wireframe/fractal/

I also often see similar behavior when viewing PDFs. I don't know whether it's
the same issue, because in my case usually other tabs can be closed normally,
and it's just one tab that won't go away.
testing here, the closebutton is broken, but not middle-click and contextmenu close.

simple one-liner, zero risk, fixes the bug.
