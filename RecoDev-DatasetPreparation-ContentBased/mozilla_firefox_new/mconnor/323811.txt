Add correct branch version for Firefox 2.0. Version shouldn't be 1.5 Branch, should be something else.
Is there any chance this change can be made sooner rather than later. As a tester, I have rather a lot of installs of firefox for testing purposes (1.0, 1.07, 1.5.0.1, 1.5.0.2builds, 2.0builds, 3.0builds; along with various different combinations of Cairo-enabled and Places-enabled).

To be quite honest, it's getting rather confusing as to what version is what, especially when trying to differentiate between 1.5.0.x and 2.0
Renamed 1.5 branch to 1.5.0.x branch, added 2.0 branch
