Is there anything about the existing icon that needs to be changed other than making it match the style of the rest of the set more closely (i.e.: do we want to lose the bug?)
Jay: Asa and I talked about the bug, it can stay or an alternative would be the icon on this site: http://reporter.mozilla.org/app/. Asa was not sure it could be sized down small enough to fit on an icon and still look good. But in general we are fine with the bug, we just want to make sure the style matches.

I think the original intent of this bug was to make it match the style of the rest of the set.

note, safari (which had this first?) has a similar icon, but their button is "Report Bug" which makes more sense along with the image.

I'll screen shot safari (for comparison.

Possible Report Site icon

This is a possibility using elements found in other icons from the new theme. I'm a little concerned that it might look like a journal or notes rather than a bug, though that's inherent in the idea of a pen(cil) and paper. 

I like Safari's label, but their bug is more clearly a spider which always sort of threw me. I get that it's part of the web, but it seemed to me that a "bug" is more like the current icon than a spider.
Any thoughts on this from the crew?

Report Site Large and Small PNGs
The latest nightly has the new icon, but the small size is wrong - looks like it's using a region of the large size.
Bug 352160 was filed about the reporter button having the wrong size.
