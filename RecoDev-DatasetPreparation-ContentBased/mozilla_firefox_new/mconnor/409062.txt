It should be possible to open data: URLs in new tabs, new windows, etc.  It looks like this behavior was disabled in bug 251137, but I don't see why.  It works just fine, and I often use it, for example, when looking at reftest results from the output of http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/tools/reftest/clean-reftest-output.pl

I think the part of the patch for bug 251137 for data: URLs should be backed out.

Note that Jesse said the same in bug 251137 comment 22.

I agree.
testcase in attachment 293982 (in the other bug).

The testcase's data: link behaved in a perfectly reasonable fashion before the fix for bug 251137
This does not block the final release of Firefox 3.
I backed out the patch from bug 251137, so this should be fixed now.
