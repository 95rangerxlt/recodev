devtools use a lot of Promise objects implemented in JS.
But bug 884279 renames Future to Promise and this makes a name collision.

Talking on IRC on #devtools, we found 2 possible solutions:

a) Rename Promise to JSPromise (or to something else)
b) do some destructuring assignment on import, like: let {resolve, reject, etc. } = Cu.import("promise.js");

In a separate thread we'd decided that we should be doing s/Promise/promise/g. Would this solve the problem?
Yes, It does.
I'll work on this.

Rename Promise to promise to avoid collisions with the forthcoming DOM Promise implementation

This turned out to be a lerger patch than I expected, due to us using lowercase promise as a local variable identifier. Maybe destructuring on import would have resulted in a shorter patch, but I don't know for sure or care. All tests pass locally.

It's kind of annoying that we can't call 'promise' 'promise' any more. Ho Hum.
How about migrating to DOM Promise?

> How about migrating to DOM Promise?

This bug is a prerequisite for DOM Future to be renamed to Promise. We will likely migrate to that once its ready and has all the API methods we need.
