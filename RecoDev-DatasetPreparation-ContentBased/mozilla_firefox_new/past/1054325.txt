Handler function TabActor.prototype.onReload's delayed body threw an exception:
TypeError: this.docShell is null

Stack: TabActor.prototype.webNavigation@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/
loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/devtools/server/actors/webbrowser.js:655:5
TabActor.prototype.onReload/<@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js

makeInfallible/<@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource:/
/gre/modules/devtools/DevToolsUtils.js:83:14
Line: 655, column: 4

STR:
1) Start Firefox, open the toolbox, select the Options panel
2) Close Firefox, check the system console

It looks like it’s because OptionsPanel.destroy calls
this.target.activeTab.reconfigure

... which asynchronously executes onReconfigure, which calls
_toggleJsOrCache, which calls onReload, which calls 
this.webNavigation.reload, which uses this.docShell, which is 
null at that time because Firefox is closing....

Does that make sense?
is this known problem?

Don't try to update the debugging options while the browser is shutting down

It's harmless, but I've seen it too many times to pretend I'm not annoyed any more.
