Don't throw when reloading devtools if it succeeds

Not sure how the lower-case s got there in the first place, but upper case S is what we commonly use.

Hmm, the message really should come up when you throw, and that has the advantage of reporting a failure. Although the error status isn't actually used anywhere, so r+
What I changed from throw to return was actually the branch taken on successful srcdir lookup. Perhaps it used to throw in the opposite case in the past.

We need to rename these two strings: s and S are two different things when it comes to variables, and we want to be sure that all locales are updated.

What are the two different meanings?  I think I've only seen "S" used before.

That's beyond my understanding of the code, but things like bug 1133554 (and I guess this one) happen.

Hmm, that led me down a terrifying rabbit hole... :)

Seems like a main difference is wide / unicode strings vs. C strings, which causes the string to terminate early if you use the wrong one.  Anyway, we'll want the correct "S" everywhere, so bumping the string ID seems needed.
