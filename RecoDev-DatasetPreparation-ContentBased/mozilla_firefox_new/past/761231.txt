I've noticed that the font for the various panels within the Debugger is list-box, which looks pretty ugly on Windows and feels Windows 3.1-ish.

If we switch to font:message-box we'll get Segoe UI on Windows and the respective UI fonts for the other platforms as well.

This should do it.
Shouldn't this be message-box by default? What happens if you just remove font: -moz-list;?

Good point, it looks identical. We probably used to require them when the UI was in HTML.
