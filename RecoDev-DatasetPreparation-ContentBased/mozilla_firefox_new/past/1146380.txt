Bug 1071880 added a warning that is shown every time Firefox spends a lot of time in the compartment of an add-on. Valence should be excluded from this check because it's an official Firefox feature that only happens to be shipped as an add-on.

Furthermore, the code that implements this check treats the devtools loader as an add-on causeing the following error to appear in the browser console:

couldn't look up addon: fx-devtools nsBrowserGlue.js:571:0

This patch makes both the error and the warning go away.

Backed out for a syntax error that was causing other pref reads to fail:

Sorry about that! I could swear it was working fine when I tested it locally... *sigh*

I have found the same error about making Firefox slow on :

User Agent 	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID 	20150323030203

Looks like its fixed on today's nightly build :

Build ID 	20150629134017
User Agent 	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0

Suggesting STATUS -> VERIFIED FIXED

[Bugday-20150701]
Not sure this is fixed. I saw a "would you like to disable Valence" prompt in the current nightly while using the browser toolbox.

I believe the remaining issue affects all SDK based add-ons, see bug 1191342.


Firefox shouldn't be warning that Valence might make it run slowly
