We changed the add-on name to Valence, but we haven't updated the default value of devtools.webide.adaptersAddonURL in webide-prefs.js. Therefore every new Firefox installation will attempt to look for Valence in a non-existing location.

It may also be a good idea to symlink the old location to the new one and change the Makefile to update both on new releases.

Oops!  Okay, I've added fxdt-adapters-<OS>-latest.xpi symlinks for each OS, which point to Valence latest.  As long as the symlinks are kept around, we shouldn't need to re-target them on each release.

Still need to update WebIDE's pref.
Just verified WebIDE can now install Valence correctly if it was not installed before.

Update devtools.webide.adaptersAddonURL to the new Valence location

I verified that this change lets a new profile download the add-on as expected.
