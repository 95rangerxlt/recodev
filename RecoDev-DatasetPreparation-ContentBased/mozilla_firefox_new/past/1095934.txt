Identifying Aurora builds by the update channel results in non-nightly builds needing to have the update channel set in .mozconfig. We can do better than that.

Don't use the update channel to identify aurora

I've been told that I should do this before, but it got forgotten in all the #fx10 craze.

Actually, after having built an aurora iceweasel, let me retract here. This should be test -n "$MOZ_DEV_EDITION", and MOZ_DEV_EDITION should be set in browser/branding/aurora/configure.sh.

Yes (but double check it actually works ;) )
Yep, I just built locally with only setting --with-branding and I got myself a nice Firefox Developer Edition.

Why? This makes merge logistics more complicated (additional configure.sh change required on uplift). I don't particularly care to support the "easy building non-devedition from Aurora" use case.

Huh? What changes are required to browser/branding/aurora/configure.sh on uplift?
Sorry, I was confused and thought we were talking about confvars.sh. Nevermind!


Aurora builds should not be identified by the update channel



Don't use the update channel to identify aurora (bug 1095934). r=glandium 

Define MOZ_DEV_EDITION in aurora branding configuration (bug 1095934). r=glandium
