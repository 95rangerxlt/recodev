Starting the browser displays the following in the console:

Chrome file doesn't exist: /Users/past/src/remote-debug/obj-ff-dbg/dist/NightlyDebug.app/Contents/MacOS/chrome/browser/content/browser/debugger-prefs.js

The cause is that the debugger-prefs.js entry is missing from browser/devtools/jar.mn, but the root cause is that browser/devtools/debuger/jar.mn wasn't removed in bug 686714.
