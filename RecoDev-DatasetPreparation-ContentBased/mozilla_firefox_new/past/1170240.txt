I had yesterday's Nightly installed. I opened the "About Nightly" window to force-download the update like I do every morning. Before I clicked the "Restart Nightly to install update" button, the green arrow used to show up immediately in the hamburger menu, but it no longer appears after bug 1102409 was fixed.

Over irc I was told that this is due to a devtools change.

Yes, see the blocking bug.
Just noticed the 'hamburger' code mis-uses the update-staged notification. That notification is only sent when staging can be performed and when staging is turned on. I'm more than willing to review this code but no one has flagged me on any of this.

Sorry, I somehow thought you had at least seen the patch from bug 1080406. Can you clarify which cases this code doesn't handle well? I'll post a quick patch that displays the badge immediately on Nightly, but I'm happy to fix any other bug in this code.

It doesn't appear to handle the case where staging is not possible or staging is disabled via pref. Try setting app.update.staging.enabled to false to disable it and you will get the same result as when staging is not possible.

Only delay the hamburger button update badge in developer edition

This is the tweak to only delay the badge on dev edition. I haven't looked at the staging issue yet.

You should probably get rstrong to review the actual code, if not here then in another bug.

Absolutely, the next patch that will deal with staging updates is his.
