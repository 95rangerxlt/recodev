Error: No running window found

Firefox running, of course. Older nightbuilds was OK, but RC is wrong.

I can confirm this with here, also with Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;
rv:1.7) Gecko/20040608 Firefox/0.8.

It may be a duplicate of #246168.
*** Bug 246310 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This bug is present in 0.9:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040615 Firefox/0.9
Marking as NEW (per dupe and user comments).
If I understand problem clearly, this bug affects for example Thunderbird users.
Asking for Firefox 1.0 blocking.

Should this belongs to OS Integration component?
Workaround (idea from Bug 246644):
Instead of 
firefox -remote "openUrl(http://foo.bar)"

use

./run-mozilla.sh ./mozilla-xremote-client -a firefox "openUrl(http://foo.bar)"
An even easier workaround:
firefox -a firefox -remote "openURL(...)"

you must then first cd to the install directory of firefox.

Comments here: http://lwn.net/Articles/89519/ (3/4 of the way down the page or
so) suggest that this is a problem with the profile dir change.  However,
editing the firefox script as suggested doesn't solve the problem for me, so I
can't confirm that it is indeed the cause.

And yes, this is the same as bug 246168 so one of them should be duped.

This only works without the new-window or new-tab options otherwise it returns with:

Error: Failed to send command: 509 internal error

this from:

./firefox -a firefox -remote 'openURL('www.mozilla.org', new-tab)'

Use ./firefox -a firefox -remote "openURL(www.mozilla.org,new-tab)"
or ./firefox -a firefox -remote 'openURL(www.mozilla.org,new-tab)'

It is important to note that

./firefox -a firefox -remote "openurl(www.mozilla.org,new-window)" 

WORKS, but

./firefox -a firefox -remote "openurl(www.mozilla.org, new-window)" 

FAILS with "Error: Failed to send command: 509 internal error"
The difference between those two commands is that there is a space between the
openURL() parameters.






that's fixed on trunk, blizzard did it.  Someone please file a bug assigned to
me to backport that to aviary :)
Yeah, sounds like a dup of bug #242123.
*** Bug 248149 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Merged bug 242123 fix from the trunk to the aviary branch, and merged bug 244060
fix from the aviary branch to the trunk, so I think everything mentioned here is
now fixed.

Does that mean that it should be fixed for 0.9.1? It's not the case AFAICS.
er, Firefox 0.9.1 was released 8-10 days before the fix was checked in, so no. 
1.0 RC1 will have the fix.
