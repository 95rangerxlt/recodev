just clean them up.

prepare-repackages-% and prepare-upload-% are currently unused in browser/locales/Makefile.in

None of our release engineering scripts, nor any existing build rules use them. Just get rid of them, and make life easier to understand.

wow no wonder I barely remember these targets.
They are from back in 2008.

As we looked around they are not in used anymore.

I see APP_VERSION being used on toolkit files but I can't tell if it is the same one as you are removing.

Axel, do you know?

the test/ ones don't expand anything from a makefile, and its app-code that expands them.

The XPIProvider.jsm and plugin*Datasource.js use regex to expand these based on variables local to their respective scopes. None of the makefiles included uses this var as defined here. (fwiw Thunderbird also includes l10n.mk and does not define APP_VERSION in its locales/Makefile.in)

Per a chat with armen in IRC, we're keeping the APP_VERSION (with my XXX Comment) just to be extra safe in this end-game. The rest is perfectly safe, and simply unused cleanup.

For added safety once this lands I'll verify with a few repacks from the following nightly, and/or get one or two manually kicked immediately after I land this.

I can't see why we'd take this now, please renominate if you really need this for some reason that isn't in the bug.

FTR, if you're asking questions to some Axel guy, it might make sense to CC one.
