Deleting code and switching from preprocessor to CSS variables?  Sounds good to me :).  I'll let Victor decide whether we need to send this through a ux review or not.

Why isn't this needed anymore?

This fixes an issue on OSX where pressing on the security icon would make it disappear.
I'll get to this asap. Sorry about the wait.

Very nice, much cleaner!
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/3d27abe9852b
Changes look nice and I like the highlight on hover. Just a couple of issues I wanted to point out from my early testing:

I think the white text on black list items on the network panel is a bit hard on the eyes. Looking at https://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups/devTools/ux-refresh-2013/DarkTheme-Network@2x.png - the text font color should be grey like the tabs which is better for UX [1]. 

I also notice the reload button isn't really clear that it is a button because of the dark background in the button.

The background colors used seems darker than shorlander's mockup. Was this intentional?

I think changes like this would also really benefit from a ui-review from shorlander prior to landing.

I tried to minimize the use of custom colors as much as I could, and I have privileged the colors provided by our variables. 
Anyway, can you file a followup and needinfo Stephen on it ?
