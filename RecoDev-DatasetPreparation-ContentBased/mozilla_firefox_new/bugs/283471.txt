After test any site that I open with Dreamweaver with the preview option (F12
key), the "Go Back and Forward" buttons doesn't respond. All the other buttons
work perfectly. In the address bar, the URL of the site do not correspond with
the site you are viewing in the tab.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a site build it in dreamweaver MX (the first version)
2.Set your Firefox as the default browser in order to preview the site with it
3.Press F12 key or the preview button, many times, do not close your browser.
4.Try to navigate normally without close the browser.

Actual Results:  
The Forward and go back buttons don't respond and the last URL is stuck in the
address bar.

Expected Results:  
Still work as usual

Are you able to reproduce this in a recent build?

Now with the Firefox 1.0.1 version seems to work fine.

Thank you.
