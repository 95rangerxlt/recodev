Even though Vista automatically elevates 7-Zip SEA's we should embed a manifest and specify requireAdministrator.

manifest

Ted, this is the manifest I am planning on embedding to the 7zSD.sfx. Could you give it a once over? Thanks
beltzner, could I get you to go over the file properties for our installer's self-extracting archive?

"CompanyName", "Mozilla"
"FileDescription", "Firefox"
"FileVersion", "4.42"
"InternalName", "7zS.sfx"
"LegalCopyright", "Mozilla"
"OriginalFilename", "7zS.sfx.exe"
"ProductName", "Firefox"
"ProductVersion", "4.42"

I personally think we should change
"FileDescription" from "Firefox" to "Firefox Installer"

Yup, that seems right to me. After all, the SFX is the installer, installing the product which is Firefox.

manifest

I can't find any real documentation on this on the web, but it matches all the samples I've seen.

What does requireAdministrator do? Does this mean that ordinary users can't install Firefox to their home directory? That would make me very sad.

This is pretty much currently the case on Vista since it detects we are a 7-Zip SEA and requires elevation... I have been thinking of ways to solve this for Firefox 3.0.
Filed bug 370571 to provide the ability to install as a non-admin user.
We are going to go with asInvoker and use the sea in bug 370571
Fixed by the landing of Bug 370571.


embed manifest in 7zSD.sfx with asInvoker
