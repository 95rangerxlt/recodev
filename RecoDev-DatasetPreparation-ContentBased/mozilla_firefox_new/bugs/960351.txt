This seems to happen randomly with bug 930793, which changes how often we run gecko
events comparing to native os level events in the main loop.

I can't reproduce the issue locally. Guess fix based on

This looks weird at first, but after a discussion on IRC, it seems popup event handling is sometimes a problem that can be fixed with this kind of things.
Some events are dispatched asynchronously, some synchronously, some based on paint event, ...

Since the try build seems to confirm that it fixes this issue, let's go with this fix, but I'd like to ask for a couple of changes:

- A bit more comments to inform what's the exact reason for this fix.
- Use of executeSoon and arrow functions:

element.ownerDocument.defaultView.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  executeSoon(() => tooltip._showOnHover(element));
});
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=7183177b40dc
should give still some more debug information.

Bug 961004 is a new intermittent that just appeared after this fix it seems.
We might want to revisit this.
