remove usage of getImageURLForResolution from search component,

I don't understand what the point of this field is, because the one caller doesn't use 'this.' to use it, and I couldn't find callers outside the file, so I removed it. If I missed something, please let me know.

I think it's an XBL quirk that makes 'this.' implicit in code inside <handler> tags. I've never seen this documented, but observed this behavior a few times.
