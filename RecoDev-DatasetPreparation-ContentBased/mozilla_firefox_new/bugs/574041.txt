Because we will not be taking bug 367539 for Firefox 3.6.6 and 3.5.11, we need to update the removed files list so people downgrading from the Firefox 4 beta to 3.6.6 of 3.5.11 have the proper set of files.

Because we will not be taking bug 367539 for Firefox 3.6.6 and 3.5.11, we need to update the removed files list so people downgrading from the Firefox 4 beta to 3.6.6 of 3.5.11 have the proper set of files.
We don't do this for beta so changing summary.

We only do this when there is a major release such as if 3.6.4 was 3.7... don't think we can do anything here and this is only valid for 3.5.11 and wontfix for 3.6.6.
Why would we not need to do this with files from the beta? I would imagine it is a fairly common scenario to install the beta, find it unstable / not work with plugins, then downgrade back to a stable release.
Betas install into a different directory.

With luck *crosses fingers* this will be the last time this PITA POS has to ever be done again. This was created from a diff of existing files between the latest 3.6.4 and 3.5.11.
Yep, we'll get the true fix in for the next round of point releases. Thanks for getting to this so quick!
