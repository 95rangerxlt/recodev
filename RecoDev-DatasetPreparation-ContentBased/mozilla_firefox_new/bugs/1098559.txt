We should update the hotfix to upgrade to 33.1
Created attachment 8522491
Patch

This mirrors the patch from bug 1072615.
We should actually use Firefox 33.1.1, which fixes a startup crash for users upgrading from Firefox 32 and below.
Sorry, where's 33.1.1? I just asked about this yesterday on #developers and no-one seemed to be aware of a 33.1.1...
I believe it got go to build today, it will be put live tomorrow AFAIK
*cries*
Bug 1021265 is the fix included in 33.1.1 BTW

Respect app.update.url.override for commbank

Don't apply hotfix if app.update.url.override starts with https://update.commbiz.commbank.com.au (see bug 928173 comment 32).

Good eye! :-) Fixed alignment, carrying over r+.

Thanks, Robert!

Paul, just a heads up that we're planning to release a new hotfix with a workaround in place like you described in bug 928173 comment 40.
Thanks all. Much appreciated.

Argh. String.prototype.startsWith() is experimental and only implemented in FF17+[1]. Since we want FF 14.0.1 in particular to perform this check, we'll need to change this to indexOf(). Will post followup shortly.

Replace String.startsWith() with String.indexOf()

This was supposed to check for '== 0'.

Somewhere along the way we started linking directly to the installer on ftp.mozilla.org. Any updates thereafter maintained this mistake. We should link to the bouncer instead.
:gps is handling this in bug 1107156.


Install Firefox 33.1.1 from hotfix
