The following change to install_sub.pl uses a hard coded path to a firefox file:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/mozapps/installer/windows/install_sub.pl#304

system("upx --best -o $dosDistInstall/nsis/7zSD.sfx $dostopsrcdir/other-licenses/7zstub/firefox/7zSD.sfx")

This makes it hard for the upx command to run on thunderbird's version of 7zSD.sfx.

Fortunately, we already have an environment variable with the path to 7zSD.sfx already available to us because we had this same issue with the old installer.

Patch coming up.

the fix

This patch makes us use 7ZipSFXModule for the path to 7zSD.sfx. This environment variable is already used by the old installer in install_sub.pl and installer.cfg for toolkit apps.

This isn't used and doesn't need to be added. r=me with that removed.
