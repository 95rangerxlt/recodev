The cause of this issue hasn't been determined yet. It is not a good bug to work on if this is your first bug you are fixing within Firefox. You may still investigate the cause of this and try to put together a fix but I would recommend finding a bug from http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?ff=1 instead.
I looked closer this bug and it turned out that the animation disappears because the panel does not have the attribute "panelopen".

handleEvent in PanelUI.xml:
popupshowing   (Opening the panel menu - panelopen=true)
overflow       (Opening the subview  - panelopen==true - animation is done)

popupshowing   (Opening the panel menu - panelopen=true)
popupshowing   (Opening the context menu - panelopen=true)
popuphidden    (Closing the context menu - panelopen is removed)
overflow       (Opening the subview  - panelopen==null - animation is not done)

The easiest way is a slight change in the css. This is not fix the problem, but only the workaround. I do not know if it causes any other bugs
panelUI.css

 .panel-subviews {
   -moz-stack-sizing: ignore;
   transform: translateX(0);
   overflow-y: auto;
+  transition: transform 150ms;
 }
 
- .panel-subviews[panelopen] {
-   transition: transform 150ms;
- }

That shouldn't remove the attribute. That's probably not hard to fix. I'll try to sort this out later today or this week.

Australis panel binding shouldn't care about popup events from other things,

That wasn't too hard. I expect this might also fix bug 961535.
