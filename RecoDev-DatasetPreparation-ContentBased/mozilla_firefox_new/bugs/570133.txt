Steps to reproduce:
1) Download and unzip ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/firefox-3.7a5pre.en-US.win64-x86_64.zip
2) Open firefox.exe
3) Visit http://www.adobe.com
4) Click "Get Adobe Flash Player"
5) I reach the page "Flash Player support on 64-bit operating systems" (http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/000/6b3af6c9.html) highlighting this issue:
> Adobe Flash Player is not supported for playback in 64-bit browsers. Flash
> Player will, however, run in a 32-bit browser, running on a 64-bit operating

Expected results:
1) Be able to install Flash

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; en-US; rv:1.9.3a5pre) Gecko/20100603 Minefield/3.7a5pre

Shall we keep this bug just for the lack of Flash or shall we tweak it for a solution for the lack of 64-bit plugins?

Well since Flash Player does not have support for 64bit on Windows or Mac yet this is really more of a feature request than a bug.  Of course many users have made this request in our bug forum and for the record we're working on it :)
Before Mozilla puts a lot effort to resolve this, it might be prudent to privately talk to Adobe about 64 bit support.
On the page armenzg linked it says "We expect to provide native support for 64-bit platforms in an upcoming release of Flash Player following the release of Flash Player 10.1". Of course it would be interesting if Mozilla could get a time estimate or bump the priority. Are there any concrete plans to get 32-bit plugins (in general) working in the 64-bit browser? (through IPC)
Actually it says that it will provide native 64-bit flash after the 10.1 release. That could mean version 10.2, 11, or 15. It's a little bit vague though it does suggest they have it as one of their priorities.
Picking this up.
Now that we have OOPP isn't it possible to use 32-bit plugin-container with 32-bit Flash on 64-bit Firefox? This question applies to all three supported platforms.

You mean that it's possible, besides the 64-bit plugin-container.exe, add the another plugin-container with 32-bit layer for compatibility with "old" 32-bit plugins? It would be nice, of course, esp. because now Minefield x64 doesn't install any 64-bit plugins, at least, on Windows.
Yeah, that's what I meant. Sorry for my inaccuracy.

This would be nice especially for Linux as nspluginwrapper that is used nowadays is only causing problems. 32-bit plugin-container with 64-bit browser would be a real gain.

Taking into account that we don't (and won't for some time) have 64-bit Flash, 32-bit plugin-container could speed up 64-bit Firefox adoption (mainly on Windows).
Doesn't block since current release plan for FF4 doesn't include 64-bit win

But coming in a dot release soon after?

right; that's the plan.
No it's not. We don't yet have a *plan* to release 64-bit windows builds on any known timeframe.

That's my desire, personally, but it depends very much on the opinions of the guy saying:

Benjamin made the case that the 64-bit OOPP story was too much to contain in FF4. It's clear to me that 64-bit share will only grow over the course of FF4's lifetime, so point release or rapid-follow-on release would be preferable, if a plan can be built around that with acceptable risk characteristics. The risk of NOT doing so is pretty significant, too, imo.
I want to also, but turning that desire into a plan we can execute on needs to wait for resources to come off of a bunch of FF4 blockers.

a 64bit flash player popped up at adobe labs

grab it this time, as long as it lasts
Its not going anywhere.  Adobe plans to ship a fully supported version on its normal release schedule.  If you find issues please use http://bugs.adobe.com/flashplayer to report them.
