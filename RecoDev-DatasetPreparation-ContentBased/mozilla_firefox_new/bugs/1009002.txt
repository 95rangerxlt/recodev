Patch v1

Here's what I did in the patch :
- I converted -moz-image-rects into background-position (so I won't have to rewrite all the rules twice)
- I used ::before for the icon display since otherwise you would see some extra unwanted icon parts
- I added HDPI support for console icons (of course)
- I updated the command line icon to use the new asset included in the zip (lighter in colors and in size)
As far as I checked, there are no regressions. I'm gonna check if there are some alignment issues.

Why am I seeing 'Modified Binary File: browser/themes/shared/devtools/images/commandline-icon.png' here?  Shouldn't that file have stayed the same, but instead added the new browser/themes/shared/devtools/images/commandline-icon@2x.png file?

Ah, fair enough.  Shouldn't there also be a new file added for commandline-icon@2x.png?

FYI this page has easy ways to test all sorts of different console output: https://mihaisucan.github.io/mozilla-work/test.html

Thanks for the tip :) I checked again, and there are no regressions happening.

Looks very good - I will need to go through thoroughly to check each icon type just to make sure we don't have any regressions before r+, but if you make the minor changes suggested then add r=bgrins in the commit message I will take a look.

This width is not used anymore (it is set by the ::before).

I've been moving the background-size stuff into the original rule just as a matter of convention.  Then break the background: rule in the original jsterm-input-node into background-image, background-repeat, background-size just like you did for the message icon.  Then here you can just override background-image.
