Current broken Minefield LTR status bar (screenshot with caption)

Text in Hebrew Minefield apper wrong in the status bar due to the fact that we want it to be LTR for URLs but RTL for Status text "Waiting for...". 

Previous versions has #statusbar-display{
direction: ltr !important;} in intl.css, but this seem to break the status messages.

Moving over a flock of granparadiso RTL bugs to Firefox for triage.
I see that the Persian localization [1] solves this by inserting bidi embedding controls in the localized strings, e.g. 

[RLE]TRANSFERRING DATA FROM [LRE]%1$S[PDF]...[PDF]

Axel, is it possible to mix UTF-8 and escapes (\u202a etc.) in properties files rather than using invisible characters, which make life very difficult when editing?
Unicode escapes still work, and will remain to work in .properties files.
Any solution for this issue, or we'll have to do the same *workaround* the Persians did?
I think the workaround is actually the most practical solution here.
Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).

This is very important fix we should get fixed before going final, as it is visually appear on every request.
I've added /l10n/he/netwerk/necko.properties into the patch of bug 433777 attachment 321801. 

ar people - You might wish to do the same in your locale.

This has been reported in launchpad as well 
https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/234029
fixed and landed for 'he'. 

As Firefox 4 is around the corner, I'd suggest reopening this bug in order to find a better way to do it, as RLE..PDF is not the expected solution.
