When using find as you type I dont see anymore what I am typing in the status bar. 

rv:1.8a, Gecko/20040511 Firefox/0.8.0+

Not 100% sure when this last worked, I think it did in the 9th build.

Regression window is 2004-05-09 Nightly to 2004-05-10 Nightly. Could be another
casualty of Bug 243091?
Confirmed.

- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040512
Firefox/0.8.0+
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Pro 5.00.2195 SP4
This is due to chrome/en-US/locale/en-US/navigator/contents.rdf no longer
existing (presumably from Bug 243091) and thus the package containing the find
as you type strings never being registered.

Since a patch won't apply after Bug 243387 is fixed I won't bother attaching
one. For reference the relevant line to add to the en-US.jar section of
mozilla/browser/extensions/package-fixup/jar.mn is this (I think, WFMs anyway):

* locale/en-US/navigator/contents.rdf
(../../../xpfe/browser/resources/locale/en-US/contents.rdf)

I've added that to my patch in bug 243387.

make typeaheadfind not depend on seamonkey chrome

typeaheadfind is a core component and as such its resources should be packaged
into global, not navigator.

Thanks Ben. Any chance you have skills in the sound arena? They typeaheafind
notfound.wav sound doesn't do Firefox justice, imo.
Appears in the branch, too. Build Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0;
en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040520 Firefox/0.8.0+
Thanks Aaron. No I don't have any special skills with audio but I do have some
ideas for type-ahead-find that might reduce errors. I'm going to file bugs on
them for discussion when I get time. 
Fixed branch and trunk.
