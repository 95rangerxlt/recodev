NSIS 3.0a2 has functionality that I would like to have in Firefox. Specifically, a fix for bug 961958, the ability to specify supportedOS in the executable's manifest, and I am sure other things as well.

Note: Bug 962303 is for adding NSIS 3.0a2 to Mozilla Build.

This compiles and as far as I can tell works as expected. I'll make the configure changes in separate patch.

This is backwards compatible with our current version of NSIS. I'm periodically seeing the compatibility prompt when cancelling and would like to get this landed since I might move forward with getting NSIS 3.0a2 on the build systems to fix that and a few other things.

I'll request review from a build peer as well but I'd like to get your take on these changes.

Pushed the NSIS installer changes to mozilla-inbound since they are backwards compatible and I want to make sure that all is well with them.
