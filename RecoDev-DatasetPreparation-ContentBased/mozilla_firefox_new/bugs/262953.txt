Unfortunately, this agravates the issue with bug 225281 under windows XP with
the default Windows XP theme.  I now get a choice of 2 options but it is rather
difficult to read either one. 
I think this should be backed out for 1.0 unless bug 225281 is fixed. It's just
too ugly. If someone with more clout agrees, 225281 should be set as a dependency.
Added bug 263595 to have the 'revert homepage' default to false.

The text "Use Firefox Start as my Home Page" is a little confusing to
newbies/novices. Italicising _Firefox Start_ might be more clear. The sentence
as-is could be interpreted as having title caps with conflicting verbs "use" and
"start." New users won't know what "Firefox Start" is, so the option is
essentially meaningless anyway.

A better solution, IMHO, would be to scrap this check box. Force "Firefox Start"
on all new installations as the first-run page
(browser.startup.homepage_override does this, right?) loaded from a script that
will immediately pop the "Would you like to set this page as your Home Page"
dialog. If the user clicks No, then the previously set home page will stand.
Nightly users would complain about that just as much as the checkbox behavior
(bug 263595).
The attached code which was committed on Oct 8, introduced a regression.

yeah, I guess that everytime when firefox get's closed the function
'UnregisterDDESupport()' is called and this function deletes reg-keys that
should not be deletet.
These reg keys are:
HKCR\HTTP\shell\open\ddeexec\Application
HKCR\HTTP\shell\open\ddeexec\Topic
HKCR\HTTP\shell\open\ddeexec
HKCR\HTTPS\shell\open\ddeexec\Application
HKCR\HTTPS\shell\open\ddeexec\Topic
HKCR\HTTPS\shell\open\ddeexec
HKCR\FTP\shell\open\ddeexec\Application
HKCR\FTP\shell\open\ddeexec\ifExec
HKCR\FTP\shell\open\ddeexec\Topic
HKCR\FTP\shell\open\ddeexec
HKCR\GOPHER\shell\open\ddeexec\Application
HKCR\GOPHER\shell\open\ddeexec\Topic
HKCR\GOPHER\shell\open\ddeexec
Fixed on trunk by the branch landing.
