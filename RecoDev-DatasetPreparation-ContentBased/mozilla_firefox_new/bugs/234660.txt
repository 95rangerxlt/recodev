Regret updating to latest trunk today:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040217 Firefox/0.8.0+

Keep getting something like below in the JavaScript console. Bookmarks toolbar
and URL bar are also not functional.

Error: gURLBar has no properties

ok figured out what triggers this, seems like Firefox does not like my
about:blank homepage.
Getting the same problem.  Loading Firefox with about:blank as homepage results
in nonfunctional bookmarks (and toolbar) and tabbar.  Using Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040217 Firefox/0.8.0+ (scragz).
Works in 0216 nightly, broken in 0217.


Fixed.


homepage as about:blank gives JavaScript Error: gURLBar has no properties
