Screenshot of bug in dark theme vs. same web page in light theme

STR:
1) Open a tab.
2) Either browse to a URL or type something (search terms, URL, etc.) into the URL bar.

Expected result:
The URL or the entered text is visible in the bar.

Actual result:
The URL or the entered text cannot be seen unless you select it. Looking very closely at where the text should be reveals that it is actually there, just rendered in black.

The placeholder text (the "Search or enter address" message on a new tab) is visible as normal.

I've attached a screenshot so you can see what the problem looks like vs. the working light theme.

fix urlbar inherit to apply on windows,

Ugh, sorry. Either this or adding :-moz-lwtheme to the selector should work, I think (we are currently failing to do the right thing because of https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/099f695d31326c39595264c34988a0f4b7cbc698/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#1239 ).

Yep, I applied this change manually in the browser toolbox, and the problem is gone. Thanks for getting to that so quickly.
