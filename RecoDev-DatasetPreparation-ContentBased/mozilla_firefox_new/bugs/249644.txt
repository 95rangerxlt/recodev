It should be clicking Next 2 times.
And it could be closed bt clicking close button in the chrome.
Works for me.

It doesn't freeze, but no message is given about nothing being available for
import. It just says "The following items are currently being imported..." and
nothing happens. The window can be closed by pressing x though.
