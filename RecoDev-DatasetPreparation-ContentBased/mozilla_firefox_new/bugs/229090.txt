All is in the title.

It breaks since this morning. I grabbed 3 times sources, and bug is present.

See steps below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Grab a 0.8 firebird branch build
2.Update it
3.Launch build process.

Actual Results:  
Breaking in nsAccessibilityService.cpp

Expected Results:  
End building process.

Here is the log when building is killed :

[more than 13000 lines of good work after typing make -f client.mk build]

It seems to be related to firebird trunk checkin for bug #227690.

How can this checkin gets in 0.8 branch ?

Reversing patch #2 from bug 227690 (attachment 137217) doesn't seem to cure the
bug ?!

Disregard previous comment. It seems I misapplied patch :[

So, reversing patch in previous comment kills the bug. Sorry for spamming :[
Sounds like Firebird is pulling accessibility but didn't bother to tag it...
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?subdir=mozilla&files=client.mk&command=DIRECTORY&branch=FIREBIRD_0_8_BRANCH&root=/cvsroot

this probably fixed this issue, can you please retest building now?
Mark it as FIXED, please. I release builds using the patch.

See http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=42189 (build was made using
23rd december source code).

Fixed on branch
