The about:support troubleshooting information doesn't include the middle mouse button preferences, which has been a problem for users troubleshooting why autoscrolling or mousewheel scrolling/zooming are not working.

The preferences that should be added are:
mousewheel.* (currently whitelisted incorrectly as browser.mousewheel.*)
general.autoScroll

Other preferences that are missing:
permissions.default.image (controls when images are displayed on web sites)
browser.display.* (controls whether colors and background images are used)
services.sync.* (controls whether preferences are synced via Firefox Sync)
Nice to have, and AIUI can also be added in a stability and support release. Not a blocker for Firefox 4.

patch

This patch changes the order of the preferences so that it's alphabetical,
changes browser.mousewheel to mousewheel and adds all the proposed preferences to the whitelist

patch v2

services.sync.* includes tons of private information (lastSyncTime, "GUID", clusterURL, etc.), so we shouldn't include it here. If there are things there that need to be specifically included we can do that. The other changes look fine.

patch v3

v3, excluding services.sync. 

I suppose we can decide on what sync preferences to include later. But for now, this should be everything.
Can someone check this in, please?
Please could you tweak your hgrc to automatically add author info (guide here: http://blog.bonardo.net/2010/06/22/so-youre-about-to-use-checkin-needed) + add a commit message when attaching patches, since it makes pushing half a dozen checkin-neededs a lot easier. Thanks :-)
Made the comment 9 changes in the end, just so this manages to make Firefox 10, for SUMO's sake.
