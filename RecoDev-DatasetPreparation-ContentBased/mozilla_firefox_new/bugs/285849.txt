Tools->Options->Content->Advanced (in the Fonts & Colors section) does not list
system setting for OS/2. For proper font sizes under OS/2,
browser.display.screen_resolution should also be set to 0 (= system setting) by
default. This is already set correctly in all.js and does not need to be
specified in firefox.js.

This lets the preprocessor keep the system setting option for Unix (not MacOSX)
and OS/2.

filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


System setting screen resolution is missing and not default
