1) This bug is about the uninstaller
2) Last I checked Pacifica didn't build with VC8.  That may have changed, though.

Either way if you can reproduce that you should file a new bug and include a URL to download an installer that shows this bug.

Every time I try to move to latest Thebes from my Pacifica, I have many crashes (that's another issue).  But when I come back to Pacifica, I have to uninstall Thebes, and at that moment I got this uninstaller issue.


Rob, which uninstaller are we using now on trunk?
We use the one from NSIS though I haven't removed uninstall.exe yet due to update and the new uninstaller is not getting diffed yet either. So, this should be good to go except for people that just use software update.
The patch in bug 349551 will fix this.
The patch in bug 349551 has landed on the trunk and tomorrow's software update will include the uninstaller so resolving -> fixed.
