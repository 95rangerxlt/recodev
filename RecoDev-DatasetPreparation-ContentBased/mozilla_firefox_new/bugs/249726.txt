WFM with 0.9.1 on XP
Further testing has revealed this does not happen with every web page, so change
step one in the instructions to reproduce the bug to:

Visit the URL http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/
I neglected to mention that you also need to have the preference
javascript.options.showInConsole set to true in order to have chrome JavaScript
errors show up in the JavaScript Console window otherwise you will not see this
problem.

Sorry for the bugspam.  Should have had my info more in order before posting the
first time.
with the preference
javascript.options.showInConsole set to true, I've seen those javascript errors
when viewing page info on every page with meta data with both Firefox 0.9.2 on
windows and Firefox 0.9.3 on Mandrake 9.2.
It seems to be the same bug that bug 183185 which as been fixed in seamonkey.

Florian: when asking for review, make sure to ask for someone in particular. 
Hopefully mconnor doesn't kill me for this ;)
No major side-effect other than that there are errors? -.

> No major side-effect other than that there are errors? -.

In page info (if page contains meta data) in general tab in "meta:" there are as
many blank lines as there are lines with data.

Same problem in "Fields:" in form tab if the webpage contains form(s).

Javascript errors are caused by these blank lines in page info, when page info
loads, and each time the user click on a blank line.

These blank lines are a visible side-effect of this bug.

It's a firefox bug; it needs review from firefox folks.  I certainly don't
count.	I'm pretty sure that db48x doesn't count either.
I may not count, but that is the correct way to fix the problem.
