This problem is caused by Bug 407956.
So, the addon should be modified.
Wladimir - do you accept Mozilla bugs?
I do. I was looking into that issue already - thank you for tracking down the relevant API change.
Fixed:
https://hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplus/rev/083875fc8475
https://hg.adblockplus.org/abpwatcher/rev/a0a73f6e3696

The corresponding releases should be out by next Tuesday.
Adblock Plus 2.2.4 and Diagnostics 1.2.4 for Adblock Plus were released yesterday, that issue should be gone in both.

Wladimir, do you know if the new style of the checkboxes on the right is normal after your modification?
The checkbox style was always like that. Firefox doesn't style checkboxes in a tree widget at all, so you cannot have native styling. Adblock Plus uses checkbox images that look ok-ish on all platforms but don't match the native widgets on any platform of course.

Untracking given this. Thanks Wladimir.
