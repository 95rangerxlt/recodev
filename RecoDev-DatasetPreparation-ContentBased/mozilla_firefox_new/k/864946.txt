The default snippets that run when the service is down are using webtrends tags.  Can we update those with GA?  

I can't see the add-on snippet at the moment, but I believe the other snippet links to the feature page.  I created a GA link for you.  The add-ons will need a GA link as well.  

Feature default snippet GA link:
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/?utm_source=snippet&amp;utm_medium=snippet&amp;utm_campaign=default+feature+snippet

Feature default snippet GA link:
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/?utm_source=snippet&amp;utm_medium=snippet&amp;utm_campaign=default+feature+snippet
The two current URLs being used are:

http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/features/?WT.mc_ID=default1
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/?src=snippet&WT.mc_ID=default2

I'll change the first one to

http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/features/?utm_source=snippet&amp;utm_medium=snippet&amp;utm_campaign=default+feature+snippet

What should the second one be?

I've got mozilla-central set up locally and I've successfully changed the URLs. Once I make the change and have a patch I'll move this over to the right component and get someone to review/commit my changes.
Thanks.  Add-ons link would be:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/?utm_source=snippet&amp;utm_medium=snippet&amp;utm_campaign=addons

fryn: Let me know if I did something wrong and what else I need to do to get this merged, I've never touched the browser before. :D

Do we actually want the mozilla.com to mozilla.org redirect?

Clearly I am not on my A-game today. I've tested both the URLs to ensure only an l10n redirect happens. Hopefully I haven't missed anything again. :D
