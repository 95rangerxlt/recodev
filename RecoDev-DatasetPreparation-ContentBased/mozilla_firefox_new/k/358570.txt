Using OpenSearch without <inputEncoding>, the query characters are garbled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://ja.wikipedia.org/
2. Add the Search Engine Wikipedia provides.
3. Search Japanese words(e.x. &#26085;&#26412;&#35486;) using it.

Actual Results:  
The query characters are garbled. So I can't search correctly.

Expected Results:  
The query characters aren't garbled. And I cant search correctly.

When the OpenSearch plugin doesn't contain <inputEncoding>, Firefox uses intl.charset.default as encoding.
Thd default value of intl.charset.default is ISO-8859-1. So "&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;" is encoded %3F%3F%3F.

According to OpenSearch 1.1, however, the default value of <inputEncoding> is "UTF-8".
http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#The_.22InputEncoding.22_element
# "&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;" should be encoded %E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E.

So, Firefox should use UTF-8 encoding even if <inputEncoding> isn't contained by the OpenSearch plugin.

FYI, IE7 uses UTF-8 encoding even if <inputEncoding> isn't contained by the OpenSearch plugin.

I express thanks to your review. Now, I would like your check in.
Checked in on the trunk.

what I checked in
This patch would be safe enough for the 1.8 (Firefox 2) branch if you think it's an important enough bug to fix.
So, could you check in to Branch 1.8.1?

I just gave you the ability to confirm and edit bugs, so you should be able to request approval-1.8.1.1 on the patch. The bug resolution reflects the status on the trunk, so it should remain FIXED.

approved for 1.8 branch, a=dveditz for drivers

I'm unable to reproduce the problem on the trunk version where the problem was found (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061029 Minefield/3.0a1); and I am unable to reproduce the problem 2.0 builds. The search for (&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;) returns a page that doesn't look great on trunk but looks OK on 2.0. The URL looks like this: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E

Takeshi, could you take a look and verify this bug fix?
