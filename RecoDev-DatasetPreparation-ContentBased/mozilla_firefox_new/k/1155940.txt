The patch for bug 1063369 (which I would like to land) turns browser_354894_perwindowpb.js orange. After some experimenting on try server this appears to be because we don't wait for undeCloseTab to finish loading the window and it's in some half restored state, which confuses the new window creation that happens next. I don't claim to understand exactly what is going on, but waiting for undeCloseTab to finish seems to be the correct thing to do.

Please don't use arguments.callee but name the function instead.
