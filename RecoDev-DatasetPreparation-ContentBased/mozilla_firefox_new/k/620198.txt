*** Bug 624516 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I'm guessing status2.0? wasn't meant to be set but blocking2.0? was.
Blocking+ on this regression. We can't trade perf for brokenness.
Noticing some weird behaviour with this.
After deleting a bookmarks folder with more than 5 items from the left pane (more than 5 so it causes a transaction batch), selecting other bookmarks folders in the left pane will not cause the right side UI to update.

However, when the Library loses focus the right side UI will update.

I've been trying to track it down in the front end UI but haven't made much progress. I think some UI thinks a batching is still going on but haven't able to confirm this. Also seems a bit similar to bug 617956.
It seems that the result observer for the right hand side is not being notified during OnEndUpdateBatch. My first guess was to hook up nsNavHistory::StopObserving to nsNavHistory::OnEndUpdateBatch but this did not help.

Not sure how to proceed.
Thanks, I'll take a look if I can figure it out, if you want to work on other blockers feel free to reassign to me.
Stealing since this is a bit more complicated than I expected, I have a fix but it's not exactly what I was expecting.

I don't like the fix so much, but rethinking to it, it's the simplest and less regression-prone thing I can do without touching APIs. This also fixes Bug 394353 since I was testing this bug in the library with tags. Both fixes have tests.

The problem is that the right pane gets replaced when the left pane ends its batch, the replacement tree end up being out of sync due to the tree batch. Fixing it in result code would mixup things too much at this stage.

it's not, as I wrote in comment 13 I was testing tags to check for this bug fix, and I ended up fixing Bug 394353. I can split them, I did not do at first since the fix was pretty small, but it's easy to do.

follow-up for a permaorange in the test, a previous test was not removing its bookmark, after checking the cleanup worked, I also made the uri unique to better identify it.
