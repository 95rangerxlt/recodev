browserid_identity sets up logging in the BrowserIDManager() constructor.  Normally this isn't a problem as there is normally only 1 instance created.  However, the tests cause multiple instances to be created, and this causes a new DumpAppender to be created each time, which in turn causes a duplication of log messages each test run.

This patch makes "log" a module-level lazy attribute.  The instance still initializes this._log to log.

Every instance of browserid_identity creates a new DumpAppender
