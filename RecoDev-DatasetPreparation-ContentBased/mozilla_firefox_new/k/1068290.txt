Add ability to highlight New Private Window icon in chrome. For this tour, icon will be highlighted if icon exists in toolbar or menu panel. 

If icon doesn't exist in either because the user has moved it into the palette, step in tour will still be shown, but highlight/icon location will not be indicated. In the future we may need to consider conditional cases, where if an icon is not in toolbar or menu panel, we will omit the step all-together. For the sake of this step and tour, however, we will show to all users.

Patch v.1

This is exactly the same as what bug 1045927 added for the Hello button.

Checked that the test passes, and that Mozilla.UITour.showHilight("privateWin") actually works.

Nit: part of using this target map is to allow us to give targets nicer names for API users. With that in mind, I would prefer we don't truncate this target name and use "privateWindow". I realize the indentation will differ for this line but I think that's less of an issue.

I think that as long as it's only the ability and no tour that actually highlights it has been implemented, we cannot manually test it.

Patch v.2

a+ for beta as this bug will be landing in the 33.x anniversary release. (It's already on Nightly + Aurora, so only needs a beta landing at this point.)
