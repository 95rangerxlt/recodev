The NSS update from bug 1137470 increased NSS's default maximum supported version of TLS from 1.0 to 1.2, which caused http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/netmonitor/test/browser_net_security-details.js#40 to fail because it expects exactly a TLSv1 connection without having done anything to ensure it gets one.

I'll land a change to increase that to expecting exactly a TLSv1.2 connection once I have the number from this bug to use in a commit message, but the test really needs to do something else, either ensure that it will get a particular version or not test that it has gotten a particular version.

We'll also need this on Aurora, because 3.18 RTM will have to land there.
You can land test-only changes on aurora with a=test-only, no need to worry about that.

Here's a patch that makes the test work with different TLS protocol versions and cipher suites. It changes the test not to assume any specific values but to check if the values look valid i.e. the protocol version starts with "TLS" and the cipher suite starts with "TLS_".

This should be quite a bit more future proof.

browser_net_security-details.js failure from the NSS 3.18 RC0 landing



Bug 1140739 - Adjust browser_net_security-details.js's expectation of the label for a TLSv1.2 connection following the bug 1137470 NSS 3.18RC0 update's increase of the default maximum enabled TLS version

Bug 1140739 - Don't expect any specific TLS version or cipher suite in browser_net_security-details.js. r=vporof
