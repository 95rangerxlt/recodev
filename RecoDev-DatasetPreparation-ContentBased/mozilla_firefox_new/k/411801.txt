err, that should be 3.0a5... but you get the idea. :)
IE-TAB works with the beta's.
But you need to change the max-version number in the install files.
The install-package is a ZIP file. Open it, find the text-install-file
and find the max-version parameter for Firefox. Set it higher.
I've tested all of IEtab's functionality. Almost everything works. Here is some of the things I tested and found does work (or doesn't work, but it's the expected result) :

Opening in IE Tab/External Application
Opening IE only websites in IE Tab/External Application
Opening up Firefox chrome:// and about: pages in IE
Session restore on IE tab
Ctrl-click on IE Tab to open in external app
Options - All of Sites filter
Options - All of General Settings
Options - Context Menu - Tabbar Tabs and Content Area
Opening pages in IE that need Firefox cookies

However, two maybe problems with the extension are :

It leaks, bug 420227
Under Options - Context Menu - Personal Bookmarks context menu. This doesn't seem to do anything. I expect to be able to right-click on my bookmarks and open in an IE tab, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Or I can just be misunderstanding it.
Wow, that's great!! Few questions...

Is that how it works with Firefox 2?

I checked and yes. If you right-click on a bookmark from the Bookmarks menu, the context menu shows IE tab in Firefox 2.

OK. So we do have a bug. Do you think you would tinker with the extension and see if you can make it work?


great work cesar!   given the findings I think we should go ahead and owner being AWOL so far I think we should go ahead and flip the max version and get this in the hands for fx3 b4 testers.  that might also help to shake out problems if there are any.
I read this to fast thinking that there was no regression.  Guessing that updates might be needed for this to be compat with new bookmark system for this one feature of the extension to work.  Maybe finkle knows if its an easy flipping of an api.   

Since this one bug doesn't crash or get in the way of other functionally it still might be worth flipping the max version and getting to some subset of the half million b4 users, then make the harder call at the next beta's or rc's on if we should flip max version again.

Will do. I might as well assign the bug to myself in case I do fix it :)
The main problems are:
* The "bookmarks-context-menu" popupmenu has been changed to "placesContext" in Fx3. So the extension can't add its menu items to the context menu.

* The extension uses the BookmarkUtils code to determine if the user right clicked on a bookmark or on empty space. This needs to use the PlacesUtils object instead. Example here http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/places/content/controller.js#128

Is it possible to make these changes and still provide Fx2 compatibility? Thanks for the pointers...

Sure. The code in IeTab.prototype.addBookmarkMenuitem [1] just returns if it can't find the Fx2 context menu. Change that code to look for both context menus. Use the existing code for Fx2 menu and the new code for Fx3 menu.

Firefox3 working patch

This patch breaks firefox2, but seems to be working on firefox3. I will get Fx2 working after some sleep.
Hi all,
I apologize for the late in replying and any inconvenience caused.
I've provided a new IETAB1.5.20080301 for FX3.0b3+ testing purpose.

You can download the test version from the following URL:
http://forum.moztw.org/files/ietab-1.5.20080301-devbuild_193.xpi

If there is still any compatible problem with FX3.0, please feel free let me know.
Thank you.
Welcome back!

The link is broken now, but I managed to grab it before it went down. There seems to be one problem, when I right-click a non-bookmark from the bookmark menu, I get an Assertion failure popup (it is not in the error console). Other than that, the bookmarks menu works as it did in Firefox 2.

BTW, are we looking to have ietab work in both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3? The new code changes seems to be Firefox 3 only, but I may be rushing the process here.

Thanks
Hello cesar,
Thanks for the bug report, I've already fixed the assertion failure popup problem.

I'll release the further DevBuild on the MozTW forum.
http://forum.moztw.org/viewtopic.php?t=11081
(You can get the 1.5 DevBuild download link on page bottom.)

For now, the 1.5 version is only for FX3 compatibility.
There is no feature improvement.

Thank you.

Thanks for the update!

I tested IE tab again. The bookmarks works now, so great job getting it out so fast.

I found one small bug that I didn't catch before. If you bookmark a page that is in IE rendering mode, the bookmark works unless you try opening it in External App (it gets passed chrome://ietab/.../reloaded.html?=http://example.com, which is valid in Firefox but not IE).

I don't think this small bug should get in the way of resolving this fixed, but I'm not the one to make that decision. Polvi? Hofmann?
Hi cesar, 
Thanks for the Comment #18 bug report.
I've fixed it on v1.5.20080307.
Thank you.
all sounds good to me.  we should try and get this live as soon as possible so fx3 beta 4 testers can use it....
I also wanted to point out that you can put your updated add-on in the sandbox for testers to pick up. Then, once you are ready, you will just have to push the update to the review queue for public consumption.
Hi Alex,
Thanks for the point out. 
I've push the latest version to the AMO add-ons sandbox. 
Thank you.

Hi all,
If you want to be the tester of the new 1.5 version for Firefox 3, you can login AMO to get it.
looks like it is ready on AMO. thanks!
