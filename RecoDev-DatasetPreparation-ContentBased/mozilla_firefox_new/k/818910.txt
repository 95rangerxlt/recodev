1. Open the browser and activate the developer toolbar.
2. Open a new browser window.
3. Close the new window.
4. Type help <enter> in the command line.
5. The message "TypeError: this._panel.openPopup is not a function" will be displayed.
6. Close the browser.

Some items will leak. This is because the second command line overwrites items in the first. To stop leaks in this situation the command lines first need to be separated and then we need to destroy the command line in the new window when it is closed.

I am not sure, but Joe may be the best one to take a look into this.
