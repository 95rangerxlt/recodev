Sample distribution/distribution.ini file highlighting issue

Bookmark items with an id number of two digits or more are ignored by the distribution.js module. Bookmark items with an id number of one digit are parsed and added properly. The issue applies to both bookmark toolbar entries and bookmark menu entries.

Attached is a sample distribution.ini file that contains three bookmark toolbar items, one with an item number of "1", one with an item number of "10", and one with an item number of "100". Only the bookmark with an item number of "1" is added to the toolbar.

Patch to ensure iid comparison is int to int

because Gavin is awesome, he pointed out to me today that there was a string vs. int comparison issue. editing line 157 of distribution.js such that it reads:

   if (maxItemId < parseInt(iid))

seems to do the trick nicely.

thunder, could you have a look and verify that's all that needs to be done to the file?

Patch to ensure iid comparison is int to int

Holy cow, I'd forgotten about this bug.  Indeed, interpreting those as strings would be trouble.  I didn't realize that /(\d+)/ would end up giving me a string (boo).

I just skimmed distribution.js:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/distribution.js?force=1

And it looks like the only instance of this bug there.

r+ as far as I'm concerned
Excellent. Need this added to 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and Central. Who should be cc'd for review and landing?

you already have review. i can land this on central, then you just need to ask approvals.
That'd be great, Marco. Thanks.

once got a green you're clear to ask approval for branches.
Thanks Marco!

Patch to ensure iid comparison is int to int

Hmm, actually, this patch isn't quite ideal, since iid is still being assigned to maxItemId as a string, so you're still relying on implicit conversion (just in the opposite direction - maxItemId to an int). Would be cleaner to just set iid = parseInt(iid) right after it's assigned to, I think.

Revised update to address comment #8

Per Gavin's comment #8, revised the patch to set iid = parseInt(iid) after assignment.
Marco, can you back out the old patch?

I'll undo the previous change once i push the new patch, in a single push.
backout: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b439b81118a6
push: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2f0b9d7d8c56
Asking for acceptance into 1.9.1.next and 1.9.2.next, as it addresses a long-standing bug with existing partner repacks that have more than 10 items in a bookmark folder as part of their customizations. Would also like to ensure this is included in any future releases.

Thanks!
Definitely wanted; if those patches are safe, can we get them nominated for the appropriate branches?

Yes, the patch is safe enough, just a string->int cast.
