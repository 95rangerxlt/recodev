Hello Firefox-Team,

since some nightly-builds of Minefield there is a little problem back: 

The right corner at the bottom to resize the window is overlapping the Scrollbar-Arrow, after selecting "Hide Status Bar".

Thanks and regards
Mehmet

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "Hide the Status Bar" from the Minefield-Menu

Actual Results:  
The right corner at the bottom to resize the window is overlapping the Scrollbar-Arrow.

Expected Results:  
This should not happen!

You mean you didn't get at least two compiler warnings for this mistake? ;-)
