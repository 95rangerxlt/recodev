Currently the count on the Developer toolbar only shows the count for JavaScript errors. It is not obvious that is what it is for so a tooltip would be great!

Yes.
Cool. I was wondering if i can pick this up for my school project. We need to submit a fix and get it approved on a open source project. If i can tackle this thatll be great.

Come to IRC (irc.mozilla.org #devtools). Myself and msucan will be able to help you.
Tyrone: thanks for your interest in this bug.

Overview of the workflow:

1. Get the firefox source:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial

2. Build firefox:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build

3. Make a patch:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Creating_a_patch

4. Submit the patch:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/How_to_Submit_a_Patch


If you read through the source code about something you do not know about, you may find documentation here:

1. Mozilla Developer Network - has a ton of info about XUL elements, HTML, JS, DOM, Gecko-specific APIs and more.

http://developer.mozilla.org/

2. MXR (Mozilla Cross-Reference) is a source code search engine - search for symbols you want to learn about, eg. nsIDocument.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/

3. DXR is a smart source code search tool, similar to MXR but better.

http://dxr.mozilla.org


Here's an overview of how you can fix this bug:

1. The developer toolbar is implemented in browser/devtools/shared/DeveloperToolbar.jsm.

2. The toolbar UI is in browser/base/content/browser.xul - search for id="developer-toolbar".

3. The error counter can be found in DeveloperToolbar.jsm - search for the _updateErrorsCount() method.

4. The _errorCounterButton element is #developer-toolbar-toolbox-button from browser.xul.

5. You just need to update the button tooltiptext in _updateErrorsCount().

Please let us know if you have further questions. Thanks!
I'll build it right now. How do i assign this bug to me?
Assigned.
Hey,

I can't seem to see any error counts for Javascript. I successfully build the project and I made sure my changes get updated(edited a javascript file to see if my changes apply, and it does get applied). When I edited .jsm and .xul file do I have to build the project for the changes to get applied?

Yes. You need to rebuild. But not everything. Just the browser/devtools directory. In your obj dir, do: "make -C obj/browser/devtools" (the obj directory might be named differently depending on how you built Firefox).
Hey is there a specific text you want
Hey Paul, Mihai,

Is there any specific text we should put into the tooltip? Let me know thanks.
Maybe something like:

3 errors, 10 warnings

Mihai, do you think that covers correctly the information we have?

> Mihai, do you think that covers correctly the information we have?

Yes, but then Tyrone has to make a small change to also count the warnings. If he can do that, that's great. Otherwise just showing "N errors" is fine.

Also note that this is a toolbox toggle button. The tooltip should also include something to that effect. "N errors, M warnings. Click to open the developer toolbox." or something else.
Sure I can try to add the warning count. I'm assuming I have to initiate a _warningsCount and do everything similar to how the errorCount is set up. I'm trying to find the global _errorCount. Is that in another file?
As of right now I have it showing up as..

'N errors. Click to open developer toolbox.'
Hey Mihai and Paul,

I was able to get the warning count also. I used a site with warning messages on there to test if its working correctly and it seems like it is :)

Thanks for your patch Tyrone! This is looking good.

Just a few comments below for improvements.

Paul: Tyrone needs to add a new string. Where should he do it? Can he reuse toolbox.properties or do we want a new toolbar.properties?

I suggest you put the warnings count reset in the condition above - so if tabId in _errorsCount, then you can safely do warningsCount[tabId] = 0 without checking for the existence of tabId in _warningsCount. Also, you don't need to call _updateErrorsCount() twice.
Tyrone: I asked Joe Walker about where would be the best place for you to add the new string (Paul is currently away): the conclusion we came to is that you best add the new string to the toolbox.properties (use |hg locate| to find its location in the codebase).

This approach doesn't make the tooltip fully translatable into other languages.

Please put the entire string in the properties file and use formatStringFromName(). Learn more here:

Why not:

  this._warningsCount[tabId] = 0;
  this._errorsCount[tabId] = 0;

Once you do this the button will no longer have any tooltip, not even the default one.

Before you change the tooltiptext, there's a default tooltiptext in the XUL.

Click to toggle the developer tools.
Hey Mihai,

Are you on at this time by anychance? If not. Whats a good way to deal with that should I set the tooltiptext back to "Click to toggle developer tools."? Or is there a way to set it back?

-Tyrone
I was thinking about getting the defaultTooltipText when developer tool loads? then save that globally?
