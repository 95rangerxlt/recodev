This was meant to accommodate to the location bar's border-radius, but that border-radius is only 1px now which means that the inner edge of the border is pretty much rectangular. So the identity box should be rectangular too.

Note that this is only visible in popup windows.

Hi :dao, I am interested in this bug. Could I work on it? I have submitted a patch earlier but it hasn't been approved as yet. It wasn't mentored either.
