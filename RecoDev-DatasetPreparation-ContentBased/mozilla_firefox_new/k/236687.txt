Ah, another bug noone seems to care about. Anyway, the fault is in
nsOperaProfileMigrator.cpp 

Those defines are just done for XP, MacOS X and UNIX. No defaults :(

I'll just force a 
#elif defined (XP_BEOS)
#define OPERA_PREFERENCES_FOLDER_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING(".opera")
#define OPERA_PREFERENCES_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("opera6.ini")
#define OPERA_HISTORY_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("global.dat")
#define OPERA_BOOKMARKS_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("opera6.adr")
#endif

Thanks for supporting your patches. Btw, it is nice with fallback defaults.
Switching to BLOCKER now that it's a confirmed bug and it breaks build. Fix in
comment already, but I don't know the real values for Opera under BeOS.
I have Opera 3.62 for BeOS installed and the values are:

#define OPERA_PREFERENCES_FOLDER_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("Opera")
#define OPERA_PREFERENCES_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("opera.ini")
#define OPERA_HISTORY_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("global.dat")
#define OPERA_BOOKMARKS_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("Opera Default Bookmarks.adr")

Adds BeOS defines

Real bookmarks file (analog of Opera6.adr) has name "opera.adr", not "Opera
Default Bookmarks.adr".

Second one gets imported into opera.adr at first launch. 
If we consider here just migration, no sense to import (only defaults).

Besides this issue, patch looks OK.
Strange...
When I add a new bookmark, it's get added to the "Opera Default Bookmarks.adr"-file. The 
"opera.adr"-file is never created.
It might be this specific installation, because a previous installation under BeOS 4.5.2 
does have a "opera.adr"-file but no "Opera Default Bookmarks.adr"-file.
Another one:

#define OPERA_COOKIES_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("cookies4.dat")
Should be (on BeOS):
#define OPERA_COOKIES_FILE_NAME NS_LITERAL_STRING("cookies.dat")

Defines OPERA_COOKIES_FILE_NAME as Jeroen suggests for BeOS with old value as
fallback if it's not defined.

Now OK
r=sergei_d@fi.tartu.ee

Now you should set sr request (fome some of this module owners)
heh, that's right...we are forced to use some measure to avoid redifinition of
our ancient Opera cookie-file name.
Though, are you sure if it is beter to use ifndef not ifdef/elif/endif? 
I think in this question you should consult with module owners, to avoid "-" on sr.

need sr (and someone to commit on success).

This allows FireFox to build on BeOS again.

The tree has been broken for a long time now, so changing sr.

Brian, could you please sr (and commit on success)?

There is no Opera for BeOS, correct?  So I think the correct fix is to ifdef it
in the Makefile.in and in browser/components/build/nsModule.cpp.

Yes there is, even if it's not up to date. Don't know the exact version, but the
files pointed out by defines should be correct. I don't have Opera and I don't
think it's a free download for BeOS.

Ok, my bad, I looked on http://www.opera.com/products/ and didn't see it
listed.  In that case, the patch is fine.
Could someone commit this? I don't have access.
