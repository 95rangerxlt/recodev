Final version of MacIE was released as 2003 and there is no Intel version release.

Also, target platform of Firefox trunk is Intel version and OSX 10.5 or later.  I think that MacIE migratory doesn't need.

Indeed, most of the migration code is crufty, old, and no longer useful. Removing MacIE would be a good start, and if you're motivated to purge some of the others that would be great too!

At least, no one needs old Phoenix migration.  I will file a new bug for it.
I guess ICab OmniWeb and Dogbert can go as well.
I'm available to review if browser peers are fine with that.
We should remove iCab, OmniWeb and Camino migration because this implementation is template only and commented in XUL.  So, it doesn't work.

I've done some search in mxr and looks like you removed all the relations, nice!

why this isolated change in the Opera migrator?

If nothing, it will causes build break (http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Try/1305523324.1305528492.5285.gz) when compiling nsModule.cpp.
Ah, I see.
OperaProfileMigrator.cpp includes nsIStringBundle.h before its own header
62 #include "nsIStringBundle.h"
63 #include "nsISupportsPrimitives.h"
64 #include "nsNetUtil.h"
65 #include "nsOperaProfileMigrator.h"
Instead in nsModule.cpp we include only the header and nsIStringBundle.h was included by a previous migrator header that you removed.
The trybuild was a really good idea! :)
