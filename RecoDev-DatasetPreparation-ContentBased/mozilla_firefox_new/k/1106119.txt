the getLocale() function doesn't take in account neither the intl.locale.matchOS preference nor the -UILocale command-line parameter to determine the current locale. With it the wrong hyphenation rules can be applied to the labels of the toolbar buttons inside the menu panel.

Steps to reproduce:
* Ensure the general.useragent.locale pref is set to "en-US"
* Install the es-ES langpack
* Close Firefox, and start it with the -UILocale flag
    ./firefox -UILocale es-ES
* You get the UI in Spanish, but the label of the Sidebars button is "Barras lat- erales" (wrong) instead of "Barras latera- les".

Add support for the intl.locale.matchOS preference is a direct thing, but, as far as I understand the implementation code of the nsChromeRegistryChrome interface, it's not possible to know directly the  locale set initially with -UILocale. Maybe is better to have a new more general bug about the latter.

Are you saying that the chrome registry's locale for package thing doesn't reflect the -UILocale switch? So if I start Firefox with a profile where the general.useragent.locale pref is fr-FR, but I pass -UILocale es-ES and I ask:

chromeRegistry.getSelectedLocale("browser");

it will return fr-FR instead of es-ES ?
No, getSelectedLocale() from the chrome registry works as expected, but here the direct value of the preferred locale is set for the menu panel, not caring about its availability, causing then a mismatch. 

Actually, there are at least two diferent cases where the current situation can go wrong:

 - When the application locale happens to be determined from *general.useragent.locale*, but it corresponds to an unavailable locale: chromeRegistry returns whatever locale is available, locale that is finally used for the browser, but the menu panel have set the original unavailable locale --> wrong hyphenation rules.
 - When the locale is determined from -UILocale (or intl.locale.matchOS): chromeRegistry returns that locale, as expected, that is used for the browser, but the menu panel have set the value of *general.useragent.locale* --> wrong hyphenation rules again.

It seems that using directly the value returned by the chrome registry could help here; my comment 1 was about the impossibility of knowing the exact value specified with -UILocale (when it turned out to correspond to an unavailable locale); something that I like to see available but probably not required here.
Right, so both issues could be fixed by asking the chrome registry instead of relying directly on the pref. Great!

LGTM - just one suggestion. Thanks Gijs!

Looks like nsChromeRegistryChrome::GetSelectedLocale can return failure nsresults, which will throw here.

Can we keep the try/catch and return en-US in that case?
