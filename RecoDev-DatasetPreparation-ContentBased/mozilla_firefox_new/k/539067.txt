xpcshell timed out before running any check in this test.
Since for now any try to debug these failures has failed, i'm going to disable the test till we have a way to reproduce locally (record and replay env?), or a possible patch, known reason.

this cleanups and re-enables test_browserGlue_prefs.js.
The nsBrowserGlue.js change requires proper review, but it's a piece of code used only by tests.
