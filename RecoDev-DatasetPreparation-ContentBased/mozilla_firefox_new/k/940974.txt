Are you moving add-on icons? What about the builtin widgets, do those persist? So far we've only seen problems with add-ons that restore their icons to their default locations after a restart.
None of them persist. I've tried to put Subscribe, Developer icons on the menu, also icons of WebDeveloper extension, without luck.

This is very strange. Can you reproduce on an empty profile or in safe mode? We just write stuff to the prefs file, so it sounds like somehow preferences aren't being saved correctly.
I restarted in safe-mode twice, doing the Customizations in-between. Icons of widgets have survived, thanks. 

However, still no luck with add-on icons.

Can you detail which add-ons these are?

I seem to be experiencing exactly this, too.  I'm on the 20th's nightly (20131120062258) on Windows 7.  After restarting Firefox, any toolbar modifications didn't save.  Starting in safe mode did allow me to modify the default widgets.  I can modify the default widgets in a new profile as well.

The addons I have with toolbar buttons are ABP, Pano, Cookie Manager, and Scriptish.
I had some customization revert after a restart:

I had previously moved the Developer button to my toolbar.  I then moved the search bar, developer button, and downloads button to the popup.  

I also have on addon button (OnePassword) that I can't remember if I decided to leave on the toolbar or put in the popup.

After a quit/restart my most recent customizations had been reverted, but the Developer button was still on the toolbar.
So, the weirdest about all of these reports is that it seems like somehow the add-ons are also impacting whether normal icons get saved correctly.

This is strange because we just write to prefs to save all this info, so I don't see how any add-ons would interfere with this. If we had consistent steps to reproduce from a clean profile, that would be very helpful in figuring out what is going on here.

The add-ons themselves not saving their positions correctly is generally because the add-ons have custom-written code that inserts themselves into a toolbar if they don't exist somewhere. So you remove them, and they go "hey, my icon is gone" and go and add themselves to the toolbar again. That's wrong, but there's not really anything we can do against that.

I'm confirming this because it's clear that enough people are running into this that it's a real issue, even if it might be (partly?) caused by add-ons.
Note that if you can reproduce this with builtin icons on your regular profile, it'd probably be helpful if you checked the browser console (ctrl-shift-j on windows) to see if there are any errors that show up there.

I tried adding a default widget to my toolbar and the console reported the following:

Error finding I: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIStringBundle.GetStringFromName]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/ShortcutUtils.jsm :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 88"  data: no] ShortcutUtils.jsm:90

When I removed it, I received a different error that mentioned one of my user scripts in Scriptish.  I removed the script and Firefox will now remember what I do to default widgets.  Unfortunately, I didn't copy the second error, but it was complaining about the script referring to an undefined function.  Even more unfortunate is that I don't know which script it was now that I removed it.

Do you still have the script so you can re-add it? :-)

As for the first error, that's unrelated, but I've been meaning to file that for like forever, so thank you for reminding me!

(in the meantime, this is going to be a P1 because we need to get this sorted)

> Do you still have the script so you can re-add it? :-)

I don't think so.  I wasn't the author.  In my profile, it's not next to the other user scripts still installed.  I don't know if traces of it might be sitting around somewhere in my profile.

If it helps any, the function in the error message was, I think, "GM_info".  That identifier doesn't show up on MXR, but Google says Greasemonkey's API has a function of that name and that Scriptish doesn't implement it.

Yeah, it's a greasemonkey thing. https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/blob/master/modules/script.js#L455

I don't see anything in there that'd obviously spectacularly start failing, but then again, we don't know what the script did.

At the minute we probably need more info as to stuff that breaks (other than SDK add-ons, where we'll still waiting on an SDK uplift - although they shouldn't affect the rest of your customizations being saved). :-(
Gijs, did you intend to needinfo a specific person?
Not really; this bug isn't really actionable without more specific STR. I'll try to reproduce with the add-ons listed in comment #8 tomorrow and see if I can (so I'll leave the needinfo for me). If not, I'll probably close as WFM, to be reopened if someone has specific STR. :-(
Sometimes really complicated problems turn out to be really simple. Patch in a second.

in Australis' CustomizableUI, don't call beginBatchUpdate before potentially bailing and throwing, leading to the batch update stack being forever non-0,

So the issue is, the web dev toolbar isn't uptodate yet and we will probably change some of our toolbar registration stuff to try and help it work, but in the meantime, its added toolbar has our binding, which calls registerToolbarNode, which throws. That in itself isn't such a terrible problem. The problem is that before it throws, we call beginBatchUpdate, and then we never call endBatchUpdate. Then whenever we call saveState, we actually no-op because our batch update stack is non-zero. Simple fix is just not calling beginBatchUpdate before throwing...

Confirming it as 'fixed'. ABP icon still on the toolbar.
