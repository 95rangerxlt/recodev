Relevant only to 2005+ Powerbooks with Apple's new two-finger touchpad scrolling
feature.

When opening a link in a new window, when the new Firefox window (usually) opens
on top of the current Firefox window and under the mouse pointer, keyboard input
focus moves to the new window as expected, but two-finger scrolling remains
focused on the lower window.

Moving the mouse pointer at least one pixel (one-finger touchpad operation) is
sufficient to reestablish pointer focus in the topmost window.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ON A 2005+ Powerbook: Browse to any page tall enough to cause a vertical
scrollbar that contains a link to another page also tall enough to cause a
vertical scrollbar.  For instance, size a sufficiently short window and go to
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/
2. Shift+click the link, causing it to open in a new window.  I use the
"Developer" tab on the upper right of the Firefox product page.
3. Use the two-finger touchpad scroll feature to scroll down the page.

Actual Results:  
The topmost window ("Developer page") does not scroll.  Raising the previous
window ("Firefox product") reveals that it has scrolled.

Expected Results:  
The topmost window should have scrolled; the previous window should not.

Note that the keyboard arrows work as scroll controls right away, indicating
that two-finger scrolling events are different than keyboard events.

This bug requires the genuine Apple two-finger touchpad scroll function to be
reproduced; it is not sufficient to use the hacked two-finger scroll driver for
pre-2005 Powerbooks.

Footnote: while attempting to report this, but Bugzilla repeatedly barfed and
reported an internal error "A legal OS/Version was not set."  $#@*!

(more griping about bugzilla: I had to manually change OS to "other" in order to
post this bug at all, and then change it back to "MacOS X")
i submitted this bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308898)
regarding tabs, and it seems the behavior is related.  i will leave it to others
to determine whether 308898 is a dupe of this bug or simply related.
Fix in bug 255415.
Fix checked in.
