Given localization concerns tieing it to cookies might be our only choice at this late point, and easy to explain to users: DOM Storage is just "super cookies". But I think it's ultimately a bad choice that will discourage use of the feature and should eventually get it's own checkbox setting. (Maybe that has to wait for FF3)

If sites ever actually store useful data in there (like local writely documents)  users might well want to clear their cookies and not blow away the DOM Storage.

But it absolutely must be clearable one way or another -- if people think they've cleaned up their tracks and they've got persistent backup cookies in DOM Storage (a likely first use for the feature, as with Flash local storage) they will be quite upset.
We cannot touch l10n, so cookies it is (for now)

Neil, do you have an ETA?

Clear DOM Storage when cookies are deleted

The only issue is that the Cookies option is disabled when there are no cookies.

- In nsLayoutStatics::Initialize():

   if (!txXSLTProcessor::init()) {
     return NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
   }
 
+  nsDOMStorageManager::Initialize();

This can return error codes, don't loose them, return early on error.

r=jst with that.

I assume writing null to the key in sqlite deletes the actual data off the disk and doesn't just mark it deleted in some way. Is that right?

I'm so far away from being the right reviewer here, but are there cases where we build DOMStorage without MOZ_STORAGE?

Neil ought to review this, he's the owner of this code.

You may have mistook the MOZ_STORAGE define to refer to DOMStorage (actually called Client-side persistent storage). The define instead refers to the sqllite component.

This patch appears to just remove the clearing ability for session-only storage when MOZ_STORAGE is not defined, and session-only storage doesn't even use the database.

Could you describe what the actual build error is?

I think this has caused new crashes @  nsSubstring::IsDependentOn
For example

the problem was that nsDOMStorageDB forward declares nsDOMStorage
I think this has also caused crashes @ PL_DHashTableEnumerate.
So #24 and #31 in the TB trunk crashes.

this is trivial and shouldn't need SR, please just get patches landed
Checked the last patch in, and both to 1.8
sr=me, although the request had been removed by time I got here from my mail.

(In reply to comment #22)
> I think this has caused new crashes

Please file regression bugs on the crashes and mark them "blocking" this bug (so they appear in this bug's "depends on" list), and preferably add a comment here saying "filed bugs x,y,z".  Might as well nominate them for blocking FF2 so they'll get looked at.

Could this be something simple like the clearing code not handling an already-empty DOMStorage? I can't imaging there's any real-world use of storage yet, certainly not enough to be registering top crashes.
Marking fixed, please spin off new bugs for crashes/regressions, as dveditz noted
Filed Bug 353227.
