So, it works on Windows?

I'm using Mac OSX 10.3.latest on a blue G3.

Eddie

Please only nominate for blocking once this bug is confirmed.
Confirming. This is a regression from 1.5. 

I noticed that in 1.5 I see two modal dialogs saying something about my password after the "member verification error" page has loaded. Judging from the stack, it looks like this could have something to do with the hang.

I hope this is of some use. This is my first time using the Sampler program.
This appears to be Mac-only. I'm pretty convinced that it has something to do with how the "sheets" for modal dialogs are shown.
Member verificiation error, no sheets, no hang using a bogus ID and password.  Same behavior 1.5.0.5 and 2b-nightly.  Is there some special ID and password I should try?

This stack shows three ShowModal calls piled up on top of each other.  Those of you who see the sheets, can you tell me what dialogs this site wants to display in a working build (1.5.0.5 or on a different OS?)

Sounds like Camino Bug 325306, only there, instead of hanging, the sheets do not go away and Quit does not work. Force Quit is needed to kill Camino.

Eddie

Can someone please supply an ID and password (OK if they're bogus) that exhibit this bug?  I'm unable to reproduce it in a current Bone Cho build with a clean profile.  This is going to be really hard to diagnose otherwise.

Eddie, do you have any extensions that might be throwing sheets?  Do you have any passwords saved for the site?  (BonEcho:Preferences:Security:Show Passwords…)
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060801 BonEcho/2.0b1

These are the steps I used to reproduce this using the build above (with a clean profile).

1. Go to http://usfed.org/.
2. Type "123456" for the member number and "test" for the password.
3. Hit enter.

After a few seconds I get taken to the "member verification error" page and am hung.
Clearing. Adam, can you verify that you get hung with Fx2b1? I'm using that atm due to the number of hangs I'm getting with nightly Bon Echo builds and can't reproduce this bug.
I get a pair of dialogs in 2b1 on Linux, but no dialogs in 2b-nightly on Windows or Mac.  I do get a pair of sheets in 1.5.0.5 on Mac ppc, but not on Mac x86.  I haven't been able to get the sheets (and thus the hang) in a configuration that should hang according to this bug (2b).  Constistency is great, isn't it?
I see the same hang with Firefox 2 beta 1. Maybe this is PPC-specific.
I was eventually able to reproduce some bogus behavior, thanks to Adam's insistence.
tested on Mac PPC 10.4.7, build id 2006080204.

member verification error. No hang.
The steps to reproduce should be made more clear: press the RETURN key, don't click ENTER with the mouse.

When I experience this, I see the "member Verification Error" page (way to go, capitalization, folks!), but there's no indication that anything is hung at that point.  Note that, as stated in comment 0, the status bar still says "Transferring data from www.usfed.org…".  The progress spinner will appear active but be stalled.  The cursor spinner will be spinning, and some functions will appear to work.  At this point, you will probably still be able to close the window with few ill effects, although the ill effects may just be delayed.  However, if you attempt to interact with the window at this point, you'll wind up wedged more solidly.  Press command-D (add bookmark), for example.

Before the app is entirely hung, you may be able to quit and experience an interesting show of sheets showing and hiding and windows moving around and drawing entirely in white.

It appears that we're getting into a state where a modal loop is waiting for the user to click on an "OK" button in a sheet that's never displayed.  I've worked on bugs like this one before.  The system becomes very annoyed when you try to attach more than one sheet to a single window at a time.
I haven't been able to reproduce in Meinfeld.  (Possibly due to the new threadmanager?)

Test THIS

Adam, would you mind banging on this and letting me know how it works?  Some other things to test are the multiple-sibling sheet testcase in bug 312586 (maybe modified to be more rigorous, like showing more sheets at closer intervals for "green") and parent-child sheet cases like "New Folder…" in the "Add Bookmark" sheet and all of the stuff that the Google Toolbar throws up after installing it for the first time.

I notice that even with this patch, we're missing the application icon in the sheet if it hasn't been loaded yet at the time the usfed.org sheets are thrown.  I think that this is because of all of the stacked loops that we're getting, and I think that there's no feasible way to do anything about it on the branch.
Created attachment 231866
Trunk version

I don't know if this is neccessary.  Something would have to try to throw multiple sheets simultaneously.  The usfed.org test case only throws a single sheet on the trunk (due to the threadmanager?)
I verified that I was seeing this hang in my debug build before applying the patch. After applying the patch I don't see the hang anymore, just three of those sheets telling me that my password isn't between 4 and 8 characters.

After closing the last sheet I see these assertion:
###!!! ASSERTION: attempted to dispatch gui event to null widget: 'aWidget', file /Users/aguthrie/moz/branch/mozilla/widget/src/mac/nsMacEventHandler.cpp, line 118
Break: at file /Users/aguthrie/moz/branch/mozilla/widget/src/mac/nsMacEventHandler.cpp, line 118
--WEBSHELL == 3
###!!! ASSERTION: Attempt to decrement focus controller's suppression when no suppression active!
: 'PR_FALSE', file /Users/aguthrie/moz/branch/mozilla/dom/src/base/nsFocusController.cpp, line 514


I don't know if these are bad or not, of even if they are an effect of Mark's patch. I'll leave that up to the pros to decide.
Mark, were you going to ask for review on the "Test THIS" patch?

1. Regression: "just three of those sheets"... just two of those sheets are shown with Ff 1.5
and (IIRC) Camino.

2. Is it a bug when "those sheets telling me that my password isn't between 4 and 8 characters" are shown even when my password is between 4 and 8 characters inclusive?

That happens, even though I have an account there and am able to log in (Ff 1.5).

Please see Camino Bug 325306:

> We're spawning alerts recursively on the stack.
...
However, one more funny about this:
that "Please enter a password between 4 and 8 characters long. [OK]"
error sheet drops down Even when the password Is 4-8 characters long.

Is this part of the problem due to my financial institution's server code
(JavaScript?),
or is this a Camino bug, too?
_____

Do I need to file a Bug Report on just these "4-8 characters" sheets
being shown in the first place?

Is this a case of one bug ("4-8 characters" sheets)
triggering other bugs in Ff and Camino?

Are we only fixing the follow-on bug (the hang) in Ff2 with the patch above
while the triggering bug ("4-8 characters" sheets),
and the follow-on bug in Camino ("Dialog box won't go away, and Camino won't Quit.")
stay broken?

Thanks,
Eddie

I'm not going to check this in on the trunk because the new thread manager fixes the underlying architectural problem, and I don't want to add complexity where it's not needed.

a=schrep for drivers.
Fixed on MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH before 1.8.1rc1.

Re comment 25:
1. There should really only be one sheet, but there's an underlying bug here with event queues that's causing more than one of the same sheet to be displayed.  There's a bug on it, but it was marked fixed when the new thread manager landed (on the trunk).  I can't find that bug easily now - it's in my list, but apparently doesn't have the word "queue" in the first 60 characters of the title.

2. That's a bug, but it's not our bug, it's a bug with the site.  It only does that when you press the return key instead of clicking on the "enter" image.


Hang during login to financial institution site

fixed1.8.1, hang, regression

Add a "!=" reftest that will fail is msub and msup break (like in bug 345564)
