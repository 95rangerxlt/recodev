STR:
1. go to http://www.mozilla.org/
2. cookie list (see WT_FPC cookie and possibly others)
3. cookie remove WT_FPC
4. cookie list

Expected: no WT_FPC cookie listed
Result: WT_FPC cookie lives on (at least in the list!)

This is half expected, because cookies are like that. Really we should be using the official cookie API.
There's lots of potential to be smarter if we're using the official API:

>> cookie list --on-domain google.com

(lists cookies from google.com whatever page you're currently on)

>> cookie edit WT_FPC some-value

(Alters the value of a cookie, maybe also set flags, e.g. HTTP_Only)
We could make use of a date type (see bug 773271) with the expires field.

First kick at using nsICookieManager2 for cookie operations

I know Joe's hacking on the version of my code I gave him, I wanted somewhere to put my patch in the meantime.
