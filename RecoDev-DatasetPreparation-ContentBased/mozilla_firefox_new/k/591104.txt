we can mirror a single image using css, rtl images are taking space without a reason, we can save 13KB.

Unfortunatly I discovered -moz-element crashes on about: pages, but there is a bug for that!

Instead of using a CSS background, couldn't you use the image as a :before content? Like this:

#errorPageContainer::before {
  content: url('chrome://browser/content/aboutRobots-icon.png');
  position: absolute;
}

body[dir=rtl] #errorPageContainer::before {
  -moz-transform: scaleX(-1);
}

Then you wouldn't need JavaScript.
it's possible, will check that, thanks.

Works flawlessy, even better since I can avoid the crash, and looks like you just offered to review this change :D
fixed dependency since does not depend anymore from moz-element
Dolske, is my review sufficient here or do you want to review it, too?

asking approval in the meanwhile, imo markus review is more than enough here, also considering the code I'm touching.

I suppose it's technically insufficient, so rs=me to make it good for sure. :)

I assume this was checked with Ehsan's "Force RTL Direction" extension to make sure it all looks the same as before?

I did not have the extension off-hand when I checked, but I had tested manually inverting the body direction.
