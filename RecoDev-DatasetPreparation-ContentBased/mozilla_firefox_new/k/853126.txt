Current implementation
popup.warning=%S prevented this site from opening a pop-up window. Would you like to show it?
popup.warningMultiple=%S prevented this site from opening %S pop-up windows. Would you like to show them?

This code should use the current plural form

Note that the same problem exists in Firefox for Android (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=739757#c30) and Firefox Metro (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=840888#c21), not sure if a single bug makes sense or we need a separate bug for each platform.

Looks like you forgot to include the question part at the end (our strings are different from desktop now).

Naming the string popup.message or popup.ask would also be more consistent with our other notification entity names, if you care to do that.

Ship it!

The little winged :gps on my shoulder points out that if it takes >2 function invocations & >2 lines for 1 assignment, to split things across intermediate variables for readability. 
That said, this matches the other two patches, so please ignore the winged :gps in favor of keeping the code consistent across 3 products.

Changed the name to popupWarning.message in the desktop and Metro patches.
