Add the default profile image to Aero theme

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: This CSS change was missing from Bug 1139677
[User impact if declined]: Aero users will see a blank space instead of a default profile image on the in-content Sync preference page
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
[Risks and why]: Low risk because its a one line CSS change impacting only settings page
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
this landed on mozilla-inbound as https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/e5597c0d025d and this is now blocking the merge from m-i to fx-team because of merge conflicts

but seems this also not even needed to merge to mozilla-central (see below, so only the uplift is needed)

03:18 < Gijs> Tomcat|sheriffduty: did you merge fx-team (including the massive theme refactor) to m-c already, then?
03:19 < Gijs> Tomcat|sheriffduty: and/or what's the question? :)
03:19 < Tomcat|sheriffduty> yeah
03:19 < Gijs> great
03:19 < Tomcat|sheriffduty> fx-team already merged :)
03:20 < Gijs> that should mean that that cset no longer needs merging at all
03:20 < Tomcat|sheriffduty> was more a head up that i need to backout a theme change 
03:20 < Gijs> Tomcat|sheriffduty: yeah, you can comment on the bug with this IRC convo
03:20 < Gijs> Dao's patch will mean that that bug got fixed for free.
03:20 < Tomcat|sheriffduty> ok will do :)
03:20 < Gijs> note that that's only on 39
03:20 < Gijs> eerrrrr
03:20 < Gijs> 40
03:20 < Gijs> the patch will still need to land on 39
Backout: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/d4d1dbc43060

Approving for uplift to 39. Looks like this should not land on m-c.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/79a7935d16aa
it looks like there's nothing left to do here...

Bug 1148565 - Add the default profile image to Aero theme r=markh 

Backed out changeset e5597c0d025d (bug 1148565) for causing merge conflicts with m-c and so blocking the merge from mozilla-inbound to mozilla-central
