Thank you for filing this!

Marco is away so I'll at least find a regression window if nobody else does.

IIRC this was done by Mano on purpose cause editing folder shortcuts titles was adding quite a bit of fragile code. But must be verified.

Hm, but now there doesn't seem to be any way to edit tags at all anymore... except going to the individual bookmarks and updating all of them. That doesn't sound right... Mano, can you clarify what's going on here?
yes we need to fix this.

The wrokaround is to select all, add the new tag to all, then remove the old tag.
and likely this happens because we consider these read-only (they are QUERY_CONTAINING_QUERIES internally). I think we should be able to fix this, and write a test too.
> The wrokaround is to select all, add the new tag to all, then remove the old tag.

Wow..  And that now takes a lot of time, from 2 seconds for 100 bookmarks to 30 seconds or so.

Is that a separate bug?
I didn't say it's a solution, I said it's a workaround to obtain the same. This bug must be fixed.
Oh sorry, I meant that your workaround was faster in older versions of firefox (I used to do it normally when I needed to merge when tagnames collided).  This new slowdown might have something to do with the fix that created the main bug, hence my question in comment 7.
Actually, the slowdown seems to be general, I'm beachballing all over the place.  It's a separate bug.
Marco, do you have time to look at this soon?
no, but I guess I should find it.

I still need to have a second look, but should do.

driveby: if this is async, what happens if you type, and then you type again before the edit is complete? Or can't that happen here?
the function is called on blur

For now it should be fine, I should probably use Components.utils instead of Cu but I will fix that before pushing.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 951651
[User impact if declined]: it's no more possible to edit a tag name in the Library
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: unit-test
[Risks and why]: nothing specific we can predict
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none
Tracked for 41+ as it's a bad regression.
Comment on attachment 8654213
patch v1

Given that the risk assessment on this patch uplift request is not very reassuring, I would like to stabilize this on Aurora for a few days and then uplift to Beta41 if all goes well. Aurora42+ for now.
Perry, could you please verify this fix works as expected in 09/05 Nightly or later? Thanks in advance.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/4fa21e75f4ee
Backed out because the test was failing like https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=1106730&repo=mozilla-aurora
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/2687ae28ea37
pff, the usual Array.prototype.includes problem in Aurora and Beta... it just needs to use .contains there (luckily this is the last merge with this issue). I will push the fixed patch tomorrow.
ehr, indexOf... this array/string thing is so boring.
Ritu : all my use cases work..

Thanks all!
Comment on attachment 8654213
patch v1

Given that the fix was verified, it seems safe to uplift to Beta41.
we need to reland to aurora a fixed patch first, not using .includes on arrays, the same should be landable on beta.
Marco, do you have an eta for this? The gtb of beta 8 is today and we would prefer take this patch in this beta instead of beta 9. Thanks
I was planning to do that now, but I'm not sure what today means, is there a time?
