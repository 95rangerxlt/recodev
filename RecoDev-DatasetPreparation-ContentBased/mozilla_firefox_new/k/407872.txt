STR:
1. Create a new profile, wait for the home page to load
2. Click Smart Bookmarks -> Most Visited
3. Try to delete the "Minefield Start Page" item using the context menu

Actual results: no effect, even if you close the menu and re-open it.

Expected results: item deleted from history (?). Match whatever deleting the item in the places organizer does.

The only relevant bug I could find was bug 407614, but in the case of the bookmark toolbar folder, the delete functionality is truly broken (not just the view update). Note that deleting "recently bookmarked" items does work (although the menu isn't updated until you re-open it).

i think that this has the same cause of Bug 407612

Most Visited items are history ones, since the organizer and menus are based on bookmark id, they have itemId = -1, so the menu will not be able to delete them.

the best fix would be to move out from bookmark id and distinguish items through place id, so itemId would become placeId and every item will have a valid id
also notice that the menu item is not disabled even if itemId = -1, should add a check to disable not applicable options in such a case

I'll have to say that I think this is rather critical for FF3... I mean we have a menu item listed here that doesn't work, and positioned quite prominently, too. Think of it like this:

User updated to FF3
User sees great new "Most Visited" feature
User notices that it contains that he doesn't want to show up, maybe because it's embarrassing, maybe because it's a dupe (like the one that all GMail users get: #inbox and ?account_id=foo)
User sees absolutely nothing happening
User thinks something is broken

There are a couple of ways to fix that would make sense:
1. Disable "Delete". Easiest, but not very elegant... I'd say as long as not even this is in place, this bug is blocking FF3.
2. Delete individual history item. At least gives the user a temporary way to control the list, although deleted entries will reappear after a certain time. Also, the user will manipulate the history without even realizing it.
3. Delete item and place on blacklist for history. Will fix the issue, but not transparent as long as there's no GUI to remove blacklist items and also, the user will manipulate the history without even realizing it.
4. Flag history item as NO_MOSTVISITED and filter Most Visited list accordingly. Not transparent as long as there's no GUI for manipulating this in the places organizer. Also, deleting all history entries would eliminate the flag so entries would come back after that.
5. Create local blacklist for Most Visited and add the url to it. Would still need a GUI, though.

As long as not even #1 is there, I'm putting this on blockingâ€‘firefox3=? , hope that's all right.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
