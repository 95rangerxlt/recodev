The code in the BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER branch has different semantics (in terms of window ordering) than when it's not defined, as social discovered in bug 874566.  It looks like bug 462222 is currently fixing this - once it is done we can just drop this workaround from the module.

Via bug we, the current state seems to be that BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER should now only be considered true on Linux, but Mac works fine.  So in the short term, it might make sense to change the #ifdef in RecentWindow.jsm to reflect this.

Was that supposed to be a bug #? :) If your findings are right, we should  re-summarize bug 462222 and adjust BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER accordingly in a bunch of places.

It was :)  Bug 874566.
re-summarizing this to be about the general problem, now that bug 450576 is WFM.

Hey Katie,

Those review flags should be used to request review - setting them to "?" and entering in your mentor's email address sends the review request. I've taken the liberty of doing that for you, and requesting review from your mentor.

Thanks for the patch!

Backed out (https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/d3c5304d8011) because this seems to have caused browser_586068-browser_state_interrupted.js to fail on Linux, probably due to a trailing space in the ifdef:

Confirming that this fixes the timeout.
Relanded with the trailing spaces removed:

This may have caused regression bug 924456, see bug 924456 comment 38.
More "exposed" rather than caused, FWIW.
