browser/components/preferences/sanitize.xul (a dialog involved with the privacy prefpane) and browser/base/content/sanitize.xul (the clear recent history dialog) take their widths from the same dialog.width entity (in browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/sanitize.dtd), but with bug 480169 landed the two dialogs are now quite different.  A good width for one can be a bad width for the other; see bug 490655 comment 19 and bug 493485.  Localizers should be able to specify independent widths for the two.

Can we fix all the entity names here instead of perpetuating the lousy naming? There's no way to know that "dialog.width2" is going to be the one dialog and "window.width" the other (and in particular, which one is which). At least the inContent version is unambiguous, but we should just fix the other ones.

Nit: the value of the entity should line up with the previous lines.

This ID is still the old one.

We need to back this out or either fix it quickly.

The Settingsâ€¦ button doesn't work anymore in the Privacy panel, if you switch incontent prefs to false you'll see the yellow screen of death (broken XML, unknown entity &column.width2;)

I should have cleared in my comment that I didn't test or check the first patch.

I did a search on the 4 strings removed in it, and there's still one reference right below the one just fixed

This is confusing; this is the one "just fixed" in

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/7f9d625a5734

Yes, I'm dumber on Saturday. I assumed you fixed only the one I reported (column.width2) and didn't check the follow-up.
