This has been notified to me on the Mozillaitalia forums, looks like localized bookmarks backups are never removed, and never replaced by new backups.

Looking at my Library i just noticed i have the same issue, i have 4 old january backups, and only one August backup, that is replaced every day.

this is bad, and should be fixed in one of the next 1.9.1 releases, otherwise international users will have high possibility to incur in dataloss.

and when i choose Save, it tries to save a backup with localized name... sigh
looks like we do something stupid:
backupFileNames.sort();

In italian Bookmarks is translated with "Segnalibri", this means the new bookmark, once sorted, will always be the first (it starts with B), and thus considered the oldest.
we should provide a custom comparator for the date part, and possibly a valid unit test.

asking in litmus too, checking which backups are available is quite trivial and errors are evident. Human support would be useful.

please take the code and comments in utils.js noted below, and put it in a PlacesUtils.getBackupFilename(aDate) and have callers in both files use the new method to generate the filename.

patch v1.2

please, either blocking or approval if possible.

This causes our intl users to only have 1 bookmarks backup for the current day, practically no protection against dataloss.

patch v1.2

Approved for 1.9.1.3. a=ss for release-drivers
Does this only happen in Firefox 3.5 and later, or does it happen on the 1.9.0 branch (Firefox 3.0) as well?
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/66c98b03857a

I don't have CVS access to 3.0 branch, Dietrich or Shawn can take care of that, since i suppose we need the fix on 3.0 due to bug 445704 being pushed there.
patch doesn't apply on 3.0. please generate a new patch, and i can check it in once it gets a+.
comment 8 changeset is wrong, the correct one is:
