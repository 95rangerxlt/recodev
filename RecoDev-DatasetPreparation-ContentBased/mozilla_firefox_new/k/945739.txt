Are there any errors in the error console? Can you reproduce this on a clean profile and/or in safe mode?

Yep here are the errors, this is in safe mode.

Is this the only error? Because this basically means the toolbox's palette didn't get initialized correctly. I can't reproduce this locally, though. :-(
I can reproduce this when entering customization mode in a new private window. Here you have some screenshots:

Yep, your right. I can't believe I forgot to mention that.
So I saw this once, tried to debug it, then promptly couldn't reproduce anymore. Can't reproduce on a clean profile, either. Really unsure what would cause this... :-\

That's true, on the latest builds the problem seems to be gone, at least for now.....
Yep, I just updated and the customize menu is working again. Strange. Is there a fix or commit log I can check to see if someone found and fixed it? Thanks.

There is the plain hg log on https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/, but um, people commit a lot of stuff.

If you could reliably reproduce this earlier and you want to get to the bottom of this, it might be quicker to just figure out when exactly this started working again first by downloading nightlies to determine a regression range (see https://quality.mozilla.org/docs/qmo-community/lesson-plans/how-to-bisect-find-the-culprit/ or http://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/ if you're comfortable with a commandline and/or python). Then you can use the one-day range to look at the pushlog.

Hang on. I was writing docs and suddenly had a small epiphany. You're not on Windows 8, are you? I wonder if this was the switch-to-metro button (which isn't available in private browsing mode), and was causing problems. This was recently disabled on all the non-win8 platforms (as it should have been from the beginning) and that'd explain why we all suddenly can't reproduce anymore.

You're right! I'm running Windows 7 and the switch-to-metro button is no longer there since some time ago, so that's surely the cause of the problem. Nice catch!

Well, only inasmuch as then this would still break on win8. But Blair just tried this on his metro machine and it doesn't, so that's not a great explanation... :-\
Until this point, the problem was still there:
- http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4bf430d990e5
And in this one the issue seems to be solved:
- http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/85694fd9b17c

Gijs, can you see something relevant between those revisions?

Thanks for bisecting this! There are actually quite a number of Australis-related changes inbetween those revisions. I'll look at this in detail tomorrow. The win8 metro button thing is also in there...

Australis' non-private-browsing-widget breaks customize mode,

Test + fix :-)
So basically, I just don't think we should be passing these non-available widgets in if they are not, in fact, available in that window. Seemed like much the simplest solution.

Generally, I would otherwise assume widget build functions to not return null, and for XUL widgets, if they are in the palette then forWindow(...).node should be able to find them just fine.

showInPrivateBrowsing widget breaks palette construction in private window because forWindow(...).node is null
