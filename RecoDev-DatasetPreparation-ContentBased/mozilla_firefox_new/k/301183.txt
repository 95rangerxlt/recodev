I did some work on the warning icons to make them more in line with the latest
Winstripe highlighting and shadows. I'm posting this bug because I need
permission to land.

These icons are
chrome://global/skin/icons/Error.png
chrome://global/skin/icons/Question.png
chrome://global/skin/icons/Warning.png

you can see the new icons here:

Microsoft recommends against using the question mark icon for message boxes.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch09f.asp

Re-opening for consideration of changing this back to an exclamation mark, to
keep in line with Windows standards.
From that page:

"The system also includes a question mark message symbol, as shown in Figure
9.19. This message symbol was used in earlier versions of Windows for cautionary
messages that were phrased as a question.

Inappropriate message symbol

Figure 9.19 Inappropriate message symbol

However, the question mark message icon is no longer recommended, because it
does not clearly represent a specific type of message and because the phrasing
of a message as a question could apply to any message type. In addition, users
can confuse the message symbol question mark with Help information. Therefore,
do not use this question mark message symbol in your message boxes. The system
continues to support its inclusion only for backward compatibility."


I agree that keeping in line with the windows icons is probably a good idea.
Also in the Microsoft examples the tail of the bubble points to the right (where
the text and command buttons are), whereas the tail of the current Question.png
bubble is pointed to the left (where the outer frame of the error dialog is).

Very minute, just though while its reopened.

Re-opening fixed bugs for reasons other than "incomplete fix" and "patch needs to be backed out" is not a good idea, a new bug always works better. In any case, we no longer use these icons anyways, so re-resolving.
