Testcase: https://bug1064775.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8487618

"Box Model" says 404x31, hover says 404x32.
The box model sidebar gets the content width/height from: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/styles.js#569
The infobar gets it from: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.js#1162

So one rounds the values, the other ceils them.
Because pixels can be fractional we should always use Math.Ceil() e.g. 0.3px will be rendered as 1px.

Thanks for the patch, Kai! One request - for the future, we typically ask that the commit message be summarizing what the patch is doing rather than restating the problem it's fixing. Thanks!
