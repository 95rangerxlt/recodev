At current implementation of PopupNotifications.jsm, internal popup notifications objects are stored to |browser.popupNotifications|.
This is not low coupled design.

So I think it is good that we make this design low-coupled with using WeakMap.

Is setting the value to an empty array a performance optimization?  Otherwise you could just give [] as the default value to get:
return popupNotificationsMap.get(browser, []);

Oops! I forgot the 2nd parameter of WeakMap.get().
This is not for performance optimization.

Ok, just checking.  r+ with a change to return the .get() result directly as I have above (avoiding creating a temporary object).
This causes mochitest-other failures on all platforms (thankfully caught on Try instead of the entire tree). (Yes, there's other stuff in that push. I confirmed with another push that they're green on their own).

I now see why you took this initial approach.  This patch was correct and my review comment is what led to the breakage.
