Theme Previewing during Firefox Tour
I think it could be helpful if the tour itself automatically cycled through the list to demonstrate what they look like (eh, apply them and highlight which one is active). Or in general somehow make it more obvious to the user that they can hover/select the thumbnails to make something happen. Otherwise I'd be afraid that a lot of people wouldn't realize what they can do here.
One quick cycle through is a cool idea, with the highlight moving between the themes.

Theme Previewing during Firefox Tour (Updated)
Looks great!
What's the thinking behind opening all themes in a background tab (instead of a new focused tab) when the user clicks on the »view more« link?

I didn't want to take users out of the tour as this shows up on step 2...so by opening the "View more themes"in a background tab, the user can check them out at their leisure after they've learned about all we have to offer.

But wouldn't I assume that clicking on a link takes me somewhere? I already expressed my intention to go somewhere else by clicking. I don't think we (or websites) use this kind of behavior anywhere else.

If you're concerned about tour drop-off, would it make more sense to move this panel to a later step in the tour?
It's the step about customization though.

What if it just opens a new tab and makes it the active one. Then when you are done, the tour will always be there for you to come back to.

Sounds good!
