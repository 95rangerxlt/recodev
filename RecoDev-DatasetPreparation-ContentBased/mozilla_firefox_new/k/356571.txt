The fix for bug 245588 made sure that we kept trying if one URL in the list was invalid. This was changed in bug 308396, because the individual tab loading was moved to loadTabs, which gives up once it finds an invalid URL (one for which loadURI throws). Luckily, the call to loadTabs was kept in the try/catch, so the "break startup" part of bug 245588 hasn't regressed.

I'll take this so I don't forget it, but please feel free to take this from me if you're interested in fixing it :)

Add try catch clauses in loadTabs

moving patch here from Bug 390592

this adds try catch into loadTabs, to it continues if an exception is thrown

Gavin, can this be useful?
I see a similar problem happen with bookmarks.
 
If the first bookmark points to a non-existing page on your disk and you right-click on this folder and choose "Open All in Tabs" it will show the Confirm Open dialog "You are about to open 26 tabs.." etc.
 
But when you confirm, it will only load one page, the "File not found" page.

Add try catch clauses in loadTabs

You shouldn't need the try/catch around the addTab calls given the landed patch for bug 366705.
Marco, do you want to take this?
i'm not sure on what still has to be done here. i'll do some testing and see if i can do something useful. will take from you if i have some good result (and time) in the next days
This will not block the final release of Firefox 3. Any patch will need unit tests in order to be approved.
I think we just need attachment 275320, but without the try/catch around addTab, and a browser-chrome test that will call loadOneOrMoreURIs directly.

Clever! I'm a bit worried that this might cause some test failures (e.g. due to not implementing all of promptservice, or whatever), though... will have to keep an eye on it I guess.

Could have just used |hg mv| for a smaller diff here, fwiw.

indeed in a previous version i was using removeAllTabsBut, it was firing the "close tabs" dialog through nsPromptService and failing, that's the reason i looked how to restore the original factory, indeed after the restore it was working again correctly... Ideally unless we use any method that will use that service in this test while it's overridden should not cause issues.

well yeah, still i've also changed the contents so the gain would have been really minimal.
