The first instance I've seen was in this merge from fx-team to m-c: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-inbound&fromchange=f0865d36454c&group_state=expanded&filter-searchStr=OS%20X%2010.10%20debug%20Mochitest%20Mochitest%20Browser%20Chrome%20M%28bc3%29&tochange=2722b65059df

As a guess, bug 1192458 or bug 1208295?
Sorry, that link should've been https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-central&revision=3edc8d4a1e19
Does that mean we aren't waiting for the window to close? In https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/alerts/browser_notification_open_settings.js, should the last line be `yield BrowserTestUtils.removeTab(tab)`? Looks like it returns a promise.

I can look more tonight, unless :MattN beats me to it.
