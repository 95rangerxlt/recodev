In browser.js (delayedStartup) we initialize SessionStore & init a window only if windowtype is navigator:browser. We don't need to do that. Perhaps this is just left over from a time we did? Or maybe a Seamonkey compatibility thing.

I don't know if this is a Seamonkey compatibility thing, so before we land the patch, we should be sure. Otherwise we'd perhaps break Seamonkey.

I'd prefer this:

Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"]
  .getService(Ci.nsISessionStore)
  .init(window);
