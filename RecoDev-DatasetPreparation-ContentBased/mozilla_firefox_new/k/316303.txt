add and remove tags

Adds an em tag (and its closing brother), and removes an unnecessary </br>.
Isn’t there some sort of general bug concerning the beautification of the docs?  I’ve got the impression this is something that is going on for a while, but only when it fits, not consequently.

r=me.

And no, there's no general bug on "beautification". We file bugs when we need a place to attach a patch or we need a reminder for future work.
Seems to me like there could be a reminder bug for the <strong> and <em> insertion in the docs, where some guidelines are formulated?

Once again: no cvs write acces here, so please someone check this in.
