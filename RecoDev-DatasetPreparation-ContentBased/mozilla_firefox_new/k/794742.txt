When running the social tests, there are lots of entries in the test output like:

TEST-INFO | chrome://.../browser_frameworker.js | Console message: [JavaScript Error: "The character encoding of the plain text document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the file needs to be declared in the transfer protocol or file needs to use a byte order mark as an encoding signature." {file: "data:application/javascript,...

Low priority, but still worthwhile IMO, especially as such lines tend to be looooong

add a charset to data: urls

Trivial patch.  Note the same warning is generated for tests that use real URLs, but those lines are much shorter so I haven't bothered looking into how to reduce them.

JS can have Unicode characters in it, so we should use utf-8 charset.

r=me with the change in charset.
