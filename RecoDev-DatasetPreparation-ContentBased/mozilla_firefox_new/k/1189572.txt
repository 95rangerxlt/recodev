The Help button is clipped in a new profile (with no persisted page info dialog size). Nothing was clipped before the help button was added so marking as a regression.

This is probably as simple as increasing pageInfoWindow.height. [1]
Abhinav, is this something you would like to work on?

Can I work on this? I'm new on Bugzilla.
I'm able to reproduce it on my Win 10 machine.
Yes, you may work on it. We usually wait until a patch is attached to the bug before we assign the bug to new contributors.
I tried changing the value of pageInfoWindow.height in  /browser/ locales/ en-US/ chrome/ browser/ pageInfo.dtd . I also tried replacing height="&pageInfoWindow.height;" in /browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.xul with an actual value but that didn't help too. Can you suggest something else that I can try?
Did you make sure that you are using a new profile? The window height may have been cached from adjusting the window previous to testing your patch.
Yes. I tried it after removing the persist tag.
IIRC, removing the persist attribute doesn't remove the saved value. Please test with a new profile.

Changed PageInfoWindow.height to 550 to fit the contents. Turns out that the height was actually being cached. Creating a new profile did the trick.
