Not strictly menus, but I hope context menu is close enough. ;-)

In my work for SeaMonkey bug 487692, I ran into a problem that I inadvertently made a goSetMenuValue() fail, which caused a context menu item to end up without a label. I figured it's easy to test for this and it would be valuable to do so.
Also, it would be quite helpful for debugging failures of this test if the access key existence test (as well as this new label test) did say on which menuitem ID the failure occurred.

And, above all, I figured that Firefox should have those test improvements as well, and not just SeaMonkey. ;-)
