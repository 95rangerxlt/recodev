Steps to reproduce:
* With the 2 June Nightly, create a new tab.
* Start typing in awesome bar. Choose characters such that URL completion occurs and a selection list appears.
* Click on a selection from the drop down list.
* Verify the URL from the selected item appears in the awesome bar.
* Press Enter.

Expected: Visit the selected URL, as shown in the awesome bar.

Actual: The URL from the URL completion step reappears in the awesome bar and that page is visited.

I see this issue on Ubuntu, also seen on Windows (<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=12028013#p12028013>).

I just verified I get the same behavior with a new profile.

Workaround: Hit the space bar between selecting the URL and pressing Enter.

If You mean Bug 760836, Yes, it is intentional behavior.
We can back out the autocomplete controller changes only, right? That should fix this, so I think we should do that while we investigate further.
(and then retrigger nightlies)
Did that:
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/9274e6b53af4
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/6db7fbab6f0c
I tried to retrigger nightlies, but I'm not sure whether I succeeded.
Looks like the nightly builds are running now.
nope, not yet.
Aurora and Nightly builds are fixed now, completely resolved.
