This test was written for bug 648045, which needs to ensure that selected content docshells are marked inactive when the browser is minimized.

Understandably, it tries to use gBrowser.docShell, which is really gBrowser.mCurrentBrowser.docShell, which doesn't work in e10s. Predictable sadness ensues.

browser_tabs_isActive.js has the same issue:


function tabIsActive(tab) {
  let browser = tab.linkedBrowser;
  return browser.docShell.isActive;
}

which breaks because of the same reasons.
e10s test bugs should block tracking-e10s=+
I'll take a look at fixing this test case.
