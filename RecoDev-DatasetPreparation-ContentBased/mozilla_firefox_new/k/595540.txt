If you use Windows Vista/7 you see new Firefox button by default. In bug 593538 old Error Console was hidden by default for Firefox 4.0. When you use preference on about:config page and enable Error Console you will see Error console in main menu but not inside Firefox button. I think in this situation should be Error Console available in submenu Developer.

Should work but I didn't test it yet.

Nit: Just use ".hidden = false" as is done a few lines up.

Alas, the "C" accesskey is already used by the Character Encoding menu here.

But the simple fix is to just remove accesskey for what you're adding, since we're generally not using accesskeys in the appmenu anyway. [Character Encoding shoudn't really have one either, but it's #included from a file shared with the normal menubar.]

r+ with these two changes.

Make this:

#ifdef MENUBAR_CAN_AUTOHIDE
    document.getElementById("appmenu_javascriptConsole").hidden = false;
#endif

Also, please change the id from appmenu_javascriptConsole to appmenu_errorConsole.

updated to tip, addressing dao's comments

Carrying forward review and ui-review, asking for approval.

All of the app menu contents have been moved to browser-appmenu.inc in Bug 585370, so I moved this patch's addition to that file instead of browser.xul.
Thanks for updated patch! My notebook for Mozilla work is currently broken so I could not provide updated patch.

You changed the id here (indentation is off, btw):

>   if (consoleEnabled) {
>     document.getElementById("javascriptConsole").hidden = false;
>     document.getElementById("key_errorConsole").removeAttribute("disabled");
>+    #ifdef MENUBAR_CAN_AUTOHIDE
>+        document.getElementById("appmenu_errorConsole").hidden = false;
>+    #endif

but not here:

>+          <menuitem id="appmenu_javascriptConsole"

I knew I'd find some way of messing up in only 8 lines of code...

Oops.

Let's try this again?

Oh hey, reading is important. 

Sorry for all the bugspam.

Indentation is still off. The patch also won't work, because you indented the ifdef.
