I think SignInToWebsite.jsm isn't even used at all at the moment, but it's being shipped and loaded on startup. We should fix that.

v.1 patch

Right, the code shouldn't be hit unless toolkit.identity.enabled is true. I was going to put this behind the pref last year when Jared and I were looking through a similar list during a work week in Toronto last year but njn wanted to WONTFIX similar bugs saying it wasn't worth it (e.g. bug 888584 comment 2) . Now it seems we'll remove any compartment we can. I guess we were ahead of the curve.

I confirmed this works locally for both states of the ifdef.
