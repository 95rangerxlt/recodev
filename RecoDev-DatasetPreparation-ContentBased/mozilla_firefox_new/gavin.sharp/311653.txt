|this| is a textbox and |this.parentNode| is the entire search box.
tooltip value should cover both textbox and icon.

The other part is just removing the XXX comment.

Setting the tooltip to the textbox and to the icon separately, in order
not to triger bug 313673.


At this point, the best thing we can do for the dropdown menu is
to assign the same value as label's, I think. They look a bit
silly though.

That is,
> +       tooltiptext="rdf:http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#Name"
>         label="rdf:http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#Name"/>
and
> +       element.setAttribute("tooltiptext", label);

Note: separator in the dropdown also had the incorrect tooltip.

Patch (workaround)

We need to understand and fix the core toolkit problem here and not be using workarounds that might break other tooltips. Is there another bug on file for that?

If by "other tooltips" you mean tooltips outside of the search bar, there is no chance that this patch will break them. There is bug 81615 filed on the positioning of inherited tooltips in popups, but that bug only causes problems with the original patch in this bug, which itself has other problems (not all elements in the search bar should have the same tooltip). The latest patch fixes that issue and works around bug 81615 by putting specific tooltips on each of the elements of the search bar instead of relying on one inherited value for the entire search bar. It's a trunk fix, clearly not something worth respinning for.

Now I don't have to care about l10n thingy, right?

Sooner or later, we need a dtd file for this widget, so I stopped
crappy dynamic menuitem creation/delesion and set label/tooltip
in stable manner.

-              .getString("cmd_addEngine_accesskey"));
-          element.setAttribute("anonid", "addengine-menuitem");

Patch (safer workaround for 1.8 branch)

One of this bug trigers is that the icon button is a child element of
the textbox. So setting tooltip for html input element should be a
safer plan.

In this case, we have no tooltip for icon and dropdown.

Patch (safer workaround for 1.8 branch)

Given the previous regressions on this area and only a couple days away from freeze - we are going to hold on this for rc2.
we minused this bug  yesterday.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just encountered this bug today, there must be a way to fix it. Keep up your good work, thanks!

Hope this will get fixed in RC2.

I don't know anything, but just wondering will adding the tooltiptext up one level to cover both the icon and engine name work? Then the separator and "Add Engines..." shouldn't have any tooltiptext. By the way, the tooltiptext for the icon of the selected search engine should follow the tooltiptext of the search field.

Actually, I believe the best way to correct all these is to remove the tooltiptext once the mouse leaves the item that triggered it. (As in the Bookmarks Toolbar and the Tab bar?? They don't cause this problem anyway.)
RC2 still doesn't fix this problem. Interestingly, now if a search engine OTHER than Google is selected from the list, the text still says 'Search Google'. I'm not sure that was a problem in previous versions.
This bug's still here. It seems that the tool-tip for the search-engine inherits the last shown tool-tip. e.g.: hovering over "Reload current page" or "Go back one page" will show the same tool-tip when afterwards hovering over the search engine. 

It stays the same after selecting another engine. Interestingly, in the drop-down-menu the tool-tip for every single engine will show the "inherited" tip. Also when hovering over "Add engines".

1.5 has come and gone. I'm stunned that this bug has gone unnoticed. For the first major release since 1.0, a perfectionist attitude was necessary. Such an obvious bug being put out there in the open is not the first thing that switchers want to see.

Tooltip for the Search Bar shows the last tooltip shown from anywhere else in Firefox.
This could be a related bug or something different.  I didn't see another bug filed when I searched.  When I click the search engine drop down, every search engine in the drop-down list shows the tooltip of "search del.icio.us tag" (one of my search engines), not the tooltip of the search engine I'm hovering over.  This keeps happening even after I choose another search engine and do a search.

This is just the same bug. It is best described by Jeffrey Kaplan:

" ------- Comment #26 From Jeffrey Kaplan  2005-12-06 20:22 PST  [reply] -------

Firefox/1.5

Tooltip for the Search Bar shows the last tooltip shown from anywhere else in
Firefox."

After hovering your mouse-pointer over the "Reload"-button, the searchbar will show "Reload current page". Then you can go back to the "Homepage"-button and afterwards the searchbar will misteriously show your home-URL.
Checked in the initial patch on the branch to sync branch/trunk. These later patches are obsoleted by the patch in bug 317107.

An old bug has come back. Between the Feb. 23 and Feb. 24 nightlies, Bug 313673 has resurfaced, both on trunk and branch.

Steps to reproduce...
1. Click on the search engine icon.
2. Hover over an icon in the dropdown (ie. eBay).
3. Currently used engine's tooltip appears on far left side of screen (ie. "Search Google").

Since tooltips on the branch are basically broken (bug 147670 isn't fixed there, and it's patch isn't suitable for the branch), this just removes them all.

Mark, can you test this patch to make sure that the search bar is still exposed to screen readers correctly? Aaron mentioned this may be an issue. If it does cause problems, suggestions on how to fix it would be appreciated.

Why? They work fine there, with the exception of bug 336231, which can easily be fixed without removing tool tips entirely.

In the future, it will be removed from Minefield ?
Tooltips on the 1.8 branch are broken, so they were removed by attachment 223557. Tooltips on the trunk have been fixed in bug 147670. That bug's patch is not suitable for the branch. I don't see any reason to remove tooltips on the trunk.
