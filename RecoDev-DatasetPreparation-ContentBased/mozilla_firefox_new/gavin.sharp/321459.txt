Check for any extensions you may have that mask the user agent string. If the problem continues, seek assistance from the MozillaZine forums (http://forums.mozillazine.org) or contact the Mycroft administrators through their mailing list.
It dosnt help if your not using the same version. (You: Firefox/1.5)
Confirmed with latest trunk:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20051225 Firefox/1.6a1 - Build ID: 2005122505.

It works on the latest 1.8 nightly, though.
This is an installer only issue, right? Sounds like dom_sidebar.xpt needs to be added to the Windows packages-static.

Nope, using zip build here

Fixes the windows installer, removes old xpt from the linux installer. Not sure why the zip builds would be broken, but this is a start.
Could anyone test to see if this is an issues on linux builds?

patch

the zip packaging script uses the same packages manifest as the installer to ensure that the resulting installs are identical, which is why this breaks both.
