This was fixed by the second patch for bug 364297. It affected the zh-TW and ko builds.

Tony, can you verify with a more recent build (2.0.0.2 rc5)?

Per discussion with Gavin, I am reactivating this bug because this affects bug affects other locales that may have  a broken migration Wizard.  This was found origially for Portal20/PCHome 2.001 on zh-TW, but could very well affect any builds that have missing strings returned in the import dialog window (both 1.5x and 2.001)


Related bug is bug 371155
This also repros on the Divx 2.0 ko RC1 build.

Basil, timr: Is there any reason for this bug to be Mozilla Corp confidential?
This bug was fixed for 2.0.0.x by bug 371309, and I don't think we're going to be making any changes to the 1.5.0.x builds at this point, so marking this FIXED.

I think this is marked confidential as it affects how we broke specific partner distros and this had to be communicated to them very carefully.  Best to leave it confidential IMO.

It doesn't look like this is needed for 1.5.0.x.  Tony or Basil- do you disagree?  I vote for marking it fixed.


I'm okay with leaving it fixed for 2.0.0.x only also.

As mentioned on IRC, this bug wasn't specific to partner builds, it just happened to be discovered while we were testing them.
Verified fixes on zhTW and ko, 2004.  option now appears in migWiz
