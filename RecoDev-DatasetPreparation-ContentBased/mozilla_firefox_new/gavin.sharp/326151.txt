As per the recent arrangement with Yahoo, we should default to Yahoo search and home page for ja-JP, zh-TW, zh-CN and ja-JP builds of 1.0.8 and other 1.0.x sequels.

And by "ja-JP, zh-TW, zh-CN and ja-JP" I mean "ja-JP, ja-JPM, zh-TW, zh-CN, ko-KR"!
What are the actual URLs that should be used as the default home page? There are various values used for the 1.8.0 CJKT builds - none of which seem to be direct links to Yahoo.
The values from 1.8.0 are correct, and we manage where they point on the server side.
Therefore we can add the keyword fixed-aviary1.0.8, right?  Or are we still waiting for the server side fix?

No, there need to be modifications to the search plugins and config files themselves to do this "properly".
We need to be clear what is left to be done and who is going to do it.  I think there are two things left to do:

1) Modify to the search plugins and config files - who?
2) Upate the severside URLs - Sounds like - Gavin can do this but he still needs the actual URLs.  Who can provide these?

Anything else need to be done for this bug?

This is what I'm doing. I should have a patch for that shortly.

I don't think this needs to be done (and I wouldn't be able to do it, if so).

add auctions/shopping for ja-JP and ja-JPM, change order for CJKT

This effectively syncs search plugins between the 1.0.8 branch and 1.8.0 branch. Fixes this bug and bug 326150 comment 8. The only difference is that the Yahoo auctions and shopping engines will not be ordered (Yahoo will be #1, and Google #2, the rest will be unsorted). If these need to be ordered please let me know.

I take that back - I think the home page change needs to be done on the server side. All locales use the URLs at: http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviary101branch/source/other-licenses/branding/firefox/content/browserconfig.properties for new profiles. The CJKT URLs could be redirected to the appropriate page.

I'd like to avoid hard-coding the :official bit in the search plugins -- can we use whatever magic was there before?  Please?

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I thought we'd come to the conclusion that these values need to be hardcoded since the engine names are localized (i.e. there is no "Yahoo Auctions" in searchconfig, only "Yahoo"). We did the same thing in bug 326150, how is this different?

It's not, I just forgot that search plugins aren't preprocessed, sigh. sr=shaver, we'll have to figure out something else to keep that from appearing in the tarballs or something.  Not your problem.

For whoever lands this, the added files were just copied from the Mozilla1.8.0 branch.

a=timr for drivers
Checked in on Aviary branch.
Actually, the home page part of this bug isn't fixed. Maybe that should be handled in a new bug? Is there any opposition to that being a server side fix?
Sorry, false alarm. The homepages aren't localized, and already use a preprocessed per-locale URL. So the change is needed on the server side. I'll file a bug for that.
Filed bug 327208 on changing the redirect server-side.

change defaultEngineName too

Without this change, which I forgot in the original patch, this bug is not fixed. I suck.

I can't get a 1.0.x build to succeed, and I can't see any tinderboxes actually building these locales, so I'm not able to verify this.


Make Yahoo the default search engine in CJKT builds for 1.0.8+
