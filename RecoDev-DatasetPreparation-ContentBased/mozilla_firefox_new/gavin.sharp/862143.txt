We should probably relnote this: Sherlock-format search plugins in the application directory or profile will now no longer be loaded as of Firefox 24. This should affect very few users, but I think it's still worth noting.
addon-compat: this also prevents Sherlock search plugins (.src) from loading from add-on search plugin locations.
(though note bug 598697 means that this is only relevant to unpacked extensions to begin with)
developer note for people using search-plugins.We may have broke a lot of these due to this change
There is note there: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/24#Changes_for_add-on_and_Mozilla_developers
