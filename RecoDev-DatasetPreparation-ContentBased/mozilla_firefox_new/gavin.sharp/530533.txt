Fennec doesn't really expose the "current engine" concept - all of our search engines are always visible, and none of them is "selected" in any way. So the addEngine dialog's checkbox offering to "start using it right away" doesn't really make much sense. I'd like to make that preffable so that Fennec can hide it.

It pains me slightly to be going the pref route here, but I don't think there are any better options for something that we'd like landed on 1.9.2 before shipping Fennec 1.0.

I used the somewhat generic "hasNoCurrentEngine" in case this ends up applying to more than just the prompt.

I guess the ideal thing to do here would be to have search service consumers each implement this UI, but this is certainly good enough for now.
