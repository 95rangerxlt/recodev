The search service bases "officialness" on the presence of MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY, which means that builds with branding directories (e.g. the recent 1.9 alpha) are all considered "official", and thus use official search codes. It should use MOZILLA_OFFICIAL and BUILD_OFFICIAL instead.

mconnor says this blocks the 1.9 alpha release, patch in a sec.

This makes a build "official" if one of BUILD_OFFICIAL or MOZILLA_OFFICIAL is defined. I've tested this to make sure it works correctly. The easiest way to test is to run the build and perform a search with Google from the search bar. With an "official" build, the rls param in the resultant search result page should be "rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official", and it should be "rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial" with an unofficial build.

Feel free to land this if I'm not around.

looks good, do we need to fix safebrowsing as well?
Checked in on the trunk, asked rhelmer to update the alpha tag. I filed bug 362514 for safe browsing.

Search service shouldn't assume that builds with branding directories are "official" builds
