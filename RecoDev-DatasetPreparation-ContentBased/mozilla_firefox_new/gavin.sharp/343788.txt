That engine has no "text/html" result type, only RSS (application/rss+xml), so we refuse to load it. If our RSS viewing is in good shape, perhaps we should accept RSS-only types and just load the feed...
It'd be good to at least warn in that case, though, and not add the engine to the profile dir, only to have it fail to load at each subsequent startup.

make it a parse error, instead of silently refusing to load it

This makes it fail earlier, was has the result of causing it to warn that the load fails. This is a stopgap until we decide to support RSS results.
I filed bug 343824 for considering supporting RSS result types.

I wish we could give site authors specific info in the JS console in this case, but either way it's an improvement over what's there now.
I filed bug 343829 about better JS console errors for invalid plugins.

This is a low risk fix, it just makes the code fail earlier and show an error message, instead of failing silently.
