possibly due to bug 536336.

Playing with the DOMinspecor, I change the string for 'licensing information' to something very long. Then the whole thing displayed correctly. bug 536336 changed that whole string.

Unofficial branding only (since my Mac official branding builds, with the bit about the Firefox logos following the "Licensing information" link are fine), and Mac or Mac and Linux only (since my Windows unofficial branding build looks fine).

Mac only. The nightly I have running  on a Linux VM is fine.
Though I guess since it's only themed by global/skin/, it would have to be Toolkit: Themes if it's a theme bug.

I think the purpose of this align="end" was to make the Credits button align right. That button is an extra2 button, and extra2 buttons are put in front of a flexing spacer in the dialog-button-box. Aligning the dialog-button-box right (instead of stretching it to the full width) had the effect of collapsing that spacer.
With this patch the Credits button will be left aligned. Is that OK?

I think this is better, since it maintains the button position. It's an ugly hack, but I don't think we have any better ways to get a single right-aligned button on Mac dialogs. We probably should...

This looks like it should be a 300px min-width on #clientBox.

Yep, that works.

This looks quite correct to me. Why does the comment say "XXX"? Speaking of the comment, it might be helpful to mention OS X and/or align="end" as well.
How's this?

  /* Add a min-width equal to chrome://branding/content/about.png's
   * width, to maintain the dialog layout on OS X where the dialog is
   * align="end" to right-align the button.
   */
Sounds perfect.
