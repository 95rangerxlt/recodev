good catch.  Is this actually causing weirdness otherwise?
I think that the rakuten plugin for japanese would be sorted oddly, if Japanese wouldn't actually specify plugin ordering completely.
I bet most intl brandnames are ascii in the internet business as they want their brand to directly map to domain names, too.
Looking at http://people.mozilla.com/~axel/release/search-engines.html (future note, that link is not permanent), all our ShortNames apart from Rakuten at least start with ascii. Japanese Yahoo has several plugins differing only in japanese script, but again, japanese is fully ordered.
