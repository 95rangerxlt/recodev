Hi All-

In talking with Jeff and Holly today and finally fully understanding that the transition for existing users from Aurora to Developer Edition is really functioning as an update rather than a new download, we wanted to file a bug, hopefully for all the right people, asking to have both the firstrun and whatsnew experiences turned on for the Dev Edition, 35.0a2, for November 10.

Please add anyone who I may have missed and let us know if you have any questions.

Thx,
Jen

We'll need to work this into our whatsnew logic to ensure updating Aurora users don't get the privacy tour page. Jen, can you confirm this is a one-off and whatsnew will only be enabled for 35.0a2?
Also, I thought this browser used a separate profile as default, in which case do all users not get /firstrun regardless?
I brought this up in the check-in this morning. The consensus was that the majority of users will see /firstun, but there could be an edgecase. If it is easy to put this experience on /whatsnew as well to catch any edgecases we should consider doing so. 

I've cc'd ctalbert. He mentioned that he can help test this in the next few days to make sure users are seeing the right URL.
I've made the dev browser /firstrun page template also available at https://www-demo1.allizom.org/en-US/firefox/35.0a2/whatsnew/

Thanks, Alex!
Are there any requirements on how we offer updates to make /whatsnew work ? The version isn't changing AFAIK so we won't trigger the in-app code, and the default for updates is no whatsnew. aka what are the edgecases where whatsnew is relevant, and how common do we expect them to be ? 

I'm assuming we won't want to have whatsnew for every update (even for some small # of days), just the first one, which will take a little thinking on the RelEng side.
Hi Nick-

I think we were mainly just concerned about whether or not firstrun would catch everyone who updates from Aurora to Dev browser.

If you feel confident about that, maybe we don't need whatsnew?

Thx,
Jen
I don't have enough context to tell, tbh. We I ran the last nightly from the Gum branch just now it didn't open a firstrun page. It appears we're not setting the prefs we normally use to specify the url, see
 https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/gum/file/91ef7bf03b24/browser/branding/aurora/pref/firefox-branding.js#l8

/whatsnew normally goes in line 8, /firstrun in line 9. NB: This mechanism is all locales, not en-US only.
Because of bug 1024110, people who upgrade past the "switchover" point will get new profiles. So they should all see "firstrun", but we need to specify the URL in the prefs file Nick is linking to.

I don't think there's a way to do this with updates, given the new profile behavior, so this is a product change.

Something like this would do it. I'm using https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/35.0a2/firstrun/ as the link.

I'm not sure why we should restrict this to en-US - if the concern is that that's all we will have localized, I think it might still be better to show all locales en-US than to show all non-en-US locales nothing.

We should validate with testing that the upgrade scenario will hit this.

So can we say for definite that we do not need to show this page on mozilla.org via /whatsnew? (in addition to /firstrun). Not needing to do this will simplify things on our side a bit.

Thanks, Gavin. Agreed that it's better to show all locales en-US than to show all non-en-US locales nothing. Even though the page is en-US only, we want all users to see it.

What happens to non-en-US locales though?  Do they get the Dev Edition in en-US?  Or continue in Aurora in their locale?

There are localized Aurora builds, but I don't know the general state of them. Much of the devtools are not localized there, and I know some locales focus only on beta and not Aurora. I think it's fine for the firstrun page to be en-US only.

patch for aurora

This uses the following URL for all locales:
https://www.mozilla.org/%LOCALE%/firefox/%VERSION%/firstrun/

Joe, can you coordinate landing this when/where appropriate?
Alright - per the conversation in today's standup:

1.  This is the correct bug for discussing QA of the firstrun experience for the Aurora->Dev Edition transition.  Joe will coordinate.

2.  We will show the en-US firstrun page for all locales because all locales are getting Dev Edition, just with varying levels of localization.

Also, Alex: you can remove the tour from the whatsnew url.

Ok will do, thanks Jen

This was fixed for 35-on-Aurora. Note that if we want to continue to show the firstrun page for 36-on-Aurora (i.e. after the next merge), we'll need another patch (or will need to land this on mozilla-central).

Do you want a permanent firstrun page?

Hi Gavin, 
Yes. We'd like the firstrun page for Dev Browser to be permanent like it is for GA. Thanks for catching this.

+1. In particular, there is a pretty consistent and constant rate in beta for the event we're triggering on, we *should* see a constant-rate firehose of traffic into the download page:
