The netError favicon seems to be broken on Linux now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Goto any site with a favicon (i.e. Bugzilla)
2.  Goto http://www.adgasdgasdgasdgawg.com/  (non-existent site) in same tab
3.  Note the favicon is of step #1's site



My guess is this is related to the patch from bug 432938.

I can confirm that I get the wrong icon displayed with recently nightlies in Ubuntu Hardy.  It seems that the moz-icon://stock/gtk-dialog-warning?size=men icon is ignored when specified here.  (I do get the proper warning icon when displaying that image in other ways than as a favicon)
I can also confirm this on Ubuntu hardy. This is the regression window:

My opinion is that this wouldn't block final release, and is something we could fix in a security & stability release.
It does not affect all favicon pages. For instance:

1. go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_robin
2. at the bottom of the page (under "External Links") click the "eNature Profile" hyperlink
3. the wikipedia favicon does not stay despite the eNature site not defining their down favicon (as far as I can see)

fix

The moz-icon scheme needs to be exempted for error pages.  Don't think that this is blocking, but if there is going to be a respin for another bug, then perhaps this could be included.
Agreed it shouldn't block. So I'm going to minus the blocking but nom the patch for approval so we don't miss it if we happen to have to do an RC2
Does that mean that this is more than Linux-only?

fix

Sorry, Schrep - we should only be marking bugs for approval once the patches have been reviewed.
A moz-icon URI for the favicon is used only for GTK2, so this is Linux-only.

should update the code comment, too

Oops, forgot to update the comment.

To elaborate on the response given in comment 9, if the Windows or Mac error pages had tried to use a moz-icon favicon, they'd be affected too (this allowed me to test the patch even though I don't have a Linux box handy), so this is all-platforms in theory, but Linux-only in practice.
I fixed this by backing out the patch for bug 432938, per RC1 thread on dev.planning and #developers. We should roll the patch in this bug into subsequent patches for bug 432938.
Thanks for jumping in and patching this, Kai.
(even if we didn't end up taking the patch right away)


netError favicon broken on Linux; uses last page's favicon

polish, regression

Back out bug 432938 because it caused bug 433241, a=schrep/beltzner
