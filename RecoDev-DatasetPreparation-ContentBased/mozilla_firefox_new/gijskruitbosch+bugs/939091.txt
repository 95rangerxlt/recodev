Found by Mike de Boer when testing the drag placeholder patch:

STR:

(from default state)
1. Move edit-controls to the end of the panel
2. Add another small button to the panel *by dragging it onto the wide widget* (so not on top of any of the previous small widgets)

AR:
small widget goes before the wide widget

ER:
small widget should go after the wide widget, because otherwise there'll be a "hole"

(when fixing this, we should add a testcase)

Apart from two comments, this looks & works good. Not worth to r-

Good to abstract this an a separate method, but can you document what it does (docblock)?

I know this is copy-paste, but can you just do
```js
let itemToDrag = "sync-button";
let button = document.getElementById(itemToDrag);
placementsAfterMove.push("sync-button");
simulateItemDrag(button, editControls);
...
```
typo:

```js
let itemToDrag = "sync-button";
let button = document.getElementById(itemToDrag);
placementsAfterMove.push(itemToDrag);
simulateItemDrag(button, editControls);
```

PanelWideWidgetTracker should move wide widget up even when small widget is dragged on top of it if there are no more small widgets to fill up the row
