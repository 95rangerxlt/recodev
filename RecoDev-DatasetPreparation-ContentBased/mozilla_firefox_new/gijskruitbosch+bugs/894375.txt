The Developer Tools widget used to toggle the devtools toolbox, which is why the tooltip is "Toggle Developer Tools".

But now that we open devtools in a subview, I don't think that tooltip makes a whole lot of sense. Maybe something like "Developer Tools..." or "List Developer Tools" would be better.

Why not "Web Developer" like the old menu, or "Web Developer Tools" ?

Personal opinion: because not all of them are really web developer tools (eg. Browser Debugger / Browser Console).

If you want that changed, you should change it everywhere. It's still "Web Developer" in the menu bar and a bunch of l10n notes refer to that name as well: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=Web+Developer&case=on&find=locale

change web developer tools tooltip,

Alright, so let's stick with 'Web Developer Tools'. We should ideally fix this before landing on m-c because of the strings impact.

This change should have change the key name also. (like added a 2 after tooltip).

It shouldn't have, because nobody is localizing the UX branch, hence me trying to get this fixed before merging to m-c, when you would have been right.
You mean that you will change the key while merging it to m-c ? (How will you keep track of it ? )

No, I mean that this code, on the UX branch, doesn't exist as far as l10n is concerned, until it merges to m-c, whenever that is. So any changes here are OK, because as far as l10n is concerned, the strings will land in one blob whenever we end up merging Australis.
