Just a simplification to recommend. Also, when the button is disabled, it still shows a pressed state. We probably don't want that. I think we need to override https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/windows/global/button.css#64

I think we can just do btn.disabled = CustomizableUI.inDefaultState;

I don't think so, those blocks actually get overridden a bit lower down by !important stuff for [disabled]. However, it turns out we mess with this ourselves in panelUIOverlay.css . FWIW, those selectors seem to only match this button right now, as far as grep and document.querySelectorAll can tell. Any reason not to use an ID instead?

Great patch - A++ would review again.

Just one nit - but otherwise, works really well. Thanks Gijs!
