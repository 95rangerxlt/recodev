It looks like it was introduced by revision e6027b217801 (no bug). I can't find the related source code in m-c, so marking this as blocking Australis.

Actually, it's from http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/diff/c197150217d6/browser/themes/windows/downloads/downloads-aero.css (I just moved it as part of the merge, because downloads-aero.css had been split into downloads-aero.css and indicator-aero.css on m-c). That's bug 755593. :-)

I'll write up the trivial fix here tomorrow.

fix CSS error in indicator-aero.css,

This should do it.
What was wrong with the CSS before? Maybe I'm missing something, but all I see in the patch is that :-moz-any() is being expanded out.

That is exactly what is necessary. :-moz-any can't contain "complex" selectors, like the descendant selectors that are currently there. [0]

However, I just tested this, and the offset that's already there is wrong. Fixed now.
