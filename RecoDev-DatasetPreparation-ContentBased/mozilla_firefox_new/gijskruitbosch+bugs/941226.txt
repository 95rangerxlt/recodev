Elad, can you check to see if the button has disabled="false" set on it?
Oddly enough, I can't reproduce this bug again. I'll close it for now.

I suspect I have STR:

1. Close Nightly.
2. Open Nightly. Don't open the menu.
3. Go to gmail.
4. Once gmail has fully loaded, open the menu.

Does that make this problem reappear?

Huh, then I don't know. Thanks for checking, and please do reopen if you find STR / see this again. :-)
I can reproduce this reliably.  It happens after first adding the Subscribe button to the toolbar or overflow menu, but stops after Firefox is restarted.  Steps to reproduce:

1) Make sure the Subscribe button is not in the toolbar or overflow panel.
2) Enter customization mode, and add the Subscribe button to the toolbar or panel.
3) Navigate to a page with a feed link.

Expected results: Subscribe button is enabled.
Actual results: Subscribe button appears disabled, though clicking on it works anyway.
Yay for STR! I'll investigate on Monday. Setting needinfo so I don't forget.

document.getElementById("feed-button").getAttribute("disabled") in the browser console prints "true".

Alright, I'm trying this on Win7, because I don't have a copy of Win8.1 and don't understand how that could influence the bug, but I'm not having any luck reproducing. Here's my exact steps (on a clean profile):

1. Start Firefox. The button is in the palette (not the menupanel, not the toolbar - the customization palette).
2. Open http://edition.cnn.com/ in a new tab. This has a feed.
3. Open Customize Mode in a new tab.
4. Drag the feed button to the navbar, right after the search field.
5. Click the open CNN tab.

For me, when I execute step 5 the feed button becomes enabled.

What am I missing?

The bug occurs for me if I drag the button to the menupanel instead of the navbar, in step 4.  (However, the bug continues if I then re-enter customization mode and drag it from the menupanel to the navbar.  This must be why I thought I'd tested both menu and navbar previously.)

Curiously, button.getAttribute("disabled") === "true", but button.disabled === false, and button.style.MozBinding == "".

It looks like this button lost its XBL binding, or was never bound in the first place.  updateFeeds is called at the correct time, but when it sets .disabled it just adds an expando property instead of using the XUL property setter.

feed button disabled when in Australis menu panel,

This is another one of those issues caused by XBL binding madness. Setting the (expando, at that point) when the binding isn't attached breaks it. We had similar problems with e.g. the help button in bug 910851. Just using the attribute will fix it.

Should be:
