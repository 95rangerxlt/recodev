Spun off from bug 885075 comment 2:

Because [the drop target] doesn't occur in placements, when we drop something on top of it, we get a null placement, which means we use aTargetArea.childElementCount instead.

This last part is wrong already, I think; we should be using the maximum placement index (which could be higher - and is, in the case of the navbar - or lower). Jared, is that correct?

Without digging too deep, that sounds all correct.

pass null if we don't have a placement

Simpler than I thought; moveWidgetWithinArea and addWidgetToArea both deal with passing null as the position and will pick placements.length

Don't use aTargetArea.childElementCount to determine where to insert widgets if we can't find a better location
