Build ID: 20140218135856

Steps to reproduce:

I have an extension containing two XUL toolbarbuttons in a toolbaritem:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/cookie-whitelist-with-buttons/

In the Australis menu panel, the icons are aligned correctly, but the labels are placed too high. The attached screenshot shows customization mode so I could take a screenshot, but the live menu panel looks the same.

When the buttons are moved to the palette, the labels seem to be aligned correctly.

If there are two buttons inside a single toolbaritem, I expect that that'll need work from you in order to work correctly - what happens if you put the item after a row of 2 single items?
You mean like "button button blank extension button? It's still misaligned.

Yes, but the problem is that there's a blank at all. We're trying to avoid that happening in the first place.
Ok, I will try to install the buttons individually for Australis and report back.
Yes, without the toolbaritem wrapping the buttons, the labels line up as expected.

I can live with that, if buttons are expected to be movable individually in Australis. I'll change the extension accordingly.

Thanks!

Excellent! However, we on our side should probably still fix the buttons to not have that outlining problem (because some people might have a single toolbarbutton inside a toolbaritem, for instance). I'll try to look at this this weekend or the coming week.

add correct styling for non-wrapped toolbarbutton-1s for the Australis panel,

We don't auto-set the wrap attribute on nested toolbarbuttons, and so they don't get all the styling for free. At least this (the vertical sizing) we can fix. Not an issue on OS X because the labels have the right margin to begin with.
