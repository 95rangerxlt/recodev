Michael, do we have a hidpi version of this icon?
There's the badly named chrome://global/skin/icons/autocomplete-search.svg#search-icon, which newTab.css in fact already uses for this button when it doesn't have the "magnifier" class:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/0cf461e62ce5/browser/base/content/newtab/newTab.css#l336
There's already a hi-dpi version of this icon:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/0cf461e62ce5/browser/base/content/newtab/newTab.css#l357

Why is it not being picked up by the media query?

Because the #id of the selector is wrong -- icon instead of logo.
