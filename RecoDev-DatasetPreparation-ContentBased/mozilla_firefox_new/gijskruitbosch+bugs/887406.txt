Chenxia, can you still reproduce this on current trunk? It works for me but I'm on retina, don't know if you were seeing this on non-retina...
Seems better for me (also OSX Retina, though not quite perfect.)

Screenshot: nightly 25.0a1 screenshot

This is on the 25.0a1 (2013/7/08) build. Compared to the "customize" button, the >> arrows look a bit low, but perhaps that's the intent?

Definitely a style enhancement, not a blocker.
Also, this is not on a retina - this a 2011 15" macbook pro running Lion.
Chenxia, I think this has been fixed now. Can you let me know if this bug still exists?
I still see it, the >> being bottom-aligned, but since I don't see the ">>" button on any mocks, maybe that's just implicitly the design. Going to WONTFIX this bug, and someone can reopen it if it is actually a problem.
That's not an implicit design. It is supposed to happen if the buttons on the toolbar don't fit.

Chenxia, what build are you running? Are you sure it is up to date?
I just updated before commenting, to try to repro. The build is the 2013-08-22 build, 26.0a1. This is running on Lion 10.7.5, and what I'm seeing still matches the screenshots.

Shifting the image up 2px fixes it for me on retina, but that should probably happen on the sprite rather than using CSS (it is already in the sprite as an 18x18/36x36px image, like all the other icons). Something for Stephen?

Stephen, can you add this to your list of stuff to be fixed in the new sprites? Thanks! :-)

It is already vertically centered in the sprite sheet. Seems like something else is going on there.

center overflow chevron vertically,

Hrmpf. This is one way to do this.

Or we could do this. I like this better, but if any add-on is counting on this toolbarbutton class, we would be breaking them, so maybe the first is better? Then again, this patch saves us a bunch of ugly !important styling.

Seems weird, is there a margin-top on all buttons here or just the overflow-button? Does this bug not exist for hidpi?

There's a margin-top on toolbarbutton.chevron set by the bookmarks-related code in browser.css. This also affects hidpi.
Sorry, I meant to say that it looks like your patch is only for hidpi, what about non-hidpi?

I see now where the margin is being set. This patch only fixes HiDPI but the correct patch should fix non-HiDPI as well.

Err, so this is what it should have been. Still think we should just fix the bookmarks styling though (ie take the other patch).

This patch is fine by me, but maybe you'd like to talk to Marco about the other patch and get his opinion on which one to take.

there is something escaping me...

first: why does nav-bar-overflow-button have "chevron" class? While it sounds "correct" that class was actually just created for the Places toolbar (call that a "too much generic name" bug).
second: In this patch you are removing any toolbarbutton.chevron styling and replacing it with specific Places styling, wouldn't be simpler to just remove "chevron" class from nav-bar-overflow-button then?

I initially thought the idea was to use chevron class to decorate both buttons, but the patch doesn't seem to do that.

That said, I don't see reasons to not change from toolbarbutton.chevron to #PlacesChevron and kill the chevron class completely, if not for backwards compatibility... Though Australis is already breaking most stuff, so may be the right time to do that.

don't use chevron class, it only gets us trouble,

Marco makes a good point. I looked at the styles on Windows and OS X, and as far as I can tell, this is much the simpler way of dealing with this.
Comment on attachment 818370

I'm marking this obsolete here... I don't think we should necessarily not do it (IMO it makes the CSS a little cleaner to just use an ID selector rather than nodename+class) but I'm not too fussed about it.
