In order to help fetching various device contents like app icon, manifest,...
we would need a way to fetch these content from the remote to the client as they are accessible via URL that only works on the remote, like app://.../manifest.webapp.

Add a url resolver actor

I haven't added the actor to the browser actor list
in order to only load it when we will start using it.

That's so nice to do such feature without using any chrome/xpcom \o/
What about registering the actor in shell.js?
When I resolve:

"app://settings.gaiamobile.org/style/icons/60/Settings.png"

the mimetype is application/xml
How do we handle 404?
I still don't see this as a clean way to do things. It brings back memories of RPC.

In the current design, actors are entities with meaningful lifetimes and a related client that communicates with them through a collection of requests that operate on their state. For instance, the tab actor is responsible for intermediating with the remote tab and has methods that the tab client can use to manipulate the state of the tab, such as reload, navigateTo, etc.

This new actor is only capable of making stateless requests on behalf of various clients that could presumably grow a similar capability, if not return the data as part of other responses. For example, a hypothetical webapp actor could respond to an "icon" request, or even return the icon in the response of an "info" or "attach" request.

I talked to Panos. We need to move this at the app actor level. We should implement a `getIconAsDataURL()` method. Sorry :)
