I do not have step to reproduce. It seems to happen when using a debug build (which is really slow!).
You can see "target.ownerDocument is undefined" exception from getContent function,
and then the touch helper ends up in a broken state.

Prevent touch helper to end up in a broken state if events happens on dead wrappers or removed elements.
It also happens when you are opening an app and anywhere while the app is opening.
DOMWindowUtils.sendMouseEvent throws NS_ERROR_FAILURE when the app is in early stages of its loading.
