Console.jsm is used in many places outside DevTools, so it may make more sense to leave it back in toolkit.

If we want to do that, it's probably simplest to put it in /toolkit/modules (no reason for a DevTools folder with one file) and just install it to its previous path.

I agree!

Move Console.jsm to toolkit/modules/

This is quite messy as we just moved it,
but better move it now, in the same cycle (Fx44).
I moved the shims to toolkit/devtools/
And moved Console.jsm to toolkit/modules/

I could have kept the shims in /devtools/shared/shims/
and also kept/move Console.jsm back to toolkit/devtools/.

But hopefully, after some deprecation time, we could drop the shims and the toolkit/devtools/ folder completely.

What do you think about my various choices?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Moving the real file to toolkit/modules makes sense to me
* You also rewrote the path to match other toolkit modules, also makes sense (even though it's now a 3rd path for this module)
* I might have put the shim in toolkit/shims

Overall, seems good.

Maybe we could call this "shims" here?

It feels a little odd to revive toolkit/devtools for one compatibility file.

Move Console.jsm in toolkit/modules/ v2

Moved the shim from /toolkit/devtools/shims/ to /toolkit/modules/shims/
as it looks weird to introduce a new folder in /toolkit for just one js file
and it feels logic to put it in modules.

Mossop, Are you ok in moving devtool's Console.jsm to toolkit/modules/?
This module is used by a lot of code in /browser, but also in /services
and addons. This module doesn't have a strong dependency on devtools,
it is more dependent to dom/ console written in C++ than code from /devtools.

Move Console.jsm in toolkit/modules/ v2

Yes, moving Console.jsm to toolkit/modules is fine (I'd expect devtools to still be responsible for it in general though). I would rather leave the shim in devtools/shared/shims for now, no need to make a whole new directory just for that one file.

There are a bunch of places in tree that use the old path, are you going to update them here too?

Great!

Sounds fine.

Done. I did that in the expectation that devtools would become a system addon,
but we are far from there yet.

Yes, that the second patch attached to this bug ;)

Rebased.

Rewrite the URLs v2

This is just a sed #devtools/shared/Console.jsm#Console.jsm# over the whole codebase.
Are you fine being the only reviewer for this?

Try looks good, I spawn some retry on some orange. There is some failure on videopuppeteer test suite, but I imagine that's not related to this patch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I believe it's fine for me to review this, since DevTools implicitly reviewed the same change I made when moving the files originally.  Also, this change is quite mechanical, since they should all be updated.
