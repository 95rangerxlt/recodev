For some unknown reason Webapps actor `getAppActor` request never respond without dispatching any exception. The message manager code most likely fail silently because frame are not OOP.

This bug disallows connecting a toolbox to any non-oop app like system app, browser or keyboard.

*** Bug 913215 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Paul noted in my dupe (bug 913215) that he was able to get:

* Settings
* Built-in Keyboard

to work.

Settings seems to work intermittently for me, but I have never gotten Built-in Keyboard to debug.

Paul, you are still able to debug the keyboard?  I am currently running the 2013-09-09 Keon nightly unmodified, which seems to generally work, but maybe something extra is needed to get it working like you were able to.
Settings is a regular OOP app, so I'm excepting it to work just fine.
With my custom builds using master, I get a consistent behavior where settings do work and keyboard doesn't.
This bug is specific to non-oop apps.

Let's move this discussion back to bug 913215.

Non working apps:

- system app
- browser
- keyboard
I can tell, for sure, that this used to work.

Fix conflicts between two ContentTabActor classes r=paul

It ends up failing because of a conflict between ContentTabActor being defined here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/b2g/chrome/content/dbg-browser-actors.js#102

and the expected one defined here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/childtab.js#23

I think that would be simplier to choose two distinct names for now,
and may be later merge these two classes, once we start offering actors for browser tabs...
