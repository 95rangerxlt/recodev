Bump the browser to 1.5.0.2/platform to 1.8.0.2

Just like bug 321554.
fix was checked into the 1.8.0 branch on march 5
Do we need a separate bug for Thunderbird, or are you going to attach that to this bug as well?

I'll go ahead and do it; FFx and Tb are usually separate releases, so they'd be separate bugs, but I forgot that we're doing them together this round.

I also forgot to add the keyword when I fixed; sorry about that.
verified using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060306 Firefox/1.5.0.2. Will verify when we do Thunderbird.
Thunderbird's version bump was checked in by mscott on 2006-02-14, so you should be able to go ahead and vrfy.
