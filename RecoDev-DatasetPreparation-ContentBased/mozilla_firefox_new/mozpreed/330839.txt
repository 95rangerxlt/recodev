Need to make this switch to get the Bon Echo branding for alpha1
turning off the official branding is a blocker for any alpha or beta releases -- we need to do this in order to differentiate between final and development releases and to set expectations appropriately

rafael:  do we already have the graphic text for "Bon Echo" or will turning off --enable-official-branding result in "Deer Park" in the about box?  if not, could you please get with sgarrity and have the new graphic created and checked in ASAP?

Bon Echo graphic

Here's the Deer Park icon without text.  

Do we want a different Bon Echo icon?  
For Beta maybe or not at all?
We don't need this icon w/ text do we?
The graphic for the about page has already been checked in by bug 308973. All we need to do is flip the build switches so that the tinderbox builds aren't compiled with official branding (and thus will show "Bon Echo")
note that I've filed bug 331121 to track the mozilla.org requirements for this change
This was turned off and left off on the 1.8 branch.
