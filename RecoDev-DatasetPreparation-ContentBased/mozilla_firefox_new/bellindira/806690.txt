In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the perwindow/ directory, and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.

Thanks a lot!  I'll fix the nit below before landing, but note that the keep_current_session pref will go away in per-window PB mode.

Setting this pref is not needed any more.

This test times out on Mac on Birch:

I think this patch should fix this test: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/05865f2b8171
Yeah, that wasn't enough.  Backed out that patch for now: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d4a0fcdf66ee
This test failure turned out to be a bigger issue, and I filed bug 817463 for that.  The patch that I have there should fix this failure.
Fixed by bug 817463.
