Bug 867838 added a toolbox minimize button. It didn't get any UX review and not everyone was in agreement about the UI for it. So there are good chances that the UI changes in the future.
It's only in nightly for now, so this bug is about hiding it before the merge to aurora.
Also, it feels like bug 1173849 should be fixed before we re-enable this button.

Agreed, let's do that for now.  Always easier to wait to turn it on than to let it ship and deciding to turn it off later.
