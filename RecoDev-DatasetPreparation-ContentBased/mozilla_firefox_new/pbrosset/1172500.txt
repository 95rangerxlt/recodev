Bug 867838 brings the ability to minimize the bottom-docked toolbox host.
We should add a keyboard shortcut for this to be more useful.

Ctrl-Shift-M is the shortcut for Responsive Design[1] on Windows / Linux.

I'm afraid you'll have to roll your shortcut dice again.

Nit: You could use lazyRequireGetter:

loader.lazyRequireGetter(this, "Hosts", "devtools/framework/toolbox-hosts", true);

Same for more lines below.  I know you are just cleaning up for the linter so... up to you! :)

Is this really the only place we do this shortcut labelling?  Maybe it should be a shared utility function?

Damn ... What's the logic behind some of our shortcuts that use accel+shift on mac and accel+alt on PC? Why not always the same?

Cleaned this up, thanks for the tip, I had never really looked into how Loader.jsm worked, that was a good opportunity for doing this.

When I wrote the patch, yeah it was (or close), now a change to definition.js has landed that introduced a whole bunch of new shortcut labelling, so we could do better. I'll file a bug for this.

No idea why it's like that really... :/

This shortcut appears available on all OSes.  Can you post a try run so builds can be checked to be sure?

Nit: This is kind of unusual wrapping...  Maybe put this path in a const var and use it here instead?

Yes sure, I actually already ran 2 try builds, but didn't post them because some tests were failing on linux. I'm currently investigating and will post a fix and new try build very shortly.
I went nuts this morning trying to figure out a shortcut to use.
Turns out accel+shift+- didn't work on linux. I tested a whole lot of them only to find that a lot of them just don't work even if they're not taken already.
I settled for accel+shift+U which works everywhere and isn't taken.
It seems to work nicely: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=5c8f4e965055

Okay, if you've tested all 3 OSes, then it sounds good to me!
