This is mega picky, but since we're working out pattern for Task.jsm, you could also do:

    }).then(null, Cu.reportError).then(finishTest);

Which has the advantage that if one of the assert functions throws an exception, then the test fails rather than hanging.

Does Cu.reportError actually fail the test?

I wonder if we should have a convention of some boiler plate like:

    function test() {
      return Task.spawn(realTest).then(null, ok.bind(null, false)).then(finishTest);
    }
