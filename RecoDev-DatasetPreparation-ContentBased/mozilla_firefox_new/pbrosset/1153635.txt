Depending on how I select a text node in the Inspector, pressing Enter may or may not let me edit it.

Sad case:

1. Click text node          Line is highlighted
2. Press Enter              Nothing happens

Right, good catch, if you click on the "line" of the node in the inspector, but not on the text itself, the node becomes selected, but the focus doesn't move there.
Same with element nodes, just selecting the line doesn't focus the tagname, which means that if you press TAB, the focus will be moved to the first focusable node in the markup-view: <html>, which might make the view scroll up.

So, we should auto-focus the first focusable element in the line, when a node is selected in the markup-view.
For info, this already appears to work when you select nodes by the keyboard (moving with the arrow keys).

/r/7299 - Bug 1153635 - Focus first focusable element in MarkupContainer when line is clicked; r=bgrins

Pull down this commit:

hg pull -r 51006c062dd1e76c7a5f4157223634b57fef5657 https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/gecko/
For info: moving the focus programmatically from a mousedown event handler always fails because the mousedown event then bubbles up to the body which reclaims the focus.
stopPropagation isn't enough to stop this, preventDefault has to be used too (which is what I did).
Another way would have been to refocus the element on mouseup, but that would be a bit weird. The other thing I could have done was add a setImmediate around the this.markup.navigate(this) to make sure the focus is given after the body has taken it, but that looked more like a hack to me.

Clicking text node in inspector does not properly focus it
