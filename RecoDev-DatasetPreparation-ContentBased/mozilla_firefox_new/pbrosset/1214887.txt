I'm going to fix this by making the animation last for 100s or something. We should never really have tests that use short-running animations, it's just too prone to intermittents like this.

Bug_1214887_-_Use_a_long_animation_in_browser_anim.diff

We should never really use short animations in tests, so I changed the test so that we now use a very long animation. This should prevent any chance of the animation being finished by the time we check its playState is "running". At the end of the test, I then set its currentTime so that the test doesn't have to wait for 100s before checking that the playState goes to "finished".
