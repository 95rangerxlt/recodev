I just realized Chrome DevTools have this awesome sort-of-hidden feature where if you alt+click a node in the markup panel, not only the node with expand, but all of its descendants too.

It's super easy to do in the Firefox Devtools too, because we already have the function that does it: MarkupView.expandAll(node). By the way that function doesn't seem to be used anywhere.

Note: on windows/linux I believe it is CTRL + ALT + Click.

That's correct, although I don't understand why. It feels simpler to have alt+click on all platforms, and I don't think alt+click is already bound to any other action.

As we discussed, listening for alt+click will also catch alt+ctrl+click anyway.  So this should be good to go as-is.

Will, we've added a new shortcut on the markup view that allows expanding all child nodes by alt+clicking on the little arrow next to the node.
