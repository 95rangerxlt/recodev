It's dead code, I don't think it was ever enabled by default, it has no tests, and the value is kind of limited I believe.

LGTM, thanks.  Commit message should probably read 'markupview preview' so it doesn't look like we are removing the markup view

Yeah, good catch.
Try build: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=7a9d52f63996

Clearing NI? as I just talked to Jeff in person.
To be clear: kill it.

I personally found it useful since it gave a global preview of all DOM mutations happening on the page (you can see the yellow flash on different lines in the preview). While the markup view itself only displays mutations for the current viewed markup, which is not convenient if you have various mutations happening on different parts of the dom, but at the same time.
Also, the feature could have been much more useful if it had the click to scroll feature ST has, it's much faster to click there than actually searching a specific selector.
