[screenshot] black bars

Using the 11/10/2014 build of nightly/webIDE, whenever I try to use the web inspector with my flame, I see a black box overlaying the screen. As I hover the mouse over different DOM elements in the WebIDE devtools, the black box sometimes goes away, and sometimes displays css information in plain black text below the box. I couldn't get a screenshot of the text, since it goes away when I'm not hovering over the devtools. Note: I can still interact with the device normally, but the bars make it hard to see what is going on.

Patrick, can you take a look?  This sounds related to your highlighter work.
Michael, what build of Gaia and Gecko do you have on device?

This looks like the CSS for the highlighter hasn't been properly loaded . I'm currently updating my device to check this out.
Confirmed locally, the CSS is missing completely :(
I think the last time I tested on a B2G device was before I changed the way the css gets loaded.

The highlighter.css gets loaded thanks to the |installHelperSheet| function (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.js#1550) which is also the function we use for loading the CSS required for the simple outline highlighter (and I know this one works because that's the highlighter which has been used up until now on B2G).

The CSS that gets loaded is http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.js#439 so either that |@import| rule is failing or the actual CSS code itself isn't working on B2G (for info, this CSS relies on the new :-moz-native-anonymous pseudo-class added recently as seen here http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/devtools/highlighter.css?force=1#16).
After talking to jryans, I realized that the css file being in /browser/ means that it never gets to B2G (or any other app). That file should be in /toolkit/ instead to be shared.
This used to work when the css code was in ua.css, but I moved it to its own file before landing the new highlighter.

This patch moves highlighter.css to toolkit/content so that it is available in other apps too.
jryans: not sure who to ping for review for this.
I have tested this on my peak device by updating omni.ja on the device. I'll properly re-build b2g with this patch too, to make sure this works fine.
Inspector devtools tests passed fine locally. Here's also a try build: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=d355d42b770a

Seems generally okay to me, but flagging Mossop as a toolkit reviewer in case some other name or file placement would preferred.
Ok, just confirmed that the fix works fine after building B2G with the patch applied.

Paolo has agreed to take a look at this after we discuss about the highlighter. Flagging him for review instead.

bug1096575-missing-highlighter-css-on-b2g v2.patch

Hi Paolo, after our discussion on IRC, I tried moving the highlighter.css file to toolkit/devtools/server/actors and loading it using a resource: URI, but that didn't work because the loader using in toolkit/devtools/Loader.jsm is JS loader only. The CSS file didn't get referenced.

Here's a patch with a different approach: the file is in toolkit/devtools/ (we don't have other devtools css files in toolkit for now, so it seemed weird to create a directory just for this one file), and I've added a jar.mn file that references it.

Sorry, forgot to remove an unrelated change.

Did you try adding the file to the EXTRA_JS_MODULES in moz.build, like "menu.css"?

Indeed, this makes the patch simpler.
I tested this new patch on a B2G device, it works fine.

Review of attachment 8522285:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, since we discussed placing the CSS file as close as possible to the file that includes it, I suggest one change:

::: toolkit/devtools/moz.build
@@ +40,5 @@
>  
>  EXTRA_JS_MODULES.devtools += [
>      'Console.jsm',
>      'DevToolsUtils.jsm',
> +    'highlighter.css',

You can probably place the highlighter.css file closer to highlighter.js, by placing it in the server's moz.build file under this section:

EXTRA_JS_MODULES.devtools.server.actors

And adjust the URI accordingly.

Thanks Paolo for the quick review!
Here's a new patch with the file closer to highlighter.js now.
