I think bug 1179111 gives us the ability to know, so it'd be easy enough to indicate this in the UI somehow.

1 - Color code animations and transitions so they look different
Created attachment 8650977
color-coded-animations.PNG

Here's what animations look like with the patch applied.
Other options are:
- adding the words "Transition" and "Animation" in the timeline, but that takes a lot of space and we're already using ellipsis if the animation names are too long,
- using icons, but coming up with good icons will be hard,
- separating animations and transitions in 2 sections with section headers.

Note that in the future, there will be SVG SMIL animations in here too, as well as script-generated web animations.
Brian, any ideas on this? Do you think colors are enough at this stage?

Looks fine to me - you might combine that with tooltiptext that indicates "opacity - transition" and "anim open - animation"

Removing this flag, the platform work for this has already been done before.

Bug_1180134_-_1_-_Color_code_animations_and_transi.diff

This patch contains:
- a new 'type' property in each animation actor's state object
- some cleanup in the css and 2 new css classes for transitions and animations to look different
- the ui component responsible for displaying animations uses the actor's state to use the new css classes
- new l10n strings that are used as tooltips on animations in the ui
- some tests

Here there is a falsy check for state.type but above we string concat state.type + " iterations".  What's the case where it's falsy?  It appears it would end up adding "null" as a class name.

Worth adding a note of what the %S is going to be here

Nit: var(--theme-selection-color) is pretty much white and will match up with other colors seen in the toolbox

This type doesn't seem to be used at all, but null is returned instead.  This should either be removed from the const, or we should be returning TYPES.UNKNOWN and looking for that in the tool frontend.

Thanks, filed bug 1233363 to fix this.


Indicate if an animation displayed in the animation-inspector comes from a CSS transition or a CSS animation
