Ah, bummer. I didn't even think to switch themes when working on that. /o\

Make the headers request URL and security panel info visible in the dark theme
Partial try run ongoing in https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=150ff68993b9 (for another bug) but given that it's a one-line CSS colour change to fix a regression, I don't see a need for a full run.
If the one reading this due to checkin-needed disagrees, just let me know.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: degraded experience for web developers, several pieces of network debugging info are unreadable on dark theme, fix is very low risk
Sounds like a good plan to get this uplifted, please nominate once it's on central.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 1123952 and bug 1129055

[User impact if declined]: Developer Edition (and eventually release) will be frustrating to use for developers, since several pieces of network debugging information will be unreadable if they are using the dark theme (the default on DevEdition?).

[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: none

[Risks and why]: very low. One-line CSS colour change

[String/UUID change made/needed]: none
Please don't use leave-open to track uplifts, it screws up our bug queries. Bug resolution tracks landing on mozilla-central, tracking flags track uplifts.
