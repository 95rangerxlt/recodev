One of the side effects of my recent heartbeat removal is that tab thumbnails no longer automatically repaint when resized. We should have TabItem.setBounds call TabItems.update. 

Probably shouldn't make this fix until we have a few other details sorted out:

* TabItems.pausePainting needs to be fixed
* We shouldn't repaint thumbnails when the Tab Candy UI isn't visible
* If we need to repaint a bunch of thumbnails at the same time, spread them out.

Done (including the sub-items in the above list):
