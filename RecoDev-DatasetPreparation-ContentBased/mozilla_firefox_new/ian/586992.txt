i was turning some tabs into app tabs, and suddenly all non-app tabs disappeared.

note: i had not opened tabview at all since restarting the browser.

after the disappearance, i went to tabview, and all my tabs (app + disappeared) were in a stack (not group) in the bottom right-hand corner.

workaround: move all in the stack into a group, open the group. you're back to where you started. except you have to manually re-order the tabs back into position.

blocking for investigation. this especially shouldn't happen when someone hasn't opened tabview at all.
I suppose for now, you can skip the manual part with this to put them into one group I believe:

Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/Services.jsm"); e = Services.wm.getEnumerator("navigator:browser"); while (e.hasMoreElements()) { w = e.getNext().document.getElementById("tab-view").contentWindow; w.GroupItems.removeAll(); g = new w.GroupItem([], { bounds: { left: 0, top: 0, width: 400, height: 400 }, title: "all pages" }); w.TabItems.getItems().forEach(function(i) { if (i.parent) i.parent.remove(i); g.add(i, null, {animate: false}) }); }

It's basically getting some of the fix from bug 574875.
I believe this will be fixed when we fix 574875.

Still happens in today's nightly
This should be fixed by the patch in bug 586693, which landed on Trunk today.
Aza suggests that mitcho is unavailable, and Ian should own this. -> Ian

I don't think the issue has been fixed.
In today's nightly a new window opens with the http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/ tab as the only tab. Tab view still shows this tab in the bottom right-hand corner when according to the video on the same interface it should show in the upper left-hand corner. (And other videos such as the one in http://vimeo.com/13560319 shows the same thing)
Can you try an hourly build with this fix? What platform are you on? This only happens for *new windows*?

TabView first run

With nightly 20100816131239 fc2a78c0ac8d and clean profile just now the first TabView run puts the two welcome windows nice and big in the big tab group on the left.

I will try if you give me the hourly build link. I'm on Windows 7. It happens with *new windows* and fresh profiles.
