Test environment:
   Windows XP, Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060807, Inspect32 (Inspect Objects)
   Optional: screen reader (JAWS 7.1 or Window-Eyes 5.5N (latest beta))

Description: 
  This user is not hearing the browser message alert bar with Window-Eyes
 when he tries to install an extension from here:
 http://dragtotab.mozdev.org/popupsound/. This is a regression because it worked fine at older nightly build versions.

Steps to Recreate:
1. Start up WE 5.5N and FF2.
2. Bring up the URL: http://dragtotab.mozdev.org/popupsound/
3. Click on "Install it"
4. You will notice that a message bar will appear stating "Bon Echo prevented this site (dragtotab.mozdev.org) from asking you to install software on your computer. BUT Window Eyes does not speak any of the dialog.
 
Expected results:
The screen reader JAWS or WE 5.5N in this case should read the contents of messagebanner.

NOTE: This is a regression, seems to work with the old format using a pop dialog in Bon Echo nigthly build 20070706.

Yikes, this has to do with the notification widget. There's a notifcation and a notificationbox element. We're creating the accessible for the notification but firing the AlertActive for the notificationbox.

The generated accessible and event need to be for the same DOM element.

Another problem is that the notifcation box seems to surround the entire content. I need a node which has just the notification in it.
It turns out we're creating the correct accessible but we need to fire the AlertActive for that accessible's DOM node.

The right DOM node has the notifcation binding, not the notificationbox binding.

1) Fire AlertActive for notification not for notificationbox, 2) Wait to fire it until the notification is visible
