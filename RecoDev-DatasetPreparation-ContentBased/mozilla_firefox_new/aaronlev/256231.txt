I lost my mouse in an bad milk spilling incident, so I tried to see what
keyboard shortcuts where available: only to find I can't access the topics in
the LHS of the help dialog via the keyboard - importantly "keyboard shortcuts".

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Alt+H, Help Contents
2. Try to navigate menu without using mouse
3.

Actual Results:  
You can't gain focus

Expected Results:  
Gain foucs

Perhaps this should be a HTML canvas and the list should be a bunch of LI's so
You can use all of firefox's nifty inline find features. Shortcuts needed for
glossary, index, search, contents, contents items.

Help is now gotten to by typing F1 instead of Alt-H.  Using Tab after Help is
initiated gives it focus and WFM.
