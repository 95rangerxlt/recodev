Screen readers have features to navigate by "form"

This means we need to expose accessible objects for the form nodes.

Create generic accessible for "form"
Looks good to me, out of curiosity though which Screen readers have this
feature, and what on "form" is navigateable?

Plus when we have a situation like

<form></form> what happens with the Screen Reader in question?

Our DOM with Forms can be quite onerous in some cases, where we have form
controls (Input, etc.) sitting un-nested from the form element they work with,
as far as I understand the relevant code.
Window-Eyes has the feature, and they're adding capaibility to recognize this
MSAA role.

They know that the <form> elements may not always be placed correctly. The
prev/next form navigation goes to the beginning of each form -- the first
accessible element within that.
