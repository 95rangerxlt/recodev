When XUL tabs get focused (they do as of bug 175893) the focus outline is
currently appearing outside of the tab (because of fix for bug 151375). It
should appear inside.

Will need similar patch for seamonkey.

Same fix for Seamonkey

You need class="box-inherit" and various xbl:inherits in case someone wants to
e.g. swap the text and icon. See button.xml for example. Have you tried Venkman
with this patch? I think you might need to adjust the display of its little
tabs. You should also try to use a unique class rather than a generic tag for
your style rules. Can you explain why you might possibly need that min-width?
Finally r+sr is a layout convenience, it does not apply to xpfe, until jag et
al decide that it does.

needs to be patched to work with the added hbox.

Done.

The tabs look fine in Venkman, although they are not focusable.

Done

Otherwise the tabs ended up very wide. I looked around in other parts of
tabbrowser.xml and saw similar min-width lines. What's a better way?

Addresses some of Neil's comments. Questions on others.

Should't the tabbox rules that were added earlier be using .tab-middle instead
of hbox?  The classic/global/win/tabbox.css change should be added/updated as
well.

I'm assuming you meant the toolkit change to be added to the tab instead of
tabs-closebutton.

Removes min-width

min-width wasn't necessary after all, but flex="1" is necessary.

r=me, minus the tabbrowser.xml changes which look to be for bug 175893, if the
tab:focus rules lose the unnecessary > hbox.

sr=me if you ensure that someone has filed a bug to make linux tabs less ugly
in general.
