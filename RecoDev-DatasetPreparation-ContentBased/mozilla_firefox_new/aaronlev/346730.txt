Expose list bullets in accessible text

Eventually list bullets and :before/:after text will get a text attribute "static:true". That's bug 340670.

In addition, we need to deal with all of the GetText[At|Before|After]Offset implications when static text is part of a paragraph.
File bug 348907 on nsHyperTextAccessible issues that will need to be resolved after this patch (caret, text getters, etc.)
There are some crashes @ nsAccessible::TextLength.
Not sure what can be wrong.

Please file a separate bug and include a test case.
Well, I noticed the crashes when I was looking at http://talkback-public.mozilla.org/reports/firefox/FFTrunk/FFTrunk-topcrashers.html
So atm I have no idea what the testcase should look like. I just know that the method is causing some crashes.
