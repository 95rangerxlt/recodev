Point Firefox to a page containing the following:

<html>
<ol>
<li>Here is 1 item.
<li>Here is 2 item.
<li>Here is 3 item.
<li>Here is 4 item.
</ol>
</html>

When I try to call setCaretOffset on a list item pointing it to something around the manfactured list item number (e.g., the '.' in '1. Here is 1 item'), I believe I'm seeing the following behavior:

1) The return value of setCaretOffset is True

2) The caret position, as indicated by an object:caret-moved event, seems to position the caret at the end of the text


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details
Actual Results:  
See details

Expected Results:  
If the caret cannot be positioned to where I request, I'd expect the return value to setCaretOffset to be False, I'd not expect the caret to move, and I wouldn't expect to get a caret-moved event.

1) Don't change selection until range created, 2) Utilize error return values


setCaretOffset doesn't return False if it cannot set the caret offset
