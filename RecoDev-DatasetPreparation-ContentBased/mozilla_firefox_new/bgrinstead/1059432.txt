The command button for frame selection doesn't match the other ones.  Most importantly, it's background color is different (especially noticeable on the dark theme).

Two things you can see in the screenshot: matching bg color and a tiny bit more left-right padding in the new one.  There is one more thing you can't see in the screenshot that has to do with the icon not flickering color changes when hovering and opening the popup (you really have to compare opening the menu before and after the patch to see that change)
