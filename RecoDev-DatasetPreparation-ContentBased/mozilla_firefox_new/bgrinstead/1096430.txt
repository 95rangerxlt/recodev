Since posting this I've noticed that the menu icon looks scaled down. You can see this clearly in the screenshot posted above.
I think this is the same thing Tim was seeing.  I'll look into it.
I don't see this on m-c with a tip of 0c66a9fd9085 (https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c66a9fd9085) so it must have landed after that.  A likely candidate is Bug 1094509
Weird thing is that I don't see this locally on a build, but I do in the devedition release.  Makes me thing something didn't get uplifted to aurora.

Please take comment #1 into account as well
Copying over panelUIOverlay.inc.css from fx-team to aurora doesn't fix it.  Still trying to track it down
I'm not sure why, but switching 'transparent' to 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)' in this gradient fixes it:

I wonder if it's somehow interacting with not having this changeset on aurora: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3adeab7e472d.

So, starting/ending at 'transparent' instead of 'hsla(0,0%,100%,0)' in the gradients for the panel ui button is causing issues on aurora.  I'm guessing that if we uplifted all of https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-rev/3adeab7e472d it would solve this problem also, but this is a much simpler fix.

I'm also seeing a smaller panel button in osx/windows 7 (but not on nightly).  Maybe an icon change that wasn't uplifted?  I'll see if I can track that down.

It looks squashed, if you compare the icons in the screenshot you can see that the icon is wider on the beta channel.

This appears to be a regression from 1080406, where there is a call to PanelUI.menuButton.classList.add("badged-button").  It's not clear to me why this is a problem only on DevEdition.  Matteo, any ideas why the panel ui button is smaller in the DevEdition release?
