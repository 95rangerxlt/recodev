We were speculating that it's related to the conversion to a lightweight theme (Bug 1148996).  I haven't gotten to look closer to see if that's the case.

lwt-devedition-color.patch

This fixes the issue by specifying the `accentcolor` option in the lightweight theme definition.  The lightweight theme system seems to be copying over the accentcolor || "white" into the root element here: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/LightweightThemeConsumer.jsm#122

Review of attachment 8598206:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

While we're here, can you file a bug to fix the menubar foreground color on Windows? Right now in a non-maximized window on win8 the dark/light theme causes the windows in-titlebar text (for the menubar) to be white/black, but it doesn't replace the background and so the white/black is sometimes unreadable depending on the window color. I expect xp + vista (classic and luna/aero) will have similar issues, esp. if the fog is applied differently because of the lwt-ness... (I forget how we do that off the top of my head)

That's probably a dep/result of bug 1093820 + the lwt change.

Retriggers confirm that this "caused" the permafail in bug 1159150. Backed out.

While Bug 1159150 gets sorted out, here is a try push in which I try to use `rgba(255, 255, 255, .001)` instead of transparent:

There's a lot of orange there, but it all seems unrelated
