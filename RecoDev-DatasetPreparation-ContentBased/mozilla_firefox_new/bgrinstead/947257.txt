Seems to be caused by chrome://global/skin/splitter.css with background-image: url("chrome://global/skin/splitter/dimple.png").  The background-image:none override seems to have been removed in Bug 941673.

theme-splitters.patch

Paul, this fixes the issue - but one thing I noticed is that this override was previously only in place for OSX.  I guess on Windows and Linux it allowed the background image to stay (or maybe it was never set in the first place?).  You can see that osx is the only one with background-image:none by searching for devtools-side-splitter on the original patch: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8341091&action=diff.

The question is, should we still support this different behavior across OS with the preprocessor, or just use consistent styling across the board?
