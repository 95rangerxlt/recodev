In bug 1088861, the console changed to use a new "evaluateJSAsync" actor method.

However servers before 37 don't have this method, so console eval is now broken for them.

Traits or similar feature detection should be used client-side to detect if this server method is available before use.

Brian, would you be able to look at this since you worked on bug 1088861?
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: DevTools console broken when connecting to any previous version, e.g. all B2G simulators, old Fennec, etc.

What do you think?  I tested with a simulator and all seemed well.

Nit: Pre-37 servers don't support async evaluation
