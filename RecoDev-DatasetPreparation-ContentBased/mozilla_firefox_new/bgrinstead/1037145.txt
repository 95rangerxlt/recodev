Having a global binding on the escape key to close responsive mode is causing lots of problems with other places in the code where we bind escape, see this thread for more discussion:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.developer-tools/icxiZWPI3tw

Copying in cases where this trips us up:

Scenario 1:

1. open a site
2. enable responsive design view
3. open the toolbox and switch to the debugger by clicking on the tool
tab or using cmd+shift+]
4. hit esc

Result: responsive design view toggles off

Expected: split console opens, responsive design view stays on

Scenario 2:

1. open a site
2. enable responsive design view
3. open the toolbox and switch to the debugger
4. open the split console using the toolbox button
5. type in 'window' and hit enter, then click on window
6. hit escape 3 times

Result: variable viewer closes, then responsive design view, then the
split console

Expected: variable viewer closes, then the split console, then
responsive design view
