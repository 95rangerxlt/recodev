Maybe it's because of this test:

gcli buttons are not present (this is normal) but like the highlighter button, the split console button should be present.

Maybe we could add an option to the command definition for allowRemote: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/commandline/BuiltinCommands.jsm#2283 and bypass that check if it is set?  Or if for some reason this doesn't work we could make the split console special like the picker button is.
Why is the split console a command button? It should not.

Joe, what's the right way to make the "Split Console" button available when the toolbox is connected to a remote target?

Joe, I think we've talked about this before - the ability to have gcli commands / command buttons marked as remote safe so they can show up with remote targets.

I can't remember exactly how it was discussed so this may not be right, but this seems to do the trick.  The toolbox was not even trying to create the gcli buttons in a remote target, but removing that condition threw errors when trying to set state.isChecked for something like paintflashing.  So I added a flag on the command indicating whether it is OK proceed.

Same thing but with a quick change to make sure it doesn't get added for addon debugger: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=206eb3cc4636
