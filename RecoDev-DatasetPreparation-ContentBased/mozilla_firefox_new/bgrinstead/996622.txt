Not a huge change, just a 1px bigger border and using theme colors from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors to make the changes a bit more noticable

ruleview-changes-pt1.patch

This patch just pulls the three separate ruleview.css files into one.  There were two differences that were only in OSX (Windows and Linux were the same):

In .ruleview-header there was a margin-top: 4px in Windows/Linux but not OSX.  I've wrapped this in an %ifndef XP_MACOSX to keep the same styling.
 
In OSX the following rule existed but wasn't in the others:

+.ruleview-rule-pseudo-element {
+  padding-left:20px;
+  border-left: solid 10px;
+}

This puts the border next to pseudo elements.  I'm not sure why it isn't in the others - I've added it back in unconditionally, but we could add it only in OSX if it has caused an issue.   I've pushed to try it out on windows/linux: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=5aabca06a2d2.

This uses the updated theme colors, and adds 1px extra to the border to call more attention to it.  I took the screenshot from attachment 8406876 with both of these patches applied.

For some reason having this condition end before the -moz-user-select causes test failures like: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=37858954&tree=Fx-Team.  I will upload a new patch where this condition happens at the end of the rule

Excited about how spectacularly I was able to break the test by changing only a couple lines of CSS.  Turns out I forgot to add the asterisk in front of the css to enable CSS preprocessing, so the following -moz-user-select property didn't get applied, which caused the test failures.
