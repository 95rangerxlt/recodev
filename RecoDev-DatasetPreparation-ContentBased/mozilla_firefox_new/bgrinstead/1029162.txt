The autocomplete list provided by tern for eg document or window is incomplete, for example I do not see querySelector or querySelectorAll when typing in:

document.que

...and hitting ctrl+space

( see attached screencap )

The tern online demo page has the same issue, so I filed an upstream bug:
https://github.com/marijnh/tern/issues/347
This was promptly fixed with:
https://github.com/marijnh/tern/commit/7903a4edd0da055409acf0680b998a359c81d45a

We'll get it in the next update. CCing Brian who is doing those.
Looks like 0.6.2 is out on 6/6/2014 (http://ternjs.net/) - probably worth an update.  If I get this done before a new release is out we could update directly to the master browser.json to get the querySelector[All] fix.

Funny how we use UPGRADING.md for acorn, pretty-fast, sourcemap and README for codemirror, tern, but oh well.
