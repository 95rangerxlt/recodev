breakpoint-flicker.patch

Prevents updating the toolbar and firing gTarget/"thread-paused" when a breakpoint interrupt is encountered.  There is a special case for the pause/resume button, in this case we do care about the interrupt.  I've also added a test to this effect.

Nittiest nit: if we're gonna split this conditional onto multiple lines, can we put one condition per line? I find it much easier to read that way.
