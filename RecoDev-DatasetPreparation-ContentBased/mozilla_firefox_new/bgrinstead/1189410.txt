misaligned back-button & loacationbar

The back-button and the locationbar are mis-aligned, as the locationbar's height has been increased. is this an intentional change?

Could be a dupe of Bug 1184097, but since i'm seeing this on OS X, i'm not sure.

Note that the height becomes correct when the window is out of focus
We are running out of time to get a fix in for 42.  This is a pretty obvious issue though, we need to track down a regression range and get a fix ASAP
Tracked down the regression - looks like Bug 1185362
