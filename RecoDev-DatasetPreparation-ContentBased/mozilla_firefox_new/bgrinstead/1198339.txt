Yeah, so we already have a key for this - looks like ctrl+shift+O: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/framework/toolbox.xul?offset=0#29 and https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/toolbox.dtd#14.

Should we just change that to F1?
I think we should bind both to cover win/linux users with F keys by default, OS X users who enable access to the F keys and other OS X users who for some reason don't enable the F row.

Should we allow this to be localized via .dtd like the others?

I wondered the same thing, but didn't do it just because there seemed to be some precedent for putting it in xul vs a dtd file:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=path%3A*.xul+%27%22vk_f1%22%27&redirect=true&case=false&limit=60&offset=0
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=path%3A*.dtd+%27%22vk_f1%22%27&redirect=true&case=false&limit=58&offset=0

Small sample size, but scratchpad and page info dialog for instance just use F1.  I'm not sure the best approach, I'll ask in #l10n.
Axel, should the 'F1' key code for attaching to a help command be put in a dtd file or is that universal enough to leave it in a <key> element directly?  See also Comment 6

Hmm that didn't work.  Wanted this review request to go to Bug 1198404

I guess the right way to do this is to reuse openHelp.commandkey from toolkit.

Which is F1 in all locales, though, https://transvision.mozfr.org/string/?entity=toolkit/chrome/global/globalKeys.dtd:openHelp.commandkey&repo=aurora

Alright, reused the openHelp.commandkey for this shortcut

Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]: suggested by dev tools team for aurora notes
[Suggested wording]:  Bind F1 key to open the settings when the toolbox is focused
[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]:
I've noted this in:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Keyboard_shortcuts#Toolbox
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Tools_Toolbox#Settings_2

OK?
