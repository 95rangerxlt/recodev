This is a follow up to Bug 943306 to allow a way to clear the saved console history.

The proposal is to add a jsterm helper for "clearHistory()" that will send a helperResult of clearHistory to indicate to the frontend to do so.

We have this old bug to alias our clear() helper to console.clear - I wonder if it would make sense to also add this method to the console object as they are related? We could see if the chrome folks were interested in adding it as well.

See bug 659625

The only problem with that is that a web page could call console.clearHistory and wipe out your saved data. (and/or clear your output).  To me, this makes sense as a js term helper (only available when inputting directly into the console).

Great, don't forget to update MDN once this lands:

https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Helpers
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=f7604b7f7cf6
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/e1a7c0e78a9d
Will, could you please add a note for this new 'clearHistory()' jsterm helper?  It will clear out any webconsole commands that have been saved to your profile (a feature added for 39 in Bug 943306).
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e1a7c0e78a9d
I'll update MDN when this is in Developer Edition, unless you need it sooner.

That'd be perfect, thanks!
bgrins, I've added notes here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Command_history
and here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Helper_commands. Does that cover it?
