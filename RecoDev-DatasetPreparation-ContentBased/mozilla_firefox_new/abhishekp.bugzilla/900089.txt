Oops, didn't mean to assign that to me.
Hi Tim,
I would like to work on this bug. Can you please help me get started with it?

Thanks.
Hey Abhishek, that's great to hear! This is what we need to do:

Right above the TabStateCache.delete() call [1] we want to reset the tab's restoring state but only if it currently is restoring. To do that we can just insert the following code:

  if (aTab.linkedBrowser.__SS_restoreState) {
    this._resetTabRestoringState(aTab);
  }

Should you have any more questions don't hesitate to ask here or on IRC.

Nit: the first line above the if statement has some white space in it, can you please remove that?
