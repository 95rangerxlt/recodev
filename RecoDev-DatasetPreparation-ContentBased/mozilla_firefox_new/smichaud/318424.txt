Example that doesn't work
I'm able to reproduce this problem in Firefox 1.5 for OS X (which bundles
version 0.9.5 of the Java Embedding Plugin) and also in Firefox 1.0.7 for OS X
(when used together with the latest version (0.9.5+b) of the Java Embedding
Plugin).

I will try to fix this problem in the next release of the Java Embedding
Plugin.

For more information see:

http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/
http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=7230


I should mention that your URL doesn't work (it doesn't load your sample
applet), and that your download (attachment 204603) only works if you edit
javabug.html's APPLET tag to get rid of its "codebase".

Thanks!

I changed the above URL, now it works.
I've just released a new version of the Java Embedding Plugin (0.9.5+c) that
resolves this issue:

http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/

To test the fix you'll need to follow the instructions in the JEP's Readme to
install the two parts of the JEP to your /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/
directory.  But you'll also need to remove the old copy of the JEP that's
bundled with Firefox 1.5.  To do this, delete the following two files from the
Contents/MacOS/plugins/ directory of your copy of Firefox 1.5:

  JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle
  MRJPlugin.plugin


Attachment 204603 as edited works in fx2003, so marking FIXED by 0.9.5+c.
