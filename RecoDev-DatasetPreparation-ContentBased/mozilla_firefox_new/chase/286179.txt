Figure out why distcc and parallel builds fail on Windows.  My last try to make
this work was on chroma.  The build error log is at:

At the time, I was running distccd on sweetlou.

Parallel builds fail on MSVC builds because certain versions of MSVC write debug
information to a .pdb file per directory.  During a parallel build, 2 instances
of MSVC are attempting to write to the same file which doesn't work.  gcc builds
do not have this problem.

I thought newer versions of MSVC used a different debugging mechanism so that
this was no longer a problem?

Hmm, from config/rules.mk the code appears to use $LIBRARY_NAME.pdb if
$LIBRARY_NAME is defined and <filename>.pdb otherwise.  This code is only
invoked on Windows if the compiler isn't gcc.  Can someone confirm this?

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/config/rules.mk#175

I'm tempted to tender a patch that removes the $LIBRARY_NAME conditional and
dump debug information into <filename>.pdb files across the board instead.  What
reasons were there to dump debugging information from multiple files into a
single .pdb file?  Are they still valid?

I'm not certain what MSVC versions you mean when you say "newer" but we're still
using MSVC 6 for builds in-house.
The /PDB:file rules came from the legacy Netscape nmake build system so I'm not
sure what the justification for a single .pdb file is.  Can you pass multiple
.pdb files to the linker?  Yes, the .pdb files are not used by gcc.

I thought that bryner was doing some work to support debugging using something
other than .pdb files for MSVC7.1 but I could just be misremembering an old bug.

I'll work with Jay to monitor symbol generation and Talkback.  At some point we
should have enough crash data on 1.1a1 to be certain that keeping this fix is
the right thing to do.

MSVC debug build config only, no effect on releases.
Not for 1.8.1. Let's have this bake for a week on trunk and we can pick it up for 1.8.1.1

Bug 382297 - use a single PDB file per library (back out 286179)

Bug 462740 - Building spidermonkey on Windows with -j3 fails: conflicts in PDB files. Related to bug 382297 and bug 286179, where we flip-flop back and forth about this. Document the way things should actually be!
