looks like a tinderbox building problem.

I build for my own use a firefox on my mac mini, using this optimization line :

--enable-optimize=-Os -faltivec -mcpu=7450 -mtune=7450 -mpowerpc -mpowerpc-gfxopt

and it works perfectly ;)

And not having a nightly on a sunday is not a big issue, anyway ;o)

Go and build yourself firefox, it is very simple to do ;o)
Just downloaded the 3/3/05 Firefox nightly for Mac OS X. Downloaded fine, file
size back to normal. All appears well. Thanks to the Mozilla Firefox team for
the apparent fix.
OK, this is fixednow (2/3 build is out)
As of today, there's a "firefox.app" -- trying to unpack the .DMG file normally
gives an error message ("codec overrun").  The third party disk image opener
Pacifist will extract "firefox.app" but what's there crashes as soon as it's opened.

Much puzzlement has ensued among the uninformed such as myself who are
incompetent to do anything about this except wonder aloud what the gods will do
next (grin).

Oh, and the button below "Leave as RESOLVED WORKSFORME" is stuck "On" -- but
that's not true.
That sounds like a corrupt download. Please give the link you are using.
As of 03/09/05 this bug is reoccuring. Reopening bug.
As of 03/09/05 this bug is reoccuring. Requesting bug be reopened.
Seems to be fixed. (again)
Again no new nightlies since a few days. Last nightly is 19-Apr-2005. The
rw-file is missing this time.
This was fixed a while back.  Resolving.


No new Mac nightlies, Just an empty DMG file since 20050226
