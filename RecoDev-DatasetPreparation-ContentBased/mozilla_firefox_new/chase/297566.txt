Additional work is needed for the localization tinderboxen. This bug covers both
Ffox and Tbird additional work.

If this hasn't already happened, the three tinderboxen need to be updated from
CVS with attachment 182704 from bug 287262. They also need the following
configuration:

Trunk Ffox:
@CompareLocaleDirs = {
  "netwerk",
  "dom",
  "toolkit",
  "security/manager",
  "extensions/reporter",
  "other-licenses/branding/firefox"
};

Aviary Ffox:
@CompareLocaleDirs = {
  "toolkit",
  "browser"
};
$CompareLocalesAviary = 1;

Trunk tbird:
@CompareLocaleDirs = {
  "netwerk",
  "dom",
  "toolkit",
  "security/manager",
  "other-licenses/branding/thunderbird",
  "editor/ui",
  "mail"
};

Secondly, the win32 tbox (chroma) needs love. It currently builds the 7zip
installer first, and then goes back to build the raw XPIs without 7zip, but that
means that the repackaging step fails because it doesn't find the 7zip
installer.exe that it expects. I think this can be solved simply with

$push_raw_xpis = 0;
$stub_installer = 0;

Second item first, I set $push_raw_xpis on chroma to 0.  $stub_installer was
already set to 0.

If this workaround does the right thing, we'll need to set $push_raw_xpis to 0
for Thunderbird trunk l10n, too.
Re: first item, I upgraded the scripts on the l10n systems last week to gain
support in post-mozilla-rel.pl for this and to add the default settings.  I
still need to go in to the fx-trunk-l10n and tb-trunk-l10n trees and configure
them as outlined below, however.

I assume here you mean to surround these values with parentheses instead of
curly brackets.  I'll use the latter and place these entries on the build systems.
chroma, maya, and karma have had each of their build trees (Fx-Aviary1.0.1,
Fx-Trunk, and Tb-Trunk) configured with the @CompareLocaleDirs and
$CompareLocalesAviary lines.
Chase, there are a couple things still wrong:

1) the mac trunks builds (maya, both ff and tb) do not appear to be running the
compare-locales scripts at all, and thus don't show orange when they should.

2) chroma tb trunk needs comment #2 (it appears to still be building the raw
XPIs after the 7zip installer; it at least has the same symptoms that ffox had).

Natch.

This will not do.  I put @CompareLocalDirs instead of @CompareLocaleDirs into
their tinder-configs.  Fixed.

Fixed.
