Why not just do |const Cu = Components.utils;| at the top?

|Ci|, |Cc| are defined in the global scope which loads controller.js.
But I cannot pinpoint their defined points.

controller.js is not JSM. Its loaded order would be sensitive.
Thus I don't define |const Cu| to avoid the redeclaration error.

I agree this patch is very negative-conservative approach.

I agree someone points "this patch is very negative approach".

I agree, we should not pollute this with Cu for now, until we fix bug 406371 properly...
