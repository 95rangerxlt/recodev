You need to keep this, otherwise the getter stays in place, I think.

Do you means "not delete 'delete this.ioService;'" ?

Oops. I'm sorry in every times.

That being said, this looks fine to me (with gavin's comment addressed). Dao, is my review sufficient?

Just a couple of minor nits...

You could use secMan.STANDARD here.

I don't think we need to keep this; it's very specifically-named, and https://mxr.mozilla.org/addons/search?string=getPrefsBrowserDownload returns no useful hits (just wholesale copies of the file).

r=me too with those addressed.

Thank you for your speedy reviews. I reflect them.
How about this?

This still isn't addressed.

I guess this is fine too, this is just a compat shim after all (and getter overhead is negligible).
