unlike windows in linux builds the browser component is finally linked against libmozcairo.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/build/Makefile.in#88

Since the checkin for bug 78081 the build finally breaks in the broswser component as libmozcairo isn't found in the browser subtree as it resides in the xulrunner subtree.
A solution for a comparable problem was found in Bug 333874.

exchange $(DEPTH) with $(LIBXUL_DIST)/../ in configure.in for the libmozairo location

I tested this patch also with a "conventional" ff and tb build, they build as well

benjamin, if you think its the correct patch, could you please check it in? thanks

1) I don't see the code you mention at http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/build/Makefile.in

2) non-xulrunner code should not be linking against cairo under any circumstances.

$(TK_LIBS) in cairo-gtk2 builds is defined in configure.in
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/configure.in#4663
as TK_LIBS='$(MOZ_GTK2_LIBS) $(MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS)'
(for other cairo-platform builds its $(MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS) alone, but these are not concerned here)

Therefore, we pull MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS in cairo-gtk2 builds (but not in windows)
If that's wrong at that point we should probably separate gtk2 from mac
in this particular situation


I don't know why TK_LIBS contains cairo. My impression was that TK_LIBS was for OS libraries needed by the graphics system. vlad, do you remember why you added cairo to TK_LIBS?

In any case, I'm pretty sure we shouldn't be using TK_LIBS in browser/components/builds. Instead, use MOZ_GTK2_LIBS. And for cocoa, we should link against the specific libs we need, which is probably -framework CoreFoundation
oop, pav != vlad
Both, ff on top of xr and conventional ff build successfully when I remove MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS and MOZ_CAIRO_CFLAGS from TK_LIBS and TK_CFLAGS in configure.in at the lines mentioned. However, I'm using gtk+-2.10.11 that potentially could pull external cairo for linking, so I'm not sure what would happen if gtk+ is pre 2.8. 
On the other hand we could leave browser/build/Makefile.in alone in this case.
Created attachment 260475
list of $(TK_LIBS) related to cairo-gtk2

attached an lxr derived list of links against $(TK_LIBS) excluding those designated only to cocoa, mac or darwin.
In cairo-gtk2 builds we are linking in these against MOZ_GTK2_LIBS and MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS. If I understood benjamin correctly, we would need linking against MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS probably only in the gfx/thebes or gfx/src/thebes files.

remove MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS /CFLAGS from TK_LIBS/CFLAGS

mostly TK_LIBS is used for mac cocoa and ifdefed. In https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=260475
I made a list, where either gtk2 or all other toolkits are included. I don't see where we would need MOZ_CAIRO_LIBS included in TK_LIBS.
ok, this one I've overseen in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=260475

This patch does not let thunderbird build on linux... Is there something that I should be taking care of?

Here is my mozconfig:
  ac_add_options --disable-airbag --disable-tests --disable-optimize --enable-debug
  mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=/home/tux/mozilla/build-dir
  mk_add_options MOZ_BUILD_PROJECTS="mail"
  mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT="mail calendar"
  ac_add_app_options mail --enable-application=mail
  ac_add_app_options mail --enable-extensions=default,lightning

When mking libthebes.so, the command-line is missing '-lfreetype' and causes the following errors (incomplete list) to occur.

gfxPangoFonts.o: In function `gfxPangoFont::GetMetrics()':
/home/tux/mozilla/mozilla/gfx/thebes/src/gfxPangoFonts.cpp:565: undefined reference to `FT_MulFix'
/home/tux/mozilla/mozilla/gfx/thebes/src/gfxPangoFonts.cpp:572: undefined reference to `FT_MulFix'
/home/tux/mozilla/mozilla/gfx/thebes/src/gfxPangoFonts.cpp:579: undefined reference to `FT_Get_Sfnt_Table'

/home/tux/mozilla/mozilla/gfx/thebes/src/gfxPangoFonts.cpp:591: undefined reference to `FT_MulFix'

This broke my Firefox build too (on Ubuntu-feisty).
Comparing my build log with the Tinderbox build logs it looks like my
MOZ_XFT_LIBS doesn't include -lfreetype.   Running "pkg-config --libs xft"
on my system gives the output: -lXft -lfontconfig
Tinderbox has:
-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXft -lX11 -lfreetype -lXrender -lfontconfig

(FWIW, I hacked my /usr/lib/pkgconfig/xft.pc to fix it)

Mats, Prasad, Benjamin checked in a fix, see bug 388542, does this help?

Yep, that fixed it, thanks.
Positive or Thunderbird too, thanks.


firefox-on-top-of-xulrunner browser does't find libmozcairo on linux



Bug 373535 - firefox-on-top-of-xulrunner browser does't find libmozcairo on linux

Tbird build bustage from bug 388542 and/or bug 373535, always link up cairo libs into a static build.
