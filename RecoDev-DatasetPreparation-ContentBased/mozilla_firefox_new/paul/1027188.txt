Does the marketplace accept bigger icons? If so, there should be no message.
Does the marketplace only accept 128px icons? If so, the message should not say "at least".
"app submission to the Marketplace needs at least a 128px icon" means
"app submission to the Marketplace needs an icon that is 128px, but can have others" rather than
"app submission to the Marketplace needs an icon, of a size at least 128px"

suggestions for the revised message?
What does the marketplace need exactly?

An icon of 128px and any other size, or an icon of a size at least 128px?

It only needs an icon that is exactly 128px x 128px.
So the message should be: "app submission to the Marketplace needs a 128px icon"
