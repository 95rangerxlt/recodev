I'm pretty confident we are going to create a new addon on AMO distinct from the existing one, but let's change this pref whenever we publish this new addon on AMO.

It feels weird to click on this button and nothing happen. The simulator is launched, but everything stay as-is in the connection footer. I'm wondering if we should dismiss the simulator list and display the regular connection footer with the disconnect button, or change the button state of the selected simulator.

In any case, we can improve this in a followup.

What about using Install instead of Add?
I pushed a new version of my branch against the simulator:
  https://github.com/mozilla/r2d2b2g/pull/756

This allows to build simulator addons that works with the app manager!

Oh yeah, I forgot that. I'll just dismiss the simulator list.
This might look weird during the launch -> connection period, but I'll address that later.

I want a short button, and to be clear that it's not needed to install something else.
