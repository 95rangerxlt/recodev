Basic approach: we replace the icon with the counter.

Can you please review the devtools code?

I need a browser review too!
For some reasons, I forgot to add "-moz-box-pack:center" to the pseudo element.
I will add that after the reviews.

Patch looks fine and UI is awesome. I like the toolbar changes. It looks much better.

The :( smiley doesn't show. I get:

Error: NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED: Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsIStringBundle.GetStringFromName]
Source File: resource:///modules/devtools/DeveloperToolbar.jsm
Line: 500


Giving the patch r+ but please fix this.

Why can it only hold 2 characters?

Technically, it can. But I don't want the counter to grow and move all the buttons when it reaches 100. I want the counter to look like it replaces the icon.
":(" is a nice gimmick, but not very informative or self-explanatory. Between this and the counter growing slightly when reaching 100, I think the latter is preferable. "99+" would be ok too, but of course this has the same problem that you tried to avoid.

This part should probably be in a content stylesheet.
