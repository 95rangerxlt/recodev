Windows Users are are seeing alert("TypeError: TopWindow is null");
Seeing this also in Ubuntu 13.10.
Hmm, I am not seeing this, but I've only checked Mac fx-team tip so far...  Do you mean you see an actual alert appear?  Or you see the code alert(...) show up somewhere?

What version of Firefox is this in?
Sorry, I cannot provide more info.  I was running an HTML5/FxOS workshop in Singapore and a few students all saw an alert box with the content: TypeError: TopWindow is null
Okay, I am going to mark as INCOMPLETE for now.  I've never seen this issue myself, and I can't move forward without more info to attempt to reproduce.  If someone else has the issue, I hope they'll reopen and provide STR so we can fix this for real.

Thanks for reporting!
Still happens with Firefox 29.0a1 (2013-12-12) and device on today's master revision.
I do not have clear STR, but various stuff seems to go wrong when you open multiple Firefox windows.
When opening multiple windows, you easily reproduce the empty/gray toolboxes reported in bug 950738.

Alex, I can't reproduce. Any STR?
It is really easy if you stress the interface.

1) To repro the empty toolbox:

Open a first firefox window with the app manager, connect to a phone, debug an app, the toolbox opens correctly.
Now open another firefox window, by default, the app manager will show up in this new window, now try to debug the same app, the toolbox will be empty.

2) To repro the alert:

Open a first firefow window with the app manager, connect to a phone, but do not do anything else.
Now open another firefox window, by default, the app manager will show up in this new window, now try to connect to an app. The toolbox works correctly, now close this window. You get back to the first firefox window, now try to debug the same app, you will get the alert(topwindow is null).

I can repro this issue semi-consistently on Ubuntu 13.04.

Review of attachment 8350138:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We miss a window.focus() call when toolbox-raise event is dispatched over here:
  http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/app-manager/content/index.js#64
So that, the one window that has a the already created toolbox becomes the top level window.
(Instead of staying on the window where we clicked on the debug button, give a try to first scenario of comment 8)

And please call me ochameau, not ochameay :o

Bug 949858 - Make sure we're not duplicating toolboxes and that we forget about them at the app-manager level. r=ochameau
