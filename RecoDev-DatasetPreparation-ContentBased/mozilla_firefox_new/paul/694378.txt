+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #567646 +++

I'm seeing this again - precisely the same steps and symptoms. I had deselected all tabs and windows in the restore list except tab 1 (which was a previous/nested session list)

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:10.0a1) Gecko/20111006 Firefox/10.0a1

1. killed firefox 
2. started firefox 
3. unselected several windows and tabs from restore:session window
4. clicked Restore
results: restore button dims, and tabs were not restored

5. select all the tabs in "windows 1" 
results: restore works

error console contains ....

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "'[JavaScript Error: "winData is undefined" {file: "resource:///components/nsSessionStore.js" line: 2579}]' when calling method: [nsISessionStore::setWindowState]"  nsresult: "0x80570021 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JAVASCRIPT_ERROR_WITH_DETAILS)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/aboutSessionRestore.js :: restoreSession :: line 140"  data: yes]

This is a regression from bug 669272. This happens when selectedWindow is > windows.length. we then unshift undefined to the front of the windows array and puts us in this case.

I should probably write a test for this, but this does fix it. Trust me, I'm a doctor (or something)

would dig seeing selectedWindow renamed to selectedWindowIndex or something more self-descriptive like that. but that's a nice-to-have.

I'm going to keep it for now. I've resisted the strong urge to change any of the existing keys for a while. There are other changes to the format I want to make (for example, not have the indexes be 1-based). I think it might make sense to just do all the changes at once (though that's going to be fun for Sync)
