Right now we set it to 10s. What should we do on CE?

Make it 60s maybe?  Though really what we should do is something like 20s while on power, 60s while on battery.

Made it 60s. That's a bit high, but should probably be OK. When we get the power notification service I think it would be worth making session store like you suggest. I'll file a bug for that.

It's been brought to my attention by sdwilsh that I probably should have put a new #ifdef with the previous declaration of this pref (based on something mconnor apparently said) - should I fix that?
Yes, I think we should fix that for all the WinCE-specific prefs in that block (in a new bug).
filed bug 508386 for the prefs
