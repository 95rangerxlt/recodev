I realize SVG elements have some nonstandard CSS properties but it would be awesome if we were able to inspect and edit them the way you can with regular DOM nodes.

Please let me know if you need a better description.
As far as I can tell, the inspector doesn't currently display any CSS rules for SVG nodes, even the non-specific ones. It makes debugging this stuff a lot harder than debugging normal HTML. :-(

Ah, a simple one.

The tiniest of tiny nits so feel absolutely free to completely ignore it ... you don't even need to read it ;o)
