related to enable-libxul?
There are three night builds for Linux on 12th June in ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly

One is under folder 2007-06-12-04-trunk/, this one is ok;
The other two are under folder 2007-06-12-07-trunk/ and 2007-06-12-13-trunk/, they're broken.
Yeah, this was just build bustage from the libxul enabling. It should be fixed now.
workaround: export GNOME_ACCESSIBILITY=1 before start firefox
I got NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED 
when trying to get sysPrefService in nsWindow.cpp

sysPrefService is @mozill.org/system-preference-service;1
Err... please disregard my comment 4.
libsystem-pref is not registered.
It was moved from dist/bin/components/libsystem-pref.so to dist/bin/libxul.so.

I've no idea how to make it work again.
Do we need something like Bug 339106?
It is supposedly inluded:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/library/libxul-config.mk#247
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/library/nsStaticXULComponents.cpp#161

Perhaps check to make sure those defines are set?
