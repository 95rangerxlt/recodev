Using "Tab" in any XUL dialog, the form controls can neither be read by
gnopernicus. Change the title to include both links and form controls.
Part of cause is regression of bug 168624.
That patch changed atk/nsAccessibleHyperText.cpp and atk/nsHTMLLinkAccessibleWrap.cpp
-      if (parentNode == focusedNode) {
+      if (parentNode == nsAccessNode::gLastFocusedNode) {

-  *aIsSelected = (focusedNode == mDOMNode);
+  *aIsSelected = (gLastFocusedNode == mDOMNode);

But nsAccessNode::gLastFocusedNode is not updated when a link is focused.
