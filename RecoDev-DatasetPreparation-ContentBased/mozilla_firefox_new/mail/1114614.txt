The patch

It turns out that we have quite a lot of dead code since we removed support for the nsIDownloadManager back-end in Firefox for Desktop.

This patch deals with the simplification of nsIDownloadManagerUI. The interface is not required anymore because it is only ever called by the browser front-end itself.

I think instead of all of this, you can use  PlacesCommandHook.showPlacesOrganizer("Downloads");

and basically convert this to a simple if/else since then you have 2 oneliners

this check is pointless, we can remove it.
