The patch

With the timing changes in DOM Promises from bug 1083783 and bug 1013625, browser_newtab_reportLinkAction.js fails intermittently with a high frequency on ASAN builds and Mac OS X 10.8 builds:

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=21a6e1be6cd9

This patch apparently fixes the issue on ASAN builds. Unfortunately, infrastructure problems prevent this from being verified on Mac OS X 10.8 at this time, but results may be available later:

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=47486f8368d8

I believe the core issue might be that the custom test runner in this code doesn't take care of re-entrancy, but I haven't looked into this in detail, as the failure cannot be reproduced locally. Rewriting the suite using Task.jsm instead of the runner would probably be the best solution in the long term.

And also starting the page update listener before the click simulation is preventing a race condition.
