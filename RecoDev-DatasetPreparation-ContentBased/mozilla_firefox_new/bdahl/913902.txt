The agenda for the upcoming summit in Brussels/Toronto/Santa Clara is not readable, because the background image rendered without opacity. I can view the file correctly using Evince PDF viewer.

Steps to reproduce:
a. Go to http://summit.mozilla.org/
b. Click Brussels/Toronto/Santa Clara
c. Click 'Agenda'
d. Click 'View Full Agenda (pdf format)'

Current result:
Page 2 and page 4 and not easy readable.

Expected result:
Background image should be with the same opacity as on 1st, 3rd and 5th pages. This doesn't reproduce with other PDF viewers such as Evince.
