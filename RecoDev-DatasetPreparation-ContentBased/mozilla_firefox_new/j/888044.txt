We should think about the different sizes the window buttons can be with different themes and DPI settings.

It sounds like we could just add code to the titlebar size calculations that, when the size of the actual titlebar content is smaller than that of the menubar + padding. In particular, here:

https://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/base/content/browser.js#4363

we probably want another if block that checks if titlebarContentHeight - fullMenuHeight <= 0, in which case we can hide the placeholder.
It's probably simpler - we can just use some CSS to display: none the placeholder if the menu is visible.
Hi Mike,
I'm new to this, I would like to work on this . Please some one assign me. 
Please tell me what to do first.
I believe Allan was interested in fixing this one, but never got assigned. Let's just clear it with him before we move forward.

Allan - were you still interested in hacking on this one?
I was, but it's finals week and I'm pretty busy... so if Dulanja wants to do it that's fine.

It depends on if the menubar size changes with DPI settings (which it doesn't).

This is actually beyond the scope of the reported bug, but DPI does cause problems like this -> http://i.imgur.com/K2o8zHc.png

I like Gijs's solution, but it doesn't account for larger than regular window buttons (but I guess neither did the code before).
So a solution would probably be to calculate the size of that padding based on window control width. Then have an additional check for window control height (if it's shorter than where the tab top starts, padding will be 0).
Ok, going to let this percolate in my head for a little bit...

Hm, I'm having no luck getting into the state with the massive window buttons. How did you do that, Brandon?

Let me correct myself quickly. The current Nightly handles DPI fine. Changing titlebar text size was what I was doing (I got confused between the two).

On Windows 8: Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalization -> Display -> Make text and other items larger or smaller (I set title bars to 24px).

I definitely saw the same option in Vista and 7. Not sure if Windows XP allows the user to do this.

Ah, OK - I see. That overlapping issue in your image seems to be due to our caching of the original titlebar height on first window open. I am able to reproduce if I change the titlebar font size with Firefox open. This applies to the opened Firefox window and subsequent window opens in the same session.

The issue goes away once we close and re-open Firefox - then, the new titlebar size is sampled, and the proper height is maintained.

I'm pretty sure we should be OK discounting the edge-case whereby the user changes the titlebar font size with Firefox still open.

So I *think* the titlebar calculations should take care of the majority of the cases, and we can still go with hiding the placeholder if the menubar is being shown.
Can I work on this bug ?
Well, I think, I understood the problem ..  but I'm not clear about your suggestion to remove the space below the caption buttons .  What do you mean by hiding the placeholder ..
(In reply to Mike Conley (:mconley) from comment #3)
> It's probably simpler - we can just use some CSS to display: none the

So, this doesn't work because, as people pointed out, depending on the height of the menubar and the height of the titlebar buttons, the menubar being visible might not be enough to be able to 'push down' the tabs far enough to be able to fit below the titlebar buttons.

You can set the "hidden" attribute on the placeholders for the titlebar buttons to "true" (and remove the attribute when the menubar is hidden). We probably shouldn't change anything when the menubar is shown only temporarily (ie when it's autohidden and the user presses 'alt').
> (In reply to Dulanja Wijethunga [:dwij] from comment #14)
> You can set the "hidden" attribute on the placeholders for the titlebar

In particular, this node:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.xul#521

(you'd need to do this at runtime, though)
So you mean .. 
1) add hidden attribute to browser.xul .. default set to "false" 
2) add if statement in browser.js 
      if (menuTitlebarDelta <= 0) {
           // hide the placeholders
       }

I have no idea change the hidden attribute in browser.js file. Can you help me on this?
Sorry for the delays here - holiday happened.

So, akshat - looking at the bug comment history, I think dwij got here first, so I'm going to assign the bug to dwij. Feel free to hunt down another bug via Bugs Ahoy![1]

dwij: Gijs and I just talked this over, and we *think* this is the rule that needs to be added to browser/themes/windows/browser.css:

#toolbar-menubar[autohide="false"] + #TabsToolbar > .titlebar-placeholder[type="caption-buttons"] {
  display: none;
}

We *think* this is going to do the job, but we need you to implement and test it to be sure.

Would you mind trying that out in a Firefox build, and running it through some tests? Test with the menu hidden and not hidden, and then try some different OS font sizes.

Let me know if you need guidance on how to move forward on this.

It is working. :) , I suppose that now I have to make a patch for this. I'm following video tutorial in this link [1]

We're going to want newlines above and below this new rule.

You've flipped the signs in the comment - we're hiding the titlebar-placeholder when the menubar is _not_ autohidden.

For comments like this, we put a space after the first *, and include punctuation.  I think I'd prefer a comment like:

/* Hides the titlebar-placeholder underneath the window caption buttons when we're not autohiding the menubar. */

I don't think including the bug number adds much value in this case.

I mean these two rules:

The comment even refers to both of them.

I don't know, that's why I'm asking. Do the tabs fit under the caption buttons if those buttons are taller than they are by default on Windows 7 and 8?
I got it! I'll put the rule above the existing rule which having a comment like below.

I set the titlebar to 24px. Then there is a gap between tabs and menubar.But tabs fit with caption button. Is there any thing to fix?

The TabsInTitlebar code pads the menubar at the bottom or the tabs bar at the top (I forget which, but I think it's the menubar) if the titlebar is taller than the menubar - see also Dulanja's mention of a 'gap' between the menubar and the tabbar. This was part of my discussion with mconley which led to comment #22 (which doesn't seem to reference the nature of our discussion, sorry about that). So, yes, we should be fine even with large caption buttons.
So, is there any thing I have to do ?
