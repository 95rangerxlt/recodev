Whenever I click menu -> '?' -> About Nightly, I get the following error at the console (the command line console, not the browser console):

JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/customizableui/panelUI.js, line 343: this.hide is not a function

I saw it on windows 7, mconley reproduced it on OS X.

This doesn't appear to break functionality, but we still shouldn't have this - marking as P4 for now.

PanelUI should be the event listener here rather than PanelUI.onCommandHandler, to prevent this kind of issue. This code could move in handleEvent or handleEvent could call onCommandHandler.
