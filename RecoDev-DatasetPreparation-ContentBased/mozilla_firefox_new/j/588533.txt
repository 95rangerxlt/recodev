Bug 568634 adds a set of unit tests for testing network logging on linux. One of the tests fails all the time. The test is checking the response body of the loaded page to match the expectations. I tried to understand why this test is failing but couldn't come up with a solution. Therefore I open this bug to not block bug 568634 from getting going.

Remove special linux handling

I've made a test run on the try server if this bug still exists (http://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/1dc229410624) - the answer is no. Before bug 568634 was committed some things got changed in the way the response body is stored on the httpActivity object. I guess this fixed this bug that occurred with an older version of the patches for bug 568634.

This patch makes sure that all networking unit tests introduced in bug 568634 are run on linux as well.
