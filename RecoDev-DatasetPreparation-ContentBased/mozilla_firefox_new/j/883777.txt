Steps to reproduce:

Open the preferences window, privacy tab. Move the mouse on the same line as the "Learn more" link from Do Not Track section but NOT over the link text and click.


Actual results:

A new tab is opened, as if I would have clicked on the link. This is counter-intuitive.


Expected results:

The link should extend only to the width of the text. A similar problem for another window was reported as bug 414633.

Reduce the width of the DNT preference "Learn More" link

Simple fix: put the label in an hbox.

Reduce the width of the DNT preference "Learn More" link

We should just add align="start" to the groupbox node.
Apparently browser/components/preferences/in-content/privacy.xul needs the same fix.
