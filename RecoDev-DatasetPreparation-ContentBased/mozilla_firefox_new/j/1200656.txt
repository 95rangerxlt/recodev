ToNewUnicode calls NS_StringCloneData which allocated a new buffer, but I don't see where that gets freed in this code. The buffer should land in something that frees it when it falls out of scope.

Jim, what do you think about this? Note that char16ptr_t is of type "const char16_t*" so I had to remove the const-ness of it before passing it to free(). This could also have been written as free((char16_t*)mChar16Ptr);
I'd suggest a couple changes here:

1) return failure up top on a invalid length for aDBPath.
2) get rid of ToNewUnicode and just use aDBPath.BeginReading() in place of dbPath.
Tracking for 43. Does this affect older versions as well?

First off, thanks for tidying up after me (to both of you), and sorry so much fell through the cracks. :-\

Ugh. I looked for a way to get the char pointer and got confused by the "Getting a new char * buffer from a String" header in the string guide, which was meant to only deal with wanting to change ownership, which isn't necessary here. I've tweaked that section to first, explicitly, reference the iterator one (and modified the section header to no longer include the word "new")

nit - Use !aDBPath.Length()

You should never feel the need to apologize for getting confused about our string classes. ;)

Marco, does this fix it for you?
