This is for Fever Dream, which right now doesn't support pretty printing or blackboxing. We want to simply remove those buttons in the debugger if those actions aren't supported, and we specify that by adding some traits.

Not sure who I should ask to review this; past could you take a quick look?

Could you also add a simple test for this? Something like manually starting a debugger server, forcing the new traits to true, opening the toolbox and then verifying that the buttons are hidden.

My only concern is that you are now introducing a dependency to the remote debugging protocol in DebuggerView. We've tried to only make the controller protocol-aware, so if you could move this function there, this would be perfect!

Hi, can we get a try link for this changes ? :) 

Thanks!
Sure thing. https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c7b0ddfba982 This only touches the debugger
