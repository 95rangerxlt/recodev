Steps to reproduce:
1) Install an app in the simulator via WebIDE
2) Open the developer tools
3) Terminate the app in the simulator
4) The devtools are now unusable. You can't close them (via the "X" icon). You can repush the app, but you can't debug it anymore (clicking on the wrench icon doesn't produce any result)

There are a few error messages in the browser console:
"Protocol error (noSuchActor)"
"TypeError: this.jsterm is null" @ webconsole.js:594
"TypeError: this._host is null" @ toolbox.js:234

Can you provide some more details?

What does "Terminate the app in the simulator" mean exactly?

What version of the simulator did you use?  Please provide the full version from Add-on Manager.

Long press the home button, swipe up the screenshot of the app.

Version 2.0.20140918
Alex, could you look at this?  We're getting an appClose event, but failing to shutdown the toolbox cleanly.
Is it intermittent?
I'm not able to reproduce on linux, nor windows against a device or simulator 2.0 and master :/
It was consistently failing, but it is working now with the latest Nightly.
I am seeing this issue again locally.
Me too, it's intermittent.

Patrick, this resolves a toolbox destruction bug with WebIDE and simulators.

STR: 

1. Connect to simulator
2. Choose Clock app
3. Long-press simulator's home button
4. Drag the app upwards to close it

The |hideBoxModel| call will fail, since the |highlighter| actor has already been destroyed.  Without this patch, this causes the inspector panel's destroyer to reject, which skips further parts of toolbox destruction.

Now, I am just ignoring the promise from |hideBoxModel|, since we don't really care anyway.

Review of attachment 8554830:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

r=me for this change, I agree with you we don't need to block anything if the highlighter doesn't hide properly *but* I think we need an extra fix in toolbox.js (probably worth filing another bug): Toolbox.destroy should not stop if one of the panel.destroy promises is rejected, it should simply log the errors and continue either way.

WebIDE devtools stuck if you terminate an app you're debugging in the simulator
