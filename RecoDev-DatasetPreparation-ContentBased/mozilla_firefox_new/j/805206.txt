String or UUID changes made by this patch: none
Backed out in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/5bbfcd1d5296 - Impact when landed: 10 browser-chrome failures.
Oh, and my very favoritest sort of bustage: for historical reasons, Talos treats any run which has the string ERROR in allcaps in the log as a failure, and in Mac Talos other and dirtypaint you were triggering a whole lot of "Exception... "'ReferenceError: separator is not defined' when calling method: [nsIRunnable::run]"  nsresult: "0x8057001c (NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_JS_OBJECT)"
Relanded with the fixed JS,
