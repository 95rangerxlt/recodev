There's no tooltip in the app manager. And we should also add some help buttons.

Add tooltips and help

Lots of tooltips and one help button.

I don't like the placement of the help button, so please let me know what you think.  Also, I couldn't think of a good place to put a link to "Using App Manager".  Maybe that can be in Paul's first run info?
Ryan, look at attachment 804402. I added a "help" button.
Ah cool, I thought that might happen. :)

Don't use xxxxTitle, but xxxxTooltip.

Localize URLs as well:
https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Apps/App_permissions

"Open the Developer Tools in a new window connected to this app on the device."
-> remove "in a new window"

"Save the host and port of the device."
-> "Save the host and port" (it's not really "of the device")
