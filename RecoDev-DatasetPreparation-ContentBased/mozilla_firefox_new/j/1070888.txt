I can't reproduce this reliably; only the first time I open the panel, and only if it's the "right" (well, wrong...) height.

I ran into this when looking at bug 1073240.
Marco, can you add this? See comment #3 as to how this got to be picked up. Thanks.

Huh, I could have sworn that these were defined or passed in to the showPopup function already, but they are nowhere to be found. The default value for these, position="bottomcenter topleft" and flip="both" aren't what we want. It seems that flip="both" and the fact that this is located at the bottom of the browser window has allowed this to exist for so long. Thanks for fixing this.

Considering bug 1073240 got verify-'d, I guess this should be, too.
