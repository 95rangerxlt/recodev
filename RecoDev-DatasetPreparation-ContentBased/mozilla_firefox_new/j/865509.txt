JS Debugger: List 'exception' in the UnsolicitedPauses table in dbg-client.jsm.

When resuming with pauseOnExceptions set, the server may send a "paused" packet whose 'why' type is 'exception'. DebuggerClient.prototype.onPacket ought to recognize that as not being a response, but since 'exception' does not appear in the UnsolicitedPauses table, it treats it as a response.

As a result, the call to this.activeThread.detach in DebuggerClient.prototype.close can end up calling its callback function, detachTab, as soon as client receives the "paused" packet, because ThreadClient.prototype.detach treats the "paused" packet as a response. This may result in the transport being closed before the eventual "detached" packet has been delivered. Delivering packets to closed transports causes an error.
