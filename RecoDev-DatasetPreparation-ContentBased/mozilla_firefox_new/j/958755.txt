As a developer, I would like to be able to connect my Firefox OS device to the App manager via WiFi so that I can debug an app without needing a USB cable. 

Acceptance Criteria;
- Developer can access a UI on Firefox OS that enables a phone to be paired over Wifi with the App Manager
- Must be same local Wifi network? (Paul?)
- App manager has some UI interaction that allows the pairing to be completed

Related to 958753, could be an alternative to ADB integration.

Need to add bug dependencies.
We actually killed that functionality when we moved from TCP to UNIX domain sockets, didn't we?

We did for security reasons. We're looking at how to re-enable that.
This feature is now enabled in Nightly.
