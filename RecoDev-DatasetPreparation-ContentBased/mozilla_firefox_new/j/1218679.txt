We need to add browser mochitests for some common workflows, using simulated clicks, etc.

* Taking a snapshot, changing breakdown
* Turning on recording allocations, take a snapshot, invert
* Something with multiple snapshots
* In th event of an error, can take more snapshots (error can be simulated via action creator, possibly similar to bug 1218678

We need this before shipping to ensure robustness outside of our xpcshell tests.

Handles the breakdown changes, taking snapshots. Still needs something for inverting the tree, probably recording allocations from other bugs, error handling. This is just the core though, necessary.

Should we set the globals to null here?

Can you make a test-utils.js module so we can share this between test suites?

sorry had to back this out in https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=8edcaa544e24 since one of this changes caused test failures on windows and OS X like https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=5401492&repo=fx-team
