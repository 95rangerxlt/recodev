Patch

The preferences code checks for all filetype associations, whereas in newer versions of Windows the default browser association is set through the Settings application which just has one generic "Web browser" setting.

The attached patch matches the behavior of the "default browser" status in the preferences to the same behavior as seen when starting up the browser.

Patch v2

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: windows 10 default browser (bug 1167294)
[User impact if declined]: confusing text within the preferences related to what app is the default browser
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: manual testing
[Risks and why]: relies on the system default browser setting to report if the browser is the default browser instead of checking for all associated filetypes (only changed behaviors on windows 8+)
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none

See follow-up for changing this to only adjust behavior on windows 10+ (bug 1173357)

Patch v2

We want a great support of Windows 10 in 40. However, I am not sure we should take it in beta. Liz will make the call.

Yes, we want this on beta along with the other default browser for win 10 patches - so as not to lose Firefox users when they upgrade.

Needs rebasing for Beta uplift.
Nevermind, bugs got out of order in my queue.

Preferences says that Firefox is not the default browser on Windows 10 when the Default Applications has Firefox set as the default browser
