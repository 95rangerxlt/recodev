Steps to reproduce:

Enabled Bookmarks toolbar.


Actual results:

It appeared with bad padding between url bar and bookmarks toolbar.


Expected results:

Should have seen proper padding between URL Bar and Bookmarks Toolbar. I believe the problem wouldn't exist if one would still have ability to "Use Small Icons" for Toolbar. I believe all of that side effects is caused by Back button.

Stephen, this isn't covered in the spec. How much space should there be between the two toolbars?

fix bookmarks' vertical centering,

This patch depends on bug 930045's patch. Stephen and I agreed over IRC to use a 4px total padding on each side, to ensure the bookmarks' toolbar looks centered. This patch does that.
