Review of attachment 8628840:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These changes look mechanical, so I've randomly reviewed half of the changed files only. I'm sure TRY will pick up error far better than me on this kind of patch.
I've only commented on a couple of minor stuff.

Just curious, why did you move this function out of its original scope? Was it to reduce the complexity of the function and avoid some ESLint warning?

You formatted TEST_URI differently (aligned all string parts with the first part), maybe use a consistent style here.

Yep, the ESLint rules do not want more than 3 nested levels (same as the last patch - there was one that had a similar error). I believe it was a red not a yellow (warning). Should we remove that ESLint rule and keep them nested as is until we can supported chained thens? Or leave this change as is?

Let's keep this change as is.
