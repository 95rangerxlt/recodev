There's a bug in the chrome registry that I can't easily fix, so I want to
wallpaper over it: if you have a locale package (e.g.
chrome://browser-region/locale/) without a matching content package (there is no
chrome://browser-region/content/), and you remove the profile chrome.rdf cachee,
the chrome registry will fail to auto-select a locale at next startup. This
leads to unusual crashes.

This patch just adds an empty browser-region/content package to make the chrome
registry behave.

add empty browser-region/content package

I am not sure we need browser-region locales, but that's another issue.

If this is checked in, shouldn't this be marked as Fixed?
Yeah, my fault


if you clobber the profile chrome.rdf cache, firefox won't start because of missing locales
