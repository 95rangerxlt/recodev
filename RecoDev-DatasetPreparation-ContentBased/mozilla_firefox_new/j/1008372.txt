STR:

1. Go to http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/
2. Open debugger
3. Add a breakpoint on line 7 of app-view.js
4. Breakpoint slides to line 11
5. Reload the page
6. Execution pauses on line 11 (yay!)
7. Add breakpoints on lines 5, 4, 3 and 2 respectively
8. Reload the page.
9. Execution pauses on line 2 (yay!)
10. Remove all breakpoints
11. Reload the page

Execution pauses on a breakpoint that's not actually there, every time. Even after closing the toolbox, and reopening the debugger, execution will still pause!

Similar bug happens to me.

STR:

1. Make some page with some JS and open it.
2. Open debugger, set a breakpoint somewhere.
3. Reload. Breakpoint hits.
4. Close the tab.
5. Open a new tab and navigate to the same page from step 1.
6. Open debugger, verify no breakpoints are visually set.
7. Reload. Invisible breakpoint hits.
Looking into it, will fix ASAP. I guess it's too easy to break stuff with changing only a few lines of code :(
Actually, I just recreated it in a build without bug 799077, and shu said it happened to him when no breakpoints moved. I don't think it's related to that. Not sure what it's related to yet, will keep digging.
I think shu and victor's bugs are actually different; I can reproduce both, but in shu's case there is a noSuchActor reported when trying to remove the breakpoint. Looks like the server shuts down too fast or something? The original bug is looking like something else, and I think I'm pretty close to fixing it.
The bug shu mentioned is a more serious one and I filed a bug for it here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1010552

I tried to fix it, but I don't really know how to. I see where the problem is, but I don't know how to make the server keep the actors around so it can handle the breakpoint removal requests.

This fixes the original bug that Victor found

Nick is most likely a better reviewer for this.
The issue is that `findBreakpoints` in the BreakpointStore is not checking `wholeLineBreakpoints` because a column exists, so it needs to be null and it will figure out that a breakpoint already exists.

Holy moly, I think it is time to split up _setBreakpoint into smaller pieces.

Can we just drop the column property in this case?

I think I'll feel confident pretty soon to be aggressive about cleaning up current code. It definitely needs to be done.

Yep! I will do that. Wasn't sure if it was better to be explicit.

Yeah we need a test (or modify an existing one if you prefer that), I should have originally caught that.

New patch with tests. Fitzgen mind looking over the test real quick? It throws the appropriate error without the fix, and passes with the fix.

C'mon man, we can indent this properly ;)

This test is better now. Not much different, but it makes sure that it hits the final breakpoint correctly at the end of the test.

Nice.

What's the status on this? I'm hitting it constantly and have to restart the browser just to be able to continue debugging.
I thought this had landed, sorry. I will push this through asap.

Not sure why the tests failed last time. The error looks to be like an error in our testing framework. Pushed again: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=43c8acb2689c

Looks like there was a test failing (test_sourcemaps-03.js). I had to force a column to exist in `getOriginalLocation`. We probably need to clean up how we deal with columns, but I think I'll do that in bug 905700.

Just tested it and yes, this affects beta. Should I request uplift there too?

Since it's such a simple fix, I'd say yes.

Some breakpoints can never be removed after transitioning to a new line, even after closing the toolbox
