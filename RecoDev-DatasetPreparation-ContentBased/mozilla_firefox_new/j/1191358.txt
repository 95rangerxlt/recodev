STR:   (tested on latest Nightly 42)
1. Open page data:text/html,<img>
2. Inspect <img> element
3. Set src="resource://gre/res/text_caret.png" to that element (or any other image link)
4. Move mouse over text "resource://gre/res/text_caret.png"

RESULT:
No popup with preview image

EXPECTATIONS:
I should see that popup

NOTE:
After I _Reopen_ devtools, then I see that popup when I move mouse over text "resource://gre/res/text_caret.png"

Good catch.
The problem comes from the fact that image preview popups in the markup-view are only prepared the first time a node is displayed in the view, and never updated again.

The right file to look at is: /browser/devtools/markupview/markup-view.js
In this file, the MarkupElementContainer class represents an instance of a node being displayed in the view.
When it gets instantiated, _prepareImagePreview is called, this method creates the necessary tooltipData to show the popup later on mouseover, but it only does so if called this.isPreviewable() returns true.
And of course it returns true only if the node is a valid image that can be previewed.

In the STR in comment 0, the image has no src attribute when the node is first displayed in the markup-view, so no tooltip is prepared for this node.

We could either prepare the tooltip data lazily, only at the first mouseover.
Or we could just changed isPreviewable to return true for all image nodes even when they have no src attributes.

Here's a patch that always generates new, up-to-date preview when a tooltip is shown. I'm sure we could cache some image previews for some time but that's prone to errors and adds unneeded complexity.

I don't think that last part of the comment is correct. If the element has no src attribute, then the tooltip is shown when hovering over the tagName part of the element only (not if you hover over other attributes).

I think the error is already logged on the server, right?
If so, let's get rid of this console.error here.

Inspector doesn't show popup with preview image when I hover mouse over <img> element. (If "src" was set manually)
