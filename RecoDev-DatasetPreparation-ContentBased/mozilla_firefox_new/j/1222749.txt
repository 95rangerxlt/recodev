screenshot 1 - Identity block has wrong padding-left when forward-button isn't shown.png

STR:   (Win7_64, Nightly 45, 32bit, ID 20151107030439, new profile)
0. Set Dev Edition theme in firefox
1. Open new tab
2. Type "about:" in urlbar, press enter to visit page "about:"
3. Select all text in urlbar, type "about:about" instead of that text, press Enter
4. Press Alt+Left to go back to "about:"

Result (see screenshot):
 After Step 2 the "planet in urlbar" isn't aligned at the center of identity block
 After Step 4 the "planet in urlbar" is aligned at the center of identity block

Expectations:
 It should always be aligned at the center of identity block

Note:
 As I said, that happens because default theme sets its own padding-left for identity block,
 which is ~4.01px while on Dev.theme the padding-left must always be 5px (== margin-right).
 I think it's a regression, I just can't tell which version was unaffected.
 It was annoying issue all along. Am I really the only person who uses Dev.edition?

No, but I think you are the first person who actually noticed the 1px difference and found it annoying enough to report it.

How about we make identity-block.inc.css use 5px and 5.01px? This way things would "just work" even with --backbutton-urlbar-overlap set to 0px.
This patch probably breaks the behavior controlled by this rule: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/a2f83cbe53ac/browser/themes/shared/identity-block/identity-block.inc.css#l73

Nevermind, that code isn't relevant here since the padding doesn't change anyway (since --backbutton-urlbar-overlap is 0px).

I thought it was something like "the first one, who won't be able to take this _very_ annoying issue anymore and file it - looses the competition". Apparently, I lost.
