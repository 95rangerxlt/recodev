When communicating with child processes, there will be more than one root actor participating in the connection, so using methods on DebuggerClient instance to talk with root actors is (as one says in academic circles these days) problematic.

We should have a separate RootClient class for sending requests to root actors. For compatibility, DebuggerClient can keep the methods it has now; they can forward to the connection's original root actor.
