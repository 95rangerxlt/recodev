FBH 1.0 -> 1.0.1

This patch contains all of the changes between FBH 1.0 and 1.0.1 (with a little
extra on the keyboard shortcut page :)).
I think there should be a 'Help' component for product 'Firebird' here in Bugzilla.
brian: See bug 229696.
Moving severity to BLOCKER. This blocks a LOT of things for me.

Fix checked in.
The latest nightly builds since the day this patch was checked in no longer have
any help system (on the Help Menu, anyway).

I'm not sure if it is a direct regression of the patch so have filed a new bug:

Checkin Firebird Help 1.0.1 to the Firebird tree.
