found using 2005022507-trunk on mac os x 10.3.8. thanks to Mano for pointing
this out on irc.

1. open Preferences dialog.

2. rapidly click btwn panels (via clicking the icons in the toolbar) --eg,
General and Privacy-- but it needs to be fast enough such that the dynamic
resizing doesn't finish drawing the dialog.

3. repeat step 2 several times and watch the height of the Preferences dialog.

results: you'll noticed that the height gets progressively shorter. in fact, if
you stop switching panels, you'll get into a state where the dialog is too short
to see to content and use.

workaround: closing and reopening the dialog resets it to a readble state.

I can confirm for: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2)
Gecko/20050227 Firefox/1.0+
This seems fine to me using "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050228 Firefox/1.0+" I've tried it by basically opening
options and then holding the right arrow down to make it cycle very rapidly
through the panes. There was no change in height. I'm using a 2.8GHz P4, so I
don't know if it's just doing it too fast to make a difference or what. I will
try on my G4 400 Mac, which is MUCH slower and see if I can reporduce.
I see this as well on Windows XP, but only when animateFadeIn is enabled.

To confirm, it did show up on the Mac build, however, that makes sense since
animateFadeIn is on by default there. Likewise, it shows up on Windows when that
is enabled.

hmm, fix?

hacky solution.. since oldpane.contentHeight won't be used after the very first
time animate() is called; A real soultion would be to find out a better way to
get the currentHieght (of the contentBox only).

updated patch, v2

This is an updated version of Mano's patch, so it applies on the trunk. It
seems reasonable and works just fine.

nit: space before ?
landed on trunk
Thanks for driving this in, Josh :)
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change


preferences dialog gets progressively shorter when rapidly switching panels
