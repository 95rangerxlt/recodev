Steps to reproduce:

cppcheck found some memory leak in gtscc.c.


Actual results:

These are the reported leaks:
[firefox-src/config/gtscc.c:764]: (error) Memory leak: source
[firefox-src/config/gtscc.c:764]: (error) Memory leak: object
[firefox-src/config/gtscc.c:1247]: (error) Memory leak: archive
[firefox-src/config/gtscc.c:2506]: (error) Memory leak: table
[firefox-src/config/gtscc.c:2506]: (error) Memory leak: dmap



Expected results:

You should release the objects before exit point. 

However, these bugs are not too importants, because the itself a program, and the memory will be released, when the program ends.

There aren't even rules to build that program.
And the rules to do so have been removed in ... 1999.

Someone should just hg rm it.
and remove the reference in the packager.mk.

That highlights a drawback of cppcheck: 
cppcheck does not use makefile (or other rule file), it is just scan all the source files, so it produces warning for unused files too. 

Maybe a cleanup would be useful. Probably there are some other unused files in the trunk.
