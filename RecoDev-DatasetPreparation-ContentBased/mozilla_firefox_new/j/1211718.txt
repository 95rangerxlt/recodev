The initial UI for centralized management of Notifications in Firefox currently follows the code and pattern of PopUp Preferences, and should be adjusted to allow the user to easily manage prefs for multiple sites. 

1. Remove the manual input field at the top. It doesn't do much that is useful. 

2. Change the text at the top to read: 

You can specify the sites that are allowed to send or blocked from sending notifications. Removing a site from the list resets the preference to the default, which is to ask to send notifications. 

3. Toggle each entry in the list view between Allow and Block on mouse click. 

4. Replace the string for button saying "Remove" with "Reset." We could also make the string "Reset (Ask). Another alternative would be to retain the Remove string, but add a tooltip that explains that removing a site from the list resets to default which is to Ask. The text at the top also explains this. 

5. The Remove/Reset All button can remain. 


6. Finally, the Do Not Disturb check box has still to land on the Content Preferences Pane in a separate bug.

The manual input field at the top is how the user preemptively Blocks a site (or preemptively Allows, though more rare). If we removed that field at the top, then we would only be supporting "Remove" aka Reset.
Thanks for the summary Bill! A few edits inline…

This feels pretty long and complicated to me. How about this:
»These websites want to send you notifications even while you are not visiting them. Double click a row to allow/block a site from sending you notifications in the future.«

I have also put this in the mockup.

Let's do this on double click, since a single click into a list is reserved for selecting the item.

Consensus appears to be lower left button string should be "Reset Permission(Ask)" and lower right button string should be "Reset All." 

Should there still be a tooltip?
I'm personally not really convinced that changing the button string adds clarity. Currently it's clear that when I click the button it will remove the row from the table (which is a list of permission granted/denied). It's less clear to me what Reset means… it actually feels more like jargon.
I agree with comment #5. With the address bar removed, "Remove site" will be even clearer.

This capability was already present but we weren't using it. I added a test that confirms that the url field is hidden for the notification permissions but visible for the popup permissions.

Glad this was already supported :) You forgot to replace the "notificationspermissionstext" string though.

Should we add the second sentence from https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/3A4A895XZ#/screens/104947124 with s/reset/remove/?
Sounds good to me. Thanks.
