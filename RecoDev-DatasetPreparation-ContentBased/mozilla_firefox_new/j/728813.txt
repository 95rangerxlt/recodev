To enter safe-mode via menu, there's Help -> Restart with Add-ons Disabled. However, when in safe-mode, that menu item stays the same. Instead, it should switch to something that allows restarting in normal mode.

Relevant code is found in this MXR search:

I think a new <menuitem> can be added with JS toggling the visibility of the new and existing item such that they don't both appear at the same time.

Hi, is this one still a valid bug to work on? I've got a school project that requires us to work on an open source project and I was wondering if me and my partner could try this one out.

This is still a valid bug but I was helping someone with it last night. I didn't get it assigned to them but if you don't find another bug, you can check back in a week or so to see if there was any progress.
Okay, thank you.
Hey this is vandhanaa. Maybe you can assign it to me to avoid confusion. :)

If we're not showing a dialog to confirm the restart then we shouldn't have an ellipsis here.

UX: What are you thoughts on this? It's just switching to the label from "Disabled" to "Enabled" when the user is in safe mode.  Is the dialog confirmation dialog required when restarting into normal mode or should we just remove the ellipsis?

Looking good, vandhanaa.

On Windows and Linux you can disable the top menubar, which will enable a Firefox button with it's own menu (this is the default on Windows Vista and newer). That Firefox menu contains its own "Restart with add-ons Disabled..." menu item - we should have that be updated too.

The menuitem is defined here:

Expected results:

like in FF13 & earlier there should be an option like

3) disable all Add-ons & plugin's and start in normal mode

Resetting does not help sometimes (say just want to reset tool-bars or
bookmarks & nothing else with minimal fuss & surely that the user will not mess
up!)

These are the options which commonly solved users' problems and is better than
resetting Firefox , just add a button to keep the old way too by keeping the
old code( & add a 3rd button) to start the old box(many people find it easy)

(instead of going to the profile & deleting stuff as it is not easy for the casual/home user)

Yes, this is how we solve this kind of problem. We don't have to worry about attribute name conflicts with third-party libraries since we don't use them on the browser window.

Thanks for working on this, Timur!

Dao's suggestions make sense.

I think safeModeRestart() still needs to fire quit-application-requested in the restart-without-safemode case that you're adding.

helpSafeMode.label and helpSafeMode.stop.label should be consistent about whether they have an ellipsis. It sounds like we want them both to not have one, which means you'll need to change the entity name for helpSafeMode.label (you might as well change it to helpSafeMode.start.label).

With those changes, I think this is done. It might be best for us to chat in real-time about this patch, if you have any questions. You can find me or someone else able to help on #fx-team on irc.mozilla.org (see https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC).

I think they are intentionally inconsistent as we show a confirmation when going into safe mode but not when leaving. It's normal for the ellipsis to indicate that there is another step.
And since the two strings aren't together, I don't think the inconsistency would actually be a problem.

I think that when we add a confirmation message as you suggested, helpSafeMode.stop.label will need to have an ellipsis as well.

You need to add some code to fire the notification and check its return value before calling Services.startup.quit, similar to:

Sorry for the delayed reply. Was out of state. I went through the comments and kind of got lost after reaching comment #21. Please let me what all has been completed and from which position should I start working. Also please assign the bug to me. Thank you.
Hi Manraj,

I think you can just take the existing patch (from comment 33) and read from there down. Let me know if that isn't clear enough. It will help to look through and understand the patch to make sense of the comments.
Hi sir,

Ohkay. What I see is these tasks are left:

1. Ask for confirmation when disabling safe mode. I feel a new notification function would be needed to be created for this and added after this

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/nsBrowserGlue.js#777

2. For consistency labels would need to be changed with ellipses for Safe Mode now.

Please correct me if I missed anything or misinterpreted something.

Also sir please assign the bug to me. Thank you.
(In reply to Manraj Singh [:manrajsingh] from comment #42)
> Ohkay. What I see is these tasks are left:

Hello, sorry for the delay. I was away from work for a bit recently.

The confirmation isn't necessary in my opinion since the user isn't going to a more crippled mode in general. We can do the work to add a confirmation later if others disagree.

I think what's left to do here is:
* comment 34 - we don't need to have the start strings duplicated from the existing @accesskey and @label attributes since we don't need to switch back to them at any point.
* comment 39 - before the early return when we restart in regular mode, there should be a quit-application-requested notification and we need to check the return value.

The "restart-in-safe-mode" notification already handles "quit-application-requested" and restarting now[1] so the cancelQuit code above should be inside the new `if` below and the call to Services.startup.restartInSafeMode here should be removed. Inside `if (Services.appinfo.inSafeMode) {` you should just return if cancelQuit.data is true.

I was saying that the declaration of `cancelQuit`, the createInstance, and the notifyObservers should also be inside the `if (Services.appinfo.inSafeMode) {` block since it's not relevant to case that we aren't in safe mode.
