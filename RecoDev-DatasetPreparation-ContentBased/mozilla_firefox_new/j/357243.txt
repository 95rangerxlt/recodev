I can confirm this behavior with:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Even reproduce steps 3. and 4. are not needed, after clicking at "remove all sites" the dialog has to be closed before new sites could be added.

Confirm this bug on FireFox trunk build :
Mozilla/5.0(X11;U;SunOS sun4u;en-US;rv:1.9a3pre) Gecko/2007022801 Minefield/3.0a3pre
Confirmed for Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS i86pc; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061211 Firefox/2.0 on Solaris Nevada. And also Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS i86pc; en-US; rv:1.9a2) Gecko/20070220 Firefox/3.0a2.

It seems to be not a Solaris specific bug as comment 1.

I wonder whether I should also modify the file "Permissionsutils.js". In the function deleteAll, "aItems = [];" seems no effect on this._permission, and I am not sure delete it or not.
hrm, I think the you could fix that by changing aItems = [] to aItems.splice(0), please test.
