I imagine we'll need to disable the 10.5 build/test machines before landing this? Is there a bug tracking that?

Bug 773120, for those following along. (This bug only loosely depends on that one, since armen/myself have hidden OS X 10.5 on tbpl, so the tree won't appear busted; we'll just be wasting cycles/machines)
Firefox 17 is the next major ESR version, so this won't give an extra one-year delay for organizations to migrate their old Macs. Do you have feedback from ESR users about that?

This has been considered, we're not planning any sort of 10.5 support for the next esr, nor are we recommending esr for 10.5 users. Asa know more about this if you want more info.

Does this patch also make the Webapp Runtime in Firefox have a minimum OS version for Mac at OS X 10.6?

I don't know anything about how the webapp runtime works, so I don't know. This patch marks the Firefox app bundle as requiring Mac OS X 10.6.


make Mac OS X 10.6 the minimum system version
