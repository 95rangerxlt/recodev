The patch in bug 347447 fixes this; apparently, the use of native button widgets causes an extra 12px of height to be inserted in the generated box containing the forward (or back) image.  The patch there disables ues of native widgets (sigh), which doesn't make me happy but at least makes the theme behave similarly across platforms.
