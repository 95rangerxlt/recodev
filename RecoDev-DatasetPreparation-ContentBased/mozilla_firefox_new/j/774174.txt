Patch

This patch copies many of the styles from pinstripe and winstripe, but keeps the button looking native and fitting in with the other toolbarbuttons on Linux. (Tested with Ubuntu)

Why is this needed? Should we set pack="center" on the button itself? We don't currently set this on Windows/Mac.
The pack="center" centered the MoTown icon vertically, and it is probably something good to have in case other providers don't give us the exact size icon we're expecting.
