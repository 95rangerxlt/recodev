See this patch for the change that only made these menuitems show up if devtools.errorconsole.enabled was set to true. We should check for either devtools.errorconsole.enabled=true or if devtools.chrome.enabled=true:

Jared, this looks more of a feature change & not a regression. Why is this needed on FF18 specifically ?
The patch for bug 602006 landed in 18 and we've received feedback from developers that they were a little confused as to why the menuitem was missing and how to get it visible again.

The required work for this bug is very minimal and there is no risk anticipated, while the potential win from this change may help to make things clearer since we can just tell Gecko & add-on developers to set a single pref for when they are working on the browser chrome.

Jaws, If I am interpreting it right, this patch would address the last few comments in Bug 798925 & would resolve that bug fixed if uplifted ?
It's not a perfect solution and doesn't resolve that bug when uplifted, but it does make the situation a little better.

Sorry, I forgot to finish the first question.
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): no bug, but due to bug 602006 some addon/gecko developers may not see the Error Console menuitem, but they may already have flipped this preference, so landing this change will reduce confusion for those users.

This does nor require tracking for release, but approving the needed aurora uplift .
