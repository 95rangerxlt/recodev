patch

setBreakpoint currently returns the actual location on which the breakpoint was set as a generated location. As part of cleaning up breakpoint sliding, it should return it as an original location instead.

As a matter of fact, most of the logic in createBreakpoint does exactly that: convert the actual location returned by setBreakpoint from a generated into an original location.

Effectively, this patch merges the logic from createBreakpoint into setBreakpoint. Eventually, once we perform breakpoint sliding on original lines, we should be able to get rid of this code completely, since the actual location will already be an original one.

Note that this patch is based on top of the one in bug 1128918.
Does this patch need to be rebased on top of bug 1123686? You changed setBreakpoint to return a promise in there. Any chance you could do that first before I review?

The change looks great in general, but it'll be easier for me to compare the changes to what's on master after the rebase.

Well I'll ahead and review it. This looks more straight-forward. If you'll add some comments to that one place, that would be good. Otherwise r+. If you rebase and add the comment feel free to r? me again if you think it would be good.

Can you add a comment about this if/else? I don't completely understand this change (why it's suddenly ok to put the `if(actor.scripts.size === 0) ...` stuff into the `else`). Comments on this tricky code help a ton.

I think this will conflict with bug 1123686, no?

I'm not sure what you mean, bug 1123686 already landed a few days ago, so obviously this patch is based on top of that.
Right, it landed but it looks like this patch hasn't been rebased? Check it out: 

-    return {
-      actor: actor.actorID,
-      actualLocation
-    };

That's the end of `setBreakpoint`. If it was rebased on top of that bug it should be removing a return with a promise, no? I could be reading it wrong.

Oh, no, that's a bug! It just happens to work by sheer chance, because onSetBreakpoint is a request handler and can therefore either return a promise or the return packet.

Actually, now that I look closer, it's not a bug. Its just that another patch I since wrote refactored setBreakpoint so that it calls setBreakpointForActor. The former still returns a promise, but the latter does not, so all the promise stuff was removed again. Make sense?

setBreakpoint should return an original location.
