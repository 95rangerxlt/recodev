Combining two minor issues into one, to minimize aurora-uplift-tracking pain!

- The share panel profile information block is only updated on window load, so if the provider sends the profile data after that, it doesn't get updated. In practice, this means it doesn't really ever show up in the first window.

- When it does show up, on Mac, it doesn't look great, because the text is black-on-grey: http://cl.ly/image/081K3H3s1s3J

fix the updating issue

This fixes the first issue.
The second issue looks to be because -moz-appearance:none on an OSX button still keeps the font color black.

See here: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser.css#1270

Either hard-coding white, or some other solution will be needed here for OSX.

Patch

This includes the fixes for both parts of this bug.

The |color:#fff;| is the same that is used by @hudButton@ which is referenced by the #identity-popup-more-info-button so I think it will be OK to use here.
