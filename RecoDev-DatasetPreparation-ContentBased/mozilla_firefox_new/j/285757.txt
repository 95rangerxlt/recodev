Is the pref actually changing?  IIRC, there's a fallback location if getting the
homepage pref horks, which is the Firefox Central URL.

is about:config showing a different value for browser.startup.homepage?
I had my homepage set to the English Google firefox page (forget the URL). I
deleted the firefox directory (20050310 build) and unziped the (20050312 build).
When I opened firefox, my homepage had changed to
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html. In options, the url
changed to above URL. And in about:config see the next attachment.

about:config entry for homepage
-> bsmedberg, looks like fallout from the branding updates.

No override, just build one or the other
Fixed on trunk.


builds with official branding use unofficial branding copy of browserconfig.properties
