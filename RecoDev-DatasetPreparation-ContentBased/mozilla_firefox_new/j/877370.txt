WIP Patch

This patch includes placeholder elements in the panel when in customization mode. Still need to fix a bug with the styling of them and implement the animation part.

Patch (part 1)

This patch puts placeholders in the palette while customizing. Borders of them show up when an item is being dragged, to be consistent with how we are styling the nav-bar during drags.

I'm moving the animation to a second patch for this bug. Or we could move the animation to a follow-up, I'm indifferent.

Patch (part 1)

It doesn't look like the placeholders are being correctly removed in some cases.

STR on OSX:

1) Open up customization mode, and drag some items into the panel.
2) Exit customization mode
3) Open the panel

This is what I see: http://i.imgur.com/TRdN5c4.png

So I don't think those nodes are being removed correctly.

Patch v2 (part 1)

Sorry about that first patch, I should have cleared review when I started to notice I needed to change more things. This patch should get the interactions right, but doesn't have the panel items animating their movement. I think this is a landable chunk by itself though.

Let's put the const at the top of this function. Maybe sometime down the line it should be moved into panelUI.js, but I'm find with it being here for now.

doc is never used and can be removed.

For ease of tracking, I'll move the panel animations to another bug.
