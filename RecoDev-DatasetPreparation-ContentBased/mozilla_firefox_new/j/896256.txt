cmdSetdirManual=A 'mozcmd' directory is an easy way to create new custom commands for the Firefox command line. For more information see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/GCLI/Customization">MDN documentation</a>.

I think there are two problems with this string.

1. Don't hard code "Firefox" (see bug 812762).

2. Don't hard-code en-US in links to MDN or SUMO, let the platform do its magic with locale redirection.

Also another doubt from a non-native English speaker. Doesn't this sound wrong?
cmdStatus=Read %1$S commands from '%2$S'

I think the meaning is "%1$S commands have been read from '%2$S'", like this it sound like a command.

Perhaps also give some info in the empty l10n notes for cmdSetdirDesc and cmdSetdirManual, or remove them?
Joe, are these strings actually used in the product? I can't find any reference in the code, but these two strings are definitely still there.
