The build process currently allows --enable-ui-locale=ab-CD so that you can
build a localized version of firefox. However, this doesn't yet affect the
installer. I need to fix this before the localization freeze after 1.0b

I'm also going to attach a patch here to automate the building of XPI langpacks.

OK, let's get it in the tree.  I assume you've tested the differet products'
installers and suchlike, of course.

Fully localize the installer (readable patch)

Fully localize the firefox installer files. Due to a few file-moves, this patch
is readable but not really apply-able. I have tested both win32 and linux
installers.
Created attachment 156078
same patch, but uses -N so it's apply-able

There are five file-moves involved:

browser/installer/unix/installer.cfg.in -> browser/installer/unix/installer.cfg

browser/installer/unix/langenus.jst -> browser/installer/unix/ab-CD.jst
browser/installer/windows/langenus.jst -> browser/installer/windows/ab-CD.jst
browser/installer/windows/install.it ->
  toolkit/locales/en-US/installer/windows/install.it
toolkit/mozapps/installer/unix/wizard/installer.ini ->
  toolkit/locales/en-US/installer/unix/install.it
Adding to the radar.  would to be good to get by PR but could slip a few days
until Localization Freeze
So, how well has this been tested? :-) 
I have built and installed the firefox windows and unix installers, and tried as
many options as possible. Both the installers and the resultant builds work as
expected. Shaver asked me to build a tbird windows installer just to test it,
and I've been trying, fighting mysterious hardware lockups on my win32 machine;
the patch should not affect the tbird installer at all...
On my first attempt to test this for Thunderbird, the app went into that famous
infinite process starting / process shutting down loop. I'm trying a clean
clobber build now as I doubt Benjamin's patch could have caused that.
Benjamin, this patch worked fine for me with the Thunderbird windows installer.
I didn't run into any problems with it.


Reading news://news.mozilla.org:119/4124bf11$0$12126$3b214f66@usenet.univie.ac.at
do you want to adjust the INSTALLER_NAME var to what came out of that discussion?
And if so, do you want to do that now or later?
Having the build setting the name in the convention we (the MLP) are using for
uploading to ftp.mozilla.org would be really nice :)

a=chofmann for PR
I fixed this, except for the changes to the filenames produced by the installer.
I need a comprehensive patch to do that, which will be a separate bug.


Allow installer building to be fully localizable
