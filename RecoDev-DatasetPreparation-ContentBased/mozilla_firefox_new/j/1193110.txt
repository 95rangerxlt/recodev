Uncovered when landing real performance actor. Originally, we would wait for perf connection during toolbox startup during testing, so it'd be available, and we don't get race conditions when tearing down. Looks like some jetpack tests don't have gDevTools.testing on (why would they?), so was running into this.

Have a much cleaner solution now.

Maybe this should be `_performanceFront`, since that's your create function's name on the next line?

Turns out lots of tests just close a tab without waiting for toolbox destruction, so we still need the DevToolsUtils.testing flag unfortunately, but the jetpack tests do wait for this, so this'll fix that anyway.

Wait for performance connection to complete before closing toolbox
