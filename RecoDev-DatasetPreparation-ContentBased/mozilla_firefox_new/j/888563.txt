Bug 750106 introduces a chrome site identity design, but we need the icons for the unofficial, Nightly, and Aurora. Both Nightly and Aurora are showing the Firefox icons for now, and unofficial is showing the generic globe icons.

It would be nice to have the text color match the different branding colors.

It should already be matching the branding colors. What color values do you think they should be changed to? See http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e24391ffbe7e/browser/themes/shared/identity-block.inc.css#l23 for the color values used for each release channel.
Yeap. I had troubled noticing it with the "UX" but I see it now on Nightly.

Any reason not to also convert these to rgb to match the official branding rules above and the style guide? I had to check the conversions because they style guide doesn't have hsl.

Looks like you accidentally used the Nightly colours for Aurora as well.

I don't see how you got this colour from the style guide? Did you adjust it in some way?

Um... I guess I need to sleep more? Sorry for the failed patch (I had interpreted the values on the color page as HSL but they are HSB). This one should be better.

No problem. It was late when I was reviewing that and I wondered if I totally missed something :P
