XP Classic + LWT -- border on top of window missing? Seems like it's overlapping or something. See also bug 590945 -- when that's fixed, we'll actually _want_ to extend things to the edge (closer? all the way? not sure)

See also bug 879600 which seems like the opposite problem but for maximized windows without LWT.
Not taking for M7.
On Nightly, we deal with this by having a titlebar in Classic mode when restored, which means we don't have any issues. I think we probably want to avoid doing that if possible. Is there a value for chromemargin we could use to get just the top window border, but not the titlebar? I've tried just using background positioning or margins or such, but that doesn't help because the LWT also specifies a background color, and the main window seems to treat margin and padding the same (that is, backgrounds get drawn in them anyway). Alternatively, we could try to fake the border with CSS, but I'm not sure how much I like that idea.

Dao, do you have an idea what we could do here?

I don't think so.

Right, that's not going to work either.

I see no option other than drawing the title bar or faking the border.

This bug actually affects pretty every Windows theme except for Glass where we already deal with it, right?

Looks like it, yes. I've adjusted the summary accordingly.
Hm - I personally don't think this bug is severe enough to be P1. P2 or P3 maybe, but not P1.

Downgrading priority until further notice.
Stealing.

add window border in classic mode,

So this isn't too hard on classic mode. This produces the right result, even with non-default colors. However, this doesn't work on XP modern themes, which is why I stuck it in a classic-only media query. Unfortunately, AFAICT there's no way to get the window border colors for modern themes - the CSS colors I use here simply lieand return grey values (I realize that I'm using the ThreeD ones explicitly here, because those make up the outer border on classic). I suspect we'll need to hardcode something that works for the three XP modern values and put those in media queries too, ugly though it is. What we'd do for custom themes with an lwtheme, I'm not sure about.

draw top window border for XP modern themes when lwtheme is active,

Well, that was more of a pain than I expected. I'll put up screenshots in a bit.

Well, that took longer than I thought it would.

Note that you can sort of see the edge of the titlebar still being drawn on the side borders of the window. It's especially visible in the luna-silver focused window. That's a Windows or Core thing we can't really fix, though, and it happens if we don't fix this, too, so I'd like to still take this.

There's no proper spec for these colors, so I'd at least like to run this by Stephen (if he has the time, hence f? not r?).

Gijs, feel free to go ahead and land and then we can file a follow-up to tweak the colors if necessary.
