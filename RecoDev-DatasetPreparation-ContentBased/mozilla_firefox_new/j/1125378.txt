While we wait for bug 1091944 to resolve, we'd like to have some indicator of the e10s status of the user in the remote-troubleshooting packet. This way, we can quickly determine if the user's feedback in Input (or problem in Support) is caused by e10s.

We should add a boolean flag to the payload reflecting Services.appinfo.browserTabsRemoteAutostart.
Why is "numRemoteWindows" vs. "numTotalWindows" not good enough?
That doesn't reveal whether e10s is "enabled" or not, on a default basis - we want to expose Services.appinfo.browserTabsRemoteAutostart directly.

Worth considering how this value is interpreted, though, given the presence of "new e10s/non-e10s window".

Right, but...

Indeed. Seems like it's more useful to know how many windows are actually using e10s or not, but if we're sure we want the other info, it's not hard to implement. Will try to have a patch in a bit.

Annnnd some bustage followup. I did wonder why there wasn't a test in toolkit for this. :-\

This seems to be covered automatically so setting qe-verify-. Please set back if any manual testing is needed.
