Please see Bug #253046, comment #55 and comment #56.  Please consider this the
"separate bug" suggested in comment #56.

On some sites that provide streaming audio or video using Windows Media Player,
the streams cannot be accessed with recent nightlies.  FF wrongly claims that a
plugin needs to be installed.

Two such sites are:

www.kabc.com
www.nakednews.com





Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Using a recent branch nightly such as Aug 20, visit
http://www.kabc.com/listenlive.asp .
2.  Click on the link:  "Netscape users click here for TalkRadio 790 KABC on the
Internet!"
3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 using 0.9.3 milestone.

Actual Results:  
Using nightly, FF told me I needed to install a plugin.  When I clicked the
button to install,  FF told me there is no plugin to install.

Using milestone, the WMP plugin opened and played the streaming audio.



Expected Results:  
Open the WMP plugin and play the audio stream.

Confirming, same problem here
Hmm, I do get the WMP plugin in the new window that opens when you click that
link, but my tree is a but out of date... I'll update and test more...
Ok, I see it now... investigating.
In Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040818
Firefox/0.9.1+ it still works

Don't render the "default plugin" for object tags, as their content may be what we want to show.
This was regressed in bug 244125

This is a regression from the default plugin replacement bug.

How *did* we miss that ;-)?

Requesting aviary approval.

a=asa for aviary checkin.
Here's another such site:

Thanks, that page is also fixed by this patch.

This is now fixed on the aviary branch.
Updating summary as this is not in any way specific to Windows Media Player.
Using the latest sweetlou build, the problem is still present...

http://omgwtf.superlime.com/rusty.wmv

I still just get the "download new plugin" deal.
The latest sweetlou was before this patch was checked in - tinderbox shows it as
having troubles.
Bug #256713 seems to be similar to this one.

WMP streaming media seem to be ok with the 8/27 branch nightly.
I was having this bug on aviary 20040824, now it WFM

Well I can quite perfectly listen to KABC and watch NakedNews via the links
provided at the top of this page, but still cannot watch this one:
http://skynet.rtbf.be/index.html?pj=1734 (Belgian public TV news)
even after I (re)installed the plugin found at:
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/download/plugin.aspx
I also copied the content of wmpplugin.exe to my firefox\plugins folder, no
result either.

Noting that we'd block PR1 for this, even though the patch is in.

Same comment + the following page appears empty with no display of the Flash
content (EMBED within an OBJECT)
  http://aideab.contacts.wanadoo.fr/demo.html

The Flash shows up in "right-click/page info/media" tab and functions correctly
when it's direct url is fed in manually.

Worksforme, please test with a more recent build (wait for PR1 if you don't want
to download a nightly build).

Nevermind, human error... They wrote embed type="video/x-ms-wmp" instead of
embed type="video/x-ms-wmv".
Here we go, happy :-)
Fix landed on the trunk.


object tag content not displayed (was: Recent branch nightly cannot launch Windows Media Player)

fixed-aviary1.0, fixed1.7.5, regression
