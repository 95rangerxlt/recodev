I've noticed on my local builds (which happen to run a bit slower), that the items in the customization palette will adjust positions as the chrome window padding changes, meaning that layout and graphics has to do extra work.

We can hide the palette or remove it from the DOM before beginning the animation.

LGTM. While here, I noticed those Task.spawns (inside depopulatePalette) don't have an error reporter. Not that I really expect errors, but if you see my point (see also recent fx-dev/m.d.platform discussion), can you file a separate bug about auditing our code so we have at least a basic console.error reporter everywhere? I'm sure add-ons will find ways to break "something". Can be P4 or something along those lines, not really urgent, but we should do it, IMHO.

I was thinking about this more last night... wouldn't it be better for "snappiness" to reverse this patch, and just set the palette to hidden before starting the animation, and then doing the clearing of the palette afterwards?

That could be better if we think that depopulating the palette requires a noticeable amount of work. I'm not sure if that is the case though.

When moving a lot of items to the palette, I can visually see it clearing before the transition starts. :-(
