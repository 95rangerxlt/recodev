We are most likely mixing upload and some other request done while connecting.
No particular exception appears on client/server.
We should probably busify the UI until requests done on startup are done.

Wait for all requests to be done on WebIDE connection before allowing any action

The protocol doesn't like mixing requests...
so just wait for webapps-store.js to be fully loaded before accepting actions.

I may feel slower but it will prevent random breakages!

Hmm, what's the STR to reproduce the issue you are seeing?  Do I need some of your auto-connect patches from bug 1055279?
- Open a local app
- Connect to a device
- and right after selecting the device, try to push a local app [play button]

(in my case it was an app with a significant size - https://github.com/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-Music).

You will see WebIDE disconnecting while uploading the app.
In fact, you've found a bug in the transport!

It failed to correctly support the case of:

transport.send(...)
transport.startBulkSend(...)

in the same tick of the event loop.

I am somewhat surprised we've only noticed this until now...

Patch coming.
