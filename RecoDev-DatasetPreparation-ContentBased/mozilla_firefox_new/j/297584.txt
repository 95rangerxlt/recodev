|pwcsurl| of STATURL struct is LPWSTR, but it's cast to |char *| and the result
is treated as UTF-8. 

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/migration/src/nsIEProfileMigrator.cpp#557

556           // 3 - URL
557           url = statURL.pwcsUrl;
558 
559           nsDependentCString urlStr((const char *) url);

I wonder how this has ever worked....

patch 

With this patch, I don't get any more assertion in 'UTF8 -> UTF-16 converter'
and IE history items are imported properly.
 
Btw, there may be a memory leak here because MSDN says that 'STATURL->p..url'
should be freeed by a caller, but we don't. I'll see if there's indeed a leak
in another bug.
Could this possibly be the cause of bug 235495?
Ah, reading bug 235495 comment 10 and this patch seems to indicate that is not
the case. Sorry about that, please disregard.

Looks good.  Do we need to worry about the memory leak?

update (fixes memory leaks as well)

Thanks for sr. I confirmed that there are indeed memory leaks and I just
decided to fill them up in this bug.

asking for a. 
this is a low risk patch that fixes the string handling in MS IE history
importing code.
landed on the trunk with the following line moved outside |if (|stat.pwcsUrl|)|
just in case statURL.pwcsTitle is non-null for null stat.pwcsURL.

+          if (statURL.pwcsTitle) 
+            ::CoTaskMemFree(statURL.pwcsTitle);


MS IE profile migration code casts LPWSTR to |char *| and treats the result as UTF-8
