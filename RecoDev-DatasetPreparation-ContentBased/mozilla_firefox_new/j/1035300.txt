The CSSUsageActor (/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/csscoverage.js) should mark itself (this._isOneShot=true or similar) if its data was created using "oneshot" and if createPageReport is called in oneshot mode, we should throw.

Finally the "csscoverage report" command should make sure it displays a suitable error message.
