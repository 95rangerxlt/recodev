The homepage in the migration wizard (brand.properties) is set to:

http://es-es.start.mozilla.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla::official

Note the lack of locale in the rls code.

For 2.0.0.3, we plan to actually change the wizard to not set the homepage at all, so this bug might become invalid... but I don't want it to get overlooked so I'm filing this anyway!

Fixed by bug 372902, which removed the homepage url from brand.properties altogether.
This is actually fixed on the branch, too. Getting this off the blocker list.
