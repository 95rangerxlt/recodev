Patch v1

This patch pass an offset aware of the zoom level to openPopup but we could also have openPopup change the offset value but it might break some things (unlikely I guess but still risky so close to a release).

Neil, let me know if you think we should open a follow-up to make openPopup change the offset value.

I think this is better than changing openPopup, as I think the offset should be in the coordinate system of the popup rather than the anchor.
