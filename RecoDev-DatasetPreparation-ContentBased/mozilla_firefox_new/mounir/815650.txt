Patch

It has always be annoying to not read "Allow pop-ups for   " when I wanted to allow pop-ups for a "file://". This patch will show the uri.spec if uri.host does not exist. It happens that this is equivalent to uri.origin and this is what will be used after we land bug 815640.

Nit: we can do [uri.host || uri.spec]
