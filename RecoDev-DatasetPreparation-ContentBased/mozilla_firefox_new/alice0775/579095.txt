I remember this used to be a problem with the new Strata theme conflicting with Fission progress bar.  The author (Ben Evans) told me the new version of the theme will contain Larry UI fully functional again.

Whatever the situation is, this is a major part of the security UI and this must be fixed.

Affecting Firefox 4.0 beta1.

Could you be more specific? I certainly see larry and 'You are connected to mozilla.org run by (unknown) Verified by: Equifax' in nightlies and b1 on Windows.

Are you saying Larry doesn't work with some particular theme or extension?

Screenshot, the Stata theme, not showing the name

The same for just Domain Validated (DV) sites - the blue UI, instead only the domain name should be shown.
What is the Stata/Strata theme? Is it something shipped with Firefox, or a third-party theme available from AMO?
Strata is name of the new theme shipped with new Fx versions.  See https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2010-01-11#Firefox
"Strata" is an old preview of what the default theme would be. Most of the relevant changes have landed on trunk now. Larry certainly works with the current default Firefox theme on Windows trunk, so I think this bug is invalid.
Yeah, I'm still confused about whether this bug is with the default configuration of Firefox 4.0b1, or Firefox 4.0b1 with a separate installed theme.
Hmm... now it suddenly works for me in either Fx 4 beta1 and trunk build.  

There has been no installed theme in either of profiles I use for those versions.  Pity I didn't make a screen shot before...

Let's close this bug for now, but I'll keep track of this.

Screenshot, Fx 4 not working...

I found a tab where the domain is missing.  Also when I open a new tab in this window and load an EV site, the name is not displayed.  In a new blank window the names/domains are displayed correctly...

Nothing in error console.

After restart all is correct.

Just to note:  the affected window was the first open after I installed and ran Fx4b1.

Without confirmation of somebody else seeing the same problem I can't block on this. Please renominate if we get external confirmation.
I've seen this.
STR with Firefox 3.6.8:
- have open some ssl pages, e.g. this bug and few other, in my case a secure page was at the first tab
- change theme to Strata40
- restart
- secure pages don't have DV/EV info in the URL bar
Ugh, this is broken on branches?
We're still talking about a non-default theme on branches, right? If that's the case, it's certainly not a branch-blocking bug.
We're talking about steps to reproduce that involve installing a theme. That doesn't mean that it's a bug in that particular theme, though -- especially since we've seen this bug on trunk with the default theme.
Is 3.6.8 (3.6.7) the first branch release with the problem, or has this been a problem for a while?
I am not sure whether the following step expresses a problem definitely,

On Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b3pre) Gecko/20100726 Minefield/4.0b3pre ID:20100726040625

[STR]
1.Start Minefield with New profile
2.Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=579095
3.Open New Tab as 2nd tab and Selected this tab
4.Customize Toolbar
5.Done (close dialog)
6.Switch tab of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=579095

9.Reload the tab or load the other EV site

[Actual]
No domain name appears in step 8 and step 9 also

I think that this is problem of constructor of xbl.

A note: I can see this and STR from comment 13 is (for me) valid only with Strata40 theme, that is not default on branches.

What's described in comment 18 may and may not be this bug.

Alice, do you have any idea why that would solve it and how exactly the current code is broken?

I can not explain, but example will help.

failing:  hidden and elm.value=xx
success:  collapsed and elm.value=xx
success:  hidden and elm.setAttribute("value", xxx )
Thanks Alice.
