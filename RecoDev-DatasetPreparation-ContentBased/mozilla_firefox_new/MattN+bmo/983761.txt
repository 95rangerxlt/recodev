Screenshot of blurry middle top line

browser-lightweightTheme.css needs to use the 2x image on OS X or it looks blurry in the middle of the tab with a LWT.

v.1 Add support for CSSGroupingRules in LightweightThemeListener

I needed to add support for CSSGroupingRules otherwise we would throw an error in updateStyleSheet and wouldn't handle the media query rules.

So, this is fascinating. As a change, it seems OK to me, so r+

I'll just note that _modifiedStyles is now a dense instead of a sparse array, and that the code assumes that the stylesheet doesn't change except by what it itself is doing (but so did the previous code, I guess). As nobody else seems to rely on this internal array, that should be fine, but we've seen other people being broken by changes we made to LWT internals, so proceed with caution.

Assuming you've tested this and aspect ratios are fine and so on, rs=me

Yeah, this may break if an extension modifies the stylesheet programmatically rather than overlaying the URI but that was true with the previous code too.
