When the Browser Toolbox is opened it gets added to the dock with the same name and icon as the process it's debugging, so it's a bit hard to tell the difference from a glance.

It'd be cool if there was a little badge around the icon and if the title was 'Browser Toolbox - brandShortName' or similar.

Or it could follow Linux/Windows where the window seems grouped with the main process and is titled as - "Debugger - chrome://browser/content/browser.xul".

v.1 Use nsIMacDockSupport.badgeText

Here is a quick hack to solve the problem. I realize it may not be ideal but since this is only for users of the Browser Toolbox, I think this is good enough for a first step. We can have a follow-up to use [NSApp setApplicationIconImage:] in the future if we want.

Clever idea, that does distinguish the icon...  Though mostly just because of the red bubble that the icon is inside, as I can barely tell what the icon is here.  (I am on 10.9, maybe it looks different in 10.10.)

The code seems fine to me.  I don't really feel strongly about the approach taken here.  If Brian likes this solution, then it seems fine to me!

Do you know if there is a particular reason why the BT shows up as a separate dock icon on OSX but remains grouped with the main process in windows/linux task bars?  Is that just how these things work, or is there specific code causing it to be so?

I am not aware of any Firefox code specifically trying to keep it separate.

My guess was that Linux / Windows are grouping by process name, while OS X chooses to present as two icons since they are separate apps, but I don't know for sure.

Matt, do you know how this works?
I had the same assumption. Sometimes it can also matter what the process tree looks like. It could work on other OSs since the new Firefox process is launched as a child of the original.

I quickly looked for APIs to tell OS X to treat them as one dock icon but I didn't see answers for that.

I love the idea and the fact that it's 2 lines of code.  My only concern is that the badge may be confusing and look like the window is asking for attention since it's usually used for notifications.  And the icon isn't very readable - I think it's because of that ugly red gradient background.  However, the browser toolbox is used by a pretty small group of people who will let us know if that's a problem.

Regarding the icon readability, I've tried a variety of other unicode 'tool' symbols and nothing is really easy to read.  Using text like "Tools" looks better, but then we have localization issues.  The only other things I thought of is ">>" sort of like the webconsole input symbol, or ▶ like the debugger play button.

I like ▶ personally just because it's so much easier to see.  Matt / Ryan, any preference?  My instinct is let's land it like that and send something out to the mailing list.  If we come up with some better way in the future we can change it then.  From what I understand actually swapping the icon would be possible, but a lot more work.
Yeah, ▶ looks the best of the 3 options there.

I agree it seems fine to try this for now, and tweak down the road.

After further discussion with bgrinstead, I decided to implement both the paused and play states since I thought that always showing the play icon could be confusing.
