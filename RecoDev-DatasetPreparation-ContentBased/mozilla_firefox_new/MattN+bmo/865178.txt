Lightweight theme styling is needed for OS X similar to bug 823180 for Windows.  The main change involves keeping borders between the navbar and tabs when a theme is applied.

Stephen, since we use a solid color for for the selected tab on OS X, I wasn't sure what color and opacity should be used on the selected tab and toolbars below when lightweight themes were applied. Can you think of other differences from the Windows LWT approach? Thanks! Otherwise I have this mostly working.

That should have been bug 813786 in comment 0 for Windows LWT support in Australis.

Persona OSX - Light

It should look pretty much the same WRT to the tab strip.

IIUC, shorlander said we can use the same color and opacity as Windows for the toolbar and selected tab.

v.1 Simplify toolbar borders and prevent overlapping

Note the copy that Splinter will not show properly:
copy from browser/themes/windows/browser-lightweightTheme.css
copy to browser/themes/osx/browser-lightweightTheme.css

I got rid of the overlapping 2px of toolbars because:
* the overlap became visible with the LWT semi-transparent overlay
* it's simpler IMO
* aligns with the Windows implementation

How are the animation perf numbers on OS X?

Latest patch applied to UX

This patch has bitrotted. After manually de-bitrotting, this is what I'm getting with a lw-theme applied. Something is up with this patch...

Please see the screenshot I just posted.

I'm rebuilding on top of latest UX so I haven't seen the problem from the screenshot yet but the patch applied without fuzz for me.
I am definitely getting patch fuzz using a recent pull of UX:

v.1.1 Fix regression caused by bug 850918

Rebased with a regression fix for bug 850918 which I believe is what was shown in the screenshot.

I'm doing an opt build now and will post the numbers.
Perf numbers (see bottom for OS X):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Av64yYvszN34dDdZX0FYWEd3MVpEVzdjYXlFcGpUQmc&single=true&gid=4&output=html

Comparing m-c and UX:
Frame intervals are essentially the same across the board. It seems like bug 676241 will help a little bit too.
Paint times increased for tab open without a LWT but decreased slightly for tab open and close with a LWT. It seems like the performance is acceptable to proceed for now. Note that there seems to be more noise than with Windows.

Dragging a tab on OSX

With this latest patch, dragging the tab doesn't cause anything to be drawn for the background. I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that this isn't intentional. :)

v.2 Fix tab drag

This fixed the tab drag issue by making OS X work like Windows and Linux do.

I added the new define because we could assume the same gradient worked for both LWT and non-LWT on Windows/Linux but this is not the case on OS X where the gradient is opaque without a LWT.

I tested that this didn't regress Windows with or without a LWT and with scaling.

v.2 Fix tab drag

This looks good to me.

I tested this on Ubuntu, and noticed that the selected tab background is still stretched - but then I also found out that it's that way with or without your patch. So something is still kinda screwy, but it's not this patch's fault.

I'll file a bug for the Linux theme stuff.

Great job on this.

Why does the gradient need to be opaque without a LWT?

It doesn't need to be opaque but unlike Windows/Linux, the gradient doesn't need to overlay -moz-dialog. That's also how the gradient was specified in the spec and it seemed easier to maintain as one gradient instead of two layers.

It may be possible to come up with a gradient and base color such that the gradient works for the LWT and non-LWT case but the look may not be desired.
