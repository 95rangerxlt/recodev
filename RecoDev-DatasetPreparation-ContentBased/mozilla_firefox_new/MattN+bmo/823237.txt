This now seems to only happen between the last tab and the new tab button, AFAICT.

Patch

So the problem seems to be that the clip paths that were updated in bug 856749 were only for the tabs, and not for the new tab button (which has a separate clip path because it only has 1 element rather than the two side elements). This is an update for the clip path of the new tab button.

You can sort of see the problem outlined here happen on OS X as well if you select any but the last tab, and hover between the last tab and the new tab button - there's a gap there, where neither the tab nor the button gets hover. This change to the clip path should fix that without adversely affecting clicking on the right edge of the last tab (ie, the new tab button shouldn't overlap the last tab).

It works in my testing on OS X, I've fired off a try build to see if this really fixes the win32 issues: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=fee55d609946 .

I agree that it's only the new-tab button that causes this, but I just tested this patch, and the behaviour still persists in Windows 7.

Dolske was able to repro this yesterday between a background and selected tab on OS X too.
I'm having no luck reproducing dolske's issue on my MacBook. Could this be another Retina-only bug?

Sorry, I think he might not have been in the delayed animation phase when we were looking at the pointer-events and his cursor may have been on the selected tab side of the gap which means it's correct that there is no hover feedback.

RTL does need to be addressed though.

Screenshot of clip-path from attachment 742478

UX team: What should the clip-path look like on the new tab button when there is no overflow? Having pointer-events on the side adjacent to the tabs prevent the tabs from resizing prematurely upon closing.  Should we make the top of the clip-path extend horizontally to the middle of the curve like we do on tabs?

Gijs: If that screenshot is actually what the patch uses, can you make the top-left corner use straight line segments with a right angle.

(if we think having it straight on both sides is a serious problem, we could use a separate clip-path for the RTL case and only have it straight on one side, but I don't think that that is worth the added complexity)

How did you choose the point at which the curve switches to become a vertical line? Did you just use the existing point in the curve or did you ensure that the clip-path lines up with the tab separator? Did you make sure that the rectangular top portion doesn't overlap the adjacent tab for a few pixels?

I attempted to do the last of those. However, I believe shorlander is looking at what to do here, so I'd like to wait for that. In any case, I suppose ideally we'd have separate paths for the LTR/RTL cases so that the clip path matches the curve on the side not adjacent to the tab.

Patch with two paths

Here's a JSBin with these two paths and the original for comparison, scaled up 5x: http://jsbin.com/egunom/2/edit

I've made these touch the tab separator as narrowly as I can, and extend to the top of the browser window. They'll also work at 200% DPI.

(note that there's some interesting visual illusion going on that makes them seem of different sizes; if you use the 'top' to overlay them, you'll see that they're really the same size)

Aligned this to match up with the tabs and not overlap. Note that the bottom left still overlaps, but that's not a regression and if we want to fix that IMHO it should be done separately.

MN v.1 Screenshot of forced :hover

The straight segment begins at 14.5px from the left because 15px (half curve width) left s small gap in pointer-events (perhaps due to rounding?). I tested for gaps in pointer-events with Windows MouseKeys and didn't find any problems.

I'm confused, because when compared to the previous clippath, it looks like the left curve was moved: http://jsbin.com/egunom/4/edit

Was that intentional, or am I missing something?

That was intentional and what I was referring to when I told you on IRC that the old clip-path wasn't symmetrical. IIRC, your clip-path also appeared shifted in the same way when I compared. I'm fairly confident my clip-path is has the rectangles starting at 14.5px from both sides. In other words, I think the old clip-path was misaligned/wrong. I remembered the width was 65px at one point in my patch queue so that could explain why it's shifted.

FTR, the coordinates were the following with userSpaceOnUse:
﻿m 14.5,0 0,13.21875 c -1.031556,3.837524 -1.325,7.898438 -3.25,11.5625 C 9.66,27.99375 5.87,29.13 2.5,29 L 0,31 66,31 63.5,29 c -3.37,0.13 -7.16,-0.99875 -8.75,-4.21875 -1.925,-3.57 -2.205469,-7.705869 -3.25,-11.5625 L 51.5,0 z

Note the 14.5 and 51.5 (66-14.5) x-coordinates.
