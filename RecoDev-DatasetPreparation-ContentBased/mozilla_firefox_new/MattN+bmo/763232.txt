Firefox Nightly preferences -> Advanced -> Updates: Nightly updates.

Steps to reproduce:

Select the second (Check for updates) or third (Never check for updates) option.
Close the preferences window.
Reopen the preferences window.

Actual results:
"Automatically install updates" always it appears as selected.

Expected results:
"Check for updates" it must appears selected.
or
"Never check for updates" it must appears selected.

Reproducible: always.

Firefox Nightly of May 17 2012 work correctly.
The later versions have this problem.

Important: if I selected "Never check for updates" (or Check for updates) appears selected "Automatically install updates" but Firefox Nightly does not automatically install updates.
The preference chosen by the user is displayed incorrectly but respected.

I add that this bug affects Firefox 16, but also Firefox 15.
Thanks for the report. This seems pretty bad, actually.

Only occurs on Linux, does not occur on Mac or Windows.

Can't change the default update settings in Preferences. The default option always remains selected after updating

Bug 706292 was only for the add-ons manager which shouldn't affect application update.

Iceberg, are you using the new in-content preferences (browser.preferences.inContent = true)?

Just looked and didn't notice any changes to the Firefox preferences code but it is important to note that this is a bug in the Firefox preferences pane and that both the add-ons manager and application update preferences are on the same preferences pane.
(In reply to Matthew N. [:MattN] from comment #6)

> Iceberg, are you using the new in-content preferences
> (browser.preferences.inContent = true)?

This bug occurs in both cases.

browser.preferences.inContent = false
and
browser.preferences.inContent = true
This is still an issue on Linux - Firefox 15 is affected. Testing shows that the selected option from Updates is applied, but not remembered in Preferences.

This rules out bug 706292. I can bisect more on inbound next week, but bug 317190 looks the most likely to trigger this. Christian and jaws, do you think this is possible?
Requesting tracking-firefox-15 since this seems to be caused by bug 317190 and users who disabled automatic updates won't have a way to re-enable them (and vice versa).  The problem is that getService(Components.interfaces.nsIShellService) throws on Linux and bug 317190 now calls that during init of the advanced pane.  Workaround patch coming soon.

> The problem is that getService(Components.interfaces.nsIShellService) throws on Linux

Looks like bug 297841 was once filed for that.

I can reproduce this bug on Ubuntu using Nightly. The version of Firefox that comes with Ubuntu does not show any errors when clicking the "Check now" button though.
Tracking for 15, but also 16 since we'll want to have clear tracking that this gets resolved across all branches.

v.1 Catch exception getting shell service and disable/hide usage of it when unavailable

The helper catches the exception and when no shell service is returned I do the following since they don't work anyways: 
* hide the button to set the browser as the default
* disable the checkbox to check if the browser is the default on every startup

This observer isn't being used for any other topics so we shouldn't need this check here.

Is there enough time between the setting of the pref and the calling of updateSetDefaultBrowser() for this to work? I think you should also add a test case for the other state as well.

Please use registerCleanupFunction(function() { ... }) to guarantee that the pref is cleared.

this test (the in-content one) should probably switch to the advanced pane before starting the test though.

Matt, are you going to land this and request aurora/beta approval?
It was near the top of my to-do list but other high priority stuff has been keeping me busy.

Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): 317190
User impact if declined: The user's app update pref UI won't reflect their current value.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Tested on my Fedora build. Just landed on m-i.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low risk switch to using a helper function to get the app shell service like other code already uses. Possible risk that this patch also throws an exception and we're back to where we started.
