Tab label difference

The design specs of Australis shows that the tab label and the close button are vertical aligned. In the currenct UX build the text a few pixel down.

I've attached a screenshot for comparison.

I thought I got this right in bug 826689 by overlaying the mockup on my screenshot but I believe that's because I used the live mockup as the reference and it differs from the image mockup.
Stephen, which mockup is correct? If the image is correct, extra bonus points for fixing the live mockup :)
I've seen in the meeting notes a link to a recent design spec:

Maybe this helps.

Unfortunately getting Photoshop text to line up exactly with platform text is not exact :)

If we move it up 1px on UX it should be about right.

v.1 Move tab label up 1px

Despite the fact that the margin value is changing by 2px, it's only visually shifting by 1px.
