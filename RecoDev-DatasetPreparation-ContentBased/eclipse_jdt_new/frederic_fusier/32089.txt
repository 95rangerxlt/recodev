When using <right-click> "Source|Add javadoc comment" for a method that is
preceeded by // style comments, the javadoc comment is incorrectly placed above
the // comment.

Sample program:

/**
 *
 */
public class JavadocTest {
   private int test = 0;
   
   //=============================
   // a plain comment
   //=============================
   
   public int getTest() {
      return test;
   }

}

Steps to reproduce:
Move the cursor into the getTest() method, right click, select Source|Add
javadoc comment. 

Results: the Javadoc comment is placed above the first // comment.

Expected: The javadoc comment should be placed between the method and the //
comment.

Not critical for 2.1. 
JavaCore assigns the comment to the method, even there is a newline inbetween.

Reopen to close as it's fixed since 3.0
Many improvements have been made during 3.0 development about comments
management in JDT/Core (CommentRecorderParser, DefaultCommentMapper classes).
I guess that this fixed this problem as now line comments are no longer attached
to the method.
Functionality Source->Add javadoc commment works now properly since 3.0 in this
case and you get following code after using it:

public class Test {
	private int test = 0;

	//=============================
	// a plain comment
	//=============================

	/**
	 * @return
	 */
	public int getTest () {
		return test;
	}


}
