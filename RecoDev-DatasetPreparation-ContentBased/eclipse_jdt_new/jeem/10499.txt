How do I access the IMethodBinding of the constructor represented by a 
ClassInstanceCreation node ? We need this method binding since a constructor 
can throw exceptions.

I think there should be a method resolveBinding() -> IMethodBinding.

How do I access the IMethodBinding of the constructor represented by a 
ClassInstanceCreation node ? We need this method binding since a constructor

Agreed. There is no way to get a binding for the constructor being invoked.
Presumably the same concern applies to ConstructorInvocation
and SuperConstructorInvocation as well.

I suggest calling the method 
   resolveConstructorBinding() -> IMethodBinding
to make it clear what it is for.

For a ClassInstanceCreation expression that declares an anonymous
class, which constructor binding is expected:
(a) the 'anonymous constructor' (JLS 15.9.5.1) of the anonymous class,
or (b) the constructor on the direct superclass.


IMO the method should return the binding of the anonymous constructor
Are you aware that this binding can contain synthetic arguments? Is this ok for 
you?
Can you give me an example
I was wrong. The synthetic arguments are not in the binding. I tried several 
examples that use this$0 or other type of synthetic argument and I don't get 
them in the binding parameter types. So it is fine.
I released changes that should return the proper method binding.

Fixed and released in HEAD.


DOM/AST: need a way to access the IMethodBinding of a ClassInstanceCreation



Update for 10499 and 10496 

Add resolveConstructorBinding (bug 10499)
