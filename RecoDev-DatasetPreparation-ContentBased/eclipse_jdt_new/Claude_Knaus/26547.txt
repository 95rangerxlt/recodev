Trying to add strings around an existing identifier is highly annoying when the 
Automatically close Strings option is set.
For example, when I try to add Strings around: System.out.println(a) before a 
then I get two quotes. I suggest the rule to not close a string when there is a 
letter that belongs to an identifier to the left or right.

the same rule should be used for digits,i.e., do not close quotes before or 
after a digit.

A similar "identifier" rule should be used for auto closing of ().

foo(^a)  typeing "(" at ^ should NOT add a closing parenthesis
foo(a^) typeing "(" at ^ should add a closing parenthesis 

I agree.
