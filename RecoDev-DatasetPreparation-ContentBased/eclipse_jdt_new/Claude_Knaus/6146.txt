Another issue is that some mnemonics are used twice. For example 'c' is used 
for the "Change" text font and for the Colors page. So pressing c on the first 
page always activates the Color page. 

Aditionally "Matching bracket highlight color ..." should be disabled when 
Hightlight matching bracket is disabled.

Java Editor Preference Page is missing most of the mnemonics
