In Templates I can define and use Templates using actual date and time. The 
format inserted is a wrong american format. Because I cannot find any 
preferences to force a format, I assume that you get the format from the OS. In 
my OS (Systemsteuerung - Ländereinstellung in engl. perhaps Controlpanel - 
Country...) I used German as Default Country and the format to date and time 
respectively.
