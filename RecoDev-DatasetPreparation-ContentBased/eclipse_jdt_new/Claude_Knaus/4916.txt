Comments from Adam Kiezun:

SEVERE: 
1. go to template pref page.
2. select the first one
3. edit the name - empty the field and then put a single space
whole IDE freezes (infinite loop?)

For some reason on W2K, the a SelectionChangedEvent is sent from the table 
viewer when the user starts typing a space in the name field of the template.
The listener for SelectionChangedEvent then tries to reset the name field
which again triggers the selection to be changed in the table viewer, 
causing an infinite flow of events. These SelectionChangeEvents are not 
generated on Linux, so I assume it's an SWT issue.
