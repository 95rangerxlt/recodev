Build 20011114 - self-hosting scenario

When using the open on type dialog, and enter 'Parser', you will get at least
3 entries for Parser, which are surprisingly not gathered in one set. This 
seems to be caused by the fact the second is an interface, and thus fooling the 
aggregation heuristic.

there are 2 Parser classes on is an interface and the other one is a class.
If we would agreggate we would have to show a combined interface/class icon.
This is confusing and the current behaviour is intentional (we had PRs against 
the other one)

Ok to close?

No. I understand the distinction in between Class and Interface, but I should 
not have twice a Class entry with the same name, and in my workspace, I have:

"Parser"

[C] Parser
      +- javax.swing.text.html.parser
[I] Parser
      +- org.xml.sax
[C] Parser
      +- org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.parser
      +- org.eclipse.webdav.internal.authentication
      +- org.mozilla.javascript
...

Workspace is available upon request.
fixed in 20011120

The problem was due to the lack of comparability of images. The comparator
could test for equality, but could not assign an order.

The clean fix would be to have the user of the FilterList to define the order 
of the images. For now, an arbitrary order is chosen.




Three entries for 'Parser' in all types list
