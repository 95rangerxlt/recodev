you can put a $ into a template by prefixing it with another $, i.e., $$.

To make this quoting more obvious we should add a $ -> $$ completion to the 
code assist in the template definition.
But a typetemplate like this:

/**
 * @version  $$Id$$
 * @author  Johan Compagner
 */

still outputs the exact same thing as i typed above so with double $$ 

Oops you're right, in the case of type comments, the template is not evaluated 
correctly.
