TemplateSet - i would like to use it.
would it be possible to provide interface like (or sth similar)?
(stream management should be done within TemplateSet)

TemplateSet ts= new TemplateSet();
ts.read(file); //file is instanceof IFile
Template[] temps= ts.getTemplates();

does not have to be exactly this - something similar will do.
what i want to be able to do is:
- read templates from a file
- parse template(s) from a given String object
- substitute keys (the ${xxx} things) for some real values (and support to 
substitute them all properly)
- write templates to a file

ask me if you need more info

need more info on this. What are you trying to achieve
Adam is trying to use templates for generating classes like <MyPackage>Messages 
for NLS.

For reading templates, you can do:

TemplateSet set= new TemplateSet();
set.addFromFile(new File("templates.xml"));
Template[] templates= set.getTemplates();

For interpolating templates, you have to use the TemplateInterpolator parser
and implement a TemplateEvaluator which is fed by the parser.



template: would like to have API to use templates easily
