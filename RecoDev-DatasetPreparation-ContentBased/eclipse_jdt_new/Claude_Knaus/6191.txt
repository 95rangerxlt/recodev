In a previous version of Eclipse, and in VAJ, and in VAME, I could double-click 
inside a Java string and select the whole string. This is handy for replacing 
the text in the string. For example, if you have a string
"This is a pretty long string and it is incorrect"
then you could double-click in between the first " and the T
or after the last t and before the end "
and the whole string would be selected.
Currently, double-click only selects between brackets. It should select 
between "s as well. Try it in VAJ or VAME to see what I mean.

The double click behaviour in text was changed due to NL reasons. We are now 
leveraging the java.util.text support to determine word boundaries. 

The double click on a quote is a useful feature but if it impacts NL support 
then we should NOT do it. We don't want to define locale specific double click 
policies in the editor. 

Having said that, I wonder whether we can handle a double click on quote 
specially without impacting NL support. Since we always select the entire 
string this should be doable.

Strings are now in there own partition using the default double click strategy, 
i.e. a java.text.Collator based implementation. There should be a string 
specific double click strategy that implements the described behavior. It 
should be consistent with the double click behavior for brackets.
