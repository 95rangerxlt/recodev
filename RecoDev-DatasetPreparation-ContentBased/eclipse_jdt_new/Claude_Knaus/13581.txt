Build 20020321

When you open a .class file which doesn't have source associated with it, you 
get an empty editor.  If you want to see source you must:

- switch to the Packages view
- find the .class file (if you don't have the Link Packages view to current 
selection option turned on)
- find the enclosing JAR file
- change the JAR's properties to attach source to it
- open the .class file again (see Bug 13579)

It would be nice if there were a button, or a hyper-link in the (otherwise 
empty) .class file editor which would let you associate source with the JAR.  
There's nothing displayed in the editor, anyway, so why not use the real-
estate for something useful?

*** Bug 10388 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
partially fixed >= 20020509.
The attach source button is disabled until 15423 is fixed.
*** Bug 13889 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
fixed >= 20020414-N

Note that it still depends on 14113. After changing the source attachment,
the editor of the class file shuts down. This won't happen when 14113 is fixed.



Too many steps to attach source to a JAR
