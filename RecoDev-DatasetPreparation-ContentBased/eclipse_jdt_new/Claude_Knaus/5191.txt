From an Eclipse Corner post with the subject "Editor functionality":

  1. After closing the Find dialog box, there's no Find Next option.

One of our developers answered:

  > 1. I don't understand where exactly you are looking for Find Next.  In the
  > Find/Replace (Ctrl + F) dialog there is a Find Next button.

And another customer answered:

  That is not what you want.
  Then a Dialog is in the way and you must press there with the mouse or
  have focus on the buttont to do it with keyboard but you want always
  to have the focus on the text.

  Very simple solution: F3 jumps from the next to the next.

I think it is a really good idea. Examples of applications that have a "Find 
Next" (or "Search Again") accelerator:
- Lotus Notes (ctrl+G)
- Outlook Express (F3)
- Notepad (F3)
- Wordpad (F3)

The keyboard shortcuts are Ctrl-K (next) and Ctrl-Shift-K (previous).
They work if the find dialog is open, too - provided that the editor has the 
focus.
