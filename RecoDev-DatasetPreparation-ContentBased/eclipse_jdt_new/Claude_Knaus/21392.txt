<ctrl-space> is used for mode switch in Asian language. So in 
Chinese/Japanese/Korean OS, application will never receive <ctrl-space> key, 
<ctrl-space> "the key combination" will never work.

This actually documented in your
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-ui-
home/accessibility/tips.html

I would suggest add an alternate shortcut <ctrl-~> for "content assist" 
besides <ctrl-space>. That will make our life much easier.

I know eclipse has some mechanism for user to add shortcut for some actions.
(by editting some config file in the .metadata directory)

But "content assist" is one of the most frequently used command, add 
some "defaults" will be much better than letting every Chinese/Korean/Japanese 
user to do that by themselves.

There already are equivalents, which are active in the zh_CN locale:
ALT+/ for content assist and Alt+? for parameter info.

Which locales do you use?  Should we add these alternatives for other locales?
See the plugin.xml for org.eclipse.jdt.ui to see how these are done.  Search 
for content.assist.

We should also update the keybindings table to show these alternatives and the 
locales they work in (on both the team web page and in the doc).

Keybinding table fixed and released in both places
Steve replies:

My locale is zh_TW (Chinese - Taiwan)
zh_CN is (Chinese - China)

Currently in Taiwan is Traditional Chinese, and in mainland China
is Simplified Chinese. They are very different in shape and in native
encoding.

FYI, I believe you need to add the shortcut for

ja (Japanese)
ko (Korean)
zh (Chinese - either Simplified or Traditional)

I thought Ctrl+Space was only a conflict in Simplified Chinese.
Is that not the case?

Japanese and Korean fo not use the same mode switching as Chinese (please 
correct me if there is a configuration where it does). The Japanese keyboard 
has a mode switching key and our Korean NT install worked fine with the 
existing bindings.

We should add the one for Traditional Chinese if this is an issue. Moving to 
JDT so that an entry for zh_TW is added.
