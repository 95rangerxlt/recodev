Back in September, I started bug 476610, where I was given a link to allow eclipse to work with java 1.9 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=476610) (http://build.eclipse.org/eclipse/builds/4P/siteDir/updates/4.6-P-builds/P20150901-1406/). Since then, however, the P20150901-1406 subdirectory has been deleted and there are only two jar files at the 4.6-P-builds subdirectory. I am unable to make eclipse install those jar files or the directories containing them. Has the method for java 1.9 patch installation changed or am I doing something wrong with eclipse?

The two jars you are seeing are only meta data of that supposed update site, saying we should get real content from sub directories 
- P20150911-1511
- P20150911-1624
- P20150913-0128

Since those directories no longer exist, there's nothing installable here.

Cc-ing David, assuming he's the one who manages that update site.
The "build.eclipse.org" location is always temporary. 

You can use the persistent repo location at 
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6-P-builds/

Not sure what was in P20150901-1406 but you should use the latest version of what is at that 4.6-P-builds site, which is P20151013-1208. 

In the future, if ever in doubt, you can always check the wiki, at 
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Java9

I'll mark as "fixed", though no code was changed, just information given.
It works, thanks.

Perfect, thanks.

(I shoulda checked the wiki myself ...)


Java 1.9 patch apparently deleted from build.eclipse.org
