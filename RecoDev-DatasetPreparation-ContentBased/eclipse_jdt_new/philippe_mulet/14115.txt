Build 20020416

Changing the source attachement of a jar fires a F_REMOVED_FROM_CLASSPATH delta.
Fixed by firing:
- a F_SOURCEATTACHED delta if a source is attached and no previous source 
existed
- a F_SOURCEDETACHED delta if a source existed and it is removed
- a F_SOURCEATTACHED  | F_SOURCEDETACHED delta if a source is attached and a 
different source existed before.


Changing source attachment should not fire a F_REMOVED_FROM_CLASSPATH delta
