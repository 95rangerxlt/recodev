Please consider adding notes (#) to the property files so translators will know 
the context of a given message.  The subject is not specified, and substitution 
parameters are not evident.

I have clarified, to the best of my limited ability <g>, the messages below.  
Please let me know if I have incorrectly interpreted the subject/parameters.

BTW, where are these messages referenced?  I traced them down to 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.problem.ProblemIrritants, but found no 
references to them or the hardcoded constants.  That might help me more 
accurately clarify messages.

------------------------------------------------

108 = Must return a result of type {0} 
# The subject is a method, i.e., "Method must return a result of type 'x'

159 = Must provide either dimension expressions or an array initializer 
# "Variable (or field) must provide either dimension expressions...

400 = Must implement the inherited abstract method {0} 
# "Class must implement the inherited abstract method 'x'

441 = Must implement the inherited abstract method {1}, but cannot override
it since it is not visible from {0}
# "This class must implement the inherited abstract method 'x', but cannot 
override since it is not visible from 'this class'

412 = Overrides deprecated method from {0}
# "This class overrides deprecated method from 'this superclass'

These messages are indeed referenced indirectly through 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.problem.ProblemIrritants constants.

I can find references to them.

Changed the suggested messages to better indicate the subject.
