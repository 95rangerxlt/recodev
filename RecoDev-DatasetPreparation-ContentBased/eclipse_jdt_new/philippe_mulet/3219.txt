The new markers of the java model define an attribute 'cycle_detected' which every marker in the plugin will have
	(it used to be defined per instance only).

	Instead we should use a common attribute with the compiler (e.g. problemID). When a cycle is detected, we would
	use a special value for this attribute.

NOTES:
Time permitting
Cycle detection got disabled when markers for these became transient.
Changing the implementation so as to couple these marker detection to the other 
classpath ones.
Fixed.
