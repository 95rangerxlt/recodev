Build 20020328

If an anonymous binary type is closed and it is part of a hierarchy, computing 
this hierarchy fails to include it.

This is because the IndexBasedHierarchyBuilder doesn't create a valid 
HierarchyBinaryType: it is created with a '0' enclosing type name.

Fixed by computing the enclosing type name from the resource path.
