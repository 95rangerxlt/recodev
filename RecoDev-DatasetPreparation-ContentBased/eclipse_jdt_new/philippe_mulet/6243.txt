ISourceReference is not an IJavaElement and has no exists() method
however, its 2 methods throw JavaModelException and according to the java doc
it's thrown when the element does not exist.

how then, am i to check that the element does not exist and avoid the exception?
well, all ISourceReference known to man are actually IJavaElements 
but hardcast is a nasty thing and i'd like to avoid it here.

suggestion: can an exists() method be added to ISourceReference 
or ISourceReference be made a subtype of IJavaElement?
i need a clean way to prevent the exception - rather than having to deal with 
it.
