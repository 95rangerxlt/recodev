What behavior do you need exactly ?
(sorry it took so long to answer)

there's no token for EOL, so it's not easy to figure out which line i'm in 
without access to that field


i mean, i could do it with getLineEnds and getCurrentTokenStartPosition 
but it would be suboptimal i think
What if instead you had: IScanner.getLineNumber(int charPosition) ?
would do, i think
Fixed


api: IScanner - Scanner.linePtr
