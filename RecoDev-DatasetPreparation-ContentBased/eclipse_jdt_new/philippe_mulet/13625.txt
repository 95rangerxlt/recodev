There are still some deprecated methods in the AST/DOM.

These should all be deleted asap.
It should not be removed if this breaks the JUI code.
The deprecated methods are:

ASTNode
	public boolean subtreeEquals(ASTNode 
other)

ClassInstanceCreation
	public boolean 
isAnonymousClassDeclaration();
	public void setAnonymousClassDeclaration(boolean 
hasBody)
	public List bodyDeclarations()

They will be removed for the next build. Please 
ensure you are NOT using them anymore.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
