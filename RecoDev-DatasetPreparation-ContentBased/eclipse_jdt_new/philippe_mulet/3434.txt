	I had a corrupt swt project in my workspace. 
	I've deleted it and added it again from the repository.
	When I built I had tons of errors since deleting the
	project from the workspace removed it from all the
	build paths! This is highly surprising and undesirable.
	This behaviour is too smart and shouldn't happen
	for free. A project on the build path is only
	a project reference. 

NOTES:

	I think we do the same for internal jars.

PM (10/4/2001 12:03:46 PM)
	Doing less is feasible, we also adjust on folder renames. 
	Should we lose only project smartness ?

EG (04.10.2001 14:16:21)
	we should loose smartness of both rename and delete
	of projects. The UI can show a broken project
	reference. 
	Smartness at the folder level is what the user wants, but
	I still think we should not do it automatically. It should be
	a value add provided by the UI. For example, the rename
	refactoring had automatic reference update built in and
	we got complaints that users want to turn it off.

We can disable the entire smartness, leaving it to the UI to figure appropriate 
actions. Are you willing to take the responsibility for this ?

If so, we should synchronize the effort, so that it does not break any build.
Smart behavior removed. UI will have to provide actions to assist users like
when renaming the main type in a compilation unit.


Deleting a project from the ws removes it from the buildpath! (1GKZNBS)
