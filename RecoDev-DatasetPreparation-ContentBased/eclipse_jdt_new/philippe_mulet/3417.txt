14/tests/lang/BINC/binc058/binc05802/binc05802.html - POSITIVE TEST
	This is a binary compatibility test. You need to compile the test cases 
in the same order I put them below one by one. And then execute it. The problem 
with the Eclipse
	compiler occurs only at runtime.

Test cases:

	javac 1.4:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: passed with java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError

	javac 1.3:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

	Eclipse compiler:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

NOTES:

	OT (19/09/2001 12:50:45 PM)
		Same explanation than 1GK7VXD: ITPJCORE:WIN2000 - JCK 1.4 - the 
new method is less accessible than the old one.
		The bytecode used is a getfield. But with the changes the 
method is static. Then javac refers to 
javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc058.binc05802.binc05802c and find the
		intermediate static method. The bytecode should be invokestatic 
for a static method. This is why the error is an IncompatibleClassChangeError.

Adapted to this change for 1.4 mode only.
Fixed


JCK 1.4 - BINC - the new method is a static (respectively instance) method. (1GK7WCP)
