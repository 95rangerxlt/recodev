I stumbled across this bug in eclipse-SDK-20011107-win32 compiling an existing 
java project and I worked it down to this test case:

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello");
    }
    
    public void testcase() {
        boolean a = false;
        boolean b = false;

        if (!(a && b)) {}
    }
}

With Sun's java compiler the program outputs:
hello

Although Eclipse will compile this when you run it you get:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: (class: Test, method: testcase
 signature: ()V) Inconsistent stack height 0 != 1

I would consider this a serious bug as code compiled with Eclipse could give 
this error after it has been deployed.

Seems like a bug in boolean optimization.
Bug isolated. When optimizing the ! operator code gen, we forgot to place the 
falseLabel (leaving it to its current value).

Note that our codegen is slightly more compact than javac 1.4.

This was an excellent find, thanks.

Fixed (for next tuesday integration build)
