	to finish the RenameMethod refactoring we need a way to find declarations of methods in anonymous inner types
	
	(we use IType.newTypeHierarchy to find all methods (with the same name and the number of parameters) declared in this hierarchy
	but method from anonymous inner types are not there).


NOTES:
	JW (6/4/01 3:45:09 PM) not for 0.9

	DA (6/20/01 11:51:56 AM)
		This is not made in build 0.125.
