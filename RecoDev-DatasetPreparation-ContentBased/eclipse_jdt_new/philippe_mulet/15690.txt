build 20020508

1) I have an old workspace (it is small and available upon request).
2) Set -data to point to this workspace
3) Eclipse starts and I select all projects and do a refresh
4) No problem shows up in the UI but there is an exception being printed to 
the console (-consolelog)
5) Will attach the log

The problem seems to be trying to update the classpath in the wrong workspace 
notification lifecycle.

Created attachment 784

Problem is that variable initializer is running during post_change 
notification, and thus causing some grief.

Changed the implementation so as to avoid attempting to rewrite the .classpath 
file if in the middle of provessing a post-change event.

Fixed.


Classpath being set in wrong notification lifecycle
