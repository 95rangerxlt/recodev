public class Alpha {
	static class Beta<T> {
		T obj;
	}
}

This simple case gives error in cheetah 0.5:
"Cannot make a static reference to the type parameter T"
It compiles fine with javac from 1.5.0b1.
Error occurs only for static inner classes - non-static ones seem to be ok.

Reproduced. Regression test added: GenericTypeTest#test205.

Problem was that insideStaticContext flag was positionned too early for 
ClassScope, when it should only be positionned after the type variable lookup 
(Scope#getTypeOrPackage(char[], int)).

Fixed.
