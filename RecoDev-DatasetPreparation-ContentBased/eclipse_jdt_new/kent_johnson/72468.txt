I got the above message in Eclipse, and the only way I could make it go away was
to modify the source (insert a space) and then save it, thus forcing
recompilation.  To reproduce the problem, create the following files:

A.java:
interface A {
}

B.java:
interface B extends A {
}

C.java:
class C implements B {
}

Now delete A.java, and fix the compilation error in B.java by removing "extends
A". C should be OK now (if it was recompiled), but you get the above error
message instead.

The same error message has been reported in #35899, allegedly fixed.

bug 35899 is unrelated. This problem is much simpler.

The problem class file generated for B is the same as the 'new' class file for 
B after the missing type reference is removed.

We need to do more than compare the class files to see if B is structurally 
changed. Can occur with either an invalid superclass or superinterface 
reference.

Could add another marker to track types with invalid supertypes. Then we could 
detect any change to one of these types and recompile dependents.
Changed problem types so they will be structurally different when the 
offending supertype reference is removed.

Fix will appear in 3.1 M2 & 3.0.1

Added 2 tests to DependencyTests
Verified for 3.0.1 RC1
Some how the bug is still reproducable in Eclipse 3.0.1.
Just compile 'jaxme.0.3.1' code, following message is produced.

The hierarchy of the type AnyAttributePropertySG is inconsistent
>> AnyAttributePropertySG is a jaxme class.

such an error does exist with a xerces2.6.2 project also.

its very annoying. please resolve.
Jagsir: We need you to attach a testcase that shows the problem.
No response.

Jagsir: Please open a new bug report with your complete testcase.
