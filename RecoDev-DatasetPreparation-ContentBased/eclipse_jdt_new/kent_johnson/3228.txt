Create one project 'Compiler' with all batch compiler sources. Discard 'rt.jar' from its build path, this will trigger a rebuild which will take
an extremely long time to complete.

It seems it is recompiling the same files over and over again (still making progress but way too slow).

NOTES:

PM (3/19/2001 1:17:32 PM)
	Adding the jar back to the classpath properly recompiled the workspace content and fixed all problems.

PM (3/19/2001 1:22:22 PM)
	Same behavior with the tech-preview.

Closed - not reproducable with new builder.

The new builder rebuilds the entire project when the classpath is changed.


Discarding rt.jar from build path triggers too many recompilation (1GAU1J0)
