	autobuild on
	1. Create project Test1, import startup.jar (from the eclipse root folder)
	2. create project Test2, add the jar Test1/startup.jar to its class path
	3. create a type A that extends UIMain.java (contained in startup.jar)
	4. release the two project to CVS
	5. remove the projects from the workspace
	6. in the repository view, add Test2 to your workspace: Compiling errors as startup.jar is not found
	7. now add Test1 to your workspace: The errors are still there after the auto build. Build does not help, Rebuild All is needed

NOTES:
EG (6/5/2001 5:51:57 AM)
	This problem is known for some time so I assume fix
	isn't straightforward. Defer would be OK by me.
	The real solution is support for loading required projects.
