When creating a new project from  sources in a pre-existing source folder, I
have seen the package names prefix-truncated: the first one or more letters are
removed.
For instance, compling the JTidy package gives a message like:
compiling idy...
Compiling my own packages removes the first few qualifications
(edu.gatech.disl.djb.log becomes disl.djb.log)

Which build was this ? Do you notice this in all progress dialogs or just the 
one during compilation ?
This was with build 
20011206 stable
(win2k, jdk1.3.1_01)

I only noticed this in the compilation dialog, but I didn't look at many others
I did not see this problem in refresh from local (on my home machine -- Win98)
It seems to only crop up when creating a new project and pointing the source
folder to a pre-existing project (Something I do fairly frequently since I have
set up eclipse on several machines, and I have been trying to follow the stable
builds)

Was the project external to the workspace?

If so then this problem was fixed a few days ago.
Yes, all of my projects are external to the workspace.  Keeping the projects
under the workspace is limiting; it seems especially bad for running eclipse
over a network drive (if the network is not running at optimal efficiency,
eclipse really really slows down when the metadata is not local)
Closed, fixed last Friday, Dec. 7th.
