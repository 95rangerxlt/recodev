When building a project containing the Eclipse UI plugin, the progress message often gets split into two lines, 
then goes back to one line.  It's more flashy than you would like.
The message could be shortened from, e.g. "Building: Compiling contents of Eclipse UI Standard Components/org/eclipse/ui/views/navigator"
to something like: "Compiling org.eclipse.ui.views.navigator".
From a Java perspective, the package names are more interesting than the folder names.
So parent folders need not be included, and it should use '.' instead of '/'.

	Agreed, but the build progress should then be more indicative about the project being processed, so that we can show progress with relative path info.

The message is now shorter but still includes the Project & source folder.
Can you remove the 'Building:' prefix which only occurs when a project is 
explicitly told to build ("Rebuild project" from pop-up menu).

Full builds & normal incremental builds do not have a prefix.
That prefix is added by the UI operation that invokes the build (BuildAction).  
I believe you can manipulate this using IProgressMonitor.setTaskName().  I've 
found the following to work well:

String mainTaskLabel = ...;
monitor.beginTask(mainTaskLabel, work);
monitor.setTaskName(mainTaskLabel);

This replaces the default task name supplied by the outer context (the UI in 
this case).
Normally clients should not have to call setTaskName.
See IProgressMonitor.setTaskName for more details.

I've removed the "Building: " prefix from BuildAction.

The message details everything we need & is no longer "flashy".
