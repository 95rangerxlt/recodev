Open a Java compare editor for an incoming change. Ctrl+, and Ctrl+. should jump through the differences.

In the left editor, Ctrl+, initially works fine. However, Ctrl+. does not move the caret but opens the content assist popup (probably because . is an auto-activation character).

In the right editor, both shortcuts don't work. And when you set the focus back to the left editor, Ctrl+, also dosn't work there any more.

Tomasz, can you please take a look.
Would be good to have a fix for M5.
I installed an IExecutionListener and the info I got from it showed me that both commands have no handlers during the execution attempt.
ping. ;-)

Patch v01

Dani, you probably won't belive it but I was looking at this issue yesterday ;) 

When switching between viewers calling setActionsActivated implementation from JMV tends to disconnect[2] "Next", "Previous" and other actions from CompareEditorContributor[3]. The fix reconnects them, so the actions are properly handled.

[1] org.eclipse.compare.contentmergeviewer.TextMergeViewer.setActionsActivated(SourceViewer, boolean)
[2] org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.AbstractTextEditor.setActionActivation(boolean) line: 5123
[3] org.eclipse.compare.internal.CompareEditorContributor.setActiveEditor(IEditorPart): line 111

btw, the shortcuts don't work in dialogs but they are supposed to do so.

Patch v02

Improved version of "Patch v01", the refresh takes place only when *activating* a viewer which is *editor backed*. 

Firstly, when disconnecting actions / disactivating a viewer, the active editor in CompareEditorContributor is already set or should be set to null, the refresh would set the Compare Editor as the active one, which is wrong. Secondly, when a viewer is not editor backed, the situation described in this bug doesn't occur, so there is no need to refresh the contributor.
The latest patch has been released to HEAD of org.eclipse.compare, available in builds >I20090309-0800.


[compare] Java compare editor: Ctrl+. opens content assist
