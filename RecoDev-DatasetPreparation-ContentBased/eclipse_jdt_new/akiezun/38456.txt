I wasn't able to find a difference between pressing No and Cancel. So we 
should remove one.
The icon used to render a compilation unit is the one for *.java files outside 
of the build path even if I select a *.java file that is on the build path.
The path of the elements should be appened to the elements name if 
a "container" gets deleted. 
User should be able to check/uncheck read-only elements to be deleted. Check 
box is only necessary if more than one read-only element gets deleted.
Regarding Cancel and No. Should cancel close both dialogs. This wouldn't be a 
standard UI interaction.
checkboxes would be an overkill, imo
fixed - agreed to show what we did in 2.0 (only info that there're some
read-only elements)
