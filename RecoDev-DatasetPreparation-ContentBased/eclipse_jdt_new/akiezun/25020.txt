Build 20020918

The Refactoring dialog has the following accessibility problems

1) Access Modifier should be a group box in order that screen readers read it
2) Missing mnemonics for add and remove button, return type and access 
modifier entries
3) Method signature preview cannot get focus and hence is not read by scree 
readers

Also similar issues with the Rename method dialog - missing mnemonics on all 
widgets including Back, Next and Finish buttons
Pull up dialog as well.
back, next and finish are platform buttons
1) fixed
2) fixed
rename method - cannot reproduce - i see all mnemonics
pull up - cannot reproduce - i see all mnemonics

3) we have tons of labels like that. does the workbench.ui really turn them all 
to Text widgets?
It does if the information is essential to the use of the dialog - for 
instance we do for the info property page but don't for notes in preference 
pages.

I think you could decide either way with this one as the information exists 
elsewhere in the dialog so it is not essential. Just wanted to bring it to 
your attention.
all right, thanks
closing this one as fixed - the preview is just additional info that can be
inferred from other elements

reopen if you disagree
