Discovered at the same time as bug 24571

I tried the "move to top level" refactoring on a static inner class.
The class constructors were migrated correctly to the new top level class.
The constructor calls however had gained an extra "this" parameter.
1) There is a compile error becuse the constructors don't match up
2) There is no need to pass an explicit reference to the original enclosing
class when moving a static inner class.

Will attach the before and after classes. This also demonstrates the problem
in bug 24571

Created attachment 2131
before with inner class
Created attachment 2132
inner class now as top level
Created attachment 2133
new outer class with incorrect constructor call
cool - thank for the test case
will fix
fixed


Move To Top Level:  incorrect this in constructor calls



fix for 24576
