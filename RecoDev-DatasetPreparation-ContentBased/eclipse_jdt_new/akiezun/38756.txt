Running the refactoring tests with Sun 1.3.1_08 sometimes has errors (e.g.
MultiMoveTests.test2 had an error.) and sometimes  succeeds. There seems to be a
timing and/or locking problem in JDT Core and/or UI.

This should be investigated since with this behavior with every build test we
take the risk to fail which causes additional work load every time.

Adam, please take the time to nail this down. We have to get rid of the 
sporadic test failures.
this has not happened for a long time. i suspect that our creating a mock 
clipboard fixed it.


Sporadic errors when running refactoring tests
