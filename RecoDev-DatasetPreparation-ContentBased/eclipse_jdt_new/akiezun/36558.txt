1. the dialog should use an error message if i enter a non-number or a number 
out of range (subclassing StatusDialog should help)

right now, a scary error dialog pops up - which is suboptimal

2. mnemonics are mising

3. wording of name pattern should explain clearly what is going to be shown, 
what filtered (see package explorer filters dialog)

I'll fix the issues you mention. (So you don't like my error dialog? The code
acts exactly as the Tasks filter dialog. I know that's not JDT, but still... :-) )
then Task list is bogus :)
error dialogs like that are too scary and should be reserved for internal 
errors or really grave problems

in this case, a status like would be much better

Fix for scary error dialog :-)

Patch for JDT UI project.

This patch contains fixes for the scary error dialog - I like that phrase :-),
mnemonics and wordings.

The dialog has been changed into a StatusDialog, the wordings have been copied
from the package explorer's filter dialog and mnemonics have been added to the
captions.
very good, thanks

more ui tweaks would be appreciated:
- when the checkbox is cleared, then the label under the text field should be 
disabled
- the threshold text field should be on the right side of its label, not under 
it
