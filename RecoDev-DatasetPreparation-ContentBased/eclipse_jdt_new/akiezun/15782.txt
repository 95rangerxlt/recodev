(Pull up is really nice!).

The first page of the pull up method wizard description says:

Select the methods to be deleted

That label scares me every time I use the pull up feature because I
(irrationally) think its going to delete the methods not pull them up. Could we
change it to be the following?

Select the methods to be pulled up
the description is not optimial. but the new suggested wording isn't precise. 
The method to be pulled up is already selected by the user. On the page you 
select the methods to be deleted in subclasses after the pull-up. 

suggest the following tweaks to make this more clear:
*     change the description to: "Select the members to be 
      removed in subtypes after pull up."

*     move the the status message about how many    
      methods are selected to be deleted below the 
      checkbox tree. 
      This is were we usually show this status.

*     change the title of the checkbox tree 
      from "Type hierarchy"  to "Subtypes of: TYPENAME"
      Where TYPENAME is the target type of the pull up.
      This makes the purpose more clear and results
      in both panes having a consistent title.

status information in wizards is presented at the top - i followed the same
