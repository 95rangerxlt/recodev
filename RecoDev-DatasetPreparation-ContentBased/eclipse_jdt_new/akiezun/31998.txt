because it looks like  bug 31456
will remain unfixed
we will have to disable renaming of:
- linked package
- linked cus
- main types in linked cus
we might have to disable other stuff too
maybe everything that possibly calls any of:

ISourceManipulation:copy
ISourceManipulation:move
ISourceManipulation:rename 
ISourceManipulation:delete

on anything that can be linked
Adam, please check with Java/Core which actions we have to disable. 

I would prefer a solution where the action is still enabled but a dialog pops 
up telling the user that the action isn't available on linked resources. 
Otherwise it will be hard for users to find out why the action is disabled.
done so far:
- ICompilationUnit
   - delete - no action necessary, because IResource delete is ok
   - rename, move, copy - using resource code if cu is linked

- IPackageFragment
   - delete - big dialog saying package will be unlinked and subpackages gone 
from workspace (only unlinks stuff)
   - rename, move, copy - disabled 

still need to have a look at 
IPackageFragmentRoots in the case of nested source folders with the top one 
being linked
nope, jcore throws JME on all linked folders
need to disable:
 - copy, move of linked source folders

need to decide what to do with:
- rename (can either disable or revert to my own code that worked just fine)
- delete (can either disable or revert to my own code that worked just fine)


for  delete i will use my old code
rename is disabled on linked source folders
disabling delete would be too brutal - using our old code in the case where 
source folder is linked

this works, except for 1 case: linked source folder has a nested source folder
them both are unlinked but the nested one is not removed from the classpath
(all nested source folders of a source folder are always unlinked)

worked-around, not fixed
jcore will fix after 2.1


we will have to disable renaming of linked packages (and cus)
