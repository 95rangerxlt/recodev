If you try to externalize strings from a class contained in a package whose 
name starts with a cap, you will not be able to complete the externalization 
because of an error on the second page. The error message says : "By 
convention, packages names usually start with a lowercase letter".

This is inconsistent with the behaviour of the new Package Wizard which only 
gives a warning for package name starting with a cap.
