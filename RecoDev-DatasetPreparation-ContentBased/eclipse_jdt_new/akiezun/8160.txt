The dialog for 'Find Strings to Externalize...' has a table widget which can 
grow (horizontally) out of the dialog bounds. Either this is an SWT layout 
problem or wrong usage of the layouts.

The dialog should a reasonble fixed default size and not grow out of bounds.
addressed table height problem 
fixing the dialog size is not the correct thing to do imo (screen resolutions 
chnage)

could not reproduce the table width problem - please give an example of a cu
on which it grows too large
reopen - it's only on linux
can you try it now?
works for me!
fixed then
