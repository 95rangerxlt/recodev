Jesper, any progress here?
I haven't had much time to look at it recently. I hope to fix it/locate the
error tonight (Danish time).

Fix for test failure (hopefully)

Patch against CallHierarchyTest.java.

This patch hopefully fixes the failure in the test case. I have been unable to
reproduce the error locally, but I believe that I have found the problem (I was
relying too much on the order of search results).
ok, released
