Steps:

Setup:
1) in junit.awtui.Logo create a bogus super class that extends Canvas (call it 
XCanvas). 
2) Extract the line: URL url= BaseTestRunner.class.getResource(nameOfStrings);
from method loadImage into its own method called getURL.
3)Choose to refactor->Pull Up

Notice that in the preview dialog the 'source of type' and 'subtype of type' 
boxes have only one line [or tree node] visible making very difficult to 
understand what the refactoring. They should be larger so I can gleen what is 
going on.

Adam, please assign a default width and height hint to the viewers, so that the 
page comes up in a reasonable size.
this isn't a P1!
not an enhancement either
not a problem anymore


UI for refactoring 'pull up...' must be [a bit] larger [refactoring]
