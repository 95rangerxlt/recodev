When a table cell (in the editable table of parameters) enters the editing 
state (i.e. when a caret appears in the cell), and then exits the editing

parameters were modified, reordered or added, the visibility and return type 
are unchanged."

(A user can make a cell enter the editing state by double clicking on it, or 
selecting it immediately after some other cell was selected)
