- Close all programs(important)
- Create an empty resource project
- Select any file and drop it into a folder in the project
- Bring the Windows explorer to front so that it covers the middle of the 
screen, but that the folder in the project remains visible. Make sure there is 
only *one* Windows explorer window running(important).
- Drag and drop the same file to the same place
- The Windows explorer window now appears to be frozen. *Behind* the Windows 
explorer there is a modal requester asking whether the file should be replaced. 
Click in the Eclipse window, close requester, and Windows explorer now works 
again.

No exceptions in log.

Knut, can you look into this (not 2.1 critical). I tried reproducing it on Win 
2000 and was not successful...but then again I had other programs running but 
only one Explorer window.

I get the modal dialog, but it comes to the front. If I go to the explorer 
window before closing the prompter, the explorer is not frozen.

It does not readily(?) happen if you more than Eclipse + Internet Explorer open.

To specific, you should use Internet Explorer, not Windows explorer to browse 
some directory.

Please clarify the steps required to reproduce this. 
You write that you use IE to browse the file system. Do you select File/Open in 
Internet Explorer and then drag a file to the Eclipse workspace so that it 
overwrites an existing file?
Do you drag into the Navigator or Package Explorer?
Which Eclipse build are you using?
>Please clarify the steps required to reproduce this. 

1. IMPORTANT! close *all* programs
2. start eclipse
3. create empty project "foo"
4. Open IE 
5. navigate to c:\temp (or anywhere you have some files)
6. drag and drop any file into "foo". Works ok.
7. drag and drop the same file into "foo". Eclipse shows requester asking if 
the file should be replaced. Notice that IE is unresponsive until Eclipse 
requester has been closed.

>Which Eclipse build are you using?

Happens with 2.1 release version.

I think I followed exactly your steps and I still can't reproduce this. Which 
version of IE are you using? What happens if you drag a file from IE into some 
other application that also brings up a prompt when you drop? E.g., drop a non-
image file in Paint. Does that lock up IE as well?
>I think I followed exactly your steps and I still can't reproduce this. 
>Which version of IE are you using? 

6.0

This happens @ home and at work. 2000 and XP respectively.

You don't even need to use IE/Explorer.

Just drag any icon from your desktop to an Eclipse project. The second 
time, Eclipse puts up the modal requester and the desktop 
is locked.

No.

When I drag and drop a folde onto paint, I get a modal requester in Paint, but 
IE/the desktop does not lock up.

I can reproduce this problem when dropping in the Package Explorer. You don't 
see this when dropping a file in the Navigator, do you?

No.

It appears only Package Explorer exhibts the problem.

Adam, may be this has something to do with the parent we use for the requester 
poping up. 
this is an equivalent of bug 16478 in JDT
fix is the same
