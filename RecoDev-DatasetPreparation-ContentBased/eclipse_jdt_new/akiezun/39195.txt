Eclipse 2.1 Release

If you move/copy/delete a variable that s defined together with more variables 
in one line, the other variable are also modified. Eg:

private int var11, var2, var3;

If you select all 3 vars in the outline view and cut/copy and paste it into 
another compilation unit, this line will exist 3 times.

---

If you have an error in you compilation unit because of a duplicated filed and 
you select on field in the oultine view and delete it, the wrong one is deleted.

eg:

private Set var;
[...]
private HashSet var;

If you select the "HashSet var" in the outline view and delete it, the "Set 
var" is deleted and not "HashSet var".
