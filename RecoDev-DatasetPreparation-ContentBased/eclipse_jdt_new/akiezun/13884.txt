The key names generated are not matching our conventions. They should be
at least an option to generate key names, which are similar to our conventions
to reduce editing of them.

  - no use of '_' but use capitalization ('fooBar' instead of 'foo_bar')
  - use numbers as postfix only if ambiguous

why should it be optimized for self-hosting?
it's a general tool

pde nls maybe <g>
we're the ones using the most, at least for the moment, aren't we? Why should 
we make it harder for us to use than necessary? It could be an internal 
extension to mangle the keys. Maybe it could be even an extension point which 
takes a string and translates to a key name.
changing the default generated names to a more commonly used pattern makes sense
incorrectly reassigned i think
will do after 2.0
actually, we're thinking about generating just key1, key2 .... 
will generate just key1, key2
fixed
