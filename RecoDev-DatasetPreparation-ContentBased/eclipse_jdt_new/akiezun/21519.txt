He has tryed to delete a jar library from "Package Explorer" but, even if
eclipse deleted it from the tree view, the jar file was already present in
libraries tab of the "Java Build Path" and it has created some problems.

We would like to know how to delete, safely, a JAR library.

Best Regards,

Andrea

Can you provide exact steps to reproduce this defect ? The log you pasted  
doesn't show any information relevant to this issue (unfortunately).
Sorry for my late but I was on hollidy.

The steps of the operation was:

1) Deleting a jar library from "Package Explorer"
2) Modifing the code files and trying to rebuild the project

The project did not rebuild because The "deleted" jar file was yet present in
libraries tab of the "Java Build Path".

When a resource is deleted, we do not update the classpath by removing any 
entry targeting it. We experimented removing, but when doing updates 
(remove/add back) it would result in some classpath settings to be lost.

You can manually go and fix the classpath of the project, or turn off the check 
for building in presence of classpath issues (see 
Window>Preferences>Java>Compiler>Other>Stop building when an invalid classpath 
is detected).

Now, maybe UI could trap the deletion and optionally offer to fix-up the 
classpath for you ? Passing along to JDT/UI as there is no action planned in 
JDT/Core.
When deleting an internal Jar that is referencesd by other projects we should 
show a dialog asking if Eclipse should also update the class path of the 
project referencing the internal Jar. That would give the user a better 
understanding about what is going to happen.
implemented now - you see a dialog saying that other projects reference the JAR
