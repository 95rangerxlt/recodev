If the specified ISourceReference is an IInitializer from a class file,
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.reorg.SourceReferenceAction.isDeletedFromEditor
fails with a NullPointerException. 

This is due to the fact that IMember.isBinary always returns false for
initializers (see comments on Bug #37199 why this is so). Thus, the "non-binary"
initializer has no compilation unit, since it is loaded from a class file.

bizarre - non-binary things that have no cus
fixed by detecting this strange case and saying 'no'
