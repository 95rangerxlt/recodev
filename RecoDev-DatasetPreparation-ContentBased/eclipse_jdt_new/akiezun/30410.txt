Build I20030122

The refactoring doesn't update the variable name and import statements in 
reimplemented methods.

Case

class A {
  public void foo(ICompilationUnit cu) {
  }
}

class B extends A {
  public void foo (ICompilationUnit cu) {
  }
}

- select foo in A and activate change method signature.
- change cu to sr
- change ICompilationUnit to ISourceReference

param names are local to each method - renaming the all would require more 
checking than we currently do (name conflick checking for _each_ method in the 
ripple, not just 1)
if it is to be implemented, then it'd require a feature request anyway :-)

i'll look into the import problem

yup, no imports are added by this refactoring
the problem is that you entered ISourceReference, and it being not a fully 
qualified type name, the import edit will simply fail i think

i don't want to force people to use full type names or add a browse button 
(which would maybe be a solution but you'd need 1 browse button per 'parameter 
type' cell)

unsure how to resolve this
have a fix
test cases added
fixed
