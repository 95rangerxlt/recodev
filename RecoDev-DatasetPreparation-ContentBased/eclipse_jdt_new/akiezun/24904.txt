Build 20021016

1. Open extract method refactoring wizard
See: you can select each table cell individually and it gets colored light blue
2. Now move one param up or down
==> you can no longer single select a cell only whole line and coloring is gone too

I can't reproduce this in 20021018.
Dan, can you give precise steps. (Do you use the mouse or keyboard?)
Problem still exists in 20021023.
You must select code which results in a method with more than one parameter.

Shouldn't this go to Adam?
