Fix for drag & drop

Patch against JDT UI.

This patch adds drag & drop support to the call hierarchy view. It's possible
to select a method in the call hierarchy view by dropping an IMethod instance
on the viewers (or the "empty" state label).

It's also possible to drag methods from the tree viewer to other JDT viewers.
works like a charm, thanks
