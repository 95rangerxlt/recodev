Fix for using working copies

Patch against JDT UI.

Changes the call hierarchy to refrain from using working copies (i.e.
converting to the original element).
released,
i made it use JavaModelUtil.toOriginal rather than having this method again in 
CallHierarchy
(please yell if that's not ok)
No, that's great - any sanity check is greatly appreciated.
