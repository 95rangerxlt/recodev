as it is now the error page always gets the original element from the working 
copy i pass it in the JavaSourceContext

it should be able to just use this working copy - otherwise i have no way to 
present error context correctly

Fixed the part that the error wizard page now uses the working copy passed in 
the source context. It doesn't use the original element anymore.

Moving to AK, since the source context contains the wrong working copy
working copy was actually the correct one - but it was destroyed.
fixed by added a new context class that takes just strings


refactoring error page: must be able to handle working copies
