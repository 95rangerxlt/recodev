Build F2, running latest NL fragments.
I have been unable to confirm this problem in F3, because we have not migrated 
to that build yet for our fragments.

This problem was reported in Portugese Brazilian, but it probably will occur in 
all languages, especially German.  

Here's how to get to the offending buttons.  I will also attach a screenshot 
showing which ones are affected in Brazilian.

Modify Parameters truncated text
it's a general problem:

you must call Button::setText _before_
Button::setLayoutData

in, jdt ui i found a set of classes that have this problem:
JarManifestWizardPage
EditTemplateDialog
RenameInputDialog
PullUpInputPage
 and the culprit for this bug:
ModifyParametersInputPage

one more: in Platform Search
ScopePart
more info: it seems to be broken only if we use SWTUtil to compute button sizes
which leaves only 2 classes to fix:
PullUpInputPage
ModifyParametersInputPage
