Select a method to move, choose 'Move Method'
The dialog that comes up should have the focus on the name text box.

- The text label before the text box is larger than the text box. It should 
kept small. I suggest to have the description label above the text box

- The browse button offers binary types to choose. There is also no validating 
happening on the text box for this.

- The dialog's title should be capitalized.
- The wizard allows to press 'ok' without any name input at all

- press on 'preview', the progress monitor says 'Checking preconditions'
it should have '...' (I think)
i thought you meant 'move method' but now i see you meant 'move static members'
the old title ("Move Method: Dialog has focus not set") was misleading 
fixed
its better to not show the binary types in the dialog instead of bringing an 
error message
-> create a search scope containing only the source package fragment roots.

fixed
