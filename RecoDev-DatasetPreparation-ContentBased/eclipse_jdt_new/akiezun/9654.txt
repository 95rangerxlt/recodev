a. buttons are too small
b. marking between button and list is too large, top button should be aligned 
with dialog top
c. the table should have a label so it can contain a mnemonic
d. when coming up, no table entry is selected. however, both move buttons are 
enabled
e. multiple selection should be allowed, as move up / down can be applied on 
more that one item

something very long, the preview is cur off.
g. It would be nice if the signature preview has the backaground color set to 
the same color as a hover
h. duplicated name validation could be performed on the first page
i. the first and second column could be merged
j. dialog comes up huge for methods with many parameters
