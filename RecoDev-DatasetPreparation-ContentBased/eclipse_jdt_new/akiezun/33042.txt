there seems to be no method in NamingConventions to do this
(i.e. to ask for a suggested field name by giving a local name

so, for example i would ask:
i have this temp called 'previewLabel' of type org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label
what is the suggested field name for it?
and if i had 'f' configured as a field prefix, it'd return 
{"fPreviewLabel", "previewLabel"})

asking jcore if i'm missing something
