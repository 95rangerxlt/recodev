The new Externalize Strings feature can generate Java code which:
1) Does not adhere to the preferences for line length and other code 
formatting parameters
2) Places the //$NON-NLS-<n>$ comment(s) on a new line beneath
the text to which it refers

Although the non-compliance of the generated code in general is a mere 
annoyance, the bad placement of the 'escape' comment in the generate 
code (Messages class) causes a subsequent Externalize Strings pass to 
pick up strings which are intended to be passed over.
