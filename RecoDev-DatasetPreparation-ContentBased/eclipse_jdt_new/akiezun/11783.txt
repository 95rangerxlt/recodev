If there's no text in the clipboard and a java resource in the clipboard,
the menu shows 'Paste' disabled, while the context menu is enabled.
I only observed this on linux, but I suspect it happens for w2k if the
text clipboard was empty.

w2k only:
  Cut is enabled in menu but not in context menu.
need better steps:
what is selected when you look at the cut and paste actions?

'context menu' is not clear - which one?
I meant the context menu of the package view.
are you sure there's no text in the clipboard?
when you 'copy' i put stuff in the text clipboard as well.

can you have a look if the navigator does it correctly?
yes, you're right. there is text in the clipboard.

  1) copy a CU (context menu)
  2) select enclosing package
  3) verify that Paste is enabled in the context menu,
     but not in the main menu

  I can paste in the editor the name of the CU using the main menu.

fixed now


clipboard based copying of java resources - inconsistent menu and context menu
