I created several public static arrays in a class.  I had numerous references to 
these arrays in various classes.  I then decided to refactor these arrays and 
move them to a different class. Unfortunately, any place I had a reference to 
"MyClass.myArray.length", the refactoring removed the ".length", resulting in 
many compile errors.

test created
SearchEngine problem

test case:
public class A {
    public static final int[] a= {1, 2, 3};
    void f(){
        int x= A.a.length;
        A.a.clone();
    }
}

2 references to A.a are reported (correct)
1st is of length 10 (incorrect)
2ns is of length 3 (correct)
nope, i was wrong
fixed


Refactoring: Moving multiple static arrays broke references to array.length [refactoring]
