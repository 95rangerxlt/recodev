If a generated file satisfies a missing type in another file, we should rerun
APT on the file which would be fixed by the new type. Currently java compilation
does the correct thing, but APT does not.

Need to keep track of files with missing types and recompile at the end of the
round if new types are generated. For good perf, need to track the names and
only compile those missing types that were generated.
