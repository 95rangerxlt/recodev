We need to go through the catch blocks in the apt plugins to make sure we are 
doing the correct thing with exceptions.  I suspect we should be logging these 
to someplace other than the console.

We should do this before we ship.

We need to go through the catch blocks in the apt plugins to make sure we are 
doing the correct thing with exceptions.  I suspect we should be logging these 
to someplace other than the console.

We should do this before we ship.

I think we want to do something like the following in catch blocks:

		IStatus status= new Status(
			IStatus.ERROR, 
			<apt-plugin-id>, //JavaCore.PLUGIN_ID, 
			IStatus.ERROR, 
			message, 
			e); 
		JavaCore.getPlugin().getLog().log(status);
AptPlugin.log(Throwable e, String message) does just that.  Feel free to use it.

We need to do something a bit more sophisticated for apt.ui.  (See jdt.ui's 
ExceptionHandler.)

Let's leave this bug open until immediately before we ship, so that we can 
make sure we do a final review of try/catch blocks and nothing slips through.

All core catch blocks have been updated as of today, 7/13/05. Will make another
pass before ship. In addition, at that point need to remove use of stderr in
AptPlugin.log().
All catch blocks are logging to the error log. I've also removed the STDERR messages in 3.2, as they're redundant.


review all catch blocks to be sure we are appropriately logging exceptions
