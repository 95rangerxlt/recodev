Created attachment 127631
Patch with JavaElementImplementationHyperlink.open() showing error dialog and message.
- Why is there a space after "catch (InvocationTargetException e"?
- The title of the error dialog should be the name of the user action.
- The InvocationTargetException is not too interesting. We should log the actual exception inside it.
- typo in ...found_message: *I*mplementations

Released to HEAD with a few fixes. Please have a look at my changes.
