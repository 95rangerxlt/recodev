Actually it is currently not sorted alphabetically but how the working sets appear in the Package Explorer. We should just sort all of them alphabetically since there's no way for the user to change the order in the dialog.

WorkingSetAssignments dialog is now alphabetically sorted.
Thanks for the patch Raksha.
