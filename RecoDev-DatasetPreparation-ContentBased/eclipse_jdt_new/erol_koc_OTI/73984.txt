4) Update the path to jar file in user libraries (select old jar reference,

Regarding step 4:

- select the jar in the user libraries preference page and press the edit
  button and navigate to the new location and press OK in the file dialog.

  Observe: the old one is still used

Workaround: remove the Jar and add it again
