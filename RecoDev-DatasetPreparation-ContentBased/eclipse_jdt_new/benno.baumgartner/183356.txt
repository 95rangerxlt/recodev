HEAD

The messages in the Package Explorer's Working Set dialogs are a bit misleading. E.g. "Check working sets containing the elements:" sounds more like a query for existing state than an invitation to do something. "working sets containing" means "the working sets that already contain", and not "working sets that should contain".

I'll attach a patch with proposed fixes (including a few mnemonic additions).
