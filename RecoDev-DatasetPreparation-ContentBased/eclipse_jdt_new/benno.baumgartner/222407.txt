I20080305-1100 + ZRH plug-ins from 20080311-0914

Open breadcrumb dropdown to show children of a binary package java.util from rt.jar.

The tree includes e.g a top level item 'UnmodifiableCollection'. This is in fact the nested class java.util.Collections.UnmodifiableCollection and should not be shown as top level type.

Similar problem for anonymous types, e.g the last 'new AbstractSet() {...}' is inside java.util.TreeMap.keySet().

The dropdown should filter out member, local, and anonymous types from class files.

Getting the right parent chain for nested binary types is hard. You could try it with IType#getDeclaringType(), but this only works for member types, see bug 87165 and bug 151374.

Agree.
Should look like in Java Browsing perspective.
