Hi,

I just tried the new cleanup wizard. It works as expected for all but one file. This file seems to be nothing special: it compiles normally. However, the attached exception is always thrown when I am pressing next on the Clean Up wizard page. When I'm deactivating the selection "Convert for loops to enhanced", then everything works fine. Seems to be a bug in the for loops refactoring.

Best regards, Ulli

Hi Ulli,

Is it possible for you to attach the file (or project) causing the problem?
Which clean ups are enabled?

Thanks, B
This might be a dup of bug 160218, although the exception thrown is slightly different. Need more information...

Configuration of Cleanup

The cleanups "for loop" and "braces" only create the problem.
I'll send the file per Email, it should not appear on the Bugzilla pages...
Thanks for the file Ulli. I did cut it down to:

Given:
package test1;
public class E1 {
	public void foo(Object[] objs) {
		if (objs != null)
			for (int i = 0; i < objs.length; i++)
				System.out.println(objs[i]);
	}
}
Clean Ups:
- Convert control statement bodies to block
- Convert for loops to enhanced for loops

1. Select E1 and another cu
2. Source>Clean Up
3. The clean up wizard should appear
4. Press 'Next'
Is:
 Exception is thrown
Should:
if (objs != null) {
	for (Object element : objs) {
		System.out.println(element);
	}
}

The exception is thrown in 3.2.1 and HEAD, but not 3.3M2. In neither version is the code transformed correctly. Weird...
