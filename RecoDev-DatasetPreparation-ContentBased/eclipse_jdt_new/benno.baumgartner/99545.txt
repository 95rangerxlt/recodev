In the "New Java Project" wizard project layout options, the labels for the tow
options are:
"Use project folder as root for sources and class files"
and
"Create separate source and output folders"

While the first option is self explanatory for newbies, the second option could
be advantageously renamed to:
"Create separate folders for sources and class files" 

This way the two options consistently refer to the same thing, and avoid confusion. 
The same would apply to the Build Path preferences page.

A newbie will understand what a class is, but the notion of output folder is
already more sophisticated. 
And an experienced user will have no problem with either labels.

I have helped newbies quite a few time, and know they are getting confused with
those names. Making it more explicit is a minor but important enhancement to
avoid initial confusion.

Also as suggested in Bug#: 99543, newbies would be better served with the second
option as the initial default.

Agree on the renaming. 
We should only rename this on the 'New Java Project'. All other pages should consistently use 'Output folder'
