There is 'add this qualifier' clean up, but there are no 'remove this qualifier'. But what if I have CU with such code style and don't like it?

About this code:
private int i;
void foo(int i) {this.i= i;}

May be just check that there are no SingleVariableDeclaration with same identifier in parent method(s)?

Plus such code is also possible:

public class Test {
	private int field;
	private class Inner {
		private int field;
		public void foo(int i) {
			Test.this.field = i;
		}
	}
}

So, probably we should also check that there are no field hiding in parent classes.

The problem will be to avoid that you get a name conflict with a local variable.
Benno, please investigate if we can detect these cases easely.
