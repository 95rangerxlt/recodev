What about this?
I don't think you can treat all file:/ paths as network paths. 
The real problem shows when storing the location (url.toExternalForm): URL just removes all extra slashes.
Doesn't has eclipse its own abstraction of files (IResources) and can't we use these?
Javadoc locations are URLs, supporting http: and file:
IResources are just for files and folders in the workspace.
Martin, is it ok then do just revert my changes and reopen Bug 118626 for M6?
yes, that's good.
fixed for M6 > I20060328-0010
