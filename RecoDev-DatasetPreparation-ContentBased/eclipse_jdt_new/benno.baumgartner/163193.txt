When using the Source -> Clean Up.. -> Convert for loops to enhanced

        for (int j = 1, jsize = fieldTypes.length; j < jsize; j++) {
            parseClassName(fieldTypes[j].getName());
        }

this gets converted to 

        for (Class element : fieldTypes) {
            parseClassName(element.getName());
        }

These two bits of code are not equal, as the first loops from the index 1, whereas the new code loops from 0.

In this case, the cleanup should ignore it.
