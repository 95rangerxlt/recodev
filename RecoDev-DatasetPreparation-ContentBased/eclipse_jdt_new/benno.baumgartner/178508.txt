The clean up performance tests show that something must have happened between

Reason is that add/remove blocks and convert loops have been splited up into two clean ups which seams to result in many AST been created twice. This was a tread off between performance and code simplicity. The loop converter has become unmaintainable. I did not expect such a high performance hit. Need to investigate why.
