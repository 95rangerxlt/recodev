The quick assists should be enabled when the caret is
- in a keyword (if, else, do, while, for)
- in the condition
- inside a block with a single statement (but not inside the statement itself)

        if (true) { // "Change 'if' block to statement" should be enabled here
            System.out.println("Hello" /*but not here*/ );
        }

All those quick assists should be enabled which can really change the code. Also consider "if ... else if ... else if ... else " sequences and offer to:
- convert all to blocks (unless they are all blocks)
- convert all to statements (unless they are all statements)
- convert the node at caret position to the other form
