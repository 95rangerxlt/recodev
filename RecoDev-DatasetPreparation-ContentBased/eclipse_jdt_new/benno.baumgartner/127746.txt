the point is that the build path actions only need to look at the element when the build path submenu is opened, but not on selction change of when the context menu opens.
The build path actions do some more complicated stuff, so this should stay like that.
I understand that computing the enablement of the 'Build Path' menu may be expensive. My request was that the 'no actions available' item in the submenu should be disabled, as it cannot be executed.
ok, that's easy.
