Scenario:
There is a directory/folder named "bar" somewhere in the workspace. This
directory contains a file also called "bar". The package explorer is used.

Problem:
When trying to move the file "bar" one level up, Eclipse will show a dialog
stating that there already is a file named "bar" in this directory and asking
the user if he really wants to overwrite it. (This is correct so far.)

If the user clicks "Yes" Eclipse will run into an exception and will show this
error dialog: "An exception has been caught while processing the refactoring
'Move'. Reason: Resource /MyProject/bar/bar does not exist." (No entry in .log
is created.)
There are two buttons: "Undo" and "Abort".

No matter what button is clicked, both the directory "bar" and the file "bar"
are lost.

Presumably Eclipse/JDT deletes/overwrites the directory "bar" before the file
"bar" could be read.

Possible solutions:
* Don't allow the user to move a file that is inside a folder with the same
name, so that the file would overwrite the containing directory.
* Or: First make a "backup" copy of the file before replacing the directory with
this file.

(This bug only affects the Package Explorer. The Navigator view does not allow
to move files if the containing directory would be replaced.)

tobias, can you investigate?
The package explorer doesn't even refresh.
We should show a prompt.
Same problem for Project Explorer
Same problem for copy/paste
