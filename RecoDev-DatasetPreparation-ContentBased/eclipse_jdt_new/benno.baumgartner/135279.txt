Fixed order in HEAD, but did not rename so far.

I'm not sure any more that
  - Move Member Type to New File -> Convert Member Type to Top Level
is a good idea. We already had bug 23718, which lead to the current name.
Discussed with Markus, we want to do both of the suggested renames:

  - Move Member Type to New File -> Convert Member Type to Top Level
  - Generalize Type -> Generalize Declared Type

Benno, can you take over?
Fixed in HEAD

Renamed the two actions
