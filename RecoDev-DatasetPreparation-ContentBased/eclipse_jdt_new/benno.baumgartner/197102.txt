Given:
package test;
import java.util.List;
public class E01 {
	List l;
}

package test;
public class E02 {}

1. Open both CUs in editor
2. Select Editor for E01
3. Move 'l' per DnD from E01 to E02
Is: Import is moved, great
4. Save all
5. Move 'l' per DnD from E02 to E01
Is: 
  Import is not moved
Should:
  Be moved

It only works if the drag source is shown in the active editor, very strange...
