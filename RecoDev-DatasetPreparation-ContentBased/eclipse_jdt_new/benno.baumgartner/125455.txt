Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20060125-0800

Take JUnit source and apply all clean ups on it (5.0 level). You get compile errors. Reasons are looking like the following:

if (displayString.startsWith("AllTests")) //$NON-NLS-1$ {
      setIcon(this.fSuiteIcon);
} else {
      setIcon(this.fLeafIcon);
}

Can't tell why yet. 'Add NON NLS tag' should allways be executed after 'Add block to single statement'. May be a problem with the clean up, may also be a problem with the ast rewrite.
