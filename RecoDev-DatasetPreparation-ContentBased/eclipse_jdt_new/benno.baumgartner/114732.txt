- have code:
    private void mm() {}
    private void mm2() {}

- invoke quick fix on mm() to remove the unused private method
- start the clean up with Ctrl+Enter

=> The Clean Up dialog message is:
"Select compilation units on which you want to apply the cleanups. You can
select individual cleanups on the next page."

Expected:
Select compilation units on which you want to apply the 'Remove unused private
methods' cleanups.
