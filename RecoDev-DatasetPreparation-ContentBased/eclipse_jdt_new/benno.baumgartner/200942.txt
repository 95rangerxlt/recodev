Build ID: 3.4 M1

Steps To Reproduce:
This bug can be reproduced using the UA Table of Contents Editor in M1.

1) Open an existing Help Table of Contents, or create one using New > Other... > User Assistance > Help Table of Contents.
--> A TOC Editor should be open at this point.

2) Drag any file without an HTML or XML extension from the Package Explorer to the tree viewer of the TOC Editor.
--> You should see the "drag not allowed" cursor as you move your mouse over the viewer.

3) Drop the file into the tree viewer.
--> Bug: Even though the drop is not allowed, something is happening; there is a flicker of a progress dialog. Nothing should flicker or change, because this drop is invalid.

More information:
Debug tracing indicates that the class JdtViewerDragAdapter is notifying some listeners of the drag event, even though it did not succeed, and one of these listeners is firing a progress dialog.

Attachment 76762 shows a screenshot of this progress dialog.

This is a trace of the method calls that generate the dialog:

ProgressMonitorDialog.run(boolean, boolean, IRunnableWithProgress) line: 494	
FileTransferDragAdapter.runOperation(IRunnableWithProgress, boolean, boolean) line: 245	
FileTransferDragAdapter.handleRefresh(DragSourceEvent) line: 191
