1. Select a package in the breadcrumb
2. press right arrow until you reach a leaf
Is:
 when moving from parent of leaf to leaf actions in the toolbar flicker, it also takes a while move to leaf
Should:
 not flicker, be faster

Reason is that the leaf is revealed and while doing so the focus is set into to text widget resulting in retargeting all the actions.
