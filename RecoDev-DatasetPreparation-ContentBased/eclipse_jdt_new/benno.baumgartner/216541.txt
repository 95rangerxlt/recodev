Eric, I don't understand, what are the expected results? Here is what I get

Given:
@Deprecated public void bar(@SuppressWarnings("unused") int i) {
}

1. 
New line after annotation= true
New line after parameter annotation= true
Is:
@Deprecated 
public void bar(@SuppressWarnings("unused") 
int i) {
}
Expected:
as expected

2. 
New line after annotation= true
New line after parameter annotation= false
Is:
@Deprecated 
public void bar(@SuppressWarnings("unused") 
int i) {
}
Expected:
?

3.
New line after annotation= false
New line after parameter annotation= true
Is:
@Deprecated public void bar(@SuppressWarnings("unused") int i) {
}
Expected:
?

4.
New line after annotation= false
New line after parameter annotation= false
Is:
@Deprecated public void bar(@SuppressWarnings("unused") int i) {
}
Expected:
as expected
