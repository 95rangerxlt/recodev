Code formatter preference page > Line Wrapping: The "Force split" checkbox is cut in some scenarios.

Steps:
- profile dialog > Line Wrapping
- in tree, select Class Declarations > 'extends' clause
- Cancel
- open profile dialog again
- in tree, select Class Declarations
=> checkbox name is "Force split (" now (depending on your font)
=> expected: "Force split (2 of 2)"
(like when you cancel/reopen with Class Declarations selected)
