convert should not be applicable here

   for (Iterator<Integer> iter = removed.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
        Integer id = iter.next();
        //do stuff
        iter.remove(); //after convert this is broken
   } 

or here

   for (Iterator<Integer> iter = removed.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
        Integer id = iter.next();
        //do stuff
        boolean x= iter.hasNext(); //after convert this is broken
   } 

in general, whenever the iterator is used for anything else than the next() call, the conversion should be disabled.

It's quite annoying to have to go back and fix those problems (revert to old code) after I just did clean up.

Also:

        Integer id = iter.next();
