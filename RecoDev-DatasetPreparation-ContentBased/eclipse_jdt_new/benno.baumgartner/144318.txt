The Java development user guide has a topic under Reference called "Java Development Tools (JDT) Basics".  For legal/copyright reasons this can't be in uppercase.  It should be "Java development tools".  (See Platform Plugin Developer Guide > Reference > Other reference information > Glossary of terms)

Also, the "Getting Started > Eclipse and J2SE 5.0" page has the title "Getting started with Eclipse 3.1 and J2SE 5.0".  I suggest dropping "3.1" from the title here.

Thanks John, Benno can you fix this?

Searched and replaced 'Java Development Tools' with 'Java development tools' in jdt/doc/user. And removed Eclipse 3.1 where appropriate.
