3.2 M5

1. select a Java project
2. context menu 'Build Path' > 'Configure Build Path...'
3. select 'Source' tab
4. click 'Add Folder...'

Observe: can no longer add multiple folders

This used to work since day one up to 3.2 M4 and is now broken.

Workaround: select the folders in the Package Explorer and then from the context menu: 'Build Path' > 'Use As Source Folder'.
