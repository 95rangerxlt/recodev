3.1-RC1 test pass

(spawned from bug 96048)
- project settings, library tab
- have a library without javadoc location
- press edit, add a URL, e.g. http://www.example.org

> note that afterwards, the 'Remove' button is disabled. It only gets enabled
for the javadoc location if I move the selection and back.

> the same applies for the source attachment

Annoying, however not critical for 3.1.
released > 20051220

Also fixed same problem for other attributes (source attachment, native lib location and access rules)
