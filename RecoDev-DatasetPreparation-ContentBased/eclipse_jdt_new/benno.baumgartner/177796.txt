See my comment in bug 20793,18
Damn bugzilla. It's bug 20793 comment 18
I agree with Dani with the idea that the option should better be placed on the 'Comments' page. So far we have not mixed comments and code settings and the Comment page already contains options like 'Line width' and 'Remove blank lines'.

You need the patch from bug 20793 to get it to work.
You might want to rephrase the messages not to use "never" and reverse the value of the option for the display.
