1. Go to Preferences>Java>Code Style>Formatter
2. Select "Eclipse built in'
3. Edit...
4. Change the name
5. Select 'Spaces only' as 'Tab policy'
6. Export...
Is:
 The exported profile has 'tab' as 'Tab policy'

I guess the export action does not export the working values (Executing 'Apply' before step 6 solves the problem).
