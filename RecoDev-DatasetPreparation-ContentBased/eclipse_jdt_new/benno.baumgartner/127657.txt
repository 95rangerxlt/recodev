Applying multiple 'add generated serial version ID' shows no progress and is not cancellable. If even a build is running, this can lock the Eclipse UI for a fairly long time.

Steps in my workspace (ZRH plugins from HEAD and all required plugins imported as
binary):
- add implements java.io.Serializable to class ChangeParametersControl and to the nested class ChangeParametersControl.Mode
- invoke quick fix on a warning and press Ctrl+Enter

See also bug 127647 and bug 127652.
