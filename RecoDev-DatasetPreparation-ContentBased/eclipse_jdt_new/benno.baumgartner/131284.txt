Eclipse Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20060217-1115

This is how to reproduce it:
1. In Windows (somewhere on your harddrive) create a folder and copy some (at least more than one) JAR libraries into this folder.
2. Open Eclipse. Use new Project Wizard and create new Java Project from existing source and let it point to the folder you just created in 1). Ensure that the wizard automatically adds the JAR libraries to the project´s build path
3. Finish wizard
4. Open Java Project Properties Dialog on the project, switch to Libraries tab, select all libraries with CTRL-A and hit remove. In the dialog, the libraries disappear
5. Close Properties Dialog and look at the project in Package Explorer: The libraries were not removed. Also if the properties dialog is opened again, they are still there.

It is important, that all libraries need to be selected for remove. If only some are selected, it does work.

Christian
