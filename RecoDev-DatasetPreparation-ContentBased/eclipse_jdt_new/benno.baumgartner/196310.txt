Given:
P01            1
 + bar         2
    + bar      3
    + foo      4

1. Select 3 and 4
2. Drag and drop selection onto 1
3. Dialog asks to 'Skip' 'Skip All' 'Cancel'
4. Select 'Skip All'
Is:
 foo is moved
Should:
 not be moved?

What's the difference between Skip All and Cancel'?
Also the dialog says 'You can skip or cancel' no word said about skip all.

Also the dialog says 'You can skip or cancel' no word said about skip all.
Also the dialog pops up on top of a progress dialog, grrrrr: I've seen that before...
Skip all would only skip the resources with conflicts. All others all still moved.
I will explain that on the dialog. sth like 'You can skip this, skip all conflicting or cancel all'
