I haven't checked other shortcuts, but from the changed summary it looks like *only* F5 accelerator is not working. Is the intention behind the summary change?

Without knowing the implementation, may i venture to say that the action map and key map of the matching package explorer / outline view node should be installed on the relevant breadcrumb bar segment? This way, if future versions of Eclipse add new actions / shortcuts for those views, the breadcrumb bar will get them for free. Of course, this is all a "vapourtalk" and the implementation restrictions might not allow this.

Thanks

Yes, this is what you say in comment#0. But, if you find other key bindings/actions which do not work then please file bugs, we are very interested in finding this actions.

Yes, this is basically what we are trying to achieve. But unfortunately this is way more complex then one might expect.

It appears that F5 is indeed the only shortcut that is not working. It also looks like invoking the "Refresh" from context menu on the breadcrumb bar segment has no effect either. Perhaps this was fixed as a part of this bug.

Great.

The fix fixes both: keybinding and context menu.

Grrr, this introduced a leak
