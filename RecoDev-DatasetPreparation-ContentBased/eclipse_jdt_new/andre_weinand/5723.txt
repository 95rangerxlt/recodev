The first time you bring up the Apply Patch dialog (context menu -> Compare 
With -> Patch...) none of the radio buttons is selected. Should select 
the "Select patch file" radio by default because that is more likely.
The next time you bring up the dialog, it uses the previous setting, so this is 
not a problem. To test this, you will probably have to start with a fresh 
workspace.
