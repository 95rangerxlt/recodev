Using the "Inline Local Variable" refactoring is not possible because the "OK" and 
"Cancel" buttons are disabled although the refactoring would be possible.
Are the buttons accessed by position?
(On Mac OS X the default button is moved to the far right, so the button's indexes are 
different than on other platforms)
Cannot reproduce in M4 on MacOS X
But not for me :( After using Refactor->Inline in M4, the new refactoring UI 
appears with both buttons disabled. Only closing the window is possible. In 
fact, everything seems to be disabled. I cannot use the arrow buttons to 
navigate throught the changes. I cannot even use the scrollbars although the 
controls accept keyboard input.
Does Inline local always reveal this behaviour ? Or is it a special case
Happens always, even when trying to inline test in the following example:

public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String test = "test";
        System.out.println(test);
    }
}

OK, I was wrong: I wasn't on M4 but on HEAD.
And I cannot reproduce the problem on HEAD (because one fix after M4 is related to this 
problem).
