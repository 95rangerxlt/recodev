I20021203 on MacOS X 10.2.2

Trying to start a debug session, I get the following output on the console:

usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i] [-p] src target
       cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i] [-p] src1 .... srcN target

cannot reproduce problem in I20021203.
What is the pathname of the Eclipse application from which 'Bootstrap' is started?
Please attach the script '/tmp/start_carbon.sh' to this report.
the application is under /Users/bpruessm/Desktop/Eclipse Test/
Created attachment 2642
start_carbon.sh
I suspect the space character in "/Users/bpruessm/Desktop/Eclipse Test/" is the problem.
I'll verify if my startup script can deal with it. 
If possible please remove the space and try again!

Hey, that's a good test case :-)
There is another space in "/Users/bpruessm/Desktop/Eclipse Bauhaus/Eclipse.app/
Contents/MacOS/Eclipse"...
You're right. Changing the path fixed _that_ debug problem. However, now I get:

Error occured during initialization of VM
java.lang.Error: java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException: MacRoman

Adding charsets.jar to the Installed VM more or less resolved the problem but 
then I get:

[JavaAppLauncher Error] FindClass() failed for class 
apple/launcher/LaunchRunner:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
apple/launcher/LaunchRunner

NB: I am using JDK 1.4.1DP6
fixed start_carbon.sh released on 20021204

(the other problem seems to be DP1.4.1 related; If I remember correctly there were a 
thread on the java-seed mailing list. If its really an Eclipse problem we need a new 
problem report for this)


Debug doesn't work
