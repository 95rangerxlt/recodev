Mac OSX: 10.2.8
Eclipse: 200309250800

Exporting Javadoc and selecting JDK referenced classes produced this error:

javadoc: Error fetching URL: file:/Developer/Documentation/Java/Reference/1.4.1/package-list

The correct path appears to be: /Developer/Documentation/Java/Reference/1.4.1/doc/api/package-list

Moving to jdt.ui

thanks Andre
In eclipse build 200309300800, the default JRE is 1.4.1, but the javadoc command is pointing to 1.3.1

Channing
What exactly do you mean by "the javadoc command is pointing to 1.3.1"?
I've just installed I20030930 with a fresh workspace, imported JUnit, and generated JavaDoc for it.
The documentation of JUnit correctly links to 
Developer/Documentation/Java/Reference/1.4.1/doc/api/*
Under Preferences, the my JVM is set to 1.4.1, but the Javadoc command is /System/Library/
Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Home/bin/javadoc but should be /System/Library/
Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.1/Home/bin/javadoc

Andre, I have managed to confuse myself with another javadoc bug,  Bug 43795. I think the javadoc 
command being 1.3.1 when the JDK is 1.4.1 is probably a new bug?

Channing

Yes, please file a feature request for this (javadoc command should correspond to default JDK).
will do.


Javadoc: default JDK 1.4.1 reference doc path is incorrect
