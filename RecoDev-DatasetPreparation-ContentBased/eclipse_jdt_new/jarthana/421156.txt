A new enum (Modifier#DEFAULT) has been added in SE 1.8 and APT should start supporting this modifier for default interface methods. At the moment it's not very clear what's the right way - to move the project to 1.8 compliance level or use reflection or some other means to include DEFAULT.

I will investigate.

If using reflection will work, let us use that - I don't fully understand
yet the implications of moving APT source projects to 1.8.
I think a better approach would be to use Modifier.valueOf("DEFAULT"), guarded by a catch block.

Sounds good.

Proposed fix

Patch provides support for 'default' modifier in ExecutableElement. The fix also required one change in BinaryTypeBinding to restore the default modifier from the .class and some minor clean-up changes.

Tests are still running after which I will request for a quick review from Srikanth.
All tests passed.

Srikanth, can you take a glance when you have time? TIA!
I fixed an error message that was complaining about incorrect annontations
instead of incorrect modifiers are released the patch here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=725055f2b34cdbfae0fb11f5bfd68ad41728348a
