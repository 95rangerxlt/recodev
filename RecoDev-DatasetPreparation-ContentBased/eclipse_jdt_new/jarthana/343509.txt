Could you please also release the patch in Eclipse 3.6.2+?

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #337415 +++

When the preferences and the project are imported using ANT script, the external folders project is not created causing potentially dangerous behavior (f.e. no delta can be computed, so each build is a full build).

The steps to reproduce the behavior are:
1. Import the projects from attached zip file
2. Inside the Data project there are two launch configurations.
3. Execute the "Headless Import"
4. Refresh the Data project. runtimeData folder contains new workspace, check in the .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.core if the external folders project exists.

Two other projects are ant tasks responsible for loading the preferences and importing the project. The second launch configuration ("Verification") launches Eclipse which uses the same workspace as the headless one, so it is possible to check if the classpath variable has been correctly loaded.

Makes sense but I suggest to wait a bit to see how the fix plays in the field.
I guess it's time to backport this now.

Patch on R3_6_maintenance branch - includes patches from bug 337415 and bug 320618, which is a prerequisite for the fix.
Tested the patch. The fix is working and the existing tests are passing as well.
Dani, we need PMC approval for this. TIA.
Path is good but the copyright date needs to be updated in all files.

+1 for 3.6.2+.
