Use the ASTView on the following code and get an error dialog about 'Bad AST Node structure.

package p;
public class X  {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
    	W w = (@Marker W<String>) null;
    }
}
class W<T> {
}
@java.lang.annotation.Target (java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Marker {}

The problem appears that in this particular case the AnnotatableType (@Marker W<String>) doesn't include the annotation in it's source range.

Looks like the problem is for the ParameterizedType's SimpleType, which is "@Marker W" and NOT "@Marker W<String>" as I had mentioned earlier.

Jay: This issue will be resolved when bug 413569 is solved. You can use the WIP patch at: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=235631 as well and get an early look at the solution.

bug 413569 is resolved. Is the present one resolved too ? If so, could we add a 
test and close this one please ?
The issue is fixed as already reported by bug 413569. I wasn't sure if any of the current tests in ASTConvert18Test cover this scenario. In any case, I have added a new test in ASTConverter18Test.testBug417669().
