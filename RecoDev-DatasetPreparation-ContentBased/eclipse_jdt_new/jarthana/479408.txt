It is now possible to load JRE 9 images from within JRE 8. The page [1] talks about it a bit. Even though Oracle has said JRE 7 is not in the picture, it will be nice to get this update to JDT.

The idea seems to be loading the JRE 9 image through the class loader of the jrt-fs.jar that is present in JAVA 9 home.

I pushed the fix along with on other change via:

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA9&id=47951bc74ff786f2e135fc227fd365dcdb97cd7a

The other change is the omission of jdk.* modules from the jimage.
