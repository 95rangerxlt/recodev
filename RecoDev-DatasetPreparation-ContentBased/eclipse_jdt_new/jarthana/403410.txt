The latest spec doesn't allow modifiers on explicit 'this' parameters:

FormalParameterOrReceiverDecls:
Type [Identifier .] this [, FormalParameterDecls]
FormalParameterDecls

The javac allows final but rejects static. But as per the spec, all modifiers should be rejected on receiver params.

Proposed fix

Just a note about having the modifier check for receiver in AbstractMethodDeclaration.resolveReceiver() - The only reason for doing this is to get the correct range for error reporting.
