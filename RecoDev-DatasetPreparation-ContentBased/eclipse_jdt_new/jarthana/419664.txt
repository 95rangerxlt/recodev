BETA_JAVA8:

(1) 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.apt.model.Factory.getAnnotationsByType(AnnotationBinding[], Class<A>) returns an Annotation[] - this is wrong. It should return
an A[].

(2) We should make a best case effort to match up AnnotationMirror#toString()
output with javac, so that testing can be easy

Patch for item 1

Patch for the first item. I am investigating some more inconsistencies in the implementation of toString by Javac. But this need not wait. 

Srikanth, I am having some issues running the tests. Can you please run the tests and if they are fine, release the patch for me. Thanks!

Patch looks good. Remembering to change the use EMPTY_ANNOTATIONS was
good. I also fixed a couple of places that were using result1[0].getClass()
to instead use annotationType directly. 

APT tests look good. Running all Java 8 tests.

Tests are green. Released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=a2380c5dc7487191ba2f073fdb6868b729cb0c57

Thanks Jay.
This is already resolved. The toString() differences can be addressed
in a different bug if we feel the need for it.


[1.8] getAnnotationByType() returns the wrong array type leading to CCE.



First batch of fixes for Bug 419664 - [1.8] A couple of issues with Eclipse implementation of Java 8 support.
