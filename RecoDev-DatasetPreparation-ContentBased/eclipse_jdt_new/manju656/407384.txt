Bug 407383 creates the initial document with all the M1-M7 JDT items. Those items now need to be grouped, like in the past release [1]. Similar items need to be collapsed into one.

Try to create a logical "flow" inside each group, so that readers find similar items close to each other. The items should be ordered by similarity, not by milestones in which they appeared.

Also make sure the images adhere to the rules:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.news.git/plain/platform/4.3/whats-new-template/eclipse-whats-new-template.html

No horizontal scroll bar should appear when you open the N&N in an out-of-box help window. You can test this by starting a clean runtime workbench and opening the help document without resizing anything. If all images are correct and you still see a horizontal scroll bar, then the problem is probably a <pre> section with an excessively long line.
Logically grouped the items in JDT and is released as:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=ce825257084bed465143c8734c62069702bb3857

Modified one of the image (combine-strings.png) so as to prevent the horizontal scroll bar from appearing.
Markus, please adjust the doc while reviewing or reopen this bug if you find bigger issues.
