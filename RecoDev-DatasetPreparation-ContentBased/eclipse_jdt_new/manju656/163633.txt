There is no preview of the package overview in package-info.java in the Javadoc view.

I would propose to show the Javadoc preview in one of these cases:
a) The package is selected in the package explorer.
b) The file package-info.java is selected in the Java editor.


By the same token, I would like to see the overview file as well. This would be more tricky, as the file has to be identified as overview first, and associated with, for example, a source folder or the project.
If this is not on anyones list yet, I might put it in an extra ticket as minor enhancement.
Opinions on that?

Please one feature/bug per report. This one will treat the package-info.java request.

There are currently no plans to work on this but a high quality patch will be appreciated.
Added overview file request in 163926.
See also bug 77451 (show package.html).
This bug should be addressed in conjunction with bug 86168 and bug 113946 to round out the package Javadoc support.
Manju, there could be an additional complication with package-info in the source attachment.

E.g. in jdk7, the src.zip contains java/lang/package-info.java, but since the package declaration doesn't carry annotations, no package-info.class file is generated. Hence, the IClassFile for package-info doesn't exist and getSource() probably doesn't work. Once you've verified that this is really a problem, please file a bug for JDT/Core requesting that IClassFile#getSource() should still work in this special case.
Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=2a9ffe29bdd06c14d706d8f3865ef59c1255be9e
