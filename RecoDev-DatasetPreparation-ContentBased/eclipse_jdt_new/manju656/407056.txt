Support the new PackageQualifiedType AST node from bug 404489 in JDT UI.

The node occurs when a type-use annotation is added to a package-qualified type. Before, such types were represented as SimpleType(QualifiedName).

See the explanations in the Javadoc of QualifiedType in BETA_JAVA8.

Support the new PackageQualifiedType AST node from bug 404489 in JDT UI.

The node occurs when a type-use annotation is added to a package-qualified type. Before, such types were represented as SimpleType(QualifiedName).

See the explanations in the Javadoc of QualifiedType in BETA_JAVA8.
Note that ASTRewrite has not yet been implemented for this node (bug 406469). But we can still start with identifying problem areas and working on solutions.
The issue to be tackled with this bug is to fix all the places where we currently assume the SimpleType(QualifiedName) structure. I.e. ASTVisitors and any other code that:
- assumes it knows it gets a SimpleType(QualifiedName), but now gets a PackageQualifiedType
- assumes that the parent of a QualifiedName or a SimpleName must be one of the old a subtypes of Type, but now it can also be a PackageQualifiedType
Updated the potential locations where PackageQualifiedType can occur in JDT UI except in #thrownExceptionTypes. Need to perform one more round of checking once the bug 403924 which deals with updating MethodDeclaration#thrownExceptions() with MethodDeclaration#thrownExceptionTypes() is resolved. #thrownExceptionTypes() can return a List with SimpleType and PackageQualifiedType. Hence i'm holding the patch for the time being.

WIP Patch

This is a WIP patch. Uploading this in case Noopur you have time to look into it once bug 403923 is completed.
I meant bug 403924 in my previous comment.

Patch created against BETA_JAVA8 ws

I have created the patch after updating most of the potential locations where PackageQualifiedType can occur in JDT UI. Below are the files where SimpleType(QualifiedName/SimpleName) usage appears but I have ignored them as I felt PackageQualifiedType could not occur in those scenario. Listing the files ignored for verification.
=> ASTNodeFactory.java (2 matches): 
	-> 286: if (type instanceof SimpleType) { 
	-> 354: if (type instanceof SimpleType) { 
In the above locations, type is created via ImportRewrite.addImport(..) and that never returns a PQT. Hence ignored the occurrence of PQT in the above cases.

=> MoveInnerToTopRefactoring.java (3 matches) -> Here the QualifiedName of a SimpleType is used to handle the import statement, hence ignoring the occurrence of PQT at this place.

=> Java50Fix.java#isRawTypeReference(ASTNode) -> This method handles only a SimpleType. What is the usecase, is it possibe that the type can be a PackageQualifiedType at this point?

The above assumption would be wrong after bug 417937 is fixed. ImportRewrite.addImport(..) can return a NQT.

That's correct in general, but we know this can't happen for an annotation type, because the grammar doesn't allow type annotations on such a type name reference.
The newAnnotation(..) methods have been moved into ImportRewrite, where it's safe to keep this assumption.
