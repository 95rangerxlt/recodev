BETA_JAVA8:

This ER will be used as the master/umbrella entry for search engine changes
to support Java 8. Please don't attach patches/fixes here. Any high level
discussions can be had here, but all activity should be on broken down blocker
unit level tasks each with its own bug number.

Some quick experiments show that the search engine as is is able to discover
types and variables properly for lambda expressions.

For type annotations and reference expressions, there are various things
that appear broken.

This can be released. 
We can add JSR 335 tests later as a separate patch
Search for JSR 308 constructs is complete except for Bug 400919.
Here also we should arrange to hook the tests to RunAllJava8Tests

This umbrella bugs has served its purpose. The couple of still open issues
are tracked on their own ticket. Resolving.
