BETA_JAVA8:

This test asserts in the last line: 

assertEquals("Wrong qualified name", "test404489.bug.X.Y",
binding.getQualifiedName())

The bindings qualified name is actually test404489.bug.X.

I have disabled this line. Please reenable after fix.

Proposed Patch

Note: Change under PQTR switch in DefaultBindingResolver.resolveType() is for avoiding duplication when method extract refactoring was done.
Manoj, looks like we could use the existing resolveTypeBindingForName() method for this. It seem to do a bit more, but we use it in other cases too. So, it may not be a bad idea to have something like this:


if (type instanceof SimpleType && node instanceof QualifiedTypeReference) {
					return resolveTypeBindingForName(((SimpleType)type).getName());
				} else if (type instanceof QualifiedType) {
					return resolveTypeBindingForName(((QualifiedType)type).getName());
				} else if (type instanceof PackageQualifiedType){
					return resolveTypeBindingForName(((PackageQualifiedType)type).getName());
				}
What do you think?

Jay, thanks for reviewing this. If possible, let us settle for a solution
that reuses existing machinery.

Proposed Patch

Jay: Thanks for the review. Your suggestion looks good. Have updated the patch with the suggested modification.
Patch looks good, although it seems to do lot more in the specific case we are testing. But it's consistent with the existing code for other TypeReference.

Tests are being run, will release when they complete.
Released on behalf of Manoj via commit:
