Repro:
1. Build APT branch (see org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/howtobuildme.txt).
2. Into the built workspace, import attached demo.zip. This contains annotation
processor for TypeGeneratingAnnotation.
3. Debug workspace into which attached demoUserProject.zip has been imported.
4. Open demo.Quack.java in user project.
5. Uncomment import and reference to GeneratedFileTest type.
6. Add and remove the @TypeGeneratingAnnotation to/from the class.

Manifestations:
1. When you add @TypeGeneratingAnnotation to the Quack class (and sometimes when
you remove same), the workspace will build over and over again, and the
generated type will appear and disappear from the project.
2. When you save the file, the looping behavior will stop, in either the
annotation add or remove case. So apparently this only happens on the recomcile
code path.
3. If you remove the references to the generated type (both the import and
reference) the problem goes away.

source file to repro the bug (Quack.java)

This seems to be caused by reconcile triggering a build, and build triggering 
a reconcile, and on & on.

Gary, for a quick work-around, disable auto-build on your project.


Dropping severity since there is a work-around. 

Should now be fixed since reconcile type-generation only works on in-memory 
copies, and doesn't touch disk.
