Markus, any additional steps. I can't reproduce this.
This is a timing & event notification problem. For details see 87289
As of 3.1M6 (build I20050401-1645) on Linux/gtk/JDK 1.5.0_02/x86-32, after a
refactor->rename I can undo using both edit->undo and refactor->undo.

However:

I had to change the general->editors->text editors->undo history size, exit
Eclipse and restart for the change to take effect.  Before that, edit->undo was
always disabled even though th history size was set to 25.
I have set the undo history size to "1024" and cannot undo after a refactoring.

Tested with 3.1M6.

Regarding comment #3:

- the refactoring and text edit undo are still not bound to each other. So 
  changing the editors undo size will not affect refactoring undo

Regarding comment #4:

- Victor, which refactoring did you execute. For example some move refactorings
  are undoable right now. Can you remember which one revealed the behavior.

With M7 we will convert to the new operation history which will make the problem
described in comment #2 go away.
My favorite refactoring is rename.

BUT it was not the refactoring, which was not undoable.

1. I refactored the class.
2. I added some strings.
3. I deleted the strings.
4. Tried to get the strings back by
 - Tried Ctrl+Z => nothing
 - Tried Edit -> Undo, but Undo is grayed out
Closing the editor for the specific file and reopening it reenables the "Undo"
functionality.

Will this be fixed in 3.1M7?
Yes, this got fixed by merging refactoring into the global undo stack.
Marking as fixed.
