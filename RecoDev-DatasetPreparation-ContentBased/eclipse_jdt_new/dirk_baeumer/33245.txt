All other source and refactoring actions are disabled in this case. The 
operation unavailable dialog states, that the user has to select a valid Java 
element which he did. So we should disable the search actions as well.
Unable to reproduce. Not sure what triggered it.

Comment 2 is not correct it can be reporduced.

The problem is the grouping of the Java search groups: the main group delegates
to sub-groups. When switching to a non-Java editor the NullActionGroup replaces
the whole search sub-groups which would have the responsibility to set the
action handler.

This leaves to old actions in place which can lead to strange results: for
example a search for declarations gives results from the other editor.

Note: The action are enabled if the Outline view has focus because the selected
element is a Java element.
Fixed by enabling all actions of CUs outside the build path. The actions check 
in run if the element is on build path. Disabling is not possible since a CU 
can be moved from outside the build path onto the build path. In this case the 
editor is reused.

For 2.2 we have to come up with a better story here.


Search->References/Dec/Imp/Read/Write enabled when editing java file outside source folders, in non-java projects and from cvs repository.
