- open "Push Down" dialog for a method that calls a private method
- press "Preview"
-> You get some errors.
- scroll through the errors using the next action in the upper right corner
  -> the preview is first feeded with the new document and caret offset 0 and 
then reposition to the error offset. This is distracting. setRedraw should be 
called around the two method invocations.

that'd affect every refactoring - it's the error dialog
