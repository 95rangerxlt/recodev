the <preview> <ok> <cancel> dialog shows up, but <ok> has the same effect as
<cancel> and <preview> would only show movements of files and no changes in
imports of other java files. on <ok> in the preview it only moves the file(s)
(as indicated ) without changing referencing imports.

strange - works for me
Dirk's doing something in this area now - i'll see maybe he's released 
something problematic
yup - i caught up now and see it too
i guess no everything is released because i also get this:
