1. make Java file read-only and delete a method in it
2. On the first dialog, press ok, a 'Found Problems' dialog shows up
3. The dialog has two buttons:
Back and cancel

Back is not too helpfull as you can't change anything on the first dialog
Cancel should probably be better 'Ok'

Reworking this depends on the overall refactoring story. This is planned for 
M3/M4. Postponing PR until then.
Haven't started yet to make this API. Have to postpone until then. Marking the 
PR as 3.0.
Fixed for M9.


Delete: buttons on the 'Found Problems' page [refactoring]
