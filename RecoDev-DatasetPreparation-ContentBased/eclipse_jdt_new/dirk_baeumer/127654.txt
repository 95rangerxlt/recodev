Use the Package Explorer in working set mode and make sure to show overlapping working sets i.e. same file visible multiple times.

Select that file (not the first one) and then Context menu > Rename...
==> selection jumps to first occurrence of the file in the Package Explorer.

Expected: selection stays stable.

My test case was to use exportplugin.xml from JDT UI (HEAD).

Dirk, interested in having a look at this? Otherwise move back.
The selection is now kept stable by JFace viewer. Will look if this something the package explorer can fix. Otherwise have to move to Platform/UI.
The problem is on yout end. When refactoring selects the new element C it has to take into consideration that the selection can be a tree path selection. If so it has to adjust the whole path not only the last element. The code to look at is in class RenameUserInterfaceStarter#restore.

This is not new. The problem already existed in 3.1 Postponing to RC1.
In addition PackageExplorerPart#convertSelection has to treat TreeSelection as well. It can't simply create a new structured selection.

A patch assuming that we have the addtional API in JFace
Fixed for RC1.
