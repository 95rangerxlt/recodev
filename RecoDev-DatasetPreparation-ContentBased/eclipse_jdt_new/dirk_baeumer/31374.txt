Build: RC0

Package explorer view now shows non-Java projects, however if these projects 
have linked folders, it does not show what is in these linked folders.

1. Start with a fresh workspace.
2. File->Import...->External plug-ins and fragments-> Uncheck the copy option 
(i.e. import with linking) -> select org.eclipse.swt and org.eclipse.swt.win32 -
>Finish
3. The org.eclipse.swt project should have a Java nature while the other one 
should not.
4. Expand org.eclipse.swt.win32 (ie. the non-Java project) in the Package 
Explorer view. You will see the 'os' and 'ws' folders, but you cannot see what 
they contain.  You can only see their contents in the Resource view.

Wassim, that works for me using build 200302061700.

Please reopen if you can reproduce the problem.
Dirk,
I can definitely reproduce it in M5 (RC0) following the steps I described 
above.
After importing org.eclipse.swt and org.eclipse.swt.win32 *with* linking, I 
can see the linked folders org.eclipse.swt.win32/os and 
org.eclipse.swt.win32/ws in the package explorer view, but I cannot see what 
they contain.  I have to switch to the navigator view to see their contents.
OK, was able to reproduce on my workstation.
Fixed for > I20030206
