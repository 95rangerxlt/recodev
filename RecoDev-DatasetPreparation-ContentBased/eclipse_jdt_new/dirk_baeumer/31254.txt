Change Method signature refactoring: Doubleclick should open edit window
I just saw that when opening the wizard, the table is has an edit cursor. In 
that case, of course double clicking has a different meaning.

There is a strange behaviour that when you select an entry and press 'up', the 
edit cursor is gone and the full line is selected. That's where i missed the 
double click. But this seems to be a bug that the table goes in full line 
selection mode

Renamed the bug report
Should be addressed.
