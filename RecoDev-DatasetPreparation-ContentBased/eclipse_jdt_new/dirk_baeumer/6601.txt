This problem got fixed by separating the ExceptionAnalyzer from the 
StatementAnalyzer. It is now ensured that visit and endVisit calls are 
symmetrical (if you get a visit call you get an endVisit call). This wasn't the 
case in the old implementation. So when you got an endVist call without a visit 
call the stack could have been empty.
