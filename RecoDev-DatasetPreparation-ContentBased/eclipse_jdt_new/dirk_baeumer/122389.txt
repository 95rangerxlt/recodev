The following test passes before "extract method," but fails afterward.  Build id: I20051102-1600

import junit.framework.TestCase;

public class A extends TestCase{
	
    private int getGridY(int y) {
        int tmp = 0, res = 1;
        while (res < y) {
        	//extract here
            tmp = res;
            res += 1;
            //to here
        }
        return tmp;
    }
    
    public void testCase(){    	
    	assertEquals(getGridY(7),6);
    }
}

Still exists in I20051215-1506.

The problem is that extracting the code shouldn't be allowed since both tmp and res are modified inside the code to be extracted and both are read afterwards.
Problem was caused by loop reentrance. Fixed for >= I20060110.
