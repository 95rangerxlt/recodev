package p;
class A{
}
class AS extends A{
	AS fff(){return this;}
	int yyy(){return 32;}
	void g(){
		int f= fff().yyy();//select fff here
	}
}

select the fff in the indicated line and extract as method
you get
package p;
class A{
}
class AS extends A{
	AS fff(){return this;}
	int yyy(){return 32;}
	void g(){
		int f= method()().yyy();//select fff here
	}
	private void method() {
		fff;
	}
}

which has 2 syntax errors
