I20051102-1600 + ZRH-plugins from 20051108_1233

As in the smoke test, extract the lines
		constraintsLogo1.gridx = 2; constraintsLogo1.gridy = 0;
		constraintsLogo1.gridwidth = 1; constraintsLogo1.gridheight = 1;
		constraintsLogo1.anchor = GridBagConstraints.CENTER;
		getContentPane().add(logo, constraintsLogo1);
in junit.swingui.AboutDialog(JFrame parent) into a new method.

The last change 'add new method computeConstraint' also shows other changes than
adding the method. Deselecting the change produces the right result (method not
added).

Actually the change view shows the correct thing (from a AST rewriter point of view). The methods are moved to a new method to keep existing formatting. That's why they show up as removed lines.

To reduce confusion I rephrased the message to "Create new method {0} from selected statements

Creating a preview which exactly matches the expectation would basically mean rewriting how extract method does the AST rewriting. I therefore opt to leave it as it is now.
