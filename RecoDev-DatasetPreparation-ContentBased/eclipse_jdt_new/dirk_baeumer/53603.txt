I would like to have this as well. Having to click a dozen times to get to the 
search results is really annoying.

Added the actions.
I copied a couple of icons from JDT:

/org.eclipse.search/icons/full/dlcl16/collapseall.gif
/org.eclipse.search/icons/full/elcl16/collapseall.gif

and sligthly changed them to look like this:

/org.eclipse.search/icons/full/dlcl16/expandall.gif
/org.eclipse.search/icons/full/elcl16/expandall.gif

Dirk, can I let you take care of the artwork and close the PR?
Artwork released. Marking as fixed.


[search] the new search view needs expand all/collapse all actions



fix for bug 53603
