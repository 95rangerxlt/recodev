this is noticed in 20020425 build
f1 build - problem is still there
I have noticed this issue as well with Release GM5.  I prefer to use a
slate-gray background color with chalk-colored text.  This bug makes certain
portions of the Preferences dialog difficult to use.

The issue is not limited to just the Templates editor.  It also affects the
"Code Formatter" portion of the Preferences dialog and some of the Refactoring
dialogs such as "Pull Up" and "Externalize Strings."
this is all caused by bug 22990
Unassign due to staff changes.

Moving to JDT UI to address refactoring issues mentioned in comment 3 (note: I
already fixed the externalize string wizard and would have done it for
refactoring as well but wasn't sure if this is desired by the refactoring guys).
The refactoring issues got fixed for M6 (see bug 47856).


[preferences] Template editor doesn't inherit Java editor's background color.
