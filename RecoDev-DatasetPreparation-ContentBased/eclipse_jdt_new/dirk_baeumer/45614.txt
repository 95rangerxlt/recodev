A dialog comes up under the Pull up refactoring that says"Select the methods to
be removed in subtypes after pull up."  The right hand panel shows java code for
the selected method.  It *assumes* the background color should be white, when it
should not.  It should be the same color as defined for Java editors.  See
#43368, #42704, #42703, & #41867

The next wizard page ("Review the information provided in the list below. Click
'Next' to view the next item or 'Finish'") has the same problem.
We have to use a JavaSourceViewerConfiguration in this case. Have to talk to

Fix for next integration build.
