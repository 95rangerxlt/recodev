This bug reports that inline method has the same problem that inline constant 
does as reported in bug #26581: "Inline Constant: Weird behaviour in the 'no 
references' case".

Specifically, try to use the refactoring in a case where the method in question 
is not called.  Uncheck the "Delete method declaration" checkbox.  Press the 
Next button, and observe that some activity occurs in the progress meter, but 
nothing else happens.

We should solve the problem in the same way in both inline method and inline 
constant.

We could display a message near the top of the input page, or we could flip to 
the problems page and display a message.

Originally, I assumed that the refactoring would simply proceed to the preview 
page and, thus, indicate that no changes were necessary. (I.e. I didn't now 
that an empty change needed special handling).

IMO the wizard should handle this case and should show a special preview saying 
that no changes have to be applied. Using an error for this case feels wrong.
Sounds good to me.  This sounds more in line what I had assumed would happen 
(the empty preview page), as opposed to the current behaviour and what this 
current behaviour might suggest as a complete solution.
It is debatable, however, and some people favour an approach where the lack of 
changes is indicated on the input page itself.

The preview page now shows a label saying that no source code updates are 
needed.


Inline Method:  needs special handling for case where change is empty
