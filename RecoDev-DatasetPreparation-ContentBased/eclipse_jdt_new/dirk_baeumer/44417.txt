Thanks Dmitry.

One minor thing: you can't compare bindings using identity. JDT/Core only 
ensure identity for bindings for local members. You should always use 
Bindings.equals(....) to accomplish this.
Dirk, thank you for your comments.

Next time I will definitely use Bindings.equals.


inline call a field initializer: could detect self reference [refactoring]
