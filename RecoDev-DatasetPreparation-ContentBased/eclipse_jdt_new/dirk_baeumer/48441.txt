Hi,
Extract Interface does not add all necessary imports.
Here is an example

package aaa;

public class Uno {

	public void pippo() {
	}
}

---
package bbb;

public class Due {

	public Due() {
		Uno uno = new Uno();
	}
}

classes are in two different files.
Make an Extract Interface on Uno, enter name If, check "Change references to
class 'Uno' into references to the interface" and select method pippo. Ok.
You'll get a compilation error in class Due for the missing If import.

Extract Interface does not add import with "Change references..."
