which formatting option isn't honored?
I set the formating to be:
try
{
 ....
}
catch (Exception e)
{
}

but the output of "surround with try/catch" is:
try {
 ...
} catch (Exception e) {
}

Furthermore if the selection for surround with try/catch is just one line,
this line gets outside the try block in the output.
(I am using build 20020409)
All refactorings now use the code formatter to format newly generated code.

Fixed in build > I20020425


Surround with try/catch does not use the formatting configuration
