consider the code fragment:

{
  ...
  final File testFile = new File("testFile);
  ...
}

after surrounding with a try/catch Block I got something like:
{
  ...
  final File testFile;
  try
  {
    testFile = new File("testFile); 
  }
  catch (IOException e)
  {
    e.printStackTrace();
  } 
  ...
}
The Problem here is that the Compiler complains about the final declaration.
I suggest to remove the final from the declaration.

jdt ui, not doc
Correct, but not critical enough to be fixed for 2.1. We are already working 
on release candidate 3.
Reopening...
Fixed for >= I20060110.
