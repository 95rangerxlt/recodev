If I compile a simple class in Eclipse with the following compliance settings, it won't run in a 1.4 
JVM.  It appears the .class file relies on 1.5 libraries, despite the compatibility setting.

Compiler compliance: 1.5
Generated .class compatibility: 1.4
Source compatibility: 1.5

Here's my source code:

public class TestConcat {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    String w = "world";
    System.out.println("Hello " + w);
  }
}

The resulting exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java/lang/StringBuilder
        at TestConcat.main(TestConcat.java:13)

This mode should not be allowed. Source 1.5 implies target 1.5 or better (like 
source 1.4 requires target 1.4 or better).
Fixed in HEAD. Will be in next I-build.


[1.5] class file with "1.4 compatibility" cannot be run in Java 1.4
