Collection properties in ExpressionInfo v01

We need to enhance the ExpressionInfo to return any property names that an expression has accessed.  This information can for example be used to decide whether an expression tree has to be reevaluated if we are notified that a property changes.

We need to enhance the ExpressionInfo to return any property names that an expression has accessed.  This information can for example be used to decide whether an expression tree has to be reevaluated if we are notified that a property changes.
patch released with changes:
- using Set instead of List
- API renamed to 'addAccessedPropertyName' instead of 'addPropertyNameAccess' to be symmetrical to 'getAccessedPropertyNames'

- core expression plug-in version changed to 3.4.0

Shouldn't these also be merged, see ExpressionInfo#merge*() methods?

Please also update the ExpressionInfoTests in the org.eclipse.core.expressions.tests plug-in.
