The platform supports the concept of a dialog font. Most plug-ins have migrated 
to this new support and JDT UI (search, compare, junit) now looks inconsistent.

We should fix this inconsistency.

Released JDT/UI patches
Comments from Martin Aeschlimann:

Reviewed, seems to be ok.

NewTypeWizardPage: remove the change, only a (unneeded) import was added
SourceAttachmentPropertyPage: 1 case is missed (line 73)
SourceAttachmentBlock & NameConventionConfigurationBlock: No changes needed as 
the containers of the blocks already set the font

Comments are correct except for NameConventionConfigurationBlock. The change 
is the nested class NameConventionInputDialog, which is a dialog.

bad font in Override/implement 'group methods by types'
other bad ones i found so far:
- pde plugin search (most controls are bad)
- java debug pref page
- installed jre pref page
- compare with local history

- compare with local history is OK in RC3a


Problems on MacOS X:
- dialog fonts are not propagated into
         TabFolders
         Text fields
- "Java Element Filters" dialog (strange because it doesn't use TabFolders)
- Install/Update pref page: Proxy Settings group
- Java pref page: all groups are wrong (strange, because other groups seem to work)
- Javadoc pref page
