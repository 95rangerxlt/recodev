StackOverflow in TypeVariable#getPrettySignature(..) for recursive type variable
definition. E.g. try to print the return type of Collections.min(..), which is
"<T extends Object & Comparable<? super T>>".

The problem is that "T" in "<? super T>" is not just printed as "T", but it is
erroneously expanded - infinitely. The bounds of a type variable should only be
printed when the type variable declaration is printed (and not for references).

Fixed, but not for todays integration build.
