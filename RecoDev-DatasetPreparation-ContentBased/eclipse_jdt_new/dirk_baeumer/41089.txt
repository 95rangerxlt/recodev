When changing the background color on the Java > Editor > Syntax page 
from "System Default" to "Custom", and then selecting a solid black, many of 
the Eclipse edit control backgrounds that display code, such as 
the "Externalize Strings" wizard's "Context" edit control and the Templates 
edit controls, don't make use of that black background. This makes the 
contents of those backgrounds difficult to read.

Kai, 

we are configuring the source viewer in the following way:

int styles= SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.MULTI | SWT.BORDER | 
SWT.FULL_SELECTION;
fSourceViewer= new SourceViewer(c, null, styles);
fSourceViewer.configure(new JavaSourceViewerConfiguration(tools, null));
fSourceViewer.getControl().setFont(JFaceResources.getFont
(PreferenceConstants.EDITOR_TEXT_FONT));

Is there anything else to do to pick up the right back-ground color ?

Asking JDT/Text for comments.
Fixed for preference pages (formatter, templates, code generation).

Dirk, you either need to set fg/bg colors yourself or use a JavaSourceViewer.

Also fixed externalize strings wizard.

This got addressed for 3.0.
This bug most certainly still exists. See, for instance, the Java detail formatter preference. In fact, it seems that there is not a SINGLE dialog box or preference not related directly to syntax highlighting which colors the background correctly.
