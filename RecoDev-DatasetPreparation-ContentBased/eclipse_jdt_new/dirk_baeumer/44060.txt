1. Have this code:

public class C {
	private Object fO;
	
	public void method0() {
		Object o= fO;
		fO= new Object();
		fO= o;
	}

	public void method1() {
<line1>		Object o= fO;
<line2>		fO= new Object();
<line3>		fO= o;
	}
}

2. Try to extract either of the marked lines (one at a time)

-> line 1 will be recognized as a duplicate of the similar code in method0, but
not line2 and line3
