package p;
class A{	
	void fg(){
		Object t= /*[*/this/*]*/;
	}
}

the message says that a statement is selected, which is not true;
same here:

package p;
class A{	
	void fg(){
                Object t= null;
                Object t2= /*[*/t/*]*/;
	}
}

package p;
class A{	
	void fg(){
		Object t= /*[*/this/*]*/;
	}
}

the message says that a statement is selected, which is not true;
same here:

package p;
class A{	
	void fg(){
                Object t= null;
                Object t2= /*[*/t/*]*/;
	}
}
Message is now: No uncaught exceptions are thrown by the selected code.

Fixed in build > 20020129
imo the message should be more like:
No uncaught checked exceptions are thrown by the selected code.
No, since Surround with try/catch block also considers runtime exceptions if 
they are declared the the method signature. Extract method does the same
ok


surround try/catch: incorrect error message
