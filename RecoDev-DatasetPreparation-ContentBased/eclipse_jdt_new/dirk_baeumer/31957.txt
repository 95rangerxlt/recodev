When refactoring with "rename", the list of non-java files is remembered from 
use to use.  When using "move", the previous settings are ignored, and the 
last "rename" settings are used.

This is based on the M5 build.

When refactoring with "rename", the list of non-java files is remembered from

This is based on the M5 build.
The list of non Java resources is shared between rename and move on purpose. 
From a non Java file perspective the refactroings update fully qualified names.

What is the use case in which you want to have different list for move and 
rename ?
Sorry, incomplete explanation.  

Open the "rename" dialog and change the list.
Perform the action.
Open the "move" dialog and change the list.
Perform the action.
Open the "move" dialog again.
Note that the list is the list from "rename", and not from your previous "move".
Open the "rename" dialog again.
Note that the list is the list from the previous "rename", and not from "move".

The list from "move" is never saved.

Refactor/move doesn't remember non-java files
