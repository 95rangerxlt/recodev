I-20021016 linux-gtk:

public class Doo {
  private final static int MAGIC= compute();
  private final static int compute() {
    return 42;
  }
}

There are two issues:

1) If select the use of compute() is selected for inlining, then I get a 
message on the preview page that it's not possible to inline inside a field 
initializer. This is true in general, but in this particular case, it would be 
possible.

2) If I select the declaration of the method, I don't get any error on the
preview page. When I hit finish(), I will end up with a compile error, since
the method is simply removed.

Method invocation used as a field initializer are not inlined. In this case the 
method declaration will not be removed even if the user as requested to do so.


inline method - inline method breaks code when inlining into a field initializer [refactoring]
