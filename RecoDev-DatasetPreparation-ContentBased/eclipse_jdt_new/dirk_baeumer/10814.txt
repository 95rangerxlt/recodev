from the workbench build notes:

OpenNewPageMenu, OpenNewWindowMenu, and OpenPerspectiveMenu 
These IWorkbench methods, IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants constants, and 3 
classes have all been deprecated. Clients should use the new showPerspective 
methods on IWorkbench. See the ui mailing list for a more details about this 
new API and how clients are expected to use them.
