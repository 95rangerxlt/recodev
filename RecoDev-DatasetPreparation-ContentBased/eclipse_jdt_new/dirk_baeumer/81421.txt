Closing a project with open editors leaves stale elements in Package Explorer's
working sets mode.

This only affects CUs not normal resources.

Dani,

do you have more detailed steps. I can't reproduce it with a single editor where
the element is in the history list.
1. open a CU
2. change it don't save
3. open Navigator
4. close project of CU in Navigator
==> error happens whether you save or not and whether the CU is already in the
History working set

Fixed.
