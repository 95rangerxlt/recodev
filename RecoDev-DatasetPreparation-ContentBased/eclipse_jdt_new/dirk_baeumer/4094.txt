If my refactoring has a long name (e.g. long method name) then
	the Undo menu can get very long.

Problem still exists in build 20020214

The problem is that the stategy is hardcoded in SmartLabel and all places which 
use a comparable strategy. Since shortening a text has some NLS issues the 
platform should provide some support to do so. 
Fixed in build > I20020508
