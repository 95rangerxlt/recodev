Some menu feedback - I'd suggst to wait for additional feedback before starting 
to change the menus again.

The New menu currently only appears on containers. This good to keep the menus 
short, but I'm missing the New actoin on CUs or a Types. 
The scenarios that I have in mind:
* I'd like to be able to create a new class in the same package as the 
currently selected one.

* I'd like to create a new class when a type is selected (in this case the 
wizard takes the selection as the super class).

Add new menu for CUs and types. It is not present for fields, methods and 
imports.
