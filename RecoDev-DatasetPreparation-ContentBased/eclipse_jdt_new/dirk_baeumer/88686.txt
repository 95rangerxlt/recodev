Patch to JDT UI

Here's the patch. Please ignore the changes to the .project and launch
configuration.
Have to update the Javadoc for the refactoring processors as well.
Micahael,

two additional questions:

- according to the Javadoc I must assume that whenever the context is unkown I
  must assume a local context. So I have to check the context for 
  RemoteResourceMappingContext and if the context is different I return a 
  precise context. Right ?

- to do the right thing when the client calls accept on the traversal itself
  I implemented a special traversal by subclassing ResourceTraversal. Can you
  please explicitly state that subclassing ResourceTraversal is supported.
Subclassing ResourceTraversal has the other benifit that I don't have to
override the accept method on ResourceMapping. The default implementation will
do the right thing.
Fixed.
Dirk, your first point is correct.

John, do you have any objections to making ResourceTraversal sublcassable by 
clients. If not, can you please update the Javadoc.
John, the build already contains a subclass for ResourceTraversal. So if you
decide to not allow subclassing don't make the class final right now.
One step ahead of you.  In today's build, ResourceTraversal already explicitly
declares that clients may subclass it.
Great!
