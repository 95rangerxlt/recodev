When an internal JAR is shown in the package explorer it should be possible to 
append it to the build class path with an "Add to Build Path" action.

Thoughtworks feedback:
Adding a jar to the classpath is too laborious. Right click on the jar and "Add 
to build path" would be nice.

We had it for a long time, but it got lost in the menu reorganization
actually for symmetry reasons there should also be a way to remove a JAR from 
with the context menu.

Same for a source folder.

remove was there too - also got lost :)

see my old, old bug 5911 usability: adding/removing from classpath
see also another bug
Bug 30593 enhance 'add to build path' action to handle non-archives [build 
path] 

My fault. Reactivated the actions.
