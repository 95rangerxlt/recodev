space is inserted.

I have that problem too, but on Solaris with F1.
After changing the keystroke to Ctrl+F4 in the Plugin-Descriptor, everything was
fine. 
On Linux I had no problems.

The original description looks like a loss of the action accelerator. There 
used to be problems in this area which should have been solved with F1. This 
used to be workbench issue.

In the second case (F1), the changed accelerator works fine and it's a platform 
specific issue. This is more likely a SWT issue. Please file a separate 
platform specific PR.



Code assist somtimes doesn't show up with ctrl+space
