- click in a Java text pane to give it focus and to position the text cursor
- position your mouse cursor so that it is over a class name in the text editor
- hover help should appear with the class' Javadoc comment
- now press the right arrow on your keyboard
- the Javadoc will disappear, the text cursor will move, and then Javadoc will 
re-appear
- now try holding down the arrow key.  The Javadoc will flicker rapidly, and 
the cursor will slowly move across the screen

Suggestion: a keypress event should hide the hover help until a mouse move 
event is processed
