Linux-Motif

1. Open an editor with a few lines of text.
2. Make a change to the first line.
3. Place the cursor halfway through the last line.
4. Press ctrl+z to undo. Note that when the cursor is moved to the first line,
some highlighting is left on the last line (from the start of the line up to the
old cursor position).

Whenever the cursor changes lines, the last line indicator highlighting should
be completely removed.
