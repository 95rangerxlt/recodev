Build 20011206
To reproduce:

Start with java settings with the defaults

1) Change editor (Window->Preferences->Java->Editor settings) to use a
non-proportional font like Lucide Console
2) Uncheck "Code formatter->Style->Indentation is represented by a tab"  
3) start on a line ending with "{" and press enter to start a new line
4) enter a keyword like "if".
5) the keyword will jump an extra space.

NOTE: this won't happen if bold is turned off for keywords.

Seems related to insertion of blanks and the bold font.
