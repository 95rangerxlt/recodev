Currently this is the behavior:
> for Java Editor:
>     context menu: menu items are hidden or shown
>     Edit pull down menu : menu items are enabled or disabled
>
> for Outline view:
>     context menu: menu items are enabled or disabled
>     Edit pull down menu: menu items not related to context menu, and menu
> items are enabled or disabled
>
> What is the rulefor context menu items: hidden or disabled? 
> Are views and editors supposed to have different behaviors for context menus?
 
I think context menu item behavior should be implemented the same way accross 
views and editors using enabling and disabling.
>
> From what I call  tell,  there is also some unhealthy menu
duplication:
> pull down menu: Refactor/Modify method parameters ...
> and
> Outline view,class selected, context menu: Refactor >Modify parameters...
> The menu items being worded differently clearly shows that it is NOT the same 
menu resource being used ... any reason for that?

Erich,

   These are comments are specificaly about the java editor, refactor and 
outline contributions. 
Modify Parameters is now named consistently in the UI. 

Fixed for Open, Show, Source and Refactor actions in the editor context menu.

Moving to Kai for closing when editor context menu restructuring is finihed.
Done in F1.
