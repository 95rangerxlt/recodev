I am using build 20011120 with Sun JDK 1.4.0 Beta.

- Open a java file in a java editor
- somewhere inside a class, type a character
- OutOfMemoryError occurs.

Here is what happens:

WordRule.evaluate has a while loop that scans characters, and appends them to a 
buffer if they are a valid word part.  When the scanner reaches the end, it 
returns "-1".

The method that gets called is 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.JavaWordDetector, which calls 
Character.isJavaIdentifierPart.

On JDK 1.4.0, Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(-1) returns true!  This causes an 
infinite loop and eventual OutOfMemoryError.

I could not reproduce the behaviour on JDK 1.4.

Kai pls investigate whether the analyisis from John is correct.
