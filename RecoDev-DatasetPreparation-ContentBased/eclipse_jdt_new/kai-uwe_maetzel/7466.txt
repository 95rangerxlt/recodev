(This could be a JDT issue, but is a marker issue someplace).

Using the December 19, 2001 build.

Situation: A Java compile error produces a marker in the task list. The text 
shows up properly in the task list. In the Java editor window, a red X marker 
appears (properly)on the offending line. When the tool tip text shows up, the 
text in the tool tip is truncated at the first < (less than) symbol.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Code snippet with a bug.
Object[] myArray = new Object[]{"Hello"};
int myLength = 3;

//Next line produces a compile bug
if (myLength < myArray){ //OOPS! meant myArray.length
{
}

2) Save and compile the .java file.

3) Note that the marker text in the Tasks window reads:
The operator < is undefined for the argument type(s) int, java.lang.Object[]

4) Hover mouse pointer over the red marker x in the Java editor until tool tip 
shows up. Note that tool tip text reads: The operator

5) I also tested this in the initial shipping version of WSAD and the tool tip 
text worked properly, showing the entire string.

6) It seems to be < LT symbol. The tool tips show up fine on the > symbol and, 
most oddly, on the <= operator.
