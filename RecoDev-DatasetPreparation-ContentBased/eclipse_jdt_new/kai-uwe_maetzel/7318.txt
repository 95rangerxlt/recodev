I work with a variety of projects, and often each has slightly differing 
standards of tabbing.

Often, being able to specify that a TAB is actually represented as spaces and 
being able to state the amount of spaces it is, is extremely important.  This 
allows people to work with a variety of editors and each producing similiar 
formatted documents.

I see you can specify the auto indent to be tab or a space, and the amount.  
However I cannot see a way to specify that when I hit TAB that it is 
actually "x" amount of spaces.
