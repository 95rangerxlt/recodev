Build 20020423

1. Create the following cu in default package:
public class Test {
	Test f;
	public void foo(String s) {
		System.out.println("Hello Workd");
	}
}
2. Open it in the Java editor.
3. Show source of selected element only.
4. Select foo in Outline
5. Double-click on the left to add a breakpoint
Observe: The breakpoint icon doesn't appear.
6. Show complete source
Observe: The breakpoint icon appears.

I noticed that if I remove the field declaration 'Test f', then the breakpoint 
icon appears in the 'segmented view' mode.
