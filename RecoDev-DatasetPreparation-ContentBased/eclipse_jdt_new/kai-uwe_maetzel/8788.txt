Stable: 20020125

I keep the hierarchy view to the left of my editors.
I typically use it as a quick way to access a class/hierarchy and see what the 
kind of API it has.

However when I select on a method in the lower pane there is no quick/easy way 
to see either
  a- the return argument
  b- the java doc
The only way seems to be to double click on the method to edit the class. 
Unfortuantely this is distracting & then I have to remember to close the editor.

The reason I like teh hierarchy view is I can explore without losing my 
context. If there was a way to see a & b in the hierarchy view (I'm willing to 
accept any mechanism for showing it, a key, hover whatever). This would allow 
me more cases I don't have to lose context.

the loosing context point is very interesting
>a- the return argument
I just notice that we don't show the return argument in none of our views. We 
should add a preference whether the return value should be shown and add the 
support to our label provider.

>b- the java doc
we support F2 "quick" javadoc access in the editor. It would be consistent to 
support F2 in all of our views (we are already doing the same with F4). This 
would also be useful in the packages view on the members shown there.

An alternative is to have a small javadoc area at the bottom of the methods 
pane. However, it would likely be too small to be useful.
a - I personally would not turn this one because it just gets in the way and 
most of the panes are narrow, so horizontal space is a premium.

b - F2 sounds good
  - agree area at bottom of methods pane probably not helpful 


note that the status line names the return type of the currently selected method
Correct. 
I didn't notice the return type until you pointed it out because I'm used to 
seeing it on the left and its kind of sandwiched in the middle:

java.lang.Number.doubleValue(): double - c:\jdk1.3\jre\lib\rt.jar

Thanks for the pointer.
Discussed with Kai about the F2 support in the tree views. He is positive that 
the existing pop-up shell infrastructure for text can be leveraged for the tree 
as well.

Moving to Kai for further investigation.
you can now press F1 on any java element and you get the first sentence from 
the javadoc.


hierarchy view could show mor info about methods
