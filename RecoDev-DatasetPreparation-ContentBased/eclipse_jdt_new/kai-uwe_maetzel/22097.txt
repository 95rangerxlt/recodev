Why not enhance the "F2" shortcut to display the content of the hover help if 
there is no external JavaDoc available?

This sounds like a bug to me. Shouldn't F2 be at least as informative as
hover help, if not more so?

This is particularly important for users who turn hover help off. When it's 
disabled, there's no way to find the information which is otherwise available 
via hover help.
F2 shows exactly the same information as hover help. If you want to see 
external Javadoc you have to use Shift+F2. Peter, do you have an example where 
F2 is less informative than hover help.
I can reproduce it with this simple class. Hover works, but F2 only works if 
the file is writable (not read only).

Similar problem if the file was read only changed to writable when starting 
editing (checked out automaticly by the editor). You have to close the file and 
reopen it.

When I created the test class F2 and Hover Help didn't work until I closed the 
file and reopend it (save with auto build didn't succeed).

        myMap.containsKey(new Object());
	}
    
	/**
	 * Method someMethod.
	 * @param someObject
	 * @return String

    protected String someMethod(Object someObject)
    {
        if( !myMap.containsKey(someObject.getClass()) )
        {
            return "string2";
        }
        return "string1";
    }

}

The read-only case is releated to bug 20346
Build > 20020904.
which branch? 2.1 or 2.0.2?


F2 should be at least as informativ as hover help [editor]
