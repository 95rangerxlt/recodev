Type the following line in a java editor

sadfsdfsdf"sdfhsdlkfhskjfd

At this point, the characters to the right hand side of the quote character are 
highlighted in blue (to indicate a string literal).  This is fine.  Now, add a 
quote character to the beginning of the line:

"sadfsdfsdf"sdfhsdlkfhskjfd

Now only the string literal should be highlighted, but in fact the entire line 
is still indicated as being a string literal (in blue).

Another example.  Start with:

new String[] {hello", "world", "foo", "bar"};

Then add the missing " character at the beginning of hello.  The rest of the 
line remains incorrectly higlighted, even if you continue to add things at the 
end of the list.  You have to go back and somehow edit the other string literals 
to force them to correct their highlighting.
