There are problems because the linking is done on keystroke:
- it does not work for read-only and class files
- while typing (e.g. in A.java) the views are in synch but when I then switch to
another editor point the cursor somewhere then the Outline view is not synched.
From other "Link X to Y" preferences I would expect the caret to be synched with
the Outline view and not the (last) modify position.

there is the option to link on cursor move and this is the one I'd opt for.
No action for 2.0
This has been fixed long ago.
