Build 04182002

0. Close all open editors.
1. Import org.eclipse.jdt.debug as plugin.  Setup the workspace so that there 
are no compile errors.
2. Go to a Java Perspective.
3. Navigate-->Open Type-->ASTInstructionCompiler.
4. Grab the vertical scrollbar thumb and drag it down at a moderate speed.  It 
is very slow and gets "backed up".  When you let go of the thumb, scrolling 
continues for some time.
5. Close ASTInstructionCompiler editor.
6. Go to the Packages page.
7. Open ASTInstructionCompiler file by double clicking on it in the Packages 
View.  
8. Drag scroll as in Step 4.  It is many orders of magnitude faster.

Note that this is on Linux.  The behavior is not as noticeable on my fast Win2K 
machine (a little hesistation here and there).  Either way, it seems incorrect 
that scrolling is so affected by whether or not the file is opened in the 
Hierarchy View.

Also note that if you first open the file in the Packages View and then go to 
the Hierarchy View, scrolling does not slow down.

There is no relation between scrolling in the editor and the hierarchy view. 
The hierarchy view does not receive any event when the editor is scrolled. 
(Debugged on Win2K.) Build 20020430 contains changes that will speed up 
scrolling performance.
This behavior was seen on Linux and was related to the blocked PR above.  Both 
Jared and I were able to reproduce the problem.  I guess we will try again with 
the new build.  Maybe it's JDT related.  Did you try the scenario at all on 
Linux?  It's a pretty dramatic difference if you open a *.java file in the 
packages view vs. using Open Type.
works for me in 20020501.

There was a performance issue in rendering the DefaultRangeIndicator, which
has been fixed. The difference between using OpenType and PackageViewer for
opening is the initial selection. When OpenType is used, the whole type is 
selected, yielding a big 'magnet'.
