- enter the following code
package org.eclipse.test;

import java.awt.event.FocusEvent;

public class A {
	public void foo() {
		FocusEvent event= null;
	}
}

- position the cursor inside Focus{cursor}Event
- move the I beam to the left. But it must still be over FocusEvent
- wait until JavaDoc hover pops up
- press F2
observe: there are two hovers
- now move the I beam out of FocusEvent
- one hover gets closed
- move the I beam back
- a second hover appears.
