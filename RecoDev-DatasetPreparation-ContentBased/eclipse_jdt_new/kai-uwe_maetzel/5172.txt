Keywords appear in bold.

Coding is typically done in a fixed width font so that everything lines up.
Introducing bolding keywords defeats this.

Also, if you change the color for the keywords, the bolding is removed but this 
only lasts for the current session - bolding reappears when you exit Eclipse 
and then re-start it.

Not to mention that bolding tends to emphasize the keywords when, in fact, I 
find the keywords the least interesting part of the code.  The conditions after 
the keywords are often what is important.

I second (third?) the request to make this configurable, I find bold keywords 
very distracting and cluttered.

DCR need to be able to turn off bold keywords
