Due to changing the matching parenthesis to bold font, it is causing the code in 
between brackets to be shifted back and forth when using a proportional font.

I find it painfull, and would prefer if the highlighting was instead using a 
different color rather than a different style.

I've found this a bit annoying too, but I love the feature!  It would be better 
if it toggled less often, as this is what causes the source to wiggle back and 
forth.  For example, the following things cause the matching to toggle on and 
off unnecessarily:

- depressing and releasing left mouse button
- depressing and releasing Control or Shift
- moving the cursor from before the bracket to after the bracket.
The boldening isn't as easy to spot and results in the flickering with 
proportional fonts as reported.
We experiment with toggling the background color.
