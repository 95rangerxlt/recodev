1) compile the statement new StringBufferInputStream(123)
		(It should result in an error and a deprecated warning)
	Observe: the warning icon is on top of the error icon. 
	2) hover over the warning icon
	Observe: the hover shows the error message, not the warning.

	BTW: I could not always reproduce this problem, that is sometimes the error was on top of the warning.
	However this non-determinism seems to be a problem too.

NOTES:
EG (10/1/2001 12:18:50 AM)
	the hover could list all the messages from the overlapping markers, eg
	<problem icon> message
	<warning icon> message
	<task icon> message

	This doesn't address: 1GKLS0J: ITPJUI:WIN2000 - error hover not shown if search marker in the same line

moved to 'active'
PRODUCT VERSION:
	0.136


In 20020214 the hover shows all warnings and errors, however a warning icon can 
still cover an error icon.
I think errors should always stay on top.
fixed in the latest error appears now on top of error


Warning icon hides error icon in vertical ruler (1GKNNB3)
