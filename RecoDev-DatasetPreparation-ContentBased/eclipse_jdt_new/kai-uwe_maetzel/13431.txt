build 20020409

I've opened the file org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.java from the project version 
v1_0_138 of org.eclipse.swt (in dev.eclipse.org). When I select a type name 
(e.g., Image) and press F4 I get an internal error with the attached log entry.
This seems to happen with every Java file opened from a project version.

This bug is caused by using the JavaEditor for versions from the repository.
This is new behaviour.

Notice in this scenario the JavaEditor is used on a StorageEditorInput created 
from a non-Java resource, i.e., a version from the repository.


It might be tight to get these fixed for M5 but we should investigate.

You could just change it to open a regular editor by default for M5. 
The syntax highlighting was weird anyway (only the keywords had highlighting) 
so I don't think the Java editor adds much value for opening files from the 
repository.
VCM will back out this feature for M5. We will reinvestigate for M6.
Actions are disabled since F1/F2.
