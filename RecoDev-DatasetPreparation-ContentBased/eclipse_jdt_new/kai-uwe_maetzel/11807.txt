The problem exists for current line highlighting as well.
also, if the Java editor font size was changed, the margin isn't in the correct 
location until the active editor page is closed and re-opened, or the margin 
preference is deselected, applied, reselected, and applied twice.

The first issue is solved. The second covered by #17604.
