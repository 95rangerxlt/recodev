Problem was found in Eclipse R2, build 20020214.
 Java editor:  bad display of adjacent Hebrew or Arabic syntactic 
units

On an empty line, type    string s = "ABC" + "DEF";  // THIS IS A COMMENT
This should display as   string s = "CBA" + "FED";  // TNEMMOC A SI SIHT
Instead, it is displayed as   string s = "TNEMMOC A SI SIHT //  ;"FED" + "CBA

Note that this is an old bug which was fixed a long time ago by Steve Northover. 
 The bug does not appear in Eclipse-SDK-SHIPPED-R1.0, build 0.137, but it does 
appear in R2.0 build 20020214.

This bug is not yet fixed in build M5 (20020416).
The 1.0 workaround had to be taken out for 2.0. It was based on the assigned 
syntax colors and in 2.0 these colors are customizable. 

SWT is now providing BidiSegmentListener support that we should leverage in the 
Java editor.
There has been a bug in the compilation unit editor which overrode a method 
disabling the BidiSegmentListener installed in its super class.
Fixed, build > 20020423.
Tested on Arabic windows 2000 system on build 2002/04/26, it is fixed.
Tested on Hebrew Windows 2000 system on build 2002/04/25, it is fixed.  
However, the same bug appears when editing a Scrapbook page.  I have opened bug 
14386 to track the Scrapbook bug.

Sorry, finger check on my previous comment: the Scrapbook bug is 14836.
