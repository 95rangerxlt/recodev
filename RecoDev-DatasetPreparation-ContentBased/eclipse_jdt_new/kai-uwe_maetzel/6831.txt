build 20011211 - linux/motif - Mandrake 8.2 - Gnome 1.4

Using the options "Show source of selected element only", the outline is not
always updating correctly when selecting methods. I see the complete source
instead of the method I'm selecting. I've faced many times but do not have
reproducible steps yet.

we need reproducable steps on windows to show that it is a JDT and not an SWT 
event problem. 
I haven't seen this problem on Windows and have not been working on Linux 
latelly to say if it has been happening or not.
Closed as no reproducible case and no comparable PRs since this one has been 
logged.
