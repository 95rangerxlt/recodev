Title: Line has to be selected from beginning when using the 'Tab' key.

Description:

A line of text has to be selected from the beginning in the Java editor in
order to use the 'Tab' key. If it is not, the line of text will be erased
instead of the line being tabbed in one more time.


Steps to reproduce problem:

1. Create a Java project.

2. Create a package in the project from ' step 1'.

3. Create a Java class in the package from 'step 2'.

4. Add the following line of code to the class from 'step 3' with two 
tabs ahead of it:

System.out.println ("Hello");

5. Highlight the line from '4' before the first tab and the press the 'Tab'
key, the line will be tabbed in one more time. However, if you highlight
the line starting between the first tab and the second tab, and then press
the 'Tab' key the line will be erased.

Opinion is that 'Tab' key should work when a partial line is highlighted.

Workaround:

Select line from beginning.

this is the designed behaviour
Customer wants to understand why this behaviour is working as designed. Why did 
we do it this way?
Reworked tab handling. Build M5.
0530 Integration build, Windows 2000

1. Copy this code into a class:
public class TestClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println ("Hello");		
		System.out.println ("Hello");		
	}
}

2. Highlight all but the first tab in the first System.out line plus highlight 
the entire second System.out line. 
3. Press tab, which indents both lines with another tab. If only the first line 
is highlighted (don't highlight the first tab), the line is deleted.

This seems to be inconsistent behavior.
Slight twist to the test case. If you don't highlight the second System.out 
line but just have the cursor sitting at the beginning of the 2nd line (while 
highlighting the first System.out), only the first System.out line is indented. 
Check behavior of F2. No further action for 2.0
