In the Java editor,  some of the shortcut keys for the context menus (sorry, don't
	know the proper names) are shared by multiple entries.

	C - copy, comment
	T - cut, uncomment
	S - save, search

NOTES:
Fixed 'C' and 'T'.
Use 'A' for search but not happy with it. Dani pls. check.
Meant 'e' for search. This overlaps with the debugger's inspect action but is 
far less often used than Save.
Checked. Also changed the mnemonic for the global Search action to 'e'.
