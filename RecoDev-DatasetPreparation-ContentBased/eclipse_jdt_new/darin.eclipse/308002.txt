Build Identifier: M20090211-1700

The
org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.LaunchConfigurationManager.isSharedConfig(Object
receiver) method identifies shared configuration by checking whether the object
is an instance of IFile.

Our custom view handles custom objects that are adaptable to IFile. But as
those are not directly IFile instances, objects representing launch
configurations are not properly detected as such. Thus the corresponding launch
configuration is not displayed as expected in the 'Run/Debug As' submenu when
right clicking on those objects.

Having the LaunchConfigurationManager.isSharedConfig() method also checking for
object adaptable to IFile would enable us to handle launch configuration in our
view as expected.


Reproducible: Always

Created attachment 163897
patch
Released to HEAD. Fixed.

If the bug reporter could verify the fix, it would be helpfull (since we don't have your view to test with).
Thanks for the fast reactivity.
I'll try the patch asap, but this might take a while as I don't have the proper development environment configured yet.


LaunchConfigurationManager.isSharedConfig(Object receiver) too restrictive when identifying launch configurations
