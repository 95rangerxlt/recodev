It would be nice to be specify something like ${ee_home:J2SE-1.4} in a launch configuration and have that replaced with the JRE home for the corresponding EE according to the installed JRE preferences.

Which fields/attributes do you want to be able to specify this in?
My initial though was for program arguments and vm arguments. 

 I was setting up an antRunner launch config and wanted to pass -D arguments.
Moving to JDT debug. Debug provides the UI blocks and resolution of the program/VM arguments.
