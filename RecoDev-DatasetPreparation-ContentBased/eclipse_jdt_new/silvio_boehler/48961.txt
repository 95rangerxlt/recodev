In Eclipse prefs and wizards the style is to show a status when wrong data is
entered. The new code formatter pref fields don't do so but directly modify the

It is also not intuitive which default is applied:

When entering -1 it sometime gets replaced by 0 and sometimes by 1 (even though
0 would be a valid value as well)
Agree, we should do the following:

- show an status when an invalid value get entered
- disable the OK button.
