Programmers working for different customers have the need to adjust their 
formatting options of the code formatter to the needs of the customer. If I have 
projects for different customers inside of my workspace this means I need to 
type in all that formatting options each time I switch the current project. This 
is boring. Would be great if...
a) I could enable Eclipse to save code comment templates and formatting options 
in the project rather than the workspace.
b) I could save and load code comment templates and formating options into a 
file on disk so I can copy and apply them from one project to the next.

Martin, is this something for the new coop ?
for the new code formatter preference page we will look into profiles.
The new preference page supports this, starting with I20031202 (enable the new
formatter on the "Work in progress" page).


Would be great to save formatting options in a file [code manipulation] [formatter]
