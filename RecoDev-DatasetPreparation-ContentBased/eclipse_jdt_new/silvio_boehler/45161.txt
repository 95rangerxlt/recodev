Right now if you change a formatter setting, the editor preview pane moves and 
scrolls, sometimes quite a bit. Instead it should remember the scroll position 
in relation to the file (ie the content of the line the cursor is on) and 
attempt to maintain the position. This would make it much easier to see the 
impact of the editor changes.

Move to JDT/UI.
Martin, should be considered by the new preference page.
Fixed with the new formatter preference page (enable "Use new formatter" in Java
-> Work in progress), starting from I20031202.
