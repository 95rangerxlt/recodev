build i0128, winxp, j9sc20031212

I have 
  White Space -> Arrays -> Array element access -> after opening bracket
not checked in my formatter preferences and it still is adding a space. Although
the preview in the preference page looks ok.
  e.g.  foobar[ result.size()];
               ^

Notes:
- toggling the preference has no effect
- this only happens in one of my workspaces
- formatter settings are modified from Basic
- in the workspace that it does work ok, I think that its modified from Java
defaults
- nothing in the log file

Silvio, could you please investigate the changes of settings regarding this option?
Thanks.
Update title.
The problem only occurs for array allocation expression. The default value for
the Java conventions was wrong for the white space after the opening bracket.
This is fixed in bug 50719.
As long as the UI is not showing this settings, its value cannot be changed.
fixed > 20040129

Added the bracket settings for array allocations on the new white space page
