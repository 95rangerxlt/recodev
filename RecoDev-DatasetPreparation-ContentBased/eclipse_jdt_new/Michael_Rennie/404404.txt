The 'step into selection' action lives in a different menu to the 'step into' action in the 'run' menu. This makes it difficult to discover for those are looking in the same place as 'step into'.

On my Windows 7 machine using 4.3 M6 they are both in the same menu, and even in the same group. Or, did you just mean, it should be just next to 'Step Into'? I would agree with that.
The menu item was moved to the step group in part of bug 206797 (so you'll need at least 4.3M5). I moved the action to be part of the stepIntoGroup (appears with the Step Into command in the run menu).


Move 'step into selection' into the same part of the menu as 'step into'
