proposed fix

Version: 3.7.0
Build id: I20110307-2110 (and all versions since heap-walking was added)

In its current state, the method HeapWalkingManager#supportsHeapWalking only considers if the supplied object is an instance of IJavaDebugTarget. If the given object is not an instance of IJavaDebugTarget we should ask it for an IJavaDebugTarget adapter, allowing other debug targets to take part in heap-walking.
