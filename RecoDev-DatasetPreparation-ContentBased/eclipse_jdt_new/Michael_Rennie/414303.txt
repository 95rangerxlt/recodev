They DNF because they reach the time out. Take a look at [1] to see what was on the screen when the time out was hit. See also the console log [2] for more details when the time out was reached (e.g. stack traces).

The Ant tests DNFed again in I20130805-2000 on Linux.
I haven't been able to reproduce any of these failures locally, but the fix for bug 414516 might help, as I noticed in the Windows logs there were a tonne of entries about the connection being reset
The windows console log also had this entry:

java.lang.Exception: Thread-188
     [java] 	at org.eclipse.ui.console.IOConsoleOutputStream.close(IOConsoleOutputStream.java:167)
     [java] 	at org.eclipse.ui.console.IOConsole.dispose(IOConsole.java:273)
     [java] 	at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.views.console.ProcessConsole.dispose(ProcessConsole.java:354)
     [java] 	at org.eclipse.ui.console.AbstractConsole.destroy(AbstractConsole.java:289)

which might mean it is blocked while trying to close the console / stream. I did make a change here in bug 352626 to add some more sync'ing to try and eliminate some of those spurious "stream closed" entries in the console.

Remove the sync'ing with: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.debug.git/commit/?id=58f247e9a0bac266421e37fbd777fff89b8da182

lets see if that was the cause.
The tests passed on Linux and Mac. The Windows machine has a general problem in the latest build (see 414551).

This was a temporary issue: the Windows tests are also green!
I am going to mark this fixed for M1.
