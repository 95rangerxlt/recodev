The JDT debugger has the ability to show monitors owned by a thread.  this is turned off by default.  Dunno how long this option has been here but many people (including me) never knew it was there and would have greatly benefitted from its use in time-consuming race and deadlock debugging sessions.

Please consider turning it on by default.

I agree this would be a better default.
I also agree.

We'll change it at the start of 3.8, I don't think its a good idea to change a default setting at the end of a release.

+1
Not sure why this is bad to change now.  consider it a polish item.  Presumably the function is stable as it is in the release so the risk is minimal.  What is going to change between now and 3.8 wrt this function?

We want to avoid prominent changes to the UI so late in the game (M7/RC0 is next week). Also note that this is in the 'Tips and Tricks' (maybe time to read it [again]? ;-).
3.8 suits me, thanks
Done.
