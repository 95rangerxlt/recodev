Build ID: M20080221-1800

Steps To Reproduce:
In WebLogic Server Tools plugin, we 
create a new JRE when user creates a new WLS Server Runtime
in the WTP "Server" Preference Page.

The code to create JRE looks like: 
 final VMStandin vmWorkingCopy = new VMStandin( type, vmId );
 vmWorkingCopy.setName( vmId );
 vmWorkingCopy.setInstallLocation( vmLocation );
 vm = vmWorkingCopy.convertToRealVM();
 JavaRuntime.saveVMConfiguration(); 

The last call persists the change to Preference store.

If user immediately switch to Installed JRE page,
the new JRE does not show up. Even worse is that
if user closes the Preference now, the change is overridden.


More information:
If user creates the WebLogic server runtime outside of the Preference, 
the JRE is picked up next time user

Most likely a duplicate of bug 121057.
This bug is slightly different - in bug 121057, the user has created an installed JRE from the pref page, which is not available on the EE page. This problem is the programmatic addition of an installed JRE is not picked up by the already open JRE pref page.

Curtis could you review?

I intentionally do not allow VM installs to be edited or removed via another page, as they should involve user interaction. Also there is a caveat - if you add an install from another page, then remove it from the Installed JREs page, and then try to add the same one again (from another page) it will not work. This is becaiuse the backing list still thinks the VM is there - the same underlying problem why we cannot see new VM installs in EE pref page; they have not been committed yet.
