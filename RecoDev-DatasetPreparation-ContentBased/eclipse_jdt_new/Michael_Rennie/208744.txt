Steps To Reproduce:
1. Copy the code below
2. Reads the comments to know where to put watchpoints
3. Watchpoints are not set, instead a breakpoint is set for
the next "valid" line (which is dumb i think)


public class Watchpoint {
	double a, b; // unable to set a watchpoint on this line
	
	double c, // unable to set a watchpoint on this line or the next one
	d;
	
	void foo() {
		
	} // for somme unknow reason, this line gets "invalid" watchpoints as breakpoints
}

Workaround:
split the declaration, of 2 fields as 2 different line, and then add the watchpoints.

Workaround is to toggle watchpoints in the editor outline.

fix

the problem was that our breakpoint location verifier was short-cutting to not process a VariableDeclarationFragment if it had no initializer when there was more than one fragment for a given FieldDeclaration.
applied patch to HEAD, please verify Darin W
