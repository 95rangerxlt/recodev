Patch looks good. Released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=446bb541ca213992576e03757eea7f75301ac1be

Before we resolve this, a couple of things need addressing.

(1) Per my reading the enum valueOf method must have a mandated parameter
by name 'name' - this is presently missing.

(2) Let us also add a couple more tests with deeper levels of inner class
nesting and capture of outer locals from different contexts.

Thanks!

Good catch!

Yes, but there's a a snag: See bug 415019 - there's some inconsistency with javac regarding local classes.
Via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=5a2c180a837c1c434b2700b180ba498a761566e7, I released some
more tests.

Please note that some of the tests are disabled because of known bugs
in ECJ and will have to enabled once fixes are available. A couple of
tests are disabled on account of spec wording confusion. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=415019#c5
Removing review flag since patch has already been reviewed by Srikanth
Released fixes for the issue with enum's valueOf and private nested classes's constructors.

Here it is:

Issue with anonymous classes under local classes still not resolved.
Released the fix for the remaining cases, via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=dadef2fc0573a510ff313dd625ee1ba4e2b2e6e3
