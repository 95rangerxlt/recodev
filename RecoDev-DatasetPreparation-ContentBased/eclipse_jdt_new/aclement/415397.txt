BETA_JAVA8: 

From the spec: 

"An annotation on a wildcard type argument appears before the wildcard, as in 
MyClass<@Immutable ? extends Comparable<MyClass>>"

However, when the following program is compiled, the annotations are
accepted, but don't seem to make it to the class file:

// ---
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;
import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.*; 
@Target(TYPE_USE)
@interface Immutable {}
class X {
	List<@Immutable ? extends Comparable<X>> x;
}

// ----

javac 8b100 emits:

RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations:
      0: #9(): FIELD, location=[TYPE_ARGUMENT(0)]

Andy, if you don't expect to get to this in the next 2-3 weeks, let me know.
I'll reassign. TIA.

Test and fix.

Might be easier to apply after the patch attached to bug 415543

Patch looks good. Thanks. For good measure I also updated
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.Wildcard.traverse(ASTVisitor, ClassScope)
though I couldn't with minimal effort construct a test case that would prove
the need for this change.
