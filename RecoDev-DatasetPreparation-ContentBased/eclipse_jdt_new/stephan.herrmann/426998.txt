This seems like a very recent regression. This code no longer compiles:

		public class Snippet {
			static void call(Class type, long init) {
				String string = new String();
				method(type, init == 0 ? new String() : string);
			}
			private static void method(Class type, String s) {}
		}

The error is:
The method method(java.lang.Class, java.lang.String) in the type Snippet is not applicable for the arguments (java.lang.Class, java.lang.String)

The code is narrowed down from JNA source code project that has been sitting open in my workspace for some time. Originally the two methods were named the same, but this was required to cause the error. The cause might be the fix to bug 426764 in which case feel free to mark as duplicate.

This and the snippet mentioned in bug 426764 comment 5 are both broken since the fix for bug 426590.
A typo, indeed, in the fix for bug 426590.
