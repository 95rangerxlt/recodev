The following code generates wrong code:

interface I {
    public void foo() default {
        System.out.println("default");
    }
}
public class C implements I {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C c = new C();
        c.foo();
    }
}

At runtime this produces:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.Object.foo()V
	at C.foo(C.java:1)
	at C.main(C.java:9)

The reason is in the way a synthetic method (SuperMethodAccess) for foo is generated: it is assumed that the super method must be in accessMethod.declaringClass.superclass(), which leads to trying to invoke java.lang.Object.foo(), which obviously doesn't exist.

Created attachment 227029
tentative fix

This patch fixes the immediate issue but is not sufficiently tested.
Jay, does my patch help for your test re static methods in interfaces?
Should I test and release this one first, or wait for you?
If released the immediate patch via commit c22ae4e2acd996824ff94a2b0edaa0df69d9b3b1

Further cross-checking deferred to bug 391376.

Yes, Stephan. Thank you!
