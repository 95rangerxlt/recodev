Trying to find the token and sourcePosition that correspond to QNR#binding I wanted to use QNR#indexOfFirstFieldBinding but observed that this field is reassigned for *every* field in the chain.

So either the name or the usage of this field is wrong.

In bug 392384 I'm temporarily adding another field indexOfFirstFirstFieldBinding so I can test that errors are reported at the desired location. That change may need to be reverted via this bug.

I'll address this after bug 392384.
The semantics of this field is "indexOfCurrentFieldBinding".
The implementation must not be changed, but the name should be.

I'll take this over to BETA_JAVA8, because only there I needed a field
with actual semantics of "indexOfFirstFieldBinding".
After much back-and-forth I understood:
- ProblemReporter has useful methods nodeSourceStart/End() for similar situations,
  which, however, cannot distinguish segments in "o.other.other"
- the problems with #indexOfFirstFieldBinding are twofold:
  - this index is 1-based!!
  - it only matches its name after it has walked through possible positions
    during BlockScope.getBinding(..)
  I added comments about these findings to the field declaration

The original problem in NullTypeAnnotationTest was resolved by fixing index arithmetics.
