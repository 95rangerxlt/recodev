I20050928-1300

The fix for bug 100555 introduced this new problem:

public class Try {
    public static class MoveToNewFile {
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        private String a;
        public String getA() {
            return a;
        }
    }
    
    Object tryA= new MoveToNewFile().a;
}

'Move Member Type to New File' does not make the private field 'a' visible and
therefore leads to a compile error. It is bad style to access private members of
nested classes, but JLS3 ยง6.6.1 allows access from within the body of the top
level class.

patch for jdt.ui and jdt.ui.tests.refactoring
Defer this patch. There is another issue associated with this bug. When moving
static types, the same issue appears with private, default or protected members
inside the static moved type.

Investigating...
Test case for move static members: Two classes in the same package:

----
public class A {

  static class Inner {
     String a;
  }
}

public class B {

 Object o= new A.Inner().a;
}
---

Move Inner into a class in a different package. Both the class Inner and the
field a should have their visibility adjusted.

-> have to provide visibility adjustments for members of moved types.

patch for jdt.ui and jdt.ui.tests.refactoring

Fixes adjusting the visibility of moved element and the visibility of members
of moved element.

Also fixes adjusting the visibility of parents of elements called from within
moved element (bug 115633).
