*** Bug 39947 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Instanceof references are currently updated regardless of whether the guarded
cast can also be updated. In the following example, the instanceof-type is
replaced, which is wrong.

Same problem when extracting interface IBee from B with 'Change references...'
checked and member 'beeOnly()' NOT checked. 


class A { }

class B extends A { // use supertype 'A' for 'B' where possible
	public void beeOnly() {}
}

class User {
	void use(A a) {
		if (a instanceof B) { // 'B' wrongly replaced by 'A'
			B b= (B) a;
			b.beeOnly();
		}
	}
}
