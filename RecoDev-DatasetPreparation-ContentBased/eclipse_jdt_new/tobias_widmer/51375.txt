public class A {
	public void c() {} //cool!
}

- Extract interface I
- The result:
public interface I {
void c() {} //coo;}
... is not correct.

Just adding a .append(getLineSeperator()) in createInterfaceSource(..) doesn't
work since the superfluous line break stays there after code formatting even in
normal cases. -> Should use ASTRewrite for all code manipulations...
