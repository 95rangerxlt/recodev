Please add a new option to add empty lines around <ul> and <li> lines. See 
example below.

/**
 * <p>The header grid has the following characteristics:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>It has two levels: one for the hierarchy level and one for the 
attribute.
 * 
 * <li>It allows for resizing and draging of the headers
 * 
 * <li>It allows for editing of the header names (with direct consequence on
 * the hierarchy levels and attributes).
 * 
 * <li>It uses icons for the attributes to show the type, any sorting and any 
filtering.
 * 
 * </ul> 
 * 
 * <p>Note that the class does not enherit from {@link 
com.eliad.swing.extend.JAdvancedGridHeader}
 * because this later class is <code>final</code>.
