Adapted tests to exclude the generated id from comparison.
(Three different compilers (Sun 1.5, IBM 1.4.2, JDT Core I20041117) along with 
the corresponding Sun/IBM JDK yielded three different IDs!).
Investigating further...
The ids seem compiler-dependent. Closing since the test cases should test the 
correct generation of the field only.
