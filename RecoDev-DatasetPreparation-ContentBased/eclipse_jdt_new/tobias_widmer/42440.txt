Markus, can you please investigate why this is the case. Please contact me 
before fixing.
Bug 23699 already mentions the limitation. The blocking jcore bug there has been
fixed, but it wasn't the only problem.

Extracting interfaces from inner classes is currently disabled because there are
problems with updating references.

Only the first part of ExtractInterfaceRefactoring (extracting interface and
adding "implements ...") has been rewritten for ASTRewrite. References are still
updated by "manual" text edits (also in the helper class ExtractInterfaceUtil),
and they don't seem to work with the necessary qualifications for inner types.
Fixed > 20050323 (new typeconstraint infrastructure)


"Extract Interface" is not available on a nest static class [refactoring]
