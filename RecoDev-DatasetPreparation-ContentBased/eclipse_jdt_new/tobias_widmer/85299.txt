Copying and moving enum constants (IFields, e.g. in the Outline) does not work.
The problem is that clients of
  ASTNodeSearchUtil.getFieldDeclarationNode(IField, CompilationUnit) and
  ASTNodeSearchUtil.getFieldDeclarationFragmentNode(IField, CompilationUnit)
assume they get a field that is not an enum constant.

Enum constants map to EnumConstantDeclaration AST nodes, and clients need to
either handle them separately or else ensure they only work with non-enum fields.

The clients in ReorgPolicyFactory and TypedSource need to be updated.
