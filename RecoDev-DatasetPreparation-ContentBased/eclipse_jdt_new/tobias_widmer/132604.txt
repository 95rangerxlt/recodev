observe: Finish button is disabled and there is no way to enable it again.
There is a way: Just uncheck the "Export refactorings..." preference.

This behavior has been introduce that a user cannot inadvertedly press finish after having enabled the "Export refactorings..." preference without selecting the refactorings to export. All exportable refactorings are unchecked per default.
If there are no nrefactoring avaiable, the 'export refactorings button' should better be grayed out, and not selected by default.
We do not yet know on the first page of the wizard whether any refactorings can be exported. This depends on the selections on the first and second wizard page of the JAR Export Wizard.
The Jar Export Wizard UI will be redesigned to have no additional refactoring wizard pages, but rather a dialog to select the refactorings to export.
The JAR Export wizard UI has been redesigned and does not contain any additional wizard pages anymore.
