create the folloing classes:
---
package a.b.c.d;

public class JavaEditorTests extends TestCase {
}
---
package a.b.c.d;

public class PropertiesEditorTests extends TestCase {

}
----
package a.b.c.d;

public class TestCase {

}

- open refactoring menu on 'JavaEditorTests'. Create superclass is not available.
- add a method to 'JavaEditorTests'
  now 'extract superclass' is available

I think methods shouldn't be required for this refactoring

Note that it is required to change the selection in the package explorer. Some state seems to be cached.
