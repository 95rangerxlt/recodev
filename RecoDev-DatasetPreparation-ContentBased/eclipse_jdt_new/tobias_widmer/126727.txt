I've been cleanup up the IDiffTree API and it turns out that the accept method and the IDiffTreeVisitor do not need to throw CoreException so I would like to remove them.The problem is that two classes in JDT and LTK declare and handle the exception so we need to coordinate the removal of the change. This can be done at any time that is convenient for tyou but must be in for M5.

I've removed our throws clauses from IDiffTreevisitor#visit since no CoreExceptions where thrown anyway.
I suggest to do the removal of the accept(..) CoreException on Friday for the M5 warm-up.
Sounds good. Ping me on Friday to coordinate the change.
