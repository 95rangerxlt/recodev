Definitelly something we should look into for 3.1. We have to check if we need 
AST here anymore since the Java model now provides elements for local and 
anonymous types as well.
Tobias, can you please investigate.
We still need AST's to find out about field declaration fragments. Changed 
implementation to use one shared and lazily created AST per compilation unit.

TypedSource should not build ASTs per copied element
