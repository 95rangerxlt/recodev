I've added methods to ISynchronizationCompareAdapter to save and restore a set of input mappings that have been synchronized. I'd like to make them abstract so that clients will provide appropriate implementations but I need to add the methods to the JDT subclasses first. I will attach a patch that provides stub methods.
