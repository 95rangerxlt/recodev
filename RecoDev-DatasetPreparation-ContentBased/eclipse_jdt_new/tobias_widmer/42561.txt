After enabling "Enable formatting of Javadoc..." in the "Work in Progress"
settings under "Java" in the preferences dialog, I formatted a class. The
formatter removed the single-line space between the last import statement and
the top of my class's Javadoc. Putting the space back and reformatting caused
the same result. Turning off "Enable formatting of Javadoc...", putting the
space back, and reformatting left it intact.

It should leave the space there.

Tobias, please check whether this is already covered by fixing the other comment
formatter related bugs.

Charles, please note that it is still work in progress.

Verified. The new content formatter now formats comment partitions after a 
pass with the Core code formatter.
