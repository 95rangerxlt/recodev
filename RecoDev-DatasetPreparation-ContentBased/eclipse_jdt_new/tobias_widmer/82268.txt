JUnit View: Scroll Lock does not lock list in Failure tab. Only locks Hierarchy.
Dirk,

Another inconsistency.  Everywhere that HierarchyTab calls showItem, it also
checks isAutoScroll.  All that's needed to fix is to add the checks to
FailureTab, as well.  Low risk, and medium impact.  Would like to fix for RC2.
Dirk,

On second look, not among the top candidate bugs for RC2.  Recommend postponing.
Daiv, I assign it to you as you can prepare a fix for 3.2. Looks like you
already know what to do.

Patch

This patch updates FailureTab to auto-scroll only if the scroll-lock button is
off.  Likely for 3.2 application.
Tobias,

Can you review at your convenience?  I never assigned this to you way back when.
