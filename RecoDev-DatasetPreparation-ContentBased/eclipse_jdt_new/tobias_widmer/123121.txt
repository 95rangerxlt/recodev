The comment template for "Overriding methods" listed on the Code Templates preference page is used not only used for overriding methods. The corresponding method, getMethodComment(... IMethodBinding overridden ...), is also used by AddDelegateMethodsOperation and now by CreateIndirectionRefactoring, which both utilize the @see tag which is part of (at least) the standard comment.

As this use no longer corresponds to the title "Overriding methods", the title should either be change or a new comment template should be created.

getMethodComment() resides in CodeGeneration.
These methodes should pass 'null' for overridden.
Passing null would choose the normal method template, which does not have the @see tag. However, this tag makes sense in both delegate and indirection methods. 
IMHO it would not be too much effort to introduce a template for delegates and/or indirections.

See bug 94586
Closing, since bug 94586 is fixed.


Java Code Template "Overriding methods" used inconsistently
