The COmmon Navigator framework has added a pipeline which supports content provider overriding. I will add a patch that makes the Java sync content provider override the Resources sync content provider. This will make it easier for clients to use the sync view since they will see a top level list of all their projects instead of projects divided by model.

I needed to change the enablement of the content extension to use triggerPoints an possibleChildren to get overriding to work properly.
Thanks for the patch!
