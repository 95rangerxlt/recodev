Inside a javadoc tag having a html tag with a space
between starting < and tag causes default color
of black to be used.
Eg.
/** < b> some text
 *
 */

As I have my background black it disappears!
I am happy for this tag to not be recognised as a
javadoc html tag but it should use the color for
either 'javadoc other' or 'other'
rather than defaulting to black.

Tobias, I assume it defaults back to "Others" instead of "Javadoc Others".
The problem persists when reopening the editor.

It defaults to some inbuild default for text.
Not to the color of 'Others' or 'Javadoc others'
both of which would be fine for me as these are
set to not be black for me. I think it defaults
to text with no category as none of my categories
are black foreground yet it displays it as black.
Hope this helps, please let me know if you need
more info or anything.
The JavaDocScanner has a pattern rule for recognizing HTML tags. For whatever 
reason, the rule does a simple check whether some whitespaces appear after 
the "<". The correct expression for a html tag should be "<"(blank)*(alpha-
numeric)+(blank)*">".

Space inside JavaDoc HTML Tags cause wrong syntax color highlighting.
