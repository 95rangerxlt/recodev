Select Export > Jar File. Enable option "Annotate with Refactoring Info". Click "Next".

Enable date selection, change a date field, disable the date selection and re-enable it.
Expected: Date selection stays as it was before
Actual: Date selection is reset

Another issue: I think the initial values should be the current date, not the last month. The month is the only non-current field and it is easy to miss this fact, as the hour and even minute is always the current time.

Re initial month: I already fell into this trap (bug 120842).
