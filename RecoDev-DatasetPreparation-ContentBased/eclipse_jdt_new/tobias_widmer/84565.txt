Since this lable provider is useful for others as well we should:

- rename it to BindingLableProvider
- move it to a util package

Additionally it should support the flags defined on JavaElementLabelProvider and
Image Provider. Right now I am missing the flags for controlling whether to use
small aor big images.

Tobias, the dialogs in the source actions should use big images as well since
they look nicer with adornments.
