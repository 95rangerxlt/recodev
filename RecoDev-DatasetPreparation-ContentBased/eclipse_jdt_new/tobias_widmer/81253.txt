- Select 'foo' and invoke Refactor->Move
- Enter 'A'. The error message says that the type is not found, a qualified name
is required
- Do a code assist after 'A'. Choose 'A'. The entered string is 'A', which is
not qualified -> code assist is not a big help here

package p;
public A {
}

package p;
public abstract class VarArgTest {
	
	public static String print12(String key, String... args) {
	}

}

Martin, which foo are you moving.

Markus, can you please investigate.


'foo' stands for 'print12'

Tobias, I think you have fixed this in the move static members refactoring, right? 

The dialog should now also accept unqualified types as long as they are unique
in the context of the originating type. You can just enter 'A' now, and
everything's fine.
Fixed
