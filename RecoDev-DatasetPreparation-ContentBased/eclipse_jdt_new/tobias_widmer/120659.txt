public class Try {
    void m() {
        new Runnable() {
            //content assist here, choose hashCode()
            //-> mediocre formatting, misses @Override and call to super method:
            // public int hashCode() {};
        }
    }
}

Works fine if I add a ; after the anonymous class. Without, the inserted stub is poorly formatted and does not compile.

Looks like a bug in OverrideCompletionProposal.updateReplacementString(...).
Tobias, that's "your" code. Can you look into that, thanks.
