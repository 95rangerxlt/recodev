In some cases the Command shows the error message: "There are no constructors 
from the superclass which may be used."

Reproduce:
1. Create a new class with a Standard Constructor.
2. Create some attributes.
3. Try to create a new constructor using the "Generate Constructor Using Fields" 
command.

Steffen, which build are you using. 

Tobias, please verify if reproducable otherwise close as works for me.
Hi,

I used Version: 3.1.0 (M6)
Build id: I20050401-1645

and the following code:

public class Test
{
    String testString;

    public Test()
    {
        super();
        // TODO implementation of constructor for Test
    }
}

On build 3.1M6 I20050401-1645, it doesnt work like in the previous versions : it
only keep the last part of the variable name as you can see in the sample bellow
 (I didn't find the way to change this in the template code).

	private Date dateCalul_;
	private String fluxInfileName_;
	private String fluxOutFileName_;

	
	/**
	 * @param calul
	 * @param name
	 * @param name
	 */
	public FluxFilterBatch(Date calul, String name, String name) {
		super();
		// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
		dateCalul_ = calul;
		fluxInfileName_ = name;
		fluxOutFileName_ = name;
	}

This has been fixed in newer i builds
