1) create a new CU with a class  MyException that extends Exception
   -> don't save the file and don't build
2) select the warning that not serialVersionUID is defined
3) invoke quick fix
4) select "generated serial version UID"
->the default version UID is inserted:
     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

Since the generated serialversionUID cannot be computed in this situation we 
should inform the user about this rather than falling back on the default 
version UID.

Suggest to provide this information in the preview and when the user still 
selects the quick fix to show a message dialog.

Tobias, we discussed this already. The idea was to get help from JDT/Core to 
compile the file in memory and then use the byte array to compute the SVID. 
Have you heard anything from Core ?

Decided to run a project build before generating the id:
- Preview assumes that the file can be built
- If not, an appropriate message shows up when the user selects the quick fix
