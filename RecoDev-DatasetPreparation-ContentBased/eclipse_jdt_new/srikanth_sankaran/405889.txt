Fix released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=0ae630552c90fd2cd11872eb375a1964a0c6a4c3

I manually verified against 1.5 JRE that there was an NPE before the fix
and that it is gone now. We now report: 

(1) The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the class file for java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles. Fix the build path then try building this project

(2) The type java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
