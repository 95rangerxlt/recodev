BETA_JAVA8: In bug 401610, I handled only message sends and overlooked
explicit constructor calls and allocation expressions. I'll use this
bug to address them.

Combined fix and tests for bug 401789 and bug 401790 delivered here:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=fbf658958d1eb066a4b5c16fdea253c3d8d5019c.

I'll add more tests before closing.
Basic tests are already released, I'll add additional tests on behalf of 
bug 401847 that will exercise poly conditionals in explicit constructor
call and allocation expression contexts.


[1.8][compiler] Follow up of bug 401610, explicit constructor calls and allocation expressions needs updates too.
