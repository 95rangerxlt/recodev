Created attachment 236948
Test case

The attachment is a patch of a testcase in Java8ElementProcessor and it fails when Java8ElementTests are run.

The code is:
public <T> Z(@Type T t){}

When ExecutableTypeImpl#getParameterTypes() is invoked with the above code, we look at the MethodBinding#parameters to create the TypeMirror. But the parameters contains a TypeVariableBinding but the binding doesn't contain the annotations.

We need to check why resolveAnnotations call does not move the annotations
from parameter to type in this case. I can take a look this.
