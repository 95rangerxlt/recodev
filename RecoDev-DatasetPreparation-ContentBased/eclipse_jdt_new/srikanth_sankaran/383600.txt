JSR 308 draft proposal requires support for type annotations
on inner class constructor's receiver using this syntax:

class Outer {
   class Inner {
     @Result Inner(@Receiver Outer Outer.this, boolean b) { }
   }
}

here @Result is a type annotation that is attached to the result type of
the constructed object, while @Receiver is a type annotation attached to 
the type of the receiver of the inner class constructor invocation
i.e the enclosing instance.

Proposed amends to JLS7 grammar rules:

FormalParameters: ( [FormalParameterOrReceiverDecls] )

FormalParameterOrReceiverDecls:
{VariableModifier} UnannType {Identifier .} this [, FormalParameterDecls]

FormalParameterOrReceiverDecls: FormalParameterDecls
