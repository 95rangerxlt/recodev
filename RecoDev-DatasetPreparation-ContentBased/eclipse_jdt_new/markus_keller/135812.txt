N20060410-0010

Have org.eclipse.jface imported as binary plug-in. I found no way to replace all references to TreeSelection by ITreeSelection. 'Use Supertype where possible' only acts on the enclosing type, and only it the type is a source type.

IMO, it should
- act on the current selection (or the enclosing type, if the selection does not resolve to a type), and
- it should also be available on binary types

This works for me using N20060410-0010, selecting TreeSelection either in the Package Explorer or Outline.

Note that there is no refactor context menu in the Java editor on binary elements
The remaining issue is the missing refactor context menu in the ClassFileEditor.

There are now a few refactorings which work on binary elements:
- Use Supertype Where Possible
- Inline Method
- Replace Invocations

Changing title to reflect request
Additional candidate:
- Introduce Indirection
Don't want to add this so late in the game. Marking for 3.3.
Is available in latest builds.
