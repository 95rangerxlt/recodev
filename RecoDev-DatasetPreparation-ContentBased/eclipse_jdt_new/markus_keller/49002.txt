- The window title says 'Move static member(s)'
 the brackets look really ugly. Why not just write 'Move static members'? It's 
the name of the refactoring. Or be precice and write either 'member' 
or 'members'
- When moving a single method that returns something it says
'Destination type for 'IJavaElement create(File)':
This looks like my method is in IJavaElement, but that's the return type.
-> Put the return type behind the method name (or leave ir away!) like it is 
done in the outline (use JavaElementLabels to render this)
or put the declaring type 'JavaCore.create(IFile)'

Agree on the title. It should be names "Move static memnbers" because thats 
the refactoring.

For the label I opt for "Destination type of method 'foo':"
Fixed > 2004-01-05.

I removed the return type from the label, but left the parameters there. I also
think the member kind (method / non-method) is a valuable information which
should be displayed, but not necessarily by explicitly writing 'method',
'field', or 'type'. The parameters also help to identify the overloaded method
version.
