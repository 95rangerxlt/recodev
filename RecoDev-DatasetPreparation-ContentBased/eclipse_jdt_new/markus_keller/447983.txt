Mac OS X, org.eclipse.jdt.text.tests.performance.ScrollEditorTest must not press Ctrl+Arrow_Down/Up for Scroll Line Down/Up.

These shortcuts have been hijacked by Apple by default for system-wide "Mission Control" and "Application Windows" commands. The effects when running e.g. ScrollAnnotatedJavaEditorTest#testScrollJavaEditorLineWise1() is an endless flickering that is hard to cancel (hint: try Command+Q).

I guess we best remove the shortcuts for Scroll Line Down/Up on the Mac and change the tests to set custom shortcuts.
