I200312162000 (M6 test pass)

see also bug 46926

- on gtk, <Return> does start to edit a cell, but the default button of the
dialog is still pressed

-> need to not invoke the default button
-> a different edit key stroke (F2!) wouldn not hurt

- adding a parameter using 'Add' and then pressing <Esc> does not cancel the
addition, leaving an empty row which can hardly be distinguished from a non-row.
The only indication of an empty row is the error message telling to 'Enter the
type for the new parameter'.

-> indicate empty rows by filling some default values (e.g. '[type]').

Tom, what do you mean with "the default button is still pressed".

Markus, Canceling ADD should indeed not add a parameter.
Fixed > 2004-01-05:
- F2 for editing
- caught TRAVERSE_RETURN (Tom, please verify on GTK that the dialog doesn't
close on <Return>)
- for the added parameter, see bug 49230
