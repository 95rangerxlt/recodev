Works fine on WindowsXP. Need to check whether this works with next build. Otherwise we need to investigate closer.

Works fine on WindowsXP. Need to check whether this works with next build. Otherwise we need to investigate closer.
The main console for the dev workspace shows this error:
!ENTRY org.eclipse.pde.core.launching 4 101 2010-04-26 09:03:21.946
!MESSAGE No test found with test runner 'JUnit 3'.

Same problem with I20100425-2000.
The 'org.eclipse.equinox.ds' bundle which is required via import-package was missing and unfortunately neither the importer nor the validator report this (see bug 255526 and bug 256596).
