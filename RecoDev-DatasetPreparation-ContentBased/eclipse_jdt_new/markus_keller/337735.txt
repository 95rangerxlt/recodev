Remove workarounds for Ant builder bug in Jar in Jar Loader
Created attachment 189436
Fix 2

I've released the first patch, but then I saw that this causes the Jar to be rebuilt after clean. That's not what we want. We need to keep the empty "After a Clean" task. I've updated the comment in build_jar-in-jar-loader.xml.
Fixed in HEAD.

JDT/UI Team: Please ignore any outgoing changes in
    /org.eclipse.jdt.ui/jar-in-jar-loader.zip
that could show up in your workspace if you updated to the first fix.
The workarounds were for bug 114563.

So, they can be removed now?

No. The workarounds were initially to avoid bug 114563, but when I wanted to remove them, I found that the dummy clean target is still necessary, see comment 2. The workaround has morphed into the proper fix, and I've documented that in build_jar-in-jar-loader.xml.

Bug 335999 updated the doc to explain the 4 build targets.
