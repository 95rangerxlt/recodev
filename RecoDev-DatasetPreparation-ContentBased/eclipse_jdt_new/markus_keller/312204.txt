Groovy Eclipse is subclassing from NewTestCaseWizardPageOne to create JUnit wizard for Groovy.

It is hard to change the default superclass used for a JUnit3 style testcase. Using setSuperClass doesn't quite work because there is a call to a private method  "internalSetJUnit4" which will reset it when a user clicks the JUnit radio buttons.

I've attached a patch with a proposed solution that makes a minimal change NewTestCaseWizardPageOne class. The change is behavior preserving, but it delegates the choice of the default superclass for JUnit 3 tests to a protected method which can easily be overriden.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
NA

Looks good, but unfortunately, we're past the API freeze for 3.6. Could you please attach a new patch with these changes for 3.7?

- fix Javadoc: add @since 3.7, add @return, use wording that is more similar to other Javadocs (i.e. "Clients can override [to]...").

- fill out this template and add it to the header comment:
