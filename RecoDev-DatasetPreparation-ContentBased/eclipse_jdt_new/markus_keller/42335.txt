Fix

Problem was a string mismatch of action/command ids.

IJavaEditorActionDefinitionIds is a public interface declaring the action ids.
=> Let's change it in the plugin.xml (this breaks user-defined keybindings, but
they can easily be re-created with the new keybinding dialog).

The fix also corrects "Move Member Type to New File...", which had the same
problem.
