1. Create a file B.java:

  public class \u0042 {
  
  	public static \u0042 newInstance() {
  		return new \u0042();
  	}
  
  	public \u0042() {
  	}
  }

2. Rename file to C.java in Package Explorer.

3. Output is now:

  public class C {

  	public static \u004C newInstance() {
  		return new \u004C();
  	}

  	public C() {
  	}
  }
  
   Notice that the Unicode literals have become corrupted.

4. Press Ctrl-Z to undo:

  public class B {

  	public static \u004C new2nstance() {
  		return new \u004C();
  2	}
  
  	public B() {
  	}
  }

  The code is now nothing like the original.

Yes, Rename avoids building expensive ASTs since the match ranges are all we need. Fixed the manual updating of ranges by using a scanner for rename type, field, and method (in case of qualified type matches / method reference matches that include argument lists).

Fixed the basic use case in HEAD.

Filed bug 180970 for the Undo problem.
Filed bug 180973 for problems with linked mode in editor.
