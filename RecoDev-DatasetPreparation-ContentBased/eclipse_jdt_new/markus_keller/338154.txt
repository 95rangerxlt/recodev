HEAD

The "Automatically close <angle> brackets" feature from the Typing preference page should not add the closing > when it is already present. This already works fine for (parentheses):

import java.util.*;

public class Try {
    void foo(Object o) {
        List<String> var= new ArrayList|String>();
        foo|var);
    }
}

When you replace the "|" with "<" and "(", respectively, then you see the good behavior for "(" and the bad additional ">" that gets inserted after the "<".

Fix & Test

I took a look at the implementation and saw that it's not as easy as counting brackets.

A strategy that better suits editing in 1.5 code is to avoid closing angle brackets if the token following the caret location is the start of a valid type argument.
Fixed in HEAD.
Thanks.
