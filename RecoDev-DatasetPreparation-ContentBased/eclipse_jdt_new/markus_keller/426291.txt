In recent Mac OS X versions (at least since 10.8), Mission Control by default uses shortcuts Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down. Their Shift-ed variants do the same, but slow down the animations. Yes, they sacrificed shortcuts for a show-effect nobody needs.

"Expand Selection To > Enclosing Element" and "Restore Last Selection" conflict with Mission Control. We have to reassign at least those two commands, but to keep the four directions in sync, I've also reassigned the "Next/Previous Element" commands.
