Problem is that JavaElements and AstNodes have a different opinion whether
//Comments should belong to an adjacent memeber or not.

I'll attach tests.


To reproduce: Move odd to B.

A.java:
package p;
public class A {
	public final static String id= "Thing.id"; //$NON-NLS-1$
	public final static String odd= "Thing.odd"; //$NON-NLS-1$
}

B.java:
package p;
public class B {
}

Fix.

Uses the ASTNode of the member declaration to extract the updated member from
source (previous implementation used JavaElements, which is unnecessary
overhead).

Bug 41734 tells why test32 is disabled.


Move static members fails if "//" is before member [refactoring]
