The editor inplace Rename refactoring is not consistent with dialog refactoring: while the dialog refactoring forces/requires the user to look at the preview when textual matches are replace, no preview is shown when renaming inplace.

So - either the preview is really a must in the textual case and then it also has to appear in the inplace mode, or it is not a must and then the user must not be forced to look at it in the dialog mode.

I think the in-place rename never does a textual replace, Markus?

Yes it does -- it always takes the settings from the Rename dialog.
We should force the preview in lightweight mode as well.
Fix will be to show the preview also when the user clicked Refactor or pressed the Enter key. That's like in the wizard, where Enter also goes to the preview page when the preview is forced. 
Fixed.
