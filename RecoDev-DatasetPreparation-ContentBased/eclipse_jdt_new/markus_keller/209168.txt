Opening matches inside jars with doubleclick or drag-and-drop broken:

- new workspace
- import org.eclipse.debug.core as binary plug-in
- search for references to IResource#isReadOnly()

=> dragging members inside org.eclipse.core.resources_3.3.100.v20071026.jar to editor does not work (no-drop cursor)

=> dragging members inside org.eclipse.debug.core_3.4.0.v20071031.jar to editor opens the jar file in a text editor

=> double-clicking members inside org.eclipse.debug.core_3.4.0.v20071031.jar opens the jar file in the system editor (WinZip in my case)

Doubleclicking is fixed in HEAD, DND still broken.

DnD for elements inside JARs to the editor area never worked. JDT should not be a drag source in this case.

We should rather fix that case. Dragging a type from an (internal or external) jar to the Type Hierarchy already works fine, so I don't see why this shouldn't work for DnD to the editor area.

Really? TH and other JDT views know binary elements - editor area doesn't.

Fix

Easy fix: support EditorInputTransfer.

Patch also does it for Package Explorer, Type Hierarchy, and Call Hierarchy (whose drag support was broken anyway because it did only pass out the internal model elements).
Released to HEAD.
Does not work for me.

Did not work for internal jars. Fixed in HEAD by making sure that the EditorInputTransferDragAdapter is added before the ResourceTransferDragAdapter.
