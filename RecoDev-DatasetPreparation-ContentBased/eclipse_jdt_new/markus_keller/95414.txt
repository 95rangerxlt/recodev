Build: 3.1 M7

I find the new history section of the Open Type dialog to be so useful, that I
now frequently close all (Ctrl+Shift+W) when things become cluttered.  After
that, I frequently want to just reopen a small number of types from my history.
 It would be neat if I could multi-select types in the Open Type dialog,
allowing me to quickly reopen several recently used types in my history at once.

John, I agree that this would be nice but it raises a couple of other questions
(for example what do we show in the container info status when more than one
type is selected). Since we are wrapping up 3.1 I am more in favour of deferring
this since the UI story isn't clear to me.

Dirk,

What John might mean is this :
Sometimes I want to open a set of files using the open type dialog.
For example :
I might have a series of files named 'ProductXXX'.
When I open the type dialog, I'd type 'Product' which would list me say six files.
I'd like to open all of them by selecting them using control-click and then open.
It would make me more productive.

Yes Geert, that is exactly my use case as wel.. As for Dirk's question about what to put in the container info status area - it could be left blank when there is a multi-selection, since the package name is shown for selected elements anyway.
The status line should show the same as other Java views with multiselection show in the workbench window status line: '<count> items selected'.

I think we should try to implement this in 3.3.
This has been fixed a while ago.
Bug 175817 is for showing the items count in the status line.
