The problem is probably not the order of the tests themselves, but the order of the tests that are executed by the JUnitJunitTests (in the 3rd VM).

Solution will be to use OrderedTestSuite also in the 3rd VM.

Also needs re-generated rtstubs15.jar and rtstubs16.jar (the old ones are missing annotations).
Fixed for I20110427-1800.
