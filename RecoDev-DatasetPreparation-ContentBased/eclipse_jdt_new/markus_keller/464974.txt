Wrong display of file path including bidi data_Dynamic cases

Build ID: I20150320-0800
Steps to reproduce:
      1.Click Window -> Preferences
      2.Expand Java -> Installed JREs
      3.Select the installed JRE and Click Edit
      4.Select the "External annotations:(none)" under rt.jar and Click External annotations button
      5.Click Browse... 
      6.Select the folder including bidi data      

Problem Description:
Wrong display of structured text (file path) including bidi data on External Annotation Attachment Configuration panel.

Platform provides following level of support for structured text:

1. Dynamic cases (editable controls, like input fields, combo box etc.)
 Use following API (from org.eclipse.jface.util.BidiUtils package) in the appropriate graphical 
context (label, field):
BidiUtils.applyBidiProcessing(sourceField, StructuredTextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE);  
sourceField is the control in which file path appears.


2. Static cases (not editable controls like labels)
One need to work on the string level (rather than on graphical control level). You should use function leanToFullText defined in the class: org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal.StructuredTextImpl.
 Sample call : 
 resultStr = 
   STextExpertFactory.getExpert(STextTypeHandlerFactory.FILE).leanToFullText (inputStr)

Please help investigate.Thanks.

Reassigning bug to UI for Initial investigation.
If s.o. can provide a hint on how I can test this, I'll be happy to fix this (will also help me understand how to avoid such bugs in the future).

Is it only the External Annotation Path, or is, e.g., Javadoc location also affected? (I had a quick glance at the label computation for both cases and could not see any difference).

For the text fields I do see the omission regarding External Annotation Path.
Fixed comment 0 with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=44d0b88b4b784106678b9f4acfbc7e29c78168fb , including fix for source attachment dialogs.

I can only reproduce comment 1 when I start up with a locale that is not nl-supported. Those strings are rendered using TextProcessor, which is only active for locales iw, he, ar, fa, ur.

Start with -nl ar to get correct labels.
(In reply to Stephan Herrmann from comment #3)
The SourceAttachmentBlock already missed bidi-processing, so you're not to blame for this.

http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/bidi.html gives some introduction to bidi support in Eclipse. However, there are still some rough edges on GTK.

To test bidi-behavior, you can start up with these command line arguments:
-nl he -bidi on=y;dir=rtl

To see which Text fields already get bidi-processed, you can enable tracing: http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/guide/tools/launchers/tracing.htm
Options to set:
org.eclipse.jface/debug=true
org.eclipse.jface/debug/bidiUtils=true

Thanks.

These hints will definitely help for the future (now I only need to learn some RTL language :) ).
Hi Markus and Stephan,

Start up with these command line arguments: -nl he -bidi on=y;dir=rtl on build I20150428-0100 to test the fixing and the result is as below:
1. The Path for Workspace location and External location on External Annotation Attachment Configuration panel are fixed.
2. The display for External annotation path is wrong after selecting the location for external annotations, currently the display for path is "RTL" not "LTR" , the path should keep "LTR". please refer to the attachment.
3.The display for JRE home path is wrong

Based on 2 and 3, reopen this defect. Please help investigate again.
Thanks a lot.

Comment 7-9 are UI elements provided by JDT Debug.

Nothing in JDT Debug is currently bidi-aware. Filed bug 467116 and mentioned this problem there.
