HEAD

APT Javadocs are currently generated separately from the JDT Javadoc. The reason for that was that the APT used 1.5 Javadoc, but JDT was on 1.4. Nowadays, everything is generated with 1.6, so we can merge the two and avoid the artificial split.

I don't think we will need a separate group for APT -- it's just a part of JDT Core.

I was first for the separation but now I'm also fine merging them.

Fix

After looking at it more closely, the com.sun.mirror.* at the beginning of the third group (Other Packages) looks too prominent. I've kept APT separate and also added groups for the other packages.
Fixed in HEAD.


Merge generated APT Javadoc into JDT Javadoc
