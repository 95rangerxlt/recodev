Paste this into an empty Package Explorer:
public MyClass(
   int    param1,
   String param2,
   long   param3
)
{
}
==> you get a strange error message talking about selected elements.
Same as in 3.2.

What would you propose as an error message?
Would "Cannot paste clipboard contents into current selection." be better?

Unfortunately, we cannot disable the action upfront for performance reasons.
>Would "Cannot paste clipboard contents into current selection." be better?
I wouldn't even mention the selection since it is irrelevant (at least for this scenario). The main message is that the text in the clipboard is not a valid code snippet.
==>
"Cannot paste: the text in the clipboard is not a valid code snippet".

Of course you need to show a different message if the clipboard type itself isn't accepted by the target.
The problem is that the clipboard can contain arbitrary combinations of text and non-text transfers. E.g. when it contains files, it usually also contains the file names. We cannot show meaningful messages for all combinations that can result in failures.

I've changed the message to "Cannot paste the clipboard contents." if there's no selection and "Cannot paste the clipboard contents into the selected elements." otherwise.
