HEAD

In a Java project with project-specific Javadoc preferences but no project-specific Java Errors/Warnings, hover over a Javadoc problem, focus the hover, and then click 'Configure Problem Severity' in the hover toolbar.

A dialog asks me whether I want to use project-specific settings, but since I already have such settings, the dialog should not show up.

Fixed in HEAD (bug in ProblemHover).
