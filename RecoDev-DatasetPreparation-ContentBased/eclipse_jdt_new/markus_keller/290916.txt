Build Identifier: M20090211-1700

By default when using the Recreate Testsuite-Wizard it also checks the AllTests-Suite itself to be included and shows a warning. 

I wonder why this choice was made, since I always have to uncheck it inorder to prevent a Stackoverflowerror when running the AllTests-Suite afterwards. Is there any special reason for this behaviour? May be you could add an option somewhere in the preferences or remember the last choice when using the wizard.

Reproducible: Always

I agree. Unchecked the current suite by default.
