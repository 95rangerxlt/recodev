Steps to reproduce:
- Create JUnit example project (1.4 compliance)
- Invoke "Infer Type Arguments..."
-> Refactoring builds whole constraint system, but issues a warning only at 
the end of precondition checking.
-> Either issue an error before final precondition checking or generate a 
warning that the project compliance is set to 5.0
