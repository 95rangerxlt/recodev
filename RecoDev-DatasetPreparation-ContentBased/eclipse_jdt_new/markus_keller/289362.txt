The Junit view has the ability to open the XML file resulting from a test run. This is really neat. However I would be even more useful if it could open a file from an HTTP server such that when my test fails I could directly point the junit view to the result files and browse the results of the tests in a very familiar way. For example, for the eclipse builds they are buried at http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/N20090912-2000/testresults/xml/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.tests_macosx.cocoa.x86_5.0.xml

I guess this needs another entry in the History drop-down, e.g. "Import from URL...".

Could also do it even fancier with a drop listener for URLs or a Paste action.

The hard part is to find out how to open an URL connection in Eclipse that properly deals with the proxy settings from the platform.
The RepositoryTransport class in the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.repository byundle would do that for you (and probably more), but this is kind of a weird dependency for you to have. Maybe you can just copy what we have there.
But to start with, even if you were just opening using URL.openstream it would significantly ease my pain :)
Fixed in HEAD. The history dropdown button now has an "Import from URL..." item.
.
I like it!
In HEAD, I also added a drop listener to the JUnit view, so can now just drag a link (e.g. from the test result page if bug 290883 is implemented) and drop it to the view to open test results.
