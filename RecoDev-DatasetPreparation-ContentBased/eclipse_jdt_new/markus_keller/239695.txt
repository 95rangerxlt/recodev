Build ID: I20080617-2000

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a new Java project, and delete it again (do not delete contents)
2. Move the java project somewhere outside the workspace using Windows Explorer
3. Create a new Java project from existing source, select that place.
4. File->Export->Jar file, Next
5. Select that project in the "resources to export"
6. Browse for export destination, select the project folder and some filename (example.jar).
7. Click Finish.

Actual result:
Eclipse asks if it should create the folder inside the workspace (in the Explorer selector, I selected the existing folder outside the workspace) and if I say yes, the Jar is exported into the new folder in the workspace.

Expected result: 
The jar is stored in the project directory outside the workspace

Workaround: Type the full path to the project directory into the export destination box manually.

Can reproduce.
I encountered the same behavior today. Then I found this bug note.
Fixed in HEAD of JarPackageData.
The fix introduced new bug 281867.
