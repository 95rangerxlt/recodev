In junit.samples.money.Money select Money in Line 27 and start a rename refactoring on this type.
Enter something. Press crtl-z. The animation now is quite nasty because the hover is repainted for every character.
Enter something else and press ctrl-z again. Each change of a character done by linked mode is undo'ed as single undo.

Moving to text, since the missing composite undo is a linked mode problem.
I'll re-check the hover repositioning after this has been fixed.

OK, then I'll take this back to JDT/UI for the other issues.
Fixed in HEAD. We don't redraw any more when the TextEvent says that viewer redraw is off.
