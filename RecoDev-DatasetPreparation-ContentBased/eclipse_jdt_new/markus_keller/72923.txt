This process is a little inconsistant.  Sometimes it will work, but most of the 
time it will not remove the empty package structure.

1. Delete a java file in a package from the Package Explorer
2. Both java file and the empty package disappear from the Package Explorer
3. Add another file to the project
4. Click Refresh from the Package Explorer

Expected Results:
The empty package should not show up

Actual Results:
The empty package shows up
Delete this package again
Add a file
Click Refresh
The empty package shows up with one directory removed from it

Cary, anything in the log file ?
Is your Package Explorer in hierarchical or in flat mode?
Are the following filters enabled or disabled:
- Empty packages
- Empty parent packages
- Java files
- Non-java elements

Could you tell exactly what file (path & filename) you have in hand at each step
and whether you create/delete the file from within eclipse or from the Windows
Explorer.

"Empty packages" (aka folders) should never be removed when you remove a file.
But, depending on your filters, they should sometimes not show up.
No new entries in the .log file
Package Explorer is in hierarchical
Filters:
  Empty Packages: Off
  Empty parent packages: On
  Java Files: Off
  Non-Java Elements: Off

Linked source directory:
C:\Development\Source\cmm65\commons\modules\commons\visual\src\java

1. Empty Source Directory
2. Using Winzip extract a source file to
C:\Development\Source\cmm65
\commons\modules\commons\visual\src\java\extensions\interfaces\framework\message
s\file.java
3. In Package Explorer, Right click on the project and click refresh
4. New package and java file is then displayed
5. Right click on the new package and click on Delete
6. Confirm delete package
7. Package and contents disappear from Package Explorer
8. File system contains empty package for:
C:\Development\Source\cmm65
\commons\modules\commons\visual\src\java\extensions\interfaces\framework

Message directory is deleted

9. Click refresh
10. extentions package does not show up
11. Create a new file in the project Right click (new -> class) and create any 
class
12. Empty package will now show up
13. Right click on the new package and click on Delete
14. Confirm delete package
15. Package and contents disappear from Package Explorer
16. File system contains empty package for:
C:\Development\Source\cmm65
\commons\modules\commons\visual\src\java\extensions\interfaces

Expected the entire package to be removed the first time the package was 
deleted.
Expected empty package to be displayed after refresh

Could not reproduce problem with hierarchical mode. Fixed in flat mode by
refreshing the source folder after removal of a package and thus showing the
formerly missing parent package.
