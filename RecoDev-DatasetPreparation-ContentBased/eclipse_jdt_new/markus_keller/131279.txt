The generated method is not an overriding method, but rather a static delegate.
Martin has fixed this in HEAD. Using normal method comment now.
Markus, there is a new delegate method comment. Did you take this one?
Adding Martin to explain why normal method comment is better than delegate comment.
I think the created method is not really seen as a delegate; the point of the refactoring is is to make modifications on the body.
Specific comment templates are only useful if they are used at specific places. If we use them in too many, slightly different setups, it will be hard to redefine the template to include somthing useful.

For this reason I think it is better to just create the generic 'new method' template.
