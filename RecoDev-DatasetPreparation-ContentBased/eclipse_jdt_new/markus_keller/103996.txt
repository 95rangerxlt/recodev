Shortcut "c" is specified for both - "Generate method comment" and "Replace 1
duplicate code fragment" checkboxes.

Steps to reproduce:
1) type following lines of code:
      System.out.println("Hello!");
      System.out.println("Hello!");

2) Select the first line, call local menu, call Refactor/Extract Method local
menu item.

3) Extract Method dialog pops up. "Replace 1 duplicate code fragment" checkbox
of the dialog is selected, has "c" shortcut

4) Press Alt+C to uncheck the checkbox

What should happen:
- the checkbox should be unchecked

What really happens:
- "Generate method comment" checkbox is checked because it also has shortcut "c".
