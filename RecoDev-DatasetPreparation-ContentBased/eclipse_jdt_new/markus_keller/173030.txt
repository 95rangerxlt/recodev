To disable the preview action might be a good idea. Or at least show a dialog when it is invoked with no change yet.
I disabled the actions initially, see bug 173053. Showing a dialog would be too much (after all, we wanted to reduce dialogs;-).

Currently, Enter and Ctrl+Enter just end the linked mode when the identifier has not changed. This is the same as the 'Rename in file' quick assist does, and I tend to leave it like this. Would that be OK for you?
yes.
Fixed with the fix for bug 173053.
