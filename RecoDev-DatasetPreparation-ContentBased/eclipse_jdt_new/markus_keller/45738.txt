Eclipse 3.0M4

Having an anonymous class defined in a static method, "Convert Anonymous Class to Nested" 
creates an inner class (a non-static nested class), resulting in a compilation error because the 
created class is not accessible from the static method.

Expected: Eclipse doesn't create an inner class but a static nested class.

Agree. 

Markus can you please fix this.
Works in 200405140800.

Creating a new nested static class "Runner" works as it should in this example:

public class A {
	static void doit() {
		Runnable runner= new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println("HelloWorld");
			}
		};
		runner.run();
	}
}


"Convert Class to Nested" creates inner class [refactoring]
