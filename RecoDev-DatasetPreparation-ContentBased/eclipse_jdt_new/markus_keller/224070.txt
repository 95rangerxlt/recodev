Version: 3.4.0
Build id: I20080324-1300

(sounds like introduced between 331 and 332)

1 - create a Java Project
2 - open the New Class Wizard
3 - click the Add button to add an interface
4 - select Entry from java.util.Map and add it
Note: interface java.util.Map.Entry is added
5 - remove the '.E' in the added interface
6 - invoke CA at cursor (|): java.util.Map.E|

before 332: java.util.Map.Entry is added

after 332 (and this is the bug): java.util.Map.java.util.Map.Entry
is added

As a variation, also note that if you remove all the text before the interface icon, you'll notice it gets highlighted as proposing some Content Assist.

Invoke CA: nothing shows-up

--> we should not suggest there might be CA when none will be displayed.

The jdtcore completion proposal seems to be correct.

Moving to JDT/Text.


To be investigated during M7.
Not text. Already broken in M5 and not critical for M6.
Fixed in HEAD.
