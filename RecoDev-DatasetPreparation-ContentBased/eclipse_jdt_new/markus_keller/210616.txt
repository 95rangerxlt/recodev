this jdt.ui test is running OK with v825, but not with HEAD.

expected result:

	private T f;
	class B<T>{
		static <S> S f(S t) {
			T s=t;
			return null;
		}

actual result:
package p;

I'll investigate
This test failed after that fix for bug 210273 was released.
David, can you continue the investigation?

Finally, as there were other code released without changing the buildnotes, my conclusion was definitely wrong. The failure has nothing to deal with bug 210273!

Tuning the research in JDT/Core code changes since v_825, I was able to find the real origin of this failure: the patch released for bug 210427 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=83417).

As Eric said, this test pas with JDT/Core v_825 but failed when you apply this patch...


The new behavior is actually better. The test should be improved.

As noticed in bug 210427, some errors could have prevented the compiler from parsing some method bodies. By doing so, it did not surface the body of method #f(...), so renaming failed to rename it.


Markus, can you fix ASAP?
Fixed the bogus test data in HEAD. Thanks for the investigations.
