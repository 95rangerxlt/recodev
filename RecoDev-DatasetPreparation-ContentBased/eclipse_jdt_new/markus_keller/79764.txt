Dirk,

This is a polish item with a two-line fix, very low risk.  The test for whether
to disable the stop button only checks if the launch is debug mode, not also
whether the "keep junit running..." checkbox was enabled.  Recommend fix for RC2.

Proposed fix

This checks whether the "keepalive" checkbox was actually checked before
allowing the Stop button to stay enabled.
David, we should release this when 3.1 is shipped.
Fixed in HEAD.
