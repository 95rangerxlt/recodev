Build: 3.2 RC3

It frequently happens that I hit Ctrl+Shift+T to open a type, but it gets blocked either by an operation or by indexing. For example, on startup it gets blocked by "initializing java tooling".  The problem is, after waiting 10-30 seconds it breaks my concentration and I forget what I was searching for.  It would be nice if the dialog opened *immediately* upon hitting Ctrl+Shift+T, and allowed to start entering text right away.  I don't mind if I then have to wait for indexing and background jobs before the list of matches is populated.  

Maybe a progress region could be incorporated directly into the bottom of the open type dialog, allowing me to type my filter text while waiting for background tasks to complete. See for example the Open Resource dialog, which never forces you to wait before entering text, even when it has not yet computed the list.

+1 from my side. Bug 96077 and bug 110586 mention the same problem, but John's suggestion of showing progress in the dialog is IMO the cleanest approach.
