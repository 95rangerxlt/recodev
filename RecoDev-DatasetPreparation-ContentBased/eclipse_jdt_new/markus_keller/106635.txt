There are five return statements, all of which have no whitespace immediately 
after the return keyword.  A local can't be extracted if any of these return 
statements's expression is entirely selected.

------------------------ Bug.java -------------------------
class Bug {
    public String toString(){
        return'?'+super.toString();
    }
    String asString(){
        return"?"+toString();
    }
    public int hashCode(){
        return(1+super.hashCode());
    }
    int code(){
        return+1;
    }
    float real(){
        return.1f;
    }
}

*** Bug 128916 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
It looks like extract local does not use ASTRewrite here (bug 103970 should have fixed it in ASTRewrite).

Nevertheless, the fact that you can omit whitespace after 'return' is just an anomaly in Java's grammar ...
Works for me using 3.2 RC6
Does not work.

E.g. select '.1f' in real() and press Ctrl+Alt+L -> refactored code is:
    float real(){
        float f= .1f;
        returnf;
    }

Works fine in I20070511-0010.


[extract local] Can't extract local from return without whitespace.
