At least on Windows NT/2000 this item is shown as disabled until the user clicks
it it which case the submenu opens. I have been looking into this problem but
without any results so far. Any suggestions are welcome.

the fix I expected was that it would be enable
Jens,

I have just discovered this problem myself and am working on a fix.

Fix for enablement bug

Patch against the org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.callhierarchy package.

Fixes the enablement problem of the Search Scope view menu item.
Thanks a lot, Jesper, for that QuickFix ;-)

Released the patch.

BTW: How did you create the patch? Strangely, the first three diffs in the patch
don't have a path name, but the added files do.
I just created the patch using Eclipse (pointing to the
org.eclipse...callhierarchy package), generating to the clipboard and then
saving the file. I'm using M7 on Win2000. I know that I have had problems
before. Are there any other suggested ways to do it?

Jesper
Hm, I'm not aware of other ways (apart from saving into a file instead of the
clipboard way -- but I don't see how that could matter here).

I tried to reproduce the problem, but was not able to. If you find a
reproducible case, platform/cvs would welcome a bug report.
