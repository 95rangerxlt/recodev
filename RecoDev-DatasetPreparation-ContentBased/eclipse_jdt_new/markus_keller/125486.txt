I strongly agree after having deleted my last weeks project with one click.
Thanks for having a local history ;-)

This is especially an issue because it looks like it would be another package although it is actually the root of _all_ packages.

(I used the default package only to import sample code and wanted to get rid of it before making a release.)
Fixed in HEAD and added regression tests.
