NLS Search currently does not support rerunning a search (same as for NLS Search
in old search view). If the "Search Again" menu is not disabled, then bug 57111
is not yet fixed in your eclipse version.

Do you want me to implement this as an enhancement?
Would be nice to have search again for NLS. But only as enhancement and time 
permitted for 3.0.
Fixed in HEAD.
