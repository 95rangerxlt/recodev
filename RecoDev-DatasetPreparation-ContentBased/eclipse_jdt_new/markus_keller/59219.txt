During the smoke-test:

!MESSAGE Image data not available: URLImageDescriptor(platform:/plugin/org.eclip
se.jdt.ui_3.0.0/icons/full/obj16/obj.gif)
Fixed for I20040420.

The problem was that image strings for images in JavaPluginImages have to be
prefixed with "NAME_PREFIX + "
iff they are created with createManaged(..)
