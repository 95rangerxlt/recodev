I have tests which extend XMLTestCase from XMLUnit. The JUnit runner attempts to execute the tests in XMLTestCase which causes a failure because it has no tests.

I do not think that the runner should attempt to run tests in XMLTestCase since its not in the source tree.

JUnit 3

We need to check whether this has been introduced by the new JUnit4 support.
Tobias please investigate whether this is a regression. According to Erich this might be a problem since day one. In that case we won't change the code for 3.2.
We cannot reproduce but might use a different steps. Can you provide more details about your setup?

I managed to reproduce it in a new project as follows:

1. Create a new project
2. add the XMLUnit jar to the build path: http://xmlunit.sourceforge.net/
3. add the junit library to the build path
4. create a test case that extends XMLTestCase
5. create a test method
6. select the source folder, right-click and select 'Run as JUnit test'

The runner will run the test you created and also attempt to run tests in org.custommonkey.xmlunit.XMLTestCase. The latter will result in a warning in the JUnit runner view saying that there were no tests found in XMLTestCase.


Strange enough, this example does not work for JUnit 3.8.1:

import org.custommonkey.xmlunit.XMLTestCase;

public class MyTest extends XMLTestCase {

	public void test() throws Exception {
		
	}
}

but it works using JUnit 4.1:

import org.custommonkey.xmlunit.XMLTestCase;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyTest extends XMLTestCase {

	@Test
	public void test() throws Exception {
		
	}
}
This did work in 3.0. Must be a regression which has been introduced during the 3.2 timeframe.
It also works using I20060504-2000, but not with I20060505-0010 (which is severly broken anyway). Dani and Channing, can you confirm this?
We will have to check with the next build.
Marking as RC4 candidate.

I was unable to get I20060505-0010 so I tried I20060505-1306 and I20060504-2000. The bug was still present in both versions for me.
Can reproduce, same (wrong) behavior as in 3.1. Not a regression.

suggested fix

probably not for RC4. Not a regression and workaround is to use a suite instead of running on a source folder
hi, is there any chance the fix will be available in a integration or milestone release soon?

Channing
Fixed in HEAD.
great thanks.
Hi,

I was wondering if this will make it into the next 3.2 maintenance release?

Channing

No, since it's not a regression and there's a workaround.
ok, thanks - I should have checked the target milestone on the bug.
Hi,
I would like to request that this fix be rolled into the next 3.2 milestone release.

I know there is a workaround but it would be much appreciated if you would be so kind as to include it in a 3.2 release :-)
