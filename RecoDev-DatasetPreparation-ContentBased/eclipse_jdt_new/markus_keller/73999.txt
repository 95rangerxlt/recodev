I have a method that is part of an interface implementation, and I do an
Introduce Parameter", only the one implementation class is changed.  I should be
1) warned that the method is an "interface method", and 2) be given the choice
of a) making just the local change, b) making the change to the interface an all
implementors (like Change Method Signature will) or c) cancelling.

Markus, we should solve this for 3.1 by using change method signature 
internally.
This has been fixed for 3.1M6.


Introduce Parameter does not "ripple up" through interfaces [refactoring]
