It is not fair for the PerformChangeOperation#setSchedulingRule() API call to not allow a "null" scheduling rule. There are some TextChange's that do not require any rules at all to run, like DocumentChange. Please loosen the API restrictions to allow a null scheduling rule.

Fair enough, I lifted this restriction.
