1. Right click a referenced library
2. Properties
3. Javadoc
4. Provide a javadoc location url, take:
http://72.5.124.55/javaee/5/docs/api/
5. Ok
6. Reopen the javadoc property page
7. Change url to:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/
8. Ok
9. Reopen the javadoc property page
Is:
 The javadoc location url is still http://72.5.124.55/javaee/5/docs/api/
Should:
 be changed to http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/

72.5.124.55 resolves to java.sun.com. I guess a compare is made on the URLs, which resolves the IP and hence the dialog thinks, that the two urls are equals.

Workaround is to change the url to a dummy url first and then to the correct one.

That would be a nice item for an external contributor, wouldn't it? ;-)
I'll fix this.
Fixed.
