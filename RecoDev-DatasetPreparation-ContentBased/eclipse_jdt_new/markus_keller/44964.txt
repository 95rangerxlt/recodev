Type in the following code:

		int abc = 0;
		if (true) {
			 System.out.println(abc)
		}

Try to rename abc. It will fail because system.out.println doesn't have a 
semicolon. I should be allowed to rename even if there are comilation errors.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 44983 ***
Verified for 3.2 M5 using build I20060215-0010.
Even with bug 42253 fixed, I still cannot rename the local variable.
I get following "Rename Local Variable" error dialog:
"A local variable  declaration or reference  must be selected to activate this refactoring"

Adding missing semicolon of course open correctly the refactoring dialog and local variable is the same than without semicolon => seems not to be a robust AST issue => Reopen as this is not a duplicate bug

Not a duplicate but depended on bug 42253
I would suggest to use an AST with recovery but unly for the rename local case.
Fixed for rename local variable.
