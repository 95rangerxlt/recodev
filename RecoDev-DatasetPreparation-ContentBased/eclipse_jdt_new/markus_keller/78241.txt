I have this trivial class.

% cat Test.java
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Test
{
       public static void logInfo(final Logger log, final String msg, final 
Throwable exception, final Object ... params) {
       }
}

When I select Alt-Shift-C (change method signature) the final arg params shows 
up as Object[] - which is a little confusing.

However if I delete the last argument and add one back in I can't enter 
Object... and if I enter Object[] I get an Object[] parameter not an Object... 
parameter.  I am not able to enter Object... (but expected I should be able to).

1.5 is still work in progress so don't expect anything to work yet.
Fixed for I20050201.
