Steps to reproduce:

1. Open New JUnit Test Case Wizard (NewTestCaseCreationWizard)
2. See, that tearDownAfterClass() checkbox is enabled.
3. FAIL Click on any checkbox in "Which method stubs would you like to create?" section -> tearDownAfterClass() checkbox turns disabled.

I think that this is not desired behavior.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=3480fe97ea7e60b7426af1fed1a0f9554f445fdb
Fix is not good. tearDownAfterClass() must always be enabled for a JUnit 4 test. The real bug is the SelectionButtonGroupListener, which should be deleted, along with all the other unused code in MethodStubsSelectionButtonGroup.

Sorry, my bad. I only looked at the existing code/logic and assumed it's OK.
Reverted previous change and fixed as outlined in comment 2: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=6bde9dc4aed38b472a7a3c441472adde54a97acd

I've also reverted bad changes from bug 335224: When the user switches between JUnit 3 and 4, we have to uncheck the buttons that get disabled, and we must not create the respective method stubs.
