Since I run around using 'organize imports' to turn all those stars into
specific imports, shouldn't this import the specific class instead of *? 
Perhaps some sort of configuration option for this would be appropriate.

move could be smarter and import only stuff that's needed
We should try to get rid of the .* import. How difficult is it ?
reassigning to you Markus, i heard that you'll be rewritting that code at some 
point soon
refactoring the imports seems to be a more general problem

it occurs at move method (old imports not deleted) and 
at inline method (new imports not added)

and at some more places (I do not remember at the moment),
e.g. import xx.yy.* instead of xx.yy.ZZ;
