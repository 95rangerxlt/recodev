Through the bug 371968, a popup was added to warn about lesser compiler setting than the setting for null annotation based analysis.
I am getting this popup even if the 'Enable annotation-based null analysis' is turned off. 
I am using I20120306-0800.

Thanks for the bugs. I also added highlights to the options that are about to be changed when the dialog is up.
