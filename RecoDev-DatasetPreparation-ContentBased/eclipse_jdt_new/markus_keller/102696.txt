Must manually update the comment
Move to JDT/UI
This seems to be fixed. Tested with the following snippet:

/**
 * 
 */
public void foo() {
	System.out.println(var);
}

The only problem I see in this case is the order of the linked positions. The current order is:
* Javadoc param name
* Sysout
* javadoc param description
* param type
* param name

It feels a bit jumpy as the "javadoc param description" should be the next after "javadoc param name".

The original problem still exists in I20090818-0800, since TypeChangeCorrectionProposal does not add the @return tag here:

class Bug {
	public void foo() {
		boolean b = addUser("a");
	}

	/**
	 * Bla.
	 * 
	 * @param user u
	 */
	static void addUser(String user) {

	}
}


> order of the linked positions

I've fixed that in HEAD, but a bit differently. The place with the error should always be the first in the sequence, so I changed it to:
* Sysout
* Javadoc param name
* javadoc param description
* param type
* param name
Fixed original problem in HEAD.

Example:
class Bug {
	public void foo() {
		boolean b = addUser("a");
	}

	/**
	 * Bla.
	 * @param user u
	 */
	static void addUser(String user) {

	}
}

Markus, seems you forgot to close this one. Or is there anything left to do?

Indeed, I forgot to close this. Thanks for spotting it.
