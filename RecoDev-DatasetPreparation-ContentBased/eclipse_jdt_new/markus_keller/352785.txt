If I attempt to Refactor > Extract Method which includes a break statement inside a switch, an unexpected exception occurs, which is an NPE (will attach stack later).

It should give an error which says something like you can't refactor a method which includes multiple exit points, or something like that.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write some code:
   public void foo(int i) {

    	switch (i) {
    	case 1:
         	if (true) {
        		break;
        	}
    	}
} 

2. Highlight the some code within the case 1 statement.

3. Choose Refactor > Extract Method
