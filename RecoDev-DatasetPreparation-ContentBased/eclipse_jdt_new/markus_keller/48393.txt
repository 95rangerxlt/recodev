Please provide a refactoring to inline a constant (final static field).
Select the final field and execute inline refactoring. That should do the 
trick.
Oh, I see. It only doesn't work on a specific usage of the field:

public class Test {
  public static final String CONST = "const";
  public void test() {
    System.out.println(CONST);
    // try to inlin here ^
  }
}

I get the message "can't inline method since it is declared in a class file". 
Seems as if Eclipse (3.0M5) tries to inline println instead of CONST.
Markus, can you please have a look.
