(Follow up from Bug 297449)

Reproducible: Always
The only minor issue I see, is that when pasting a snippet into a *.jar we get a dialog that paste cannot be done but when pasting over a library node it creates the elements for the snippet in a new project. We should either
1. do the same in both cases
2. prevent pasting (show dialog) or create the snippet elements in the parent 
   project (not create a new project)
I'll prevent pasting into library nodes.

We won't disable the Paste action, since we never know when the clipboard changed an I don't want to risk getting into situations where the command would work but is not enabled.
Fixed in HEAD.
