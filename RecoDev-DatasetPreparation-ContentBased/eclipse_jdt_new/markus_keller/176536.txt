To reproduce:
 - create 2 java projects AProj and BProj
 - in AProj create an interface IFace in a non-default pkg
 - export AProj to a jar (AProj.jar)
 - add AProj.jar in the build path for BProj
 - in BProj create a new Class that implements IFace in the same pkg as IFace
 - in BProj rename the package

 - the import for IFace should be added to the implementation since the interface and the implementation are now in different packages.

Fixed in HEAD. We were skipping class files while gathering potential types to import.
