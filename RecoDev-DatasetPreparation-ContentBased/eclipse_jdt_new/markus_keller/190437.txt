The '<' and ' ' terminator in open type don't filter anymore.
Major Regression.

Test Case:
1. type "Hash"
2. type "<"
==> also shows "Hashtable" which is wrong.

Mmmh. It works as designed as that is the beginning of a camel-case hunk and we not only allow e.g. HM but also HMa, HMap etc.

So - I guess for 3.3 we have to live with that. For 3.4 we might want to offer a terminator (e.g. '!') that ensures that only classes are listed that exactly match the string in front of the terminator.
I think we should not introduce a third terminator. If we really need 2 versions (one for exact, and one for camelCase & exact), then I would split it up between the existing terminators.
This issue should be fixed while fixing bug 124624 as now bug 176017 is fixed...

See the full explanation in bug 124624 comment 8 about this issue, but to summarize, I do think that neither an extra character nor 2 versions are needed in this case...

"Hash<" should only return exact matches as there's only one uppercase (means that the pattern is not a real camel case in fact), although "HMap<" should return 'HashMap' but not 'HtmlMapper'...

So, IMO, I would put this bug as a duplicate of bug 124624...

(In reply to comment #3)
I basically agree. Let's have the implementation discussion in bug 124624.

We should keep this for the necessary changes in JDT/UI.
