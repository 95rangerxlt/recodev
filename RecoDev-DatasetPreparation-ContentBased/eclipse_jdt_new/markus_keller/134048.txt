- create to classes 'A' extending 'C'. Both classes without members
- open 'A' in type hierarchy and editor
- on 'A' in type hierarchy open refacting context menu: nu pull up/push down
- add a method in the editor and save.
- open context menu on 'A' in type hierarchy again: still no pull up
- change selection in hierarchy to 'C' and back to 'A'
- open context menu on 'A' in type hierarchy again: pull up available

It seems that there's some enablement cache that's only updated on selection change.

Fixed in RefactorActionGroup.

The enablement state is calculated on selection state change. The editor quick menu already recalculated enablement before the menu is openend - added same for object quick menu and submenu in context menu.
