3.3 RC4 (like this since day one)

1. start fresh workspace
2. verify on Java > Installed JREs that a JRE is installed and selected
3. press Ctrl+Shift+T or click the enabled 'Open Type' tool bar button
4. try to find a class from the JRE, e.g. HashMap
==> nothing.

We should either allow to select the types from the installed JRE, disable the command or bring a dialog that tells novice users what to do (similar to the new wizard actions that suggest to create a new Java project).

We could show a dialog, 'Create a project first'.
Added project creation prompt like in new type actions.
