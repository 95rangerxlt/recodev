We are going to move IElementCollector to org.eclipse.ui.progress in M9 so 
please update your imports accordingly in DeferredMethodWrapper .

The org.eclipse.ui.progress.IElementCollector currently extends 
org.eclipse.jface.progress.IElementCollector but this dependency will be 
severed in M9 and the jface version will be deleted.

Tod, can you be a little bit more specific. I looked in build I20040420 and 
there isn't any org.eclipse.ui.progress.IElementCollector class.

Markus, the class is used in call hierarchy. Can you please adapt the code as 
soon as we know what to do.
I released it to HEAD yesterday so you won't see it until the 0421 nightly 
build - sorry should have been clearer.
Turns out I was wrong - my interim solution will not handle this - I am going 
to have to delete IElementCollector from jface and add it to ui.

I would like to do this before the end of April - Markus let me know when I 
can do this with you to prevent a broken nightly build.
Changes have been released.
DeferredMethodWrapper is updated in HEAD.
