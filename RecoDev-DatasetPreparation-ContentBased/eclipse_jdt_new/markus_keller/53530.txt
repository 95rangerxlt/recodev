Hi Jesper. What do you think about changing the second column header in the
Location View to "Line" and dropping the prefix "line " from the table cells?

This would allow to make the column narrower (the repeated "line " is not really
interesting).

Patch changing the header of the Location column

Hi Markus,

I think that sounds like an excellent idea. I've never really liked the "line"
prefix (which seems pretty obvious).

I've made a patch implementing your suggestion.
Thanks, released the patch.
