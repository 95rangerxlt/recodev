*** Bug 263249 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Another example that fails:

	void m(InputStream is) throws Exception {
		m(new Zipnew FileInputStream("a"));
	}

- content assist after 'new Zip'
=> ZipInputStream should be first choice (as in 3.4.1)
=> proposal should be inserted
In order get what's described in comment 1, the following import has to be added:
import java.util.zip.ZipInputStream;

Fixed in HEAD.
