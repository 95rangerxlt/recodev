Suppose there is a method
void foo (String []);

if in some place you want ivoke the method creating the array on fly, and 
suppose to type something like:
foo (new String [] {"x"})

automatic parentheses and curved brackets insertion makes your code looking as
foo (new String [] {<cursor here>)
}
i.e closing curved bracket goes out of the method parameter parentheses...
