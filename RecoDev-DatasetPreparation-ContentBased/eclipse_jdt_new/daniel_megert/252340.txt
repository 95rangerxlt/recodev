fix

.
Didn't use the patch. Made some more changes and did not fix this:

	 * <strong>Note:</strong> If an option gets changed in the UI then this must immediately update
	 * the corresponding option in the here given clean up options.

I think "in" is more clear than "of" in this case as an option Iin the given options map needs to be updated.


Fixed in HEAD.
