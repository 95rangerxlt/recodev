Build 200311211210 (3.0M5) on Window XP Home edition

When I hover over methods in the Java editor, the method's Javadoc popup is
displayed so that the font changes from bold to plain and vice-versa in
mid-word. For example, the "Parameters" heading should be all in bold, but
actually "mete" is in plain. This doesn't happen for classes' Javadoc popups. I
will attach a screenshot of the problem.

One possible test case is MultiPageEditorPart.
Might be caused by the changes in TextPresentation

Released a first fix for I20031125 which restores the previous behavior for the
range iterators and makes a copy when getting the default style range.

To fix a bug in the original implementation (returning a copy for ranges that
cross the window border) we will have to ensure that copies made in
createWindowRelativeRange(...) are also added to the TextPresentation's data
model and that corresponding indexes and methods (e.g. getDenumerableRanges())
are correct.

Create bug 49818 for the border problem and marking this one as fixed.
