I20060919-0010, same in 3.2

Most navigation and selection commands don't work in the class file editor:
- 'Edit > Select All' (Ctrl+A) is enabled, but does not do anything
- 'Edit > Expand Selection To' actions are enabled, but just show a dialog
- Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Shift+Left, Home, Ctrl+Home, Shift+Home, and their equivalents with Right/End don't work

Only those keys supported by the OS widget are supported.
There are currently plans to support the 'Text Editing' navigation commands. 
Well, actually less is supported because those commands are in fact bound by the class file editor with source but those actions don't work in the 'no source' case.

We could deregister all the actions and register them again once source gets attached.

Compared to R3.2 at least [Shift +] PageUp/Down work.
*** Bug 157829 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Let me see whether there's an easy fix for that.
>- 'Edit > Expand Selection To' actions are enabled, but just show a dialog
No plans to fix that.

Fixed all other cases.
