Build: 20020328

Description:
I tried to do a search for references to getPattern() in the hierarchy of 
JavaSearchPage and got the following dialog:

Caption:  Search: Found 1 Potential Patch
Text:     Strings matching your query were found but the corresponding type
          could not be resolved using the project's build path.

          Possible reasons are:
          -The build path and the execution class path are different and code on
          the build path references code on the execution class path.
          -The build path is incorrect.  E.g., a required JAR is not on the 
          build path.

I think the caption is supposed to be
Search: Found 1 Potential Match
