(1) Extension point schema:  org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javaCompletionProposalSorters

* The root extension element specifies that only one "proposalSorter" element
  is allowed; however, in practice, one or more "proposalSorter" elements are
  allowed.

* This type of minimum / maximum element occurrence violation was detected in 
  the following Eclipse SDK plug-ins:

  -> org.eclipse.jdt.ui

(2) Extension point schema:  org.eclipse.jdt.ui.quickFixProcessors

* The "quickFixProcessor" element requires one "enablement" element; however,
  in practice the "enablement" element may be omitted.

* This type of minimum / maximum element occurrence violation was detected in 
  the following Eclipse SDK plug-ins:

  -> org.eclipse.jdt.ui
  -> org.eclipse.jdt.junit

Please see attached patch and feel free to let me know of any questions or
concerns
