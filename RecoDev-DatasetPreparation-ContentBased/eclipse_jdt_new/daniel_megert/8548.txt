Version: 2.0
Build: 20011219

An string once externalized leaves the coding looking like
	WorkbenchMessages.getString("Save_Resource"), //$NON-NLS-1$
The problem is that when reading the code one has no idea what the string is 
(without tracking it down elsewhere).

Is there any way that some flavour of hover assistance could indicate the 
string?

Or alternatively have some like F3 open the message catalog file & position me 
at the string. This lets me see it & edit it if I want to.

A work around is to include the original string in the comment at the right of 
the line but that's too fragile because it will not be up to date as messages 
catalogs get edited.

still a problem in 2.0.

The hovering solution showing the translated string for the current locale 
would be cool. It could be implemented with some scanning when users follow the 
convention to name the properties file after the bundle accessor class.

no action planned without external contribution
Ctrl+Click now opens the properties file and a hover shows the value.
Remaining issues:
- Open (F3) should open the properties file (P2)
- make it work for class files (P3)

Fixed in HEAD. In builds > 20041112.
Navigation with Ctrl+Click is now possible. Open (F3) is covered by bug 78522.
