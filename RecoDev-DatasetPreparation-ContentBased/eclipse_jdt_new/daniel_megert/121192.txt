1. Open Java Browsing perspective
2. Add the following type:
public class X {
	{
	}
	X() {}
}
3. In the Member view, attempt to select the initializer
Observe: The selection is cleared from the Member view and the initializer is not selected in the Java editor

If you remove the constructor, then it works.
It also works in the Outline view.

Moving to JDT UI to investigate
Nice try ;-)

The initializer is a source ref but getSourceRange() returns null.
Thanks Dani. I moved it to you since it worked in the Outline view. So it looks like the Outline view doesn't use getSourceRange().
I'll investigate.
Ah, I now see what you mean: the selection in the editor works i.e. the caret is at the correct location and the magnet is correct as well but the selection in the Members view is not kept. Also backlinking is not working.
The range was null because I had compile errors in the file.
Fixed in HEAD.
