I've defined 2 inner classes, but only 1 is shown in the Outline view. With the
2  nested classes shown below, only DBChoice is displayed under the
HearingFeedback class in the Outline:

public class HearingFeedback extends Action  {

  class DbAnswer {
		int question_d;
		String answer_text;
		String answered;
		ArrayList choices;
    	
		DbAnswer() {
			// no-arg constructor
		}
    	
		DbAnswer(int question_id, String answer_text, String answered) {
			this.question_d = question_id;
			this.answer_text = answer_text;
			this.answered = answered;
		}
	} // End of DbAnswer

  class DbChoice {
	  int choice_id;
	  String selected;
      
	  DbChoice() {
		// no-arg constructor
	  }

	  DbChoice(int choice_id, String selected) {
		  this.choice_id = choice_id;
		  this.selected = selected;
	  }
	} // End of DbChoice

strange: i see both, DbAnswer and DbChoice
which build are you using?
anyting in the log?
are these the exact classes you have the problem with (modifiers might play a 
role here)?
probably related to bug 36992
