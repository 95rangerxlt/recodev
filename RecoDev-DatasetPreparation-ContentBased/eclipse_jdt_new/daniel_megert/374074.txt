Build Identifier: 

If I copy some text(for example - charAt), then go to the class(say String), then I want to go to that method, so I type ctrl+O, paste the text(charAt) in the textbox, then type enter. 

This will not work - nothing happens.

If I move the up and down key, then enter tyoe, it will go to that method.
Of course there are many other ways to navigate to a method - for example we can type charAt in the outline view.

This is a very very small issue, but if Eclipse can fix this, it would be a little better : )

Reproducible: Always

I cannot reproduce this using 3.8 M5 on Windows 7.

1. copy "charAt" into clipboard
2. open type String
3. Ctrl+O
4. Ctrl+V
   ==> dialog filters and shows charAt(int)
5. press 'Enter'
==> charAt(int) is selected

Maybe you have some mouse or keyboard settings that make this not work?
In the last step, if press "enter" key in the right number pad, it will not work. - if I move up and down using the arrow key, then press enter in the right number pad, it works.

If press enter key in the middle, it does works.

I used eclipse 3.7.1.r37x_v20110729.
Thanks for the details. Good catch!
