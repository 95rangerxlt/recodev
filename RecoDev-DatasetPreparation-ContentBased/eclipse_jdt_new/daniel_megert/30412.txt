Build: I20030122

I have the java browsing perspective open.  I selected a package in the packages
view, and there was an error trying to open the type browsing view.  I can't
seem to reproduce it, but hopefully the stack trace will be useful.  The result
was that the types view could not be initialized (the view contained an error
message saying it could not be created.

Log file showing stack trace
There are two major problems here
a) one is caused by the fact that rt.jar is shared (in the Java Model). You can
see this when you check an element below the rt.jar: it will select and gray
check one of your projects but most likely not the parent.
b) the CheckBoxTreeViewer does not support equal elements in the tree - it gets
totally confused however all corresponding rt.jar children are equal.

Also note that if you click OK it will work.

Would have to totally rewrite the page from CheckBoxTreeViewer to Tree.

Most likely after 2.1


Comment should have gone to another PR.

Test Case:
1. Switch to Java Browsing perspective
2. Select a logical package in the Packages view
3. Close (if not yet closed) the Types view
4. Reopen the Types view
==> CCE

Fixed.
