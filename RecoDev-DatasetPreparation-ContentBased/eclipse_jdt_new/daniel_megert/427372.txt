+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #427371 +++

I still see this in a few places. This is an old "update manager" image that has not been used since p2 was introduced. 

Besides removing the image, the file name should be removed from build.properties, if mentioned there.

./rt.equinox.framework/features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable.feature/eclipse_update_120.jpg

Marking as 'minor', since is "merely cleanup" ... but, I think important. 

(I was reminded of this, seeing it as part of the "deltapack" zip file).

I assume this bug is only for
