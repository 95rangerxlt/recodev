I use a 17' Display at 1024*768. To see all my lines at once i have moved the 
outline view under the package view.

In my medium size project i have at the moment about 20 packages. Now i want to 
move quickly through my classes, it's a lot of scrolling and clicking, as i 
have to open the package, it's classes appear, a linked class is about 3 
packages further down ... . It's very slow to get my classes in editors. I use 
at most ctrl+shift+t with F3|F4, so i'm happy. But navigation in packages is 
too hard.
A solution could be the old view in VAJ.

or a tree like view of the packagages. I would prefer the VAJ style, as tree 
structurs is to space consuming (horizontal), if the tree is a little bit 
deeper and there is also a lot of mouse clicking.

we are working on a non-tree based package browsing. It is targeted arond M3.
Let us know if you want to be an early adopter and try it out before we release 
it.
I would be pleased to try it out. Good to hear that you think about a 
better|other solution too.
A own browsing perspective could be nice. There are a lot of ways to look at 
source-code.
Martin,
a first cut of the Java Browsing views is now part of the drop. I suggest you
wait for todays build because I20020212 has several problems.
Feedback appreciated.

ok to close?
Sorry short on time, 
Ok to close!
Solved by new Java Browsing perspective and its views.


Package view to complex with many packages, tree structure or cut off classes could help
