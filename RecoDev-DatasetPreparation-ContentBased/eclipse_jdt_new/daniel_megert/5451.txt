oops, just noticed the 'remove filter menu entry'
i assume that it is just a workaourd for sth - not the final solution.

because it is highly counter-intuitive that i have to select another menu entry 
in order to uncheck the one i want to 
yes, the current UI can't be final answer.

The working set selection dialog should provide an option to "unapply" a 
working set. This is different from remove. Currently unselecting a working 
set disables the OK button. Apply/unapply could be done via a checkbox list.

Dani pls comment


The currently selected working set is now visible.
Discussed with EG not to chnage the dialog into a checkbox list - Packages view 
will provide its own filter dialog.

Suggest to close.
