RC2

In the process of "just working'.  Renaming Java projects and contained java 
packages and classes I eventually go an error that a particular "path" could 
not be found and a bunch of stuff in my .log file.

After all this the source folder in the refactored Java project is no longer a 
source folder.

I will work on steps to reproduce but can not get to it until after I to the 
copyright updating.  For now I will give you the general flavour of what I was 
doing and I will attach my .log file.

1) I had a Java project that was orignally created with the New Project Plugin 
Development - > Plug-in Project wizard (plug-in with a popup menu).

2) Several days development in this project under an older (pre RC2 build.  
Probably RC1).

3) Delete everything in Eclipse directory except Workspace
4) Unzip RC2.
5) Do more work in project
6) Refactor project doing the following:
      a) Refactor-Rename project
      (Noticed oddnesss is a Meta-Inf folder was created in new place
7) Renamed several classes in the project.
8) Deleted the Meta-Inf folder as uninteresting.  Just one simple text file in 
it.
9) Renamed some more classes.

On a class rename got an error dialog stating it could not find the class and 
output sent to .log.

.log file
Unclear how the source folder disappears. But I think it is caused by an 
exception, although ai can't find one in the log.

The not present exceptions in the log are caused by the search result view. I 
guess it displayed element which are now no longer Java elements since the 
source folder disappeared.

Asking Daniel for commenting.

Overall I think it is not critical for 2.1 since we don't loose source folders 
in normal cases. 
The log from search is OK. Probably caused by the unexpected removal of the
source folder which wasn't reported in a delta.
Daniel, why do we lock the error if we have to deal with the case that search 
result entries are Java elements anymore?
Dirk, what did you want to express with your last sentence?
log? aren't anymore?
I got the feeling that it can happen that the element represented by a search 
result entry might not be a Java element when refreshing the view. So logging 
not present exception might not be the right think to do.

Sorry for the confusion.
Daniel, can you please comment and dispose PR if you feel that logging the not 
present exception is the right thing to do here.
Investigating
Changed Search to longer log doesNotExistExceptions in this situation. This is
needed because the refresh of the view can happen before the element is actually
removed.
