I would like to change "left" to "right" within a selected range of text only.

Currently, there seems to be a bug with invoking Find/Replace with selected
text.  As you press Find/Replace on the dialog, the found text is not
highlighted or selected. Instead, the previous selection range is maintained.
The result is that replacements are made which are hard to see and could be
unintended.

This works for me in I20050420-1200 by using the 'Selected Lines' scope. Please
provide a more detailed scenario that does not work for you.
Try pressing the incremental button (Find/Replace) instead of Replace All.  The 
dialog beeps as if it did nothing, but it continues to replace text outside of 
the selected range.
This is a good catch!

[find/replace] Clicking Replace/Find button goes beyond scope
