Was hard to reproduce: the problem appears if the Search view contains results
which disappear during the refactoring.

It seems that the global event distributor stops distributing if a component
throws an exception. Therefore the renamed package sometimes doesn't appear.

I guess the trick where I handle the case of non-existing working copies is
somehow broken by the new CombinedLabel stuff that workbench introduced. Not
sure though.

This is a must fix.

Sometime rename in Projects and Packages view removes the element even if no
search markers are there.

Dani pls investigate who is causing this problem.
The errors in the log are cause by renaming a CU.
This is an old unsolved problem:
  Bug 3601: Can't handle rename of resource (1GCE1EI)
Added a (dirty) workaround for the problem: patching the J Core handle identifier.

Leaving open for investigation of project/package rename problem.

Fixed rename problem in Java Browsing perspective


Problem in Search/Decorating labelproviders - was: Java Browsing: Package disapears after rename



Added workaround for 3601: Can't handle rename of resource (1GCE1EI) Trigger was PR 13325 saying there are errors in the log.
