Build Identifier: M20100909-0800

When I try to rename my project from "project1" to "Project1" using rightclick->refactor->rename, I get the error "A folder with that name already exists". I have to first change it to something else like "proj1" and then back to "Project1".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new java project name "project1"
2. Refactor the project name to "Project1"
3. Will see the error in the dialogue box not letting you continue.

Is this fix also applicable to classes? For years, I've encountered this bug on Windows if I were to rename, for example, Foreach.java to ForEach.java

No, that case got fixed long time ago.
