I'm trying to spot some performance bottlenecks in code completion. On my experiments I found an issue that may be worth evaluating for Eclipse Mars.

I noticed that creating AnonymousTypeCompletionProposals is rather slow. It seems that computing the image of the proposal in the constructor is the culprit. See the attached screenshot for details.


How do you feel about computing the image of such a proposal lazily?

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=54fd61973f8240190cfdc4e50eb7bb4a49805da4


You might also want to check whether #isAnnotation and #isInterface are hotspots.
