build I20031023

- in a Java editor, press Ctrl+O
- the outline prompter appears
- using Alt+Tab, switch to another window
- using Alt+Tab, switch back to the Eclipse window
- notice that, before releasing the last Alt+Tab, the caption in the Windows 
switcher is blank
- it switches back to the Eclipse Window, and the outline prompter is still up

The outline prompter also stays up when I do other things, e.g.:
- drop down the list under the Run toolbar item
- choose the last launch from this list

In the editors drop-down, I basically stole the code from JDT, but changed it 
so that it deactivates when the shell gets an SWT.Deactivate event.  This seems 
to avoid the problems above.

In Text, the default Closer in AbstractHoverInformationControlManager hooks 
lots of events on the subject control.  Would using SWT.Deactivate allow you to 
avoid this, or are there other reasons for having to track events in the editor 
(e.g. are there information presenters that don't actually take focus, and 
therefore don't fire an event when focus changes?)

can reproduce using I20031104.
I can still reproduce it using I20031105 (on WinXP this time).

Yes of course - the bug is still open :-)

Sorry, I thought you said "can't".
