MultiTypeSelectionDialog.computeResult calls MessageDialog.openError when
processing a JavaModelException. As it has a Status to display it
should use ErrorDialog which will display a status as well.

Same issue in TypeSelectionDialog
pls check with Claude before releasing
You should also look for all senders of MessageDialog.errorDialog within JDT - 
there are several others with the same issue and the change is low risk.
Check all calls and replaced when possible.

Fixed for build > 20020531
pls verify
the following classes still have this problem:
OpenJarPackageWizardActionDelegate
TemplateProposal


btw, when MessageDialog.openError is used to display an error message
should we check if the exception has an IStatus (is of type CoreException) and
use ErrorDialog then? 
if the answer is yes - then still we have to fix quite a few places
Any exception that provides an IStatus should be reported to the user using an 
ErrorDialog rather than a MessageDialog.
Classes that deal with exceptions when opening a MessageDialog are
  JavaContext
  LinkedPositionUI

Classes that deal with InvocationTargetException which may wrap an 
CoreException): 
   AddMethodStubAciton, 
   AddImportOnSelectionAction, 
   JavaAddElementFromHistoryAciton
   AddUnimplementedConstructorAction
   OverrideMethodsAction
whenever possibl we should show the user the IStatus information. Tagging as F3 
candidate
reopen
Fixed

cannot verify:

AddGetterSetterAction
AddJavaDocStubAction
JavaAddElementFromHistory
more explanation
AddGetterSetterAction:
line 393 - calls showError and uses the incorrect dialog for 
InvocationTargetException (should look inside at the target exception)
line 152 - calls showError with a core exception and displays the incorrect 
dialog
line 360 - same

AddJavaDocStubAction
147 -  calls showError with a core exception and displays the incorrect dialog
185 -same
200 - same as 393 in AddGetterSetter...

JavaAddElementFromHistory
182 - same problem as 393 in AddGetterSetterAction

Rest will be fixed after 2.0
