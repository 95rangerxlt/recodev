Dear Javadoc view,

  I was pleased the first time you warned me about the lack of an HTML widget on my platform. 
However, now that you've told me about it 100 times, I think it's time you and I stop talking about this 
problem.

   Thanks,
      Jared

Fully agree ;-)

Don't you have mozilla installed? If so, you should file a bug against SWT and
report that it's not working with your setup.
