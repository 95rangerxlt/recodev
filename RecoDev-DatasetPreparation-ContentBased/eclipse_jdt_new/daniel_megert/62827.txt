On the hover pref page I found the following sentences a bit irritating
- Description of the 'Combined Hover': Tries the hovers in the order listed below.
There's nothing below this text. Which order? I also would expect to change this
order.
- Enable annotation roll-over (on new editor)
  -> (on newly opened editors)

On the hover pref page I found the following sentences a bit irritating
- Description of the 'Combined Hover': Tries the hovers in the order listed below.
There's nothing below this text. Which order? I also would expect to change this
order.
- Enable annotation roll-over (on new editor)

Fixed the two strings.

The order is given by the plug-in dependency. There are future plans to allow
you to setup this hover which will then get another name.
starting to verify.
"Tries the hovers in the sequence listed in the table below this one". 
That reads as "in the table below this one". There still isn't a table below the
description field (which isn't a table anyway). 

How about:

"Shows the hover which best fits the selected element and the current context.
The order in which the hovers are tried is the same as the order in the table
above."

For the second string I find Martin's suggestion better. We're not enabling the
rollover when we open an editor, we're enabling it now, and it will be used when
we open a new editor.

How about: 

 "Enable annotation roll-over (applies to newly opened editors)"

I don't think the original complaint is completely adressed.

first item: good suggestion
second one: wontfix (same pattern everywhere)
Removing target milestone, no further action for 3.0.
This has been fixed recently.
