This will be a nice test for our scripts. I improved the Javadoc in 
org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring.history.IRefactoringHistoryControl. The auto-tag script should detect this and tag the bundle during the next I-build.

Fixed in master: 753aa8631e811e27271e75a7220f378b6a4e9fe5


ltk.ui.refactoring bundle needs to be tagged
