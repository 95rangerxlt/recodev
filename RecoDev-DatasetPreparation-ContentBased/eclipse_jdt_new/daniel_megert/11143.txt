We are currently using a duplicate version of the AddBookMarkAction provided by 
the workbench. The duplication is no longer required since the 
AddBookMarkAction is now IResource adapter aware. Please adapt the Browser 
views and remove the action from the packageexplorer package.

(notice I did the changes in the PackageExplorerPart, but wasn't yet able to 
release them)

I adapted the browsing package but did not remove the action since the
PackageExplorerPart is not yet released.

Waiting for EG to release the changes before deleting the action.
Removed the action since EG has released the changes



Use the workbench provided AddBookMarkAction
