Confirmed on both 2.1 (build ID 200303272130) and I20030528 (build ID 200305280800).

If you set the Code Assist auto activation delay to zero (Window > Preferences >
Java > Editor > Code Assist > Auto activation delay) then code assist will
refuse to use hovers. Javadoc for methods will not show, nor with templates give
an indication of what they are about to insert. Setting the auto activation
delay to any value greater than 0 restores hover functionality.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Eclipse with a new workspace.
2. Create a Java project named "Test".
3. Create a class within the "Test" project named "Main".
4. Within the body of class Main, type "main"<ctrl-space>. A popup will appear
showing the template named "main", and next to the popup will be a hover that
contains "public static void main(String[] args) { }".
5. Close the editor open on class Main and decline to save changes.
6. Set the code assist auto activation delay to zero in the preferences.
7. Open class Main in the Java editor and try step 4 again. This time there will
be no hover containing "public static void main(String[] args) { }".
