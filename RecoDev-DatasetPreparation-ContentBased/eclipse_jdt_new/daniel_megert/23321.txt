Build 200209031019

The 'Hide anonymous inner class files' filter hides all inner class files. It 
should be renamed to 'Hide inner class files'.

Note that just hiding anonymous class files is not sufficient for me. I want to 
hide all innner class files since I can retrieve member classes by expanding 
the .class file.
