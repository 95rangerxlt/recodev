The bug can also be reproduced in non-segmented mode.

Was introduced after I20030129 - most likely by JavaElementComparator: replacing
JDT UI with the one from I20030129 fixes the problem, replacing it with JDT UI
from I20030205 (where the comparator was introduced) brings the problem back. No
changes were made in browsing code.

Note not all files produce the error. The following one does:

/*
 * Created on 11.02.2003
 *
 * To change this generated comment go to 
 * Window>Preferences>Java>Code Generation>Code Template
 */
package junit.ui;

public class TestRunner extends junit.awtui.TestRunner {
	void foo() {
	}
}

STRANGE: if the starting comment is removed the error does not show up!

There reason why it only shows up when there's a comment is caused by the back
linking from editor to the Members view: if valid Java element is at offset 0
then this element gets selected in the Members view causing the input to be a
type from a working copy.

The problem is caused by the JavaElementComparator because the Types view no
longer sends a selection changed and therefore the Members view does not get
informed that its input is a type from a working copy.

I could add additional code which handles types from working copy and CU as
equal but this does not fix all of the problems which were introduced with the
JavaElementComparer. For example the following test case is also broken by it:
Open the CU C with:
public class C {
	void f() {
	}
}
After the last } type: <RETURN>class T
==> T appears in Types view but Members view does not update. It did so in I20030129

NOTE: Disable "Link Java Browsing views selection to active editor" Java
preference to get rid of the selction event from the editor (which makes the
test case without comment work).

I added code which now actively updates the Members view independent of
selection changes.
