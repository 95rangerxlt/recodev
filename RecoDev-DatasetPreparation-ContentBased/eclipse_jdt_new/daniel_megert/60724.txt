1. Get a JOGL version from https://jogl.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList
2. Add the jogl.jar to a project.
3. Double click e.g. on net.java.games.jogl/GL.class
4. In about the middle of the class file editor, the content is clipped, and the
rest is gray. The content of the class file is correctly displayed in the
outline view.

We cannot download JOGL since it is not CPL or it would force us to ask for
lawyer permisson. Can you give us a test case with a CPL jar?

Did you attach source?

I suspect we are not getting the full information from J Core. Might the JAR be
corrupt?

What version of JOGL are you using?
I don't believe this is a problem in JDT.  This could be a UI limitation.
The class in question has 373505 characters with 10310 lines.  Somewhere 
around the 2500+ line mark, the StyledText goes gray.  The renderHeight in 
StyledText.handlePaint goes to 0 at this point.  You can scroll up a bit and 
then move the cursor down in the text which will scroll the file more.
Its quite confusing that the cursor and the scrollbar are not in sync but that 
is a separate issue.

Contents of the disassembled .class file (DEFAULT mode)

You can use this file (GL.txt) to reproduce the problem. The file has 8594
lines.
Is this new?  FH to investigate.
Works for me.
I open the file GL.txt in my Eclipse and I could see its full content.
Please, try it again with a newer version of Eclipse. Let me know if it helps ?
Using I200405060200 on WXP

I don't have a problem with GL.txt either.
However, when I view GL.class, not only is the original problem there but now 
page-up/page-down doesn't scroll.
I will attach a class file which can easily show the problem.  Open it with 
the Class File Viewer.  Don't use page-up/page-down but scroll down with the 
scroll bar, you should get to var1255 and then see the gray.
If you use page-down, then you will hit the bottom, however it will stop 
scrolling at var3757.  This may be a JDT-UI issue but I will let you decide.

With M8, I get the following:

GL.txt displays normally.

VeryLong.class doesn't display anything, except for the message which says there
is no source attachment. The background remains white.

GL.class has the symptomps I explained before. However, I can also scroll
*within* the StyledText using the cursor. I can see the whole content this way.

It's possible that the problem comes from how the ClassFileEditor composes the
UI elements.
Same here. Try to open VeryLong.class fail cause I don't have the source 
attached.
I'll reassign this to JDT-UI since StyledText can handle very large files 
normally.
Verified that we get the correct source from J Core.

Felipe,

we assume it's not a StyledText problem but rather a problem using
ScrolledComposite.

We use it as follows:

fScrolledComposite= new ScrolledComposite(parent, SWT.H_SCROLL | SWT.V_SCROLL);
fScrolledComposite.setAlwaysShowScrollBars(false);
fScrolledComposite.setExpandHorizontal(true);
fScrolledComposite.setExpandVertical(true);
<...>
StyledText styledText= createCodeView(composite);
data= new GridData(GridData.FILL_BOTH);
styledText.setLayoutData(data);
<...>
fScrolledComposite.setContent(composite);
fScrolledComposite.setMinSize(composite.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT));

The "real" code is in ClassFileEditor.SourceAttachmentForm
*** Bug 79146 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I still don't know how to reproduce this problem.
Do I need to open a large class file (with the source attached) using the 
Class file viewer and try to scroll it ?
Here are the steps:
1. create Java project 'JP'
2. create a class folder 'cf'
3. download https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=10381 as 'Long.class'
4. put 'Long.class' into 'cf'
5. open 'Long.class' via Navigator (you won't see it in the Package Explorer)
   ==> the file shows up in the Class File viewer and in the Outline view
6. use the mouse to scroll down via scroll bar
==> after some time the contents gets clipped

Thanks, I can reproduce this on Windows but not on GTK.
Okay, I understood the problem. The code using ScrolledComposite is having the 
size of the StyledText set to something too big, exceeding the platform limit.
On Windows the limit is 0x7FFF x 0x7FFF.
The code in ClassFileEditor would need to able to set the height of the 
StyledText to > 130000pixels  to work.

Moving back to JDT. You'll need to use a different implementation for 
scrolling in the class viewer.
Fixed in HEAD.
