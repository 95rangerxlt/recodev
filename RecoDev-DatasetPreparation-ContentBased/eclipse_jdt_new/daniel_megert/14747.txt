I think it would be a great idea if classes shown in the Java Browsing 
perspective would be decorated with the decorators used for the file 
decorations (in the navigator or packages view). This would by a way for i.e. 
Team Providers to give feedback on the class's state.

dani, please comment / prioritize
Note: This has nothing to do with the perspective itself but with the object
kind for which a decorator is contributed. The Package explorer does not show
decorators for classes (and members) either because the decorators are
registered for resources (files, folders and projects). If a decorator would be
registered for a type (or member) then it will appear since the Java Browsing
views are already instrumented.

Having said that, I think I understand what you would like to see and it targets
at the same direction as we intend to do for some actions: you would like types
to show the information (and menus) which you can see on a compilation units. Am
I right?


I could not have said it any better. You are 100 percent right.
