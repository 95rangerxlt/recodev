Assuming JPA annotation javax.persistence.OneToMany

If defining the cascade member on the annotation and the CascadeType is not already imported I am presented with 3 different CascadeType which provide no detail as to which is which.

javax.persistence.CascadeType
org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType
org.hibernate.metamodel.binding.CascadeType

I think the package name should be provided so that you can see which option you want to select and or limit to javax.persistence.CascadeType which is the only acceptable type for member cascade on javax.persistence.OneToMany

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add Annotation
2. Add member
3. See complete options

Note how it is not possible to know which is the desired javax.persistence.CascadeType from either the code complete suggestion or the info  popup
Cody, if you use content assist directly after the "=", it will only show the matching values.
