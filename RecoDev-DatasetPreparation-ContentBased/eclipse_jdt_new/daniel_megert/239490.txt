Build ID: I20080617-2000

Steps To Reproduce:
1.Create a plugin project working set.
2.Add a plugin project to this working set.
3.Create a Java project working set.
4.Add a Java project to this working set.
5.Try to add a plugin project working set -> Only Java project working sets are now allowed to be created! Where are the plugin project working sets now?
6. After here only Java project working sets are showed in the Package Explorer.

   What is a plugin project working set? Are you referring to "Plugins & Fragments"?
Yes, I mean a "Plugins & Fragments" working set.
Why should Package Explorer display Plugin & Fragments working set, which is from PDE? Package Explorer is from JDT, which doesn't know anything about it.
The Package Explorer should display a Plugins & Fragments working set because I can add a new one from the popup menu of the Package Explorer. But I can only add 1 and later I am not able to add another one anymore. 

So, either the Package Explorer displays all workings sets which I can add or it should be not possible to add Plugins & Fragments working sets in the Package Explorer.
JDT UI, I guess.

See "Assign to working sets" on the context menu of the package explorer and  View Menu->Select Working Set which appears only when the Top Level elements are Projects.

Prakash, could you please move this to JDT UI for comment. Thanks.

Which popup menu exactly?

Are you using 'Projects' or 'Working Sets' as top-level elements?

This seems to work just fine using R3.5.

What is working just fine in R3.5?
>What is working just fine in R3.5?
The Package Explorer has two modes:
1) Projects as top-level elements: here we support all available working set types
   and hence you can create them. The Plugins & Fragments working set also works
   here (of course you need to have the plug-in imported as binary).
2) Working Set as top-level elements: here the main focus is on Java and
   Resource working sets and hence we only allow to create those. In addition we
   are also able to show working sets that contain at least one element that
   adapts to an IProject.

We cannot (and do not want to) restrict the working set types for case 1 but for case 2 we only want to support a limited number of working set types, Java being the primary one, where we have know the element types and the parent/child relationship.
Ok I tried some combinations of working set types.

1. If you only have Java projects then everything if good in Package and Project Explorer
2. If you have Plugins/Fragments projects and a Plugins&Fragments working set then everything is almost fine in both views. In the Project Explorer it is shown as a "Plugins&Fragments" working set (indicated by the differnt icon), in Package Explorer all plugin/fragments are shown in the "Other Projects" working set.

The problem is when you add a Plugins&Fragments working set in the Project Explorer and then switch to the Package  then you see the Plugins&Fragments working set there as single entry with no child entries. If you then configure the working sets in the Package Explorer then this emtpy entry vanishes.

You see this if you open both views in parallel.


OK, I see what you mean. For 3.5 we added support to automatically show newly created working sets in the Package Explorer when in 'Working Sets' mode. That code misses to test for compatibility.
Fixed in HEAD.
