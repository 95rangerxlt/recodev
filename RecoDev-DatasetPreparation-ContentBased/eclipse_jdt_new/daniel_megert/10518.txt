Minor request.
I loaded my workspace with binary projects for the Eclipse platform to support 
the use of PDE and searches in the Eclipse Platform.  
I then decided that there were more projects than I could bear to stare at - but 
quickly found the working set filter.  

The filter is very nice to have, but if the decorators were shown in the working 
set selection dialog, it would make it much easier to select all but the binary 
projects.

The filter is very nice to have, but if the decorators were shown in the working 
set selection dialog, it would make it much easier to select all but the binary 
projects.
The better solution is to enable a filter for binary projects.
The packages view should provide extensible filters and PDE could then 
contribute a filter for binary projects.

This should be considered as part of the package filter rework.
Will consider it for the overall filter rework. However enhancing the working
set dialog to respect decorators is a good idea too.

Fixed and added new DCRs:
    Bug 11150: Extensible JDT filters
    Bug 11149Plug-in binary filter for Packages view


Feature request: Show the decorators in the package working set selection dialog
