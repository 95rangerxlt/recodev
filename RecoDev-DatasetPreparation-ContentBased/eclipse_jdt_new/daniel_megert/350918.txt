Try passing an 8 character applet parameter like 'foo'"Bar"  
to an applet using the eclipse debuging environment.   Or if you
are more adventurous, try some chinese text, such as 您好.

You won't get anything reasonable as the parameter value when you call
getParam

It may be the case that this is an ill-defined area in general, but
even so, if unexpected or unpredictable results are "expected" it would
be better not to allow GIGO


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
experiment with unusual applet parameters.

Can you add a test snippet/case?
the test cases are right there, use 'foo'"Bar" as a parameter
name, or 您好
the test cases are right there, use 'foo'"Bar" as a parameter
value, or 您好

But where do you pass it? Code? Launch Config? Variables view?
applet parameters in a launch config
The temporary HTML page is not correctly generated i.e. it does not encode special HTML characters.
Fixed in master: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=5915de3bdf921e09f7ef075a384585041068bf22


Note that for strings like 'foo'"Bar" we have to encode the quotes and since the applet viewer does not support most HTML stuff, this will appear as:
&#39;foo&#39;&quot;Bar&quot;

The 您好 case is fixed by using the same encoding to generate the page as specified in the applet launch configuration.
