The SmartTypingConfigurationBlock adds a property change listener to the 
JavaPlugin combined preference store. 

This listener is not removed --> results in leakage for each open close of the 
Java preference pages.

Test case:
Window>Preferences>Java>Editor

For each open close the state associated with the 
SmartTypingConfigurationBlock is leaked.

Remove the property change listener

Added a DisposeListener to force the removal of the PCL
Thanks for the patch. There was one removePropertyListener too much which I removed.

Also reviewed other occurrences where link ui is used in preferences.
