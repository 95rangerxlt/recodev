I20040113

I was typing inside a java editor.  Suddenly I got into a state where I was no
longer able to type anything.  Each keystroke would add another error to the log
file.  I was able to save the file without any problems.  When I closed and
reopened an editor on the same file, it still was causing errors on every
keystroke.  Typing in java editors on any other java file worked fine, but on
that particular file it always failed. After shutdown and restart the errors no
longer occurred. Log file is attached.
