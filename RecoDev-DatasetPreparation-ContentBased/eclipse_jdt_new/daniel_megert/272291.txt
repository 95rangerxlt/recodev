I20090414-0800.

The following two 'Compare With' menu entries are not intuitive:

1) Other Element...
- this action compares the selected elements with each other in a compare
  dialog that does not offer structure compare (see bug 75601)
  ==> 'Each Other...' would be a better name here
- also, the name rather suggests that I can select one element and then a dialog
  allows me to select some other element to compare with (during 3.5 Compare
  offered such a feature but took it out again, see bug 264498)

2) Each Other
- this action does not compare the selected elements with each other but instead compares the files of each selected element with each other in a compare editor
  ==> 'Each Others Files' might be a better choice
- users selecting e.g. two methods or fields would expect to use 'Each Other' but it's not available. Instead they have to use 'Other Element...'

Marking as potential 3.6 candidate. Changing this should be done early in the release cycle.
For 2) "Each Other" is OK and actually better than "Each Others Files".

To avoid the confusion, I've renamed "Other Element..." to "Each Other by Member".
