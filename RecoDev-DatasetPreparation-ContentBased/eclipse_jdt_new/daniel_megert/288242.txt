Each contributed completion proposal computer should be able to configure the internal collector that's used to compute the shared core context.

Workaround for clients is to compute their own core context:

CompletionProposalCollector collector= new CompletionProposalCollector(cu, true);
// configure the collector here
cu.codeComplete(getInvocationOffset(), collector);
collector.getContext();

Fix is simple: if a collector has been set to the context and if that collecter has a core context then we should always use that one.
Fixed in HEAD.
