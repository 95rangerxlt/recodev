Build id: I20091210-1301

1. Make a new Java project.
2. File > New > Class
3. Give it a name.
4. The warning says 'The use of the default package is discouraged.', that's fine.
5. Now in the source folder text field, change it from 'test/src' to 'test/' or 'test'.
6. Now the warning says 'Source folder is not a Java project.' even though 'test' really is a Java project. This is slightly misleading. The warning message should state that it is not a Java source folder or something of that sort.
