seems like they're only visible if you have the toolbar button 'show text hover'
pressed

which is reasonable, but some info about it on the pref page would be nice.
We should have an explanation similar to the one of the class path page.
Kai, can we remove the enable/disable button from the toolbar? Erich, Adam, Dirk
and I all agree on removing this button. What exactly is your scenario which
forces you to often use the button?
