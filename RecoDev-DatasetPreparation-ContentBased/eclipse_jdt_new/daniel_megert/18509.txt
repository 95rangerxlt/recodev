The Java Browsing type view does not show hints (!) on types when their 
compilation unit contains unused imports and the compiler is told to report 
them.

The end result is:
hints are shown in projects view, packages view and import declaration section 
of members view. So by clicking on a package with a !, I have no other option 
than to click on each class individually to see which one(s) are causing 
trouble.

Maybe the types view shouldn't be so strict about the distinction between CUs 
and types when it comes to this kind of thing.

By hints you mean error ticks.
The work around is to open the Task View (show on selected resource only).

we can't do more for 2.0, but the issue is understood.
Rendering those errors on a type can cause another glitch in the UI. Consider 
the case where "segemented view" is selected and the error on the type is an 
error generated by an import statement. Then opening the type only shows the 
type with no errors which is confusing as well.
Bothered me too. Since we show the imports of top level types in the Members
view we should also show CU problems on the top level types.

Changed summary.
Moving to MA to add option to problem label provider.
Martin please assign the PR to me when you're done.
Thanx.

I modified the ProblemsLabelDecorator so you can achieve what you want by 
subclassing it.
BrowsingProblemsLabelDecorator is such a subclass. I released it to the 
browsing package. Please see if it fits your needs.

Added the feature.
Released to HEAD (2.1)
