The stop/halt icon (used for unknown images) doesn't have the correct size and 
a search result including such an icon shows up incorrectly.

The icon should have the same width as the Java Element Labels with adornments.

We should also use a different icon (question mark, or just a grey sphere) in 
this case. The halt icon is too invasive.
