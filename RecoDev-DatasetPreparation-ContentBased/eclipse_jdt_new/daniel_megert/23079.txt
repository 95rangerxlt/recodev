Build 20020903

The label provider has an option to compress the package name (P_COMPRESSED).
This option is not applied to types and members.

Test Case:
1. Enable package fragment name compression
2. Search for declarations of a type or method which is not in the default package
==> the Search view should honor the package fragment name compression
