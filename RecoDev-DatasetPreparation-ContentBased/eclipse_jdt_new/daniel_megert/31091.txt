1) Open a java file that is not on the classpath (in SWT we have many of these 
because the code for other platforms is not included in the current 
classpath).  For example, get org.eclipse.swt from CVS and 
copy .classpath_carbon to .classpath.  Now open org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse 
SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.java.

2) Click on a method in the Outline view.  14 times a dialog pops up with 
title "Operation can not be performed" and message "The resource is not on the 
build path of a project.".  After the last dialog is closed, the Java editor 
scrolls to the requested method.

i saw 20-something :)
Dani, they are all caused by the Find* Actions. We should not check if the 
stuff is on the build path during seleciton change. Only before executing the 
operation.
Fixed.
