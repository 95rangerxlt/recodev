For each search result, the SearchEngine reports whether it is accurate or not (an inaccurate result being symptomatic
	of a problem with the classpath).

	We claim that we have an accurate search. However, in doubt (ie. if there is problem with the classpath), we report
	inaccurate results. The search view should show this information so that user doesn't blindly rely on the fact that
	we told her that the result was accurate.

NOTES:
EG (10.10.2001 22:01:42)
	there is a simple rendering in place.

The simple rendering puts ?: in front of non-exact matches.

Once this shows up we should check if the matches are really not exact or if 
they are a search engine bugs.
