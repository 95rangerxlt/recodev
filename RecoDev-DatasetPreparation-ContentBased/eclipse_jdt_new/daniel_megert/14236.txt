Using the 04/18 Integration build, I still can't get an info message into the 
status maintained by JarFileExportOperation. In my JarWriter implementation, 
the close() method is throwing a CoreException which contains a status whose 
severity is set to IStatus.INFO.
However, note that JarFileExportOperation.addToStatus() only accepts ERROR and 
WARNING (and only when they are being logged respectively which they are for my 
package data).

It's fixed. I added the preferences (log errors/warnings) from the
JarPackageData and missed the info. Don't know whether I should also add a
logInfo flag to JarPackageData. Would you need this?

Log error/warning is old stuff: the first JAR Packager allowed the user to
ignore warnings and errors but I then decided that this makes no sense.

Not sure I follow. You added the preferences and could add a logInfo if needed, 
but then say it's old stuff and makes no sense.
I agree that they make no sense (we set both to true and don't allow our users 
to change it). If you did provide a logInfo preference, we would simply hard 
code that to true as well. If we did anything, we would probably have our own 
preference based on whether you wanted to be informed of very specific messages 
(like setting the VM value in a specific XML file) rather than choosing to 
disable an entire class of messages.
logError/warning were part of the JarPackageData because they were used in the UI. 

If you also agree with me that they (and for completeness logInfo) are not very
useful then I tend to remove these 3 preferences from the API (JarPackageData).

It's ok by me to remove them. I would only ever set them to true if they remain 
part of the API.
Deprecated those methods.
They will be removed for the final 2.0
