I added several TODOs in org.eclipse.jdt.ui/component.xml, where I was not sure
about API restrictions. Could you please have a look?

P.S. For creating new component.xml files (for the other text plugins), you can
use these regular expressions:
- Copy api packages in the package explorer and paste them into a component.xml
- Replace all ...
(org.[.a-z]+)(\r\n)
... by ...
 <package name="$1">$2 </package>$2$2

- And the same for types:
^(\w+)\.java
   <type name="$1"/>

I've fixed this for M7.


check TODOs in jdt.ui's component.xml (JDT/Text API)
