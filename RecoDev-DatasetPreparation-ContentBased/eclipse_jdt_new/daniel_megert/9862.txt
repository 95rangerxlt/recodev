Build 20020212
This isn't a big problem,  I just wanted to report the behavior.  I discovered 
it in the new Java Browser perspective.

Set the number of editor pages to more than 1 (mine is set to 5).

Create a new .java file in one of your packages.  Delete the contents of the 
file so there is no package statement or class definition.  Save the file.  
This generates a compiler error that the declared package doesn't match the 
expected package and the class is removed from the Types view.

Select a different class in the Types view.  The editor will open on the 
selected class.  Reselect the class with no package/class definition, or double 
click on the error in a Task view.  The empty file is displayed, and the Types 
view is blanked out.

Reselect the package in the Packages view and the Types are redisplayed.

Something similar happens if you delete the class definition but leave the 
package statement in the file.

Fixed.
