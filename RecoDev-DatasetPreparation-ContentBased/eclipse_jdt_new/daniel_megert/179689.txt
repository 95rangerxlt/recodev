I have a user dictionary with less than 500KB contents, but SpellCheckEngine takes up more than 6MB at run time.
How do you know? Where is that used?

memory trace

Here's a trace with our internal org.eclipse.jdt.ui.spelling dictionary.

One source of inefficiency could be that AbstractSpellDictionary.hashWord(String) uses ArrayLists as map values, and many of the lists' arrays could be empty. If that's the case, a "compaction" pass after initial loading could help.
The dictionary in question almost has 50'000 words. Here's some statistics about the internal structure:

map size: 23146
ArrayLists with size 1: 14993
ArrayLists with size > 1 & < 4: 5813
ArrayLists with size > 4: 1683

The biggest gain (about 900k) can be made not creating an array list until we have more than 1 word. Another 58k can be saved by trimming the array lists. The first change requires some work as the getter "API" expects an array.
Fixed in HEAD.
