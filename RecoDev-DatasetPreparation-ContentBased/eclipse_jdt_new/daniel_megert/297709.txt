JDT frequencely synchronize the package tree when link with editor option opening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open some other class in editor, like Composite, SWT, Control and so on
2.new java class wizard, after completed, the editor should open the newly java file.
3.At this moment, the package tree change change and change again.

Do you see this in the Package Explorer or the Project Explorer (or both)?
Can you provide more detailed steps please.

Package Explorer.
Not known project explorer, ever long long time not used.
IMO, should be logic aspect at some times.
I reopen eclipse, try to repeat my reported steps,not again.
When encounter the before case, eclipse no any other logs.
Now only one most clear, 
the editor contains some other plugin class opened, new class wizard result,
let me see it very clear, from the opened class editor page in turn, 
at last reach the new class editor page.
> 5, sometimes, autocomplete result to same synchronize actions.
I guess that means that Content Assist (Ctrl+Space) also leads to change of selection in the Package Explorer. If that's the case, then you probably have a broken third-party plug-in installed.

> I reopen eclipse, try to repeat my reported steps,not again.
I guess this means that you cannot repeat the problem any more. Closing for now.

The Bug base has another bug report, new wizard lead to eclipse hang.
possible some other plugin responsible for it.
As you say, it's possible two.

If not any more, God will happy too:) I think my way not always so direct.
Before report this, I feeled, I think maybe some sands in my sight.
So I wait for the next:)
I think I got source of problem.

My workspace has projects, but includes two special projects:
1, normal java project AA.
2, plugin project which wrap AA project, AA.plugin.
I deploy the jar from AA to AA.plugin/lib.
3, some othere plugin depends AA.plugin.

so above before behaviors.
my last comment say it's still bug.
>2, plugin project which wrap AA project, AA.plugin.
What do you mean by "wrap"?

Sorry but I can also not reproduce. Please only reopen if you can provide concrete steps to reproduce i.e. list each step precisely, e.g. "select menu File > New > Class".

Now very clear for me. That so detail should too rundant*:)
OK, let's reproduce.
0, open link the editor option.
1, open AA java project, contains a class AA.class.BB.class
2, deploy the AA.jar to wrapped test.aa plugin project, 
the test.aa plugin contains lib AA.jar, which I mean "wrap". 
3, link AA.jar source to workspace AA java project.
4, Open AA.class, BB.class of test.aa plugin project in editor. should be java code in editor.
5, open AA java project AA.java, add some java code to modify it, 
6, do save action, At this moment, you should see the problem: the link target change to AA.class of test.aa plugin project.
>6, do save action, At this moment, you should see the problem: the link target
>change to AA.class of test.aa plugin project.
This does not happen for me using Eclipse SDK 3.6 M4 (http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.6M4-200912101301/index.php). As said before instead of writing prose text you should write exactly the steps you do in the UI.
You don't have to describe the steps to set up the projects. Please just:
- select the two projects that show the problem
- export them via 'File > Export > Archive File'
- attach the zip to this bug

Then describe the exact steps to reproduce (which file do you double-click, which button do you click, which keys do you press).

link with editor error behaviour bug example projects

0, prepare all projects, open package explorer, collapse all, and open link the editor option.
1, select test.BugA plugin project in package explorer, (such description enough?)
expand the project, 
click referenced libraries,expand,
click buga.jar,expand,
click test package, expand,
double click AA.class
double click BB.class
2, select BugA project, in package explorer, expand,
click src dir,
click test package
double click AA.java
At here,the focus should be EditorSite, and the package explorer selection should be /BugA/src/test/AA.java item.
assertTrue(BugAProject.isExpanded && test.BugAProject.isExpanded)
3.1 type main(Alt+/) complete the method.
do save(Ctrl+S) 
Now, You should see package explorer focus change to 
test.AA.class in test.BugA project and from AA.class to BB.class in turn.
At last stop at test.BB.class in test.BugA project

OK, lets do another option action to show bug case.

At this point, the editor site contains 3 pages, AA.class, BB.class, AA.java

3.2 click Collapse button in project explorer.
click the editor area, select AA.java  page, 
assertTrue(/BugA/src/test/AA.java.isFocused() 
&& packageExplorer.selection==/BugA/src/test/AA.java) 
click the main method, move cursor to main method to add some code.
type sysout(Alt+/), complete the print statement.
do save (Ctrl+s)

OK,
test.BugA project expanded, and focus the BB.class

I hope the steps not too simple to reproduce:)
Of cause, the result differ with the reported behaviours, but I think it do have same source of trouble.
Thanks for the detailed steps. I can reproduce now.
The PackageExplorer changed the selection on partInputChanged without checking that it's the active editor that changed the its input.

Fixed in HEAD.
