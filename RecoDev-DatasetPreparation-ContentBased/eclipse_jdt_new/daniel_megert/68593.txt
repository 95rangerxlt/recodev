Even though "format header comments" is turned off in the general settings
block on the comments tab, Eclipse 3RC3 is formatting the header comments.

This happened with both built-in and all newly generated format templates.

Note: the header comment is only the top-most file comment
right, the top most header is formatted. this happens often if cvs entries are
stored in the header comment :

before format:
/**
  * header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/
header/ header/
  * auto generated header - cvs system
  * $Date: 2004/04/23 15:39:33 $
  * $Author: mspiller $
  * $Revision: 1.1 $
  * $Source: /var/cvs/repos1/header/header/header/header/header/header,v $
  * $State: Exp $ 
  * 
  * Projekt       : header/
  * Teilprojekt   : test
  * Created       : 25.06.2004 mspiller
 */
package de.neusta.test;
public class Test { ...

after format:

/**
 * header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/ header/
 * header/ header/ auto generated header - cvs system $Date: 2004/04/23 15:39:33 $
 * $Author: mspiller $ $Revision: 1.1 $ $Source:
 * /var/cvs/repos1/header/header/header/header/header/header,v $ $State: Exp $
 * Projekt : header/ Teilprojekt : test Created : 25.06.2004 mspiller
 */
package de.neusta.test;

public class Test { ...

It works if your type has Javadoc.
Also note that if your header comment starts with

/*-
 *

it will not get formatted by Eclipse and most likely not by any other tool since
this sort of a Java convention.

I agree that we could improve the heuristic by taking import and package tokens
into account.

Fixed. Will be released once HEAD is open again.

Committed to HEAD
Version: 3.0.1
Build id: 200409161125

Comment gets formatted, despite the option "Format Header Comments" is unset.

The target milestone indicates in which build a fix is. This fix is in 3.1 and
hence you won't see it fixed in older builds like 3.0.1.
