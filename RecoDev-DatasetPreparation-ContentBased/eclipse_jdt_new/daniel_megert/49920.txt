The program "hangs" frequently but shortly when actively working on code in the 
JDT. The system monitor shows a CPU use of 100% for a short time. The hangups 
occur deterministically shorty after openign a source file and reoccur randomly 
during work. Sorry for the unprecise description; its quite hard to track the 
problem down to specific activities.

The settings in "Workbench -> Work in progress -> Machine speed" do not affect 
this behaviour, nor does "Workbench -> Perform build automatically...". Prior 
versions up to 3.0 M5 did not have the problem.

System is Win2000 Service Pack 3 on a 1,8 GHz Athlon, 512MB DDR RAM, no other 
heavy apps running. Eclipse Build id: 200312182000.

Moving to JDT/UI, could be issues related to GC pauses.
Actually moving to JDT UI
Problem still occurs with last integration build I200401130800.

Dani, this looks like the behaviour of the bug that you fixed.

Which perspective are you using? How big are the files?

Java perspective, working on files of org.eclipse.jdt.core project...
As it was said while opening, this problem occured recently. From my experience 
since I installed last integration build I200401130800.
Before I was using M6 and never noticed these hangs...

Sorry, this is a bit confusing. To what do you refer "while opening"? This PR is
reported against 20031218 which is M6.
I refered to PR opening.
I didn't play a lot with M6 as I was in vacations from 17/12/03 to 08/01/04. 
So, trying to find a date since I have noticed the problem, I remembered it 
began since I have installed previous integration build I20040113.
I cannot confirm that this problem also happened for M6 build, but I think, it 
appeared recently as I cannot remember to have been annoyed with this problem 
before leaving in vacations last year... (here's the explanation of "recently").
Hope this is a little bit clearer...

Yes thanks. Maybe you changed some preferences? Do you have the Quick Assist
lightbulbs and the Occurrences Finder (both Work in Progress preference page)
enabled?

I haven't changed any preferences after having installed last I-build.
Both "Quick Assist lightbulbs" and "Occurrences Finder" are NOT checked in my 
workspace.

Can you please switch to I20040121 and provide feedback regarding this PR. Thanks.
With I20040121 I don't see the temporary 'hangups' any longer.
Same for me...
Thanks for the feedback.
David, please reopen if you still see this using I20040121 or newer.

Temporary "hangups" due to 100 % CPU time consumption on fast machine
