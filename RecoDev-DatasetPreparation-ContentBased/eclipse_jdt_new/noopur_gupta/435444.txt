Update JDT T&T document with relevant items from Luna (4.4) N&N documents.
From Luna M1-M7 N&N documents and Java 8 features, here are the relevant items:

- Quick Fixes (now - Quick Assists?) to create 'for' loops:
Probably not necessary in T&T doc, can be added in the list of Available Quick Assists.

- Javaâ„¢ 8 support:

1. Quick Assists and Clean Up:
    * Convert to anonymous class creation
    * Convert to lambda expression

2. Hover to see the functional method:
    * On '->' in lambda expression
    * On '::' in method reference

3. Type Hierarchy shows lambda expressions as implementations of the functional interface.

4. Search: UI for finegrain IJavaSearchConstants#METHOD_REFERENCE_EXPRESSION

Here, 3 and 4 can probably be ignored from being added to T&T doc.

Dani / Markus, please let me know the relevant items from above to be added to the T&T document.

I'd say so too.

Please add the Quick Assists to both. Since they don't appear in Quick Fix hovers, they can be hard to find, so it's good to mention them explicitly in the T&T. Maybe just after "Surround lines"?
Released the changes in JDT Tips & Tricks document and List of Available Quick Assists document with:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=b801c0dc8620c288040293a9ea43197c43307aed
Both the documents have some already existing images that are not being shown on opening the page with internal web browser. Need to check the issue.

For those images, the img src is "PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/...".
They are shown properly when opened via Help > Tips and Tricks..., but not with the imported repo code in the workspace.
Leaving the bug open for any further changes that are required.
Noopur, kindly update the copyright year of the documents. Also verify the same for bug 435639.

I have used "Hover to see the functional method" from the T&T in the final consolidated N&N document.
