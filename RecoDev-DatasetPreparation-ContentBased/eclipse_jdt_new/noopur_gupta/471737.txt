should show the 'D' for default methods.

Is the distinction between the two kinds of override/implement decorations still accurate? If you implement a default method is that 'implement' or 'override'?? (Didn't try).

I'll add that.

Implementing a default method shows the 'override' decoration, which looks correct.

We can update the descriptions of 'implement' and 'override' decorations on the page to just mention "implements method" and "overrides method" resp.

'implement' can be for abstract method from interface or super abstract class. 'override' can be for instance method or default method.
