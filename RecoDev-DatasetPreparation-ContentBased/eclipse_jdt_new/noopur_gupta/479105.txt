Can you adjust your Gerrit build trigger to store more than the last 5 runs? Otherwise it is really hard to analyse build failure of changes, as the build results are removed to quickly.

I think 20, as we use in platform.ui is a good value.

Thanks Lars for the screenshot. Updated max # of builds to keep as 20.
Thanks Noopur for the fast fix.
