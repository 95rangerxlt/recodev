Replace usages of MethodDeclaration#thrownExceptions() in the AST.

For jsr308, MethodDeclaration's thrownExceptions property has been replaced with thrownExceptionTypes. Make a pass over all JDT UI code that uses the old property in any way (direct access or via property descriptor) and update usages.

File separate bugs if things get too complicated somewhere or if you think we should add new features for handling these constructs.

Patch

The attached patch updates the usages of old 'thrownExceptions' property of MethodDeclaration in JDT UI code, except the usage in ExceptionOccurrencesFinder.

Updated Patch

Updated the patch with JUnit fixes for thrownExceptionTypes.
In a few places, you replaced
 ASTNodeFactory.newName(fAST, fImportRewriter.addImport(exceptionType, context))
with
 ASTNodeFactory.newType(fAST, fImportRewriter.addImport(exceptionType, context))

The original code was a kludge from times before ImportRewrite could take an AST. I used the better replacement
 fImportRewriter.addImport(exceptionType, fAST, context)

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=c11b26a1362f47a11287b295af6e00b350648613


http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=4cfd5392c2e3139a9903acc170a1fb06f3bc06c8 doesn't look completely correct. The revert of ChangeMethodSignatureProposal is good, although this could break again when ImportRewrite considers annotations.

JavadocTagsSubProcessor/LocalCorrectionsSubProcessor only worked for un-annotated types. A Javadoc @throws tag cannot contain annotations.
