When code is folded then the bracket hover gets messed up. This is because the code does not use the visual/widget offsets where needed.

Test Case:
1. paste the attached snippet into the 'Package Explorer'
2. fold 'foo'
3. hover over the closing brace of the class
==> hover is wrong and huge

Patch

The patch checks if the widget shell's y co-ordinate is less than the display's y co-ordinate. If so, the widget shell's y co-ordinate is restricted to the display's y co-ordinate and also the height of the widget is adjusted accordingly.

Hence, on hovering a closing brace when code is folded, if the hover popup exceeds the display, the hover popup is restricted to the display above the closing brace and the hover text is displayed from the top.

Dani, please check the behavior and the patch.

This is not good since
- the hover should not leave the window
- the hover is just cut at the end without showing how many lines are skipped

We don't need to cut the hover (widget) itself, but decide to show the cut hover (which shows the number of skipped lines) if the number of lines between the opening and closing bracket are not the same in the visible and the model document.

Here is another test case:

public class C {
	void foo(int a) {
		System.out.println(1);
		class FoldMe {
			
		}
		System.out.println(2);
	}
}

Once the local class is folded, the hover no longer covers exactly the code but starts above the method declarations and is bigger.

Updated the patch. 
Now on hovering a closing brace when the inner code is folded, the cut hover is shown which is the same as show on hovering the closing brace when the code is not folded and not entirely visible.
Dani, please have a look.
