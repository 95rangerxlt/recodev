It's a again a resolving on AST with problems isssue. (I know that the AST is 
not designed for it, but I'm hoping...)

private void foo() {
}
private static void goo() {
  foo();
}
Has the problem that foo() should be static. I have the node of foo: 
Unfortunatly with a null binding.

If the reference is A.foo, the binding is there.

In this case I can retrieve the binding for foo, because the declaring class of
the problem binding is known. So I can try to fix this one. I will run all
jdt/ui tests prior to release.
Fixed and released in 2.1 stream.
