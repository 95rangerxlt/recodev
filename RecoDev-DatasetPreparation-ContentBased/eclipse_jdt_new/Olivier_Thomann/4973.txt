1. Rename org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.wizards.dialogfields to
   org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.wizards.dialogfields1
2. Look at ListDialogField.java
   Half of the imports are corrupted. (i missing)

Created attachment 5
test case
reproduced - it has sth to do with line delimiters.
see the attached file - line delims are unusual.
refactoring forwards the call to IPackageFragment::rename

moving to jcore.
I wonder why this file contains \r\n and \r line delimiters. The problem seems 
to come from the normalizeCRs in the Buffer class. I'll investigate more as 
soon as I can debug again.
Is it normal that a file contains two different line delimiters?
I found the problem. It was located in the normalizeCRs(char[]) in the Buffer 
class. When we got '\r' even if the next character was not '\n', we increment 
the lineStart by two. This is why we missed the 'i' character at the beginning 
of the import statements.
Fixed and released in HEAD. All tests are green.
Files are allowed to have more than one kind of line delimiter. This is 
handeled correctly by the editor. Anyhow,  all our operations try to not 
introduce new line delimiters.


Rename package removes first letter of import statements
