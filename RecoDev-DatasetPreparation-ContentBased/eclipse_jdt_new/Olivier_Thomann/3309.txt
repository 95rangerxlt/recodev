	we've had many, many problems comming from the fact that ICompilationUnit::getType explodes on names with dots in them
	could it maybe throw a JavaModelException in those cases?
	or return a not-existing type?

NOTES:
Is this one ok given the new validation for CU names ?
No. The API should specify that the name has to be a valid compilation unit 
name. If we want to throw a JavaModelException, we should specify it in the API 
as well. This is an API doc change. 
Fixed in head. The javadoc now reflects the right usage of the getType(String ) 
method. This method is not supposed to be used with an illegal compilation unit 
name. A name with a dot is illegal.
