The documentation of this class should clarify that this class is not intended to be subclassed or instantiated.
It is only a bunch of constants. I believe this should have been defined as an interface, but this cannot be changed now.

Proposed fix
Yes, I agree it possibly should have been an interface rather than a class.  Sorry about that.

I am +1 for adding the proposed javadoc.  Olivier, do you want to commit that change, or would you like me to do it?
I can take care of it.
I just wanted you to be aware of it in case I miss something.
Thanks.
Released for 3.4M4.


org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.util.AptPreferenceConstants should clarify its specification
