In this test case, the access$0 method is not reported as being synthetic. It should be the case. It 
seems that the problem comes from the MethodInfo.isSynthetic() method.

seems that the problem comes from the MethodInfo.isSynthetic() method.
The test case is:
public class A010 {
	private int i = 6;
	public int foo() {
		class A 
{
			int get() {
				return i;
			}
		}
		return new A().get();
	}
}
Fix and released in HEAD.
