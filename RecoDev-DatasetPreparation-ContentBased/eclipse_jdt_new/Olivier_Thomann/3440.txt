In order to minimize incremental builder actions, the classfile comparator should be able to ignore the order of members.
Note that this should be optional and not cost on cases where nothing has changed.
The intent is that this mechanism can be turned on/off so as for the builder to experiment.

NOTES:

	The only way to do that is to sort the fields and the members before comparing them. This is commented out in the current source.

Given in general the order is the same, it should perform a strict pass first, 
then sort and recheck.
Done and tests added for 206.
Released in HEAD as soon as 205 is built.
