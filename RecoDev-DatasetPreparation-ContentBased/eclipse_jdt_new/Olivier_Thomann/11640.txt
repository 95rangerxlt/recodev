In build 0314, the following code is not formatted properly.
This is a regression from previous 
build.

[public class FormaterBug {
	public static void main(String[] args) 
{
	}
	public synchronized void method1() {
	}
		public synchronized void method2() 
{
		}
			public synchronized void method3() {
			}
				public synchronized void 
method4() {
				}
					public synchronized void method5() {
					}
						public 
synchronized void method6() {
						}
							public synchronized void method7() 
{
							}
}]

Fixed and released in HEAD. Will be available for the next build (after M4).
Will go into M4
I noticed that my first bug report was fixed in stable build
20020321, but a variation becomes still bad formated 
(as I think):

package de.neze.ide.wsw;
public class FormaterBug {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Object o = null;
		synchronized (o) {
			// DO dsomething
		}
			// Why does the code formater indent that lines?
			o = o;
			o = null;
			o = o;
			o = null;
	}
}

Regression tests added. If you find another problem, please reopen it.
Fixed and released in 
HEAD.
