I would like to enable/disable comment formatting /within/ methods separately 
from outside of methods.  Sometimes we put UseCase comments within a method 
(particularly in tests) and we format them manually.  The manual formatting is 
blown away when the file is formatted because we have enabled comment formatting 
globally (which we still want to have happen).  It might even work just to have 
a "Preserve Line Endings" option in the Comments tab of the Code Formatter 
Editor.  When I enter a new line, I do because I want it there, I don't want the 
comment on the next line to be pushed up to fill the max-characters-per-line 
value.

Ownership changed.
Block/Line/Javadoc comment can be formatted independently from each others in 3.3.
Is this good enough? 
Yes, that works great!
