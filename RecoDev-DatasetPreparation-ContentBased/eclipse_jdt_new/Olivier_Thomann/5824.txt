As we all know this is a religious issue and Eclipse needs
to be able to adapt to peoples bracketing/spacing styles.

Allowing fine control over the code formatting would be very
useful, especially if code formatting profiles could be exported
and loaded (associated with projects?) to support consistent style
through a project.
Perhaps even automatic reformatting on save.

It appears that this could be easily added to Eclipse as the current
formatter strips any spacing out and formats to a consistent style,
so all that should be needed is the configurability and logic to insert
spacing/newlines where required.

IDEA IntelliJ (http://www.intellij.com) is an excellent example of what 
I'm talking about.

After 2.0 is out, we will likely consider reworking considerably the code formatter. Deferring it until then.
Resurrecting formatter issues in 2.1 stream.
Clearing resolution
We need to clear 2.1 bug reports that won't be addressed before 2.1. The new 
implementation is still in the works. Therefore we cannot include it for 2.1. 
Not enough testing and we need to polish the preferences. This will be address 
for 2.2 as stated in the JDT/Core plan.
Resurrecting for 3.0
Reopen for 3.0 consideration.
The new formatter has more than an hundred different options. You can customize
a lot. When the preference page will be available (between M4 and M5), let me
know if you want more customization.
Fixed and released in HEAD.


Code Formatter needs to be more customizable to be useful
