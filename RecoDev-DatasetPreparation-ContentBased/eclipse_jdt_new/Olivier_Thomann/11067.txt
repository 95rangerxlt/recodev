For debugging purpose, it is useful to have a toString() method.
What would you like to see 
inside this toString() method?

Something very verbose? Simply the class name + 
getStartPosition() and getLength()?

Don't hesitate to provide examples of what you 
expect.

i would something close to what a pretty printer output would be 
(without all the super-smart formating, of course)
so, for an InfixExpression 3 + 3 it'd be: 3 + 3
positions are less interesting - i can look them up in the nodes.

btw, the internal ast nodes have useful info in toString - something like that 
would do
Dumping the entire tree in a node seems excessive. On some nodes, these strings
will be many KB long. I have a hard time believing that that would be useful
for users debugging AST programs. (It is also likely to be mistaken for and
used as a means for serializing AST.)

For debug purposes, something that fits on a reasonable length line (<150 
chars) is more appropriate.
I agree that pretty printing is not the right thing to do. I propose something 
like this:

- expression: pretty print
- statement: pretty print
- blocks
  [0] statement type (for example VariableDeclarationStatement)
  [1] statment type (for example Expression)
  ...
- method declaration: the signature
- type declaration: the signature
...



Is this ok for everybody? If yes, I start to implement the Dirk's suggestion.
methods are typically both not-all-too-long and interesting
same for blocks

so, my suggestion is:
- expression: pretty print
- statement: pretty print
- blocks: pretty print
- method declaration: pretty print

- type declaration: signature + list of method signatures
- compilation unit: signature + list of types
...

Jim made some changes in this area. Don't hesitate to suggest improvements.
Fixed and released 
in HEAD.
