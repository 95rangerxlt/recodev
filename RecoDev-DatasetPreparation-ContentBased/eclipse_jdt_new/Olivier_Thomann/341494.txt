Using latest, this doesn't return a string representation for string constants. There is no double quotes at the beginning and the end of the return value which doesn't make it a string representation of the string constant.

Proposed fix + regression tests
+1; this looks like a correct patch for 3.7.

It is surprising that no one has run into this yet.  Hopefully fixing this bug will not break existing processors written to the incorrect behavior!  I think fixing it is the right thing to do, though.

Too bad if existing processors rely on a bug. javac doesn't have the bug so users that would try their processors on javac as well should see the problem.
I released the change and I tagged the map file.
Thanks for validating the patch, Walter.
