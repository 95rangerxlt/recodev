NOTE: All of my plugins were binary.
I can only reproduce this with a binary project.
highlighter == outliner?
yup, step #5 should be:

5. In the outliner, select the static method setExceptionHandler
(IExceptionHandler)


Since the selection is working for the other methods in this type I suspect 
that the source range is not correct. Moving to JDT Core for investigation.
*** Bug 15042 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Problem in SourceMapper#getUnqualifiedMethodHandle() when a method's parameter 
type is an inner type.

Fixed.


Outliner doesn't highlight method
