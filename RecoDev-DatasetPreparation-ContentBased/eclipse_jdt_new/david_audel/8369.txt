Here's a test case:

1. JUnit setup
2. Open TestCase
3. Goto the declaration of fName
4. Below enter the following code (anonymous class Test):
	private Test x= new Test() {
		/*
		 * @see Test#countTestCases()
		 */
		public int countTestCases() {
			return 0;
		}

		/*
		 * @see Test#run(TestResult)
		 */
		public void run(TestResult result) {
		}

	};
5. At this point you can save - but this does not change the result
6. Now try to add a second anonymous class:
	private Test y= new T<CODE ASSIST HERE>
==> code assist does not give hints (except templates)

I used code assist to enter the first peaces of above code.

moving to JDT core for investigation
inMethodStack and inFieldInitializationStack are not initialized properly after 
recovery

Fixed.


Code assist stops to work after anonymous class
