BUILD: 05022002

While working on some code completion enhancements (bug 9100), I noticed that 
the completion engine does not report packages for local variables.  

Although I don't know for sure, I think this was put in to prevent NPE when the 
local var type has not been resolved (qualified name, no import).  Is there 
something more to this, or is the code below OK?  I have been running with 
the "fix" for a couple days now, and no ill effects so far :)

I added the following line: 

local.type == null ? NoChar : local.type.qualifiedPackageName(),

near line 2348 (I can't be sure I didn't change the line number, but just look 
for "requestor.acceptLocal"

Your fix is good for me.

Fixed.
