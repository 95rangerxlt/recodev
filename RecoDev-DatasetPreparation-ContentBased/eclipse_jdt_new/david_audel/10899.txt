ResourceDeletedVisitor is a member type of DebugUIPlugin
moving to Java Core for investigation.
In classfile, declaring type of a member type is the first paramater of the 
member type constructors. This parameter miss in binary method selection.

Fixed.


Can't open on selection for member type in binary class
