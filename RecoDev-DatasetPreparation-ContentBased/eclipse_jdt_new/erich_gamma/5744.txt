The first time I used the apply patch dialog (context menu -> Compare With -> 
Patch...) I did not realize I had to select the correct project first. I 
thought it was more like Import, which lets you select the project once you are 
in the wizard. It would be nice if the dialog displayed the project (or folder 
or package) that it thought you were applying the patches to.

This is already implemented in our latest.



Apply Patch dialog needs to indicate project
