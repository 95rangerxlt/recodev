Dirk fixed bug 39038 which later caused a compile error in JDT JUnit in
N20030802 because it depends on internal JDT UI code:
http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/N-N20030802-200308020010/compilelogs/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.junit_3.0.0/junitsupport.jar.bin.log

I adapted the offending code however, to avoid such problem JDT JUnit should not
depend on SWTUtil.

Another solution would be to ask that bug 30071 gets higher priority.

jdt.junit belongs to the jdt.ui component and there is no need to duplicate
SWTUtil. Removing the duplication.
