Build 20020514

In the java content outline, if I select:

show fields -> False
show static members -> True

It shows me all static fields.  This is wrong because I said "don't show 
fields".  The filters should combine, not cancel each other out.

changed the semantics of the filters closer to what they were before
Verified.


content outline shows static fields when it shouldn't
