In some cases, there are no reference I care about outside the compilation unit, and under
those circumstances it is irrelevant to spend seconds to search for references to the renamed
element. I would like a checkbox in the rename wizard which allows me to bypass the reference
fix up overhead.

I am wondering if the reference fixup should not only happen if I choose to go 'next' in the
refactoring wizard. If I simply hit finish, then I get nothing for free.
