Customer request:

Assume you have a simple compilation unit

public class X {
	public int x;
	public float y;
	public String z;
}

If you have the first two public lines selected (fields x, y) and bring up the 
find dialog, the scope should default to selected lines.

(The customer's "guess" of an interesting selection is more than one word; an 
alternate definition is more than one line.  The later may be what you want 
since you already truncate the search string in this case)

Since the scope can be lines only we should switch to the line scope when the 
selection is >= 1 line.

Claude has already fixed it - it will be in M5
