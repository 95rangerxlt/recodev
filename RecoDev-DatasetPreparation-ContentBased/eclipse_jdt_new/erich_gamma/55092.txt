During the icon pass Dirk has discovered that we still have the new Snippet 
Wizard in our code. Given that jdt.debug.ui implements snippets, this code 
should also be owned by jdt.debug.

The code is:
NewSnippetFileCreationWizard.java
NewSnippetFileWizardPage.java

I suggest that you adopt them and the extension point contribution and we will 
delete them once you have them moved.

I also believe we should move the OpenSnippetWizardAction.
I have created the OpenSnippetWizardAction, NewSnippetFileCreationWizard, and 
NewSnippetFileWizardPage in our code base.

I created a new wizard sub category Java Run/Debug under the Java category for 
New Wizards.
The OpenSnippetWizardAction is part of the Java Debug element creation action 
set. The action is added to the toolbar path of the Java element creation 
action set.

So the changes I see required in JDT UI:
Delete the 3 classes
Delete the icons
Remove the definition of the wizard in the plugin.xml
Remove the definition of the open action in the plugin.xml
Remove the help context ids from IJavaHelpContextIds
Remove the context definitions in the contexts_JDT.xml file.
As well there are numerous "old" snippet editor image descriptions defined in 
the JavaPluginImages.
Moving to JDT UI to delete the "old" state.
Erich, can you please delete the code. I already commented out the icons.
done - thanks for the check list!
