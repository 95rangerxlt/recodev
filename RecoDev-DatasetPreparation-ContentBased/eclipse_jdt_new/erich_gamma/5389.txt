The common scenario (at least in coreland) is to have only on type in a 
compilation unit. I usually find myself trying to use F4 to open the hierarchy 
view on a java file I have just opened. OK, basically I have two feature 
requests in one PR.

1) Ideally, I would like to have the hierarchy view automatically open types 
when my editor has the focus on them.

2) If (1) is not possible, I would like to be able to use F4 from anywhere in 
a compilation unit and, if this unit has only one type, it could be open it in 
the hierarchy view. If it has two or more, a dialog could come up and ask 
which type you want to be open.

Creating a type hierarchy is expensive, it can take minutes for 
java.lang.Object. So 1) would give us more problems than benefit. Also remark 
that it would become harder to work on a hierarchy without a stable view of it; 
the view would switch all the time.
2) is already implemented. Press F4 on a empty editor selection. F4 should work 
in all (Java) views. If not, please file a PR.


F4 should work from anywhere in a compilation unit if the unit has only one type
