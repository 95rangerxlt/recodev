- Check "Keep JUnit running after a test run when debugging" in a JUnit Plug-in
Test LaunchConfiguration
- Debug the JUnit Plug-in Test
-> Observe: The workbench is not closed after the tests have finished, which is
cool and saves much time when rerunning a single test.

- Click "Rerun last Test"
-> Doesn't work, because the workspace is still in use. Manually clicking on
"Stop JUnit Test Run" before re-starting is a workaround, but I think that this
should be done automatically.

A dialog box allowing to cancel the existing VM would be an option.
