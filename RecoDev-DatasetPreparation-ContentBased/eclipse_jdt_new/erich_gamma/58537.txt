New source lookup facilities have been added to the debug platform. The Java 
debugger provides a corresponding new implementation for source lookup. The 
following patch will migrate the JUnit launch config to use the new source 
lookup support. The changes are:

* specify the platform source lookup tab in the tab group
* no longer initialize the source locator attribute in launch shortcuts
* specify the source locator and source path computer for the JUnit launch 
config type in plug-in XML
