I just spent about 5 minutes looking for the tool in the 1204 drop (was too 
stupid to right click on a package). It may be useful to include the tool as 
part of the Java refactoring menu, because NL separation is a form of 
refactoring ... and the menu is the first place where I looked.

In fact the string externalization is implemented with the refactoring 
infrastructure. 

However, the problem your pointing out is more general in that actions that are 
only available in the context menu for a particular object selection are 
difficult to discover by the user. There are other actions in this category.

We have a menu reorg on the plan and will address this as part of this effort. 
The idea is to introduce a "Code" menu where coding support actions go (e.g. 
generate getter/setter)
string externalization is now in the Source menu.
