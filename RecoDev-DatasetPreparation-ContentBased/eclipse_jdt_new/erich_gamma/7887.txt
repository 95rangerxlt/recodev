Hi, Eclipse provides the "format" function like in Visual Age with more 
options. But the shortkey <ctrl> + W (as it is in VAJ) doesn't work. I would 
really like (as user) if that was included into Eclipse.

Thanks, Thierry.

As well, it would be very great if there was a shortkey editor.

Moving to JDT for consideration
in eclipse it's always been ctrl+o
ctrl+w is taken by 'manage markers' menu

ok to close the report?

there is now short cut ctrl-o
closing


shortkey for code formater
