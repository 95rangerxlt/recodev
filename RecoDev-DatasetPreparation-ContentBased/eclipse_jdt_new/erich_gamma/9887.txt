when structural compare first shows up 
(on releasing a cu, for example)
only the first node is fully expanded

the problem is that the first node is, in like 90% of cases, the import 
container. 
suffice it to say that changes in imprort container are less interesting to 
most people that changes in classes.

maybe, some smartness could detect if there are any class/interface nodes and 
expand the first one.

fixed in the 20020226 build


not useful initial expansion in structural compare
