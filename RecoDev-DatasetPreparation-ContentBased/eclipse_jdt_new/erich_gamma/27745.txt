Build 20021204 + org.eclipse.pde.junit_2.0.1 (2002/12/11)

I just took the latest org.eclipse.pde.junit. I checked 'Clear workspace data 
before launching' but this has no effect. The workspace created by the previous 
run is not cleared, and my tests are failing.

The org.eclipse.pde.junit_2.0.1 (2002/10/14) version didn't not have this 
problem (you could not specify the workspace location and it was cleared 
automaticaly)

this is a dup i think
This is also an issue when running the runtime workbench - I don't think it is 
specifically a JUnit issue.
Could be related to Bug 27771
