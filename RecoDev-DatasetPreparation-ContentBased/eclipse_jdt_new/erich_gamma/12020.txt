It seems to be impossible to get some of the context menu options from the JB 
perspective.  Major example: override methods/add constructors.  I am forced to 
add the hierarchy view to the perspective, F4 the type, and do it from there.  
I should be able to get to the same context menu's when right-clicking on the 
type in the Types view as I do in the packages view.  In summary:  The context 
in the Types view should be the same as the context right clikcing on the Type 
in the packages view when "Show members in packaged view" is enabled.

Also... typing "F4" with the type highlighted should open the type in the 
hierarchy view, which is the behavior from packages view.
