this bug is blocking us from adding short cuts for cut/copy/paste in the 
outliner.

I noticed that the JavaOutlinePage has some special init code and it could 
cause this problem. 

Randy, does this work for other Outline pages?
JavaOutlinePage.createControl calls getSite so this must be working.
First the page is constructed, then init is called, then createControl is 
called. So perhaps you are calling getSite too early.

I noticed in checking our code that the last paragraph of the JavaDoc for 
IContentOutlinePage was wrong and have released a fix.



Page::init(IPageSite pageSite) never called on JavaOutlinePage
