When running org.eclipse.pde.junit_20020508 I get

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/core/launcher/UIMain
Exception in thread "main" 

Which seems to be logical as UIMain apparently is no more part of startup.jar

Am I missing something ?

this is fixed in 20020510 
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-
home/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.junit/org.eclipse.pde.junit_20020510.zip
broken link ;-(
and another attempt...

i'm afraid that the latest eclipse update change have broken it again, so just 
reopen it <g>
