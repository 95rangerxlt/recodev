Using I20021213 I can't run nor create PDE JUnit launch configurations.

I tried with versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.0, and they produce the same error.

I will attach stack traces for running and add PDE JUnit launch configurations.

Created attachment 2789
stack trace generated when creating new launch configuration

On the Run launch configuration page, when pressing "New" having JUnit Plugin
Test selected, nothing happens, and this stack trace is generated in the log.
Created attachment 2790
stack trace generated when running an existent configuration

This stack trace is generated when running an existing configuration. A error
dialog appears: "Exception occurred during launch", reason: "Error within Debug
UI".
I'm getting this as well.  This is preventing me from running the test suites.

Are you running the nightly build?

PDE junit has to use internal API - will have to adapt to new one.



See the compile errors when building against 1213.

pde.junit has to use internal PDE API. I will adapt and do another effort to 
get some minimal API from PDE so that the code doesn't have to be duplicated.
fixed pde.junit 2.1.2 is available from 
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-
