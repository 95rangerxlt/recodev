If you run a junit test with all junittests, everything is ok.
Then if you want to rerun a single test which is not in the first tested class
the test is started with the correct method name but with the first tested class
in the displayed tree not with the class whose method was selected for rerun.

Sometime the first junit-class in the project does not have a method with same
name, then the error shows up.

Occured in 3.0M9

To repeat :

have more than one junit-Testcase subclasses in your project
run all tests in the run configurations view
if all tests are ok, go to the second class in the hierarchy tab of the junit
view, then select a method name for rerun  ( Right mouse -> Run ) 

Teh run will fail if the method name is not visible in the first class of the
project. Even doubleclicking the method name will show error that the method is
not available in the first class of the project ( not in the class tested )

*** Bug 64841 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
A major issue the launch config is reusing the type name from the previous 
lunch. Fix is trivial and should be included in RC2

Doesn't work for me on 200406110010. I do:

Test-Project with package p and the following classes:

public class T1 extends TestCase {

	public void testOne() {
		// Assert.fail("T1 failed");
	}
}

public class T3 extends TestCase {
	public void testThree() {
		
	}
}

- run all test in test project
- select testThree in hierarchy view. 
- select Run from context menu.

junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Method "testThree" not found
