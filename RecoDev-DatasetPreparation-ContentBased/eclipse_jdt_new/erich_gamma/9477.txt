Build: 20020205-I
This is a brand-new download of 20020205-I, and a brand new workspace.
Nothing is old except for the jre... (IBM).
Here are the steps I followed. I will attach the .log (it is large).
1) Download 20020205-I plus examples to a new directory, make a new workspace 
directory, launch eclipse with -data pointing to the new workspace directory.
2) In repositories view, connect to dev.eclipse.org AND to cvslnx.
3) Turn off autobuild.
4) Select all org.eclipse.swt.* projects from HEAD in dev.eclipse.org and Add 
to Workspace.
5) Select 4 projects from cvslnx HEAD and Add to Workspace.
6) Go to Navigator view (still only have Resource perspective open at this 
point) and Copy the file .classpath_win32 in org.eclipse.swt
7) Then Rename "Copy of .classpath_win32" to ".classpath" <grumble> 2-step 
operation </grumble>
8) Then I tried to open a Java Perspective (note that I still haven't built 
anything - I planned to go to the Java Perspective and then say Build All, but 
I never got that far...)
9) Walkback. Log file attached.

Created attachment 350
.log file showing multiple walkbacks while trying to open Java perspective
Created attachment 351
Still can't open Java perspective - still getting walkbacks - here is dialog
We have changed the ImageRegistry to be lazy this avoids the display access in 
this particular case. The fix went into the 20020214 stable build. We could 
never. However, we could never reproduce the problem and therefore verify it.
Pls let us know whether you still have this problem.
