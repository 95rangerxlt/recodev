	The F5 assigned to various actions:
		- debug -> step into (menu ation)
		- refresh in package viewer

	This results in an a conflict while debugging and using the package view.

MA (13.08.2001 12:28:22)
	To assign the almost all F-keys to debug actions seems to be not a good idea. The actions are available globally, what does
	not make sense

NOTES:
EG (8/31/2001 11:05:30 AM)
	There is a problem with the viewpart short cuts that are implemented as keylisteners.
	when the packages view has focus then refresh will win. The problem shows up
	when the packages view has focus and the debugger is active.
	Not crtical for 1.0

Martin, can you please add a comment. I really don't know what the PR is for
F5 is used in two places: For 'refresh' in the packages view and
for 'step in' in the Debug menu (debug perspective)

I would remove the refresh from the packages view.
fixed as part of the menu reorg


F5 key used at several places (1GIE779)
