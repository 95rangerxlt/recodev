The "Show in Packages View" shows up an items selected in the Packages View.
I.e. the menu appears in the context menu of the Packages View but shouldn't. 
Is there a way to exclude an object contribution from a particular view? 
Because this is what is wanted: appear everywhere except in Packages View.
There is currently no way of excluding object contributions on a per-view basis.
Nick, what do you recommend should we accept this limitation for now given that 
action contribution improvements are on the plan or should we fallback to 
contributing this action from code.

As currently designed, the action contribution mechanism is really intended 
only for extending parts written by others, not for being the central mechanism 
for populating view menus.
I have doubts about how far we can generalize this given the constraints on 
eager plugin loading.
For this specific case, though, I could imagine being able to test the id of 
the part in the XML.

If you want to push in this direction to find the weak points, it would help as 
input for improvements.

As an alternative approach I tried to do this in the ShowInPackagesVewAction:

/*
 * @see IObjectActionDelegate#setActivePart(IAction, IWorkbenchPart)
 */
public void setActivePart(IAction action, IWorkbenchPart targetPart) {
  setEnabled(!JavaUI.ID_PACKAGES.equals(targetPart.getSite().getId()));
  ..	
}

hoping that disabled actions are not added to the context menu.
doesn't work yet, I think the call to setActivePart comes when the action has 
already been added to the menu.
setActivePart is called after adding the action to the JFace IMenuManager, but 
before it is asked to fill itself in the SWT Menu.  Even if it was done after, 
it should update the corresponding MenuItem immediately.
fixed in 0411
