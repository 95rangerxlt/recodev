I have the following code, when I right click and do 'organise imports' it adds
import sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.e;
---
		addMouseListener(new MouseListener()
		{
			public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)
			{
				MMediator oMed = MMediator.getInstance();

				oMed.setCurrentAttInCurrentDisplay((JComponent) 
e.getSource());
				oMed.changePropertyView((MPropertyDisplayI) 
_startForm);
			}
			public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e)
			{}
			public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e)
			{}
			public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e)
			{}
			public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e)
			{}
		});
	}

I am using stable build 20020321, with JDK1.4

It works fine with JDK1.3

If you want to get rid of the class name with a single lowercase letter, please check the option in 
Workbench>Preferences>`Java>Organize Imports>Do not create imports for types starting with 
a lowercase letter.
This will solve your problem for now.
Organize import implementation belongs to JDT/UI and is being questionned.
this is fixed with the new organize imports implemenatation: If you have an 
import for MouseEvent, 'e' will be recogniced as field access.
