if i'm in a method and choose to run as junit plugin test then
often the name of the method is appended to the class name in the 
launch config dropdown

this would suggest that only 1 test method is run
but it's not the case - all test methods are run

it's quite confusing

btw. even if there was a way to run just 1 test it'd still be questionable on 
editor selection - i never think which method i'm in when i choose run as...
so a resticting this function to a method selected in a view or in some other 
way giving me a choice of what i really want to launch would be preferreed here
removed the editor selection behaviour.


strange  label shown in launch config [JUnit]
