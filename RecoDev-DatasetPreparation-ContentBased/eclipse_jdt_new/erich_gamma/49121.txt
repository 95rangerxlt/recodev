which is IMO correct. Link with Editor does back linking (e.g reveal the 
editor in the packages explorer) not forwarding linking.
To clarify, I was talking about a limitation in back linking.
The expectation is that when you toggle linking on, the file for the current 
editor is selected and shown in the Package Explorer, even if it is already the 
current selection but hidden.

Compare with the Navigator.
