The types view has no 'externalize strings' action.
no improved planned - NLSing is enabled on .java file only
we should investigate in making actions that are available on CUs to be also 
available on top-level types. We want to do the same with team actions.
should be fixed with the menu reorg
This is a general problem and not a externalize String action problem and not a 
menu reorg problem. As other actions the externalize string action doesn't work 
on types. What users want is that some actions take the CU as an input element 
even if the top level type of that CU is selected. There are several solutions 
to achieve this:

- we hack every action.
- we implement a special seleciton provider and a special action that converts
  top level types in CUs for those actions.
- we use IAdaptable in those actions.

A special case is he team menu because those actions are contributed via XML. A 
solution has to ensure that those actions don't appear twice in the menu.

I opt to open a more general PR and not fixing any special case separately.

Moving back to MA for commenting
I would say every action has to be changed.
The other two solutions are quite a hack.

Moving to Adam, to enable the action on a type
needs  discussion - i disagree with the suggested solution.
it would mean that we have to change all our actions - otherwise it'd be 
inconsistent.
the only exception is currently made for copying types (which copies enclosing 
files)
back to inbox
after the discussion: we'll try doing that for all actions.
fixed this one - enabled on types
