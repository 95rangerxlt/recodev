Build 205
1. Create new java project
2. Open build path properties
3. Check JRE_LIB so it is exported
4. Press OK
5. Open build path properties again
Observe: JRE_LIB is not exported (but it is according to the .classpath)
If you press OK without paying attention, you will loose the fact that JRE_LIB 
was exported.
