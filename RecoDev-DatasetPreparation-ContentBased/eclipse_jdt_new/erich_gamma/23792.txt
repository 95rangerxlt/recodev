I had the same problem in version 2.0 when starting eclipse with command line
argument "-dev". Without that test execution works.
not clear whether both problems are caused by an incorrect use of -dev. 

However, since others got trapped by -dev I've changed the code so that 
independent of -dev both the output folder and the JAR are on the build class 
path.
