For a better integration of JUnit into the IDE I would suggest the following points:

- Separate directory for test sources (optional from within the project
properties). This directory is the default directory for newly created tests
(New > Java > JUnit > Test Case / Test Suite).

- The automatically generated sources should be configurable on the preferences
pages (Prefs > Java > Code Generation > Code and Comments). That is, for the
test case comments and test methods.

- Selecting a set of classes and selecting "Create Tests" should create test
case stubs into the test directory.

- Selecting a class / package should provide the action "Run JUnit Test for
Class" / "Run JUnit Test for Package". The current implementation of "Run As >
JUnit Test", does not really work, if there are single tests and suites.

Erich, can you please comment.
(please don't submit combo bug reports they are difficult to track, file a bug 
report for each enhancment request)

>- Separate directory for test sources 
adding support for a "test" source folder is a reasonable enhancement 
request.  

>- The automatically generated sources should be configurable 
yes, it should be possible to configure the generated body of a test method.  

>- Selecting a set of classes and selecting "Create Tests" should 
>create test case stubs into the test directory.
there are extensions that support this, we will not provide this support in 
JDT.

I don't understand this request.
Sorry, I will file separate enhancement requests.

>>Test for Class" / "Run JUnit Test for Package". The current

If I just want to test a single unit of the application, I do not want to look
for the corresponding test case. I thought that selecting the class in the
package explorer should bring up the option "Run JUnit Test for Class". The
corresponding test is then looked up and run automatically.

The same could be implemented for a set of classes and packages.

I filed a bug report for each enhancement request:

  bug 49611
  bug 49612
  bug 49613

Consequently set this bug to resolved. Sorry for the inconvenience.


Better integration of JUnit (e.g. dir for test sources, code generation ...) [JUnit]
