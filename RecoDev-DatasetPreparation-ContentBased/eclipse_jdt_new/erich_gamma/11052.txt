In the Hierarchy view, public classes and 'package access', or 'default' 
classes have different icons.  (Package classes have a small blue triangle 
superimposed on the icon.)

However there do not appear to be corresponding icons for private or protected 
classes.  (These classes must be inner classes).

The icon is very useful, as it helps me visually filter classes which are not 
part of the public interface.  But in this case private inner classes 
incorrectly appear to be more visible than package access classes, since they 
get the same icon as public classes.
