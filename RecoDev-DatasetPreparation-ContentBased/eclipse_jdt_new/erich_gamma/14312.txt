When I click on a method element in the packages view, I get things like "Build 
Project" and "Open Type hierarchy" which do not apply to the method I've 
selected.  It seems to me that removing these Actions from the context menu 
would allow space for things like "Format" or "Comment Out".

'open type hierarchy' is a valid entry for methods - it should open the 
hierarchy in the lock mode, though (entered a bug 14338)
Build project is only contributed when auto build is turned-off. Rebuild is 
always available and context sensitive and should be provided in the context 
menu.

The are reworking the context menu structure and the menu will get slimmer.
