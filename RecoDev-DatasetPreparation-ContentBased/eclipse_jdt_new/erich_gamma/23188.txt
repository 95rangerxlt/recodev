I cannot ask the Open Type dialog for types ending in "X" with the RE "*X". I 
get lower case "x"s AND types that do not end in "X" or "x". Very annoying to 
have to sift through hundreds of classes to find the one I want when I do not 
want to type the whole thing or I am not sure which one I really want until I 
see a short list. 

How do you ask for classes that end in a given string anyhow? Can it be done?

Thank you,
Gary
