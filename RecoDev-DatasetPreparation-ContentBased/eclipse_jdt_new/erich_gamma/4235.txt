If we start doing this we should be consistent and do it for every action.

Erich, what is your opinion.
Supporting to version top-level types and showing version info is on our plan.

Show version info is now a global Decorator setting. We will add Decorator 
support to all JDT views. However, we are now using the standard VCM decorator 
and it currently doesn't allow us to hook it in for rendering the type.

I agree that we should do "it" for all actions, but this requires additional 
support from some contributed actions in particular the team actions.
