buttons that are used to choose a color for something 
(like console output colors, editor background color etc.) 
come in 2 different sizes - debug has one and everybody else uses another one.

i don't know what the correct size is - but it should be used consistently 
in the IDE

The console page is using the default ColorFieldEditor...which I believe is 
correctly setting the button dimension hints.  

Propose that jdt ui set the button dimension hints on the "browse color" 
buttons to be consistent.
editor preference pages will be reworked and we will likely not use color 
buttons at all.
