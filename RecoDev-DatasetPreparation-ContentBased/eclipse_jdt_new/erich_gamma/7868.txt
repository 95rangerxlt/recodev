Somewhere there is some conflicting interaction between JDT's decorator (in the 
packages view) and the CVS decorator. If you flip on the CVS decorator when the 
workspace has been started, everything paints correctly. If, however, you exit 
the workbench with the decorator on and restart, weird behaviour happens:

-Some nodes appear to be decorated by JDT and then passed to CVS: we decorate 
these fine and both JDT and CVS decorations are visible.

-Some nodes are not decorated by CVS; actually I suspect they are decorated by 
CVS and THEN decorated by JDT, which somehow un-does the CVS decorations.

The general problem is ordering - it looks like in some circumstances JDT 
either decorates too late, or perhaps decorates twice.

This may be as a result of PR 7861. Please reload org.eclipse.ui to be sure.
I think this can probably be closed; decorating in the packages view seems to
work great now.
