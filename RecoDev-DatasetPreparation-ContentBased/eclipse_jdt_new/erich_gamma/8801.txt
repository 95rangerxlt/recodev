Eclipse will only support full icons and we should remove the basic ones.

Dani can you pls take care of this (not critical)

Is this also valid for *all* our plug-ins, including C Tooling?

This is a 2.0 decision so I wouldn't bother about the C tooling which is 1.0 
only.
I have removed the "basic" directory and adapted the code.
I did not move the icons from "icons/full" to "icons" to be able to compare with
previous versions. Is that OK?

I did it for:
  org.eclipse.compare
  org.eclipse.search
  org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui
  org.eclipse.jdt.ui
  org.eclipse.jdt.ui.browsers

I checked (no basic icons):
  org.eclipse.jdt.ui.vcm
  org.eclipse.junit

I did not check/change:
  org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor
  org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.projects
  org.eclipse.compare.examples
  org.eclipse.ui
	Text Editor
	JFace Text
I left the PR open - maybe you want to assign it to someone else

removed the icons from the example project.
