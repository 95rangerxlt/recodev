I find the pink highlighting of brackets very visually distracting. Please let 
me select another color.

Also, PLEASE PLEASE allow me to TURN OFF the bracket highlighting feature. I 
find it distracting in general, and not everyone wants it.

Also, if the cursor is on top of the highlighted box, the cursor itself flashes 
in a bright green, which is also quite weird.
User can trun off bracket matching. Additionally the color is customizable


I don't like pink
