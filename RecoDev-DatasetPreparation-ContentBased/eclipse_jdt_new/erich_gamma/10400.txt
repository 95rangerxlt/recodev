The source archive in the JUnit plugin is called: "src.jar"
whereas the pattern used by most (all?) other plugins would
suggest it should be: "junitsrc.zip".

This seems to cause problems for the PDE plugin import utility
as it refuses to import the source code as it does for other
plugins.

Debug does not own the junit plug-in. Moving to JUI.
rename src.jar to junitsrc.zip to be consistent with the other plugins
