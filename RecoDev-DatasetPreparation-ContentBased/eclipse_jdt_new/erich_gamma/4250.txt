- create a workspace with a package that contains a CU
	- select the CU and start DND.
	- hover over the container package

	Note: this was possible with old reorg support.

NOTES:
EG (9/24/2001 8:06:16 AM)
	we don't support copy when the file already exists.
	this is the first complaint that we no longer allow it.
	How about creating the duplicate elements as
	"CopyOfOriginalElement.java".

AK (9/25/2001 9:43:00 AM)
	is the following semantic acceptable? (it'll be consistent with the navigator) 
	_copy only_ 

	# if the file (let's asume it has nama A.ext) already exists, then create a file named CopyOfA.ext 
	note this can create names	 like CopyOf(CopyOf)*A.ext
	but i don't think it's a problem, really
	# for files, packages, folders - it's all the same semantics
	
	# for java files nothing else than creating a new one with the new name is done 
	(no declaration, reference etc. update)
	# for packages - only the package declaration in files is updated i.e. changed to CopyOfold.package.name
	# for other entities - only the straightforward 'copy with rename' operation
	# no interaction with user - just creates the entities

	What exactly does "for other entities - only the straightforward 'copy with rename' operation" mean ? Does the copy
	action prompt me for a new name when coping other element (e.g. image.gif) and only for CU we use the CopyOf semantic?

	I know the the Window Explorer is using the CopyOf approach but I must say that I really prefer the Copy-Rename appraoch.

	I can live with both approaches as long as the UI is consistent.

	it'd be CopyOf... everywhere
