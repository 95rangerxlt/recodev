ILaunchConfiguration#launch(String, IProgressMonitor) never performs a build
prior to the launch. DebugUITools#launch(ILaunchConfiguratio, String) saves and
builds the workspace according to the current preference settings.
We should change this for 3.0 to be consistent.
the code was already calling DebugUITools.saveAndBuildBeforeLaunch(), but 
calling DebugUITools.launch() is both simpler and better.
change released
