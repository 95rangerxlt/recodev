Build 20021113

1. Add a new test case called "MyTestCase" for class A
2. Add a new test case, select class B to be tested
3. Enter "MyTestCase" as name
==> error message says:
Test case already exists

This can be misleading since there is no test case for class B. It should read:
Test case named "MyTestCase" already exists
or:
There is already a test case named "MyTestCase"
