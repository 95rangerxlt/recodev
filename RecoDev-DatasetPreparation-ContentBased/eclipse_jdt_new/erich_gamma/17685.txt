Adam, can you please be a little bit more concrete regarding what causes the 
leak. RefactorActionbGroup doesn't keep a reference to an IAcitonBars directly. 
It keeps a references to an IWorkbenchSite which keeps a reference to an 
IActionBars. If this causes a memeory leak then our whole action group context 
is questionable.

Here is how I understand the architecture:

- we create action groups per view part, page or editor part
- those parts manage a site which manages an action bar
- our groups keep a reference to the the site.

If a view part dies, it site dies and therefore the action group and the aciton 
bar can be garbage collected.

sorry, you're correct about RefactorActionGroup

here's the list of action groups that do store action bars:

DeclarationsSearchGroup
ImplementorsSearchGroup
ReadReferencesSearchGroup
ReferencesSearchGroup
WriteReferencesSearchGroup
Moving to Daniel Megert. I assume that the way how the search Result view deals 
with action groups might cause this. They are managed per search operation not 
per view part.
The reference itself is not a problem.
I fixed one bug in that area: dispose was not called on fActionGroup in the
SearchResultViewer.

The references should now be gone.

Adam, please verify
pls verify

we should verify this one when we make the next leak pass.


actionGroups should not store action bars
