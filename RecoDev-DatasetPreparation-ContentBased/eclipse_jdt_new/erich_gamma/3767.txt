	Smoke 118

	1) edit a *.java file (editor is dirty)
	2) delete it in the packages view.
	3) give the focus to the editor
	4) you get a dialog saying that the file has been deleted. (nice)
	5) say you want to save the file
	6) a dialog comes up with no initial selection for neither the location nor the file name

	I would expect the dialog to come up with the file's old location and file name, so that
	if the file was deleted accidentally, I can just hit return.
