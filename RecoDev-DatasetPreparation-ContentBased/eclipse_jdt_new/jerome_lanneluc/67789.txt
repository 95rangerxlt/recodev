RC2

1. Follow the 'getting started' example 'Overlapping products in a common source
tree': Project has external folder as source folder that contains
com
  xyz
    product1
    product2
where com/xyz/product2/ is excluded.
-> The package explorer renders a package 'com.xyz' and a package
'com.xyz.product1' ( as seen in the documents screenshot)

2. In the Windows explorer first move the whole 'com' tree to a temporary
location. Local Refresh: Package explorer shows src to be empty. Ok!

3. Move the 'com' tree back again, local refresh. A new package
'com.xyz.product2' is shown

The delta issued on the second refresh is:
Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN}
	Product1[*]: {CHILDREN}
		src[*]: {CHILDREN}
			com[+]: {}
			com.xyz[+]: {}
			com.xyz.product1[+]: {}
			com.xyz.product2[+]: {}

Proposed patch

Changed DeltaProcessor#elementAdded(...) and #elementRemoved(...) to not
add/removed subpackages if they are excluded.
Created attachment 12482
Regression tests

Added regression tests
ExclusionFilterTests#testCreateExcludedAndIncludedPackages() and
#testRemoveExcludedAndIncludedPackages()
Patch doesn't work if deeper child folders are included again. Check for 
inclusion should only apply to local folder, and should recurse in children in 
case an inclusion filter is specified.

Need to be reworked, won't be ready for RC3.
Verified that the same problem exists in 2.1.3. So this is not a regression 
comparing to 2.1.3.

Better patch

Continue the recursion for packages.
Incorrect patch was attached in comment #5.

Changed DeltaProcessor.elementAdded(...) and elementRemoved(...) to not 
consider subpackages. And changed updateCurrentDeltaAndIndex(...) to continue 
the recursion in the case of a package fragment.

Added regression tests 
ExclusionPatternTest.testCreateExcludedAndIncludedPackages() and 
testRemoveExceludedAndIncludedPackages().
Please backport to 3.0.1
Targeting 3.0.1
Backported fix and tests to R3_0_maintenance.
Verified for 3.0.1 RC1


Java element delta from refresh contains excluded package
