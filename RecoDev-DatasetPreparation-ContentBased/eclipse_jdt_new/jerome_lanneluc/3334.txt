Types hierarchy view does not show all subclasses which makes it very confusing.
	Create 2 projects P1 and P2.
	Change the P2 class path to depend on P1.
	Create two classes each C1 (in P1) and C2 (in P2) subclass of C1.
	Export C2 to a jar and delete it from the workspace.
	Add the jar as a external jar in P2.

	Open Type "C2".
	The hierarchy view will show Object->C1->C2. (Good).
	Select C1, Popup menu -> "Focus on C1".
	C2 will desapear from the view.	Why? It is still a subclass of C1.

NOTES:

		Tried it with internal jar and did not work as well.

Index selector was incorrectly handling workspace scopes. Changed it so that 
the focus is visible from everywhere in the case of a workspace scope.
