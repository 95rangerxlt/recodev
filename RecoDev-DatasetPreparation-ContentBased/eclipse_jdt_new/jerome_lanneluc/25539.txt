Build 20021029

When searching for references to Throwable (type references), I got back 
inaccurate matches, such as:

org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.parser.SingleCompletionTest.run(Class, 
String)

org.eclipse.core.runtime.IStatus.getException()

(got 51 inaccurate matches in total)

Forgot to mention the search was not case sensitive.

There were 2 problems:
- the pattern didn't need resolve, but since SingleNameReferences were found we 
resolved only the current unit. This caused binary types of another potential 
match to be cached in the LookupEnvironment and thus when resolving this other 
potential match, a duplicate type error was reported, and resolution aborted.
- in presence of binary types and their member types (e.g. A.class and 
A$B.class), 2 resolution were done. The second failed with a duplicate type 
error.

Fixed first problem by resolving all potential matches at once if we find out 
that resolution is needed late in the game.

Fixed second problem by remembering that a unit had already been resolved.


Unexpected inaccurate search results
