Proposed patch
Changed NameLookup.acceptType(IType, int) to return true if all flags were 
requested.
Changed ClassFileMatchLocator.locateMatches(...) to pass in the info (a 
ClassFileReader) to cacheBinaryType(...) so that the element doesn't have to 
be opened.
Please backport to 3.0.1
Targeting 3.0.1
Backported fix to R3_0_maintenance
Verified for 3.0.1 RC1


Search should not populate Java model cache
