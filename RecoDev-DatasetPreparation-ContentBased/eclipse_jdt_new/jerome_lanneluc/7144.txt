Build 20011219

I have the SDK plugins in my workspace as binary self-hosting projects.
I have only org.eclipse.ui as source.

- open type on VMPreferencePage (in JDT debug UI)
- it takes a while, then the hierarchy shows just Object
- open type on TemplatePreferencePage (also in JDT debug UI)
- the hierarchy shows PreferencePage / TemplatePreferencePage (but not Object)

I have the SDK plugins in my workspace as binary self-hosting projects.
I have only org.eclipse.ui as source.

- open type on VMPreferencePage (in JDT debug UI)
- it takes a while, then the hierarchy shows just Object
- open type on TemplatePreferencePage (also in JDT debug UI)
- the hierarchy shows PreferencePage / TemplatePreferencePage (but not Object)
Martin, please investigate.
reproducable with 20109. as described: All in binary except eclipse.ui
The hierarchy of TemplatePreferencePage (jdt.ui) has no super type.
(should be PreferencePage of eclipse.ui)

move to jdt.core
TemplatePreferencePage was found to be outside the hierarchy because it's 
superclass binding was not computed at the time we ask.

Changed HiearchyResolver to eliminate the types outside the hierarchy just 
before reporting the hierarchy to the hierarchy builder (i.e. after all 
bindings have been resolved).
The other day I ran into a case where it couldn't resolve the hierarchy, and 
therefore couldn't do F3 or F4 when I had selected a type name.
It would be good to do the VA/Java-style cheat where if you have a capitalized 
word selected, it assumes it's a type name even if it can't be resolved, and 
does the same as Open Type on the name.



Could you please enter a separate bug against open on selection?
Thanks.
