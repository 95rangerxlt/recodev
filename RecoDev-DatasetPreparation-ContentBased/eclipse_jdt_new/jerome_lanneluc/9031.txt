NPE in AbstractMethodDeclaration.compilationResult
We were trying to report a warning during parsing. To achieve this, we were 
trying to get a compilation result from the reference context. Unfortunately, 
the scope of the reference context (a method declaration) is null until we 
start resolving.

Fixed by passing the compilation result to the nonExternalizedStringLiteral
(...) method.
