Build 20020423

1. With an existing selfhosting workspace, I checked out a project that didn't
have Java nature.
2. I right clicked on the project, went to "Properties," and added Java nature
to the project's capabilities.
3. Now if I click the "Open Type" button and type the name of a type which
exists in the project, the type doesn't show up in the dialog. I can navigate to
the type in the packages view, so I know it exists.

<speculation>Could it be that we're not indexing projects which have Java nature
added on the fly?</speculation>

Jerome - is this us or the platform not notifying us ?
The configure()/deconfigure() methods would not index the project/remove the 
index when called.
Fixed.


"Open type" doesn't find types in project with Java nature added
