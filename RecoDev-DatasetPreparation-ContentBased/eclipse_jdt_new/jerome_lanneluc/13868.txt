Win32 0412 Integration

I am not sure how to describe the various problems I am now seeing since I 
have seen a variety of problems.  However, they all seem to have a common 
theme.  The underlying Java Model for a given class is not being updated 
properly as new methods are added or methods are changed.

The two examples that I am consistently running across now are:
1) Search for a given method, and double click in the Task window to bring up 
the java source.  Add a new method to the file.  I noticed that the Outline 
view nor the Type Hierarchy were updated with the new method.  The subclasses 
which did not implement the abstract method were not flagged with errors.

2) Modified a method signature by adding a new parameter.  I received two 
errors in my task where classes were using the API.  The first one was changed 
without a problem.  However the second one, when I try to use Context Assist, 
the method is showing 2 parameters instead of 3, and the new API added above 
does not appear as an option.  After closing the window with the added 
parameter, the Context Assist is showing 3 parameters but the new method is 
not appearing as a valid choice.  

Its almost like there are multiple working copies and what I see is the wrong 
one.  So when I close the window and re-open the file, everything is ok.

I think the problem is related to the fact that I marked all my source read-
only.  I open the source as read-only then modify the properties to disable 
the read-only flag.  The editor changes to writable, but I notice that my 
changes are not showing up in the Outline view.
The internal buffer implementation used to cache the read-only flag. It now 
checks the underlying resource.


Java Model not updated properly
