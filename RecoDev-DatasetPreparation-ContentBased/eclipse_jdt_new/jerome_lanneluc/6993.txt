Build 20011211 + latest JDTCORE head


1.	Create project P1
2. 	Create folder 'txt' not on the classpath
3.	Add compilation unit Outside.java using class wizard (location P1/txt, 
no package)
4.	Notice the package view does not refresh.

// would indicate wrong delta got fired

5.	Force close/reopen project P1
6.	Package view shows 'Outside.java' under P1/txt

7.	Delete 'Outside.java'
8. 	Package view refreshes ok
9.	Add compilation unit 'Outside.java' back to P1/txt (recreating it with 
class wizard)
10.	Wizard complains the type already exists

// would indicate the model info did not get flushed)

Fixed delta problem by changing the involved JavaModelOperations to not create 
deltas if the cu is not in the classpath (the delta processor creates the 
correct non-java resource delta).

Fixed model info problem by hooking in the WorkingCopy.destroy() method so that 
it closes the original element if it was not in the classpath.
