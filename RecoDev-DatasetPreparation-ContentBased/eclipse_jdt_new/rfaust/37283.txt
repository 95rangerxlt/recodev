- Insertion point: Whouldn't the wizard add _after_ the selected method? It is
currently not possible to add the elements as last
- Dialog resizing: The new controls should also get larger if the dialog window
resizes
- Can the select buttons be equal-sized?
- I would expect 'Select getters' and 'Select setters' to be additive (after
pressing 'getters' then 'setter' all elements are selected)

I think the having select getters and select setters not be additive is 
proper. There's already a select all which lets you accomplish the two of 
these together. However there is no "deselect getters" and "deselect setters". 

The insert pt. problem should be fixed in patch 4867 for bug 37384.

proposed enhancements.

- Moves buttons to the right side of the dialog.
- Removes "at cursor position" choice from insert position drop down.
Preselects element in drop down based on the method element with the nearest
offset in the editor (if available). Otherwise "as first method" is the
default.

small details I've seen:
- the config controls (lower part) have more indent than the tree viewer
(probably margin from the composite)

- in the following code, set cursor at position marked: In dialog, 'goo' is
preselected. That's wrong as the method is always inserted after.
----
public class X {
	int count;
	public foo(){
	
	}
	// cursor here |
	public goo() {
	}
}
---
- 'n' is used twice as mnemonic
- change the status line to '1 of 10 selected'

proposed fix.

Would you rather that the method foo() were preselected, or would you rather
that the method is inserted before the method selected in the insert point
combo? I changed the behavior so that it was inserted after the method selected
rather than before, as it seemed more natural. 

patch fixes problem with duplicate ALT modifiers. also adds n of n selected in
status area.
Created attachment 4893
proposed enhancements.

Fixes choice pre-selection when between methods like foo/goo.
Creates abstract class for resuse by other dialogs which takes advantage of
layout with a treeviewer paired with buttons on the right-hand side.
released the patch

The lower part still has more indent
The initialization of the combo still does not work. Set the cursor at th
beginning of a file.

Created attachment 4903
proposed fix.

Moves logic for entry pt to the SourceActionDialog class. Straightens out logic
for preselecting entry pt. so that it is never after the current cursor
position. Adds logic for preselecting entry pt. if a field is preselected in a
view (e.g. outline, package explorer) and action is chosen.
released patch.


Created attachment 4904
proposed fix.

Simplifies logic for calculating offsets in the case of editor available or
unavailable.
Fixes issue with default visibility of "public" not being set properly.

oops

same as prev attachment, but margins for inner composite are fixed so that
bottom of dialog is left-aligned with the treeviewer.

proposed enhancements: getter/setter, override, generate delegates source actions


+ fixes overlapped pnemonics in SourceActionDialog
+ adds create comment checkbox to SourceActionDialog
+ uses SourceActionDialog for GenerateDeleGateMethodAction
  + adds entry pt. combo & create comment options
+ separates action/operation for generating delegates by creating
GenerateDelegateMethodOperation class
+ changes status in generate delegates dialog to "n of n selected"
+ changes status in override dialog to "n of n selected"
+ refactors construction and operation of override dialog
+ fixes SourceActionDialog message naming
+ changes the way SourceActionDialog determines methods in a file by passing
type
+ removes insert pt combo from being displayed when override dialog is invoked
by AnonymousTypeCompletionProposal
+ moves logic for determining IJavaElement to SourceActionDialog, rather than
just returning the offset position or combo index
X AnonymousTypeCompletionPropsoal doesn't respect the "create comment combo box
selection choice b/c StubUtility.getMethodComment requires a valid
ICompilationUnit to create a method comment, which isn't available when working
with BinaryMethod types
