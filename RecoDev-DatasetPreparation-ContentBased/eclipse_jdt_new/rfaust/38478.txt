What behavior would you like to see? Displaying a error or warning to the user 
when they press OK? Renaming the getter/setter auto-generated method choices 
so there's not a collision?
I would suggest to have a error in the status line, so you can't press OK (same
as the delegate method wizard does).
I need some advice for this one. The validate method for 
AddGetterSetterSelectionStatusValidator gets the 
SourceField/GetterSetterEntries as input. These are distinct from the labels 
generated for them, which are the names of the getter/setter methods. I guess 
the only way to do this is to regen the method names from within the validate 
method and see if there's an overlap. I can't override the input from the 
CheckBoxTreeViewer b/c the updateOK method uses a bunch of fields.
