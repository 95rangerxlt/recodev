The JUnit wizard title is currently "New". It should probably be set to 
be "New JUnit X" where X is test case or test suite. This would be consistent 
with the wizard titles for creating a new class or interface.

agreed - pls fix
Created attachment 4614
proposed fix.

Changed titles to "New JUnit Test Case" and "New JUnit Test Suite." This begs
the question whether or not the spacing should be TestCase and TestSuite as it
is in the tree for New->Java->JUnit->TestCase/TestSuite. We should do them both
the same way. Which is correct?
Must be consistent with the wizard selection dialog: TestSuite
But maybe we should change it there to Test Suite. Erich?
we should use spaces eveywhere -> Test Suite and Test Case.
released patch. I also changed the wizard labels > 20030417
