Agree.
all code generation methods do this. I think its good practice.
question of taste. i don't like seeing superfluous code.
added in attachment 5707 to bug 39907. note this override only works for the 
default constructor call to super()


create constructors from fields: calling 'super()' is superfluous and should be optional [code manipulation]
