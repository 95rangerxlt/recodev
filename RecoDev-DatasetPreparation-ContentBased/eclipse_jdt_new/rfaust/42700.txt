proposed enhancements.

+ Adds ability value editing to the Externalize Strings Wizard TableViewer.
+ Chanes Edit Key dialog to allow editing of both key and value, and changes
button label to "Edit Key and Value..."
+ Removes quotes around values displayed in the table viewer, so that when
editing, user doesn't have to remember to add these in. They were removed
anyway in the properties file, so the behavior is not changed.
The review of the patch:
- after applying the patch the NLSRefactoringTests have compile errors
- button "Edit Key and Value..." should be named "Edit..."
- the edit dialog is missing mnemonics for the to entry fields.
  (you can set a mnemonic for the label)
- when using public fields (like in KeyValuePair) we usually don't prefix
  the name with an f.
- NLSInputDialog: can you please comment on the TODO tag. This seems duplicated
  code.
- OpenEditButton: why do you send out two fViewer.update message instead of 
  one containing both properties.

And a question: the inserting of an entry into the properties file in 
a "sorted" manner will be provided as a separate patch ?

proposed fix.

+ NLSRefactoringTests just tests removing quotes, which is no longer desired
behavior in dialog. Suggest removing these test cases.
+ Renamed button to Edit with 'd' as a mnemonic.
+ Added Mnemonics for entry fields in NLSinputdialog (k/v)
+ Change public fields to private and encapsulated (KeyValuePair)
+ Removed TODO tag and replaced with validation method to ensure there are no
white spaces in keys.
+ Sends one update msg. instead of multiple to viewer.

* Inserting of entries into a sorted manner in the properties file should be
put into a separate patch.
Patch released to HEAD.
