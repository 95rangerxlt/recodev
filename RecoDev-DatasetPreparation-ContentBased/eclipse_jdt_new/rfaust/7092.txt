'copy trace' is there - and it's cool
but the original feature request was for the list of failures, 
which is more useful.

needs clarification. You want to be able to right click on the failure list and 
choose copy? So if you click on the test case name you copy the whole list of 
methods that failed to the clipboard? Or if you click on a method, you just get 
the name of that method copied to the clipboard? Or there is a single choice no 
matter what you click on which gives you the entire list of method name 
failures that gets copied to the clipboard?
Suggest a separate action: "Copy Failure List" that is independent of the 
selection in the list.
i think it's more intutitive to select the failures you want to copy, and press 
ctrl+c, rather that have the action always copy _all_ of them

proposed fix.

Adds a context menu selection for "Copy Failure List" to the Failure Run View
in JUnit. The list of failures gets copied to the system clipboard. Currently
only implemented for the Failures tab, should this also be implented in the
Hierarchy tab?
