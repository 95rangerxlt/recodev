While starting to run our tests for Gerrit changes, we got two test failures which were caused by the missing 'org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility' bundle.

I replaced the deprecated code that caused the failures, but we have to investigate whether other stuff is used from the compatibility layer.

Sarika, we should do this for RC1, so that we can delete the compatibility layer in 4.6.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=2bf6c75a08a17ddbaac9a876567e4177431def84
Sarika, we have to do this during RC2, see comment 1.
There is no reference in any java file but the test launch file has an entry like this :
<stringAttribute key="selected_target_plugins" value="org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.registry@default:false, 

Does the gerrit test use the same launch file to run the tests ?

/org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests/JDT Debug Test Suite.launch

No, Gerrit executes the org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests.AutomatedSuite.

Verified that we don't use any deprecated method which will invoke Compatibility layer.


Check org.eclipse.jdt.launching for further references to org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility* bundles
