There where some API changes for JDK 8, e.g. additional intermal parameters for the language changes.

As an example for type annotations in
 org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ast.TypeReference

changed the signature of the method:
  public static final TypeReference baseTypeReference(int baseType, int dim)

to
  public static final TypeReference baseTypeReference(int baseType, int dim, Annotation [][] dimAnnotations)


This breaks for instance the popular compiler extension lombok:   http://code.google.com/p/projectlombok/issues/detail?id=597 

I suggest to add compatibility functions for this like e.g.:
public static final TypeReference baseTypeReference(int baseType, int dim) {
	// compatibility function
	return  baseTypeReference(baseType, dim, null);
}

This here is just an example. These kind of compatibility functions are very simple and help to prevent the breaking of potentially many external plugins and rise the acceptance for the new eclipse version. 

I know this is an internal package, but you should be well aware that many external plugins around compilers and and languages (quite a popular topic nowadays) directly use your nice compiler APIs, especially the AST.

I kindly request to add at least this function because lombok is very important and works fine with this additional method ;)

Shankha, please take a look.

Patch

Test results are all green.
I agree to the terms and conditions on http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CoO.php.
Fix released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e1051acac48de2e59e4c3d2d0f46898b4067bf9a.

Thanks Shankha - I eliminated the change in CompletionParser as it is not
required strictly speaking.
