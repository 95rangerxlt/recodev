Why does the Refactor > Generalize Type ... menu option always appear on non-
java files and when choosing it nothing happens.

For example I have a file named 'ccccccc' in a java project and it can 
apparantly be refactored in this way.

*** Bug 47205 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The action is always enabled after it gets enabled once. Problem is that the 
else case in selectioChanged is missing setting enablement=false;

Frank, the action should only be enabled if the selected element is

- a field
- a method and the method has a return type.
I fixed it and released it to HEAD.


Refactor > Generalize Type... always an option and does nothing.
