- create a selfhosting eclipse workspace that has all plugins as binary except 
  jdt.core from HEAD.
- open CompilationUnitSorter, and select the first parameter from 
  method 'sort'. (ICompilationUnit compilationUnit)
- Generalize type

observe: progress reporting stays a very long time on Analyzing... The progess 
indicator doesn't move at all. Then it jumps to 2/3 of progress reporting.

I improved it a little bit when recoding the search engine calls. But it is 
still not optimal. One problem seems to be that you pass a sub progress 
monitor which takes one tick from its parent to a sub operation which takes 
quite a while. 
Frank, are you doing somethin for M6 here ?
OK, postponing to M7. 
Got fixed for M7.
