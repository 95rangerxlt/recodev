Smart indentation on return always indents to column after square brakets:

public class Test {
	private void helper2(boolean[] booleans) {
		if (booleans[0]) {

		}
	}
}

With default Eclipse code formatter settings, set the caret to after one of the
"]" and press Enter.

Expected: the new line is indented by 2 more tabs than the line above
Was: new line is indented on column (with spaces)

Fix

The patch does not work for me: it still adds spaces instead of tabs. Also, please make sure that pressing 'Enter' before the ']' also works.
Forgot this: please also add a test case.

Handles continuation after ']' and '['. Also attached tests.

One can argue that inserting spaces to align the closing square bracket is a feature, so lets leave that for now.

What's still not working is that Ctrl+I changes the indentation again.

That's a separate issue covered by bug 330556.

Committed the patch but with fixed indentation (the case statement was indented to far).
Available in builds >= N20101201-2000.
All recently made indent fixes had to be reverted due to several regressions (bug 331028, bug 330556 and bug 331734).
Committed Rajesh's modified patch (patch will be attached soon).
