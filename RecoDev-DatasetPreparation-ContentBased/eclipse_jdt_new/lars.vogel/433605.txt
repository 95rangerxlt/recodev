The same plug-in that defines the default colors: The Java syntax colors are declared in org.eclipse.jdt.ui's contribution to the org.eclipse.ui.themes extension point.
https://git.eclipse.org/r/26006
Uploaded https://git.eclipse.org/r/26006 patch set 3:

Removed the dependency on org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme. This is not necessary, since all JDT functionality works fine without that bundle.

Fixed Andrea's name in CSS header comment. Lars, please fix that in other changes you released as well.

Fixed formatting of plugin.xml

Fixed content_assist_completion_replacement colors in CSS. The colors were barely visible in patch set 2.

Bugs in themes handling:
- The Dark theme overrides all Java editor syntax coloring color changes on restart. Changes to other font attributes are properly saved and retained.
- On the Syntax Coloring preference page, "Restore Defaults" doesn't restore the defaults of the current theme, but the platform defaults. After a restart, the Dark theme default colors are applied again (by the first bug).

I still see too many rendering issues with the dark theme to declare it usable (on Windows 7), e.g.:
- Tree twisties not visible
- Gray filter text in search fields hard to read
- Java editor breadcrumb has a better background right after switching to the Dark theme than after a restart
- EGit resource decorations render dirty resources black-on-dark
- Disabled tree background too bright (Clean... dialog)
- Gray spacer in Open Resource... dialog
- Selections hard to read in owner-drawn Trees and Tables (Content Assist, Outline)
- Chaotic text rendering of standard widgets, see e.g. Editors prefs page

Thanks for the adjustments to the Gerrit review. 

For most of the issues you mentioned (plus the bad looking gif icons) we have separate issues. Having a dark theme in the Eclipse SDK helps us to solve already a bunch of issues and we plan to address more with Eclipse 4.5.

OK to release, but only if bug 434485 is fixed. Otherwise, users lose important functionality. We better go with bad defaults than letting the user spend time with configuring colors and then delete user data on restart.
Moving to RC2 because blocking bug 434485 is still open.

Should that be in Build id: I20140521-2000? Just tested and it does not look like it.

Yes, you can verify that yourself by looking into the jdt.ui bundle or by looking at the tag on the Git commit.


>  Just tested and it does not look like it.

I only reviewed the code change and didn't verify it. So, maybe it is no longer working due to the other changes that were made, e.g. to fix bug 434485.
Bug 435488 is the culprit.
(In reply to Dani Megert from comment #12)
> Bug 435488 is the culprit.

Yes, found that also out. Just for my learning how did you test this? I reverted the commit and started a runtime Eclipse with the reverted change. Did you do the same thing?

I started Eclipse and looked at the .log.
Fixed more typos and put ext.pt. contribution close to other theme extensions:

The Dark theme works in I20140522-1330 but afterwards users can't override e.g. the background color (see bug 434485 comment 38). As outlined before, this is a no go. If this is not fixed then we have to revert the changes.

It seems to work in general, but not for the background (see bug 435574). Given the dark/black background is the key element of the Dark theme a user most likely won't want to change the background.
