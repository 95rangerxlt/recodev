Given (with colored labels enabled):

public class Dummy {
	int field;
	{
		field= 1;
		field= field; //first is write, second is read
		System.out.println(field);
	}
}


1. select 'field'
2. Search > Occurrences in File > Identifier

=> third entry in Search view renders both matches as write access, but the second one is a read access.
