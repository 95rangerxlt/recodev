3.0RC2 / I200406111814

Using the class 

public class Foo {
    private int foo(int foo) {
        int next = 0;

        //some useless comment
        if (next == 1)
            return foo + 1;
        //another useless comment
        else
            return foo + next / 2;
    }
}

If you trigger the Quick fix ""Change else statement to block" on the else
statement the "another useless comment" gets removed

(Is it OK to set severity to critical on such a bug? Is losing a comment is
"loss of data"?)

Lowering severity since this isn't critical due to the fact that workaround 
exists. Furthermore this can easily be undone by pressing Ctrl+Z.
Martin, can you please investigate.

patch

proposed fix (in jdt.core)
Sorry, I can't see if the patch fixes anoter very related problem with quickfix.
The comment is only eaten if "results" is actually used after the comment.

Thanks 

-Anders

public class Quickfixtest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String results = doAthing();
        
        //comment to be eaten
        
        doSomething(results);
    }

    private static String doAthing() throws java.rmi.RemoteException {
        return null;
    }
    private static void doSomething(String results) {   }
}

Andres, this does not released to the problem in comment 4 which is a bit more
trickier. I filed a new bug report for that one (bug 77133)



quickfix "Change else statement to block" removes comment
