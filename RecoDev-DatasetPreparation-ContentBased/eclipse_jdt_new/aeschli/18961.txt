Hi,

I'm working on a class in package A and 
want to create a class in package B in 
the Java Browsing perspective.
I select package B in the Packages view
go into the Types view, click the right 
mouse button and select New Class.
The new class is created in package A
instead of package B.

Environment:
Windows 2000
JSDK 1.4.0
Eclipse F2

it works by default correctly when you select a type in Package B.
The wizard framework should us the input of a ViewPart when there is no 
selection. However, ViewParts have no notion of input currently.
So we cannot fix this for 2.0
It is not that critical since the new class wizard shows you the container 
package.
*** Bug 18503 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This is not only a [browsing] problem - changed summary again. To initialize our
wizards from
1. the current selection
2. the input of the currently selected view
3. ...
we would need API to get the input from a view part.

Moving to Platform UI for comment.
We have no plans to add the notion of input to views.
Recommend a JDT-only solution.

If we don't get support from platform then we can only change our wizards not to
initialize from the current editor input and not use the previous values.

This is how the platform wizards behave: if you repeat the scenario to create a
file or folder then the wizard is not initalized (i.e. the correct parent folder
is not selected).


I suggest the following fix for this PR:
Our wizards use the active editor input even if the editor is not the active
part. We should change this: if the active editor is not the active part then we
do not initialize the wizards. This will make our wizards behave like the
platform wizards and will prevent the user from adding something to a wrong
package/folder.

Moving to MA as discussed.

The wizard now takes the input only from the viewPart in focus.
If no selection available, the input of the viewPart is taken:

Intruduced new mixin interface for IViewParts: IViewPartInputProvider.
Added to Browsing views, Package explorer, Type hierarchy, Java editor + 
Outliner.
