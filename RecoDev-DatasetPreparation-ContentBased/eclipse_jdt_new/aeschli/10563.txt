For 2.0 we should make the JavaElementSorter, MethodsViewerFilter API.
Martin, along with the API please
- also make the MethodFilterAction reusable (currently EG and I copied it)
- rename the classes to Member*
sorter now in API package (>20020307)
for the filters, after discussion with dirk, implemented 
MemberFilterActionGroup, that contains Action & filter including wiring.
Changed Outline, Type hierarchy, Browsers and Package view to use the sction 
group. Planed to make this API.
moving to db to move the action group to the API packages if it follows the 
action group guidlines
Class doesn't conform to the class ActionGroup provided by the workbench. 
Please have a look at ActionGroup or at specific action groups in the 
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions package.
adapted & moved to API > 20020418
