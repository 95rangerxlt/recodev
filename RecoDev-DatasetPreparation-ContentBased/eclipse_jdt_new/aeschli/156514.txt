'Split && condition' is fully semantics preserving, so I would expect that 'Split || condition' is as well, but it isn't:

In ...
    void split(boolean a, boolean b) {
        if (a || b) {
            System.out.println("a or b");
        }

... , the body is changed to:
        if (a) {
            System.out.println("a or b");
        }
        if (b) {
            System.out.println("a or b");
        }

If a and b are true, then "a or b" is printed twice.

Expected result:
        if (a) {
            System.out.println("a or b");
        } else if (b) {
            System.out.println("a or b");
        }
