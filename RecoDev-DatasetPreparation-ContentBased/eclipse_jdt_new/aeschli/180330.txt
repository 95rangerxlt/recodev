Build ID: I20070323-1616

The following code declares a public class C in a file A.java:

// A.java
public class \u0043 {}

An error is flagged on the line:
  "The public type C must be defined in its own file"
  
The Quick Assist does not offer to rename the file.

Rename the class "C" instead of "\u0043" and Quick Assist does offer to rename the compilation unit.

In both cases the error vanishes when the file is renamed to C.java.

The quick assist should be consistent for both versions of the class name.
