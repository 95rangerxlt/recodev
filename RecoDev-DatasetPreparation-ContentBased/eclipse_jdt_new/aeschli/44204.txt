Methods should be able to be promoted to an implemented interface.  IE

interface SomeThing {
  public DoDad getDoDad();
}

class MyThing implements Something {
  private DoDad doDad=new DoDad();
  public DoDad getDoDad() { return doDad; }
  public void setDoDad(DoDad dad) { this.doDad=dad; }
              ^^^^^^^^
}

Ctrl-1 on the ^'d should produce 'Declare in interface 'Something''.  if more
than on interface, multiple options should be given, much like what import does.  

This enhancement would save time copying, pasting and trimming.

I was  considing this idea some time ago. I hesitated because What I was afraid
that the list of possible super interfaces and classes would become too long.
Quicm fixes should have noit too many suggestions, otherwise they become
unusable (in my opinioun).
Adding an intermediate dialog to choose the target type also isn't that optimal.
