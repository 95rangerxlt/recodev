The Java Build Path/Order page in the project properties dialog always grows 
the table to show all items.
In a workspace with many source folders the properties dialog grows so tall 
that you can no longer see the ok/cancel buttons.
I noticed this while using WSDD (Eclipse 1.0 based) to create P3ML bundles. 
P3ML consists of about 20 bundles with each bundle living in a separate source 
folder.
Note that the resize only happens when the dialog is reopened. If you create 
source folders in the properties dialog and then switch to the order page you 
will see scroll bars.
Also, it seems that this only happens when there is a large number of source 
folders. When I reference a lot of projects the height of the order page is 
limited and the table shows scroll bars.
