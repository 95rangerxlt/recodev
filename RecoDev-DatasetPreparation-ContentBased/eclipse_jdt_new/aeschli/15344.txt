build 0502

- go to the Java perspective, ensure that you have no resources loaded
- click the toolbar button for one of the following wizards:
   -> java package
   -> java class
   -> java interface
   -> scrapbook page
- a prompter is shown that says "A project must be created first.  Opening the 
New Configurable Project wizard?"
- "Opening" should be "Open"

I realize that this is minor but it's jarring to read.  The fix seems trivial.
