Right now it just uses Object for any new instance variables it adds, which is
quite useless. In fact, if the variable ought to have been a primitive type then
this behavior is outright wrong.

Move to JDT/UI as quick fix is a feature of JDT/UI.
This only happens if the original (unfixed) assignment stmt has a 'this.'
preceding the name of the variable. 
There is a guessing of the variable type.
This might fail if there are otehr problems in the code that prevent the 
compiler to correctly resolve the type.

Could you send me reproducable case?
The 'this.' case has been fixed > 20021010


The autocorrector should infer the type from the source variable when adding an instance variable to fic an unknown variable name problem in an assignment statement [quick fix]
