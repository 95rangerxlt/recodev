The Hover Helps don't seem to match the Java Code Formatter anymore.

Hover help for option Clear all blank lines in Preferences->Java->Code 
Formatter page seems to be obsolete as it refers to an option "Preserve one" 
that is not in the panel. 

The same occurs for the Style tab: the opposite of Compact assignment should be 
Normal assignment
according to the hover help

We should remove the tooltips alltogether.
Tooltips should only show up for items in toolbars.
tooltips are already removed since the rework.
