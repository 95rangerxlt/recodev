/**
 * @param <ELEMENT> the element
 */
public class A<ELEMENT> {
	ELEMENT e;
}

Searches for ELEMENT give an "Operation Unavailable" dialog. E.g. the
constructor of FindReferencesAction restricts available element types to not
include ITypeParameter. Depends on bug 81190.

We shouldn't add this to the search dialog (we don't support locals either). So
as soon as 81190 is fixed this should work
Yes, this is not to be supported in the dialog.

However, the find actions currently enumerate the java element types they
support. Once bug 81190 is fixed, ITypeParameter must be added to the lists of
supported element types in all find actions.
*** Bug 83438 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
If we want to search for it, there also needs to be a 'type parameter' category
in the 'search for' box. Having a Java element is not enough, the search dialog
must also show the element by name and have the correct 'search for' category set.

I agree with Dirk that we should treat type parameters in search like local
variables. No dialog changes, no search support. Mark occurences is good enough
here.

-> no action

Martin I agree regarding the dialog, but disagree regarding searching using the
actions from the context menu. For example select a local variable in code and
press Ctrl+Shift+G to search for references. This produces a normal search
result. (No mark occurrences). We should provide the same for type paramters.
