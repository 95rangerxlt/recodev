1. Have this code:
	IDocument document;
	try {
//		document.getLineInformation(3);
	} catch (<POS1>BadLocationException e) {<POS2>
	}

2. Error: Unreachable catch block
3. Quick fix when at POS1: Replace catch block with throws 
   Quick fix offered when at POS2: remove catch clause

Both offers (or at least the removal) should be available not only inside the 
catch clause, but starting with the catch keyword (or even throughout the 
exception block?)

Plus: the catch clause removal should also be offered as quick assist for 
unchecked exceptions.

using "Surround with try/catch block" too often can lead to unreadable code that
you want to refactor, also a try block introduces new scope that could lead to a
new cycle of refactoring. 

i would add to the last statement that the catch clause removal should also be
offered as quick assist regardless of is exception checked or unchecked.
fixed > 20030822

Fixed the position issue.
The remove quick fix/assist is now offered on all catch blocks.
As a side effect 'Replace catch block with throws' is offered an all catch
blocks as well. (maybe I'll remove this at a later moment)
