Under Preferences->Compiler->Compliance and Classfiles, set Compiler compliance 
level to 1.4 yet Java framework continues to complain about keyword "assert" in 
java sources.  Attempting to override by deselecting "Use default compliance 
settings" does not work.  (My JDK is JDK1.4.1).

Assertions are only available once the source level is raised to 1.4 
(equivalent to -source 1.4). 

Ok to close ?
This still doesn't work.  Try raising source level to 1.4 and the "apply" 
button is disabled; says that asserts not allowed.  It's as if 1.3 & 1.4 source 
level selection are mixed up.
I see your problem. When not using defaults, you have to set:
- .class file compatibility: 1.4
- source compatibility:      1.4
- assert as identifier:      error

Moving to JDT UI, since the message for the 'assert' setting is probably not 
super intuitive.
Martin, can we improve this by saying that assert are only allowed if source 
and class is 1.4.
I'm not sure if I understood the confussion.
The error and warning messages see to make sense to me. Phillipe, which message
did you think was not intuitive?
I think when user is intending to enable assertions, it isn't obvious that he 
needs to change 3 settings. If changing the compliance, and source level, one 
has to change the assert mode and then the target level.

I suspect an enable assertion is what most people want (do whatever it takes to 
enable them). Not super critical though.
I think the 'Report 'assert' as indentifier' is very confusing.
I changed this to 'Disallow identifiers called 'assert''
