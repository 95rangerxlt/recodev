The hover help is opposite the behavior of the checkbox.  It should say 
something like "When No, ..."


FWIW, I find the current wording a bit odd, i.e., 'When Yes...', but that is 
another issue.

Hover help for else if checkbox (says the opposite of checkbox behavior)
There should be no hover help in this case.
Tooltips should only be used in toolbars.

I think we already have removed the tooltips. Martin pls confirm and dispose.

Tooltips have been removed.
Label has been changed (Insert new line between 'else if')

TVT: Hover help for "Keep else if on the same line" is incorrect (backwards)
