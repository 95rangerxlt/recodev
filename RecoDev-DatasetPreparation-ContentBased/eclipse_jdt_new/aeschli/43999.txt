A new feature was added in 3.0 to show all the inner classes.  However in some 
cases (for example when you are implementing a large number of event 
listeners) this makes the Outline view very difficult to use because it 
becomes very cluttered.

Also, the word "Anonymous" is quite long and comes at the front so that 
typically the useful information (the class name) is scrolled out of view.  
Could the class name be used instead (e.g. ControlListener$1)?

Just a thought, but a "collapse all" button might be sufficient (and consistent
with other views).  That at least collapses any extra space used by this
feature, leaving only the + boxes.
