Try opening the hierarchy view on the org.eclipse.ui.internal package.  You 
end up with tons of types.  It's not obvious why many of the types are being 
included.

I have a working set with only 10 types from this package selected.  Yet there 
are hundreds of types in the package hierarchy view, including interfaces 
which doen't even have implementors.  So you get all of these root interfaces 
which are grayed out with no children.  Even the class "Action" is showing up 
under Object, grayed out, without any subtypes present in the working set.
