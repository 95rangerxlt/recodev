I can't find a way to set the default javadoc command offered by the javadoc
wizard. Now it offers me two choices, both of which correspond to two different
versions of Java 1.4 that I have uninstalled long ago. I've entered in it
/usr/bin/javadoc and /usr/lib/j2.../bin/javadoc uncountable times, and although
the correct command is then used, the next time I start the dialog it still only
offers me the old settings.

I greped my metadata dir for one of the two current options, and I found the
following two matches:
.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs:command=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-ibm/bin/javadoc
.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/dialog_settings.xml:             <item
key="javadoc_command_history"
value="/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-ibm/bin/javadoc:/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-sun/bin/javadoc"/>

In case it matters, I've been converting this workspace along since Eclipse 2.1,
passing through 3.0 and a couple 3.1 release candidates, and finally 3.1. Now
I'm using Eclipse 3.1.1.

I think I remember that at some point I found a way to select the default
command, but that might have been with a long unavailable configuration UI.

This works for me on Windows, with Eclipse 3.1.
The location where the settings are stored is
.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/dialog_settings.xml
It should be updated on ok and cancel.

Maybe this location is read-only on your system?
I should have write access to the whole Eclipse installation as my current user.
Especially to the .metadata directory, as it lies beneath my home directory.

If there are Eclipse-specific write permissions, please let me know, and I'll
check them.
See the workspace I attached to bug #115526. It suffers from the same problem.
Eclipse decided that /usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/bin/javadoc was the command to use,
and if I change it to /usr/bin/javadoc it will swich back to the former when
opening the wizard, even though /usr/bin/javadoc works just fine.

Oh, and if you need the metadata corresponding to the aforementioned workspace,
just let me know if I may post it as an attachment, or if I should rather upload
it to an FTP. The FTP option won't be permanent, though.
