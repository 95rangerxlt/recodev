1) open Java Browsing Perspective
2) select a type in the type list view
-> editor is opened
3) select a method in the method list view
-> highlight range in editor is updated

4) open type hierarchy on that type and dock the hierarchy view
5) select a method in the hierarchy view
-> selection in the method list view is updated, editor is not affected

6) select  a super type in the hierarchy view
-> selection in the type list view is updated, editor is not affected

I would expect that in steps 5 and 6 the editor is also updated.

Correction:
Step 5 works OK.

This is a problem of the Type Hierarchy which sends an empty/null selection. It
should select the next/previous member or the type in the upper pane of the view.

The TH view itself is in an inconsistent state: the view is active (has focus)
but the selected type is gray.
