The new code formatter seems to do everything and cater to all tastes. 
However, it still does not cover one aspect of how I format code. I like to do 
for-s like this:

for (int i=1 ; i<10 ; i++) {}
(note spaces surrounding ;-s).

However, I do NOT want a space before ;-s anywhere else (ideology: in other 
places ; is a terminator, in the for it is a separator). The reason I can't do 
this is that the "space before ;" has been factored out to the level of 
control statements and cannot be set specifically for the for statement.

Trivial to add.
Silvio, could you please let me know if this is an issue for you to add such an
option in the code formatter preference page?
The fix is ready on my side.
Need to be added in the code formatter preference page.
Silvio, do you want me to release it?
No problem to add it. As long as you didn't change/remove any existing options, 
I don't need a patch. I will update the UI as soon as the new options has 
appeared.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression test added. By default, no space is added.

Verified for 3.0-M7 with build I200402102000.
Note that verification is only for jdt-core formatter.
In tested build, there's no way to set this option using UI!
=> reopen the bug and assign it to jdt-ui component as it is not actually 
resolved for users.

The constant is FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_SEMICOLON_IN_FOR.
Martin, I assigned it to you, because Silvio is back to school. It would be nice
to see this option in the UI for 3.0.
