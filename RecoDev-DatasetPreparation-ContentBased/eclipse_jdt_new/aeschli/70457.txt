In the case I write the javadoc comment and use the javadoc tak {@link ...} 
then there is the problem in the code assist - the code assist does not display 
the list of the members of the inner class in the case the enclosing master-
class of the inner class is not classified with the full package name. This 
happens if I write the references to some inner class members in the same 
package. For example I have
in package packageA the master class MasterA with the inner class InnerA with 
the method methodA().
If I write the javadoc outside the package packageA, then the code assist After 
typing "{@link Mast" and pressing Ctrl-Space completes the name to
"{@link packageA.MasterA", after pressing "." there comes the selection of the 
inner classes, I can select the class "InnerA" and then after pressing "#" 
comes the list of the methods from "InnerA" where I can select "methodA()" and 
come to the result "{@link packageA.MasterA.InnerA#methodA()" what is correct. 
BUT: If I am in the same package like the class "MasterA", then after 
typing "{@link Mast" and pressing Ctrl-Space completes the name not to
"{@link packageA.MasterA" but to "{@link MasterA" (this is still correct), 
after pressing "." there comes also the selection of the inner classes and I 
can select the class "InnerA" but then after pressing "#" comes nothing, no 
list at all, but there should come the list with "methodA()" and other methods 
from the inner class "InnerA".
This error was present also in the versions 2.x. This would be not so bad if 
there would be a possibility if I am in the same package to expand the class 
name "MasterA" to the full name, but this is not possible and sometimes the 
package paths are long and have to be found somewhere and copied to the place 
where writing the documentation.
