The following patch adds new UI to the Java editor template page so that templates of the Java and the SWT context can additionally specify if they only want to show up for
- statement completions
- member completions

The template completion processor has been adapted to follow the setting by using the new API from JavaCore.

Template API has been extended by 'custom attributes' which are pure key/value pairs.
Custom attributes are also persisted.

The patch is more a sketch of the solution. The UI should be polish or even redesigned.

What's also required is to add the new location attribute to the default templates.

Discussed this with Martin: for now we should just treat them as new template contexts that inherit from the Java context. He will provide a new patch.

patch using new context type
Thanks for this good patch!

I've committed it to HEAD with two changes:
- JavaContext.hasCompatibleContextType(Template) now uses 
  Template.matches(getKey(), id) instead of directly going to the id.
- improved template preference code that measures the width for the context
  column
- fixed broken test cases: the resolvers were missing for all non- Java context
  types
