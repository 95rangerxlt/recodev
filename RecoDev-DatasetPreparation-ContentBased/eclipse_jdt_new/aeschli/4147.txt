Whenever I launch a program, the progress dialog shows "Java Build Completed" 
even though it doesn't run the builder first (I have auto-build off).

	when you launch a program JDT performs a build of the project that contains the
	launched target. The rational is that the user almost always wants to run the
	latest code. For 2.0
	we should provide more control over the pre-launch build behaviour.
	We should provide options for:
	* build current project before launch/debug
	* build workspace before launch/debug
	* don't auto build.
	Both options should honor the workbench preference to auto save
	modified CUs.

	Agree.  But I originally filed the PR because it seemed like it was giving me this message
	without actually doing a build.  I'll see if I can reproduce this.

	speculating, could this be a consequence of not honoring the auto save preference
	of modified CUs. This means the builder was run but didn't build anything
	since the CUs were not saved.

eventually, DEBUG will implement the Java launching code, but we should still 
improve the existing behaviour
The progress monitor message issue should be fixed in the current build.
The problem was the improper use of the progress monitor (no subprogress 
monitor used)
For the other request (ask the user about building) there is another PR (4023)


Launcher progress has "Build Completed" (1GJ4MAY)
