Build 20021203

When you create a source folder on the Java Build Path page, you can specify 
an 'Output location'. It is by default 'Project Default'. 
On the bottom of this page you can specify a 'Build output folder'.

I find these namings not consistent. I would suggest to use 'Project default 
output location' for the later.
