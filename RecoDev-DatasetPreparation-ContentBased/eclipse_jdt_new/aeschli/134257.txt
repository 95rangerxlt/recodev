The New Java Project Wizard should allow choosing an Execution Environment as JRE. Currently, the page only shows the workbench JRE and Alternate JREs -- EEs have to be configured on the Java Build Path properties page or via context menu in the Package Explorer.

That's something we should look at for 3.3. It seems to me that for users its more intersting to specify the EE instaed of a specific JRE.

If we go in that direction, also the Installed JRE page promote EEs as top level elements. 
As well, when a Java project is bound to an EE (via JRE container), changing the EE should update the compliance setting. For example, I had a project bound to J2SE1.5, and later changed it to J2SE1.4. The compliance settings remained at 5.0 - I was confused when I could not run programs on a 1.4 VM due to incompatible settings (i.e. running 1.5 code on 1.4 VM). I exected that the compliance settings would have updated automatically.

I think you meant 3.3 M6, no 3.2 M6.

Sure, thanks. Fixed.

Cool, thanks martin!
Cool indeed. 

I've opened bug 176516 for comment 2 and bug 176517 for making EEs the default.
