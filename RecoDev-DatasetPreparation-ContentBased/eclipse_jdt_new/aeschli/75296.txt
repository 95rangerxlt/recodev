If a method already has javadoc @throws declared for SOME of the exceptions 
thrown from the method causing the Quick fix to appear, and I apply the quick 
fix, then my javadoc @throws declarations for ALL concerning exceptions are 
reset :-(

Cannot reproduce in I20040928-1200. This example:

	/**
	 * @throws FileNotFoundException
	 */
	void m() throws FileNotFoundException {
		throw new CharConversionException();
	}

... correctly adds
	 * @throws CharConversionException

Please reopen if you have steps to reproduce and indicate your build id.
Having:

@throws IOException blablablablabla

Adding method throwing BOTH IOException AND another exception results in:

@throws IOException
@throws "another exception"

Restting the "blablablalbla" description for IOException
I see. Here's an example to reproduce:

/**
 * @throws FileNotFoundException when the file was not found
 */
void m() throws FileNotFoundException {
	readIt();
}
private void readIt() throws CharConversionException, FileNotFoundException {
	if (true)
		throw new CharConversionException();
	else
		throw new FileNotFoundException();
}
