i have a (library) project Refactoring Tests Resources
and other projects org.eclipse....

before 205 they used to be sorted alphabetically
now they're not.
is that intentional?

before, project names were sorted non case sensitive.

we should be consistent with the Navigator. If the Navigator sorts in case 
insensitive way then we should do the same.
