Nothing happens if auto-build is on and (some) compiler options are
	changed .

	If something was reported as error and now I choose that to be
	reported as warning and if autobuild is on I expect a
	rebuild.

	Same if I switch from 1.2 to 1.3 compatibilty.


NOTES:
EG (01.10.2001 14:57:06)
	we should prompt the user for a rebuild whenever an option changes.

MA (01.10.2001 15:16:25)
	The description in the pages says everything.

EG (02.10.2001 18:16:59)
	yes, but this is isn't sufficient. We should show a dialog with the
	option to rebuild the workspace after apply.

Now a dialog pops up to ask if you want to do a full build now
