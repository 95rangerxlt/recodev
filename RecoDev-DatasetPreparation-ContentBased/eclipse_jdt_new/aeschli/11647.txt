When NewJavaProjectWizardPage.setDefaultClasspath is used with IPaths of source folders 
that have not yet been created, these entries do are shown. They should not be created before the 
user hits the finish button, because he may still change them.

Note also that the page would be 
easier to use if:
- Relative output folders were accepted (if output folder does not start with 
slash, it is assumed to be in the newly cerated project).
- Non-existing source folders in the 
classpath would (optionaly) be created by the page.

I'm sorry, I found out that I created the classpath-entry in the wrong way. Non-existing source 
folders are shown properly.



Non existing src folders are not shown in NewJavaProjectWizardPage
