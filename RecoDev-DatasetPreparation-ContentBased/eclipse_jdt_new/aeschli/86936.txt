Assigning the javadoc information to a jar (right click properties) stores the 
information in the metadata repository and not to the .classpath file. 

Hence this information is lost when moving the project to a different 
workspace. Secondly if this information was stored in the .classpath file it 
could be easier to transport around.

Thoughts ?

This part is owned by JDT (I think). JDT team, please return this back to us 
if I am mistaken.
Martin, this is in the works. Can you close it when we moved the location into
the classpath attributes.
Javadoc locations are now stored in the classpath attributes > 20040323

See bug 88859 for a request for a constant in jdt.core for the attribute name.
Filed bug 88864 against jdt.launching to update the JRE container to return
classpath entries with the javadoc attribute set.


Enhancement persist javadoc location info to the .classpath file [buildpath]
