When defining an ICompletionRequestor (org.eclipse.jdt.core) adapter, I could 
not get completion onto the @see tag in the leading javadoc comment (@see 
ICompletionRequestor).


[package org.eclipse.jdt.core;
/*

import org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.IProblem;

/**
 * Adapter of the requestor interface <code>ICompletionRequestor</code>.
 *
 * @see ICompletionRequestor
 * @since 2.0
 */
public class CompletionRequestorAdapter implements ICompletionRequestor {
}

Suspecting the heuristic for discarding all comment before is not working here, 
since it results in invalid code.

It should probably rather try to add a dummy class declaration before.

class Zork {

code completion in JavaDoc on types seems to be broken.
@see ICompletionRequestor#<code assist> works.
fixed > 20020328

inserting a fake 'import ' ahead of the type.
(adding a 'class Zork' is more complicated as 'Zork' would show up as a 
possible type + name conflicts)


No type completion in @see javadoc tag
