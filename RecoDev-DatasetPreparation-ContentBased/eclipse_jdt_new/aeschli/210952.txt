Build ID: I20070921-0919

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Setup eclipse with pessimistic file system provider.
2. Create two java projects with identical file names, but different file contents.
3. Check in one project
4. Copy one file from second project to the checked in one. You will be asked to overwrite. If you do this, file will be replaced and validateEdit will not be called. 

More information:
I think that validateEdit should be called somewhere in Refactoring.checkAllConditions(IProgressMonitor).

This bug causes readonly-flag-based team providers to not work properly. The flag can be even removed without notifying the team provider.
