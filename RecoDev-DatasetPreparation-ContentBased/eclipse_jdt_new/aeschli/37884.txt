corner case but...
1) Open Object
2) select toString in the editor
3) ctrl-t
4) type T to filter the list
->this takes minutes

The filtering is done after every keystroke. A first improvement is to do the 
refiltering after a time out. Another solution is to use the separate thread 
solution as is done in the ElementListSelectionDialog

Another idea is to not filter the dialog but to select and reveal the first 
match. this avoids that the tree is reconstructed after each key.

Now the filter is turned off when the hierarchy's root element has more than 40
children. (Does not apply to the outline information control)
just to clarify: the filter is turned off and the first match is selected?
yes, filter turned off, but first match is selected
