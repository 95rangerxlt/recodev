I should specify that I used the "export all preferences" button and not the 
individual export and import buttons on the preference pages for the templates.
Martin, can you please comment. 
Just wanted to note that this is still happening in M5->M6.  It's particularly 
annoying not being able to have templates transferred because it takes a while 
to re-input them.  This discourages people from trying out new builds.
