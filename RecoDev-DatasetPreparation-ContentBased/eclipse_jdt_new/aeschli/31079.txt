Build 20030205

1. Under problems tab, the severity drop down is much wider than on other pages 
(looks not as nice as others).

2. Under 'Style' tab, message 'Interface method not compatible...' should 
rather read: 'Interface method not compatible with Object protected method' 
(note the capitalized Object)

2. 'Static members accessed through non-static references' could be simplified 
into: 'Non-static access to static member'

I would also move the max number of problems per unit pref under the 'problems' 
tab (as nothing to do with Build path).
Make all sense and should be easy to fix.
fixed > 20030211

Just to be curious, what does 'with Object protected method' mean? 
protected method from 'Object'?
Yes, maybe the wording can thus be improved <g>
so what should it be? It currently is 'with Object protected method'.
What you suggested sounded fine to me:

Interface method not compatible with protected method from Object

(if you have enough room for it)

it is the longest label on the page so if we can make it shorter, the layout 
would profit. I'm not sure if I understood the functionality but what about

'Interface method conflicting with method from Object'
(Warn about...) 'Problematic interface method signatures'
It has to say 'protected' somewhere. We do already report incompatible methods, 
except for 'protected' ones which are bonus. e.g.:

interface I {
    int clone();   // not an issue unless you enable this problem kind
    int equals(Object o);  // would always be reported as an error
}
changed to
Conflict of interface method &with protected 'Object' method:
hope thats ok
