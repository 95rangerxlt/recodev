build I20021210

It is now cumbersome to create a java project with source files in a "src" 
folder.

1. Create a new Java project named P1.
2. On the Java settings page, hit Create New Folder... and call the 
folder "src"

Observe: There are now 2 entries on the source path, and an error saying
that they overlap.

Expectations:
(a) The default initial source folder (src files in project root) should
go away if I decide that I want a real source folder.
(b) The default is the wrong way. I think it would be better if the new
Java project wizard created and used a folder named "src" by default, and made
me say otherwise if I wanted either to use a folder with a different name or 
just dump sources in the project.

It's worse than that<g>.

Even if you select the project-level entry and Remove it, you still have an 
error and are unable to proceed.

If you then hit Back, followed by Next, the error disappears, but the Next and 
Finish buttons are still disabled.

Now, after adding the first source folder you get a dialog that asks if you 
want to remove the existing project folder. At the same time the output folder 
will be changed to 'bin'.

If you want the nesting scenario, the wizard will automatically add the correct 
exclusion pattern to the parent nesting folder to solve the conflict.
