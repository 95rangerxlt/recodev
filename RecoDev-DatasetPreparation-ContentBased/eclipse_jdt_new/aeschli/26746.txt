The compiler warns about an unnecessary import, while the organize imports does

This can be reproduced with these sources:
MyClass.java:
import MyInterface.MyInnerInterface;
public class MyClass implements MyInterface{
 	public MyInnerInterface myMethod() {
 		return null;
 	}
}
MyInterface.java:
public interface MyInterface {
	public interface MyInnerInterface {
	}
}
