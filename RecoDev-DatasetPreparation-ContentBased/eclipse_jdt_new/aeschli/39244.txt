The modifiersChanged() hook in NewTypeWizardPage is not being called when a
modifier radio-button is selected (public/default/private/protected), it is only
being called if a check box is selected (abstract/final/static).  I suspect a
missing "else if" clause in typePageDialogFieldChanged() in NewTypeWizardPage is
the culprit.  As such am unable to extend NewTypeWizardPage and validate
modifier settings (working on custom "class" wizard extension).

You're right, that's a bug. The way to work around the bug would be to override
createModifierControls, getModifiers and setModifiers to have your own widgets. 
The advantage would be that you can then leave certain options away.
