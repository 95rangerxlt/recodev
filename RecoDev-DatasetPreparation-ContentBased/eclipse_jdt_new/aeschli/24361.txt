Currently the "filecomment" template is placed first in the file before the 
package statement.

By convention the package statement is always first in the file, followed by 
the "filecomment".

Perhaps I'm wrong and the "filecomment" template really should go first, but if 
so, please create a new template called something like "copyrightcomment" that 
places a regular multi-line Java comment AFTER the package statement and BEFORE 
the import statements.

Another minor problem is that the default "filecomment" template is set to be a 
JavaDoc comment when it should really be a regular multi-line Java comment.  
The JavaDoc tool only picks up JavaDoc comments that appear before a class, 
field or method.

I didn't know there is a convention. Where did you find this? Nobody so far 
complained about this.

You're right that the file comment should not be a Javadoc comment. Fixed >

Well, there is no formal "convention" exactly, but if you want the JavaDoc tool 
to pick up your JavaDoc-comments then you had better place them where it 
expects them... this is where the "convention" comes from.  For more 
information on this, check the documentation for JavaDoc.
The filecomment is not a Javadoc comment, I fixed that, its just a normal 
comment now. To comment a type, use 'typecomment' it is always added directly 
before a type.
I'm almost sure that you can only have Javadoc comments for members. Please 
correct me if I'm wrong. 
The fix sounds good.  You are correct that the file comment cannot be a JavaDoc 
comment.  As far as I remember, the JavaDoc tool ONLY looks for JavaDoc-
comments that appear:

1.  Before a class.
2.  Before a field.
3.  Before a method.

In summary, the order of things tends to be:

package foo;

/*
 * file comment
 */

import bar.*;

/**
 * JavaDoc-comment for class
 */
public class Foo {
   /**
    * JavaDoc-comment for field
    */
   private String field;

   /**
    * JavaDoc-comment for constructor/method
    */
   public Foo() {
      super();
   }
}

But you should probably check the documentation for the latest version of the 
JavaDoc tool.

Note that the use of whitespace in the above example is to my own taste.
