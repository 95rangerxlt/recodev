The quick assist is only available while the caret is near the selection. Since
it affects the while if I'd expect to see it for any caret position in the line
where the condition is.

where the condition is.
Split && condition was designed to split on specified && operator, so you should
point exactly on needed && operator, you can not activate it just on line.
  For example, for condition:

if (a && b && c)

we can active quick assist on first or second &&...

May be I don't understand something... Can you give example?
"if (a && b && c)" is a valid case but it is not the 80% case (at least not if
probing my code ;-). My 80% case is: "if (a && b)". Hence I'd expect to get the
split && quick assist on the while line. If the formatting is
1: if
2: (a && b)
Then I'd expect it to get it at each position in line 2.

Aha.
  For such case, when surrounding statement is 'if' and condition has only one
&&, we really can activate quick assist without needing to specify exact &&,
i.e. in any point of 'if' statement. For other cases we will still require exact
pointing on &&.
  How this sounds for you?

I can implement this fairly easy.

BTW, I don't understand, why you use 'while' word. This quick assist is not
supposed to work with 'while'. Or... may be you have idea, how it can be
enhanced for 'while'?
Sounds good.
The while in the line "it affects..."  is superfluous.

I think Dani means "whole" instead of "while" in comments 0 and 2.
Ok, new of quick assists uploaded in
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74746, with fix for this request.
Now it is possible to activate 'split && condition' in any place of 'if'
statement, if there are only one top level && operator in 'if' condition.
closing, fixed by bug 74746


Split condition target to narrow
