I20030925

QuickAssist with linked mode has a default selection which is NOT the inserted
(and green underlined) proposal. This is annoying, since it prevents quick
acceptance with <Enter>.

class X {
	public void foo(int jott) {
	}
}

- cursor on 'jott', Ctrl+1
- choose 'Assign parameter to new field'
-> 'jott' is inserted in the editor, but 'i' is selected and inserted on <Enter>

It's most probably a typo in LinkedModeProposal, line 101:
"// keep first entry at first position
 Arrays.sort(res, 0, ..." should be
"Arrays.sort(res, 1, ..."
