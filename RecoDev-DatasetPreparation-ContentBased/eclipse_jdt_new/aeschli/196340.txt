Build ID: Eclipse 3.2

Steps To Reproduce:
Can OverrideMethodsAction.createRunnable make available 'save compilation unit' to users who want to save the file

Currently we see that

OverrideMethodsAction.createRunnable 
sets save=false in the AddUnimplementedMethodsOperation  constructor
There is no way to save the contents of the class after the operation runs, I
think this is a bug/unnecessary limitation, 

After the operation runs, it does not save the contents in the file so it
appears as if the operation did not work.

Right now I have 2 ways to get it to work
1. Use OverrideMethods...
Then I can get that code to work is to have the file open in
a editor, run the runnable/operation that dirties the file, and call
IWorkbenchPage.saveEditor(IEditorPart, false);
This solution is hacky.
2. Or use AddUnimplemented.... directly, that means I am using internal API

More information:
Also is there any chance/future plan that this functionality can be made available for use in a  headless/non UI  way . Right now using the Runnable is a way to use it headless but the class exists in jdt.ui plugin.  So I cannot run it headless without having UI dependency
fixed > 20070716

see bug 156170 for making this functionality available headless
