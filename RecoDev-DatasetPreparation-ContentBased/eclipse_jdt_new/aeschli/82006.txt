In response to Bug 38237 field images (IMG_FIELD_PUBLIC etc) were added to
ISharedImages. These images are publically available, however their
corresponding image descriptors return null.

For example, the following returns null:

JavaUI.getSharedImages().getImageDescriptor(ISharedImages.IMG_FIELD_PUBLIC);

The following returns an actual image:

JavaUI.getSharedImages().getImage(ISharedImages.IMG_FIELD_PUBLIC);

It seems to me that either getImageDescriptor() should return the image
descriptor for the field, or that the spec should be changed to indicate that
these fields are only available as images if that's the intended case.

The same is true for IMG_FIELD_PROTECTED, IMG_FIELD_PRIVATE, and 
IMG_FIELD_DEFAULT.
