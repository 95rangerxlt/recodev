The reason is that we have to disable autobuild. Platform/UI is listening to
this and add the build button. Martin is there a way that we disable build only
when the user switches to the second page. That would make the UI more stable in
99% of the cases.

Why is this necessary?

I seem to recall that there were bad side-effects of programmatically turning
autobuild on/off. 
John, can you comment?

In the wizard when you modify the classpath we work on the real resources. We
don't want that the build state is changed until you press ok.
the wizard has been changed to only do the off/on switch when entering/leaving
the second page
