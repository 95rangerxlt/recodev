Build: Freeze 1

In a self-hosting workspace, select the type IAdaptable in an editor and hit F4 
to populate the type hiearchy.  Since this interface has many sub-types, this 
takes several seconds to populate.  There should be a busy indicator while this 
is happening.

This is a problem if the type hierarchy is big. The workspace looks dead.

we should show a progress monitor, to do so reasonably needs a progress dialog 
that only appears after a timeout. Waiting for the corresponding support from 
the workbench. Without a timeout there will be a lot of unneeded dialog flicker 
since most of the time type hierarchy computation is fast.

Should investigate for F1, asking Nick for the status on the progress dialog 
with a timeout.
