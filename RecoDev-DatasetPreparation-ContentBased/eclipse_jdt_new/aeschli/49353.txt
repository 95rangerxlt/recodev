I upgarded from Sun Java 1.4.2_02 to 1.4.2_03. When I open the Javadoc
preference page, the entry fields shows "C:\Java\sun\1.4.2_02\bin\javadoc.exe",
which no longer exists but the error icon and message is NOT displayed at the
top of the pane.

If I edit the field but leave the entry still bogus, THEN the error icon and
message appear. I think the error should appear as soon as the pane is displayed.

Version 3.0.m6.
