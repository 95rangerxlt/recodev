3.2 M3 test pass

(not sure whether this is core or ui)

- set workspace source level to 1.4
- have a project 'Foo' with project specific source level of 5.0
- delete the project without deleting the underlying resource
- recreate it by creating a project with the same name

> expected: the source level is read from the project settings and set correctly
< actual: the project's settings are overwritten with default settings.
