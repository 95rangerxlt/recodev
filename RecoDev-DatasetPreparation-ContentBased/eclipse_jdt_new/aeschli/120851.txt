Extending on the NewTypeWizardPage and wanting to provide my own content for the type, I overrode 'constructCUContent(cu, typeContent, delimiter)' and passed in the typeContent which included the correct imports. Even though the correct imports were passed in, the ImportsManager doesnt add them finally to the document. How does one add imports to the provided content?

To customize the type body, you would override createTypeMembers. There you can add imports using the passed import manager.

constructCUContent would allow you to specify a different file template than the one in code templates. But you are right that there is a bug there if you really want to override that. I will fix it for M5.
