I would like to see the code generation templates handled the same way the
compiler preferences are.  In that there is a global setting and that you can
override it on a project by project basis.  Mainly because I use eclipse for
corporate and other development and I would like to include different
copyrights, etc. in files based on the project, instead of constantly cut and
pasting from one to another.
