Every time I create a new class by right-clicking on a package and choosing
New->Class, the "Generate comments" checkbox is not selected.  So, I have to
manually select it every time.  It would be nice if it retained the value from
the last use of the dialog.  (I seem to recall that this used to be the default
behavior, but in 3.1RC1 and 3.1RC2 this value does not seem to stick.)

David, 

we deceided to change the behavior to bring the check box more in sync with the
other code style preferences. The check box is now initialized from the code
style preference "Automatically add comments to new types and methods". The
check box on the wizard is only to temporarily override the setting.

With Eclipse 3.1 the code style settings can be configured per project.
Thanks a lot!  That solves the problem.

Martin and I discussed how we could improve this but still allow users to temporarily override the current properties:

- keep the checkbox behavior as it is
- move the 'Automatically add comments...' from 'Code Style' to 'Code Templates'
  page so that users see it when they click on the 'properties' link
- improve the text with the 'properties' link so that it is obvious where the
  default can be changed
fixed as suggested in comment 7
