Steps to reproduce:

1. Download log4j (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/download.html) and
include it as jar on the classpath in a project.

2. Create a line of code that instantiates a logger: 

    private static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(String.class);

3. Use orgainze imports (ctrl+shift+o) to create the required import.

4. Note the full list of imports and cancel.

5. Go to the Type Filters preference editor.

6. Add type filters for:

com.sun.enterprise.*
com.sun.jms.*
java.util.logging.*
org.apache.catalina.*
org.apache.jasper.*

and close the preference window.

7. Attempt to sort imports in the source.

8. The classes java.util.logging.Logger and org.apache.catalina.Logger still
show up in the import dialog.

Moving to JDT UI for comments.
Workaround is to use 'java.util.logging*' instead.
Fix is to make 'java.util.logging.*' and 'java.util.logging*' do the same.
