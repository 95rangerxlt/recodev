When i add a fileComment template in a new class files, the \n on windows is 
not put correctly in the sourde ... Eclipse put 0x0A but not the 0X0D in the 
file !

After that, if we look with another editor, all the fileComment is on the same 
line .. All others templates is ok !

Help me !
Can you please answer the following question to narrow down the problem
- did you mix Win2k with Linux?
- did you load the templates or preferences from a file?
- did you change the fileComment template
- is the java file generated on the same OS or has it been edited on a
non-Windows OS?
- do you still see the problem when using the default templates (press "Restore
Defaults")?

Win2k.
I load templates from file exported previously by eclipse.
Yes i change the template fileComment and typeComment (type comment is ok).
Only window !
Yes, with the template by default, i have the same problem !
Reassign due to staff changes.
