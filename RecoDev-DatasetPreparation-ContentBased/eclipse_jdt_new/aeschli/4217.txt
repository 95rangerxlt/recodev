The tab names of the Java Build Path properties show up this way on my machine:

	&Source  &Projects  &Libraries  &Order

	Also, the search dialog has the same problem.

	problem doesn't exist on Windows.
	DB will try to reproduce

	can be reproduced. Problem was introduced during the mnemonic pass.
	The problem is that SWT doesn't emulate the & processing in tab folders
	as is done in Windows. As a consequence they show up in the labels.

	Fix for 1.0 is to remove the & in the property files.
	Notice the translators should do the same, if they already have started
	the translations.

	Fixed in 1.0 for Search and Java Search in:
		plugin.properties of org.eclipse.search
		plugin.properties of org.eclipse.jdt.ui
