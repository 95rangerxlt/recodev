Select a complex package that contains class hierarchies and interface 
hierarchies (I selected org.eclipse.swt.events), and choose Open Type 
Hierarchy from the context menu.
The package is opened in the hierarchy view, and I see the nice class 
hierarchies (thank-you), but (as far as I can tell) the interface hierarchies 
are not shown.
Maybe there's an option somewhere to turn on interface display when showing 
the type hierarchies for a package, but I can't find it. It would be nice if 
it was optional (and if the option was easily accessible, like in the view 
toolbar), because maybe sometimes you don't want to see the interface 
hierarchies (because then some of your classes would show up in multiple 
places... under Object, and under the interface(s) that they implement <g>).
Note that in the package org.eclipse.swt.events, the classes that implement 
interfaces are not very interesting as subclasses of Object - they are only 
interesting as implementors of an interface. So in the case of this package, I 
would always view it with interface display turned on.
I realize that this may be a somewhat complex request, but surely it is doable?

Hierarchy opened on packages, source folders and projects now contains interfaces.
Wow - thanks! That was fast. Can't wait to see it!


Please add interfaces to package type hierarchy
