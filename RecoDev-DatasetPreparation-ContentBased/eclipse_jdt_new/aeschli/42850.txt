When using the many add...Listener constructs in Java, e.g.

a.addPropertyChangeListener(b);

the class of the argument sometimes does not implement the needed interface 
(here PropertyChangeListrener).

A new QuickFix could offer to add the appropriate interface to the class of 
the argument (in many cases provoking a new error that can be solved with 
another quickfix).
