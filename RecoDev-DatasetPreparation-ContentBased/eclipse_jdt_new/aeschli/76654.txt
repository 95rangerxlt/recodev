Javadoc generation requires destination directory to be present and
contain the files package-list and index.html.  However, this directory 
and files are not present because our Javadoc is a part of the project
build and is therefore under our output directory tree "local".
This property needs to have an "Allow output folders for Javadoc location"
option.

Javadoc generation is launched from UI => move to JDT/UI
The problem is that you can't set a Javadoc location that doesn't exist. 
Hoewever if you set it and delete it afterwards and repopulate it everything 
still seems to work as expected.

Martin, why do we force that the location exists ?
fixed > 20041027
You can now specify a folder (or JAR) that does not exist yet.
Note that missing 'package-list' and 'index.html' are no reason that the Javadoc
generation doesn't work. This is more about viewing the external Javadoc.
