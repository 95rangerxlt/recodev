from Philippe:

you have currently 3 options related to 1.4:

	 * COMPILER / Setting Source Compatibility Mode
	 *    Specify whether source is 1.3 or 1.4 compatible. From 1.4 
on, 'assert' is a keyword
	 *    reserved for assertion support.
	 *     - option id:			
	"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.source"
	 *     - possible values:	{ "1.3", "1.4" }
	 *     - default:				"1.3"

This option enables assertions in the language.

 
	 *  COMPILER / Defining Target Java Platform
	 *    For binary compatibility reason, .class files can be tagged to 
with certain VM versions and later.
	 *     - option id:			
	"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.codegen.targetPlatform"
	 *     - possible values:	{ "1.1", "1.2", "1.3", "1.4" }
	 *     - default:				"1.1"
This is the target VM setting, already surfaced.

	 * COMPILER / Setting Compliance Level
	 *    Select the compliance level for the compiler.
	 *     - option id:			
	"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.compliance"
	 *     - possible values:	{ "1.3", "1.4" }
	 *     - default:				"1.3"
This option toggles the compiler for 1.4 compliance (as defined by JCK), it 
isn't yet surfaced.


Though those settings can be toggled independantly from each other, in general 
they should be consistently set (one click switching):

in 1.3 global mode, then compliance should be 1.3, assertions disabled and 
target VM 1.1
in 1.4 global mode, then compliance should be 1.4, assertions enabled and 
target VM 1.2 (or 1.4 still unsure).
For the current time being, we do not support target 1.2 setting (we should no 
longer generate default abstract methods when target is 1.2).

So for now, the global 1.4 compliance mode should default the target to 1.1 (as 
defaults for 1.3 compliance mode).
Proposal is to add a single setting on the Errors and Warnings page:

Source JDK level: options 1.3, 1.4 
this options sets the other depending options internally.
The settings will be as suggested below:
in 1.3 global mode, then compliance should be 1.3, assertions disabled and 
target VM 1.1
in 1.4 global mode, then compliance should be 1.4, assertions enabled and 
target VM 1.2 (or 1.4 still unsure).
All target settings (1.1 to 1.4) are now supported.

In 1.3 compliance mode, target should default to 1.1 and source to 1.3 (source 
1.4 is forbidden).

In 1.4 compliance mode, and source is 1.4, then the target has to be 1.4. When 
source is 1.3, target should default to 1.2. 

These refinements are described in JavaCore.getDefaultOptions() javadoc comment.
if we reduce all (assert, source comp., target & compliance) to one single 
option (as EG suggested) the cleanest way would be if this is also done in 
JavaCore. 
Philippe?
No way, these correspond to 3 distinct options in the compiler (see javac 
command line options).

I think the UI should allow a global switch 1.3 to 1.4, but it should also 
allow to micromanage settings in case people know what they are doing.

So under the global setting 1.4, I feel there should be some secondary settings 
for choosing the source and target level...
