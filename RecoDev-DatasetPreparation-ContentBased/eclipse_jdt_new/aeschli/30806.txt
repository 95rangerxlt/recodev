1) Java Project>Properties>Java Build Path>Libraries Tab>Add Library

There are several problems with the wizard that shows up.
*   The title is New Library, it should be Add Library
*   The description refers to a new library
*   The page doesn't have a wizard icon (if we need a custom one pls add it to 
the icon request bug)
*   On the first page I'd like to switch to the next page by double clicking a 
container entry.

*   Selecting any Library and pressing next results in an empty title. The 
title doesn't come back when going back in the wizard.
