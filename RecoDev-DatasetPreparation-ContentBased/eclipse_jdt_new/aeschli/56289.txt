build I20040325-2030

In the Javadoc IDEWorkbenchAdvisor.declareWorkbenchImages, there is a link in
the Javadoc to a member type:
 (named in {@link IDE#SharedImages IDE.SharedImages})

- organize imports
- it prompts to disambiguate SharedImages (there's on in the o.e.ui.internal as
well as the member type of IDE)
- choose IDE.SharedImages
- it generates an import for the member type, but marks it as an unused import
(which I have set to report as errors)

Nick,
you can enable to check Javadoc and then the warning/error will go away.

Martin,
same problem has already been reported in bug 3654 which is marked as WONTFIX. I
actually don't like that Organize Import adds the imports, I would that it fully
qualifies my Javadoc. Could you add a preference (yes yet another preference :-(
for this?
Dani, organize import should only make changes in the imports. You have to add 
the qualification yourself.
I already had "Process Javadoc comments" checked in the Compiler > Javadoc
settings. The other items on that tab are set to Ignore.
fixed in 20040104

Nick, I think there's also a bug in your example. I tried it with the Javadoc
command: To link to an inner class you have to use dot's to qualify:
{@link IDE.SharedImages IDE.SharedImages}, '#' is used only for fields and methods.

Besides that, there really was a bug in organize import.
Thanks for the tip, I've fixed it up.
