There are handy-dandy quickfixs availble for making a block out of a one line
if, and a one line else.  But in each of those cases, I'd like the option to do
both in one action.  I NEVER want to have "block if" without a "block else", so
doing it one step would be nice thing.

Naturally, if I'm on an if statement without an else, there's no additional
choice needed.

Fair request.
In M2 there is a quick assist on 'if' that offers to add blocks for then and 
else.
