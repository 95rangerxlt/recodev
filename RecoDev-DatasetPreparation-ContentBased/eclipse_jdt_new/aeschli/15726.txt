public class A {
	int field; //field comment
	A(int fred){
		_fred= fred;
	}
}

you are offered to create field _fred
but then it steals the comment:

	int field;

	private int _fred; //field comment

the comment doesn't belong to the source range of the field, so quick fix would 
have to do similar dances as extract method.

Fix if trivial, otherwise we can ship with it. Martin pls consult with Dirk on 
this.
It's the MemberEdit. The same would happen in 'Add from local history'. 
I don't know who's the owner of MemberEdit. Maybe Dirk ? :-)
This is not trivial to fix since we always rely on position reported by AST or 
Java Core. 
Postpone > 2.0
Martin will you consider this in AST rewriting ?
will look into it
(have not yet looked at comments in the AST)
ASTRewriter can now specially handles single line comments following a 
statement.
