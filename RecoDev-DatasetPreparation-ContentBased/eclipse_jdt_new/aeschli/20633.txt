When you add an inner interface to a class or interface,
the "new interface" dialog offers a checkbox "static".

Wether an inner interface is static or not does not make a bit of a difference.
So the main effect that checkbox is likely to have is, it confuses Java-newcomers.
"Could you please tell me what this decision I have to make means?" (Nothing.)

Get rid of that checkbox.
