If you have "Show Statics" selected and "Show Fields" deselected, Static 
fields are shown. If the user turns off "Show Fields" we should not show 
fields.

The logic for filtering things from the view is:
- No fields should be shown if the "Show Fields" toggle is off.
- No statics should be shown if the "Show Statics" toggle is off.

Sorry for continuing this detail discussion, but the behaviour is correct.
Please read also bug 15505.

If we implement the behaviour that you propose, the button should be labeled:
'Do not hide fields' and 'Do not hide statics'

Note that only a pressed button has a meaning. An unpressed (unchecked) button 
should not have an influence on the view. 
So having 'Show statics' unpressed does not mean 'No Statics Shown'

Note that we had a clean behaviour before with the old checked state. 

Here is the proposal that we agreed on.

When the view shows up all local toolbar buttons are unpressed and all members 
are visible.

Pressing a local toolbar button activates a filter and reduces the members 
shown. To make this explicit we order new icons to indicate the filter status 
of these actions.

The tooltips will be:
- Hide Fields
- Hide Statics
- Show Only Public Members
