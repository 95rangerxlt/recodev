Build ID: M20080221-1800

Steps To Reproduce:
If the type of a variable declared in a loop is wrong, there should be a quick fix to change it to the right type, to be consistent with the behavior of Eclipse in other contexts.

For example:

ArrayList<String> myList = ...
for (Integer val : myList|) {

}

This should offer the choice to change val to type String etc.

See also bug 167472, it seems like there are no quick fixes implemented in the foreach context yet.

Thanks!
