Opening the dialog on arrow keys is really annoying since it disables scrolling 
around in the preview.

From a UI stand point I agree that dialogs should not open on key press. 
it's just a feature, I can remove it . It happend to me so many types that I 
tried to modify the read only text. It also happend to Erich in the standup 
meeting.

removed the feature
