Found in 3.1M3.

Set the preference Java->Code Style->Organize Imports->Number of imports needed
for .* to 2.  Then enter the following test code:

import static org.eclipse.swt.SWT.*;

public class Test
{
    int a = FILL, b = BOTTOM, c = TOP;
}

Do a Source->Organize Imports, and the static import gets expanded into 3
imports ignoring the preference setting.  Normal import statements still work
normally.

that's right. The threshold is currently only used for normal imports.
The rationale for introducing static imports to the language was to avoid
having explicit import statements for the objects defined in the imported file.
If we respect that rationale, the statement
    import static Foo.*;
should *never* be expanded into multiple imports.

Alternatively, we could provide a boolean option to expand static imports as
with normal imports.  By default, the option should be set to *not* expand
static imports.

Personally I don't care if the normal import preference is re-used or whether a
new preference is created, just that there is some way to change the current
behaviour.  I use Organize Imports often and automatically, as it both keeps the
list tidy and is great for resolving multiple symbol imports at once.  The
current behaviour makes me choose between using static imports and manually
fixing the import list all the time.

Kudos to the team for all the work on getting Eclipse and 1.5 working together.
It will be added, don't worry. A second threshold will be introduced, so you 
could specify to always have static imports on demand.



implemented in 20050126. We use the same threshold as for type imports


Organizing static imports doesn't respect preferences [code manipulation]
