in the editor, when there's no selection or the selection cannot be resolved - 
'show in packages view' finds the cu in the packages view.

when the selection resolves to sth - it shows the cu that declares the thing the
selection resolves to.

this is highly surprising - i do not pay any attention to the current selection 
when using this useful action.

these 2 things are really 2 different action - that's how i see it.

it is even worse now because code resolve works on empty selection as well

this action is totally unusable now 
(the only way to make it do what it is supposed to do is to go to the top of 
the file and select the type name)
Martin, can you comment on this?
for a long time, this was the intended behaviour:
 empty selection: CU itself
 selection: Core resolve of it

Same was for open in type hierarchy

With the request of changing code resolve to accept empty element, we are in 
troubles.
I want to have a way to open the current file in the package view
(even more that the code resolve).

Jean-Michael, can you please provide a test case for bug 13341. Have you 
activated Show in Packages View from the context menu or from the new Navigate 
menu.
From the context menu in the java editor. From the new Navigate menu it works 
and will even show the packages view if it wasn't currently in the active 
perspective.
The current show in packages view action works as follows:

- tries to use code resolve like all the other actions. If successful, the
  resolved element is opend.
- if no element could be resolved and the selection's length is 0 then the
  input element is taken.

Martin close this PR if you think that is the correct behaviour. Otherwise 
fix the action in the public API package.
i believe that this behavior is incorrect - it should show the *input* element
no resolving is expected

if i want to see the resolved element in the packages view (but how often does 
that happen, really) i hit f3 and the use this action.
changed to not do a code resolve. The sourounding element of the position is 
selected in the package view.
To open a resolved element, use F3 (Open selection)
