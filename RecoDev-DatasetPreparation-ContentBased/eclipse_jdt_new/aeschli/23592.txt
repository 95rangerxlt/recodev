I think highly of quick fix's generation of missing methods.

Today, I wanted to use it to create a missing method in the super class
of the class I was editing, so I tried

   super.complicatedMethodCall( ... many arguments ...);

but there was no quick fix available.

Spelling out the base class name

   ((MySuperClass)this).complicatedMethodCall( ... many arguments ...);

worked, so the functionality I desire is available.
