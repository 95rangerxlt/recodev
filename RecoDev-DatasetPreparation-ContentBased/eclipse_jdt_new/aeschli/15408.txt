package p;
class Test{
  void i(){
    int mm= m();
  }
  int m(){
   doSomethingImportantThatHasSideEffects();
   return 1;
  }
  private void doSomethingImportantThatHasSideEffects() {}
}

qf offers to remove mm - ok
but it should remove it without removing the call to m()

like:
void i(){
  m();
}

the correction to remove unused local has been removed. Its correct handling is 
not trivial (remove all write accesses), and other cases which I didn't think 
of. 

Will add later again.
