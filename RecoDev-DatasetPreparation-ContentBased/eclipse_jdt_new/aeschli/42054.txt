Build 20030826 (M3 candidate)

I was poking around at adding an external folder to the classpath when I got 
into trouble. My steps:

1. Open the project properties on a simple Java project containing only a Hello 
world program in the default package.
2. On the Java Build Path page, go to Libraries and click "Add class folder".
3. At this point, only the Java project should be visible. The OK button is 
disabled with no explanation. I had no idea why the button was disabled, so I 
started poking around.
4. Click "Create New Folder", Advanced, Link to folder in the file system.
5. Browse to a folder outside the workspace, provide a folder name, and click 
OK.
6. Back in the "Class Folder Selection" dialog now, select your new folder and 
click OK.
7. With a project named "Java" and a folder named "grah", an error message 
appears on the page: "Cannot nest 'Java/grah' inside 'Java'. To enable the 
nesting exclude 'grah/' from 'Java'. I don't understand what the page wants me 
to do at this point. The dialog wouldn't allow me to select "Java", but the page 
is telling me that I can't choose anything under Java. In fact, it seems to be 
implying that "Java" is a valid selection?
8. Click Cancel. The linked folder and the folders within it now appear in the 
Package Explorer.
9. Select the folders in the Package Explorer and press delete. For some folders 
(haven't pinned that down), an error dialog appears that just says something 
about "11" and says to check the log. The following is printed there:

Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 11

run(PerformChangeOperation.java:138)
	at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext.
runInCurrentThread(ModalContext.java:302)

Note that I see three problems here:
1. The lack of feedback in step 3.
2. The unclear error message in step 7.
3. The exception on delete.

We have to provide a fix for the exception for M3. I will generate one.
Fix for the exception got released to HEAD

Martin, can you please comment on the other issues.

It was a bug that you couldn't add the project ('Java') as class folder, fixed that.
Added the support to automatically fix the nesting problem that you had in (7).
