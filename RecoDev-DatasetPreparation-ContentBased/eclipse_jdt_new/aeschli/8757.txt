1) Focus on the hierarchy of class (one that has a few super classes).
2) Cause a compile error to happen in the class and save the change.
3) Select a different class in the hierarchy and then select the class with  
the error.  Note that now the label at the top of the methods list in the 
TypeHierarchy view nows has a red x on it.  I don't know why you have to flip 
between classes to make this red x appear - it should appear as soon as you 
save the change that caused a compile error.
4) Now fix the compile error and save the change.  The red x does not disappear 
from the label above the methods list.
