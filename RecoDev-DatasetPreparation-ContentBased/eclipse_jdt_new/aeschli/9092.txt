As of the latest stable build, Eclipse now supports removing prefix such as m_ 
from instance variables when creating getters/setters. That's great!

However, there's still room for improvement. For instance:
* Code assist suggests intelligent variable names without prefix. E.g:
MyQuickHandle qu<code assist> produces "quickHandle" as the first suggestion.
But when using a prefix, this does not work:
MyQuickHandle m_qu<code assist> produces no suggestions at all.

* Checking that all instance variables are consistently named. I'm thinking of 
something like "Organize imports", that automatically adds your favourite 
prefix (like m_ in my case) to all instance variables that doesn't have it 
already, and removes any other prefix (like _).

Along similar lines, and perhaps implied by the above comment, it would also be 
good to be able to remove a prefix like 'm_' from instance variable names. 
(Personally, I find they reduce code readability and are unnecessary when all 
the required info is at your fingertips in an IDE like Eclipse.)
