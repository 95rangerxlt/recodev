If you edit the custom output of source folder 'P/src', the dialg says that it 
it is relative to 'P/src'. It should really say that the custom output is 
relative to 'P'. And in fact when you enter 'bin' it creates it as 'P/bin' not 
as 'P/src/bin' as the dialog would suggest.

Custom output doesn't have to be relative to source folder but to project
