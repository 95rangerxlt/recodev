Build 20020418

If you define the following cu:
public class X {
  public void foo(String) {
  }
  public void foo(String, String) {
  }
}

and you choose to sort in the Outline, you get the following order:
X
+- foo(String, String)
+- foo(String)

I would expect to have:
X
+- foo(String)
+- foo(String, String)
