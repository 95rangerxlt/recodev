In my code I reference method 'foo()' which does not already exist. So I open the quick assist context menu (CTRL+1) on that reference and choose the 'create method' entry. There is a use case when this action produces a method stub with a wrong result type: When the method reference is followed by an array indexing:

    void f() {
        int i = nonExistingMethodReturningIntegerArray()[0];
    }

Here the new method should return an int _array_, but using quick assist results in the following method stub (some additional code parts due to template customization):

    /**
     * TODO: Description
     * @return
     */
    private int nonExistingMethodReturningIntegerArray() {
        // TODO: implementation
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not yet implemented");
    }

Of course, after this action, the method reference in the caller method 'f()' shows an error:

    "the type of the expression must be an array type but is resolved to int"
