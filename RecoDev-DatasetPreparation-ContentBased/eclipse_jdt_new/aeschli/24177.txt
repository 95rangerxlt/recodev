I had the type hierarchy browser open on a certain type, which I
"refactor/rename"-d.  Afterwards, the upper window of the browser, showing the
type hierarchy itself, had updated itself accordingly, while the lower half,
which shows the methods, showed the methods (including constructors) of the
old, unrenamed type.

I had triggered the renaming action out of the type's context menue in
the type hierarchy browser itself, in case that matters.
