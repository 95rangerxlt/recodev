One shows the build path page including a new JUnit entry, the other just shows the buildpath as is.
Oops, works indeed fine. I was confused because the 'configure' link opens the build path properties on the most recently opened tab ('Order and Export' in my case). I only saw the same number of entries but did not realize the different tab).

I would expect that both links activate the 'Libraries' tab. Adjusted summary.
Maybe I just offer one link 'Add'? 
Removing 'Add' it is also fine. It would avoid further questions, and would not block the user from removing the container and adding a project reference.

For plug-in projects, the user has to manually add the reference to the manifest anyway.

the message is now: 'JUnit 4 is not on the build path of project ''{0}''. <a href="a4">Click here</a> to add JUnit 4 to the build path and open the build path dialog.'
