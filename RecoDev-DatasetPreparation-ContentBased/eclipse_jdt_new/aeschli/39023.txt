When referencing a class field that doesn't exist, the quick fix to 'create
field in type...' creates an instance field, not a static field.

e.g.

Open quick fix on reference Foo.x when x doesn't exist creates

private [type] x;

rather than

private static [type] x;

There was a bug, but it showed only up inside methods of anonymous types or in
the case of
public class A {
  public foo() {
    a.x= 9;
  }
}

I got this bug showing up with the following:

public class Test {

	public Test() {
		int y = Test.x;
	}
}

Doing quick fix on Test.x resulted in: 

public class Test {

	private int x;

	public Test() {
		int y = Test.x;
	}
}

which is wrong.
I validated that your example is now fixed
OK, Thanks.
