1. Create a new Java project P1
On the Java Settings page hit the Browse next to Default output folder.

Observe: The dialog is empty, shows an error "No entries available", and
only allows Cancel.

Expectation: As with other dialogs, it would be better if I had an
opportunity to create folders at this time.

unable to create a linked output folder
for new projects, the project is not created at this time and therefore the 
creation of linked folders is not possible.
For M4, I disabled the 'Browse...' button for new projects.
You can still enter a new folder path in the text field (e.g. proj/bin) which 
will be created on 'OK', but you can not create linked folders.

I see the following possibilities:
- We accept that linked folders can;t be created in the New project wizard.
- We create the project when the 'next' button of the new project wizard is 
pressed and so allow to add linked folders. On 'cancel' the project will be 
removed again. This trick is already used for projects with external location 
for that we can use an existing '.classpath' file or guess a classpath.

The project is now created when entering the Java page, so the browse buttons 
are enabled and folder creation is possible
