This may not be good java coding, but it it still a bug...

When I use the "new class" wizard creating a class of the same name as the
class it extends, invalid code is generated (as shown below).  The code that is 
generated adds an import to the base class instead of using the fully 
quailified name.
 
 eclipse version : M5 (20020416)

package com.neil.buesing;

import com.neil.X;

/**
 * @version 	1.0
 * @author
 */
public class X extends X {

}
