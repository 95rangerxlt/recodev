hi,

 if you have unit tests which are inner classes, then some JUnit View actions are missing or not working.

Specifically,

 (1) if the inner class unit test is wrapped as a suite, then the 'run suite' option in the context menu on the suite element does not appear
 (2) in the same situation as above, if you right-click on an individual test an re-run it, you get an error dialog saying "Test type does not exist"

thanks,
Andrew
ps. the reason I'm using inner classes is that I need a core set of tests run twice in different setup scenarios. The tests depend on accessing configuration information, and so test decorators are not a suitable mechanism.

example project

attached bare-bones example of this in action. To reproduce the problem

(1) Launch MySuite unit test suite
(2) Right-click on "com.acme.test.UnitTestWithInner$Inner1" - note there is no "Run" or "Debug" action
(3) Right-click on "testNumberOne", and Run/Debug - get an error dialog
What build are you using? This works for me in I20070323-1616

- 'Run as JUnit test' and 'Run as Junit Plug-in Test' are both available on the suite an the test element. When run, 8 tests are executed
- On the method I only see 'Run as JUnit test'. This is bug 179460.

I'm also using Version: 3.3.0 Build id: I20070323-1616

I can still reproduce the behaviour described in comment #1 though - to be clear running all 8 unit tests the first time works - that is launching the suite works.

Its when you want to either re-run an individual test (method), or test (class) that error dialogs are produced. The failing actions are invoked from the context-menu on elements in the JUnit view.

I can successfully launch an inner-class test (class) from the editor though

thanks,
Andrew

thanks, I tried against I20070502-0010, and verified individual tests (methods) work :)

I'm not seeing Run/Debug menu items appear in the context menu when right clicking on a suite (see Comment #1, step (2))?

Please file new bug, thanks!
