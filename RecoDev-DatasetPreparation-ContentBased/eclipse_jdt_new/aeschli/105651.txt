Hi all,
A nice to have would be 'quick fix' to automatiically generate a getter when a 
field is, currently unused.

public class MyClass {
   private int field;  // unused field
}

click on lightbulb, select "Generate getter" would result in

public class MyClass {
   private int field;  // warning gone
   public int getField() {
     return field;
   }
}

-----
*Thanks* all for the great work. Eclipse gets better and better. I have to use 
an old version (WSAD) at work and boy do I notice the difference!
