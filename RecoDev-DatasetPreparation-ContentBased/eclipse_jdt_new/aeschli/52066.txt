the dialog that appears when you add a sourcepath to a newly created java workspace says 
Click OK to blahblahblah. and the options are Yes and No.. which are the more mac version of the 
windows ok/cancel i suppose. can we change the wording to "Do you want to blahblah?" so the dialog 
buttons make sense?
