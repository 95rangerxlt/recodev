E.g. check the following code snippet:

1    private boolean checkIfInTemp(String value1, String value2) {
2        boolean found = false;
3        String sql = "SELECT value1 FROM " + TEMP_TABLE + 
4                     " WHERE value1=? AND value2=?";
5        searchInTemp = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
6        searchInTemp.setString(1, value1);
7        searchInTemp.setString(2, value2);
8        ResultSet rs = searchInTemp.executeQuery();
9        if (rs.next()) {
10           found = true;
11       }//if found
12       rs.close();
13       return false;
14    }

if I select lines 5-12 and invoke quick fix (Ctrl-1) there will be an option 
called Surround with 'try' (try catch block) which works just fine meaning it 
suroounds the selected line in one try/catch block catching the SQLException 
what may occur in these lines.
The problem arises when I select only 6-12 (or the declaration of the prepared 
statement is in another method - which is the case in many situation with 
prepared statements). In this case quick fix offers only Surround with try/catch 
which surrounds only the FIRST line of the selected text...
I suppose surround with try/catch quick fix should always wrap the whole 
selection into a try/catch block.

Martin, can you please have a look. Surround With refactoring normally honors 
the selection. 
fixed in M4


Surround with try catch quick fix works in a non-consistent way [quick fix]
