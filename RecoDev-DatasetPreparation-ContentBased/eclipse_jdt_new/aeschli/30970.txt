Build I20030205

I opened type hierarchy of FindAction (type hierarchy mode) and clicked on the
types (opened them in the editor).

See attached picture.

Note: It might be a Platform UI problem with the rendering of icons/decorators.

The TH with the fat icon
fixed for M5
What was it?
bug in the hierarchy label provider in combination with new element comparer. 
With the element comparer it is now possible that a viewer gets a refresh for a 
working copy element even the viewer does not contain working copies (like the 
type hierarchy view). The hierarchy label provider was not prepared to get 
working copies.

dirk, we have to investigate on that. 

fixed. The type hierarchy has now a own element comparer
