I'm using JavaCapabilityConfigurationPage to configure a project for my 
plugin.  Basically, I inserted an extra page between the "Create a Java 
Project" page and "Java settings" page.  Now the browse button on the Default 
output folder in the "Java Setting" page is always disabled.  It is disabled 
because of the following 2 lines in BuildPathsBlock.init(...):

projectExists= (project.exists() && project.getFile(".classpath").exists()); 
// projectExists is false becuase ".classpath" does not exist yet
...
fBuildPathDialogField.enableButton(projectExists);

I can understand the check for (project.exists()), but why the check 
for ".classpath"?

Incidentally, the "Default output setting" browse button for the current New 
Java Project is enabled.  But I think this is the side effect of a separate 
bug. The button is enabled by the WizardDialogs restoreUIState(). which also 
enabled the "Remove" button.  (Click on the Remove button and it becomes 
disabled)

This bug existed in version 2.1.x as well.

Martin, can you please comment.
you're right, 'project.getFile(".classpath").exists())' is too much.
I'll fix this.

For the problem with 'restoreUIState': Can you file your findings in a bug 
against platform UI?
Martin, thank you!  

I've created a separate bug on the "Remove" button issue - bug 70171.
