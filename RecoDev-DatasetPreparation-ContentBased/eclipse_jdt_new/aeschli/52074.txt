I have Eclipse set up to clear all blank lines (which I think is the default Eclipse setting anyway) but 
when doing an Organise Import, the importer leaves a blank line between the top-level package name 
imports, e.g.

import java.io.Something
import java.util.SomethingElse

import javax.ejb.Other

import com.example.Another

It would be useful if the Organise Imports didn't put a line in, if the code formatter preferences is to 
ignore all blank lines anyway.

Move to JDT/UI.

notice - some of us like the organize import style of grouping.
The point is that the two systems (OI and format) must agree with each other
Any idea on what conditions the organise import puts in a blank line, anyway? 
Is it just on the top-level package name, or does it do it for lower level ones?

Why not separate 'org.apache' imports from 'org.w3c' as well? The possibilities 
could be endless ...

But in any case, I think that being consistent between formatting and organise 
imports is a Good Thing. I'm also pretty sure that it works on other operating 
systems than Mac OS X so if you can test it on another system we can promote 
this to a platform unspecific bug.
the separations depends on the entered groups on the organize imports 
preference page
