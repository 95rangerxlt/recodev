It's even worse.

The errors are also added when I do it manually on one file open
JavaSourceLookupDialog and press Ctrl+Shift+O.

It also happens when I replace 0 with 1. I guess the rule to replace with '*' is
stronger than the conflict handling. In cases where there are conflicts the '*'
should not be applied.

Martin, can you comment on this.
