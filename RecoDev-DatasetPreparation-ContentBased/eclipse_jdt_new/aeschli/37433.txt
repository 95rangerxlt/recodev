A translator had the following problem:

File name:
\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user\doc_zip\reference\
ref-preferences-code-generation.htm
.
Naming conventions are used by the Generate Getter and Setter action and by all 
actions and 'Quick Fix' proposals that create fields, parameters and fields.

=> I think this sentence should be changed to as below:
".....that create fields, parameters and local variables" .
