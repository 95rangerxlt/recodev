	creating a source folder should be doable in 2 simple steps - now it takes many more, and it's difficult to figure it out.
	1. create an empty project
	2. add some packages and classes to it
	
	now, you want to create a source folder - you should be able to just rightclick on a project 
	and choose 'New->Source Folder'
	
	now, you have to open the project properties, go to the build path and do 5 or so more things to accomplish this task.
	there's an issuse about what to do with the already existsing packages: i'd say - by default, move them 
	to the newly created source folder

creating source folders is simple. What you are asking is makeing the 
conversion of a project layout from project=src to one with source folders 
simple. This is a rare operation. Defer
judging by the frequency of this question on the newsgroup (asked _very_ ofter -
 more than once a week) i think it is a frequent operation

alternatively, there should be another intuitive way to tell eclipse that these 
subfolders of my project contain source (currect solution is not intuitive - 
like i said, looking on the newsgroup user confusion)
agreed, users are reporting problems on this.
One idea was to add a button that computes the source build path for a project 
automatically based on searching for .java files.

Needs more investigation before going ahead.
More (wizard) help on this would be nice since this was/is a top problem from
the newsgroup.

The new source folder wizard has been improved. When invoke on a project witnh 
the project as source folder, it offers to replace this entry with the new 
source folder, change the output location (and remove the old class files).
Reorganizing the source have to be done by the user.
