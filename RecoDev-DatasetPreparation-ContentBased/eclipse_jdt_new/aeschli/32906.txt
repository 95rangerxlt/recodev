case 1:
- select 'show type hierarchy' in the hierarchy view
- in an editor press F4 on a class name
-> 'show type hierarchy' is ok

-> 'show subtype hierarchy' is ok

case 2:
- select 'show supertype hierarchy'
- in an editor press F4 on a class name
-> 'show supertype hierarchy' is ok
-> 'show type hierarchy' is only expanded down to the focused type, this is
inconsistent with case 1
-> 'show subtype hierarchy' is collapsed

case 3:

-> 'show subtype hierarchy' is only expanded to level 1 (which is consistent but
 impractical)
-> 'show supertype hierarchy' is collapsed
-> 'show type hierarchy' is only expanded down to the focused type, this is
inconsistent with case 1

IMO the super type hierarchy should always be fully expanded and the sup type 
hierarchy should be expanded one level below the focus type.
