package p;
class Test{
	int i(){
		int i= 0, jjj= 1;
		return i;
	}
}

jjj is not used to qf offers to remove it.
i say 'fine'
but it leaves me in a state with compiler errors:
class Test{
	int i(){
		return i;
	}
}

the correction to remove unused local has been removed. Its correct handling is 
not trivial (remove all write accesses), and other cases which I didn't think 
of. 

Will add later again.
