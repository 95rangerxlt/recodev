I've tried to find some good descriptions to present to the end user for the
five alignment options, and I came up with the following:

COMPACT_SPLIT:             Wrap only when necessary
COMPACT_FIRST_BREAK_SPLIT: Always wrap first element, others when necessary
ONE_PER_LINE_SPLIT:        Wrap always
NEXT_SHIFTED_SPLIT:        Wrap always, indent all but the first element
NEXT_PER_LINE_SPLIT:       Wrap always, except first element only if necessary

Are these semantically correct? Requesting for comments.

Olivier please comment.
I don't think we should have "Wrap always" in the alignment description. This is
misleading with the force settings. If force is unchecked, it wraps only if the
line exceeds the page width value.
I am proposing the following description:

All these modes are optional. Wrapping is only done if the line exceeds the 
page width:

COMPACT_SPLIT: Wrap using as few lines as possible

COMPACT_FIRST_BREAK_SPLIT: Wrap first element on a new line and wrap next 
elements using as few lines as possible.

ONE_PER_LINE_SPLIT: If wrapping, put each element on its own line.

NEXT_SHIFTED_SPLIT: Same than above, but indent all elements by one except the 
first element.

NEXT_PER_LINE_SPLIT: If wrapping, put each element on its own line except 
first element.

FORCE: Force wrapping.

Better solutions is welcome. The "Wrap always" is too confusing.
Move to JDT/UI.
Please change the description of the different option. A good idea might be to
have a tooltip to explain each wrapping. Right now the "Wrap always" is
definitely too confusing.
I made some suggestions that can help to find the proper description.
This bug almost got lost, sorry
Tried some improvements, released > 20040305
