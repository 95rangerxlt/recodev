In the package explorer view, I select all of the files I want to perform 
Organize Imports on, over 500 java files.  I perform the Organize Import and 
everything appears to succeed.  I then perform a build and I get build errors.  
I look at the files and code is missing.

This is the original:

package com.penske.apps.rentalnet.business;
import com.penske.ui.util.*;

public class CPBChoice implements IPUTChoice
{
...
}

The result:

package com.penske.apps.rentalnet.business;
import com.penske.ui.util.IPUTChoice;c class CPBChoice implements IPUTChoice
{
...
}

I can't rproduce this but fixed another similar bug where imports got truncated 
(bug 21275).
Please reopen the bug if you see this again.


Mass Organize Imports is deleting code
