When running tests I found bug 226319: After each tests the display contains lots of async execs not yet processed, as the tests run in the display loop and do not let run the display loop.

When looking at the runnables queued, it turns out that lots of them are from the ProblemMarkerManager and from the PackageExplorerContentProvider sending listener notifications and label updates.

These classes could bundle their requests, and only send an async exec when the previous one isn't still in the queue.
