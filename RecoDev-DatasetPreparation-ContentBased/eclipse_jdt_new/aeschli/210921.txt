Build ID: 3.3.1.1

Steps To Reproduce:
I have written a custom Runner which can be used by @Runwith()
In the runner I attach a runlistener. 
In that runlistener the 'testRunFinished' method is not called during a junit run form eclipse.

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		 JUnitCore core= new JUnitCore(); 
		 core.run(TestSuite.class);
	}
When you do it in this way at the end the 'testRunFinished' is called, but running junit tests from Eclipse it is not called. 

I think this event is fired against the initial list of listeners, but I add this listener during the run, so it is not part of the initial listeners.

I will attach some test files
