Steps to reproduce:
- Open build path properties
- Choose Add Variable
- Choose Configure Variables
- Add a new one pointing to an inexisting JAR file
- Info status appears saying:
Variable points to a folder: To choose an archive inside the folder, click 'extend'

-> Message should rather say that the file does not exist
-> The sentence '..., click 'extend'' should rather say '..., click 'Extend...''
