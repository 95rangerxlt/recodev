In a Java Browser, when I am in the Types pane, I would like to use the 
standard (at least on Windows) CTRL-A to perform a "Select All" instead of 
using the mouse. I can then perform ops on all the types (like moving them).

Thank you considering this request.

This is a general issue. If we support Ctrl+A we should support it in the whole 
workbench where multi selections are allowed.

Moving to platform UI for commenting. 
It is not clear that Select All makes sense in other views, like the Navigator 
and Packages view, which show elements of different types.

For cases like the Types view, this is clearer, and I recommend adding a 
handler for Select All.

Agree.
Will add it to Types and Packages view (i.e. those that show a list).
Also makes sense in the Search view.

Please file separate PRs for additional views you'd like to see it since they
belong to different components.

Implemented feature for Packages, Types and Search view.
Available in 2.1 builds > 20020820

Moving to [type hierarchy] because its members view is the only table view which
does not offer Ctrl+A.
