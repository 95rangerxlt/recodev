We had a discussion about how to best support SWT application developement. The
biggest problem is the native dll and that user have to create special launch
configs with -Djava.library.path=.... to get a SWT application up and running.

However the dll problems seems to be a more general problem. Although the
compiler doesn't care about dll it would fit into our current story to have a
class path entry kind "natives". Java/Core wouldn't benefit from the entry, but
debugger could use it to construct the -Djava.library.path= command line argument.

Just released classpath attributes support. See JDT Core build notes.
Moving to JDT UI to use this support.
Martin, we should discuss the UI to enter class path attributes.

Darin, if we can agree on an attribute key the lanuch config can use this info
to add shared libraries to the command line.
The attribute should be defined in org.eclipse.jdt.launching plug-in (core 
plug-in that JDT UI depends upon). This allows the launcher to have access to 
the attribute key.
We have provided support in org.eclipse.jdt.launching for native classpath 
entry attributes.

@see JavaRuntime.CLASSPATH_ATTR_LIBRARY_PATH_ENTRY
Martin, can we plan the UI for this for M7.
AS discussed we provide UI for this for M7.
added UI > 20050503

The released UI does not offer variables yet. I don't know how deep I want to go
into the variable resolving business. Maybe it would be best to let jdt.debug
contribute the configuration dialog instead of the implementation in jdt.ui. We
need to discuss what we want for 3.1.
