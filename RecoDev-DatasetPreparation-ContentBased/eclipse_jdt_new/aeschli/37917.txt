Build R2.1

Open workspace compiler compliance preferences.
By default, these point at 1.3 compliance level, with default compliance 
settings.

Now, switch to 1.4. Observe that default settings are updated (ok).
Uncheck the default checkbox, and switch general compliance back to 1.3.

Observe that it complains about source level issue (ok).

Recheck the use default settings, which will change source level to 1.3 
default, and observe that the complaint about source level is still shown !?!
