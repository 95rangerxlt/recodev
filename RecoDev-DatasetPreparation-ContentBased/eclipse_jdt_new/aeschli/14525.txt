When using the Interface Selection dialog, the user should be given some sort of
visual confirmation that the interfaces they select have actually been added
after hitting the Add button.  Perhaps placing a check mark next to interfaces

previously added interfaces.  The latter sugegstion opens up the possibility of
removing interfaces from the list of currently selected ones.

happened as a result of clicking the Add button?
