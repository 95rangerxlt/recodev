Method stubs are inserted before overriden method declarations. This shouldn't 
be the case.

e.g.
class X {
  void someMethod() {}
}

class Y extends X {
  some<CODEASSIST> --> first proposal shouldn't be #some()
}

For CompletionEngine
 - overriden method relevance is 18
 - method stub relevance is 5

The proposals list seems do not use the relevance for method stubs.

Move to JDT/UI
add added some relevance because type proposals go a higher relevance than the 
method stub proposal. 
fixed > 20040517

now using the jdt.core relevance



Relevance for method stub is too high
