I'm using M4.  I have a source file which imports java.awt.* and java.util.*. 
Now, I need a method parameter of type java.util.List.  I type 'List', highlight
it, and press Ctrl+Shift+m; the Add Import dialog appears asking me to choose
between java.awt.List and java.util.List.  I select the proper one and OK, but
my imports do not get updated.  Seems like it realizes the java.util.* import
should cover me, but it doesn't take into consideration the ambiguous aspect.
