this one is frustrating

i have my pref set to have 'f' prefix for fields (no other prefix/suffix is set)

public class B {
	int fBoom;
	
	void f(){
		foo(fBoom);//compile error here
	}
}
use quick fix - it creates:

private void foo(int fBoom) {//wrong param name!
}

which means i have to go and fix it manually all the time

The 'change method signature, add parameter' should , in this case where the
argument is a field, not take the name of the argument but create a new name.
