For a .java file that has fields which are volatile or transient, there is no 
visual indication in the Outline view of these keywords.  Here is the EC

Hi,

The Eclipse java editor is great but I miss something useful that VAJ had:
different icons overlays for field modifiers.

More specifically: volatile and transient fields have special icons, to help
identify them (a little 'T' and a little 'V').

We are reaching the limit of number of information we can present on a single 
icon.

*** Bug 56073 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Reopening for reconsideration.

Volatile is mutually exclusive with final, so it could go top-right.
Transient is only for fields, which cannot have any of the lower-right adornments, so it can go lower-right.

See JavaElementImageDecorator.
Martin, could you request artwork for the overlays ("V" and "T")?

I mean JavaElementImageProvider and JavaElementImageDescriptor. Need to do this for M6, since the latter is an API class.
