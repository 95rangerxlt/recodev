Bug report 45206 describes errors when importing from the default package when 
running 1.4 compliant compiles. Unfortunately, if you use Organize Imports and 
a needed class exists in the default package, it will be used. This creates an 
import generated by the system which is unusable and invalid.

Even if the class exists in both default and non-default packages, the one in 
the default package is used.

Note that if you use quick fix, the class in the default package is not shown 
as a valid choice.

A workaround is to manually delete the import and use quick fix to insert the 
correct one, but this is a pain.

Move to JDT/UI.
The UI should not propose the class from the default package as a valid import
in this case.
