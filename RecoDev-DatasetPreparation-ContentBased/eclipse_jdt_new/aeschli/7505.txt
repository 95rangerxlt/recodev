When I created a class using the Java Class wizard, (specifically extending the 
jface.Action class), the import for the super class was not automatically added 
to the new source file.
I noticed in the 2002-01-15 build that it does add the import statement, but it 
appears inside the copyright comment.  If I use the class wizard to create class 
B that extends class A in another package, it generates exactly the following 
(note the placement of the import statement):

/*

import org.foo.bar.A;
 * (c) Copyright 2001 MyCorporation.
 * All Rights Reserved.
 */
package org.goo.moo;

/**
 * @version 	1.0
 * @author
 */
public class B extends A {

}
The comment problem is fixed in the 20020122 build.
The super class was imported in previous builds, need to investigate.
is fixed in 20122
