It would be nice for Eclipse to be able to organize imports automatically, maybe
for every file saving, or alternatively when it compiles and detects that some
class names are not known.
Ideally, this would have to be configurable, of course ;).

the reason why we hesitate to do this is that 'organize imports' uses 
heuristics to evaluate the imports. It's possible (altough not very common) 
that you end up with a import conflict.
Note that organize import usually is invoked on incomplete source (import 
missing).

There has been the discussion to add a second version of 'organize import' that 
runs on compilable source. Having that, we could offer something on save.
support for fixing imports on compile errors will be investigated for 2.0.


You can now call organize imports on multiple CU / packages.
Quick fix also offers to add imports.

There are no plans for correction on save for 2.0.
