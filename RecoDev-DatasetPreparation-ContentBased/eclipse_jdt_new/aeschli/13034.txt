If you try and create a Source Folder in a Java Project you have just created 
you get an error preventing you from hitting finish.

STEPS
1) Create Java Project Foo
2) Open New->Source Folder
3) Enter Bar as the name - you will get "Cannot nest entry Bar inside entry 
Foo/Bar"
4) Create a folder Bar.
5) Add it as a source folder in the Properties Dialog for Foo. No problem.

The problem shows up when adding a source folder to a project that was created 
with the project as a source folder. To create a source folder the user has to:
1) press Edit Class path
2) change the source page to user source folders
3) change the output folder to another folder than the project.

We have to be more supportive. When the New Source folder action discovers that 
the project doesn't use source folder. It should help the user to migrate.

Improved source folder wizard.
Invoked on a project, the wizard will allow a new source folder but warn that 
this replaces the existing project source folder. The output location is also 
changed automatically, if the user agrees (old class files removed).
