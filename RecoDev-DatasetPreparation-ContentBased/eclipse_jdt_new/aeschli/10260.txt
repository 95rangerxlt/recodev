When nothing can be displayed in the hierarchy, it shows the message "Select a 
type (for example, in the outliner), and use its..."

Elsewhere in Eclipse, this is called the "Outline view".  A minor nit.

Snapshot of message w/outliner
FWIW, my preferred wording would be:

"A type is not available.

Select a type (for example, from the Outline view) and use its 'Open Type 
Hierarchy' menu choice to display it here."

This is consistent with the Outline view in the same state, and somewhat less 
wordy.
agreed with the suggested rewording

Another "outliner" sighting
Maybe you should scan the source/properties files for all cases of "outliner"?  
Here's another one I happened upon (see attached image).

I know, it's a nit...
