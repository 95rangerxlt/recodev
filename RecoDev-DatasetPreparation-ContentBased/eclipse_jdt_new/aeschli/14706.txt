Workbench->Preferences->Java.
Description for the page is
"Appearance of Java elements in viewers."
This isn't a sentence, so it shouldn't end with a period. Instead, it's more 
of a title.

Likewise, most of the other Java preferences pages have this problem. It seems 
nit-picky but it actually caused me to read it three times, as I figured I was 
mis-parsing a sentence, until I figured out it wasn't a sentence.

Fixed that. Replaced the dot by a colon.
