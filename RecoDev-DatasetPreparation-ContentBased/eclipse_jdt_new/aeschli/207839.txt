Using I20071023-0800, link with editor doesn't work for compilation units that are not on the build path.

1) Create an empty workspace
2) Create a java project "P" with a source folder "src"
3) Create a folder "tests" in the root of "P".
4) Create a new type "X" in the source folder "src".
An editor on X is opened. Leave it open.
5) Create a new file called "Test.java" inside "tests".
6) Open it.
7) Click on link with editor
8) Click on the editor for the class X and the editor for the file Test.java
9) When X is selected, X.java is properly highlighted inside the package explorer
10) When Test.java is selected, the project name is selected inside the package explorer.
Expected result is the file Test.java should be selected and the tree expanded to show it.
