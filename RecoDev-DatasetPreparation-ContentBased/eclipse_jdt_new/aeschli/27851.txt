It would be nice to be able to say somewhere in the preferences that any 
methods that are generated for example when you select Source-
>Override/Implement Methods that instead of those functions returning null you 
want them to throw UnsupportedOperationException. Alternatively it could create 
tasks for filling in those functions.

Martin, any comments on such an enhancement?

More possible configuration of generated code is on the plan, but not sure that 
we will be able to do it for 2.1
fixed > 20030129

You can now specify a new method/constructor template and place comments or 
todotags where you want.
Preferences>Java>Code Generation>Code Templates
Having Downloaded I20030129,
and looking at the Code Templates section in the preferences I only see a 
template called catchblock and I cannot add any of my own (there is no add 
button). Only import. If the functionality specified by the bug report is 
availble how would it be done. The documentation doesn't have anything about 
the code templates yet. 

in a build _greater_ than I20030129
-> intergration build of next week or nightly build of I20030130 (but I 
wouldn't recommend you to download a nightly build)

you will see an entry 'methodbody' and 'constructorbody'


generate exceptions in source creation
