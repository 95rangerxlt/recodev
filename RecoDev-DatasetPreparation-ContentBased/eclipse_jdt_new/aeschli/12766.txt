I don't know if this really is a bug because this way of importing old projects 
probably is not the cleanest way.

Try this:
1. File -> New -> Project... -> Java Project
2. Uncheck "Use default" and chose a directory with an existing project.
Press "next".
3. Check "Use source folders contained in the project"
4. Click "Add existing folders".
5. The (existing) directory structure is not visible. (So we will have to set 
the source directory later)

After the import is complete, everything works as expected.

I am using the nightly build 20020402

This is the expected behaviour given that the project is only created after 
pressing finish. When switching to the configuration based project wizards then 
we can address this.
Works with the new capability wizard (released in 20020404)


"New Java Project..." with alternative project directory does not see folders
