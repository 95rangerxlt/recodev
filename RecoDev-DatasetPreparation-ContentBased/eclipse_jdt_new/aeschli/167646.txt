Problem is in ProblemTreeViewer.handleInvalidSelection with the workaround for 125708: setSelection is called AND super.handleInvalidSelection().

handleInvalidSelection sends out selection changes without testing if the elements are in the tree.


As bug 125708 is fixed I removed the whole workaround
