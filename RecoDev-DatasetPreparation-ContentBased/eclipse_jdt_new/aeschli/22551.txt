(R2.0)

I can almost use Eclipse like a Smalltalk Class Hierarchy browser. This is one 
of two problems.

My custom perspective has a Packages pane, a Hierarchy pane (which includes 
methods of course) and a code editor pane. I cannot create a new class that is 
a subclass of the selected class in the Hierarchy pane. Note that I can do this 
in the "Types" pane from the context menu.

The workaround is to use the Packages context menu, but this does NOT pick up 
the superclass that I have selected in the Hierarchy pane.
