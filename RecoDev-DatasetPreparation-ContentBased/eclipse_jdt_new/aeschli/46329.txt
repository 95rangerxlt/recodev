This is also a problem with changes to the AST rewriter. Martin, please 
investiagte and fix for next integrstion.

I will attach a file containing the thrown exceptions.

*** Bug 46328 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
fixed for 20031111
The method now correctly throws a CoreException, the tests pass (as they swallow
the core exception)
The tests seem to pass a wrong document to the rewriter. My guess is that the
document is not corresponding to the AST.
OK, I debugged it. The core exception is swallowed by the AST rewriter. See 
ASTNodes.annotateNode. Furthermore the length of the buffer is ok. The 
compilation unit node managed by the ast rewriter is 23. The text buffer 
passed to the rewriter has the same length.

May be we should disable the test for the build.
