Creating a new class with the class wizard creates 3 entries in the local history.
The oldest is empty, the others have the same content.

NOTES:
EG (5/23/2001 11:35:43 AM)
	is the wizard setting the contents 3 times?

MA (5/25/01 10:10:32 AM)
	JDOM automatically saves the content
	2 times add import: I have to save, otherwise create hierarchy does not succeed.

EG (5/30/01 9:43:51 AM)
	JDOM should provide control over the saving behaviour and not do it automatically.
	Moving to JCORE for comment.

*** Bug 3315 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Right now, UI is doing a mix of JDOM maninpulation on compilation units and 
explicit commit on working copies.

It should just create a working copy, manipulate this working copy (JDOM 
manipulations won't save the changes to disk until a commit is done), and then 
commit it.

To optimize java element change events, JavaCore.run(IWorkspaceRunnable, 
IProgressMonitor) should be used.

Moving to JDT-UI.

I tried that but had to stop as type hierarchies were not build on such a 
working copy
(it is a working copy without underlying file)
Martin, what's the bug number for the problem you're having on building a type 
hierarchy on a working copy? We're not aware of any problem in this area.
there is no bug report yet. 
Fixed but can't relase due to the mentioned hierarchy problem.
Jerome, can you have a look at it? My fix for the NewTypeWizardPage is attached 
here.
Replace the existing code from HEAD or 20021009 with this one.
- Set a breakpoint in createInheritedMethods at
   ITypeHierarchy hierarchy= type.newSupertypeHierarchy(monitor);
- Create a new class in the wizard, add e.g. 'MouseListener' as interface, 
check 'inherited abstract methods'
- The type passed in createInheritedMethods is from a woking copy which is 
complete (type + superinterfaces + import)
The original CU only contains a package statement. I suspect that this causes 
the problem
