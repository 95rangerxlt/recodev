3.3 Build id: I20070220-1330

The AdaptExpression returns NOT_LOADED (which evaluates to TRUE), in some circumstances when the adapter factory and adapter class are actually loaded.

This happens when an object "has" an adapter, but the "adapter factory" returns "null" for the adapter. In this case, the adapt expression assumes the adapter is not loaded. However, if one queries the adapter manager to see if the adapter is loaded, LOADED may be returned.

patch

proposed patch checks whether the adapter is loaded to determine if FALSE should be returned instead of NOT_LOADED.
This can be seen when using the "Run As >" action in the context menu. For example, select a .project file or .classpath file, and you will see that "JUnit" appears as a way to launch the file (when it should not). This is because the IJavaElement adapter is registered for the IEditorInput type, but when queried for an adapter, it returns null for files that don't have an associated IJavaElement (ok, when IJavaElement is not loaded). This should not happen when JDT is actually loaded.

The enablement expression for the JUnit launch shortcut looks like this:

<enablement>
  <with variable="selection">
     <count value="1"/>
       <iterate>
          <adapt type="org.eclipse.jdt.core.IJavaElement">
	      <test property="org.eclipse.jdt.core.isInJavaProject"/>
	      <test property="org.eclipse.jdt.core.hasTypeOnClasspath" value="junit.framework.Test"/>
	      <test property="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.canLaunchAsJUnit" forcePluginActivation="true"/>
	 </adapt>
       </iterate>
   </with>
</enablement>
Context launching (bug 74480) works better when this patch is applied, as it reduces the number of launching choices for novice users.
Moving to JUI
Dirk, ok to release?
+1.

Fix makes use of the API I requested a long time ago ;-).
Martin, are you going to release the code ?
