The constructor of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.wizards.
MethodStubsSelectionButtonGroup contains this line:

    if (fButtonsStyle == SWT.RADIO) {

Since fButtonsStyle is not initialized from the parameter buttonsStyle at that 
moment, what actually was meant is this:

    if (buttonsStyle == SWT.RADIO) {

BTW: I found this bug using the FindBugs plugin. Seems to be really useful.
