Access restrictions can be set for libraries and JAR archives on the project
properties page.

In the global preferences, user libraries have an entry that seems to suggest
that the access restrictions can be set globally for a user library.

The installed JRE however, does not have such a global default.

1. The configurabiltiy should be consistent: either only configurable via
project page, or both via project page and global preferences.

2. I suggest the latter, as setting access restrictions globally makes sense.
Imagine a library with API and implementation packages. You would want to set
the restrictions once and for all.

Martin, can you please comment.

My understanding was always, that we only have import rules, but no export
rules. So we can't set access restrictions globally as long as there isn't a
singleton for a library.
I don't know what global setting you mean. On the 'user libarries' page you can
assign the type rules only to the library child entries (JAR's).

To be conistent with the JRE container it's better if we do not allow to set
access rules on the container's JAR's

Approved for M6.
removed the access rules nodes for elements in containers: On the build path
page and on the user libraries pref page.

Oops, there's still a bug:

- create a new user libray with a jar
-> the jar has no 'Access rules' subnode -> OK

- close preferences and then go to User Libraries prefs page again
-> 'Access rules' subnode shows up, but doesn't react to doubleclick nor 'Edit...'
-> It shouldn't show up.
