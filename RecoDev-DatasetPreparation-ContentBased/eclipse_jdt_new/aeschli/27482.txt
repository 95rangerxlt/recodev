However, I don't understand why the VM decides to load this class. It seems 
when a class is instantiated, its code is analysed and all references to 
classes are resolved (byte code validation?)

This was our code
class JavaUIHelpListener {
  String fContextId;


  public JavaUIHelpListener(String id) {
    fContextId= id;
  }

  public helpPerformed(HelpEvent e) {
    IContext context= new JavadocHelpContext(fContextId);
    ....
  }
}

JavadocHelpContext extends IContext, and this fact made the VM (Sun 1.4) loads 
IContext (and the help plugin), even helpPerformed has not been invoked and 
only the JavaUIHelpListener constructor is invoked.

If I create a static method in JavadocHelpContext that does all that 
helpPerformed does, no loading of IContext happens at the time of the 
constructor invocation.
