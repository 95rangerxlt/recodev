Eclipse SDK
Version: 3.2.0
Build id: M20060629-1905


Consider the following snippet:

---
public class Machine {

	private State state;

	public boolean isAlive() {
		return state != State.DEAD;
	}

	private enum State {
		IDLE, RUNNING, DEAD
	}

}
---

Run Source -> Add Import on "State.DEAD". Two compiler errors appear:
- DEAD cannot be resolved.
- The import Machine cannot be resolved.
