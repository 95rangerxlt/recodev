Build 20020312

The logic of the validation is wrong.

It should ensure that:

1.3 compliance
    source cannot be 1.4
    target cannot be 1.4

1.4 compliance
  if source 1.3, target can be anywhere from 1.1 to 1.4
  if source 1.4, target must be 1.4

if source is 1.3, then only should be usable the 'report assert as identifier' 
error (note that this one should simply be on the errors or warnings pane).

I want to keep the 'assert' field on the compliance page, validation that spans 
over two pages is not very user friendly.
