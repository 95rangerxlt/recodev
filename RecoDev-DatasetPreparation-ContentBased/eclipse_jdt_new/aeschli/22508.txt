1.It would be very useful if when you went to a java project -> properties it not only 
remembered that you were in Java Build Path but also that you were, for example in the 
"Libraries" page. Frequently, I have to go to a project and add a variable and switch 
pages to do so.

2. In the "Add Variable" option of the above listed page (Properties->Java Build Path->
Libraries) the variable list window is considerably to small for easy use and worse cannot 
be resized.

3. When going to "Extend..." of the above option, it would be convient to be able to simply 
double click an item/folder to expand it or select it rather than have to specifically select 
the tree expand box. Also, is there any reason this now uses a tree instead of the normal 
file browser as it was in Eclipse 1.0. (The tree is uneccesarily cluttered with non 
compatible files like .txt, instead of just .jar and .zip files).

Thanks!
