[I'm not too sure about the component...]

When a number of lines are copied and pasted in at a new point, it often 
happens that a variable of the pasted source has a different name at the new 
location. And quite often it isn't one or two instances of the variable that 
must then be renamed, but a hole series of them.

In these case a quickfix is missing to rename all of these variable en masse, 
e.g. a version of the existing "Rename Local" (which for some reason does not 
exist in this case).

Move to JDT/UI.
yes, a popular request. Local rename curretly only works for variables that can
be resolved by the compiler.

Wanted QuickFix: rename local variable (when variable cannot be resolved)
