Build 2.1-M3

We recently fixed a bug in the compiler (bug 26841) where we did not report 
certain visibility issues in imports. This is now fixed, and finds a problem in 
JDT/UI code, against InlineConstantRefactoring,

The following import does not resolve properly anymore since 
InlineTargetCompilationUnit is not visible.

import 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.code.InlineConstantRefactoring.Inlin
eTargetCompilationUnit.ClassQualification.ClassQualificationCannotBePerformed;

Note that javac reports it as well.

That import must have been added by some sort of tool, since I did not add it 
myself, and I doubt that anyone else manually added that import.
Fix released
