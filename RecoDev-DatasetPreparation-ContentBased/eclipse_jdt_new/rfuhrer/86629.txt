Bob,

JDT/Core has fixed bug 84724. However enabling the corresponding test case in
the IntroduceFactoryTests fails. Can you please have a look.

This is the same as bug 85465 (regarding determining the # of actual arguments 
in a varargs method call site). For me, this was fixed by applying the 
associated patch:

  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85465

Presumably you haven't released that patch into HEAD yet. Let me know if you 
don't see the same result after applying the patch.
Is fixed.
