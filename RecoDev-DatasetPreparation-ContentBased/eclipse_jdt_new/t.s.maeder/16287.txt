Hi,

I guess a "search in selected project" option in the search dialog would be a 
good feature.  It could also be added to the "References", "Declarations" 
and "Implementators" popup menu.
Searching in the project that the selection (or editor input) is contained in 
is a commen usage pattern. It would be useful to have. 

Workaround is to define a corresponding working set. More convenient would be 
an additional radio button in the search page: "Search in project". This would 
also be consistent with the filtering support in the task list ("on any 
resource in same project"). 

Since there is a workaround this is only time permitting for 2.0 and at this 
point in time this means likely out.

I note that this bug has 15 votes, several duplicates and has been around for 
more than a year.  It would likely be trivial to implement and a real bonus for 
users.  

In my very big workspace I had time to enter this comment while searching for a 
method in the whole workspace.  It is not feasible for me to setup/maintain 
working sets for each project or even group of projects.

Having a menu entry for "Project" would improve the user's experience.
It's on the 3.0 plan.


Search in project is in.
I'm trying it in I200311192030 and it's not working completely for me. For 
example I open any file in a project (may or may not be a Java file), double-
click on a word in the file (i.e, the current selection is in the text of the 
source document), and press Control-H to bring up the Search dialog. I can 
see "Enclosing Projects" in the scope group but it's grayed out and cannot be 
selected in Java Search, File Search, Plug-in Search, and NLS Keys. The option 
does not appear in the Java/JSP Search tab (I think that one is contributed by 
the javafamily example I have installed). I can send you a screen shot if you 
can't duplicate this.

Interestingly, if my selection is in the Package Explorer view (i.e, I single 
click on a source file in the Exlorer and immediately bring up the Search 
dialog without clicking in the text of the source file), then the Enclosing 
Projects option is NOT grayed out.

I assume the correct thing to do in this case is to reopen the request so 
that's what I'll do.

For the graying out, please see bug 41252.
Replace in project support is optional (depends on the search page implementor),
and the JSP/Java page does not implement it (no plans either).
