We changed that behaviour some time because many people felt that using the
editor's project as the "current" project was the right thing to do. This works
as intented.
I read this a little fast. the problem is that the title is wrong, the scope is
actually ok.
We were always calculating the scope description based on the selected elements.
Fixed.


References in Project: Title shows wrong project
