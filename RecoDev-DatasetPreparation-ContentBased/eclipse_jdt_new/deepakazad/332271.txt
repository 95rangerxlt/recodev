I found three, which do not use this icon
- Add paranoiac parenthesis for conditions
- Put 'instanceof' in parentheses
- Put 'instanceof' in parentheses

Is there a reason for not doing this ?

(Note: JavaPluginImages.IMG_CORRECTION_CAST is not a great name for this icon but I have not changed this for now)
