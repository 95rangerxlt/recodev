When creating a new Template, the contexts in the Context drop-down are not sorted. If you have your own template context, finding the right context is much more difficult because the contexts are not in any sorted order.e

A simple example is Preferences > Templates and then view the Templates for Java Script. When you click New, the New Template Context dropdown lists: jsdoc, javaScript. As you can see, the list isn't sorted.

For our implementation of templates, we have roughly 12 available contexts. Because they appear in a "random" order in the Context dropdown, the users task of finding the right template is much more difficult. For example, the Context dropdown for our templates shows: informix_udf_sql, db2luw_udf_sql, db2zos_sp_sql, db2_i5_java, db2luw_udf_plsql, oracle_udf_plsql ...

If the Context list was sorted, they would be grouped in some logical order (all db2luw* would be together, all db2zos*, etc.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Preferences > JavaScript > Editor > Templates (or any Templates that has multiple context)
2. New..., the New Template dialog appears.
3. In the Context box, you will see the available context jsdoc, javaScript. These are not sorted. For us, it much worse because we have many contexts and they appear in random order.

For me it appears that the table is sorted on 'name', is this the same for you?
I'm referring to the Context dropdown on the New Template dialog. From the Templates page, click New... The New Template dialog will appear. The Context: dropdown will have a list of all known contexts -- and this list is not sorted. For example, in my case, it has the following contexts in the order I show below:
   informix_udf_sql
   db2luw_udf_sql
   db2zos_sp_sql
   db2i5_sp_java
   db2luw_udf_plsql
   ...

This is the Context: list that should be sorted, rather than what appears to be a random order.
For the Java>Editor>Template case I observe that the list in the combo is sorted in reverse, but this may be coincidence.  

Moving this bug to JDT UI.

Yes, this is a coincidence, as there is no sorting ;-)

While we can sort the contexts in JDT UI (in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.preferences.EditTemplateDialog) this will not solve the original problem, as this is an internal dialog specific to JDT UI. 

You will need to file a bug for the DB development plugins (DTP?) you are using about which I have no clue.
The template page is registered through the <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages"> and the actual class extends TemplatePreferencePage. So it's all standard Eclipse code -- nothing special or hidden. The contexts you see are the contexts we register -- so its not part of Eclipse DTP.

It's all standard code through your available APIs. Just need the list sorted.

fix

Sorting done in both places - org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.templates.TemplatePreferencePage.EditTemplateDialog and org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.preferences.EditTemplateDialog.

Dani, I tried to commit the fix but forgot that I do not have commit rights on Text, hence the commit for TemplatePreferencePage.EditTemplateDialog failed but succeeded for the JDT dialog :) Please release the attached patch.

We should use ICU here, i.e. create a field with
com.ibm.icu.text.Collator.getInstance() in the comparator and call compare(..) on that.

If case insensitivity is required, you can call setStrength(SECONDARY) on the collator (but I think it's OK without).
Deepak, please update the patch.

updated patch
Patch is good except the 'f' prefix for the local variable name.

Committed Platform Text part to HEAD with fix for variable name.

Deepak, please fix the JDT part and commit to HEAD as well.
>Patch is good except the 'f' prefix for the local variable name.
Sorry, 'f' is good since it's a field after.
JDT part released to HEAD.
