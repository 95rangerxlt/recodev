Currently the rulers adds a couple of listeners to the content window; that should be avoided.

Avoid to add listener from rulers highlighter to content window

Changing reviewer 'cause Patrick will be on PTO for a while.

Mike, can you have a look at that? If you don't feel comfortable to review this, just let me know! Thanks!

Comparing to the previous patch, I just added the try / catch block I mentioned on vidyo. My mistake was that I was using a `finally` initially instead of a `catch`; without realizing that it was a nested `try` statement – therefore the enclosing try statement's catch clause was entered.

Where this patch will indeed solve the issue when we leave the tests – at least locally, I'm running on try too – we should probably understand what is happening with the highlighter environment, and why is destroyed before the highlighter.

There is an exception, but it doesn't seems related to this bug.
What about if in CustomHighlighterActor.prototype.finalize you reverse the environment and highlighter destroys?

  finalize: method(function() {
    if (this._highlighter) {
      this._highlighter.destroy();
      this._highlighter = null;
    }

    if (this._highlighterEnv) {
      this._highlighterEnv.destroy();
      this._highlighterEnv = null;
    }
  }, {
    oneway: true
  })

Tried this quickly locally, and the exception seems to be gone.

This is definitely the culprit then; I was looking at `HighlighterActor`, where the order is correct (the highlighter is destroyed before the environment).

Should we remove the try / catch then, and invert the order in `CustomHighlighterActor`?

Yes, that's the right thing to do.

I thought I've already updated this patch, but apparently I didn't.

Here also the try result:
