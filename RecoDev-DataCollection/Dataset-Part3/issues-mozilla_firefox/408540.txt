Instead of opening http://www.radioparadise.com, we get this in Firefox URL box:
file:///N:/Music/Radio%20Paradise%20-%20eclectic%20online%20rock%20radio.url
But in XP (w/Firefox 2.0.0.11), website is opened as expected.
The internet shortcut we clicked was created in MSEI (by the way, how to do that in Firefox?  Right-click from website doesn't appear to offer "Save Shortcut"!)
Here is contents of .url:
[InternetShortcut]
URL=http://www.radioparadise.com/
IDList=
IconFile=http://www.radioparadise.com/favicon.ico
IconIndex=1
[{000214A0-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
Prop3=19,2


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to favorite website, e.g., www.radioparadise.com, in MSIE
2.Right-click in non-sensitive page area
3.Select and click "Create Shortcut" -- creats .url on desktop
4.Navigate or minimize windows to view desktop
5.Double-click the new shortcut icon on desktop (Firefox IS your default browser, right?
6.Repeat in both XP and Vista (Home Premium here).

Actual Results:  
Firefox has lame string in URL box:
file:///N:/Music/Radio%20Paradise%20-%20eclectic%20online%20rock%20radio.url
... and page view is half-rendered

Expected Results:  
Should open same web page as was viewing when "Create Shortcut" clicked.

We have a .jpg showing everything in one view.  May we attach or e-mail it?

Creating a shortcut from Seamonkey (drag&Drop the small icon [favicon] in front of the URL in the URL Bar to the desktop) and also opening such a link from IE created with the same method in IE works as expected for me but this bug could be Firefox only.

We did apply the ddeexec edit in the Windows Registry (4 places) before reporting this bug.
Per comment #2, we tried from Firefox (Minefield) drag-and-drop icon before URL box to Vista desktop, then closed browser and double-clicked the desktop icon; got the same (broken, non-functional) view.  Very repeatable here.

Pete: I tried to reproduce your issue using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008010405 Minefield/3.0b3pre. I tried both dragging the radioparadise icon in Firefox to the desktop and launching (worked), as well as creating a shortcut in IE with IE as my default browser (also worked, but I switched Firefox to my default browser on launch).
I, too, am experiencing this issue. The desktop shortcut attempts to open a file such as "file:///C:/Users/jholland/Desktop/Woot%20One%20Day,%20One%20Deal%20(SM).URL" rather than opening up "http://www.woot.com". If I change my default browser to IE (how painful!), it works fine. I have made the registry edit for ddeexec, but this made no difference. How frustrating- we rely on desktop shortcuts heavily! Any ideas?
This is still a problem with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5. The same build on XP has no issues.

*This bug only affect shortcuts that are double-clicked, however.* If you drag the .url file onto the Fx window the page loads with the correct http address.
Tom, could you try this with a trunk nightly? Thanks
