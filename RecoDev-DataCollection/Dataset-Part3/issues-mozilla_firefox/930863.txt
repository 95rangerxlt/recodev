function pageShowEventHandlers(persisted) {...} is called for a pageShow event.  This calls charsetLoadListener() which has:

  var charset = window.content.document.characterSet;

however, window.content.document is likely to be null at this point, causing browser_bug462673.js to fail.

hrmph - it doesn't actually cause the test to fail, but still highlights an issue to be addressed.
yoink!
test fails on yesterday's fx-team
test failure appears to be unrelated, bill thinks something is wrong in the order of load/unload events in the test wrt to window.close(). Filing a new bug on that
