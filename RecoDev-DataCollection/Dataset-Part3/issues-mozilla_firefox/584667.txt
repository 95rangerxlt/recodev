Markus - do you plan on landing your patch?  We need it in by the end of the day Friday.  If you can't get it landed yourself, please add checkin-needed while keeping in mind the points raised in http://blog.bonardo.net/2010/06/22/so-youre-about-to-use-checkin-needed
Oh, I almost forgot about this. I'll land it now.

I'll let somebody else check this in together with his patches so that I don't waste Tinderbox bandwidth.
