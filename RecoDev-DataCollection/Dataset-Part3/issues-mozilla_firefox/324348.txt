There was a recent regression that Firefox's window opens briefly at a size probably somewhere around 150x150 (hard to tell, it's a very quick flash at that size) before resizing to its expected (persisted) size.  In my window manager (metacity) this has significant effects on where the window is positioned, since the initial position is set based on the small size and the resize doesn't change that position, so it often ends up positioned with the right edge way offscreen.

This regressed between Linux nightlies 2006-01-18-05-trunk and 2006-01-20-16-trunk.  There weren't nightlies in the interim because prometheus was orange.

Hrm.  I was expecting this to turn out to be a regression from bug 297541, but it appears not to be.
This is a regression from Ben's tab browser landing (bug 308396) at 2006-01-20 15:04.
As far as I can tell, the initial width is exactly 200px. Externally launched windows and new windows exhibit the issue; links opened in new windows don't.

An interesting point is that the view-source window (in tbird as well) started doing the same incorrect initial size thing earlier; the regression range for view-source is 2005-12-15-15Z/2005-12-20-23Z.
backing out

fixes the initial size of both the firefox browser and view-source windows.
We should back that out. Ginn's away and I'm away too but I would approve someone else doing it.

patch1: only focus if already visible

Without understanding too much, I find it plausible that viewsource, and browser with the bug 308396 changes, focus stuff so early that with the change from bug 295447 it causes gtk_widget_show via gtk_window_present before the window is quite ready for it. Based on that, possible solutions would be
a) don't tweak focus that early from tabbrowser/viewsource
b) delay the gtk_window_present until later if it is necessary in these cases
c) don't gtk_window_present if the window is not yet visible

patch implements (c), I don't have a seamonkey build so I don't know if it regresses bug 295447 -- I don't really know what IsVisible or GTK_VISIBLE mean exactly.
I can't give you review on this for a few days

I am not doing reviews right now.  You will need to find someone else.
not much more I can do here before the 5th ->ginn

It does regress Bug 295447.

Tested on both Firefox and Seamonkey.
It doesn't regress Bug 295447.
