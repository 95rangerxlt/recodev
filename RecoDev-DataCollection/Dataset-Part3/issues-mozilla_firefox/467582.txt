https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Updating_extensions_for_Firefox_3.1 has good info on areas to check or make changes to for compatibility with fx 3.1
I've been running 3.1b1 with Forecastfox installed for a couple of weeks, and I haven't run into any issues with it.

Jon, Aaron, and I have discussed putting up a new build sometime this week with 3.1 support.
updated to b3 so forecastfox is tracking with the latest
Current Forecastfox seems to support 3.0 through the 4.0 betas; resolving.
