The UX branch has had a bunch of Australis-related landings on it, and we don't show test results for them.

Jamun gets UX merged in periodically, and we *do* have test results there - and the results aren't great. Lots of orange.

We need to fix those tests if this all has a hope of landing on mozilla-central. This is a metabug to track that work.

Bumping to M6 - we didn't get all tests passing during M5, but we're close! We'll likely get closer (if not all the way) in M6.
Removing the items from M7 that do not block landing on m-c.
This blocks landing.
I'm going to call this. There's one test that failed as a one-off a week ago which can remain open for a bit to see if it'd reoccur, but it seems to have gone quiet again. Otherwise all the deps are FIXED/WFM. So I think this is landable as far as tests are concerned, and hence this can be closed.
