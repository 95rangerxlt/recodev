I was testing the "New Window" item added by bug 415463 and noticed that Firefox did not come to the foreground when the menu item was selected while Firefox was not the active application.  The attached patches fix this behavior.

The application delegate in toolkit/xre/MacApplicationDelegate.mm already activates the application when the user was selected the dock menu item for a window.  For custom items, however, we should allow the application to choose whether it should be activated.  (For example, you can choose "Get New Mail" from the Mail.app dock menu without activating Mail.app.)

I considered adding support to XUL for a custom attribute specifying whether to activate or not because rejected this idea as I'd rather not modify XUL for a Mac-only feature.  The best place seems to be nsIMacDockSupport as this feature is in support of dock menu commands.

This needs obj-c exception guards, you can fix that on checkin.

Add Obj-C exception guards.

Does the interface change needs superreview?

Josh: I don't have committer access so I'll just flag it for check-in unless you can get to it (assuming it doesn't need superreview).
