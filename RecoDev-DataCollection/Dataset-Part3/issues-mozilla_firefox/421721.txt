I believe I've already said that it didn't add any new anonymous content. If you had actually looked at the patch from that bug, you'd notice that it simply did a wholesale replacement of one binding's content with another's in order to get rid of unnecessary extra files. There's no relation at all between 395402 and the "new" contents of the binding.
Yeah, don't worry, I looked at the patch. :)
tabs-bottom-spacer was moved from theme-specific bindings (where it made sense long ago) to the cross-platform tabbrowser.xml. This bug blocking bug 395402 is a useful reference for others in order to understand this bug's history.
I've sent a message to m.d.themes.
