I did a "Find Updates" and got the attached compatibility warning.  On AMO, CoolIris is 3.5.* compatible.  None of my other 3.5.* add-ons trigger the warning.

Not sure what is happening but when I change the maxVersion to 4.0 and start it up, with the extension as the only thing in the profile, it crashes.

But that is not related to this bug report I think.
This is when your crash started: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=08897e5342b4&tochange=940db0db0dca
I believe the issue is that cooliris has a max version of 3.5b4pre in install.rdf and they have overridden this max version in AMO to 3.5.*.  Apparently the updater isn't checking AMO.  This will be an issue as many extensions are 3.5.* compatible in AMO but not in their install.rdf.
Please check for repro.  Issue appears to be resolved.
