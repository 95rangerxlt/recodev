In the latest Windows nightlies, the default icon for firefox.exe shown in
Windows Explorer is the document icon, rather than the actual icon used in the
program window as should be expected.

The first icon resource in firefox.exe should be the program icon; the document
icon could then be stored as icon resource 2, and specified in the appropriate
icon registry key as "...firefox.exe,1".

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to the directory where the latest Firefox nightly is installed.
2. Look at the icon for firefox.exe.

Actual Results:  
The icon shown looks like a document.

Expected Results:  
The icon should be the program icon (with the globe).

Note this affects trunk builds using the CVS artwork.
I fixed this in my tree by changing the following line in
mozilla/xpfe/appshell/public/nsINativeAppSupportWin.idl from:

#define IDI_DOCUMENT 1

to:

#define IDI_DOCUMENT 50000

I dunno what the correct way to fix it is though :-)

I noticed this bug with new CVS artwork. Let's hope this graphic bug will be
killed before 0.9 is out ;o)
I don't know if it is related to this bug, but I noticed something strange.

I installed a 98Se in a VMWare box, and copied a brand new CVS based trunk
firefox build with this patch in (CVS up-to-date at midnight mozilla.org time on
this thursday).

I installed ("un7ziping") my version on it, and said it to be my default browser.

When I go into /firefox/res/ and looked at bloatcycle.html, I saw it was using
IE icon instead of firefox one.

I'm seeing the same thing under my WinXP, having the old official firefox 0.8
icon (I installed and used a long time 0.8) instead of "blueglobe" one.

Sorry for the spam if it is not related to this bug.
