If one has a url in history that is someword2.blah.com, it will show up in the
autocomplete bar when "someword" is typed. This is correct. However when
"someword." is typed, the url should disappear from the autocomplete as it can't
possibly be "someword2" if one has already typed "someword."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a url in the location bar like "www23.brinkster.com"
2. Go to a different site e.g. google.com
3. Give the location bar focus and type "www."
4. Observe that autocomplete is still visible with "www23.brinkster.com"

Actual Results:  
Autocomplete bar is still there with URL that should not match.

Expected Results:  
The autocomplete bar should disappear as soon as the first char not matching is
typed, in this case it would be "."

Clarification: hit ENTER after entering the URL in step 1.
Not a SeaMonkey issue...
Confirming with 2003-11-24 build on WinXP.
There is a little more to this bug.  If you have "http://www.google.com/" 
and "http://www23.brinkster.com" in the history:
1. type "www." => get list of www1.*, www2.* (original bug)
2. add "g" to get "www.g" => get nothing

This bug is the result of the scheme/hostname trimming feature.

When a partial URL is presented for history matching, it is scanned for common 
schemes and hostnames, such as "www.".  If the url begins with one of these 
strings, the prefix string is trimmed.  If the result gives no characters 
(i.e., your search url was "www.") then it abandons the search altogether.

This isn't what we want - it should keep going with the search.

I have a patch that fixes both cases above.

===

Here's another angle on this problem; put the URL    
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/releases/0.7/MozillaFirebird-
source-0.7.tar.gz into the history buffer.

Before we apply the substr comparison, the URL gets stripped of "http://ftp." 
so here's what happens:

1.  "f"      => nothing
2.  "ft"     => nothing
3.  "ftp"    => nothing
4.  "ftp."   => nothing
5.  "ftp.m"  => ftp.mozilla.org result

The patch above makes "ftp.mozilla.org" return at step 4 above.

With or without the patch, typing "moz" will make the ftp.mozilla.org result 
appear.

In order to make the ftp.mozilla.org result show up for steps 1-4, we would 
need to compare each history item several different ways; once with no 
trimming, once with common protocols trimmed, once with common hostnames 
trimmed.  I don't think this is a big enough problem to warrant this change, 
especially when we already provide a shortcut ("moz") once the user figures it 
out.

If someone disagrees with me on the http://ftp.moz  case above, we should open 
a separate bug.


Patch coming up.

Created attachment 139790
minor patch to nsGlobalHistory.cpp

this patch is based on trunk.  It would probably apply cleanly to 0.8 branch if
so desired.
Someone with authority should fix the bug summary.
I recommend:

given "www.", history entries of "www1.", "www2.", etc still appear despite not 
matching
