Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

Open a PDF document in Firefox with the built-in PDF viewer and then click on the Download toolbar button (icon).



Actual results:

A corrupted PDF document (larger in size) is saved to local storage, which does not open in Adobe Reader.  Note that right-clicking on the content area of the built-in PDF viewer and click "Save Page As" does save the correct PDF file.


Expected results:

The Download toolbar button or icon should have saved the non-modified, authentic PDF file being viewed.

Does it happen with every PDF or only one? If it's limited to one PDF, attach this PDF to the bug or provide URL.

In addition, could you try to reproduce the issue with a clean profile, please.

This is likely fixed in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/3634
Why don't we mark this fixed once it hits m-c?
I've observed the same, it is not fixed in v24.0

You need to test Firefox 26, it's not fixed in FF24/25.

Hi, 

after trapping into the issue and following the bug description and the links mentioned above:
I just tested nightly "firefox-26.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe" and it seems the issue is gone. The Github link, kindly mentioned above, indeed seems to describe the potential root cause. 

My personal workaround is to disable the inline PDF viewer in "about:config" (pdfjs.disabled = true) after viewing the file by using another Tab - in order to save the PDF by then pressing F5. After that I enable the viewer again.

It seems that most of the Support PDFs from Hewlett-Packard are affected (view not save), as it seems that the HP Download Servers do not always announce the filesize. The URL of the PDF files here are all relative, thus a permanent workaround until FF26 would be to change the browser - sad idea.

Thus, is it possible to raise prio for an earlier fix than FF 26?

Best,




Dyn.
