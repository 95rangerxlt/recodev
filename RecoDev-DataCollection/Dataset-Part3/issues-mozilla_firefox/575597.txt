STR:

1. Download a beta from ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/4.0b1-candidates/build1/
2. Start it up

Expected: feedback button to be in upper right
Actual: it's not there until the first time a survey appears

(note: this is different from bug 575666)

cc'ing marco in case this is related to the recent move of the bookmark toolbar button

Marking this as a b1 blocker at this time, though since the first notification comes almost instantly, we might let it go. Need to think about it a bit.

(Also: wasn't that first notification supposed to come after a delay of a few minutes?)
I filed this earlier than you, Mike :). Since this bug is already marked as a blocker, I'm duping my bug.

Ooops - I looked for dupes and everything. Alas!
I missed this because I was testing with the same profile each time; the bug only happens on a new profile.  (I have now verified this).

It's happening because the feedback button is not overlaid into the toolbar in XUL but is rather added to the Customize palette and then dynamically added to the toolbar on first run.  Since we pushed TestPilotSetup.globalStartup() to a ten-second delay in order to not interfere with Firefox startup, the code that adds it on first run isn't happening until ten seconds after startup.  Need to make sure that happens immediately; hopefully it won't do much to startup time.  I will attach a patch.
Will investigate why the notification is showing up so soon, too.  It is not supposed to show up until 10 minutes after startup (based on the pref extensions.testpilot.popup.delayAfterStartup).

Patch to show feedback button on startup instead of 10sec after startup

This patch moves the feedback button installation to the startup path, which ensures that it appears immediately on a new profile.  It should be tested for its effects on startup time.  I think it also fixed the bug that causes the notification popup to appear too early, but I will investigate further on that one.
> I think it also fixed

Nope.  Still happening.  Will fix and update the patch.

Fixes both the feedback button not appearing and the notification appearing too early.

OK, I have tested this change pretty thoroughly, and it fixes the notification problem (no notifications will appear until 10mins after startup, as designed) and the feedback button problem (appears immediately).  The new patch contains both fixes so it obsoletes the previous patch.
flagging in-litmus? to to add testcase coverage when creating new firefox profiles.  probably should automate this too.

r=me, landing now
Tony: would need to be beta-specific, there, as we don't ship this in final.
correct, i understood that, but forgot to note that here.  it'll be called out during beta testing cycles going forward.
