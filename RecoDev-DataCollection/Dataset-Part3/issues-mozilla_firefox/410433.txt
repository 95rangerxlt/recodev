When I call up the Applications page of Firefox on OS/2 I don't get any entries but instead the following messages on the error console:

Error: Cc['@mozilla.org/browser/shell-service;1'] is undefined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/preferences/applications.js
Line: 441
Error: gApplicationsPane is undefined
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/preferences.xml
Line: 669

I think we never implemented the shell service class on OS/2 because it wasn't necessary before.

That code should probably either fail gracefully, or be ifdefed HAVE_SHELL_SERVICE. I'll quickly review any patches, I should have caught this in the initial review!

fix

Thanks for the hint, didn't know about HAVE_SHELL_SERVICE. Not sure at the moment if null is the correct syntax for this in JS but it works without giving any other warnings when clicking around on the entries of the application prefpane.
Hmm, I suppose this works because all uses of _shellSvc are in try/catch blocks (because getting defaultFeedReader might throw). I think it would be clearer to also put the users of _shellSvc in ifdefs.

fix v2

I had thought that the try/catch blocks around were there for this purpose but OK. This version with additional ifdefs works fine, too.
Patch "fix v2" checked into trunk. Thanks for the help!
