The popup blocker now places a banner above the web page when a popup has been
blocked instead of placing an icon in the status bar.  However, the help page on
the subject still talks about the status bar icon. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox Help Contents
2. In Contents, go to Controlling Popups
3. Look at the section labeled "When a Popup Window Has Been Blocked"

Actual Results:  
"Every time a popup is blocked, an icon is displayed in the Firefox status bar
to indicate that a popup has been blocked."

Expected Results:  
It should have described the "information bar" that appears below the toolbar.

Good call.  Sometime soon I'll get to this (probably pre-1.0), but not right now.
The statusbar icon is still displayed when popups are blocked. Try
http://www.popuptest.com/
By left-clicking on the icon, you can allow popups for the current page, edit
popup blocker options, toggle the display of the info bar when popups are
blocked, and even show popups listed in the context menu. We should document that.

And we should indeed document the info bar shown by the popup blocker, and upon
extension installation. It is shown if popups or extension installations are
blocked and if the user has not chosen to not display the info bar in the former
case.
(Theme installations are no longer blocked.)
This is a rather noticeable absence, and we really should deal with it as the
current docs are incomplete with the introduction of the popup blocker and
software install bars.  I'm very unlikely to get to this.  Steffen?
Uh. I'll try, but I can't promise.

first shot at popups

This is for the popups only. I also removed some redundant information.
I used "Options" instead of &pref.pluralCaps; because that's what the menu
shows even on Linux. I also tried <strong> on the <li>s, but I didn't like it
that much.

Good by me.
Checked in br & trunk.

The software install and plugin finder info bar needs an description as well,
but that'll miss 1.0.
