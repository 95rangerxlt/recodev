v2

Alex, I'm removing the call to showRuntimePanel() as it fails sometimes. Basically, the popups tries to open, and during popupshowing, it's cancelled. It fails very very rarely (to reproduce, I need to run the test hundreds of time and clear my disk cache before running the tests, and it only happens on Linux), so it makes it very difficult to figure out what's going on. I thought that it could be a race with the busyUntil function that hides the popups, but if I comment out hidePopup(), it still happens. So it's not related to busyUntil. My guess is it's a focus issue.

Because it's hard to figure out what's going on and because calling showRuntimePanel is not required in this test, and because I don't want to block webidde just because of this, I just removed the call.

Alex, there's another timeout error. No need to review until I get a green try.
Michael, can you just review the build part?

Looks fine :)
Summary of the situation:
* test_runtime.html: play button is enabled 5 - intermittent on linux
* test_import.html: error: Already added

Other timeouts are cause by the "Already added" error.

Figured that we were not emptying IDB correctly: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=b741facb286c

Several oth runs: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=b741facb286c
All mochitests: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=2e5263124053

All green, but for some reason, osx 1.8 are taking forever to run the test (been waiting for 7 hours).

Summary of the changes I made:
- removeAllProjects (used to clean a test), was returning too early, next test could fail because IDB was not empty
- in test_runtime, I'm now using the packaged app, which doesn't have errors in it (the hosted app is not valid in the test, because of the chrome:// URL) and use the promise of busyUI() to block on testing the buttons

Looks great!

Few comments that sounds more related to whenever we will turn the pref on:
 - downloading templates fails by default (I imagine it is still being worked on?),
 - my app currently registered into app manager v1 get into v2 but all being named "--".

Otherwise, I played with WebIDE and everything looks great so far.

Yep. Waiting for the templates.

I thought I fixed that... I'll file a bug.
We will add the templates later.

Just added some logs to get more info about what's going on.
Well, I can't reproduce the orange. Now trying with all the mochitests: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=23f5c31f1025
On today's windows nightly, if I turn webide pref on, I can't open the app manager anymor:

It's been backed out.

Ryan, I didn't manage to reproduce the orange (ran the test ~100 times, see try builds). I'd like to re-land this patch with some extra logs if that works for you.

Shouldn't this be moved as a const at the top of file somewhere?

One question about this though: why is this required in this test?

Because in the failure, it says:

> 04:38:29     INFO -  119 INFO TEST-INFO | if you need more context, please use SimpleTest.requestCompleteLog() in your test

I'm not sure how useful it is though.

I'll address that in bug 1021528.
