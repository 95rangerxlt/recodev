STR:

1. Start with a clean/defaults-restored profile
2. Open customize mode
3. Drag the developer tools button between the search bar and the star button, on the navbar.
4. Drag the search box to the palette
5. click restore defaults

ER:
Defaults are restored

AR:
Default prefs are restored, but the devtools button stays in the navbar. :-\
Note also that the restore button is now disabled.

For added fun, drag the button to the panel and back to the navbar. Click Restore Defaults again. The search box now disappears. Something is very very very wrong. :-(

(after a restart, it goes away)

(P1/M9 because this is pretty amazingly broken... )

while resetting, shouldn't wrap/unwrap based on notifications,

So the issue is that buildArea does insertions which make our customize code wrap things, which then confuses stuff again later on. Not great. This is a test for this situation, and a pretty simple fix.
