You don't need to call addSubscriber if there's no callback. The same pattern is repeated a couple of times in this patch.

Calling this function without a callback probably doesn't make sense.

These changes definitely don't make sense.

1.) Please use if ("function" == typeof callback) to check if a callback was passed to the function.
2.) Callbacks are optional for the following functions:

* showTabView
* hideTabView
* showSearch
* hideSearch
* closeGroupItem
* hideGroupItem
* unhideGroupItem

3.) Please remove the checks for all other functions because if they're named like "when*" or "after*" it's obvious that we definitely want to wait for an event to occur and we need to pass a callback here. Functions like "newWindowWithState", "restoreTab", "newWindowWithTabView" pass the restored tab or created window to the callback so they should be required here too.

4.) Please use a context of 8 lines when creating a diff - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_customize_the_format_of_the_patches_Mercurial_creates.3f
5.) Thanks for the patch :)

Yeah, good catch, thanks!

No, this is unnecessary, please use if (callback)!

F+ with the fix for closeGroupItem().

We must ensure that .closeHidden() is called. So we want the "groupHidden" subscriber but need no "close" subscriber if no callback is given.

Hey Marcos, do you still want to be assigned to this bug or do you want me to finish the patch? Anyway, thanks for preparing!

You seem to never call this without a callback and there's probably no point in doing so.

> function showSearch(callback, win) {

This appears to be unused?

Yes, you're right. This doesn't seem sensible - changes reverted.

Interesting, didn't know that. Removed.
