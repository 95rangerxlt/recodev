We have never intended to expose "firefoxurl://" as a URL protocol. It caused a security vulnerability in the past (bug 384384).
"IE.FTP", "IE.HTTP", and "IE.HTTPS" keys don't have the "URL Protocol" named value.

Deleting the value explicitly because old installers may set the value.

Please wait to implement the nit as there will likely be some more comments.

I won't be able to finish reviewing this until next week because I need to setup some clean registry VMs.
Leaving the review request until then.

As far as I recall this is needed but I'll verify. If we do make changes here, once this lands we should also post a bug for seamonkey.

Seems like it's only needed for custom URL protocols. So this looks good.

I tried it on XP, Vista, and Win8 and it works fine.

On Vista and Win8 (where there's a defaults control panel item) I could still set the default protocol handlers for Firefox and Firefox showed up in the list of default handlers for HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols.

Why was checkin-needed set?
Sorry, I missed the bug number (I meant bug 884301).

hunreal, could you please post a new bug describing this problem? You can use the link at the bottom of the page named Clone this bug.  Please put exact steps on how to pin a shortcut if it is different from normal shortcuts that are autopopulated by the app. Thanks!
The removal of this registry value is causing some problems for some people (see bug 911158).
Emk, are you OK with me reverting this? I think that this bug was originally just a precaution and not an actual attack.
OK.
