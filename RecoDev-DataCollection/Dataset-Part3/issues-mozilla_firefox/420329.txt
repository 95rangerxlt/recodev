I have OSX Leopard on my Mac with the newest Java. I have some charts that I can't see created out of Java. I can see them in Camino, so I don't understand why I can't see them in FireFox. Should you not be using the same coding in Camino as FireFox? I have read some where online that this is due to Macs new Java in Leopard and you haven't found a fix for it. But again Camino works.

In Mozilla it gives me the option of going to get a plugin, but when I go to the page, there is no plugin. I used to have OSX Panther and Mozilla had no problem viewing these graphs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to http://www.hanengcharts.com/Chart_Pie.asp using a Mac with Leopard
Actual Results:  
No display of pie chart. Area just white

Expected Results:  
Pie chart seen.

I'm not able to reproduce this problem (testing with Firefox 2.0.0.12
on Mac OS X 10.5.2).

Moreover, I suspect that for those who _can_ reproduce it, the "cure"
is to scroll or resize the browser page.

If so, this bug is a dup of bug 412187.  And it can't be fixed until a
design change is made to all Mozilla.org browsers (as outlined at bug
416716).

Unfortunately, scrolling screen or resizing the browser window does not correct the problem. I have found that in the last 4 updates of FireFox this browser has run slower in loading pages than Safari. Especially in database pulled information. If found the entire browser running significantly slower than Safari, Camino, IE. Now this. Is there a preference on Mac Leopard that I can through away , that when FireFox relaunches it will put it back to correct this behaviour? I tried downloading a new version of FireFox, but that didn't solve my problem.
Since the update of .13 yesterday, my Java applets have begun to work again, thanks.
