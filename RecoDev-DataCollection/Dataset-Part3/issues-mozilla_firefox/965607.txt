browser-fxaccounts.js manages per-window UI like the widget contained in the Australis menu. At the same time it's also responsible for showing doorhangers when starting sync or to notify about errors.

We shouldn't show doorhangers for every open window but instead for the most recent non-popup browser window.

this looks magic - I think a comment indicating you are avoiding a reference to FxAccountsCommon in the top-level scope would be good
