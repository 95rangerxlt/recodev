Patch v1 - Build redit as unicode app.  Use unicode system calls for filepath manipulation and resource updating.  Use RAII classes.

In addition to dealing with unicode filepaths, this patch adds some Mozilla RAII classes to redit which means that redit now links to our glue libraries.  If this feels like overkill, I can revert that part of the patch.

Mossop: Are you the right person to review this patch?  If not, I can get someone from #windev to do the review.

Would be better to get someone who actually knows the win APIs, maybe jimm?

Chatted with jimm in #windev, he'll take over the review

Can this really ever be NULL? I think you want to check empty() here.

Patch v2 - Remove dependency on 732124. Check return value of _wsopen_s.

I've pushed this to try:

I've changed this to '$(XPCOM_STANDALONE_GLUE_LDOPTS)' but I was hoping bug 732124 would land soon :)

The MSDN article also says "In the case of an error, -1 will be returned through pfh (unless pfh is a null pointer)."  I've updated the patch to check for either/both.

Done. I've removed the space between the parenthesis and the rest of the line.

(NULL == updateRes) will  be true if BeginUpdateResourceW fails (ScopedResourceUpdate implicitly casts to a HANDLE).  I've verified this by making an executable file readonly and attempting to embed an icon in it.  We could equivalently check (ScopedResourceUpdate::empty() == updateRes).
