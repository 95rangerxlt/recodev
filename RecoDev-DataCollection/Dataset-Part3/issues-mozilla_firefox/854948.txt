Since recent GCLI changes context.environment.contentDocument always points to the content document from when GCLI was first opened.

It should obviously point to the current content document.

context.environment.contentDocument.location.href = the correct content document URI.
context.environment.contentDocument.body.innerHTML = HTML from the page when GCLI was first loaded.
Seems like the debugger gave me bad information. Seems like context.environment.contentDocument.location is null :o/
console.log(context.environment.contentDocument) gives HTMLDocument {"location":null}
