Check to make sure content window isn't null after paring document

Similarly to bug 1125396, I found this while working on browser-chrome tests. I assume that content is null if the content window was destroyed while we were off parsing the document, so I think this is also a valid error case.

(I couldn't figure out how to make dependent review board reviews, so I'm just uploading this the old school way.)

Check to make sure content window isn't null after paring document (Android patch)

This logic is also in Fennec!

I should see if there's a way we could move this logic into a shared place... maybe in ReaderMode.jsm.
