See the orange Windows 7 dt runs here: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=1681803bd065.  Looks like if there is another failure then a bunch of logspam from the netmonitor shows up.

This is somewhat recent (last few days), but I haven't narrowed it down to a single commit.

The first one I see on treeherder on fx-team is: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=067e21985d8d.  However, the previous push (which just doesn't happen to have any failures) looks more suspicious: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=2bda9fb3b5d6.

Guessing this started in Bug 862341 - Panos, can you see if that's right?
Yeah, I can see the following messages even on the green linux opt dt from: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=2bda9fb3b5d6:

Could be, I'll take a look on Monday when I'm back from OSCAL.
I'm guessing what's happening is that the request updating events are firing before the netmonitor view has been created, so when it's trying to dig into the view to get the URL it's failing: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/netmonitor/test/head.js#242.  We should probably pass along the URL in the update events so it doesn't rely on that.

Unfortunately can't push to try at the moment because the tree is closed, but this fixes the problem locally for me
Ongoing try push: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=023dc76034d8
Oh and by the way, if you like the patch and the try push looks good, feel free to check it in so it has a chance to make it into 40 without uplift.

Passing an object instead of an array I think would be cleaner and more future-proof, but since this is just for tests it's not a big deal. Thanks for fixing this!

I think I'll need to touch this again in Bug 1143224, so I'll switch it to an object there.
This missed the uplift, so please nominate for Aurora approval when you get a chance too.

Approved for uplift to aurora. This has baked on m-c for a while and should fix some test issues.
