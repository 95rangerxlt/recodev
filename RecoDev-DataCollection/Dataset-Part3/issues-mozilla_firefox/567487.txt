These two options are mutually exclusive, we should give the privacy setting precedence and disable the start up option when the user has indicated that Firefox should never remember history.

Note that we would also need some indication of why the option was disabled.

Patch (v1)

In this patch, if pb.autostart is enabled, I disable the 'Show my windows and tabs from last time' option, but do not change the underlying pref value (in case the user later turns pb.autostart off).

If the value of browser.startup.page is 3 and pb.autostart is enabled, I select the value 1 in the menu list, but don't touch the underlying pref value (which is ignored in reality anyway.)
gavin: ping?
gavin: reping?

Specifically, if we don't take this until the feature freeze, it will slip to Firefox Next.

It's kind of odd that the menu will show an item that doesn't reflect the pref, and that re-selecting the selected menu item will actually change the pref, but I don't know if there are any better options. Get ui-review, perhaps?

It's a bit weird, agreed â€” but it's also an edge case, so should be fine overall.
Beltzner: since this can be considered as an interaction change, beta7 is our last chance to take this for Firefox 4.

This is an edge case - it could land later than beta 7, IMO.

Do you mean that it _should_ land after beta 7, or that if it doesn't get to beta 7, the universe will not end and the human race will not be extinct?
I mean that I don't think there are any special constraints on when this lands :)
