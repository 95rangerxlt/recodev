The problem here is twofold:

1. When text is dark (top image), the shadow applied to the text of selected tab is also dark, leading to the text looking like it’s been “doubled up”. We can either apply a light-colored shadow or disable shadow entirely. (See bug 549346).

2. When text is light (bottom image), the shadow applied to the text in the chrome is inconsistent. Text shadows on inactive tabs and bookmarks toolbar texts have more blur, when compared to the shadow on the active tab. We should pick one value and apply it consistently throughout the chrome.

Where are the top and bottom images?

I can't reproduce this behaviour. The dark text colour should lead to a light highlight (and it does for me). Do you know what theme was used in the screenshot?

Dão, were you planning on handling this in a separate bug or is this no longer true?

My patch should fix that? I.e. it should make the selected tab inherit the text-shadow defined by the lightweight theme styles instead of using its own shadow. Unfortunately I can't currently test this on OS X.

I was testing using the Japanese Tattoo theme, but the behavior shows up on other light-colored themes, as well.

Japanese Tattoo

Ideally, when a light theme is chosen, we’d either apply a light-colored shadow or disable it.
