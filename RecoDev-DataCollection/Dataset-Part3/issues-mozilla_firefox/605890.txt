setting NEW, though I disagree with the change to blue
I agree with the change to something other than green.

Green on Windows is reserved for progress bars. As it was determined, the throbbers are not progressing indicators and should not be green.
I agree. Really the only reason they are green right now is to mimic a native progress bar, which they are not. If that argument is considered invalid, then it comes down to aesthetics. Visually, green does not work well with the native Win7 theme. The blue Mac throbber looks much better.
I agree too. Why is the throbber the only item of the interface where the green color appears? The blue fits far better in the aero theme.
Fixed by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1177136 it seems.
