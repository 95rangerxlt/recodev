I don't know how Axel's systems would need, but ta-LK isn't in
 http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/browser/locales/all-locales
so the build systems don't check for pushes or build nightlies. 

Suspect there is a better component for this.
Actually, all-locales is what's needed here.
It is still ta-LK is not in
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/browser/locales/all-locales

What is needed to add ta-LK to all-locales as a locale which is included in Firfox and Thunderbird previous releases.
Taking, I should get to that tomorrow.
Thanks Axel
Landing a bunch more, too.
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/10439d6e1db2, FIXED.

CCing the localization aliases, folks, you now have mozilla-central/l10n-central builds, working towards Firefox 4. I migrated the 1.9.2 content as good as I could, which means, I didn't do anything for es-CL, the rest should be good.

es-CL needs to do whatever they used to do, really, the hg repos are totally unconnected.

Nightlies will start to come out tomorrow, at http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-l10n/.

See the posts in the newsgroups or poke us on #l10n on how to get your local setup worked out.
ivarela, marquinos, please start watching the ast@localization.bugs alias? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email#new_watched_by_you is the form to add that.
