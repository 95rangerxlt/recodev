Looks good. Do we have tests for this functionality already in the tree somewhere?

I don't believe so, at least not that I could find.

Per reviewboard let's get a test added here.

Test in Bug 1142240 passes before and after this change.

Dave, a try push indicated a few test breakages when switching to remote. It appears they were just problems with the test themselves, so I've updated them. The main part of the patch is unchanged.

Backed out (next to bug 1142240) in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/7b259d8a61a8 for being the likely cause of some new intermittent privatebrowsing test failures:

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=2327926&repo=fx-team
Not sure this needs to be M6. It would be nice to have it, but I don't think it should block.
I'm not going to be finishing up this work. Whoever picks this up needs to look into the test failures and probably update a few tests to handle about:privatebrowsing being remote.

Something that might be worth doing first though is just landing my modifications to about:privatebrowsing without actually flipping it remote so that those changes don't bit rot. Once the tests are fixed making it remote would just requiring adding the flag to AboutRedirector.cpp

Rebased and pushed to try again:

Hi Felipe, want to confirm if you are taking this bug for IT 40.2?
BTW, looks like there isn't much to do here. Try is quite green so far and we could probably just land it. I'll do that once all runs finish and there still are no failures.
Try run was all green:

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/6be3314c79db

Should fix and land bug 1142240 next.
