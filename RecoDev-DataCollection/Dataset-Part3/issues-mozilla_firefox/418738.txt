Because google search results are actually linked to google that redirect to the real page, the destination page doesn't get its frecency updated because it's a transition redirect. This causes places to have -1 frecency unnecessarily because they can't be updated and prevent other invalid frecencies from getting calculated.

We can address this by treating the original action (link visit) in place of the redirect visit.

Patch is part of the fix for bug 417810.
