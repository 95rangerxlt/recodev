bustage fix
This was done without asking anyone on the place steam.

We need to communicate to our testers how to export their bookmark first, not just throw them into the old system and expect them to figure it out.

I am backing this out until we have the communications aspect sorted out.
Note that I can't get a storage+noplaces build to work because of a form history build config problem. I filed bug 335558 for this.

I checked in Mike's patch again. Places should now be disabled. 
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
