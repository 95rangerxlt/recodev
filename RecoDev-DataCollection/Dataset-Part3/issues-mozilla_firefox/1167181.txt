Bug 1161072 identified that some getOriginalLocation request were done after the tests was declared as done!
That's because many browser_computer_*.js tests are not waiting for the SelectorView instances to be done loading, especially the updateSourceLink call in its constructor, which ends up dispatching a getOriginalLocation.

We should ensure waiting for all stuff to be done with each test before proceeding to the next one!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

computed-view-property-expanded was fired too early, before SelectorView finished initializing and especially finished its getOriginalLocation request.

Looks good.

This patch is not enough, browser/devtools/styleinspector/test/browser_computedview_matched-selectors_01.js still dispatch some getOriginalLocation requests on shutdown.

Looks like I also need to delay the promise returned by refreshMatchedSelectors
as it is being called by test without waiting for computed-view-property-expanded event.
