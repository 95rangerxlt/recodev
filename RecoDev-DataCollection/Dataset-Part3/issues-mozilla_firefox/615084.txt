Minefield (as of Nov.28th 2010) doesn't keep the position of the bookmarks toolbar items (the contents of the bookmarks toolbar you can drag into the same toolbar as the awesomebar in 3.6 and below).
This bug disables the possibility to condense bookmarks and location bar in the same toolbar, saving vertical space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Show bookmarks toolbar. Open customize, and drag and drop "Bookmarks toolbar items" next to the location/awesomebar.
2.Hide bookmarks toolbar. Bookmarks should show in the right location.
3.Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks will be gone from the interface as opposed to 3.X behavior. Repeating the steps will hide the bookmarks again.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks should appear in the selected location after restarting.
