The only way to download dictionaries currently (without knowing the link) is through the context menu in text fields. When there is no dictionary installed, there is no spellcheck menu so there is no link to download dictionaries.

It kind of sucks to display the spellcheck menu on every textarea when there is no way we can spellcheck. I suggest having a button in the pref panel next to the spellcheck option that brings up the same thing that the context menu does as well. But I'm not sure this would work because it needs to bring up a web page, but we can't because the pref panel is open. Beltzner, any ideas?

I think a good solution would be:

If a textarea would otherwise be spellcheckable but we have no dictionaries installed, then show the normal spellcheck menus on the context menu, but with all options removed except the ones to download dictionaries.  In other words, eliminate the useless options in the menu (like enabling spellchecking), but not everything.

I think whether we also provide somewhere to "get dictionaries" besides the context menu is a separate question, and one equally applicable to en-US.  Maybe we want somewhere in add-ons or prefs to get dictionaries regardless of what's installed.  That seems like a worthwhile separate bug.

I think that's the best place for it, yes. At least, that's where I was looking for it (when beltzner told me to look for dictionaries). Things which are related (such as the spellchecker option and dictionaries) should be grouped together.

If I'm reading this patch right, and I like to think that I am, it's suggesting that we simply add a "Add Dictionaries..." item to the bottom of the shortcut menu for text areas when no dictionaries are available. Which is the right thing to do.

Brett, after a quick bake and test cycle on trunk, please nominate this for 181. Thanks.
(ugh, ze clobber due to reload-not-picking-up-the-changes-screwiness)
Beltzner: your explanation is correct.

Fixed on trunk, leaving open for branch.
Note that I've also filed bug 349945 to try and mitigate the god-awful UE of not having dictionaries shipped with some locales (see http://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Dictionaries for the current licensing status)
Brett, if you close this bug as FIXED once this is on branch, it's probably worth filing a followup bug for comment 0.
