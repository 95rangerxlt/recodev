Hi,

I am interested to contribute as this is a good first bug and I believe its in Java. 
Could someone guide me how to approach or start working on this issue.
All of this work is in JavaScript, not Java, are you comfortable in that language? Also, with the rendering of objects (like AudioBuffer) different now, this may no longer be an issue (the editability of non-editable properties)
Ok.I was assuming this to be related to Java.Thanks for that.Where can I find Java related bugs for a newbie.
We don't have too many Java projects, but some are listed here http://www.whatcanidoformozilla.org/#!/progornoprog/proglang/java/
Hey !
I'm interested to fix this bug. Can somebody assigns it to me? Thank!
I'll try helping Raphaël to fix this bug, assigning him.

Make 'readonly' AudioParams uneditable.
Nice! This adds the 'lock' icon to the VariablesView component to the appropriate parameters, but still allows the `_onEval` method to be called, and then the change sent to the actual underlying component. Since the object displayed isn't an exact representation of the underlying AudioNode, I think some extra magic will be necessary, and probably just in the `_onEval` method, check again to see if it's readonly/un-writable and just ignore the attempted change.

Thanks again Raphaël!
And the test should probably be very similar to ./browser_wa_properties-view-edit, but in a different file (using the doc_complex-content.html, and using the script processor's bufferSize param there). Probably just call it `./browser_wa_properties_view-edit-02.js` or something, using the same techniques as the first one, but different nodes and check to make sure that the property is not updated.

Hi Jordan,

I addressed your nits, but it seems that bug 994258 prevents this line from being called:
http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webaudioeditor/webaudioeditor-view.js#483

I updated this bug to be blocked on bug 994258, because the latter needs to be fixed for this test to work.

Nevermind, just found a way to make the test works independently from the other bug.

This will also need UI_SET_PARAM_ERROR defined in webaudioeditor-view.js.

I also suspect that this will cause merge conflicts due to bug 1027852 affecting the same area, so once the review comments are addressed, this may need to be rebased if bug 1027852 has already landed so we can get a clean merge.

Thanks! Almost there :)

This should be `browser_wa_properties-view-edit-02.js` (note the differences between _ and -), and if we name this, we should also change the name of `browser_wa_properties-view-edit` and add a -01 there.

Also, this test should also be commented out as it will have the same failures as the other test due to bug 1010423

We should start a listener for EVENTS.UI_SET_PARAM_ERROR here, but yield after the failure below:

Here we should yield for the above `errorEvent` to ensure it was called at some point during the modification:
