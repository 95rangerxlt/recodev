Currently the UITour highlights the search provider icon. This breaks with bug 1088660, and we also want the ability to highlight additional elements. This patch fixes the highlight (to highlight the magnifying glass) and also lets the tour highlight the "Change Search Settings" link.

Not completely sure what the UITour uses this for, but getting the magnifying glass icon when requesting something called "searchProvider" may be misleading.

It seems to me that with this code you'll only get the "Manager Search Engines…" menuitem of the old UI. This node still exists in the binding of the new UI, but it's never going to be visible (and I'll remove it once we can remove the old UI).

The "Change Search Settings" button has the anonid search-settings and is part of the browser-search-autocomplete-result-popup binding in urlbarBindings.xml

This adds a new target, searchIcon for the magnifying glass and updates the searchPrefsLink target to work right. It doesn't do anything about showing the popup but since it didn't in the past I assume that is fine.

With the new UI the ability to show the searchEngines menu is broken. I haven't stripped the code but I have commented out the test. I'm assuming this may get fixed/removed in bug 1101670.

This seems reasonable given what I know of the search UI. I don't know much about UITour.

If you comment out this code instead of removing it, I should you should include a comment explaining why it's commented out.

This is supposed to read "I think you should".
Turns out that test was disabled by the searchbar patch anyway so I just left it alone.
