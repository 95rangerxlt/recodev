I don't know if the problem comes from gnome or firefox. So I report here, tell
me if I am wrong.

First, in Firefox, Edit > Preferences > Settings > Advanced > Proxy settings...
I choose "use system settings".
In System > Preferences > Proxy, I choose the proxy, ok, it works. Firefox use
correctly the proxy system settings.

Except for one point : in advanced configuration in gnome proxy settings, I can
choose the hostlist to ignore, for example "localhost", which is a good point.
But those settings are totally ignored by firefox : if at work I go to
localhost, it tries to resolve "localhost" connecting to the proxy (and doesn't
resolve it).

If in firefox, instead of "use proxy system settings", I use "manual
configuration", and copy EXACTLY the same settings than those in gnome proxy
settings, especially in "no proxy for", I put "localhost", and it works.

So... there is a little bug somewhere... gnome? firefox? Don't know at all...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a proxy.
2. Configure proxy system settings in gnome, with "no proxy for : localhost".
3. Configure "use system settings" for proxy in firefox.
4. Launch a server (apache) on your system for example
5. Try to connect to localhost...
Actual Results:  
It tries to connect to the proxy and resolve "localhost".

Expected Results:  
To directly connect to localhost (it is defined in /etc/hosts)

OK, RC1 updated in ubuntu repositories, it works !

Thank you :)
I am using Ubuntu Hardy Heron (8.04 LTS) and i have this same problem. I also have all the latest updates (Firefox got updated to 3.0.2 yesterday), and this problem still exists. There's also a confirmed bug filed on Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/204616) but i believe this is more of a Firefox problem than an Ubuntu one.
Ok, ignore my last comment. I can confirm the problem is solved, but the problem now is on the Ubuntu's default configuration for those exceptions, so nothing to do with Firefox itself.
@Tiago: I think this is in fact a problem with Firefox.  Ubuntu's default configuration includes 127.0.0.0/8, but Firefox still tries to use the proxy for 127.0.0.1

I can confirm this as well, using Ubuntu 9.10 and Firefox 3.5.5 [1]. I've setup this proxy ignore rule (using Gnome's proxy preferences):
 172.18.0.0/16

I was hoping that it would allow me to reach all servers in that particular subnet (172.18.*.*) but it didn't work. Explicitly adding the server(s) I want access to directly, one entry for each IP address, works though.

I've also tried a suggested workaround [2], using a wild-cards, which didn't work.

I couldn't find a related issue for this last pair of comments. Are we missing something (or simply didn't crawl enough)? Should this unexpected behavior be moved to a separate bug?
