The "noSuchActor" error packet in `DebuggerServerConnection.prototype.onPacket` has no error message. This makes debugging harder because you have to drill down to look at the packets to see the cause, rather than having a useful message reported in the console.

You mentioned that there could be multiple causes for this error => multiple error messages. Where could I look for more info ? Thanks

There can be multiple causes, but that doesn't really matter. All the error needs to do is explain what's happening. I think the message you've added does that well enough!
Thanks. Is there anything else I need to take care of ?
Nope! Thanks.
