Patch (Mac only)

First version of the prototype, implemented as a patch. Works only on Mac (because I made the CSS changes only in browser/themes/osx).

I'll now work on converting this to an add-on, for easier testing.

Add-on, Mac only

This is the same thing, as a restartless add-on.

I haven't looked at the Windows/Linux CSS yet, so try this only on Mac for now.

I don't know if there are compatibility issues with older Firefox versions, so I've marked it as compatible only with current nightlies.

Known bug: the first time the panel is shown after the add-on is installed or the browser is started, no suggestions are shown in the panel. Closing the panel and reopening it is enough for the bug to disappear. I have no idea of what's causing this, as I can't reproduce it when applying the patch-version to my local build. Not sure how important this is to fix.
I love this.  Only caveat is that the one-shot searches should be keyboard-accessible for a11y/keyboard only use.
Oh, and I'd be interested to see how the 65x26 icons work in this context, they'd definitely be more visible/identifiable.  That or 32x32 might be better.

I think you are right that it looks better on Windows without rounded corners. Especially as without tweaking the corners the panel gets automatically a shadow that match the shadow of the awesomebar's panel.

This patch applies on top of attachment 8512583. It addresses most of the requests I've received so far.

Here is what I currently have left in my todo list:
- implement the keyboard navigation behavior spec'ed by Philipp
- show a menu when clicking the magnifying glass icon of the search box.
- port all the theme updates to the Windows and Linux themes.
- [if we still care about having these changes as an add-on] update the add-on (the in-content version of the pref pane may be challenging to port to the add-on, as in-content preferences use preprocessing in several places).
- Check how much of this applies to mozilla-beta / what needs fixing/porting.

If you've asked me for anything that's neither in that list nor in the current version of the prototype, please remind me :-).

So maybe searchbar-ooheader-before, searchbar-ooheader-searchtext, searchbar-ooheader-after

so essentially maxRemoteResults means now maxResults.. But that's not gonna be enforced unless there are remote results? (comment above says "This limit is only enforced if remote results are also returned"). So in theory if remote results are off, 11 local results can show up and still show a scrollbar, right?

Yes, but the conditions are non-trivial: any change to the list of hidden one off engines, any change to the default engine, any change to the searchbox size (width) would require a rebuild. Let's look at this later.

Yes it's a known edge case. I also know and edge case that could cause us to show slightly less than 10 results when 10+ were available. I'd like to clean this up in a dedicated bug.

Additional fixes

Fix a few bugs that have been identified while testing the previous try builds:
- using "paste" in the context menu of the searchbox didn't make the go button appear (switching the event handler from "keyup" to "input" fixes this)
- while testing this patch, I've noticed that dropping some text to the searchbox correctly searches for the text immediately, but doesn't make the go button appear; also fixed by this patch.
- The command+up/down (and command+mouse wheel) keyboard shortcuts of the old UI could cause users to change their default search engine with the new UI without noticing. The recommendation I got when I mentioned this to UX was that it's a perfect opportunity to get rid of these shortcuts.

It's the expected UX that the text field stays focused at all time and the left/right arrows are reserved for navigation within what has been typed in the text field.

Keyboard navigation uses both up/down arrows and the tab key.

We are not satisfied with it yet and it will be improved next week; however feel free to file bugs if there are specific behaviors you think should be improved. Better file a dupe than miss something important :).

Polish CSS for Windows/Linux - fixed

Same patch without the -moz-border-colors: none; lines; I verified that things work without them, I must have been confused yesterday evening.
Relanded: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/c53b86f05fd2
Can someone please explain why this patch landed on the beta branch without any approval from drivers? Also without any baking on Nightly, and Aurora first, nearly at the end of the 34.0 beta cycle?
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

whimboo: I think there was no "baking" because this is related to (or needed for) for the new search UI that Kamil is working on testing. Most of us only found out about his yesterday when the announcement went public about the deal with Yahoo. But yeah it probably still should have been nominated for tracking so I'm doing that now.
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
I'm changing the bugs found overnight by the  Softvision team  to block fx34 (bug 1101642) instead of 1088660.  They couldn't see 1101642 until a couple of hours ago.  Sorry for the bug spam.
Gavin asked me to switch these back to 1088660 for now. So there will be more bugmail.
I found the following issues with the implementation that just landed in the beta channel. As I'm not used to Bugzilla I'm posting them here. Please feel free to file bug reports if you agree with the issues.

Missing features:

- Can't remove search engines

- Can't change the order of the alternative search engines

- Can't add keywords

- Can't modify keywords

Breaks the UX:

- Can't open search results of an alternative search engine in a new tab (both CTRL click and mousewheel click will open it in the same tab)

- TAB selects the next search engine instead of the next search result (unexpected behavior, e.g. the address bar and Google both select the next result)

- Also if you TAB through the alternative search engines, the default search engine has no highlight

- Some search engines have the same icon (e.g. multiple versions of Wikipedia) - the name of the search engine should be displayed (mouse over is not enough)

- Can't see which search engine is currently the default without opening the dropdown or hovering over the search field

Minor UI related issues:

- Hovering with the mouse over the search field displays the default search engine; hovering over the icons (magnifying glass and arrow) just displays "Search"

- The text size is rather small, I don't think such small text is used anywhere else

- "Add $searchengine" has a weird border

- The magnifying glass has a different color than every other icon in the address and search bar (Windows 8)

- Hovering over the magnifying glass icon just changes it to a darker gray, every other icon in the address and search bar has some kind of glow

General:

- If you focus the empty search field and press DOWN the search history appears, but above the alternative search engines the text says "Search for  with:"

Overall I would argue this feature doesn't belong into the beta channel yet, and certainly not the release channel.
I found some more, sorry for the second post.

- Unnecessary dividers are shown if the user has not enough alternative search engines configured to fill a row

- Can't navigate the alternative search engines with LEFT and RIGHT, only TAB, TOP and DOWN. This is rather unexpected, because the are lined up horizontally.

- Can't use TAB to auto complete the search with the first search result anymore

"Unless there's a special reason for doing so, the expectation is that patches will ride the usual trains. That gives things times to bake and be tested before hitting non-Nightly audiences."

This isn't just landing on beta, it's landing real close to the end of beta ...
The icon for the search engine should not be changed to the magnifying glass search icon until the bar underneath the search bar shows what search engine should be used. This is because the user needs to immediately see what search engine they will be using as they direct their eyes to the search bar.

Right now, the default search engine isn't even shown at all unless there is text in the search bar, even when clicking the icon.
The functionality of having the drop down list of search engines needs to be returned. Unlabeled icons are difficult to use, and also a pain to use in the grid format for a person with many search engines.

I like your idea of using the tab button to switch search engines. But some people use the tab button to scroll through the search suggestions. I don't know how many people do this, but this way, it works the same as the address bar with both tab and arrow buttons to scroll down suggestions.I don't see why you had to use special icons for this though. So complicated.
Your idea of searching immediately on click when you click the search engine is a terrible idea because in the past, that was not the functionality when clicking on the drop down. And the user may not want to search with the keyword they are using on that search engine.

Also, if you didn't know, by changing the default search engine, you also change the right click "Search 'example engine' for 'keyword' ". The way it is now, you are forced to go into "Change Search Settings" just so you can switch this.



I could probably say more, but I feel burned out after analyzing this so much. I think what you should do is to ONLY have the new search icons bar that you made, show up when the user starts typing in or clicks on the whitespace search bar (with or without pre-typed text). Whatever you do, make sure that clicking on the icon works the same way as it always has, the default search engine icon will always be shown at least once to the user at all times, and the normal functionality when clicking on the icon in order to change the default search engine within two steps is still available.
Another issue:

There is no visual difference between past searches and search suggestions anymore.

This change breaks the compatibility of Second Search (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/second-search/).

I think the SearchSuggestionController.jsm change is needed because "A promise chain failed to handle a rejection" causes
mochitests to fail on 36 but not 34.

Searching a bit more shows my guess is correct "Bug 1016387 - Uncaught
async Promise errors should cause mochi tests to fail" landed on 35.


The other test fix I made looks a lot like it's the same thing
as bug 1104654 so it would be needed on beta as well. I'm just not sure we should land test fixes on beta at this point, given that it's already been
merged to release.

Givent that little time, it’s even more ridiculous that this skipped Nightly completely and landed on beta directly. I always thought that the release system (central -> aurora -> beta -> final) was there to make sure that only polished things will be pushed out to the general public. Skipping two major steps now, and also landing it this short before the final release on beta seems really careless.

Comment on attachment 8524175
Combined beta patch

I had previously given flo-retina verbal approval for all branches on this bug. Cleaning up the approvals now.
Where are my keyboard shortcuts?
What if my icons are all same and I can't change that?
This also breaks being able to switch search engines for the context menu search (select text, 'Search <provider" for "<text>"'). In previous Fx versions, changing this is reasonably easy using the search provider dropdown, but it's no longer possible without heading into the preferences.

While this change seems to be great for improving the one-off search flow, IMO it completely breaks it for uses outside of that. If you have multiple search engines that you use regularly, say MDN and Google, it's now practically impossible to use them.
Is there a bug covering a visual pass to this feature ? As much as I like it I don't think it's really nice visually (one example : the dropdown arrow appearing on hover is really too close to the search lens) The work done in bug 1047354 could also be taken into account concerning the search field (mockup : http://people.mozilla.org/~mmaslaney/Search/Autocomplete-dropdown.png ).

No, please file bugs blocking this one for things that you think should be polished.

This specific icon was from :shorlander, please CC him if you file a bug.

I was mainly asking and maybe UX folks have already discussed that, so I'm needinfo'ing my comment for answer from the concerned people.

I wasn't aware of that. Waiting on the needinfo too.

Two more bugs to add as dependencies: bug 1107137 and bug 1107292 (one is probably a duplicate).
Just tried on 34.0.5 on a fresh profile. Then tried to switch back, which doesn't restore the behavior even in new tabs of the same session. Will raise a separate bug on it.

I also have 2 problems

1) duplication of icons (I use google and google verbatim, google images and google images HD, DuckDuckGo and DuckDuckGo (no filter))
2) wide search box - I put the search box on the main menu so it stretches very far to the right - icons can be very far right as a result making the oneoff click even more difficult 

(2) is probably a classic edge case, so not this important
(1) is a bit of a usability problem, can we allow showing / modifying labels?

Also personally I find a plain dropdown selection easier and faster than reaching for an icon, YMMV.

Shorlander did a visual design pass on this. The implementation doesn't match it 100%, but it's very close. If you find issues, the best way is to file separate bugs that reference this one :)
Not entirely Mozilla's problem, but I'm concerned that this strange new behaviour got pushed out to Ubuntu LTS as part of the trusty security repository just over a month after it's development began, apparently fast tracked by skipping due process. At least it appears that it's been done transparently and it's had some eyes on it.

What worries me the most is when I go in and uncheck all the available options, the new ugly buggy behaviour is still there (in version 34). Couldn't this have just been an extension for people that want this feature? I like nice clean simple default or at least provide us with an option to disable such bloat.
After looking at your screenshots I realised that my Quick Search looks nothing like it was intended to so I've just submitted bug 1111868 for that. Along with the other bugs I've found this new quick search has been very disruptive, even after going in to about:config and toggling browser.search.showOneOffButtons I find that the most irritating bugs are still in effect (bug 1012370 and bug 1107292). So I guess what I'd actually like to see here is an option in the settings menu to revert to a well tested, mature Quick Search bar.

I can see what you've attempted could be useful to people, I just think time would have been better spent testing and debugging instead of putting some fancy first-use tour in to advertise it. So far it's been far more disruptive to me that any possible usefulness I might get from it may have made up for.
