User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130307023931

Steps to reproduce:

Changed stylesheet using the Inspector and refreshed the page.


Actual results:

Leaving this page will close the inspector and the changes you have made will be lost. Clicked leave page. The page refreshed but the inspector did not close. If you then open the inspector another inspector window will open, but it will conflict with the previously unclosed inspector window. Closing the close button for the inspector window does not close the window.


Expected results:

The inspector should have closed.

Two Inspectors
Is it reproducible?
If you leave the page, the Inspector should close. if you stay on the page, modifs are kept, the Inspector stays open and the page doesn't refresh.
It isn't through a specific sequence of actions, but I find it happens about once a day. It does usually happen after modifying styling in the browser. If I leave the page, the Inspector seems to try and close but the DOM inspector and right hand side style inspector stays open.
Could you try Aurora? http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/
I think that this problem is resolved there (and Beta too)

Thanks.
Fairly sure this is fixed with the new Toolbox.
