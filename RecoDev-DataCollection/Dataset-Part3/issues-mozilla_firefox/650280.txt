In reply to Comment 1, I'm adding some screenshots of the problem, as for me it is unclear whether it's the same thing that causes the issue (as in bug 628082). Please have a look at them. Thanks

Oh, I was wrong, this is not the same issue.  Thanks for correcting me!  :-)

Tim, is this something that you can take a look at?

This is not really needed, as the private browsing service will ignore this if privateBrowsingEnabled is false.

The private browsing service will do nothing but for some reason starts a transition:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/privatebrowsing/src/nsPrivateBrowsingService.js#507

So if I remove the line the tests fail because there is an ongoing transition while the next test is started.

Oh, that's a bug.  We should be bailing out of the setter method there early (before the try block).  Can you please file a bug?  I promise a speedy review if you also attach a patch.  ;-)

Ehsan, can you review this? I'm phasing out my review duties, and would like to spread the Panorama code knowledge around.

Review of attachment 526931:

The patch looks good in general.  r=me with the nits below fixed.

This should no longer be necessary with the patch in bug 651643?  (I'd like to ask you to land this once bug 651643 has been fixed).

Is this change (and the other changes to this test) related to this bug?  If not, I'd rather for you to move them into another bug.

As a general rule, I prefer the "one bug per issue" model, as it would make it far easier to come back to a bug in the future and follow along the rationale for the changes made in that bug.

Alright, let's first fix bug 651643.

Removed other changes as they're only cleanup and unrelated.

patch v2

I moved the hideSearch() call to a place that is called when entering/leaving pb mode. So we don't need that call in two different places. Also the second call was erroneous because it was only called when (self._privateBrowsing.wasInTabView) - when we started PB mode while in Panorama.
