Runtime details will says root is "unknown" if you don't have a new enough to ADB Helper to check it.

We should suggest updating the add-on to be more clear about the issue.

Isn't the addon supposed to be auto-updated?

Yes, but people can disable updates for all add-ons or specific add-ons.

:mdas, what was your situation?  Did you have to do a manual add-on update because you had disabled auto updates, or was something else going on?
It didn't auto-update and I didn't really look into it much (maybe a pref was turned off?), I just removed it and installed the new one.
Okay, so we can't know for sure.  Regardless, there is no harm is saying something more helpful than "unknown".
Hey I'd like to work on this bug. How do i begin??
In WebIDE's Runtime Info panel[1], there is a string we show if the user does not have a version of ADB Helper that supports the right methods.

At the very least, we should extend that string to suggest that the user check that they have 0.4.0 or later of the add-on.  We could also go a bit further and inspect the add-on metadata to see what version they do have to present a more specific message.

Ok so instead of unknown, we can make it such that it checks what version of the add-on is currently present on the user's system and displays an appropriate message.  Correct?
Yes, that sounds right.  The simplest version would be to just change the string to state that 0.4.0 or greater is needed.
Hi! I'm interested to fix one bug, but I'm new no bugzilla. I want to work in this bug and try to fix it until 30th october. Could someone mentor me?
Yussif, you are welcome to give it a try.

To get started with our code base, see the hacking[1] page.

I believe the problem is well-defined in previous comments, but feel free to flag me as "needinfo" below if you have further questions.

So we change "unknown" to "requires version 0.4.0 or greater" ?

Yes, something like that.  Perhaps "unknown (requires ADB Helper 0.4.0 or later)".
Thanks :) I'll get on it as soon as possible.
Can i still work on this bug?

Cool, this seems like the right idea.  I've noted something to fix below.

When we change the string value of an existing string, we need to modify the string ID in some way[1].

Sometimes we do this by adding a number to the end of the ID.  In this case, it looks like "unkown" at the end of the ID is a misspelling of "unknown", so you can take care of this by fixing the misspelling (and also updating the page where this string ID is used).

Great, this looks good to me!

Pushed to try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=b483f1579be4

Add checkin-needed assuming Try looks good.
Great. Thanks!
