I am unable to install new search capabilities from http://mycroft.mozdev.org .
The problem seems to be in the javascript handling as when i click on the link
to install a plugin I get the following errors in the javascript console:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004003
(NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIRDFService.GetDataSource]"  nsresult: "0x80004003
(NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)"  location: "JS frame ::
file:///F:/MozillaFirebird/components/nsSidebar.js :: nsSidebar :: line 67" 
data: no]
Source File: file:///F:/MozillaFirebird/components/nsSidebar.js
Line: 67

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIRDFService.GetDataSource]"  nsresult:
"0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)"  location: "JS frame ::
file:///F:/MozillaFirebird/components/nsSidebar.js :: nsSidebar :: line 67" 
data: no]

I believe that this is a regression of Bug 21953

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://mycroft.mozdev.org
2. i then try an install any of the search plugins by clicking on the link 
3. there is no response from the browser  and two javascript errors are thrown

Actual Results:  
plugins not installed

Works for me with Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6b)
Gecko/20031129 Firebird/0.7+

Can anyone confirm this for Windows?
Works for me using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b)
Gecko/20031130 Firebird/0.7+

Please try installing into a new directory and creating a new profile, using the
MozillaFirebird.exe -p switch, and report your results here


OK, i played around with new profiles, different directories and even different
install methods. I narrowed it down to a problem with the new official installer
for windows. I downloaded and unpacked the latest nightly zip and ran with a new
profile and was able to add plugins. It also worked with a new directory, new
profile and seb's unofficial installer. However, when using the official
installer with a new profile and in a new directory adding mycroft plugins failed. 

ANyone else able to confirm using the official installer?
further note: 

unpacking the zip to the default directory and using the original profile also
allows installation of search plugins. Seems like a definite problem with the
installer. 
I have just confirmed this fails with the installer build from the 29th, but
works fine with the installer build from the 30th.

Can someone with enough privileges please mark this as fixed.
Fixed as per user comment #5. Thanks to all of you.
