When first installed it works fine.  Once you customize the navigation bar as
detailed in steps to reproduce, the OK button of the preferences dialog does not
work.  It does not save the changes or close the dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
a. Delete firebird directory and profile directories (Mozilla, Phonenix) in
Application Data.
1. Install Firebird by extracting to "C:\Program Files\mozilla.org"
2. Start Firebird Profile Manager by running "C:\Program
Files\mozilla.org\MozillaFirebird\MozillaFirebird.exe" -p
3. Create profile called 'Will'
4. Start Firebird
5. Open preferences dialog and change homepage to verify OK button works at this
point.
5. Right click on navigation bar and click customize.
6. Drag home page icon off bar to icon palette.
7. Click Done on icon palette
8. Open preferences dialog and change homepage.
9. Click OK Button - it doesn't work.
Actual Results:  
OK button does not save changes or close dialog

Expected Results:  
OK button should have saved changes and closed dialog

You can close the browser and come back in but it is still broken.  I haven't
tested other customizations to see if they cause the same problem.  I normally
run without navigation bar or bookmarks bar and have everything in top toolbar.
 I noticed the problem and reduced it to these steps from a 'clean' install.

Also tried it with:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031021
Firebird/0.7+

And it exhibits the same behaviour.
Firebird != Seamonkey, don't mix tracker bugs please.

I think I know what's causing this actually, but I'm going to dig a little
before I confirm or dupe this.  It does work when clicking to use current
page/use blank page or whatnot.

-> tweak summary to reflect exact problem.

cc-ing noririty, I think this is Blake's checkin for the tooltip issue (bug
184801) from a couple months back, based on what works and what doesn't.  Thoughts?
Related to bug #219368 ?
Any progress on the bug?
Was it the checkin?
I think this can be fixed by either changing this line in onOK() in
pref-navigator.js:

domWin.document.getElementById("home-button").setAttribute("tooltiptext",
parent.homepage);

to something like this:

var homeButton = domWin.document.getElementById("home-button");
if (homeButton) homeButton.setAttribute("tooltiptext", parent.homepage);

or just wrap the line in a try/catch. I don't know which is best (sorry, I'm
totally clueless when it comes to best coding style and stuff like that).

Bug still occurs using original steps to reproduce.

this patch is good, but it's better to provide more context to ease the review.
