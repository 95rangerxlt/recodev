Current record/stop UI is rather primitive and we can do better. AFAIK, there were no design decisions made yet, so feel free to chime in.

Er, that commit had the wrong bug number!
Yeah, sorry, that commit should have been labeled as bug 828039. I've backed it out and re-landed it with the right bug number.

Change recording UI and behavior

So I was playing with better recording UI and accidentally refactored everything. In this patch:

1. New recording UI that is similar to other profiles. There's only one button to start/stop profiling. I removed the functionality to create profiles without starting them because a) it was kinda useless and b) it simplified code a lot (this patch deletes more code than it adds). You can still use console API to run multiple profiles in parallel but now they won't appear in the UI until they're completed.
2. Changed GCLI commands to reflect changes in (1).
3. Refactored a bunch of code to remove unnecessary complexity and removed some tests that became obsolete because of (1).
4. (!!!) Got rid of JSMs. All profiler files are now normal RequireJS files. It looks so much better.

Since I touched some code outside of the profiler I'm asking multiple people for reviews.

Joe: GCLI changes (2);
Dave: RequireJS transition (4);
Rob and/or Panos: everything else.

Thanks!
needs more reviewers.

I think just profile.target would work.

> I think just profile.target would work.

..where profile is the thing returned when you do this.push([box], ...). But I guess you're not really using that anywhere, so in this particular case it'd be more like this.getItemByProfile(profile).target, which is a mouthful. Meh, you decide what you like.

Require stuff looks fine, although I'm pretty surprised that require isn't working for you in mochitests, we already use it all over the place.

Added new icon. Carrying over dcamp's r+. Gonna land this patch since try push was successful.
