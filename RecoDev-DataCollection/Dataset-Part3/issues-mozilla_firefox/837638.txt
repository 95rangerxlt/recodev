I don't understand - notifications are transient by default, and AFAIK this is the only way to make them not so.

These notifications' 'persistence' is never decreased. We don't call removeTransientNotifications for them.
Oh, I see. That's kind of a confusing thing to rely on (easy to forget that there are multiple notificationboxes), but I guess that's fine...
