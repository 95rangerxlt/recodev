While we are sticking with the worker model, the 'cookie' attribute available to workers should be replaced with a port-based implementation.  Marking as "major" as this is an API change and probably needs to be coordinated with our partners.

Fixed and pushed to github.  Note amigo (via email) and motown (via grep) aren't using the worker 'cookie' property so I just nuked it instead of deprecating it.
