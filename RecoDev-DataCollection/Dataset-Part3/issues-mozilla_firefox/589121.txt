In Windows Classic Style, 
Hovering menuitem shows black on blue instead of white on blue.

Text color should be white.

This problem looks like Bug 571871.

Are we supporting the menubutton on Windows Classic?

I think we should. At least the draw-in-titebar stuff should already work in the classic theme (when the patch is checked in again). And disabling the button when the user switches the theme seems more difficult than just supporting it.

Yes. This bug affects more than classic, though.
The patch in bug 589163 fixes this for some items.

This looks like it will slow down interaction with every menu or menuitem in the window... not cool.

appmenuPrimaryPane isn't a split menuitem. Setting the split-menuitem class there is not cool ;-)

Thanks for looking into this, but I already have a pretty simple patch, just need to test it.
Ok, thanks Dao! :)

Why is the -moz-padding-end removal OK?
Why do we need to specify these styles at all anyways? Can the answer to that be in a comment?

It was there to align the keyboard shortcuts. They're gone, so it's not needed anymore, and the selector doesn't actually match anything anymore.
