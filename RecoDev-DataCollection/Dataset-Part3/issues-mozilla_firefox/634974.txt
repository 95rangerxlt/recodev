patch v1

I get the warning message:

JavaScript strict warning: chrome://browser/content/tabview.js, line 3274: anonymous function does not always return a value

A patch is attached. If I'm not mistaken the return is ignored anyway. I guess the idea was to exit from the each-loop, but the implementation of each in iQ seems to have no way to do this.

(this was added in bug 600645)

No real risk and no functional change, but it makes debug builds output less useless warnings and by that real problems easier to find.
