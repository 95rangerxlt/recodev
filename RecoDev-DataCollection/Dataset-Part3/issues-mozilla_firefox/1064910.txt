Try push is almost completely green, so requesting review (updater xpcshell test failures and gaia python integration test suite failures are handled in separate bugs):

Have you tried running webapprt chrome tests? "./mach webapprt-test-chrome"

We expect some tests to break that aren't run automatically on try or m-c. In this case, the difference seems to be that we use mach locally and mozharness on our test servers. We knew some breakage was likely and will fix it as it comes up. Thanks for the heads up!

No worries, the tests aren't run automatically yet (they're run automatically in a separate tree: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Cedar).
