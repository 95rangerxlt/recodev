STR:
 1. Start typing something in the search bar.
 2. Inspect the dropdown that appears.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
* There's a dark background on the suggested search terms & the search engine list.
* In contrast, there's a light background on the other panels -- the headers w/ name of current search engine, "Search for [...] with:", and the "Change Search Settings" at the bottom.
* So this creates a weird alternating stripey-looking pattern.

Before the switch to GTK3, this dropdown had all basically the same background color (with maybe a subtle variation).

I'm using Nightly 42.0a1 (2015-07-24) with Ubuntu 15.04 & gnome-shell.

*** Bug 1187414 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Even on GTK2 the colors on a non-dark theme are grey vs. white, so it doesn't really surprise me as much that on a dark theme they would be black vs. white. Anyhow, I'm investigating how we style this and if/how we can do better (or if gtk3 is giving us the wrong thing for a system color, or something).
Florian, looks like we hardcode the header colors, and the tree is left themed. Can we use theme colors for the headers as well?

There was a WIP for this in bug 1106569. Unfortunately, it didn't land because it also attempted to do a larger refactoring (css de-duplication) at a time when we were still uplifting plenty of searchbox patches.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The code changes look reasonable. I don't have access to my Linux machine right now to test, but I assume you made it look either like attachment 8638634, or like something seeming more native. A screenshot would be nice.

Is the reason for using a hardcoded color here (rather than a value from the theme, like for example threedlightshadow, as the WIP did in bug 1106569) that you need this color to match the color in the png file used for the background image of .searchbar-engine-one-off-item ?

That, and they don't fit with the menu colour in the theme(s) I tried. In the default Ubuntu theme, for instance, all of the ThreeD*Shadow colours are far too light.

Screenshots attached.
