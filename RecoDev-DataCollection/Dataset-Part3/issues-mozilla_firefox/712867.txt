Using Windows 7:

1. Set the Windows color scheme to "High Contrast Black"
2. Set devtools.editor.component to "orion"
3. Open Scratchpad
4. Type some text

Scratchpad shows the text as white on white (or white on light blue when the line is selected).

Is that still true in Firefox Aurora 11 (or Firefox Nightly)?
Problem also occurs in 12.0a1 (2011-12-23) on Windows 7.

Looks fine to me.

Did you test the patch on Windows 7 with the High Contrast Black color scheme?
