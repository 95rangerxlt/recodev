STR:

I start a simulator using Web IDE, select the "Browser" app from the runtime apps menu on the left, and the browser icon and app name are displayed to show that's the active app. Then I press pause to debug.

I close the simulator, but before I open a new one, I'd expect the last used app to be "deactivated". Instead it remains as it was before.

If I then start another simulator the menu looks as if I had already selected the app from the menu, but I haven't. When I actually select it, it does launch the app in the simulator, but it feels weird to "reselect" it.

I understand this makes sense when editing an app for which we have the source code (you don't want to be selecting it everytime you change to a different runtime), but for the other apps this feels a bit weird.

Sigh, so close! :)

This is a good fix for now to correct the behavior.  In bug 1055666, I proposed preserving the selected project and re-open it on connect, which may save some steps in the process, so we may undo this in the future.
