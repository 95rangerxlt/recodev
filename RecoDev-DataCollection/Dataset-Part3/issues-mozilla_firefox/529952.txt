I keep finding hundreds of the following errors in the error console and finally narrowed it down to Gmail.  There are many STR but the easiest is to just click the compose link to start composing a new email.  Usually one error pops up when you click the link but if you click it a second time, a dozen or so of the same errors appear.

Error: Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsISupports.QueryInterface]
Source file: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 6459

I'm using the following build and I don't know when this started
Build: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091118 Minefield/3.7a1pre

It's not just Gmail.  You can reproduce this on some websites having DHTML drop-down menus.  When you hover over the menu and it appears, you get the exception.  When you leave the menu and it disappears, you get the exception.

Some example sites:
1. http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx
2. http://www.techpowerup.com/
3. https://signin.optimum.net/signin?referer=http://www.optimum.net%2FWiFi%2FAuthentication

Please change platform to ALL ALL
similiar (fixed) report from the past: Bug 459790

test case: Examples that trigger the exception (DHTML menus)

Here is an example taken from: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/jimmenu/index.htm

Simply unzip the file and launch either example.htm, example2.htm or example3.htm.  As you mouse-over the menus, you will see the exceptions being reported to Error Console.

different error, but i think is the same as bug 530266, so blocking on that one.
Gavin said he'd have a patch for this; not blocking, but poke me on IRC for a quick approval.

onStateChange can be called with a non-nsIChannel nsIRequest. We don't particularly care about updating the crash report URL in those cases.

r=me, thanks!

I'd vote for CRITICAL in importance. This took me a whale of a time to track down today during developing a FF add-on, because I (obviously) thought it's my code which is at fault. But this turned out to be wrong...I reverted to a 20091113 build and everything is great. So since Kurt reported this on 19 Nov, it must have been broken in the short period of 13th-19th Nov.

I've noticed this error on:
Build id : Mozilla/5.0 (Android;Linux armv7l;rv:7.0a1)Gecko/20110601
Firefox/7.0a1 Fennec/7.0a1
Device: LG Optimus 2X
OS: Android 2.2

Is it related to this bug?
Also I have some steps to reproduce the error from above:
1. Open Fennec App
2. Go to http://random.pavlov.net/silent.ogg
3. Long tap on video and tap Play
4. Long tap on video and tap Pause

After step 4 I've noticed that the error appears in console error twice.
