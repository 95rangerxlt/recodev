We're not going to have time to do import of users' toolbar config with our
auto-migration wizard so the next best thing is to make an educated guess. For
windows this means adding the Go button. That should get the overwhelming
majority of migrating users one step closer to their expected configuration.

Latest Sweetlou build:  When the toolbar is configured to display icons only the
"Go" icon is followed by the word "Go".  When Icons and text are selected the
text is under all buttons other than "Go", which is to the right.
Well if we're trying to emulate the default config on windows surely Bug 216292
applies and for that matter adding the mail button?
It's not just on Windows -- I see this on Linux too.  While minor, it's pretty
annoying to start a new build and find a new blue icon the middle of your
toolbar!  If you've already customized it, it looks bad.
Sorry, of course it's green, not blue!
we can also assume that the user doesn't have a search bar, but please don't
remove that too!

however stupid most ie users may be, i've never actually seen any of them use
this 'go button' you speak of.

why clutter the toolbar?
