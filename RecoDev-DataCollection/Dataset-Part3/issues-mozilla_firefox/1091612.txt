This test verifies that a network request can be cloned, edited and resent in the network monitor. Everything works properly, except the fact that when the new request is created [0], the actor id for that request doesn't correspond to the one in the "networkEvent" and "networkEventUpdate" packets sent afterwards over the protocol. This makes it impossible for the frontend to know whether or not this new network request is the one that we cloned, edited and resent beforehand.
