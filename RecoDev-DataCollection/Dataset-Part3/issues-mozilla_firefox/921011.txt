Not having an nsIBrowserDOMWindow implementation is actually causing a user visible bug: links clicked in detached chat windows open in a new browser window.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Get a SocialAPI chat window with a link in its content. (Eg. type 'http://mozilla.org' in the text box of a Talkilla conversation and send it.)
2. Detach the floating chat window to a new window.
3. Click the link.

Expected result:
The link opens in a tab in an existing browser window.

Actual result:
A new browser window is opened.

Simplifying the summary, as comment 1 here shows why we need a nsIBrowserDOMWindow implementation.

Patch

I just answered on IRC some questions from Shane about this patch, so I'm pasting it here in case Felipe has the same questions:
* mixedpuppy: [â€¦] why the removal of content?
* flo: see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910288#c4 comments 4 to 6
* flo: basically the "content" getter was a quick hack because I was too lazy to implement the real thing at the time (it didn't seem required back then)
* flo: and comment 0 where I said "I defined a 'content' getter to make them work (this seemed easier than getting the 'content' property we get from C++ to return the right value -- that would likely involve implementing nsIBrowserDOMWindow)."

* mixedpuppy: is "isTabContentWindow" correct?  from the name alone, I would assume that it should be true in a tabbed browser window
* flo: no, this is a method that needs to return true if the current XUL window is the window holding the tab for the given DOM (content) window.
* flo: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/interfaces/base/nsIBrowserDOMWindow.idl#89 says:
"whether the window [given as a parameter] is the main content window for any currently open tab in this toplevel browser window."
