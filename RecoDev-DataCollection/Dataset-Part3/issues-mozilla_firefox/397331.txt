Why don't make it native again for Windows XP and earlier? For Vista your patch looks good. IIRC it is now possible (or it will possible in near future) to make OS specific CSS.

Dao: what do you think of having the drop marker be inside of the text field, similar to the star?  It would have a white background normally but we would probably want it to pick up a button affordance on hover similar to IE7.  I sort of remember seeing this either mocked up or implemented at some point.

This would make the interface visually simpler, and create symmetry between the location bar and the search bar.
Not sure what IE7 does, but your description sounds like attachment 295861 from above :)
>sounds like attachment 295861 [details] from above :)

Yep, what do you think of that as the initial state, and for the hover state we go with the toolbox styling, but perhaps inside of the location bar instead of caped on the end?

I think that's another valid approach. Not sure which one I like best, though.

I had a chance to talk to beltzner about this.  We both like the surface of the button matching the search engine button and the site button (using toolbox), but we think it will look better if hover state expands to fill the location bar, like the first proposal.

Mockup of a combination of option 1 and 4

Here is the style that beltzner and I thought would look right, and also give us a visual simplicity win.
Alright.

Seems like this shifts the dropmarker on hover at times. New patch coming later today.

What's your plan for gnomestripe and pinstripe here? We should remove the toolkit rules together, if possible.
Gnomestripe's autocomplete.css is now using a native widget (bug 405210). We should probably have a look at pinstripe once the new theme has landed.
>We should probably have a look at pinstripe once the new theme has landed.

The current approach in proto of placing the drop marker inside of the field with no hover effect seems to fit nicely with platform conventions on OS X.

But does it fit better than |-moz-appearance: menulist-button|, generally and for all apps using autocomplete?

By all apps do you mean all apps that have autocomplete on OS X, or all apps across all platforms?  If you mean autocomplete on OS X, I actually don't know of an instance of this type of drop down control in a text field.  For instance, Safari doesn't have one.
I mean on OS X, as pinstripe isn't meant to be used on other platforms.
>I mean on OS X, as pinstripe isn't meant to be used on other platforms.

Without any similar widgets in other apps to compare to, we can't really match platform conventions.  But I think the current approach of an arrow inside of the field with no hover state feels like other text field buttons in OS X, like the magnifying glass.  For instance, in Vista the magnifying glass turns into a button on hover.

Here's what we can do for gnomestripe :)
|-moz-appearance: menulist-button| is already part of dropmarker.css.
