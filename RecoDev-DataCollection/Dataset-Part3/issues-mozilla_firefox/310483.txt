Since trunk builds from 20050928 if I open a couple of tabs and switch between
them I get a "blank" page. Refreshing will not "repaint" the page and I have to
restart. I use Fedora Core 4 and a screenshot of the problem can be seen here.

Do you see this when you start firefox with ./firefox safe-mode? (firefox and
firefox-bin must not be running when you start.)
I suffer from this problem and can confirm it still happens under safe-mode. I
first noticed this on the 27th and I update daily.

I am using latest nightly under Linux.

As Will has said this also happens in safe mode. Also, I'm glad it's not just
me, thanks for confirming Will. 
Anything else I can try then please let me know.

Steve.
Sounds a bit the same as bug 281709.
Could be a regression from bug 281709.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20050929
Firefox/1.6a1 ID:2005092922

Could not reproduce this in Windows.
dbaron backed bug 281709 out of the trunk today, marking this bug as FIXED, as I
can no longer reproduce it.
Indeed, just updated to - Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9a1)
Gecko/20051001 Firefox/1.6a1 ID:2005100104 - and all is well! :)
