Filed a bug with Apple, radar 6766451.
Apple says they are aware of the issue and it is being investigated.
I have seen the issue surface in other apps I installed on that machine as well, so it is not just our app.

Screenshot of finder window using latest seed

I just installed the latest seed and this is what the finder window looks like now, so the bug now manifests itself in a different way.
This issue has been resolved in the latest seed (10A380), so resolving this bug fixed.
