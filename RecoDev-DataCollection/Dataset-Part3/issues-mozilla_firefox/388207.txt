Back when I first noticed that although bug 346312 removed the way that the error.message entity ("There was an error processing this feed. It's our fault. :-( You can still subscribe to the feed if you know what it is. For reference, the error was:") was shown, it didn't remove the entity or its inclusion in the page, I thought that was only a problem in that as http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla1.8/search?string=error.message shows we made a whole lot of localizers translate a string with a frownie even though it wouldn't ever be seen. But, as he is wont to do, timeless noticed that you can actually see it quite easily, in feeds where there was absolutely no error.

STR:
1. Load http://www.mozilla.org/news.html
2. In the View menu, select Page Style -> No Style
3. Click the feed icon in the address bar
