Broke on Linux too. Can someone change this to all?
Some extra bits got accidentally checked in with the fix for bug 216899, backing them out fixes this.

backout extra bits from bug 216899
*** Bug 340832 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
So I guess the patch can be checked in without a review, since that code was checked in accidently anyway?
Ah sorry, Brett checked the patch for bug 216899 in, so he probably caused this hiccup.
This was fixed by landing bug 335291 which is where the accidental bits came from.
