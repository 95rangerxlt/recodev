Steps to reproduce:

Load the webpage included in the attached zip
Open Developer Tools
Go to the Debugger tab
Reload the page



Actual results:

The sourcemap (batch.js.map) was request 196 times.


Expected results:

The sourcemap should have been requested once.

I have noticed that this seems to be related to the complexity of the JS file being mapped. If you delete half of batch.js the number of requests that are made drops significantly.

There is this recent bug about sourceMap too: bug 1084534.
Thanks for the testcase!

I can reproduce using current Nightly on OS X and couldn't find existing bugs about this.
And in FF33 or older?
Same in Firefox 33. Unless there's any indication it's a regression, I wouldn't bother testing older versions.
Seems like we are _always_ bypassing our cached source map requests inside `ThreadSources.prototype.sourceMap` (or, never checking the cache, only inserting into it)

Yeah, we definitely weren't doing this: "if we already have such a promise extant, return that."

The rest of the patch is just making a crappy test better.

How come you are not using tabClient.reload() instead?

Because reload doesn't take a callback :/
