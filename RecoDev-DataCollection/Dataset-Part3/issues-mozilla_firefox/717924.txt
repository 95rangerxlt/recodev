Currently, the HTML tree view is below the page inspector toolbar. We want to move this above the (inspector) toolbar to better isolate this view from the page-centric tools.

We may want to file a separate bug to split it out of the registerTools mechanism used by the Inspector as these tools should be specifically for (nodecentric) tools that show up in the node sidebar.

   openDocked: function TP_openDocked()
   {
     let treeBox = null;
-    let toolbar = this.IUI.toolbar.nextSibling; // Addons bar, typically
-    let toolbarParent =

     treeBox = this.document.createElement("vbox");
     treeBox.id = "inspector-tree-box";
     treeBox.state = "open"; // for the registerTools API.

we should probably lose this comment since we're not going to be going through registerTools anymore.
neat.

I don't think that's the styling we want on the splitter though.

Either what we have on the Web Console or a hidden splitter like we have on the Style sidebar.

nit: indenting's a bit weird here. Should be lined up under the "i" in id.

in gnomestripe:
+/* Highlighter toolbar - HTML Tree */
+
+#inspector-tree-splitter {
+  -moz-appearance: none;
+  height: 4px;
+  border-top: 1px solid hsla(210,8%,5%,.45);
+  background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, hsl(210,11%,36%), hsl(210,11%,18%));
+}

no border-bottom?

from gnomestripe/inspector.css:

 
 body {
   margin: 0;
   overflow: auto;
   font-family: Lucida Grande, sans-serif;
   font-size: 11px;
-  border-top: 1px solid #BBB9BA;
+  padding-top: 5px;

why this change? Does the padding here accomodate all of the splitter?

Seems ok, r+ with the indentation fixed.

No. Do you think we need one?

Without that, immediately after the splitter we see the doctype, stuck to the splitter. It's weird.

Possibly. I'd defer to shorlander and co. for that one.

This should have a height of 1px similarly to devtools-side-splitter being 1px wide.

I also noticed that the toolbar has a bogus bottom border, although not caused by this patch.

Why is there a newer patch attached while the review request flag remains on this one?

It's what I did at first, but that looks too weird.
We need a clear separation between the content and the panel here.

Can you be more specific?

> Why is there a newer patch attached while the review request flag remains on this one?

Sorry about that. The only difference is the addition of a border-bottom to the #inspector-tree-splitter

bottom border

Why exactly would this be an issue here but not for devtools-side-splitter?

The devtools-side-splitter doesn't cut any content. The inspector-tree-splitter does.

I am not strongly against having a 1px splitter though.
Stephen, can you please tell us what we should do here?
Stephen said 1px.
