PlacesUtils uses cached root ids.

don't cache roots

so, this fixes part of it, but there's still an odd ui bit not working:

if i select a folder, set it as btf, and then with that folder still selected immediately open the edit menu again, the "set as btf" menu item is still enabled. it should be disabled.

if i select a different folder, and then re-select the new btf, and open "edit", the menu is disabled as it should be.
So, all the values seem to get set right (such as the new toolbar folder id). But it seems like the menu under Edit is only rebuilt everytime a different bookmark or a bookmark folder is clicked (but I might be wrong). Kind of stuck... any suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thanks!

As a hack you could call goUpdate("whatever_the_command_name_is"); when setting the toolbar folder. This issue (places commands only updated after "select" event) also breaks undo/redo state though wrt. to all commands so I would rather fix that separately.

Also, the bookmarks & places ids should still be cached.
mm... I can't seem to reproduce this part of the fix (even though I should make fix it so that bookmarks & places ids should be cached). Was there some change?

Here's the proposed patch. Only concern I have has to do with undo/redo.
Currently, I set the oldFolderId when the toolbar folder is changed and calling undo after changing the toolbar folder seems to do everything correctly. But not sure if there are any cases where this wouldn't work.

Mano, i don't understand the issue here. is there a bug for what you're referring to?

in favor of adding a setter for the toolbar to PlacesUtils, and updating the value from the transaction?

Neil filed a bug on this at some point, basically command-updating is only triggered when a "select" event fired (on the tree) while not all commands trigger selection.

Er? the bookmarks & places roots are read-only.

er, sorry i was thinking about how to avoid getting the toolbar direct from the bookmarks service every time. doing as i described would allow us to continue caching it. but yes, the other roots should still be cached.

now that utils.toolbarFolder is not cached, there's no need for this line anymore. in any case, you'd want to fix the initial setting of _oldFolderId instead of doing this.

does undoTransaction also need to update the command?

per mano's comment, these can be cached, so no need for these changes.
Waiting until bug#376004 is finished.

In response to this comment, I removed the goUpdateCommand from the last patch so it can be dealt separately.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
