The file browser/themes/shared/devtools/webconsole.inc.css has several lines like...
  flex: 0 0 auto;
...which bug 1032922 is renaming to...
  flex: 0 0 main-size;
because the "flex-basis:auto" keyword has been renamed to "main-size" in the spec.

These lines should really be using the "flex:none" keyword, because it's...
 (1) more human-readable ("don't flex")
 (2) more concise
 (3) more future-proof, since it's one of the "Common Values of flex" (read as "recommended ways to specify flex") listed at http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-flexbox/#flex-common

Filing this bug on doing that switch to "flex:none", as suggested in bug 1032922 comment 20.
