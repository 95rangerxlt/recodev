At the page in the URL there is a listbox (quite large) that keeps creating and
destroying scrollbar continuously, and thus makes reading of the contents quite
hard.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page at
http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackId=aa9ee66e-102e-492b-adc9-7e90e808cd2d
2. Scroll down. Enjoy (?) the flashing listbox 
Actual Results:  
Flashing scrollbar in the listbox

Expected Results:  
Rock-steady listbox, with or without scrollbar.
