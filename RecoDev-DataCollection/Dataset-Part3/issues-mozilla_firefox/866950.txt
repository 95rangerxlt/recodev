Fallout from bug 855914.

Error messages in files loaded through jetpack's loader are not showing source when clicking on the location.

e.g., [18:35:26.937] ReferenceError: console is not defined @ 
                resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> 
                resource:///modules/devtools/framework/toolbox.js:795

How is this error logged? console.error() call or is it an nsIScriptError? What is the message source?
Looks like an nsIScriptError to me. Here is how we treat these URLs in the debugger frontend:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-panes.js#104
Investigated the problem. The |sourceName| holds " -> ". It seems we need to split on that, and always use the last item. Thanks Panos for the pointer to that code.
This is probably not a regression. The Web/Browser Console never handled script errors with multiple sourceNames joined together with " -> ".
