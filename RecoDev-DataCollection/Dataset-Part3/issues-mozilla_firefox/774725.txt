Patch

I tried on Mac but didn't see the toolbar changing in height when the Social API was enabled/disabled.

The social.manifest.motown is not available in Firefox 17.0 (beta 6), but instead there is social.manifest.facebook. Changing it's value doesn't trigger the reported issue. Neither does manually adding a new preference entry for social.manifest.motown and setting the value mentioned in bug description.

Was the removal of social.manifest.motown preference intended?
The STR from comment 0 aren't relevant to current builds where there is already a social provider built-in (social.manifest.* has a default value).

The main idea here is to ensure that enabling social (e.g. Facebook) doesn't change the toolbar height. We fixed one instance of that in this bug, but have some other known issues: bug 811835 and bug 812488.
Marking this bug verified for Firefox 17, based on comment #6 and comment #7 (issue is not reproducible by enabling Facebook Social).
