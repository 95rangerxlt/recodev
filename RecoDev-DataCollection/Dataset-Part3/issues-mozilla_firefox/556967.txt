Full Glass / UI transparency effect is not working with Windows Vista at all.

The version of Minefield is the latest available (3.7a-pre4). I am not using any Vista UI hacks. The stable version of Firefox (3.5.8) I was using earlier was fully uninstalled before installing this version.

No theme is installed, i.e. the default theme is in use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
No steps necessary.

Glass has been disabled in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/69e17a1b3034
Ah, so it was disabled in Pre-Alpha 4?
Yes.
I believe this was done since the implementation had several issues. Anyhow, should this bug be marked invalid?
@ Magne: Please do mark so. My apologies for raising this bug, in hindsight, as it is not really a bug at all.
This bug can track reverting http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/69e17a1b3034

Dao: Is there something on Aero that users can test? coz right now we can really not test anything since it is disabled. Can we not add an about:config option to turn it on/off so that we can continue filing bugs on Aero rather than waiting for that one bug 555182 to be resolved?
No, we can't easily add a pref for this, as it's pure CSS code that has been disabled.
Perhaps we can add that too? Or does that require re-compilation?
Just to add weight, being able to turn on / off glass would surely help us speed up the debugging process for this and bug 555182

Have created this using Dao's code from the patch for Aero glass. Have tried to keep it as accurate as I could.
