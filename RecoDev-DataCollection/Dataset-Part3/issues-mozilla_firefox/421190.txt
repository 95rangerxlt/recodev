patch v1: adds exception reporting

I've been thinking a bit about the fix for bug 376222.  The one downside to it is that exceptions that get thrown by progress listeners no longer get reported, so extension authors whose extensions aren't working because of such exceptions may have a hard time tracking them down.

Core Firefox developers could have a similar problem, since the patch suppresses exceptions for their progress listeners too.

It seems like this could be resolved by simply reporting the exceptions via Components.utils.reportError.  Here's a patch that does that.

Requesting approval for this useful low-risk improvement to a recent fix.
I was all set to mention that I had implied this in bug 376222 comment #0 - where I suspected it may be useful - but you have beaten me to it!

I have verified this fix with the pathological extension from bug 376222; And, as a real-life example, bug 421321 which had the right symptoms.
