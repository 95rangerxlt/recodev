Confirmed (I was standing behind the reporter at the time). It was a brand-new profile (as I was installing Bon Echo for him).

Enforce a minimum height for about dialog

This patch enforces a minimum height for the about dialog so the links aren't likely to be obscured. The links are likely to be obscured with a dpi of 75 without this patch. (layout.css.dpi)

Enforce a minimum height for about dialog

I don't see why this would get us in trouble anywhere else, but are we sure that height is enough to capture localized strings as well? Do we want to, at the same time, also maybe bring up the lines a little to keep them away from the bottom of the dialog?

About dialog on windows after patch

Hm, the extra space above the useragent doesn't look too good..

Remove redundancy

This cleans up the xul a bit and prevents the useragent box from being pegged to the bottom of the screen - the only thing that makes a minimum height look ugly.

I was seeing this problem on Linux with the 20060905 branch build - Friends & Contributors links needed to scroll up to about quarter height of the dialog to be clickable. This corresponds to being out of the faded region, but the position is hit and miss because it's hard to hit a moving target.

This changed in the 20060906 build (which has the patch from this bug) - the fade is now missing but I can't get any response from the link until it is moving.

Same bug/different one ?
People are still complaining of this issue. See http://screwedbydesign.com/images/about.png for a screenshot of the issue on Ryan's machine (where he cannot click the links until it scrolls). Supposedly, the gradient extends that far to cover the links, which is not fun at all. :(

<@mwu> sure, but I don't know if we want to shorten the gradient or make the minimum height bigger or some combo of both

Smaller footer image without useless invisible 8px at top

This is identical to the original footer gradient, except there isn't that extra 8px of invisible stuff at the top. Hopefully this extra 8px is enough..

r=me, please ask some affected people to test with this patch before requesting branch approval.

I tested two linux builds on the trunk:
  * hourly after the patch landed (FTP timestamp 08-Sep-2006 00:10 PDT)
  * 20060907 nightly 

In the hourly I can click on the Friends/Contributor links immediately, so the fix works. The nightly is a consistency check - I saw the same problem as observed on the branch.
