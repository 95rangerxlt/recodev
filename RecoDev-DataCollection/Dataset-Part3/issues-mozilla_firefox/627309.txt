Could you please post some short description of what the problem was here for mere mortals like me?  :-)  Thanks!
Sure.
Bug 578422 added a mask to the forward button in lwtheme mode so that it doesn't extend under the (now transparent) round back button. However, this mask was assuming LTR orientation, so it was cutting out the circle shape on the wrong side in RTL mode (see attachment 50537). Instead of creating another mask for the RTL case, I chose to flip the whole toolbarbutton using -moz-transform, so that the mask was flipped, too. The other changes in the patch were to unflip the untransformed button's shape and icon so that it doesn't get double-flipped.

Sorry, usually I'm the one who gets annoyed when people post insufficient bug descriptions...
Thanks a lot for your explanation, Markus!  I just want to keep an eye on what's happening in the RTL land because I'll soon start testing Persian builds... :-)
