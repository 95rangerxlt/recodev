Just realized that multiple about window's can be opened and they can conflict with one another when checking for updates or downloading an update.

Really? I tried opening additional about windows, but the "About Minefield" menuitem just brought focus back to the original about window. I tested this on Windows 7 and OSX.

Ah, that does it on Windows. However, on Linux and OSX selecting the menuitem still brings focus back to the original about window.

Should we just replicate this behavior on Windows? I don't think it makes much sense for multiple about windows to exist, and that would solve the problem of multiple about windows checking for updates.

Yes.

I'm not sure if this is a hacky fix, but it fixes the problem.

Bouncing this over to gavin, this this code was just changed (after much discussion) in bug 417733.

But my $0.02 here is that we should just take this patch. It's just an About window, so it's hard for me to get too worked up about how it should behave.
