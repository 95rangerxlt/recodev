It's supposed to be something like this:

I don't think so. Bug 613714 was originally supposed to be for switching from the blur to dimming. It was decided to land the removal of the slow effects for beta 8, and work on the styling later. There doesn't seem to be another bug for that yet, so I guess this one will do.
Great! I also confirm this as an issue, then.
Can't there just be an opacity rule added to the css?  Are SVG effects really
necessary to make the dim non-opaque?

I read from the original bug that the *desaturation* was being removed, not the
*opacity*, necessarily.  At least that's what I gathered from bug 613714
comment 54 - 57.

If it stays like this for final, along with the imho questionable design
decision of making the alerts look as if they are "from the webpage" (but
obviously look nothing like other elements on the page, the browser, or etc.
and are completely unchangeable), I anticipate a lot of confused and annoyed
comments from many of the people I've converted to Firefox.  Alas.

Ugh. It hurts me to block on this. We could in theory ship b8 without it, but it would be a visible problem and it's a one line CSS fix.

Unfortunately, there are no midair collision warnings if the refresh button is used. It is a Bugzilla or Firefox bug. It's better to use the "Bug 619057" link in the title of the bug, so that the fields, like "blocking", are updated properly. The refresh button does not update the fields.
