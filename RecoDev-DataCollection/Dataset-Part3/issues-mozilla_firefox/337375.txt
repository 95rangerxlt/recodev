The problem is the null parameter to openWindow in _openWindowWithState. See bug 277798 comment #6. Replacing the null with an empty nsISupportsString fixes the issue:

var argString = Cc["@mozilla.org/supports-string;1"].createInstance(Ci.nsISupportsString);
argString.data = "";
....openWindow(..., argString);

applies the described fix

here's a patch for the fix as simon described it. i can't reproduce the problem on a mac, so i'll get a windows build going and try there.
I'm having the exact same problem.  However, the second window also causes Windows to refuse to show the taskbar unless you press CTRL+ESC or the winkey (I have my taskbar on auto-hide).  As soon as I close the broken second window, the taskbar reappears correctly when I move my mouse to that side of the screen.
