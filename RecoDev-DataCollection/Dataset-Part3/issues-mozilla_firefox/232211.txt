Can you try and reproduce this with a more recent build and see if you still get
the same problem? Make sure you use a clean profile to test. Here are the newer
builds:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/nightly/latest-trunk/MozillaFirebird-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz

Please let us know if the problem is gone or still occurs using these builds and
a clean profile.
I have the exact same problem. I am using:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040211 Firefox/0.8

I build this just a few hours ago, and i have had this problem ever since 0.7,
eventhough it was not as noticible because i was on a slow connection, and
thought it was normal.

now it is really starting to annoy me.

Note: This also happens on Windows, and others.
I notice that the scrollbar is very jumpy during loading a long page, but it is
not at a complete standstill.  

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040613 Firefox/0.8.0+
I have this problem with 0.10. Scroll bar only scrolls if you click about 1 or 2
cm to the right of the browser window, rather than on the actual bar.
Same problem with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) 
Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 on Windows XP Pro SP2.
looks like this bug is Fixed, i use 1.0 for some time now and its okay.
