Can you make the initialization of UserAgentOverrides conditional on the presence of general.useragent.override.* prefs, rather than commenting them out like that?

How did you determine that this was fixed?

Where? In nsBrowserGlue? In the jsm? Initializing the module without any prefs set is a reasonable thing to do, since the module will monitor the pref branch for live modifications. I just thought we'd rather avoid the tiny overhead, but other consumers might decide differently.

I logged in with a dummy AOL mail account.

I meant in nsBrowserGlue. I don't think we need to support live modifications to these prefs at all, really.

This override isn't the last one anymore, so I'm simply removing the pref and leaving the initialization alone.
