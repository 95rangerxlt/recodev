Introduce a pref that will be used to develop the animation-inspector UI v3 (bug 1153271) while keeping the current UI as is.
I doubt that the new UI will be fully functional after one bug fix, so this pref would help smooth out the transition.

Introduce a pref that will be used to develop the animation-inspector UI v3 (bug 1153271) while keeping the current UI as is.
I doubt that the new UI will be fully functional after one bug fix, so this pref would help smooth out the transition.
The patch I'll attach here really just adds a pref to firefox.js, something along the lines of newUI=true/false.

The strategy here is that the new UI we want to put in place in bug 1153271 is sufficiently different from the current one that we can't migrate from one to the other, it has to be a switch over at some stage.

This pref will make it possible to both:
- develop the new UI hidden, allowing people to still use the current one, and try out the few bits of the new UI that will land if they want to
- create tests for the new UI, while making sure the existing ones still work.

Yes makes sense to me.
