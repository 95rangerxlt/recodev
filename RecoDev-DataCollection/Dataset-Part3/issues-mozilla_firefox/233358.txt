For users of mice with with a scroll wheel, Firebird seems to be having a
problem.   For some reason when you attempt to scroll on a page by moving the

up or down. This seems to be a regression from 4/2/04  (maybe a few days earlier).

upgrade, and I simply have to create a new profile. Annoying? Oh yes.
will try with a new profile; thanks for the advice.
