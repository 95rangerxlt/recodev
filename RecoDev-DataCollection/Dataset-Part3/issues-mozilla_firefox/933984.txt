JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/newtab/newTab.js, line 454: this._mutationObserver is undefined

I think this is actually
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/ad2a5a4f53ec/browser/base/content/newtab/page.js#l149
which was added in bug 910036.

Fuzzing hits this frequently, but I don't have a reproducible testcase.

Yes, I'm seeing that, too.  (Is there a bug on JS errors not reporting correct file names and line numbers for preprocessed files?  I would really like to fix that.)

This is easy to reproduce.  Just set browser.newtabpage.enabled to false, restart, open a new tab, and then close it.  The problem is that in _init, _mutationObserver is only defined if newtab is enabled, but on unload, _mutationObserver.disconnect() is unconditionally called.

An alternative to this patch would be to define _mutationObserver in init (no leading underscore), which is called even if newtab is disabled.  But I think this patch is better since _mutationObserver isn't needed if newtab is disabled.
