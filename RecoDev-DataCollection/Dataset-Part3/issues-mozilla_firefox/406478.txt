I think in nsPlacesTransactionsService.js
 we use both this.id and this._id.

I really wish we just did one, and I think this._id is the more common one.

We had bugs caused by mixing them up, and I think we even have a code clean bug about not doing this.id.

Can you use this._id instead?
the id is modified externally for nested transactions, so we should probably standardize on .id instead of ._id.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
