In customization mode the "Bookmarks toolbar items" is a bit buggy. First when you click on it its "movable image" the goes to the left. 

Then with the new animated behavior it takes a lot of place and put all the items far from their original places when you move it.

The default behavior should be that this item always takes only its text width.

Sounds like P3, but maybe P2 if this is a regression compared with the previous customization interface (which I suspect is not the case).
With the recent fixes to the bookmark toolbar items as well as the placeholder width calculation, is this fixed? I think so, but I'd like some confirmation if possible. Guillaume?
Yeap looks good. Only thing I can think of is that the icon doesn't look good when in the palette, but this isn't directly related.

Great. Filed bug 922834 for that issue, and I'll mark this as fixed in M9 (due to the likes of bug 879863 and bug 909729 being fixed then).
