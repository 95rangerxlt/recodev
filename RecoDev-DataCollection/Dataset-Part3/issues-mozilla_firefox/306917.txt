untill the last update it was possible to open pdf files. now not anymore. it is
quite anoying, as i need this feature a lot. i quite don't understand how a
browser, specially one that offers in general more than the microsoft explorer,
does not put more effort to solving this problem. martin bissig
As I see, this bug does found much attention, and yet the problem 
is very annoying and very common. Let me show you such examples 
coming from very prominent web page, General Electric home
appliances. Go to:

  http://www.monogram.com/literature.htm

and try to view or print or save any of the *.pfd files.
Every of these operations works perfectly file with the 
Internet Explorer. Java Console reports:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH) [nsIDOMLocation.href]"  nsresult: "0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///c:/ThH/_Download/Dispatcher.html :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 9"  data: no]


Numerous other web pages have such problems with Firefox, different 
Java Scripr errors might be reported. Go to: 

http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SPECPAGE&SKU=JS998SKSS&SITEID=GEA&TABID=4

Select the "Product Documentation" tab and try to print 
"Quick Specs" (also: works perfect with Internet Explorer,
which however opens a popup, ans asks for permision.)
Firefor simply opens a new empty tab. The URL is:

  http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/images/t07/0000001/r01986v-1.pdf

Java Script console says:

  Error: attachEvent is not defined
  Source File: http://www.geappliances.com/code/js/FY05_SEARCH_GE.js
  Line: 6

Now if you use "Alt Click" Firefox downloads a file called "Dispatcher.html"
with the content:

[...




<html><head><title></title></head>
<script>
//function loadMe(){
document.location.href="/ApplProducts/images/t07/0000001/r01986v-1.pdf";
//}
</script>
<body>
</body>
</html>

...]

In many situations than Firefox hangs for approx. half a minute 
(dead window update,) even of a fast 3GHz Dell system, which I 
use right now. best is to kill-off the tab or even the entire
browser.

With Adobe Acrobat 6.0.4, able to open .pdf files in web browser 1.0.7
