Reproducible on:
* Aurora 40.0a2 (2015-06-04)
* Nightly 41.0a1 (2015-06-07)

Affected platforms:
Ubuntu 14.04 (x64), Mac OS X 10.8.5 & 10.9.5, Windows 7 (x64)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox.
2. Toggle the Developer Tools and select "Performance".
3. Run the profiler for a few seconds on any page.
4. From the Waterfall section click on any marker available.
5. Click anywhere in the Sidebar displaying data for the selected marker.
6. Check the Browser Console.

Expected result:
There are no errors thrown in the Browser Console for this action.

Actual result:
* Clicking anywhere in the sidebar available for markers results in the following error thrown by marker-details.js:117:17:
> TypeError: el.getAttribute is not a function
* Nightly 41.0a1 (2015-06-07) is showing the same error, but thrown from a different line - marker-details.js:139:17:
> TypeError: el.getAttribute is not a function

Notes:
* This issue might be a regression, I'll follow up with a regression range as soon as possible.
