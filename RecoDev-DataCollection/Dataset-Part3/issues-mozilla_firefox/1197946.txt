Bug1197946.patch

One note - I realized not hiding the "Select runtime" on the right side would be strange if there is nothing to select (since there is no dropdown). What that should say is something like "No runtime selected" but that would require changing the label and I figured hiding it if there is no current runtime was the easiest fix.

Once we finally switch over, we can reword the label - thoughts?

Are you able to use display: none for this based on the .sidebar-layout class instead?  If not, this is okay.

Yeah I was going to at first, but then I figured in the pattern of previous logic on this codebase, we've generally used hidden=true instead of display: none (I assumed the latter was only for exceptional cases). I can change to display: none too but I also assume this entire fix is temporary if/when we do switch the layout. What do you think?
Okay, no worries then.  If we were revamping things, I'd probably use the class approach instead of hidden attribute, but you're right that the attribute matches the existing pattern.  Like you say, it's meant to be temporary, so either form is probably okay.
