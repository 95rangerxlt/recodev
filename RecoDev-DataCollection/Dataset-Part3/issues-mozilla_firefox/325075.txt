P.S. The source text of "chrome://global/locale/license.dtd" is as follows:

<!ENTITY license.part0     "is copyright">
<!ENTITY license.part1     "by its">
<!ENTITY license.contrib   "contributors">
<!ENTITY license.part2     "according to terms set out in the">
<!ENTITY license.part3     "document. All Rights Reserved.">
<!ENTITY license.credits   'For full Mozilla credits, type "about:credits" into the Location bar.'>

This was already fixed today by this checkin: http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?diff_mode=context&whitespace_mode=show&subdir=mozilla/toolkit/locales/en-US/chrome/global&command=DIFF_FRAMESET&file=license.dtd&rev1=1.3&rev2=1.4&root=/cvsroot

Well, we'll see when the next nightly comes out (no less than twelve hours from now I guess?)
- Bug is not present in "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060129 Firefox/1.5" build ID:2006012903
- I've been shown a fix which looks like it could have made the bug disappear.
- The fix is present on this build.

Conclusion: Bug is FIXED.
