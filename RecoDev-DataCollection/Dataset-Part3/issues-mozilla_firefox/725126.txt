I have not been able to reproduce this, but it looks like a case of us not spinning the loop is the places database (bug 721603). I will mark this one as depending on that and upload new builds once that bug is fixed.
Now that 721603 is fixed, I have uploaded new builds to

Armen, can you try them? Thanks.
Sure. Next week though.
We did the testing.
We can close this.
