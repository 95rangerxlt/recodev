The files in browser/chrome/browser/cookieviewer seem to be not used anymore.
Grepping for those filename all over the tree didn't return any xul file.
Those three files seemed to be replaced by browser/chrome/browser/preferences/permission.dtd and toolkit/chrome/cookie/*.
This applies for both branch and trunk.

I guess we could remove them, it will be less confusing for localizers

Want to prepare a patch? I can r+.
(you should be able to use "cvsdo remove" http://viper.haque.net/~timeless/redbean/cvsdo and "cvs diff -uN" to prepare a patch even if you don't have write access)
Created attachment 263361
Patch removing the files

Thanks Gavin, here's the patch
Checkin needed on the Trunk. thx
(Not checking this in, since it's not a CVS diff and, judging from that, you probably don't have a tree you tested this on. Either make a real CVS diff or someone will apply and test these changes later.)
I don't see why this needs testing, they're clearly no longer used (they were removed from the packaging manifests in bug 283595).
Removed the following files:
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/cookieviewer/CookieExceptions.dtd
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/cookieviewer/CookieViewer.dtd
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/cookieviewer/CookieViewer.properties
