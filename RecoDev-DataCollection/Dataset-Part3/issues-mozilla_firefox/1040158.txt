+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1029926 +++

Blair asked for some follow-up work to bug 1029926, which added the multiprocessCompatible flag to install.rdf:

In addition to supporting this flag in install.rdf, we'll also want a followup bug to let AMO override it. This will let us cover cases like:
* Add-on is multi-process compatible, but author didn't add multiprocessCompatible to install.rdf
* Add-on specifies multiprocessCompatible, but we find it's buggy and needs the shims afterall
* Something changes that makes an add-on that was once multi-process compatible now be broken and need shims

And, finally, we should have some telemetry added for this, so we know what impact it's having now and over time.

Needs both client side and AMO side work.
I can't see how this depends on bug 1083545
I'm splitting the telemetry piece of this off into bug 1128121

patch

This allows an update.rdf to override the multiprocessCompatible. It doesn't do this at install time since we don't always load the update.rdf then (perhaps we should). But whenever a daily update check happens the change will be applied and persisted. The format is simple, with no flag present in update.rdf no change happens. If the flag is set then its value overrides that of install.rdf.

Yea, have been thinking we should.
