For bug 766616, whenever there is a problem with the social provider and we present an error message, we need to be able to restart the whole social provider to recover from the error  (when the user clicks "Try Again").

(This might be related to bug 785920 but it's not quite the same thing as in that one it is the working reloading itself)

Shane suggested calling SocialProvider._terminate() and then ._activate(), and reloading the UI, which I tried but that didn't seem to work properly (but maybe I did something wrong).  I'll attach the patch

Patch

This is what I tried so far.  Shane or Mark, can any of you take a look at this bug?
Mark tested this more thoroughly and said that this patch actually works! Mark, could you also test if the reset-ui notification before _activate is necessary or if it can be removed?

I just tested and confirmed it is necessary, as we speculated over IRC
I think this bug is out of date now - we do have a full "restart" of the provider implemented.  Felipe, does that sound correct to you?
we do have reload
