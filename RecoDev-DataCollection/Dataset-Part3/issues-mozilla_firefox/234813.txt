Trying to build Firefox will get you in all kinds of nasty Makefile troubles lately.

Like this in mozilla/Makefile.in:

ifdef MOZ_PHOENIX
#xpfe/components/search depends on nsIBookmarksService.idl
#XXXBlake this winhooks path is a temp hack; toolkit shouldn't depend on browser
tier_50_dirs    += browser/components/bookmarks/public
browser/components/winhooks/public
endif

That's nice for Windows platforms but for the rest of us it's PITA. There seems
to be more of them. Not sure but I'll probably hit bug 233382 again.
