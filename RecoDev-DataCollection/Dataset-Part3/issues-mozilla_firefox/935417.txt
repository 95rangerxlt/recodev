When text wraps in the inspector rule-view's rules separator, it extends out of its container, as shown in the screenshot.

This is probably a simple fix (min-height instead of height, or something like this) in the rule-view.css file.

This is probably a simple fix (min-height instead of height, or something like this) in the rule-view.css file.
Actually, we could use this bug to fix another problem: notice the `ul, ol {margin: 0px}` rule.
The 0px value wraps to the next line jut because of the `netError.css:31` stylesheet link.
Since the stylesheet link is supposed to be aligned with the `ul, ol` selector part, the property/value pair below that shouldn't be impacted by it.

bug935417-rule-view-text-wrapping.patch

This patch fixes the 2 problems listed in the bug:

- rule view separators now extend downwards to contain all the text and if selectors get really long, there's also a word-wrapping: break-word property that'll make sure everything's visible without having to have a horizontal scrollbar.

- properties extend to the full available length of the line instead of being forced wrapped when they're next to a sheet link. 
This was due to the float:right property on the link, now fixed with a clear:right.

There's no additional tests in this patch since this is only CSS changes.
