Applying the CSS style "letter-spacing" to a an element such as DIV or P
displays only the first word in each line of text within that element.  The
other words can be revealed by highlighting them with the mouse.  On short pages
(which don't get a vertical scrollbar), this seems to occur only when the window
is not maximized.

On various sites, such as the one linked to in this bug report, scrolling with
the scroll bar or via keyboard keys will render the text properly, but scrolling
with the wheel of a wheel mouse will cause the rendering error.  Switching to
another tab or window and back also shows the rendering error.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new file, and copy&paste the following into it:
<html>
<body>
<div style="letter-spacing:.1em;">
<p>Test One</p>
<p>Test Two</p>
<p>Test Three</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
2. Save file, and open in Firefox.
Actual Results:  
What's displayed is:
test
test
test

Expected Results:  
What should display is:
test one
test two
test three

I've tried this in quirks mode and standards mode, as HTML and as XHTML, and I
continue to get the same visual error of all text after the first work disappearing.

Your testcase works for me (displays all six words) in:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040224 Firefox/0.8.0+

Could you please retest with a more recent build and report if that helps:

I'm sorry if it's just my misunderstanding of Firefox branching (and my bad
English), but is it normal that this bug is still present in Firefox 1.0PR
(en-EN) and Firefox 1.0RC1 (pl-PL)?
