Over in bug 1180587 we are removing all Sync "error bars" from the browser window. The only surfaced Sync error will be "needs reauthentication" and that will be surfaced in the hamburger menu. ReadingList uses the infobar, so is almost certainly going to be broken by this change. It seems unlikely ReadingList is going to come back. Should we just kill it? We can always get it back from hg.

I agree. Pocket has been successful at providing this class of feature, and so I think it's very unlikely we'd spend all the time and resources to get Reading List (and Sync) fully finished. Especially because we'd then have 2 almost-but-not-quite-the-same services, and that would be confusing for users.

That said, I don't feel like we ever can to closure on what to do with the Reading List feature that Android has long shipped. I guess ideally, presuming the above, that it should migrate to / be replaced by Pocket?

mfinkle might have an opinion here!
It's looking more and more like Reading List, across platforms, will never happen.

I understand wanting to keep the shipping code clean and maintainable, so I think you should move ahead with removing the Desktop RL code from the tree.

Mobile has more work to do if we decide to drop RL. We'll need to discuss how to migrate data. That should not block Desktop.

I've split these patches somewhat arbitrarily to help share the review lovin'. 

This patch removes browser/components/readinglist. Drew, you helped land alot of this, so helping to unland it seems a reasonable next step :)

Irakli, there are some references to the readinglist sidebar in the addon-sdk code. Could you have a quick look at this, or suggest someone else who could have a look?

Drew, you are also listed as a peer for the addon-sdk and I think I've waited long enough for :gozala - the patch is quite simple.
