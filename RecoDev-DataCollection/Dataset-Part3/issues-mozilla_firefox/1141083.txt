Now that the prototype is implemented, there have been a number of refinements suggested by Aislinn, for example:

- Keyboard navigation or hover onto the More Providers button should show the extra providers instead of suggestions. (And they don't get suggestions.  Clicking on one takes you to it.)
- Hitting down skips the first suggestion, but shouldn't.
- Make the dropdown arrow about half the height.

This bug is to decide what needs fixing (and fix it) before we send the prototype out for user testing.

Marking as 13 points, because of the unknown nature of the work, and the tendency of this kind of work to fill the space allotted to it.

And we're done polishing.  The latest version is at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2301433/SearchProvider/Firefox.latest.dmg

The set of changes I made to mozilla-central to get this prototype working (just for the record).
