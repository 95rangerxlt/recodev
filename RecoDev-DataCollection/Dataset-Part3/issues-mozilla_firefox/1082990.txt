protect more code with MOZ_ENABLE_PROFILER_SPS

Sorry for the breakage :(

This patch protects the include with MOZ_ENABLE_PROFILER_SPS
and then the bit of code that required the new include.

I tested this by rebuilding with MOZ_ENABLE_PROFILER_SPS both
enabled and disabled.

Sorry for the spam. Moving bugs to Firefox :: Developer Tools: Performance Tools (Profiler/Timeline).
