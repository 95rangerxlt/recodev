Good day,

replies in forums and composing webmail interface messages wonky. Not sent. FF3.6

I upgraded, only a version number or two to 3.6.

Composing a reply or new mail message (Earthlink webmail page) https://webmail.earthlink.net/wam/login.jsp?redirect=%2Fwam%2Fwamrss.jsp%3Fx%3D219930900%26redirect%3D%252Fwam%252Findex.jsp&x=-1275468590&x=-1692171327

... posting the message, 9 out of ten times, it is dumped. I now C+P before I send it. THe second or third time the mail does get sent.

On a forum that uses http://www.phpbb.com/ software, similar behavior. Rarely a reply posts the first time, but backspace will retrieve the actual reply that I have typed in. Once again, a second (or 3rd) tick of  Send/Submit will get the message moving properly.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.tick Reply button- either example
2.compose reply - either example
3.Forum reply: tick Send/Submit button -  window reverts to original reply page. My message is lost. Tick Backspace, my filled in reply reappears. Tic Send/Submit again, message is posted.

Earthlink web mail interface page. Tick Send/Submit button, for _either_ new composition _or_ a reply- message is forever lost. @nd or 3rd try it will post out properly.
Actual Results:  
x

Expected Results:  
x

I had none of the described difficulties with the most previous recent version (3. something) of FF.

I use Spybot Personal Firewall (pro) to block crap. And Flashblock.

Thank you

My own update:
I never considered add-ons

I had Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant 1.1 (somehow, d'oh) slipped into my browser. It isn't anything I need, don't know why I had d/led the M$Update. sheesh. It hadn't caused any problems until I upgraded to FF v3.6

I disabled the thing and all my troubles ended.
