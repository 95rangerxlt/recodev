Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a few tabs; close a few tabs.
2. Go to History > Recently Closed Tabs > and choose Open in Tabs.

Results: 
The first item in the list is loaded in the current tab, while the other items are opened in new tabs.

Expected results:
I would expect this to behave just like it does when a single tab is undone -- e.g. the tab is opened just where it was when it was closed.

uses undoCloseTab() instead of openOneOrMoreURIs()
I was attempting to be consistent w/ what "open in tabs" does for bookmarks and history. But overwriting existing tabs is bad. This is good.

urls[i] is an URL while undoCloseTab expects an integer index (which incidentally will have to be 0 in all cases).

The attached patch does away with the URLs completely (they're never needed) and for sake of clarity calls undoCloseTab with no argument at all (i.e. just reopen the most recently closed tab).

The only thing to consider is whether to focus the first (most recently closed) or the last restored tab (which currently happens). NB: reopening the tabs in inverse order might result in an incorrect tab order.

tested this and it looks good, thanks! we can deal with the focus question as part of bug 342432.
Fixed on trunk.

Problem: The current "Open All in Tabs" implementation uses the old openOneOrMoreURIs function, which overwrites existing tabs and doesn't restore state.

Solution: Use the undoCloseTab function, which will re-open the tabs in their original location and state.

Risk: Low

I'm assuming the fact that this was reopened is a mistake...
Don't know why but these radio buttons have a tendency of changing state when reloading a bug after logging in. My bad.
