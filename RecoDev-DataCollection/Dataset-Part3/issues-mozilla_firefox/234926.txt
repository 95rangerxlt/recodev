Hello. I access a website for our software vendor; the site is accessed via SSL
(not sure if this matters). Once I have logged into their site, if I click my
browser's "Back" button, I am returned to their login page. If I then hit the
'Forward' button, FireFox crashes reliably. This does not happen on a different
SSl site, so I'm not sure what exactly is causing it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into the SSL site
2. Hit browser back button
3. Hit broswer forward button

Actual Results:  
FireFox crashes.

Expected Results:  
Not crash ;)

Not sure, will reproduce again with TalkBack if I can and get that.

I can't find a TalkBack version of FireFox, so this is all I can give until
someone shows me the light.

From Window's "A program crashed" screen, it says the offset is 0041bf30.
Hrmmm... just download latest nightly, and I can't seem to reproduce this on it
right now... more info to come later.
I can't get the nightly to crash.. nevermind on this.
