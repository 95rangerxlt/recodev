This patch introduces a Utils.jsm that contains makeURI() and hasRootDomain(). We will need the latter for upcoming work.

Rename _SessionFile to SessionFile

Ok, while I'm at it... It always bugged me that we called it _SessionFile. Let's rename that to SessionFile (remove the underscore) so that it fits nicely with all our other modules.
That should be it. All those patches don't change how stuff works, they just move code around.

Sorry, sed fixed a couple of line endings that I didn't indent to include in the patch.
