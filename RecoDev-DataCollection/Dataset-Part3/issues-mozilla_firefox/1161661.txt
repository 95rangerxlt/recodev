I'm planning to use this bug to read up on NSIS and its scripting language to speed up reviews in the future. Let me know if this bug is too urgent for that.

And we only build the stub installer for nightlies, so the only way to find out whether a patch actually works is to land it, get it merged to m-c, and then burn a nightly? Fun!

Backed out in https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8f21d63b310a for https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=1462107&repo=mozilla-central,

I built it locally and this must have ran into a problem when compiling with the old NSIS that I asked to have upgraded / deployed to the build slaves over a year ago in bug 989531

patch - compatible with nsis 2.46

This is in addition to the existing patch. It removes the windows version checks from the ITBL3SetProgressValue and ITBL3SetProgressState macros. These aren't needed since the ITBL3Create macro which doesn't use the CallArtificialFunction macro checks the Windows version and if it isn't compatible with IID_ITaskbarList3 it leaves the $ITaskbarList3 var set to 0.
I also verified this works with NSIS 2.46 Unicode locally.

Missed the confvars change in the above try push... trying again

Try looks good and the stub was built. I'll land later tonight
