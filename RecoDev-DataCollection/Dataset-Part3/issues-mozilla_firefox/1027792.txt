This came up while I was working on bug 879008. Sometimes, graphs aren't available because there's not enough data to draw them. It'd be more elegant if the `linkAnimation` and `linkSelection` methods would gracefully handle such cases in which one graph isn't available, instead of API consumers having this responsibility.
