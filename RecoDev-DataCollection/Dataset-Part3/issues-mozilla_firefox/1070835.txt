0002-Bug-XXXXXXX-allow-browser_toolbox_window_reload_targ.patch

browser_toolbox_window_reload_target.js attaches load event handlers directly to the selectedBrowser, so sees events coming from the CPOW.  For some reason, it sees spurious events, so the test fails with incorrect reload counts.

Converting this test to use a frameScript and count the load events via that allows the test to pass.
