It's as easy as slapping a Task.spawn in a host.exec thing, and it means that we can function* in our commands.

Will probably land a fix in bug 975522 because it's close to a one-liner.

Note that you can also just do

  ...
  exec: Task.async(function* () {
    ...
  }),

The change to browser_gcli_fail.js is because when Task.spawn catches the exception, it rejects the promise with ex.getMessage() which means we get an added "Error: " in the output string.

Since this should work on the web there is a new host.exec() function which just executes the function on the web, but does a Task.spawn in Firefox.

Finally there was originally a badly named host.exec() before which really spawned a new task, so that is now called host.spawn.
Hi,
could you provide a Try link. Suggestions for what to run if you haven't
yet can be found here:

Joel, I don't think so this bug can cause those regressions in any way. DevTools are not even loaded while running such suites.
