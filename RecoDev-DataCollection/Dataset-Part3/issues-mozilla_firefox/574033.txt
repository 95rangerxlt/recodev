My first instinct when using the HUD is to run code that treats the global scope as the content's window.

Repro:
1) Open a console on a page with jQuery included
2) Type $ into the console

Actual:
ReferenceError: $ is not defined

Expected:
Console would log the function and I'd know I could experiment with my page's content...

Workaround:
window.$ does work properly, but without a tooltip many people won't know (or want to) use window explicitly.

Note: This is not a proper fix for the problem but more a work around (it uses a with(window) { xxx } statement! That's evil, I know...).

This work around shouldn't be necessary anymore after bug 572953 is fixed, which is about dealing with the root of the problem. In the meantime, this is the best/easiest solution.

i am a-ok with doing this until the platform issue is resolved. r=me.
you really should add a TODO comment about removing "with" referencing the bug 572953
where was this checked in?
i don't think it was yet.
