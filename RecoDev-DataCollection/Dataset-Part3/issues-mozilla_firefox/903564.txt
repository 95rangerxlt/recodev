I don't know what to do here, except redesigning the findbar completely to work like in Chrome.
I commented on this issue in bug 893446 comment 92:

I checked this on Nightly, and modifying the min-height and overflow properties for the page when the find bar appears actually seems to work. I added this to the page:

    html { min-height: calc(100% + 38px); overflow: hidden; }

(38px is the height of the find bar on Ubuntu.) I tried this on google.com, and found no user-visible issues or weirdness. This worked on the page in comment 0 as well.

The way I did it is indeed quite hacky, but the basic idea seems promising, so perhaps a real solution can be implemented.
Also fixed by bug 914180, right?

Yes, it was. Thanks for tracking this! I'm closing this as FIXED, but please change the flag if another resolution seems more appropriate.
