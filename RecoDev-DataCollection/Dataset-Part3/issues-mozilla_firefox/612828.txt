When a link target is shown in the location bar and it overlaps the current URL, the current URL fades out linearly, but the target fades in using "ease".  Similarly, when a target disappears, it fades out using ease, but the current URL fades in using cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.6, 1.0, 1.0).

It's a little jarring and unpolished.  The target and current URL should transition at the same rate.  The rate should be non-linear, because linear fades are slow and blah.

Bug 587908 comment 78 and bug 597769 explain why the rates are different -- to avoid flickering the current URL basically.

This patch makes 1) the target fade-in and current URL fade-out rate the same (ease) and 2) the target fade-out and current URL fade-in rate the same (cubic-bezier(0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)).  Rates 1 and 2 are unfortunately still different to avoid flickering the current URL.  I chose ease for rate 1 because it's nice, and if rates 1 and 2 have to be different then rate 1 should look nicer than rate 2 IMO.  Rate 2 is snappy and seems to avoid flicker just as well as the current rates do.

It also makes 1) the urlbar children (like the bookmark star) fade out the same as the target fade in and 2) the children fade in the same as the target fade out.

Er, why the two current URL rates are different, not why the target and current URL rates are different.
