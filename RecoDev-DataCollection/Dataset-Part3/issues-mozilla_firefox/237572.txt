add negotiateauth to the default list of firefox extensions.

the patch for bug 17578 enables support for the negotiate authentication
protocol via the GSSAPI libraries.  the extension is always built as a shared
library (even in static builds), so it should not require that end-users install
the GSSAPI libraries.

note, the extension is ignored on windows or whenever the GSSAPI libraries
cannot be found.
in a GCC 3.2.2 -Os build, this library is roughly 23k in size.
The Linux luna tinderbox built this extension, and it's interesting to note that
the codesize increase was just 5709 bytes.  I'm guessing that it is not counting
the DSO overhead.
darin, are you going to land this at some point? if you don't get to it, I'm
going to check in a bunch more patches over the next couple of days, so one more
isn't a big deal
