the full css, post patch

This bug and bug 692742 account for quite a bit of churn to gcli.css. It might help to look at attachment 573188 to see how things end up rather than wade through the patches.

Also you can look at/comment on https://github.com/mozilla/gcli/pull/44

Did you mean "gcli-in-valid"?

Yes. Good spot. It's fixed here: https://github.com/joewalker/gcli/commit/74b0d8fcb4d365313ababf2730558dc79819362a
Which is part of bug 699411

The fix above isn't part of attachment 573173, but it will be part of  bug 702621.

The reason for me wanting to avoid making new patches is that I fixed a bug in dryice (our build tool) which creates some churn in the way templates are serialized. Undoing this would cause quite a bit of patch churn, so unless there is actual breakage, I'd like to delay the fixes until the churn has landed.

Rebase to fix paths.

Dao: Please could you review this patch - it's taking a long time to land. Thanks.

I have no idea what "af" and "in" mean...

I think that probably doesn't worry me. If you knew that af stood for argfetch, would you be any the wiser? Either can be found easily in a search for those that want to know more.

'in' stands for input, by the way.
