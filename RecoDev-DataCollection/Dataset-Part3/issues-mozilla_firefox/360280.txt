Firefox still pulls mozilla/themes but doesn't build anything within it.

When the CVS modules were reorganised, it was put back in due to package fixups requiring it (http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/client.mk&rev=1.299&mark=270#265).

I've build Firefox without mozilla/themes present under linux and there are no apparent problems.

I also can't see any references to mozilla/themes in mozilla/browser or mozilla/toolkit.

I'd like to remove pulling mozilla/themes from Firefox as it will help to clarify who needs files in it (definitely SeaMonkey at the moment), especially as SeaMonkey is thinking of moving those files to within mozilla/suite.

Remove mozilla/themes from MODULES_browser

The fix. See comment 0 for discussion as to why this shouldn't be needed.
Does this make mozilla/themes completely SeaMonkey-specific? If so, that would be nice, as we'd like to move that dir to suite/themes in the long run...

Not quite, camino still pull mozilla/themes, I haven't looked as to why yet, but I think we'll deal with it in a separate bug.
Fix checked in, all main ff tinderboxes are still green after nightly builds :-)
