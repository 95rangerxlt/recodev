Replace "Firefox" with &brandShortName;
I've found two more places with hardcoded strings:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/installer/installer.inc#23

#define SETUP_TYPE_EXISTING The selected directory already contains a Firefox
installation. To delete %s completely, please press the 'Delete Directory'
button. Your Firefox settings should not be affected. Or, please press the
'Cancel' button and choose a different destination directory.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/toolkit/locales/en-US/installer/unix/install.it#16

DEFAULT_TITLE=Mozilla Installer

But it's installer part and I don't know how to fix it.


Benjamin, confirm/review/own? Pick your favorite ;-)

But the name of the web site IS Firefox Help and nothing else.

Firefox can change it's name one more time. And "Firefox Help web site" would be
"<insert new name> Help web site".
I believe that is purpose of &brandShortName; - don't make developers to go
through all .dtd files after renaming product.

Actually the purpose of &brandShortName; is to keep "toolkit" files from having
hardcode product names. This patch is fine to land on the trunk, but please
only fix update.dtd on the aviary branch.

It's all good (you don't need sr, and I can self-approve locale changes like
this).
Update.dtd checked in on the aviary branch. I'm going to leave this bug open for
the extra files on the trunk.

toolkit/mozapps/update/locale/update.dtd is not the correct file. I think you
want toolkit/locales/en-US/chrome/mozapps/update/update.dtd

Really, everything in toolkit/mozapps/update/locale should be cvs-removed.
