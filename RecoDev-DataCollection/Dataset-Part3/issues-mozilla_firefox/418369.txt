For many web pages containing both Chinese and English, when they're
printed, some English characters may disappear in the printout and 
appear as wide spaces (not boxes). Print preview looks fine though.

It has got nothing to do with the printer because it also happens with
the PDFCreator. It should have nothing to do my computer as IE6 works
fine on it and a colleague has the same problem.

This problem doesn't occur for pages containing English only (for
example, the English versions of those pages).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www2.cpttm.org.mo/training/sdb/showCourse.do?courseCode=CM214-03-2008-C&fsz=medium&po=0&noCPTTMLogo=0&l=c
2. File | Print and print to PDFCreator if possible.

Actual Results:  
Some English text is missing in the PDF.

Expected Results:  
Nothing should be missing in the PDF.
