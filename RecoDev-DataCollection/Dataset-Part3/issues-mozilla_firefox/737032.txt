We should have some kind of isValidXULTab() method that eases checking if a given XUL tab is still valid. The first place where this can be used is:

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/90d3b1fb284d

That's also how the check should be implemented (without the .pinned condition, of course). When dealing with asynchronous code wrt to tabs we should always check that the tab is still valid. There should already be other places where this check needs to be applied as well.

This looks good but there a couple of places where we should use isValidXULTab() as well:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/tabview/tabview.js#63
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/tabview/ui.js#794
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/tabview/tabitems.js#242

Please address the comments below, use isValidXULTab() in those other three places and ask me for review again. Thanks!

Please say what a "valid tab" exactly is (i.e. has not been closed, and not been removed from the DOM).

We can make this even simpler: 

return !xulTab.closing && xulTab.parentNode;

Thank you! Looks good to me, will push it to try.
Forgot, that my bugzilla and LDAP ID are different :(
