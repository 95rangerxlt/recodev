The Firebird autocomplete component doesn't have a default owner/assignee since
the departure of Joe Hewitt. As the QA for this component, I'm getting a little
discouraged at confirming bugs, creating test cases and giving encouragement to
patch makers only to have nothing happen since no one is paying attention.

We also need a Password Manager component for Firebird, since Autocomplete
really isn't the proper place for such bugs but it beats sending them all to
General.

Assigning to Asa. Asa, what can we do about it?

Ben seems to have been assigned to this now.
