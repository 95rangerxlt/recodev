Page style does not persist across sessions. 

STR:

1. Go to any web page with CSS
2. Change the View > Page Style to "No Style"
3. Restart your browser

Actual result:

The web page is restored, but with all the CSS, and not with the style you set.

Expected result:

The web page should be restored with "No Style" on still

fix

This patch saves the one information bit that's used by the View -> Page Style menu (the title of the currently enabled, named stylesheet(s)).

alternative fix

This alternative patch just saves the URLs of all disabled stylesheets and in addition to that the state of authorStyleDisabled (for "No Style"). This does however not necessarily restore the state as it can be set through View -> Page Style, as style sheets can be activated through JavaScript in ways the menu can't. Not sure which solution is better though...

fix

i prefer option #1, since it's broader, taking into account script actions as you mentioned, as well as pages that have changed since between restores. it provides a higher likelihood that the restored page will match the user's expectations.

unbitrotted and with tests

This is pretty much the same patch as you've already reviewed with two differences:
* we now ignore style sheets with a non-screen media type (e.g. for print)
* there's a bunch of tests included
