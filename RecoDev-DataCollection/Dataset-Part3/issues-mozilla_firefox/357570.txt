There is no way an extension can set up an overlay on the sidebarheader element since it lacks an ID.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Dom Inspector and look for sidebarheader

Actual Results:  
no id

Expected Results:  
specific id (like 'sidebarheader')

Reporter, do you still see this problem with the latest Firefox 2? If not, can you please close this bug as WORKSFORME. Thanks!

I still see the problem with FF 2.0.0.4
That's where an id attribute is missing, I guess:

Could you try to see if this has been fixed in Trunk nightly builds?
