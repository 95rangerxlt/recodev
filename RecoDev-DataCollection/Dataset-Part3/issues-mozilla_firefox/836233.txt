The computed view interface is noisy, a bit messy and the code mixes XUL and HTML.

In this bug I will:

- remove references to XUL content
- implement a more responsive design
- optimize the layout
- introduce the black theme (with a switch mechanism)
- kill some UI elements (the MDN link and the footer)

I'm not sure I'm with you on removing the MDN link, maybe find another way, but I think that's really useful.

Also did you mean to make those bugs depend on this rather than the other way around?

The problem with this MDN link is that it's rarely useful, but it's always here, and it makes the UI noisy. I talked to Mike, and we thought that moving this link into the context menu, and keep the F1 keybinding should be enough.

I don't know.

OK, makes sense.

Rule View is missing. I haven't tested on Windows yet.
PatchA is the biggest patch:

- introduces a devtools.theme pref
- rename csshtmltree files to computeview
- change the UI of the computed view:
  - XUL -> HTML
  - scale and overflow better
  - no MDN link visible (but F1 still works)
  - remove the footer with hints, we use the tooltip to say if things are matched/bestMatched/parentMatch.
- introduce generic theme CSS files

PatchB uses the generic theme CSS files in the markup view

PatchC introduces a mechanism to select the theme (light or dark, controlled by a pref for the moment)

PatchD uses the generic theme CSS files in the layout view
Next steps:
- attach ruleview code (WIP)
- make sure I don't break any test
- write test for theme switching
- get a ui review (I'll provide builds)
- figure out how to expose theme switching to the user (command?)

Not asking for a formal review for now. I'll provide builds to let you play with this once the ruleview is ready.

This looks really good. Feedback from me:

- I believe we should not use monospace for the "browser styles" checkbox - that's UI and it shouldn't be monospaced (nor search).

- In terms of UI consistency, putting the search field at the bottom is surprising for me.

- each property value has an arrow prefix, that should be ":" or maybe nothing? The ">" is confusing (">" is used for selectors).

- attach ruleview code (WIP)
- make sure I don't break any test
- write test for theme switching
- get a ui review (I'll provide builds)
- figure out how to expose theme switching to the user (command?)
- add license block to new files
- fix outlines around twisties

Looks great, r+
Paul, the screenshots are amazing!
Just some feedback I'd like to add:

- The user should be able to switch theme through an "Options" panel, that should be visible at will. At some point you will need an Options panel in order to add more stuff, instead of going through the about:config way. (btw, what's that button on the upper left corner?..)

- Are the scrollbars mac-specific, or are they devtools specific?

Let us know for any changes. :)

devtools specific.

Great for both! I guess we're gonna need to have the same theme on the JSTerminal as well.

Notice: The dark theme's scrollbars are a bit too thin, might need some more pixels in width for easier scrolling.
Next steps:
- see comment 15
- make sure the responsive mode still works (we use floating scrollbars)
Updated patches coming.

Next steps:
- make sure I don't break any test
- write test for theme switching

Will happen in follow-ups:
- get a ui review (I'll provide builds)
- get a better design for the checkboxes

@Paul: plz point to a temp build for testing the release.
This should fix most of the test failures: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=0a5035d1c235
Correct me if I am wrong, but in the patch floating-scrollbars.css file is importing itself on windows and linux due to which floating scrollbars in responsive mode are not working anymore.

I think you wanted to add the @import line in floating-scrollbars-light.css on windows and linux instead.

Remove context menus

Atomic approach: I can't make context menus work properly. Our copy/pasting mechanism is not really reliable (does it even work on Windows 8?), it's a lot of code, and it's a nightmare to test properly, and they don't bring much value. So I'm killing them.

Ctrl-c and Copy Selection are important though. This still works, but we need to have a proper context menu. As we use HTML documents, I think we should use a contentArea context menu, and enhance it with <html:menu> tags. I'll file a bug about that if Mike is ok with this patch.
