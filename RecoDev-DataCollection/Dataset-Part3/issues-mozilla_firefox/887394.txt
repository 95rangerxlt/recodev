Right after restoring the initial state for the first window loaded after startup, we call .saveState() only to set the session state from STOPPED to RUNNING to count startup crashes correctly.

It would be great to just change the state without writing the whole file but we cannot do that. What we can do is at least not collect the browser state at a point where probably nothing has even finished restoring, yet.

Do we actually need the call to saveStateObject?

Could we take the opportunity to remove that |delete| and replace it with an assignment? Calling |delete| destroys inline caching.

Looks good.
It might also prove useful for the day saveState becomes async.
