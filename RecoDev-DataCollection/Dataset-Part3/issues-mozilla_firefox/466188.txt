I guess this could also be a problem with amo, or something in the logic for updating ubiguity.

steps to reproduce might look something like

run fx3.0.x 
install ubiquity from labs.m.o
run a trunk build or fx3.1b2 candidate.

startup takes a long time, and in my case showed an message that was something like "looking for update to user agent switcher"

actually it was the search for ubiquity that was failing and eventually timed out.

might be several bugs here to spin off.

-update checking dialog should show the addon that its actually stuck on
-ubiquity should be hosted on amo 
-and ought to be compat with fx3.1b2

looks like ubiquity is on amo and marked compat with 3.1b2pre, so not sure why it might be timing out on the update check for me.

looking closer and trying to reproduce by clicking on [find updates] in the addon manager dialog I see that the status of the update check for the user agent switcher actually changes to "*finished checking* for user agent switcher" so that doesn't appear to be a bug.

still getting time out on the ubiquity check though.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Updating_extensions_for_Firefox_3.1 has good info on areas to check or make changes to for compatibility with fx 3.1
I think this is working now.  reopen if anyone still sees the problem.
