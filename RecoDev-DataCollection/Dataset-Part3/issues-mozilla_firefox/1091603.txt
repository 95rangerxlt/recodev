This test verifies whether or not filtering by 'xhr' in the network monitor works properly [0]. This relies on nsIXMLHttpRequest correctly asserting if a request channel is created via an XHR instance, which doesn't seem to work properly [1]. I manually verified this and the behavior is different there on e10s vs. non-e10s.
