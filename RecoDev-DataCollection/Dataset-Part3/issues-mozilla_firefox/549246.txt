Fix v.1

We didn't package "firefox" and run-mozilla.sh on OS X in bug 463605 because of bug 513747 - they would pick the wrong sqlite library on 10.6. Now that our sqlite library is named mozsqlite3.dylib, we should go back to shipping them, both to keep me from being annoyed by seeing them present but not packaged in make package-compare output and to possibly fix the underreported bug that Dreamweaver may or may not be trying to call the "firefox" script for preview, unless it's actually just spaces in the filename and not that at all.

(The "don't try to package the Linux shell icons" bit just snuck in, since it's the last thing left from package-compare that I didn't have another bug covering.)

I still think it's dumb, but whatever.

How does it make sense to be so obsessive about target milestones that you will change the one on this bug to a bogus value before the correct value has been created, but to then put a patch for another product in a bug which doesn't have milestones for that product?

Get your own bug, bug numbers are cheap.

For the /suite/ part only.

If the value is "bogus" then it is expected to be renamed to the "correct" value (and recreated), as I understood from recent releases.
But the process may have changed again, unless I just misunderstood.

What harm does it do to just do c-c ports in the same bugs the m-c changes happen?
(compared to the benefits)

So cheap that you're indeed welcome to file the "151" remaining bugs to deal with

I'll be happy to use them.

Get out of my bug.
We should probably take this on 1.9.2 to fix the DreamWeaver thing.
The DW bug (bug 549680) is of the opinion that it's because they use WWW!OURL, for which we dropped support, rather than because they use the "firefox" script instead of firefox-bin. I guess if someone wanted to send me a free copy, I'd be willing to check which it actually is :)
Ted, given that this is almost certainly not what caused bug 549680 (although for all their whining, no DW users there have apparently tested the try-build which has my fix for that bug), what are your current thoughts about taking this on 1.9.2 along with the backport of bug 513747 and bug 519550?
If you backport those patches to 1.9.2 you're welcome to take this one as well, since it has zero impact on how we normally run the browser.
