Which method are you using to attach the image? Are you getting the OS file selection window, using drag and drop, or some other Yahoo mail upload utility? (http://help.yahoo.com/tutorials/cg/mail/cg_compose4.html). What extensions do you have installed? Does it work in safe mode? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode
I use Yahoo.ca Mail.
When I click on attach a box comes up with this title
Select File(s) to upload by ca.mg3.mail.yahoo.com

I click on the file to select it then click OPEN

the box closes and at the bottom of the email a small box open to show progress of the upload. 

It grinds away for a while then gives the failure message.

When following the same procedure using Internet Explorer it works fine!

Attachments now on Firefox are

Add Bookmark Here 3.5.20090920
AVG Safe Search  9.0.0.701
Currency Converter  1.5
Java Quick Start  1.0
Microsoft.net framework assistant 1.1
Does the issue still happen in safe mode? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode. Trying to make sure it is a FF issue and not an extension issue.

I tried it with 3.5.5 and didn't have an issue.
I have the same problem. I'm using Firefox 3.5.5 on a Vista Home Premium System. I was able to attach files 700KB below. Anything above 700KB returns this message -- "Ouchâ€¦there's a problem attaching picture.bmp. (894KB)". When using IE8, the file attached without any problems.
Users reports issue resolved (via email). 

@burubudur17@yahoo.com.ph - if you are experiencing the issue, please try to upload in Safe Mode (http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode). If that works, you likely have an extension issue - see http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Troubleshooting+extensions+and+themes..
