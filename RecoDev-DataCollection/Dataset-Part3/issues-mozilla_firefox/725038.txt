Scratchpad selection over the final line

I think this is a cross-platform problem. I can reproduce it in Linux and Windows.

Usually, selection should stop at a point beyond which the caret hasn't traversed, but I might be wrong. If this is a bug to fix in Linux and Windows, I could take it up.

This is working "as designed", but it's a bit unexpected, indeed.

If you do Shift-Down you can't move the cursor to some offset that doesn't exist on the next line. This needs to be special-cased in Orion's upstream code to go to the end of the line when it's the last line. Similar for Shift-Up.

Thanks Pranav! This is not directly a source editor bug. This is an Orion bug. If you want to fix this, please do it upstream. See http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion for how to get started.
Orion upstream has fixed the bug. That fix will land in Firefox with the next Orion update we will do.
fixed by upstream changes. Closing.
