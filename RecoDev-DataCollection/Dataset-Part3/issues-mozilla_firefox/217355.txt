I don't know what exactly is the problem but I figure it has something to do
with FTP support. I tried to upload, delete, and make directories on my server
using Rumpus FTP and going to it from another computer using Firebird. I always
got an error that said Permission Denied. I don't know why although I wish I
knew how to figure out what is causing this.
When I tried it in Mozilla 1.2.1 and Internet Explorer 6 SP1 it worked fine so
that's how I know it's a Firebird 0.6.1 bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse to the online FTP site which is http://5500.servehttp.com:81/
2.Login
3.Try to upload or delete something. Or make a new directory.

Actual Results:  
I got an error that said Permission denied. The error is served by the Rumpus
FTP server on a web page.

Expected Results:  
The web page should have told be it was a success.

I just tried it now with the latest truck and it worked.
