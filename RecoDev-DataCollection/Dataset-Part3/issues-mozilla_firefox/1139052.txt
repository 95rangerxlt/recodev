r+, but I don't completely understand the logic below.  If in fact there is some problem with it, then please do post a new patch, despite the r+.

I was confused by this at first because I was thinking the point of this method is to say whether or not a suggested tile should be shown, and so the negation on the two mostFrecentLink.targetedSite terms seemed backwards.

But like the method's name says, the point is to say whether the suggested tile has changed visibility, basically, right?  So the first && expression in this conditional says, "we can now show a suggested tile," and the second && expression says, "we should now hide the suggested tile," is that basically right?  If so, I still don't completely understand the first && expression, because if the most frecent link does not have a targeted site, then no suggested tile can be shown even though there are >= 8 history tiles, right?

Actually, it does seem that this method is being used in two different ways.  The onLinkChanged caller seems to be using it as, "did the suggested tile change visibility?"  But the _updateSuggestedTile caller seems to be using it as, "should the suggested tile be visible?"

Not quite.. if mostFrecentLink has a targetedSite then mostFrecentLink is a suggested link. So the logic says if we have enough history links (8+) to show a suggested tile and we are not already showing a suggested tile, then we should update (to *attempt* to add a suggested tile). OR if we don't have enough history to show a suggested tile (<8) and we are currently showing one, we should update (to remove it) 

So I guess it's checking for both suggested tile visibility and number of history tiles.

yes

If the most frecent link does not have a targeted site, that means it is not a suggested link. But I don't see why this would mean no suggested tile can be shown?
Thanks for explaining, my understanding was wrong about what link.targetedSite means.  r+ still stands, but would you mind adding a comment in the code saying pretty much what you said in your first paragraph in comment 5?  It's really helpful.
