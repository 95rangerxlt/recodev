Documented the pinned attribute for tabs, which was not yet documented:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Attribute/pinned

That's linked to from:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/tab

Documented the pinTab and unpinTab methods on tabbrowser, which also was not yet documented:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Method/pinTab
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Method/unpinTab

Those are linked from:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/tabbrowser

And the TabPinned and TabUnpinned events are now documented as well (as well as any of our events are documented, anyway):

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Code_snippets/Tabbed_browser#Notification_when_a_tab_is_pinned_or_unpinned

Firefox 4 for developers is also updated. Whew!
