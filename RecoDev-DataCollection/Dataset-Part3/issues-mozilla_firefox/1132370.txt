A few tests have this on gum, and I've seen it once manually working with it.

This is popping up everywhere in tests.
Right now, this is one of the most prevalent fails on try. Need to fix this!

Any progress on this?
Working on it.

Awesome. Is this worth an uplift to aurora? There's no b2g version based on fx38, but I think that will be an ESR version.
