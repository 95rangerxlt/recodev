When you drag a button from the toolbar or panel to the palette while it's disabled, the [disabled] attribute is not removed, thus keeping the disabled appearance.
For bug 873398 we introduced a custom class for items in the panel. As far as I can tell, we have opacity rules for this on all platforms, and this more specific rule is breaking the behaviour of not showing items as being disabled if in customization mode. Also, it seems we don't remove this class correctly when moving items from the panel to the palette, for some reason, and it's doing extra work in buildArea which is in the hotspot for tspaint (see bug 880611). So, I thought it might make sense to just remove this.
