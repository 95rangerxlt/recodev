Screnshot of Italian installer (12b4)

Current Italian localization of OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS_DESC is "Il servizio di manutenzione consente di installare gli aggiornamenti di $BrandShortName senza bisogno di interventi da parte dell'utente.", which should be around 130 characters. The result is shown in the attachment: the string is cut before character #100

According to notes in installer/custom.properties I can't add a new line on my locale.
"You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string from en-US contains a \n."

Is it possible to make that line wrap? I can try to shorten that string somehow, but the resulting translation would be less clear for users (and that's an important piece of information). I also suspect that this issue involves other locales, not only Italian (maybe German and French, they're around 100 characters long).

Thanks for taking this, looks good.
Pushed to fx-team

Adding tracking flags.

Drivers, this causes locales with longer than en-US text to have the text cut-off for the description of the maintenance service in the installer. It is only shown during a custom installation.

Thanks for tracking and testing this and to Francesco for reporting it in the first place!
Did the text in some of the locals changed? For e.g the text on the Italian Installer is different between Firefox 12 beta 5 and Firefox 13 beta 6.
Verified using Firefox 13 beta 6 on Windows 7 and on Windows XP that the text from the Installer that refers to the Maintenance service is complete.
