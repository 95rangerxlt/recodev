Following the landing of bug 870100 the pref setting no longer is affective in blocking thumbnails from being displayed.

I'm not really sure why we have both browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled and browser.pageThumbs.enabled. Seems like the former prevents some work that the latter doesn't (adding a bunch of observers in gBrowserThumbnails.init), but they're otherwise mostly the same. Seems like we should remove one or the other?
Indeed - 
added the apparently hidden pref: browser.pageThumbs.enabled set to 'false' and no thumbs are displayed 

pref: browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled is set currently to: 'true' 

So seems that one or the other could control everything for sure..

A quick test of setting browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled to 'false' 
does not re-enable display of thumbs, so appears that perhaps the new hidden 
pref: browser.pageThumbs.enabled set to 'false' will control everything ?

Further testing of just toggling browser.pageThumbs.enabled will enable/disable thumbs display in a NewTab. 

No coder here, but seems that the older pref: browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled 
could indeed be removed ?

I think we should remove that one that "prevents some work" for 2 reasons:

* It prevents that work, but also means that Fx needs to be restarted after the preference is toggled.  It would be possible to fix that, but ...

* It's a hidden preference, so a tiny minority of users will ever set it.  It's not worth avoiding this extra work for such users, especially if it means even more code so the pref can be toggled and have it honored without a restart.

This patch removes the browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled preference (it only appears in one place) and leaves the browser.pageThumbs.enabled preference alone.
hrm - on the downside, a quick google for that pref name shows quite a number of hits.  We can obviously update MDN - maybe doing that and ensuring the old pref name is still there means users are still likely to find it via google?

How complicated would it be to go the other way and keep browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled instead?

Not hard - I think we'd just still remove the check in the patch I uploaded (ie, in the init() function) and rename the other few occurrences of the pref to this.

OTOH though, looking at the google results, it is almost as though browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled is the pref to mean "disable the capture of sensitive pages" - which we have since fixed - so in some ways we are doing the users a favour as we will be automatically turning on thumbnails now they are "safe" ;)

But yeah - that is a stretch :)  So here is one that keeps only browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled.  Take your pick :)

I would really like to know why those tests need to disable the service too. Maybe lump that in with bug 896912?
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/b487df56bcfe

I think we should uplift this to 25 so people who have already set the browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled continue to work as expected in that version.

So, I'm confused..
which pref was removed ?
browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled 
browser.pageThumbs.enabled

It appeared from a quick look that the top pref was 'removed' in favor in the 2nd pref

Sorry, didn't read the actual patch.

I 'reset' the top pref 'browser.pagethumnails.capturing_disabled and restarted and the pref was gone, as I suspected would happen with the removal of the pref.

However, with browser.pagthumbe.enabled set to 'false' I'm now seeing thumbs again, and now readding the browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled and setting to 'true' I'm still getting thumbs even after repeated deletions of the 
J:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\default.xxxxxxx thumbnails 
folder.

I can't seem to turn them off at all now...
both pref's retained and 'hidden' ?  

I have:
browser.pageThumbs.enabled;false
browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled;true
browser.pagethumbnails.storage_version;3

and after deleting the thumbnails folder - I still see thumbs...
browser.pageThumbs.enabled was removed and is now ignored by Firefox.

browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled is the pref you can use to disable thumbnail collection in general.
Thanks Gavin

removed (reset - browser.pagethumbs.enabled)
deleted cache folder
deleted thumbnails folder 

Both with Firefox Closed - restarted - and still getting thumbs. :(
Re-opening, 
pref: browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled no longer blocks thumbnails with this patch landing.

Tested on latest m-c hourly based on cset: 
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/79b5c74ef97b

I deleted cache and thumbnails folders several times and thumbs keep on coming back.
Removed via add/remove and reinstalled from a fresh download of the build with above cset, and still seeing thumbs.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/fd829b4478e3
I'm now totally confused, went back to a 7/24/13 build prior to the landing of but 870100, and with the pref browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled = True 

I'm still getting thumbs...where before I certain that was not case.

Pretty spectacular screwup by me.  The new pref's meaning is negated: "browser.pageThumbs.enabled" -> "browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled" - but the values only negated in one place - they should all have been.

At least the default case (ie, no pref existing) is OK - so only when there was a value for browser.pagethumbnails.capturing_disabled did things go wrong.

I neglected to fix head.js in the thumbnails dir as I mistakenly thought that was the only thing I didn't screw up last time.  This patch fixes that too.
