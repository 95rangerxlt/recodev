There appears to be an extra slash '/' character in our web console tests' URI references. These should be removed.

I hope I didn't miss any occurrences of double slashes inside the tests!
wow, that was quick! In fact, it was a little *too* quick! Doing this now will break bug 692625 which'll probably require a rerun of whatever script did the work in the first place. In short, it could be messy for Ed.

Could we get this after 692625 lands?

Sure, I will cancel review for now, then will redo it once it was landed.
