proposed test fix

Proposed test fix. Changes:

- the DOMContentLoaded event is fired before load, and we are trying to reload the page before it completes the first load. Changed the code to use only the load event.

- use executeSoon() in the onLoad event handler because we do not want to ask for reloading while the browser still executes the onload event handlers. We push the reload() call a bit later this way.

- we use a synthetic MouseEvent that is not wrapped by xpcom, to workaround a bug in Gecko that prevents the logging of exceptions thrown in event handlers executed by synthetic events.

- removed the output error line check, because that depends on UI localization and was unneeded. I don't know when this check was added. Afaik, it wasn't in the initial test I submitted.

The test now runs fine in opt and debug builds.

Canceling review request - this only a test fix, and it seems reviews are not needed for such changes.
Adding checkin-needed, given it's only a test change.
