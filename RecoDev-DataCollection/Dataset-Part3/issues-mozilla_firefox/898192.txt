wip.1 Skip social function calls when !SocialUI.enabled

onLocationChange calls the following functions even when SocialAPI is disabled:
          SocialMark.updateMarkState();
          SocialShare.update();

These functions do more work than necessary for this hot code path.

This looks good to me, anything else needed here? Only thing that I wonder is if we can make Social.enabled faster so it can cache the state until something makes it dirty.

I take this back. Social.enabled only checks the Social._provider private variable. Somehow I had thought that this in turn checked all of the providers to see if any of them were enabled, but I was wrong.

So this looks good to land from my POV as long as all tests pass.

Matt, is there anything QA needs to do to verify this is fixed?
Verification for this shouldn't be necessary and it would be hard to verify anyways.

Thanks Jared.
