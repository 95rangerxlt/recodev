Rendering engine name is hardcored, so we can't localize it to correct czech
form. Instead of correct "Pohaneno Geckem" we have "Pohaneno Gecko" (back
translation to english should be "Powered Gecko" - without "by").

300         <p id="gecko" class="center">&credit.powered; Gecko&trade;</p>
                                                          ^^^^^

The simplest solution should use new entity like &credit.poweredByGecko;, what
allow us to provide best phrase.

There is already a nowhere used entity credit.gecko in 
<!ENTITY credit.gecko  "Gecko Layout Engine">

Allow declension of Gecko
Pawell, maybe &trade; entity should be inside &credit.poweredByGecko; -
otherwise  "Gecko" word will have limit to be last word in sentence.
Created attachment 186909
Allow declension of Gecko with trade [checked in]
-> FIXED
