Do you have a crash report in about:crashes that you can share with us?
I think this is correct crash report: https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/ff677fd6-c21d-4ad2-8597-3217c2141111

I tried to recreate this bug again with a new profile with only this addon to generate a new crash report. It crashed and the page loading icon doesn't stop spinning. Attaching a screenshot.

Any other tab that is already loaded also crashes when i try to load youtube. No crash report is generated.

Julian Viereck posted a crash ID in bug 1097612:

This crash appears to be an assertion failure from reentering nsThread::ProcessNextEvent().
InBasic and Alopepeo, your "YouTube Video and Audio Downloader" add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
Latest beta version of the extension is now compatible with e10s,
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-video-and-audio-dow/versions/
I tested with beta version of addon and it is working correctly.
Let's keep this open until the beta code makes it to the release version.
I have just submitted version 0.4.2 for review. This bug report as well as https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1075249 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1106672 can now be closed.
Version 0.4.2 is now available on AMO.
