If you try to drag any widget into the testBar (or out of it, if you had previously added anything to it), it won't work. It seems like it can be customized (has all the hover effects and all), but the widgets won't land there, or can't be dragged out of it. You need to close customize mode and open it again to customize the toolbar.

This seems important (I don't think the system was meant to force new toolbars to be added only when not in customize mode, please let me know if I'm mistaken), so I'm CC'ing you directly again.

Addendum: closing customize mode after adding the toolbar also makes the widgets unclickable, it still tries to drag them as if it were still in customize mode. Only after re-entering customize mode does everything go back to normal (so far as I've seen at least).
Tentatively marking as P3-, although it's a bit of an edgecase and might be closer to P4...

Unfortunately I suspect fixing this will require API changes, which I'd rather have in 29, hence the P3-.
For what it's worth, I don't think it's so edgy-casy. Many users use multiple windows, and if one of them is in customize mode and in the other they enable/restart an add-on, or if an add-on updates in the background (this is possible right?) while in customize mode for example they would experience this.

But of course the fix is easy for the user (close and re-open customize mode) and for the add-on (close customize mode before any changes are made), so I can see how by that it wouldn't be very high priority. Just to say, I don't think it's as edgy as you make it sound. :)

I think this isn't true on Mozilla's scale (ie, comparatively few people use multiple windows)

This is also not very likely.

I'm not sure it is.

I believe this should fix the issue (wrote the test first, then went to fix everything else...) took a bit more work than I had hoped, but it works now.

This looks sensible - but also a bit risky for a 29 uplift, so I suspect you weren't hoping for that?

I'd like to see a CART run with this patch compared with a baseline. I'm particularly worried about the removal of the deferred toolbar item wrapping method calls.

We should also set dev-doc-needed for the new events.

Hm, not exactly intuitive, but I get the rationale...

Perhaps instead, each event could be passed a boolean to indicate whether the reason was due to a window opening / closing, or for some other reason (add-on enabled / disabled). Just an idea. I'm not adamant about it, but it would make these two events more...er... "symmetrical"? There might be a better word for it.

Hm, this isn't _exactly_ the same. Before, the deferredWrapToolbarItem allows us to let the event loop tick a few times between wrappings. _wrapItemsInArea does them all in one shot...

Same as above - we lose the event loop breathes by doing it this way...

Why is this now necessary? If we're doing this, we should probably output the ex.message while we're at it.

Actually, yes, if plausible I think we should uplift this. I'm uncomfortable with the public API we propose being able to mess itself up like it does right now.

If I revert the relevant bits of yield-removal, do you still need one? (needinfo for this)

I suspect people won't be interested in the 'window died' case, but perhaps I'm wrong. In any case, I guess I can do this, yes.

Ugh, I should have realized this. The refactoring isn't necessary, so I'll just undo it instead.

It isn't *necessary* - debug code I left in - but it doesn't hurt much. I should probably still remove it.
Yeah, if you revert the yield bits, then I'm last concerned about CART. :)

Yes, I like this better - thanks Gijs.

The one thing to point out is that your test is absolutely humongous - it could probably be broken up into smaller tests. I'm fine landing it this way, but we should probably file a bug to break that test up a bit.

This is an absolutely massive test, and it seems to me it's testing a number of smaller things.

I think we should (at some point) break this up.

Filed bug 996324.

Note that actually, it could probably be formulated to be shorter. Could also split up the events testing from the testing that customize mode deals correctly with such events.
Comment on attachment 8406489
registerArea should work correctly with customize mode,

[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Australis
User impact if declined: adding areas while customize mode is open doesn't integrate them with customize mode
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): has automated test, hopefully reaches m-c in the next few hours
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): medium. I can't pretend this is a tiny patch with no risk. OTOH, it's mostly generating events, plus making customize mode do stuff with those events, and for both the events and the customize mode actions, there's an automated test. Assuming this sticks and makes it through a nightly (Tuesday's) with no regressions turn up (Wednesday), I'd like to land this on 29 for consistency and add-on compat.
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: none, but added two more events to CustomizableUI listeners (in a JSM).

Quick question, these events are still not documented in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/CustomizableUI.jsm, it's been a few releases already and they're kind of important. Should I also file a new bug for these kinds of things or just ask here directly? (I'm not sure how docs-related things should be handled.)

It's a wiki, you should feel free to add stuff yourself! As it is, I just added docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/CustomizableUI.jsm$compare?to=681137&from=615461

Please feel free to improve if necessary.
I wasn't sure if I should, but I will do from now on, thanks for the info.
