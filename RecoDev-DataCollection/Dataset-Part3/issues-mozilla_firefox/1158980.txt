Testing w/ today's integration build and noticed that the Pocket logos seem to be somewhat inconsistent (although this is possibly already captured by 1158883).

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Enable Pocket and add icon added to a toolbar.
2. Go to a random page (http://bing.com) and add it to Pocket.
3. Note in the Pocket doorhanger, the Pocket toolbar icon is blue, the favicon in the tab bar is a light red, and the logo in the doorhanger is more of a crimson.

### Actual results:
toolbar icon should be pocket red instead of blue?
logo color in doorhanger is different from favicon icon color.

### Expected results:
should match favicon color (for consistency)

Adding mmaslaney.  I think we need to change this and go back to the Pocket color.  The blue is more consistent with our toolbar but totally foreign to Pocket; I'm feeling like it would be better to keep inline with their brand for this than our toolbar color.
I'm happy change it back, but I think we should consider a unified color as we continue to scale up partnerships.
