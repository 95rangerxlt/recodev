When running tests we seem to often not have a valid session state backup file to remove:

> JavaScript Error: "Uncaught asynchronous error: Unix error 2 during operation remove (No such file or directory) at undefined" {file: "resource:///modules/sessionstore/_SessionFile.jsm" line: 108}
> JavaScript Error: "Could not remove session state backup file: Unix error 2 during operation remove (No such file or directory)" {file: "resource:///modules/sessionstore/_SessionFile.jsm" line: 246}

These are caused by SessionFile.wipe(). I think wipe should not report an error to the console in case the files don't exist. After all that's what we want to achieve when wiping :)

don't report errors when wipe() tries to remove non-existant session files
Saw it on Windows, too.
Can you use:

} catch (ex if !self._isNoSuchFile(ex)) {
// Nothing
} catch (ex) {

?
I actually wanted to give that a try because I was quite sure that this works but I didn't really like the empty catch clause in there. Is this really better than the if statement?
Seems clearer to me (maybe with a more useful comment than "// Nothing"), but I guess I don't feel strongly.

Looks good to me, with a possible suggestion.
Oh, and I'm not sure "non-existant" exists in English. Perhaps "non-existent"?

Why not the following?

catch (ex if self._isNoSuchFile(ex)) {
  // Ignore exceptions
} catch (ex) {
  Cu.reportError(...);
  throw ex;
}

Oops.

Yeah, I like that more. I should've thought of that :)

Isn't that what I said in comment 3 (minus a typo and a better comment)? o_O

Comment 3 has an exclamation mark. Or is that the typo? I assumed your comment was misplaced but probably the exclamation mark was :) Whatever, thanks to you both my patch is now nicer and I'll go ahead and land it.
