Reproduced using Nightly 37.0a1 2014-12-18 under Mac OSX 10.9.5, Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit and Win 7 64-bit.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Preferences/Search in both in-content and window mode
2. Hover over the table's header
3. Try to click the table's columns

Expected results:
No highlight on table header if there's no action on the columns. 

Actual results:
In-content preferences highlights the header on all platforms; on Ubuntu the columns can be clicked too.
Preferences/Search in separate window allows the columns to be clicked (all platforms) - such as they were buttons. Under Ubuntu and Windows, the text is moved 1px when this happens.

The CSS rule that causes the color of the header to change on hover is: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/3d846527576f/toolkit/themes/shared/in-content/common.inc.css#l644

I think we could add an attribute on the treecol elements to indicate that no sorting is possible, and tweak that CSS selector.
