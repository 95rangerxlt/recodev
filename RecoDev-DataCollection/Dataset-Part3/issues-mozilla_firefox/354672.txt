when attempoting to go to the SECOND page of search results it loops back to the first page
this error did NOT occure in Moozilla 1.5.0.6

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Under Browse job ads
1. click on accounting jobs
2. in the search box under location slect melbourne
3. under area select melbourne-east

5. Work type should be left as any
6. sub classification is accountant
7. specialization/skills is assistant/graduate
8. show me jobs from last 7 days
9. scroll down the resulting seach page 'till you see the 1 2 3 .. next option
10. select next

2.
3.

Actual Results:  
page will appear to go to page 2 BUT it is actually page one of the search refreshing

Expected Results:  
it should have given the second page of search results

1.5.0.6 worked ok
IE 5.5 sp2 works ok

If you choose otehr professions besides accounting that do not have a specialisation/skill entry  all works as expected


BTW I created a hotmail account for this bug report and our dear friends at redmond put your email with my user id and pw straight into junk mail :-)

Thanks for that.
It means it's only my PC. But the only thing that has changed since Sunday is the upgrade to Firefox. I'll try a de-install and re-install.

A de-install then rebootand re-install has fixed whatever the cause was.
It's now working correctly
