This is a tracker bug for shipping the feature implemented in bug 486262.  Currently, the pref disables itself when the feature hits beta.

I'm adding the current bugs that we know we need to fix before we ship as dependencies here.

we are no longer using the relnote keyword. relnote-firefox is better.
Lawrence proposed that:

Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]: No more searching for the noisy tab. Tab audio indicators with mute button. https://twitter.com/mmmandel/status/626874461686497280
[Suggested wording]: New: Easily identify tabs playing audio and mute audio per tab
[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]:
http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2015-07-30/tab-audio-indicators-and-muting-in-firefox-nightly

and it seems that it is planned for 42.

Also note the additional UI we're implementing in bug 1189759.
Virtul_ManPL, please stop changing the bug dependencies.  I have also sent you an email.  Thanks!

I'm planning to land this when we feel comfortable about all of the blockers being addressed, but we're pretty close so I might as well get review on this now!

Added to the 42 release notes "Audio tab indicator with muting capabilities"
Better wording appreciated.

I will add a link once the user doc is completed.
[Suggested wording]: "Indicator added to tabs that play audio with one-click muting (Adobe Flash supported since version 19)"
Much better, updated. Thanks!
Sylvestre, please don't say anything about Flash support until we have a beta build that works, at the very least.  (bug 1189772)  Thanks!

Nevermind, Adobe released a fix today.
