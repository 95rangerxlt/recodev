STR:

1. Open debugger
2. Ctrl/Cmd + F
3. Type something that is found at least once in the current source

Pressing Enter jumps to the next match. I've been spoiled to expect Shift+Enter to jump backwards to the previous one. Maybe some other users are just as spoiled as well :)

Hello, I would like to take this bug as my first fix.
Hi Jacob, most definitely! Thanks for the interest.

The logic for the search keyboard accessibility is defined by the _onKeyPress function on the FilterView prototype in browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-toolbar.js

There's a switch statement there that decides whether the action to perform is selecting forward or backwards, for which DOM_VK_RETURN and DOM_VK_ENTER falls through. This shouldn't happen anymore, and depend on the e.shiftKey property.

Do you have any experience with building firefox from source? Here's a tutorial if not: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build Let me know if you have any questions about that.

Afterwards, you'll also need to test this new functionality. Add a few new assertions in one of the already existing tests (browser_dbg_search-basic-01.js comes to mind as a good candidate). This is a browser mochitest and you can run it via the `mach` command: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach
Hi Victor, 

I indeed have Firefox already checked out of Mercurial and build via ./mach.

I will write my code, generate a patch and upload it to here for review shortly.

Thank-you,
Jacob.
Thank *you*! Good luck.
Hi Victor,

In order to incrementally build devtools without compiling the entire project, should I be within this directory:

/Users/jacobclark/Development/mozilla-central/obj-x86_64-apple-darwin12.5.0/toolkit/devtools

Executing

$ make

Thanks for the support,
Jacob.
I usually build inside browser: ./mach build browser
Fantastic thanks, that's gone through successfully. 

Will continue and update on a solution shortly.

Very good work! I only have one comment below, other than that, this is perfect. Please submit an updated patch, then I'll push to try and land it if everything is green.

To be completely correct, isReturnKey should be true in both cases, since that's what happened, regardless of whether shift is pressed or not. I would write this as:

case e.DOM_VK_RETURN:
case e.DOM_VK_ENTER:
  var isReturnKey = true;
  actionToPerform = e.shiftKey ? "selectPrev" : "selectNext";
  break;
