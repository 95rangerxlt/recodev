Fix v.1

Trying to make toolkit/components/printing/content/printUtils.js better-behaved by moving its |var XUL_NS =| out of the global scope (because it winds up conflicting with an even worse-behaved const in editor, in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey) pointed out to me that search.xml only works because printUtils.js defines XUL_NS for it. That seems... fragile.

Oops, r-, doesn't follow the style of the rest of the file of defining a const and wrapping under 80 cols.
