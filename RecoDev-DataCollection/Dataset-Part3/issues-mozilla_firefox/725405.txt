The "code -> ctrl-l -> backspace" thing can still work if, in the selection, the "\n" is included.

Yes, that would be nice.

Proposed fix.

Added a newline character in front of the comment block that is generated
by the writeAsComment function of the Scratchpad editor.

The preceding newline character is being selected aswell when a user presses cmd+L, so the method that past described above still works.
Spyros: thank you for taking this bug and submitting a patch!

Great patch!

Now this patch doesn't need a new test, but Scratchpad has tests that are now broken by the change in writeAsComment(). Please run the Scratchpad tests and fix the failing tests in browser/devtools/scratchpad/test/. I see:

Browser Chrome Test Summary
	Passed: 221
	Failed: 21

Looking forward for the updated patch!
