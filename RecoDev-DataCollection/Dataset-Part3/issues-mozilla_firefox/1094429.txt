STR:
 1. Start a debug build.
 2. Inspect the first few lines of output.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
This appears in the output:
{
JavaScript strict warning: chrome://browser/content/sanitize.js, line 74: SyntaxError: in strict mode code, functions may be declared only at top level or immediately within another function
}

This seems to be for the function "onWindowsCleaned":
> 58   sanitize: function (aItemsToClear)
> 59   {
> 60     var deferred = Promise.defer();
[...]
> 77       function onWindowsCleaned() {

This function was just added last week in bug 1088137:
 https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/61cbd994f800

dolske, can we refactor this such that it doesn't spam a startup JS warning?
