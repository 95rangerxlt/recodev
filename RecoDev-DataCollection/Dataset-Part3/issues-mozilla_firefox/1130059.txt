We will probably need to disable Shumway on Windows XP, too, because we don't have an H.264 platform decoder.

Enable Shumway by default in Nightly on OS X and Windows Vista+ for whitelisted SWFs

This patch enables Shumway for the Amazon video player on systems that're known to have suitable h.264 decoders. (The detection of Vista+ is done in browser/extensions/shumway/content/ShumwayBootstrapUtils.jsm at runtime.)

We want to get this in as a first, conservative step towards having Shumway take over for high-value content that we know to work. The Amazon video player has undergone extensive testing and it works very well in Shumway.

Our startup time is currently worse than the Flash plugin's, but for the Amazon video player it's still fast enough to feel almost immediate. We're working on improving startup time and will get it to be competitive with Flash before Shumway rides the trains.

There's potential for a startup time regression, but a Talos run of a functionally identical patch didn't show any major changes: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=0162b2eb78ef

Please invert the conditional to use "ifdef UNIX_BUT_NOT_MAC" instead of ifndef.
Thanks for the review!
