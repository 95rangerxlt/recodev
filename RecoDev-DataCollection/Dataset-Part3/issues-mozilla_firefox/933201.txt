Sure. Code lives there: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/app-manager/

Original button is here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/app-manager/content/device.xhtml#39

We want to move it there: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/app-manager/content/connection-footer.xhtml

Yes, I am still working on this.
Hi, 

I created a patch for this. I put the button in the footer, but i have a problem, the button didn't work. I was trying to add at the final:

<script type="application/javascript;version=1.8" src="device.js"></script>

in connection-footer.xhtml, but it didn't work. I enabled the Browser console, i can't see a warning/alert related to this. If i don't add the device.js file i got:

UI.screenshot: is not a defined function

I was trying to put the pice of code about screenshots from device.js to connection-footer.js but i didn't work. If you can give some tips and advices about what is wrong, i will really appreciate. I am going to attach the first version of the patch, if someone is interested on review it and tell me if everything is good to continue, i am going to be very happy.

Regards,
Gio

That's the right way to do it. What didn't work?
It didn't open a new tab and take the screenshot. Look this patch with the modifications.

You need to adapt the code to make it work from connection-footer.js. Here this.connected doesn't exist, getDeviceFront either. Look at the browser console, you'll see plenty of errors.

That's exactly what we need.
Can I just ask you to swap disconnect and screenshot? (disconnect first, then screenshot). Then we'll land your patch.

Thanks a lot!

App Manager is replaced by WebIDE, so I'm clearing this dev-doc-needed.
