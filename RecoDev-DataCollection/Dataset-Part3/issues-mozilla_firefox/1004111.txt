We may as well move the remaining icons all at once.

If we use `hg rename browser/themes/linux/devtools/whatever.png browser/themes/shared/devtools/images/whatever.png` it will keep history on them.

Then we can remove the icons from the remaining folders, and update browser/themes/*/jar.mn to replace (devtools/whatever.png) with (../shared/devtools/images/whatever.png).

Shouldn't all of the references in these files be to ../shared/devtools/images/* instead of ../shared/devtools/*?

Of course! I just noticed and was building in the wrong directory before.

Nice!  Looks like this will get rid of 44 files and ~200K from the tree.  Let's wait for a green try push before marking checkin-needed just to make sure that it builds on each OS: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=af1a6b5acaa8.

There were some errors in the tests. This should be fixed now. https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=9ed4afe936fd

There is something odd about the way this patch is formatted - linux/jar.mn and windows/jar.mn seem to show up twice (the second changes appear to be the ones that were made to fix the original try push).  It looks like it works, but it makes it harder to review and figure out what is going on.  Assuming you are using Mercurial Queues and have the item on your queue you should be able `hg qref` then upload the patch .hg/patches/my-item where my-item is the name of the item on the queue.

That is indeed quite strange. I have no idea how this got into the patch. I tried again and this time is looks like beeing ok. This is the exact version I pushed to the try servers before.
