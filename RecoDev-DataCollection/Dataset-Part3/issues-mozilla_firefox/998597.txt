nice.
Very nice!
As a nit, I'm not sure about representing *audio* with a musical note ( which might be more appropriate if we had a WebMIDI tool, for example )

Had you also considered something that more represents how audio data is visualized? eg a sine / saw / raw audio wave presentation.
That's true -- maybe something like audio represented in time-domain[1] zoomed in like that (same thing as visualizing sine/saw like Jeff mentioned), or on a more spread out perspective (like you'd see in soundcloud playbacks).

I think that'd be more misleading since we won't be actually playing with waveforms.
That's how the web audio api works, explicitly decoding some audio file (AudioContext#decodeAudioBuffer) into raw audio PCM data (timedomain/waveform) as a signal going from node to node, and all the internal DSP algorithms apply as this format.

This could probably be bikeshedded to death, but I think the music note looks lovely, and if we have something for Web MIDI eventually, can always do a pianoroll/keyboard icon for that or something

Personally I have a strong association between a musical note symbols and a music-creation tool - this tool is *not* about creating music, it's about visualizing pcm data processing. I'd rather have a little up-front discussion now before we commit to something. Invoking the specter of 'bike-shedding' doesn't make me any less right.

Totally agree that midi is more of a piano key thing. Notes for me are about musical notation. I think this would be a great icon if we implemented a score editor, but I don't see any need for that currently.
The music note I'm suggest is the most generic thing to represent music.

Although, it might still be good to experiment with other icons.

That's my only point, this is not a music tool, it is an audio tool.

I would love to see something more representative of a 'sound wave' / 'sine wave' or similar.
Agreeing with Jeff here, main point being this is a general audio tool, not necessarily music. What's the timeline for this look like? Would be lovely to have in Aurora 32 :)

Alternative icon

New one based on feedback. Hope you like it :)
This looks great! Loaded it up for some action shots with different themes and selections: http://i.imgur.com/kQKtLBG.png

It looks a little thin compared to the other icons on my retina MBP, though. If this was slightly thicker, it'd be perfect for me I think -- pinging Jeff on this

f plus if it were a bit thicker :) not sure what the review process is for getting icons landed though

Hawt :) Ship it.
Thanks guys :) Gonna try out a thicker one, and if it looks good enough, I'll create a patch for it :)
This is like christmas, new years and my birthday all rolled into one.

Now that I try it on, even with a thicker version, the icons feels a bit weird next to other icons, maybe for the non-symetric shape, I'll try to make another icon :/ Sorry.

Alternative icon v2

Oh, well, let's just ship it anyway, it's better than the placeholder icon we have.  (we should also have a placeholder icon btw, different from the style editor icon)

Adding patch that adds it to the tool
Also, I think changing the tab title to just "Web Audio" will make it fit in more nicely, the title is huge compared to other ones at the moment.

yes, you should do that.

you need to add this line under the skin/classic/aero directory too.
Added aero entry, name change to "Web Audio" -- not in love with the name, but not sure what else to call it.

Hi, 

reproduced it on Firefox/32.0 ID:20140503030204.

I can confirm the fix in latest Nightly Firefox/32.0 ID:20140520030202: I'm in love with the new icon and the shorter name is good too. :)

Cheers,
Francesca

Ops, just realized I haven't added the platform/os where I verified it: x86_64/Linux (Debian Sid).

And as this was filed against all/all, I'm removing the "verified" status I added with comment 28. Feel free to mark it again as Verified in case the verification against just one os/arch is enough (and sorry for the noise).
Ah, great, thanks Francesca!
