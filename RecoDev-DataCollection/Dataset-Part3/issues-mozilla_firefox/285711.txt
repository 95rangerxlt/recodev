When an alert message pops up, screen reader users do not get a verbal
notification of it.

To reproduce:
Go to http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensiondev/
Use the install link

Notice that the security warning comes up, but no event is fired to indicate
that it has.

We should use ROLE_ALERT to contain the entire alert, and fire EVENT_ALERT when
it pops up.

Can you explain why you left all this code in but #if 0'd?

You should probably have bryner or neil look over your event code.

Thanks I'll bump the UUID. I've left the code in there because we might want to
do something like that at some point, so that the screen reader vendor doesn't
have to iterate through all of the children and speak them or show them on the
Braille display, on this special alert event. It would be better if the screen
reader does do that, if we can get them to do it -- so that buttons and other
UI elements are differentiated from the message itself. I was going to remove
this once I have at least one screen reader vendor doing it on their end.

Even with more context I suggest someone with more familiarity with the code
should review this.

There is a '{' missed in mozilla/toolkit/content/widgets/browser.xml, other
than that, seems good. Please correct before checking in.
