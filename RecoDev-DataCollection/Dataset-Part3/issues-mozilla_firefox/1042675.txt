I followed the instructions on http://arewee10syet.com/ and then visited a site that I know I had blocked using the LeechBlock addon. Firefox then got stuck in loading the site and had to be killed.

Thanks, Sam. I'll update arewee10syet.com's list of addons.

Did the hang affect both the web content and the browser UI? Could you still use Firefox menus and toolbars?
This affected both content and chrome -- I had to kill FF.
Could not reproduce on Nightly 35.0a1, OS X 10.9.4, blocking reddit.com with LeechBlock.

Either it's been fixed, or it doesn't affect Mac.
I can't reproduce either on Nightly 35, Windows 8.1
Thanks for testing, Scott and Matthieu!
