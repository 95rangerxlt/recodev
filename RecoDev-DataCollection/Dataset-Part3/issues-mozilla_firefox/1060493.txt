Gijs pointed me at http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/d728b2f31c56/browser/devtools/framework/ToolboxProcess.jsm#l157 where the debugger toolbox is using the profile service to create a named profile.

This is unnecessary complexity and could potentially affect future plans to change how profile selection works. Instead of this, it would be much better to just create a stable or scratch profile directory to use for the toolbox process.

I recommend creating this as a subdirectory of the "main" profile like this pseudocode:

mkdir <mainprofile>/toolboxprofile
launch the toolbox subprocess with -profile <mainprofile>/toolboxprofile

Then you can also decide exactly how to initialize that profile directory, whether you want it to be persistent or create it fresh on every toolbox launch.

I recommend removing the profileservice from this code.

Maybe a subdirectory of ProfLD would work better?
Fixed as part of bug 1060464.
