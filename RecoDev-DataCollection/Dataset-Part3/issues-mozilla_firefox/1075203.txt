per Philipps comment https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1065441#c3 that a new bug should be created for the Contacts UX review.

Paolo:Hey Philipp, any chance you could look at the Contacts UI that just landed in fx-team? (It's not in mozilla-central yet.) There are probably adjustments to do there as well.

For now the video call button does nothing, and audio/video call context menu items are not active, but the rest should work as expected.

HOLD the review until https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1078309 has landed.  Shell will update the bug and ping UX to let know it's ready.
Updating dependency as discussed, since the alert in bug 1077412 is the only missing UX design piece there, while partitioning the contacts is only relevant when using multiple accounts, which is a bug to be aware about, but with no visual impact.
Shell, this is now unblocked.
https://people.mozilla.org/~dhenein/labs/loop-mvp-spec/#contacts is an interactive site.  import, add, and to the right of the name all show actions.
Madhava has this on the UX backlog now.
Paolo, I'm ready to start reviewing now. Is the current Nightly a good basis for doing the review? If not, it would be great if you could point me to a build that is.

Thanks!

I think the current Nightly is fine. Thanks!

Here's my initial review.
Darrin, it would be great if you could have a look at this. There are a few questions around design decisions in there as well.

These look like the major papercuts to me. Along with these changes, suggesting:

- change 'Import' to 'Google Import'
- add 'No contacts.' when list is empty

Philipp, how should we resource any design work needed as a result (mockup for the contacts empty state, darker icons, etc)?

> - change 'Import' to 'Google Import'

We should use "Import from Google" as 'Google Import' sounds like a product that Google offers

This as well may have some trademark questions since I know they prefer Chrome extensions to use "for Google", "for Chrome", "for YouTube", etc with allowed names for extensions in their store (for example, "YouTube Awesome Player" would get rejected but "Awesome Player for YouTube" wouldn't).

Updated the sheet with new information.

As for resourcing, I'll go ahead and file bugs for all the things we caught here (unless you tell me that those bugs already exist :)
For the trivial ones, I can just include a mockup (e.g. the contacts empty state). Let's see how much work is left after that and funnel it through the backlog process.

Added numbers to the issues to make them easier to reference
Philipp, did you already file the bugs for the issues found? It would be nice if they are marked as blocking this bug.
I did not, since I don't know what is already on file.
What I did do is collect and prioritize the changes in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/spreadsheets/d/1wPKyCxqleZZ6xHcgraH1QFECs5u13gWhE0vQoUh_HwM/edit#gid=0

By Darrins suggestion, I asked Shell to do the bug filing since she has a much better overview of Loop bugs.
Awesome, thanks! Shell, can you make sure that the new bugs are filed and marked as blocking this bug?
Thanks Philipp!!  I'll file bugs today and put as blocking bug 1075203, per Jared's request.
