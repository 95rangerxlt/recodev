The animation inspector panel in the inspector sidebar only allows to play/pause animations for now.

When bug 1110762 and bug 1120339 land, we will have what it takes to add:

- rewind and fast-forward buttons,
- the ability to drag/drop the timeline to set the time,
- a playback rate selection menu (with entries such as 0.1x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x).

Let's make this bug solely about making animations' currentTime settable through the animation inspector.
I'll file another bug for the playback rate.

In patch part 3, on top of adding tests for this new feature, I have:
- moved 2 generic enough frame-script listeners to browser/devtools/shared/frame-script-utils.js (which is our common devtools frame-script),
- gotten rid of CPOWs altogether by removing the getNode function from head.js, and instead, passing selectors to the frame script message listeners when needed.
Also, I have no ideas why reviewboard considers part 3 as discarded ... What happened was I pushed to reviewboard once, realized I missed something, so I discarded the whole review (not just one part, I think), and then pushed again with the changes.
