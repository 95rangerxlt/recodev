Screeenshot of the Preferences window, with the sides cutting through text

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20150305021524

Steps to reproduce:

I use the Tamil Desktop version of Firefox on Mac OSX. I opened Firefox preferences from Main Menu.


Actual results:

The Preferences window cannot be resized and the size of the content inside has been cropped hiding some vital options and buttons. There is no option to scroll either.


Expected results:

The Preferences window should be resizable, or there should be an option to scroll within the preferences window.

Please test the latest beta in a brand new profile, then report back whether it solves the issue. This upcoming version features preferences in a tab rather than a separate window.

The issue is resolved in Firefox 38.0beta in Mac OSX in Tamil Language.

Preferences are in a separate tabs, and no string are cropped.
Some windows still pop up when certain options are selected (Preferences -> Advanced -> Network -> Connection Settings) but the strings are not cropped anymore.

Firefox 38 will be released around May 12. I don't know for certain that it'll have preferences in a tab (the feature may get pushed back to a later version). Either way, I think it's safe to say that's how the issue will be resolved.
