On the latest push to Birch, this test fails twice <https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Birch&rev=99f03d7e749d>.  With patches from bug 816524 and bug 817472, it only fails once: <https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=e38460747ac6>.  Fixing that would turn Birch green on Linux.

This actually seems like a bug that this test is catching.  Patch forthcoming.
