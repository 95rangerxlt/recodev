We called scrollIntoView to make sure the toolbox button was visible in the app manager. But scrollIntoView also scrolls the inner documents, like the toolbox, which messes with everything.

scrollIntoView in the app manager tabs was handy, but it's really not that useful.

And this bug blocks many people (gaia dev using the debugger).

alrighty then.
I just want to add that hunting this bug was epic and hard. I failed to figure out what was wrong, but optimizer, blindly, figured out the whole story. I was impressed.
