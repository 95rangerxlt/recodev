In the migration wizard, the next button state isn't updated after going back.

STR:
 1. Open the migration wizard, choose one of the options and click Next.
 2. Uncheck everything, at this point, the next button becomes disabled
 3. Go back.

-> The wizard goes back, but the next button isn't re-enabled.

This is a regression from bug 307124, sorry for not catching that on review.

this isn't actually a regression, I can reproduce in 1.0.6

There's still one remaining issue with this sequence, which is that unchecking
all, going back, then going forward rechecks everything.  This is because 0 ==
ALL in nsIBrowserProfileMigrator, but its pretty late for an API change here,
but I'll fix that as a followup patch for trunk only.
