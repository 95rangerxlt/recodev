The add-on I wrote in bug 1109713 is a good start on finding all of our unsafe CPOW usage, but we've got an even better tool:

We've got a mountain of mochitest logs that exercise a bunch of the browser, and according to RyanVM, they're chock FULL of of "unsafe CPOW usage" warnings.

We should mine the logs for more places where we use unsafe CPOWs.

Holly could be interesting to look at as well, since it's running all tests on all platforms with e10s enabled.
This was done, and a whole slew of bugs were filed which are all marked blocking bug 1109869.
