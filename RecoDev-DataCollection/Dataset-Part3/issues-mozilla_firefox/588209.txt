Nominating to block Fx 4 final.
When fixing this, please take into account bug 572695, comment #19.
Who owns deciding this URL? Bug 588647 comment 3 suggests "input.mozilla.com/brokensite" but I don't how committed that assertion is. 

Aakash?
The real option is listed in: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=588647#c0

In short, the primary link will be input.mozilla.com/feedback

... the other links, mentioned in the same bug, will be offered off of that page.
I just noticed that the "Submit Feedback..." menu option isn't in the Firefox button help menu. Should it be? If so, I can file a bug and fix it.
Hm, that raises a good point. I don't think we've talked about where to place the Submit Feedback option within the Firefox button menu.

It's under the Help menu on OSX, but I don't think it works there in the Firefox button menu as much as it does underneath or on top of the Help menu. 

I'd like to see it below the Help Menu, but I'm ultimately fine with any option. What do you think, Mike?

In the Help Menu, I think, makes most sense.
I wrote a patch and filed bug 602662.
Well, then, we should make sure the URL allows people to submit happy and sad feedback.
Ok, on it. We can make something up quick, while we build out the real page: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=467460
We'll get it in on Input 1.9 release. Bug is here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=602683
It's up on staging now, we're hoping to release on Thursday. 

http://input.stage.mozilla.com/feedback

Any news? Feedback should contain a link to a single page where the users choose what will send you an evaluation, critical, broken links, web forgery etc.
Yep, it's up on production -> http://input.mozilla.com/en-US/feedback .
Is it possible to get the URL changed over for the menu item for beta 7?
Assigning to Frank to spin up a patch using the URL in comment 15.

We can opportunistically land this on the B7 branch, but I don't think it blocks.
Feedback page is nice, very good. But, in Help menu on FF 4 not implement links for broken website, web forgery?

Broken websites would be reported via the new feedback page. Both happy and sad feedback can take an optional URL field. Broken websites would be the latter.

The web forgery reporting link is still in the main help menu.

Beta 7 will be the long awaited feature freeze, so it would be nice to have the feedback link up and running as intended for it. I agree this doesn't block beta 7 at all, but with the delays it'd be nice to get it, especially because it'd be a trivial patch.
In Minefield beta8pre help menu webforgery link not see. Also, Submit Feedback link is http://input.mozilla.com/en-US/sad . This bug is really blocked beta 8 launched?
The web forgery menu item is in the normal Help menu, but not in the Firefox button's help submenu. If we want it there too, someone should file a new bug.

Yes, we know. That's the point of this bug report.

> This bug is really blocked beta 8 launched?

No, and beta 8 has yet to be launched. Beta 7 isn't even out yet.

Per bug 596201, seems we're removing the client-side URL localization, so this is fine.
