(official zip build)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Tools > DOM Inspector

Result: The first time, you get a broken DOMi window.  The second time, nothing
happens.  The following appears on the JS console:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Invalid ClassID or ContractID"
nsresult: "0x80570017 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CID)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://inspector/content/jsutil/system/file.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 119"
data: no]

DOM Inspector worked fine in the official 11/14 zip build.

Please verify with Seamonkey
The error displayed in the js console has nothing to do with this; it's a known
problem, see bug 189950 comment 10.
So then this is a dupe of bug 189950?
No, it's not a dupe. The error in the js console is an old problem; it was
visible in earlier builds (with a working DOMi) as well. The brokenness of DOMi
(this bug) is a new problem.

patch: inspector needs globalOverlay.xul

Adds globalOverlay.xul to mozilla/toolkit/obsolete/jar.mn.
So why does DOMI work in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US;
rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031114 Firebird/0.7+ but not 11/16?  Did the overlay get removed?

patch: inspector needs globalOverlay.xul

Pierre, this is your regression. Inspector needs globalOverlay.xul.
By the way, you carried over some trailing spaces from toolkit/jar.mn.
taking.
alanjstr: Pierre split up mozilla/tookit/jar.mn in toolkit/content/jar.mn,
toolkit/locale/jar.mn and toolkit/obsolete/jar.mn on 11/14/2003 23:43.
He did not include globalOverlay.xul. Therefore this file is no longer being
packed in toolkit.jar. But inspector needs it.
Thanks for the patch, I also removed the trailing spaces
