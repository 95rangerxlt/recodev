The Windows version of bug 1121340.
We should get this in 37 to get an earlier decision on whether to pursue bug 1115106.
Mark can you take this?

A fairly simple patch given the foundation was already set by the OSX patch.

Note however that as Windows also uses nsIGfxInfo2, Windows builds are going to start reporting the _OSX probes as there was no specific check for OSX in nsSearchService (sadly, I expected the use of nsIGfxInfo2 was a hack for Mac only and Windows would do something different - but I was wrong!)  Thus we should get this landed and uplifted ASAP.

Note to sheriffs - to avoid Aurora recording bad telemetry data, please uplift this patch at the same time as bug 1121340 (but note that this bug depends on that)
