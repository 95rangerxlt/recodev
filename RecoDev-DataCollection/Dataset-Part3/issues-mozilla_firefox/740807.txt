patch v1

In the last weeks the favicon handling code in Panorama grew a lot and it really started to get messy. In fact, there's so much code now that I think it deserves its own file and should no longer remain in the "UI" object.

This depends on bug 728142 as I don't want to let this bitrot just because of some clean up.

I'll remove this line as we can't simply overwrite a getter and we don't need it anyway.
