STR:

1) Visit a site with frames on it in an e10s window
2) Right-click on a frame, and choose "This Frame" then any of "Show Only[...]", "Open Frame in New Tab", "Open Frame in New Window"

This causes some "unsafe CPOW usage" warnings in the Browser Console.

In browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js:

[all from uses of doc.location.href, doc.referrer, or doc.characterSet]

Make context-menu open-frame commands e10s safe (applies before 1075670)

Inconveniently, I made this patch on a slightly old m-c, and after the backout of bug 1075670 it no longer applies cleanly.
Here's one that does.

Make context-menu open-frame commands e10s safe

Clearing review because I need to make a patch with saner naming.  Having frameURL separate from doc.location.href (which is needed for the regular open link) doesn't seem to make sense unless there's a time when we need both.  And thus the frame check if() is probably unnecessary.
Might swap the ordering of the patches as well, or just combine them.
Fixed in Bug 1133577.
