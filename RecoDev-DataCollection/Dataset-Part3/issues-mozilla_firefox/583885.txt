Patch v.1

This test assumes that, at a certain point, there will be 4 annotations on a bookmark and that the 2nd one will be a specific value.

The Weave landing breaks this test, because bookmarks get a GUID at the 2nd position, increasing the count to 5 annotations.

The simple fix for this test is to just have it ensure the values it expects are present, without relying on order.
