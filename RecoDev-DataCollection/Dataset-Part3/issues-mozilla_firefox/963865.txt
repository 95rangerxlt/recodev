The test browser_946320_tabs_from_other_computers.js checks that after simulating a user being signed into Sync, the relevant sync menu items appears.  This user simulation isn't suitable for Firefox Accounts, and thus the test fails.  We'll need to fix this before we can enable Fxa by default.

What exactly goes wrong in fxa? Do you have a try run that demonstrates the problem? There are various sync tests that use a similar pattern...

One day we should invent a testing .jsm that the xpcshell tests can share with the b-c tests, but not this day!
