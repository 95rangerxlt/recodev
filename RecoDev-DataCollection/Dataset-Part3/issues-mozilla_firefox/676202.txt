I know this is trivia, but for some time I've been wondering about changing GCLI to use 2 space indents rather than 4.

The benefits are:
- without this, moving code between Moz and GCLI will break diffs, and I suspect there's going to be quite a bit of this
- It's the most common in non-Moz style guides too - Ace/etc is in the minority here. I went through the top JS style guides (according to Google) and those that mention are more likely to say 2.
- less line wrapping with nested code

The drawbacks are:
- more code churn moving code between Ace and GCLI
- Lots of churn now

We're about to change the license header, which is significant churn, so now is the time to do it. I'm serious this time :)
