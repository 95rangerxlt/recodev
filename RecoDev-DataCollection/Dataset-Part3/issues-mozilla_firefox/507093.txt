http://web-sniffer.net/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bonadresse.com%2Fflist_chambres-hotes-beaune.htm&submit=Submit&http=1.1&gzip=yes&type=GET&uak=0 shows this header:
Content-Type:	text/html (BOM UTF-8)

View -> Page Source shows this line:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />

This is mismatched Encoding instructions from the webserver end. Do

View -> Character Encoding -> Unicode (UTF-8)

to force UTF-8 encoding and the page looks fine.
Enabling HTML5 parser fixed this.
Changing the "Character Encoding" to "Unicode (UTF-8)" solves the problem on Firefox 3.5.1 (Mac OSX).
