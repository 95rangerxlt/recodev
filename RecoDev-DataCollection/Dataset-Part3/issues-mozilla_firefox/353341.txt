shipped-locales file for RC1

We talked about some kind of mini-branching with rhelmer, this is the version for RC1, we'll most likely need to cut that list for fx2.
Just to let everyone know, I added the following 10 locales to the list from Beta2 based on a conversation with Axel:

be - Belarusian
en-ZA - South African English
ga-IN - Gaelic
nr - South Ndebele
pt-BR - Portuguese-Brazillian
ss - Swati
st - South Sotho
tn - Tswana
ts - Tsonga
ve - Venda

This makes 51 locales!  As Axel said, these may not all ship for FF2.  This is meant to be on the generous side as it is easier to pull a few at the end rather than build and test more at the end.
This is probably something I need to care about for tonight's l10n spins. :-)

Final shipped-locales for RC1

This is the same as the original shipped-locales for RC1 with the following two exceptions:  

1) Removed ga-IN which Axel declared not ready
2) Added in the mac platform for pa-IN (removed the stipulation for only Win and Linux).  This is due to testing by a team in India who found the pa-IN MacOS build acceptable.

Final shipped locales for RC1, Take II

This is the same file as timr's version in comment 5, except win32 gu-IN builds were broken for a time, and missed the train for RC1:

This is fine for RC1 given we have an RC2 planned
We want to take the patches for bug 354826, bug 354294 for RC2, we should use revision 1.1.4.9 of shipped-locales.

shipped-locales rev 1.1.4.9

Attaching the actual shipped-locales rev 1.1.4.9 for reference and sign-off by timr.
Axel- I thought you said something about pa-IN being broken.  This was in the L10n-drivers meeting Fri I think.  Maybe I am mixing this up with something else.  Please confirm that the only change should be taking out the african locales and adding back in gu-IN Win32.

pa-IN was fixed in bug 354826. :)
Yep, what reed said.

We morphed bug 354826 from "remove pa-IN" to "fix it", as I got a check-in window after the code freeze, and the fixes were in fact simple enough.

add ga-IE back to shipped-locales

Let's get this addition reviewed by both Tim and schrep, I have mixed feeling of adding back a locale for RC2.

http://litmus.mozilla.org/search_results.cgi?locale=ga-IE has the test results, so independent of the missing RC1, I do think we have traction on ga-IE.

add ga-IE back to shipped-locales

ga-IE is a tier three.  We have previously tested Win and Linux.  We are really just adding back in Mac from a testing perspective.  It shouldn't be a problem.
