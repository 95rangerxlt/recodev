In the code examples for querying Places, it says that a RESULT_TYPE_FOLDER result can be traversed by converting it to a folder by doing the following:

var folder = node.QueryInterface(Ci.nsINavHistoryFolderResultNode);
dump("Folder " + folder.title + " id = " + folder.folderId + "\n");

( http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Places:Query_System#Using_the_results )

However, in every situation I have encountered, Ci.nsINavHistoryFolderResultNode appears to be undefined.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In extension chrome, run this: alert(Components.interfaces.nsINavHistoryFolderResultNode);

Actual Results:  
alerts "undefined"

Expected Results:  
alerts the actual value

That interface was removed in bug 372508 (attachment 264606). Sounds like that documentation needs to be updated.
Yes, this is a documentation bug.

I've updated that page, as well as all other instances of nsINavHistoryFolderResultNode on MDC.

In your example, you don't need to QI that node to anything different, and can use node.title and node.itemId.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
