I feel weird reviewing my own patch, let's get someone else to do it :-)

The patch

I am going to defer this (heh. "defer", get it?) to dcamp since it's a loader thing.
Can you explain why we're doing this?
My original suggestion is in bug 943517 comment 8, but to recap, we want to convert from (sync) sdk promises to (async) Promise.jsm promises, which among other benefits provides a better path forward to ES6 promises. At the same time, we want to make the debugger server not use the mozIJSSubScriptLoader in order to be used for debugging workers (bug 859372). Also, we need to load the promise library in the server's global in order to avoid breaking stepping with chrome debugging.

Pre-loading the promise library in the loader's globals achieves those goals and simplifies upgrading to native promises to a 2-line patch.
