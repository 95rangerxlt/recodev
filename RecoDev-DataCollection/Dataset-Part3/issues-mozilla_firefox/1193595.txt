Based on https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2333, the testing is failing on botio. I think the Firefox version was updated to 41a2 without additional test run, so did not see those failures earlier. I was able to reproduce failures locally and bisected to:

    Bug 1137874 - Create automated tests of the Shumway extension
