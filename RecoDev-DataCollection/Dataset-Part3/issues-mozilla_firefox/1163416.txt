Bug 1163062 made strings localizable, but not this one. Not sure if there are others that I never noticed.
There is also "After restart, a tab will open to input.mozilla.org where you can provide us feedback about your e10s experience."
Correct, I knew I was missing something.

I wouldn't mind taking a look at this if that's okay. It would be my first bug :)

It also looks like  "New Non-e10s Window" needs to be localized in CustomizableWidgets.jsm.
Yep, your help is very welcome! I have assigned the bug to you. Do you know how to edit the source code and compile it? Let me know if you have any questions
Yes I do! Thanks!

That's great, David! Very close to final. Comments below.

BTW, when you post a patch, you generally should already request feedback or review on that patch, as it is easier for someone to notice. Since I think there will be no more changes needed on the next patch, you can already request "review?" from me.

your text editor is probably fixing some leftover whitespace on this file. That is generally a good thing to do, but since this is touching a part of the file that is unrelated to your patch, we generally avoid doing this kind of changes.

Please use the proper comment style as above. A Localization Note is very helpful for people who will do these translations, so you can write a very brief explanation about this string. I think the main important to mention is that this string will appear when the user unchecks the "enable multi-process" checkbox.

Implement code review changes

Hi Felipe, I think I implemented the changes. I was experimenting with the Atom editor for this, and it worked fine, but yes those whitespaces seem to be removed irregardless of what I did. So gedit fixed that!
Felipe - oops, it looks like Atom still attempted to fix some whitespaces in preferences.properties. Until I can configure Atom to *not* do that (or if it's a bug, when it is fixed) I will need to use an older, saner editor! Is it possible for me to edit existing patches, and re-upload them? What's the proper process for re-work?

Implement code review changes

Hi David, thanks for the update! About the whitespace changes done by Atom, that's no problem for your first patch! I'll adjust that when generating the commit for your patch.
David, I see that your author name in the patch is:

david <dvedvick@...>

do you want to use only "david" like that or do you want to change that for the proper commit?
Felipe, I see your point. Use "vedvick", that's a fairly unique name. Thanks.
