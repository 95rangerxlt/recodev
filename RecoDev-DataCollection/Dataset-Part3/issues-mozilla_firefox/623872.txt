bug fix with modified test case

I have attached a patch to fix the described bug.
Fixing the bug caused a regression in a functional test, but assuming this bug is correct, then that functional test case is inaccurate. Thus, I also made a change to the test (included in the patch).

I fixed the author/commit message locally this time, so nothing further needs to be done here - but for future patches please can you take a look at http://blog.bonardo.net/2010/06/22/so-youre-about-to-use-checkin-needed

Thanks :-)
Terry, your patch has now landed on mozilla-inbound, which gets merged roughly daily to mozilla-central. Once that merge happens, the mozilla-central changeset link will be posted here and the fix will be visible in the next day's nightly :-)
