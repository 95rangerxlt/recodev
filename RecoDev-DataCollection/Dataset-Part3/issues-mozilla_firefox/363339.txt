The GP dmg license (browser/branding/unofficial/license.r) is encoded wrongly, leading to buttons like "Save AsÉ" instead of "Save As…" and text like "ÒProductÓ" instead of "“Product”".

My guess is that someone opened the file as UTF-8 and made some corrections and didn't realize the file needed to be MacRoman instead....

Resaved as MacRoman and corrected

I reopened/resaved the file in MacRoman and corrected all the curly quotes and elipses.

I don't have a browser tree to test this, but reopening the final file in Xcode left everything looking correct (some apps like TextWrangler will try to open the file as UTF-8) whereas originally things were fubared.

Mano, are you a good person to review this?  I'm not at all familiar with fx review policies....
