When layering multiple elements on a web page, if one of these elements is displaying an aqua scroll bar, that scroll bar will always display on top of other elements on the page, even if the z-index property of those elements covers up the rest of the scrollable element.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the extjs.com url mentioned above
2. Open the "Grid Window"
3. Open any other window.
4. Resize the Grid Window so that it displays a scrollbar.
5. Attempt to place any other window on top of the scroll bar.
Actual Results:  
The scrollbar always displayed on top of the top-most window.

Expected Results:  
The scrollbar should have been obscured by the higher z-indexed content

I don't have canconfirm status, but have confirmed this bug exists. If you have one absolutely positioned div with overflow set to scroll or auto, the scrollbars of that div will show through any div containers above it even though those div containers have a higher z-index.
