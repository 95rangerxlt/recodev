buttonForward.tooltip and buttonBack.tooltip are unused, haven't checked if there are more.

buttonForward.tooltip and buttonBack.tooltip are unused, haven't checked if there are more.
These may be used by bug 660726.
There's no recent progress in bug 660726. If and when that happens, it should just add the strings back as needed.
I want to solve this bug. How can I start? I'm new here.

Hi Hanna, are you still able to work on this bug?
Is this bug assigned? I'm a newbie and I would like to fix this bug, if it is unassigned yet.

It's currently unassigned.

I am new to bug fixing. What should I know beforehand? (I'm setting up a dev version according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites) What IRC channels should I ask help on?

Thanks.

The #introduction channel on irc.mozilla.org should be a good place for asking for help.
I am interested in contributing to this bug. Where would the unused strings likely be?
you can use dxr (http://dxr.mozilla.org/) to search through the code base, just search for the strings reported in comment 0.
I also pointed to the file in this bug's URL field: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/preferences.dtd
