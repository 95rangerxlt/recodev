I start Firefox like that:

> firefox -P dev -webide  -no-remote  -jsconsole

WebIDE doesn't open:

> Warning: unrecognized command line flag -webide

But, it works when I build WebIDE myself.

I think you need to add the command line handler and its manifest to the package-manifest.in.  See the other DevTools handler[1].

Yes, packaged Firefox works with -webide on Mac with this.  It's impossible to quit the program when started with -webide via either Cmd-Q or the menu item, but that's for a different bug... ;)

Do you know if there's an easy way to fix that?

I don't know, I am not sure what the cause is.  Haven't had time to look at it in depth.  In any case, this patch it still correct and worth landing.
