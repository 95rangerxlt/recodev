1) Start Nightly
2) Ctrl+N for a new window
3) Open several (3+) new tabs in each window
4) Drag the rightmost (though this probably happens for any of them) tab from one window to the other

Expected:
* Tab detaches & is dropped in the new window at the location of the cursor.
* Gap in tab bar on old window is filled by the other tabs moving into the space
* Tabs can be opened/closed/dragged/switched between on both windows without the wrong tab being operated on

Actual:
* Tab doesn't always drop at the correct location on the new window's tab bar
* The old window's tab bar is left with a gap
* Subsequent tab operations (switching, closing etc) occur on the wrong tab

> * Subsequent tab operations (switching, closing etc) occur on the wrong tab

Also: middle mouse click (to close) some of the tabs on either window - you instead sometimes get a new tab opened (as though you had middle clicked on an empty space on the tab bar).

I can't reproduce this. Please file a separate bug if you have STR.

Verified as fixed on Firefox 17 beta 1 - when moving a tab to a different window, there are no gaps left in the other window, the tab can be dropped in the wanted location and the tab operations can be properly done.
