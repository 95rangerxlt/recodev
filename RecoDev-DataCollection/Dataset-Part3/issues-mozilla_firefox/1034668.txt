While working on bug 879008, I noticed that `getMappedSelection` may receive values that span outside the given data range. Theoretically this shouldn't be a problem.

Suppose we have a recording, with the default view:
> graph: start at X1 ... end at Y1
> tree : start at X1 ... end at Y1

However, given a zoomed recording (which still maintains the original data source, but just provides a different view for it):
> graph: start at X2 ... end at Y2
> tree : start at X2 ... end at Y2, with X2 > Y1 and Y2 < Y1
...let's make a selection made via click+drag on the graph, say from X2+n to Y2-m, based on which the tree will be filtered as well. Now, via mousedown+move we can move the selection around (while maintaining its width), the bounds of which will not be clamped to [X2, Y2]. This way, one can end up with a selection spanning from X2-p to Y2-q, and X2-p may be > X1, outside the current zoomed recording bounds, but still in the original dataset.

Hopefully I made myself clear.
