This function in head.js [0] expects certain events to be fired to decide whether or not a requests was performed and received by the frontend. Sometimes, when requests are cached, one or more of those events [1] aren't fired, because there's no corresponding network activity to trigger them.

Disabling cache might fix those types of oranges.
