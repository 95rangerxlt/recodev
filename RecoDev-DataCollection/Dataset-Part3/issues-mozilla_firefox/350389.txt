Session restore doesn't work if empty homepage is specified.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools -> Options -> Main and in Startup section action for "When Minefield starts:" choose "Show my windows and tabs from last time"
2. Remove homepage if you have any
3. Close Firefox (make sure you have at least one tab with content loaded before doing so)
4. Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
Last session isn't restored (empty window).

Expected Results:  
Last session is restored per pref.
Session restore feature shouldn't be affected by having homepage set or not.

Confirmed, I see the same.
It's not a regression from bug 340898, but rather from bug 318639, some weird usage of string bundle APIs there.

This fixes the bogus code in http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js&rev=1.696&mark=4285-4286#4273 and as a bonus appears to fix the reported bug. I didn't read the surrounding code  or test very thoroughly though.
