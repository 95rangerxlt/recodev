The string is imported from IE and is set correctly in the "Automatic Proxy
Configuration" Field, but the radio button is not set, hence the first what a
new user from our company will see is an error because the radio button is still
on "Direct connection". One has to go to the options and select that radio
button to connect to the internet.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FireFox
2. Import Wizard --> Import settings from IE (in the lan settings "use automatic
configuration script" checked and an address is filled in)
3. Start FireFox

Actual Results:  
Can not connect to the internet

Expected Results:  
It should have selected the corresponding radio button, it has already imported
the address string, but not selected it.

I have the same behavior with Firefox 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.0.1.
And from IE 5.5 and IE 6.0, with differents proxy configurations.

It's bad because the first time a new end user try Firefox after using IE, it
doesn't work because of this bug. 
I think the property not setted is : network.proxy.type

In
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/migration/src/nsIEProfileMigrator.cpp
, I have found : 
1840     if (::RegQueryValueEx(key, "ProxyEnable", 0, &type, (LPBYTE)&enabled,
&length) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
1841       if (enabled & 0x1) 
1842         aPrefs->SetIntPref("network.proxy.type", 1);
1843       else
1844         aPrefs->SetIntPref("network.proxy.type", 0);
1845     }

Perhaps there should be a test for type 2 (with automatic proxy from url).

This is an automated message, with ID "auto-resolve01".

This bug has had no comments for a long time. Statistically, we have found that
bug reports that have not been confirmed by a second user after three months are
highly unlikely to be the source of a fix to the code.

While your input is very important to us, our resources are limited and so we
are asking for your help in focussing our efforts. If you can still reproduce
this problem in the latest version of the product (see below for how to obtain a
copy) or, for feature requests, if it's not present in the latest version and
you still believe we should implement it, please visit the URL of this bug
(given at the top of this mail) and add a comment to that effect, giving more
reproduction information if you have it.

If it is not a problem any longer, you need take no action. If this bug is not
changed in any way in the next two weeks, it will be automatically resolved.
Thank you for your help in this matter.

you meant to ask review from mconnor apparently.

Still experiencing this bug in Firefox 1.5.0.3

this looks right, but tossing review over to Gavin to test on a Windows build.

Works fine for me, tested with IE7, direct/manual/PAC.
Thanks for the patch Bevan, and sorry for the delay in getting this reviewed and landed :(
browser/components/migration/src/nsIEProfileMigrator.cpp 1.64
Please pardon my ignorance but how/weher is this patch code (in the attachement) applied to Mozilla Firefox installation?

Thanks
The patch is currently in development versions of Firefox, which will eventually be released as Firefox 3. You can get one at ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk, although you shouldn't expect it to work as well as a release build.
