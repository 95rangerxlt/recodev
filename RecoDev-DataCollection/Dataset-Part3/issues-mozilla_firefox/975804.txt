Now that border image is supported for linear-gradients, I see no reason using background-image instead of border-image.

Where exactly do you want border-image to replace background-image ? They dont even serve the same purpose.

For the sidebar tabs for example. They use background-image to create their border.
Here's a demo I put up : http://jsfiddle.net/ntim/pXQXZ/
This seems like a nice use of border image since we are emulating a border with a second background.  Tim, would you like to work on this?

Sure, but I can't promise you anything since I'm quite busy with school already.
Tim, if it's ok I will assign this bug to me, since I have some time these days and some of the code using background-image was written by me.

bug975804.patch

This patch replaces background-image with border-image in toolbar.inc.css. If I'm not wrong, the files:
- computedview.css
- highlighter.inc.css
- ruleview.css
are also using background-image in places where it could be replaced with border-image. I'm will take a look at them in the following days.

By the way, is it better if I create a different patch for each one of them or one single patch for all four files?

I haven't actually applied the patch to check it out yet, but it does look a lot cleaner.

As for whether to create a different patch for each file or a single patch for all four files I'd say go with a single patch

should this be border-width?

Also, I think it's better to use -moz-border-start: 1px rather than having a special RTL rule.

That's a good point.  Also, you can use this extension to quickly switch to RTL for testing: developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Force_RTL

Probably would want -moz-border-start-width: 1px in this case

Yep :)

Here is the actual link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/force-rtl/
You can use this CSS too :
:root {
  direction: rtl !important;
}

bug975804b.patch

Ok, re-checking my list:
- toolbar.inc.css: I made the changes you said, thank you for the suggestions!
- highlighter.inc.css: The background-image is from .highlighter-nodeinfobar-arrow, I think that's no longer used, right? Should I fill a bug to remove that bunch of CSS?
- ruleview.css: That background-image comes from bug 956044 and it doesn't look like it's replaceable.
- computedview.css: That background-image is like the one from ruleview.css, so I don't think we can replace it with border-image either.

So, am I missing something or the only background-image that could be replaced with border-image was in toolbar.inc.css? I checked all the files from /themes/shared/devtools and I didn't see any other place.

It is still used, it's actually the arrow that points the element from the infobar. But I think there's actually a bug here, the arrow color doesn't match the info bar color, it's very subtle, but noticeable (hsl(210,2%,22%) should be hsl(214,13%,24%)). So yeah, I guess you could file a bug about that, or address that here if Brian is ok with it.

For some reason, it seems that the small separators are a bit lighter than they currently are. But that might just be because I'm using Windows. I actually verified the colors using the eyedropper, they are actually different (#5A6169 for me, #5F7387 in the screenshot).

Oh, true. I will fill a new bug then.

Yeah, sorry. Actually the colors from the screenshot are wrong, because when I took it I had the patch from bug 1049012 applied.

Yes, let's do that in a new bug.

Sounds reasonable.  I think that updating toolbars.inc.css will be a good target for this bug
