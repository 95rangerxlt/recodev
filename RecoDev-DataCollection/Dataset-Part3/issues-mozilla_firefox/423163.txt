Argh, I can indeed reproduce the problem in a sub-folder.
Not sure if I this isn't a duplicate.
Regression window is http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?module=PhoenixTinderbox&date=explicit&mindate=1205516460&maxdate=1205523479
-> Bug 418592.
This should get fixed by bug 423169.

reporter, can you re-check please?
Clearing nom, if bug 423169 didn't fix it, please re-nom.
Marking INVALID as the bug no longer occurrs.
Thanks Andr√©s for confirming.  But I guess this should be fixed (by bug 423169 patch) rather than invalid.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
