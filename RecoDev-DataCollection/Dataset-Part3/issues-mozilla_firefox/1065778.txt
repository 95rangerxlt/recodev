The developer has been contacted through AMO.
I'm the developer of the extension.

I've tested the extension with Firefox 36.0a1, with e10s enabled, and for me it works properly both on Linux and Windows. I couldn't test it with 35.0a1 because on Linux, for some reasons I don't know, I couldn't make work e10s.

Unfortunately I'm not able to test on MAC OSX, so I don't know if there is a specific problem with this OS, sorry.

Could you please try again with 36.0a1?

If it still doesn't work, could you check the broswer console to see if there is some error related to it?

With the nightly and e10s, are you able to launch from the command line a second profile of Firefox using the flag "-no-remote" or "-new-instance"?

Thanks for your collaboration.
Karl: can you please verify whether ProfileSwitcher works with e10s now?
Sorry for the delay -- holidays and such.

Yes, ProfileSwitcher now works with e10s.  Thanks.
