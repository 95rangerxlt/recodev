This is fine with me, although maybe it's better to drop the class="chromeclass-location"?  I don't know.  Maybe Gavin does.  But I don't think it matters much.
I think it would be better to:
1) remove class="chromeclass-location" from the layoutdebug textbox. I suspect it's only there because someone copy/pasted it from a browser window. Opening a layout debug window without the location bar makes no sense.
2) File a bug on making toOpenWindowByType() use a better default feature set (I think "all,dialog=no" makes more sense, and matches the xpfe behavior after bug 136901).

I opened bug 373690 for the toOpenWindowByType enhancement.
