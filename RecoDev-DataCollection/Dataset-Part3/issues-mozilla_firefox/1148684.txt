Bug 1120271 introduced compacting support for SourceBuffer in ImageLib. Unfortunately, the code assumes that if there is only one chunk in the SourceBuffer, it doesn't need to be compacted. In cases where we got a false value for Content-Length, though, that's not true. Bug 1145762 is an example of such a situation.

The fix: we should always compact, even if we only have one chunk.

Compact SourceBuffer even if it contains only one chunk.

Here's the patch. I've verified that this fixes the issue in bug 1145762. (Even
without the GetContentLength fix in bug 1148682.)

Oops, just realized I didn't request review on this.
