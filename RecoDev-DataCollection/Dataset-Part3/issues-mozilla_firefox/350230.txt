The toc position of the "Copying, Saving, and Printing Pages" help topic in the Using Firefox document is wrong.

The toc displays it as the last item of "Navigating Web Pages", but it's a separate item after "Searching".

Broken since 2003 :-(

Also fixes the capitalization of "Searching for Selected Words in a Web Page", to match the doc.

a=schrep for help fix.
Checked in on branch.

As a final note, when resolving some branch conflicts, I discovered that the changed URL is to an element with id="copying_saving_and_printng_pages" (note the "printng" [!?!?] in that string).  Rather than fix it then, I decided to push that to bug 352229 (and most likely leave it as-is on branch), since I don't want to have to deal with the hassle of ensuring all the right places are changed right now.
