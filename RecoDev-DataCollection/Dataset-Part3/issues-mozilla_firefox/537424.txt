I have the latest Apple (Leopard) and Flash updates. Yes, it crashed in safe mode.

THE FIX
Disable Java in Firefox preferences or in add-ons.

Copy MRJ plugin and Java Embedding plugin from Firefox app (show package contents).

Install plugins in (system) /library/internet plugins

These pages will crash FF if Java is enabled in browser:

check/select loop left side to crash

I've spent HOURS trying to figure this out. FYI Safari and Opera never had problems on these pages.

Hope this helps make a foxier Firefox. Thanks to all who tested/replied and tried to help!
