Based on how we use these notifications, this turns out to be less code, and no need to build objects on the fly anymore.

Based on how we use these notifications, this turns out to be less code, and no need to build objects on the fly anymore.
The new function names better reflect what these notifications have actually become.

Note how in the future we may get rid of onDataItemStateChanged entirely, in favor of checks for previous state inside onDataItemChanged in individual views that need them. This means each view would be able to detect only changes in the state it is interested in. This is the model used by the Downloads API.

should use .has() instead of .get()

I'll let Marco's r+ here stand, but I'm just curious about the below change.

Why don't we need to make a differentiation here for private versus non-private downloads anymore?

It happens that "this" is already DownloadsIndicatorData or PrivateDownloadsIndicatorData depending on this._isPrivate. So it was just a longer way to say "let data = this;".
