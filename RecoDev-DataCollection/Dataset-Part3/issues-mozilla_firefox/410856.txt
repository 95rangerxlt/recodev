The URLs displayed in the auto-completion list of the location bar are not visible, they are drawn at the complete right of the list, only the first few characters are visible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a few letters in the location bar text field
2. 
3.
Actual Results:  
The completion list pops up. It displays a list the title of the page that possibly matchs, and tat the far right only the firts 5 characters of the corresponding URLs are visible.

Expected Results:  
The URL for the match should be completely visible. Most times I type a URL, so I try to find a URL (not a mostly uninformative page title). 

I reported on the new completion list before. I thought it was a regression, as the URL was not easily recognizable. Now it has completely vanished. It gets worse and worse with every new beta.

For me (and most trunk users), autocomplete list items appear as two lines, with the title on the first line and the URL on the second line.  I don't know why it would look different for you.  Are you using any Firefox extensions?
The proto theme is broken according to:

Screenshot showing crop problem on takebacktheweb.org theme

Here's what it looks like for me on the GrApple theme from takebacktheweb.org. This doesn't seem to be a Proto problem.
Try the default theme?  Maybe there was a trunk change and *all* third-party themes need to be updated for it.

Screenshot showing menu on default theme

Sure, here's another shot. It has the two-line look again. Interesting. I'm going back to GrApple because I can't stand the default theme personally but hopefully it won't take too long to figure out what's gone wrong here. I use titles as much as I use URLs to search, so I would like to see this resolved. I used to see the dropdown on two lines with GrApple -- I can't say just when it changed on me but it was within the last week.

Shot showing updated GrApple theme with working search list

I just found out that GrApple went up to 0.8.9.4 when I wasn't looking, and I never got an update notification, so I manually updated and the menu works again. Here's another shot. It's worth consideration as a workaround until the Proto theme is working again. This does indeed then look like a problem with Proto after all -- I retract my initial guess.
This was fixed with a Proto update a while back wasn't it?
Yes, this one is fixed now.
