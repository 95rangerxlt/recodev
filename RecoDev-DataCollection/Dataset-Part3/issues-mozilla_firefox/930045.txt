```css
#main-window[customizing] .customization-target

could become

```css
#nav-bar[customizing="true"] > #nav-bar-customization-target

Why not? What happens?

No clue, this selector does not seem to match (at least, not according to the DOM inspector), thus styles are not applied.
This indicates that other selector(s) take precedence and null this out. Unlikely, but this is what I've observed.

Err, no, the CSS rule view displays all matching rules, irrespective of whether they get overridden by later ones.

It's because there isn't a - between 'customization' and 'target' in the id, unlike the class. My mistake in my original suggestion (but then, I assumed that there was consistency). We should probably just make that consistency happen and update any rules currently using #nav-bar-customizationtarget (0 on Windows AFAICT, but maybe there are others elsewhere?)

This wfm
Gijs, can you closely examine the the moment after the enter customization mode animation finishes and after the exit customization mode animation finishes? I notice two distinct 'jumps' at the right and left edges of the window - next to the Menu Panel button, for example.

Not right now, but it'd make sense that you see those, as the toolbar attributes get set later than the transition. So either I should leave those alone in this patch, or we should set the attributes at the same time as the transition.

One of the two... I'd opt for the solution that has the most positive effect on the animations.
