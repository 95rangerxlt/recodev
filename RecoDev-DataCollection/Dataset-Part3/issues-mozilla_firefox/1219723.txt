Per bug 1217472 comment 1, we should be packaging gcli in firefox jar files with the same layout it has in the source tree.
That does not prevent having a shortcut that allows to load gcli via:
  require("gcli/system")

This patch also cleans up Loader.jsm from unecessary devtools/client > resource://devtools/client mapping.
I removed gcli.jsm as it doesn't seem to be used anywhere?

With this patch we can then map gcli to resource://devtools/shared/gcli/source/lib/
And resource://devtools now can be mapping to mozilla-central/devtools/,
at least, regarding gcli...

I think this was kept for add-ons, but then we moved it, so they would be broken now anyway.  I think it's fine to remove, but let's check with :jwalker.

:jwalker, is it safe to remove gcli.jsm?  It appears unused, but I wasn't sure about the details.

Fixed the loader test, we now have only xpcshell-test mapping missing in srcdir-loader.
