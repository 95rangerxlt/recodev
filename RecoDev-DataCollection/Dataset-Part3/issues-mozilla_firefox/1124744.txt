This is completely reproducible for me when I have NoScript 2.6.9.11 enabled in Nightly.
This is the problem of the NoScript addon. 
It is not calling redirect properly.
I don't have NoScript installed and yet this signature crash happened to me on visiting a link from this mozillazine post:

There is 2- 3 separate problems.

Two of them were causing crash Bug 1106396: 99% of the time it was noscript (which I am not interesting in fixing) and 1% of the time another error that I was trying fix, but I do not have a reproducible case.

I checked in a patch that was trying to make this more visible but it made nightly not usable for users using noscript. The patch will be backed out.

And the patch found another error in our code :) This is probably your error Zlip792. 
can you send me crash code to check which error it is :)
Bug 1106396 was backed out in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/60c7f9da3e16 but we'll need to get inbound merged to m-c before this fixes things for Nightly users.

Can you provide a crash report?
(Previous comment)
Definitely Yes.

If you guys want any test for me to run or try test builds, I am good to go. Want Profile or Remote access to Firefox. Do let me know. :-)
Here is a crash report using a new blank profile, with e10s on and with only the development build of HTTPS Everywhere installed.

The crash is 100% reproducible for me by going to www.amazon.com.
I can consistently reproduce this assertion failure on OS X with the Shumway 0.9.3632 add-on enabled (with e10s either on or off):

Assertion failure: mRedirectChannelId == 0 (The redirect must be finished before OnStartRequest is called!), at /builds/slave/m-cen-osx64-ntly-0000000000000/build/src/netwerk/protocol/http/HttpChannelParentListener.cpp:51

the crash depends on e10s being enabled and Noscript installed. I disabled e10s, installed Noscript, and everything was loading fine. I enabled e10s, triggered a restart, and firefox crashed when loading a website. I disabled e10s, triggered a restart, firefox crashed and started using a different named profile.
I'm using multiple versions of firefox each started via the -P option with its own named profile.

Bug 1106396 seems to trigger the crash.
I got this crash 3 or so times rapidly, without any extensions installed, but haven't had any further trouble.

And it was backed out. Should be fixed in the next Nightly.
*** Bug 1124916 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
WFM with todays build on WinXP, E10S enabled, Noscript 2.6.9.11 enabled


BuildID 20150123030203
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/494632b9afed
Fixed?  Should we keep it for tracking any new assertions we might want to add?
I will marked it as fix.
You have already open another bug to investigate redirect in e10s.
