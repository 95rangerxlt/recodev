As part of our pre-release tests, we compare the nightly and release mozconfigs for each platform under $product/config/mozconfigs. The check has been failing for beta builds because the nightly mozconfigs have --disable-profiling, and the release mozconfig doesn't have it. The check doesn't know which is the default, so it's safer to have both mozconfigs contain the same flag.

This probably affects aurora and central as well.

You can use `sed /enable-profiling/d` to delete lines, e.g.:

sed -i /enable-profiling/d browser/config/mozconfigs/linux32/nightly

Comment 0 mentions this affects central as well. Is that just not a problem because "release" mozconfigs aren't used there?

release mozconfigs don't have --enable-profiling in them.
