When opening a bookmark from the library, if the address will cause alert, for example, if there's unrecognized protocol, you cannot get focus back to library. if you minimize the main window, it will keep minimizing and maximizing for a while 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open bookmark library, and create a new bookmark with the address "places:history", or "asdasd:somthing" or anithing else that won't work.
2.double click on it from the library. the main window will get focus, and alert will pop up. 
3.(optional) close the alert, and click on library in the taskbar, or press alt-tab. the library window still won't get focus. 
4.minimize the main window. the main window will start minimizing and maximizing by itself
Actual Results:  
you can't reach library window, and the main window keeps minimizing and maximizing

Expected Results:  
you should be able to get focus for library window

Only after the third click on the taskbar button I can re-focus the Library.

It looks like it is caused by Bug 232605.
The problem looks the same now as on 13 Oct 2006, although there was a time (second quarter of 2007) that it was so bad that it was impossible to focus the Bookmarks window.

Hm, this means that creating a bookmark and entering a typo can result in a pretty horrible state.

Gavin: any ideas?

This seems to be the crux. Opening that same bookmark from the location bar or the bookmark sidebar, menus, or toolbars doesn't cause the issue. For that reason, I don't think this blocks.

Gavin, renominate if you don't think we could take this sort of fix on branch.
I should also note the workarounds:
 - window stops minimizing/maximizing after a few seconds
 - right click on the "Library" entry on the taskbar and close it - everything's fine after it re-opens
Given the workarounds, not going to hold the 3.1 release for this.
Looks like it works on trunk now. (maybe has to do with  Bug 499816 ?)
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
