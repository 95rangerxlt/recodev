when all windows are closed you have to open a new window before thee [apple+l]
shortcut will function.  [apple+l] should spawn a new window if  there are no
windows currently open.  Also [shift+apple+l] fails to spawn a new window after
URL completion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close all windows
2.press [apple+L] on keyboard - no window will span
3.press [shift+apple+L] on keyboard
4.a URL location dialog will appear
5.enter URL and press enter - no new window will spawn

Actual Results:  
no new window spawns

Expected Results:  
spawn a new window

reporter, this is a build nearly two months old

please download a current build from
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/nightly/latest-trunk/ and test again.  I
assume that you're saying that when all windows are closed, the firebird process
is still running?
Downloaded latest build from link specified.  <Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; 
en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030709 Mozilla Firebird/0.6>  Issue still remains.  You are correct, you 
are correct that Firebird process is still running.  In Mac OS applications do not quit when their 
windows are closed.
i can confirm that command-l does not open a new window.  however, i am not sure
what the appropriate behavior should be.  in mozilla seamonkey 1.4, command-l
does not open a new window.  in safari 1.0, command-l does open a new window.

is it weird to have three browsers in your dock?  i think so. :)
Reporter,  does Camino support this behaviour?  That project is more focued on
working as a true Mac OS X app, where Firebird is cross-platform and not really
customized for each platform.

Confirming as a feature request and tweaking summary, although as this may
likely be WONTFIXed.
camino opens a new window on command-l.  IE mac also opens a new window.  god, i
have entirely too many browsers.
reassigning mac bugs, sorry for the spam.

Yes, Firebird should open a new window on Cmd+L and focus the URL bar.

err, explain to me why this is critical and not rfe?  at most this should be major.
-> me. 
Anndddd... fixed.

Thank you kindly...
Yes, it is important as end users get confused when an application
is running, but there are no visible windows.

I have had to refrain from rolling out Firebird for this very reason.

A related (and more serious) point is that clicking on the icon
in the dock should open a new window, if there are none visible.

Last time I checked, Mozilla did this, and Camino does too. If
you give me hint as to where to start, I will submit a patch.

Ben Fowler, you're talking about bug 204484 - there's information in the bug
about where to start.  Best of luck with that!
