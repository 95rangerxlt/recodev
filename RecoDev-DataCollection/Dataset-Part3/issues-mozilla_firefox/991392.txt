In bug 917226, I "fixed" what I thought was a typo in debugger.xul:

> <splitter class="devtools-horizontal-splitter devtools-invisible splitter"/>

Notice the space between "invisible" and "splitter". The actual class name is "devtools-invisible-splitter", so I changed it to:

> <splitter class="devtools-horizontal-splitter devtools-invisible-splitter"/>

However, upon investigation, we actually want it to be visible, so the previous typo was, in fact, allowing the expected visibility on that splitter :)

Heh.

I had to back this out (along with the other patches in that push) in https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/a192ea8b6fce for causing browser-chrome-1 tests to start leaking by adding tests, which pushed other tests into a different chunk, making them leak.
The patch in this bug doesn't have tests, so the reasoning that it can cause bc-1 tests to start leading by "adding tests" is false.

Relanded: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/a6745130dded
