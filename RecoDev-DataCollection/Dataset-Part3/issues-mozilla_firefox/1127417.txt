Hello, to get started first take a look at https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/GetInvolved for some information and resources about working on DevTools.

Once you are ready to start pulling down the code, follow the instructions at https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking#First_Build.  Feel free to hop onto the #devtools IRC channel and ask if you have any issues getting started up.
Once you get a build running, the patch itself should be pretty simple.  The hard part is going to be getting your development environment set up and then learning how to build and submit a patch: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_generate_a_patch_for_somebody_else_to_check-in_for_me.3F.


We will just need a line like this near the top of the file with any other consts:

const ELLIPSIS = Services.prefs.getComplexValue("intl.ellipsis", Ci.nsIPrefLocalizedString).data;

And then just replace the hardcoded "…" with ELLIPSIS.

This isn't quite right (see inline comments for what needs to change).  You can test your changes on a page like: http://jsbin.com/yubaniseze/1.  Inspect the div with the really long text content and expand it in the markup view - you should see the ellipses in this case.

You need to replace the "…" here with ELLIPSIS, and just remove the line with the comment.
sorry for check-in ...will changing code right now ..
brian ,can you please explain what do you mean by "nspect the div with the really long text content and expand it in the markup view".

Open this in a tab: http://jsbin.com/yubaniseze/1.  Then right click on the text and say Inspect Element.  Notice that a <div> gets highlighted in the markup view.  Now expand this div in devtools by clicking on the triangle to the left of it.  See the "..." at the end of it and how it cuts off the text of the element?  This is the string that we want to update.

So you can test that you are changing the right thing by modifying that string to something else and see if it is reflected in your build.  Once you know you are changing the right thing, just swap it out with ELLIPSIS.
Brian,Thanx

This should remain += so we don't end up overwriting the actual text

This is the expected behavior :).  The patch looks good, pushed it to the test servers: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=fb42294b4353
