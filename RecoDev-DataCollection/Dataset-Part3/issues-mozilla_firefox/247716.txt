Depending on the website I'm on - hitting the space key in the middle of my
Find-As-You-Type string either stops the search in its tracks, or it just simply
does not register. 


For example, if I'm on www.betanews.com - as soon as I type a space in my
string, I get "Find Stopped". 

On the other hand, if I'm on http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en, if I
type a space as part of my string, it just gets ignored - so that if I'm trying
to type "return results", it gets entered as "returnresults".


This makes it impossible to use this feature for phrases, which is important for
it to have decent functionality on large or complex pages.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to any website
2.  Making sure that you don't have a cursor within a textbox field, start
typing a phrase you see on the page - all you need is two words seperated with a
space

Actual Results:  
Depending on the website, you will see that once you hit the space key, your
search is either halted in its tracks, or the space doesn't register - leaving
you with your two words melded together (i.e.  (mozillafirefox")


Expected Results:  
It should have processed the space as part of the phrase, so that if I'm looking
for "windows theme", it will find that entire phrase instead of just limiting me
to the first word "windows", which is practically useless for large and/or
complex pages.

If this bug is occuring because the Space key is given an additional function
(such as Page Down scrolling) - than an easy workaround is to let FireFox
recognize when the space key is not the FIRST key pressed.

After all, if the space key is pressed first, FireFox can scroll the page as
usual.  But if it's in the middle of a Find-As-You-Type session, it should
process the space as part of the phrase - and not halt or make unuseable the
Find-As-You-Type session.

www.betanews.com WFM with FX 0.9

however, i did notice that the find as you type started at the bottom of the
page and did not wrap around like i think it should.  that may be another bug

WFM with 0.9 final, might be a specific site bug.
I have yet to get this to work on *any* site.  And this was my very first 
install of FireFox (so there were no remnants from a previous version).

So, I find it interesting that others haven't duplicated this yet.  Is there 
any chance that this happens only with certain Preferences configured?
I tracked down the issue.  The problem is the SuperScroll Extension.  It 
causes this problem, and a number of others all related to the space key.

Sorry, guys, for the false alarm!  :)
