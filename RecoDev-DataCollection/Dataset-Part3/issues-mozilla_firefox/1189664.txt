Take a fast shortcut when searching for BreakpointActors and the map is empty
I remember removing this code because it seemed like a pointless micro-optimization. I am amazed that it actually makes so big a difference. Any theories as to why?
My theory is that generators are very slow... I think they still don't even make it into Ion.

But yeah, not really sure what was up but this saved a couple hundred ms of jank.
