I'm not the right reviewer for this. Build config is what your looking for -

Leon,

You should add the original author of this code to review
this patch, because the -s option has the opposite effect
of -b.

It is correct that the -b option is non-portable.  The
Single Unix Specification Version 3 only specifies the
-l and -s options for cmp:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cmp.html

The cmp(1) man page on Linux says -b means "Print differing bytes",
and -s means "Output nothing; yield exit status only."  Unless
I know the intention of the original author, I don't know if
what the correct fix is (simply removing -b, or replacing -b
by -s).

r=wtc.

OK, I found the checkin that added the code that uses
cmp -b:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/332c6aaee89c/configure.in

It's clearly a copy of another piece of code, which uses
cmp -s.  So I think this patch is correct.

Kairo may want to review this, too.

Thanks for catching this, apparently the -b option is GNU-specific or something like that and it may just have slipped in when testing different approaches to the problem.
This should go into 1.9.1 as well, by the way.
