When switching lightweight themes gets integrated into customization mode, we'd like to pre-populate the menu with five hand-picked themes that look great while not sacrificing legibility.

The purpose of this bug is to
a) nominate themes from AMO that would be suitable
b) see if we need/want to design some themes ourselves.

Below are 5 themes we picked. Also there is a list of themes that work well with Australis in this etherpad: https://firefox-ux.etherpad.mozilla.org/Themes It would be nice to show different themes if the user clicks on the themes button again. In general we should always have a light one, a dark one, a colorful one, and one related to Firefox. For example, we can switch "Pastel Gradient" to anything under "Rainbow" in the etherad or switch "Space Fantasy" to anything under "space".

1. Carbon-light https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/carbon-light/
2. Pastel gradient https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pastel-gradient/
3. Linen light https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linen-light/
4. Space Fantasy https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/space-fantasy/
5. A web browser renaissance https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/a-web-browser-renaissance/?src=ss
Forgot to add, but we should probably always have the default theme as the first item in the button.
