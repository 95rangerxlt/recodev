Did the recent placeholder work (right before landing) resolve this? I'm not sure what this is describing.

So when you drag items, there's dotted-outline placeholders at the bottom of the menupanel. They are not quite aligned with the other items, and this also means if you drag items onto them (and the dragging code makes those items take the positions of the placeholders) they get misaligned as well. It's not super-obvious, and once you drop things go back to normal, so maybe P4 rather than P3. All part of a larger issue with alignments in that panel that we need to sort out...
