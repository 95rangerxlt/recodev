support history in share panel

Facebook share panel recently broke, the panel no longer closes when the user cancels or completes a share.  Examination of the facebook code shows that history.back() is called prior to window.close().  Since the share panel uses an iframe, the history object is not available, an exception is thrown, and window.close is never called.

The intention with the share panel is that existing share dialogs provided by many sites will work unchanged, however, all socialapi panels intentionally used iframe, in part, to avoid history being added to the places database.  For the share panel to work with share dialogs unchanged, we'll need to be sure we support normal web/js APIs that would otherwise be available.

The easy fix is to use the browser element and remove history for that browser when share is done.

tests for history support (which broke the tests if the fixes were not applied) as well as testing that global history is not retained (ie. share.html is not in history after tests)
