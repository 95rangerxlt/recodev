When adding a bookmark separator, either by using the File | New Separator menu
item, or by clicking New Separator in the Bookmarks Manager toolbar, a
Properties dialog box appears unexpectedly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
 1. Open the Bookmarks Manager window by choosing Manage Bookmarks in
    the Bookmarks menu.

 2. (Optional) Click on a bookmark item where the separator is to be
    inserted in its place. 

 3. Click on New Separator, or choose New Separator from the File
    menu.
Actual Results:  
The Properties dialog box for the bookmark separator appears.

Expected Results:  
The bookmark separator should appear immediately, without any request for user
input; such is the behaviour in Mozilla.  No dialog box should be expected nor
displayed, as suggested by the absence of the ellipsis in the "New Separator"
command.

A name for a bookmark separator is optional.  As consistent with the behaviour
in Mozilla, the user should not have to be prompted for the name associated with
the separator when it is being inserted.

pch, I can confirm this, and with some help from Jesse and Ave on IRC I can now
confirm this regressed since 0.7

looking at checkins in that timeframe

quick one-liner

Pierre, I know you turned this on on purpose, however I feel that for
separators, while the feature is useful to some, being prompted every single
time will be an annoyance to those who don't use separator labels.

in a bit of an impromptu discussion on IRC, even people who use the labels
don't think it should be prompting on every occasion.

If this is a "feature" it sucks big time.

Who *names* his separators? Why?

Can this "feature" be removed please?

TIA
In case this was meant as a feature: Changing the behavior of "new seperator",
which worked in a certain way for 8+ years really confused the heck out of this
user. And, not wanting to name the separator, "Cancel" was my initial reaction
to the dialog, which deletes the separator, and adds 'Undo delete bookmark' to
the undo stack, scaring the absolute crap out of me. (As a large bookmark folder
was selected).

Please revert behavior. This should have never made a release... unfortunately
the last build I was testing with looks like it was right before this change. :(

There's been a patch here for over a month. Pierre, please take a look ASAP.
Actually, I find this behaviour of the appearing Properties box very useful.
This of course depends on the effect of a Separator name. That's why I think
this is related Bug 208017: I agree that without the Separator name shown in the
Bookmarks menu the box is kind of useless. But if that would be fixed, the
properties dialog would make sense.
Fixed on branch alongside bug 246431.  Still need to fix this on the trunk when
it opens.
Adding fixed-aviary1.0 keyword per comment #6
Fixed on trunk and branch.  (The trunk was open when I checked in - honest!)
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
