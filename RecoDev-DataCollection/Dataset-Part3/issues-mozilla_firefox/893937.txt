Honza, can you test this again with tomorrow's Nightly build? The patch for bug 893424 should have fixed it.
If Ed's push from Bug 893424 Comment 4 is fixing this issue you can test on following build which was landed after that push.

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013/07/2013-07-16-03-02-02-mozilla-central/
Should be fixed by bug 893424. Please reopen if you can still reproduce it.
Let QA do this please.
