v1

I feel bad about this - I put the loader in gDevTools.jsm in browser, but it clearly belongs in toolkit where it can be used to load the debugger server too.

v2.1

v2 is v1 with orange fixes (just s/gDevtools.jsm/Loader.jsm/ in a few missed places).

v2 fixes some references to gDevTools from Loader.jsm.

I'm going to stop using bugzilla and mercurial today.

Fix typos

I don't know why no tests failed, but I can't open the tools locally without this patch.

My theory was that the test harness had somehow loaded the missing libraries by the time the devtools tests ran, but check this out: my Lion build of fx-team tip (on my 2nd PC) had no problems running even without my fix!

Sometimes I really hate computers.
