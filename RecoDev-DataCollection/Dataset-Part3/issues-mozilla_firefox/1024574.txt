If I run xpcshell on a single test file, it used to show the RDP logs. Not they don't. past help me fix this in head_dbg.js by moving the `Services.prefs.setBoolPref("devtools.debugger.log", true);` statement up a few lines, but I don't know if that's a permanent fix or if there's something better we can do to fix it.

self-reviewed?
I actually said r=me on IRC, but in the team we also have an agreement to land test-only fixes even without an additional review.
