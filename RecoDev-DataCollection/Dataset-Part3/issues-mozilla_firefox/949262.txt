Steps to reproduce:
1) Open Developer Tools (control-shift-K).
2) Click the Scratchpad icon.
3) In the Scratchpad type "alert(1)" and click "Run".
4) Click the "x" with the tool tip "Close Developer Tools".
5) Click "Run" in the Scratchpad window.
6) Select the main window and reopen developer tools.
7) Click "Run" in the Scratchpad window.

Expected result:
- An alert box containing "1" appears in steps 3, 5, and 7.

Actual result:
- The alert only appears in step 3.

After closing the developer tools the operations in the Scratchpad fail to work, but the button have the same appearance and the right-click menu with operations still appears.

The Scratchpad should either continue to work, or the buttons and menus should be changed so they appear disabled and don't react to being clicked or selected.

To be honest I'm surprised this has been open for 6 months, it's an extremely annoying paper cut for me.
I wonder if I broke this with bug 920794 or something. :-\
This should not be a papercut
The following error appears in the terminal:

A coding exception was thrown in a Promise resolution callback.

Even though Scratchpad can share the toolbox's client, it doesn't properly handle the disappearance of that client and the acquisition of a new one. It should probably register a toolbox-destroyed listener and switch implementations.

The changes look good, but you don't think this warrants a test? Will defer to you on that.

Remove closed connection targets from scratchpad and request a new one on evaluation v2

I was on the fence about the need for a test, but since you wonder about it too, let's add one to be sure. It turned out nice and simple too, if I say so myself.
