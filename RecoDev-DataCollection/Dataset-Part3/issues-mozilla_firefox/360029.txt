Initial goal for Places in Firefox 3 is to build the existing UI components on top of the new backend. This means that the link to the old Places UI is obsolete, and needs to be removed. We'll figure out what/where should link to the bookmarks organizer during Fx3 planning, if different from the bookmarks menu.

Don't forget to kill the "Star (On|Off)" toolbar button while you're in the neighborhood.

work in progress

I'm not entirely sure if this is the right bug for this, but it seemed the closest I could find.  This is a work-in-progress to remove the Star and add back View->Sidebar->Bookmarks.  Currently the biggest problem is that I can't get the text-search to work.  Anything I type just blanks the whole tree.  I was having some weird searching problems in the Organize Bookmarks dialog too, though, so I'm not sure if the problem is on mind end or not.  Feedback/help strongly desired. :-)

I gave your patch a read, it looks good for the most part (and similar to mine in bug 362292 in spirit).

One thing:  I don't want us to have a different chrome uri for the places sidebar vs the old one.  So I set up browser/components/places/jar.mn to provide the old uri.  So this is not needed:

+#ifndef MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARKS
                  type="checkbox" group="sidebar" sidebarurl="chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksPanel.xul"
+#else
+                 type="checkbox" group="sidebar" sidebarurl="chrome://browser/content/places/bookmarks-panel.xul"
+#endif


The root of the tree we're using is also different.

Otherwise, nothing really pops out to me as wrong.  I'm going to put up a new patch on the sidebar bug which should look a little better soon.

This is included in jminta's patch, but is only the part concerning this bug.

Jminta, would you like to take this bug? or should I?

Feel free to take it.  I'm heading on vacation for the weekend anyway.
Note: I combined these patches because I didn't think we should remove the Places icon until there was a replacement sidebar ready, otherwise a fair bit of functionality is lost.

Remove places toolbar button

thunder!  sorry for the delay, thanks for being patient.

the code removal looks good, but there are going to be some entities, a js function (togglePlacesPopup()), and some css rules that are no longer needed.

can you double check that they are no longer needed (after you remove this button) and submit a new patch?

Oops, I missed the dtd and the properties files.
Here's another patch that removes those.

I like the poetry of keeping "_placesPopup: null," as the only popup remnant, but is poetry really enough of a reason to keep it?
Also, http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css#1355 and http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser/browser.css#1209 which would then leave the fish eating a bubble browser/themes/(win|pin)stripe/browser/places/placesIcon.png unused
phil, thanks for listing the extra things that need removing.  

I'll remove them in my local tree before checking in for dan.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
