Patch

This fixes a few things with D&D in bookmarks. There are still some other issues, especially if there are multiple levels of trees. I don't understand the D&D architecture enough to do this efficiently.

Ben: I don't understand the use of _self in getSupportedFlavours. It was undefined so I removed it and everything still worked.

Patch

r=ben@mozilla.org but fix the result.queryOptions line (where is result defined?) and prefer LOG() to dump() in places code.
On 1.8 branch and trunk
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
