On my last cvs check-out, I see both LTR and RTL Feed logos, which are more annoying than useful.  Please just make it consistant.  It's not so important to have them reversed.

I'm going to attach an screenshot.

i agree, it's inconsistent.
Jay, we need a RTL version of the livebookmark(s) icon with just the dropmarker on the other side (i.e. without flipping the feed icon itself)

Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).
