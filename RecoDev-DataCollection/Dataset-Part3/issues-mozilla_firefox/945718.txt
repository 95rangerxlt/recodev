With the landing of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=939943 to fix the confusion on closing the Customize Panel, the text Labels for 'Help' and 'Exit' are now missing. 

The 'question mark' should have a label 'Help' or at least a tool-tip on hover showing that its a 'Help' button.

Same with the 'X' Should have a label 'Exit' or a least a tool-tip on hover.

I don't know much accessablity readers, but someone who is sight-impaired would not be alerted I suspect on how to get help or close browser. 

All other Icons in the Menu-panel have Tool-tips on hover.

The text labels were intentionally removed, but we can add the tooltips here.
P3 only because of 'Exit' being rather deadly, and now unlabeled and looking like any generic 'close' icon (see also bug 940475)

This looks fine. Do you think we need a tooltip for the customization mode button? I would imagine so...

::: browser/components/customizableui/content/panelUI.inc.xul
@@ +16,5 @@
>  
>        <footer id="PanelUI-footer">
>          <!-- The parentNode is used so that the footer is presented as the anchor
>               instead of just the button being the anchor. -->
>          <toolbarbutton id="PanelUI-customize" label="&appMenuCustomize.label;"

Do you think we need a tooltip for this one too?
I don't think so, because the tooltip would end up being the same as the visible label.
