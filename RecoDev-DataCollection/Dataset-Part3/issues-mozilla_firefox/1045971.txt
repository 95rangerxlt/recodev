Build ID: 20140729030202

Steps to reproduce:

STR:
Install HTTPS Everywhere, 5.0developement.0
Open E10 tab
Go to Bugzilla or any other site that HTTPS Everywhere has a Rule for
Go to the HTTPS Everywhere toolbar button, click to view drop-down


Actual results:

The HTTPS Everywhere button doesn't show the number of active Rules on the button or list them in the drop-down.


Expected results:

With Bugzilla, the addon icon should show that 1 Rule is active, listed as Mozilla in the drop-down.

alreiten, thanks for testing. I'll update our list of add-ons.
Yan: hi! \o

Allison: HTTPS Everywhere is using nsILoadContext.associatedWindow. Is that something you plan to shim (for SPDY Indicator bug 1041139?)

Jacob is the new maintainer of HTTPS Everywhere.
IIRC, we managed to get the drop-down menu to show the applicable rules only for favicons and other requests that were visible to the Chrome process: https://github.com/diracdeltas/https-everywhere/tree/electrolysis.
I think this should be fixed by https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/pull/526.
With the new 5.0developement.1 build of HTTPS Everywhere, this issue seems to be fixed.

Thanks for testing, alreitan. Works for me, too.
