Good for a workaround, but we should figure out the original issue,
I'm going to verify if it is due to bug 673569.
That's quite impressive if child.js is the only one suffering from such regression!

Paul, did you see this issue with the 2013-12-18 Keon nightly?  I was hoping to reproduce this for my own testing of other server changes, but I am able to connect and debug an app successfully.

What version did you use and what steps did you perform?
Never mind, I misread timestamps.  Looks like bug 673569 is not yet in the Keon nightlies.
