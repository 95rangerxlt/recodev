Similar Bugs have been submitted before, but this feature has been working for
some time (Gecko/20040116 Firebird/0.8.0+ *does* work), and is now broken again.
if I so it broke between 01/16 and 01/18?  does 01/17 work?
I looked into it:
The first nightly with the bug: Gecko/20040117 Firebird/0.8.0+
No, 01/17 does not work (i.e. it was the first build that introduced the problem.)
Seems that this is the checking that busted it:

*** Bug 231392 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Confirming based on comments and dupe.
please test this on tomorrow's nightly, it loks like fallout from bug 224578,
and those issues have been fixed as of now.
Although it is the thing built by myself from CVS, command+<key> is working by
bug224578 fix.

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; ja-JP; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040119
Firebird/0.8.0+
Yes, it's been fixed as of the 11/19 nightly.
Does this fix also fix mozilla suite? Seems like it also has the same problem:
bug 231421
Both of the following builds work:
[firebird:]
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/nightly/2004-01-19-02-trunk/
[seamonkey:]
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/2004-01-19-05-trunk/

I resolved the bug as fixed.
