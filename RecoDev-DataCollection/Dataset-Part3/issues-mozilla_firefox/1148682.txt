Right now moz-icon channels return a bogus content length. At least one implementation returns uninitialized memory despite yielding a status of NS_OK.

We should either return the correct content length, or just signal failure.

Handle content length correctly for moz-icon channels.

OK, it doesn't seem trivial to get the correct content length here, and it's not
really very important in the end for these tiny icons, so on the platforms where
GetContentLength is not just forwarded to an underlying channel, I've taken the
approach of removing mContentLength and returning NS_ERROR_FAILURE.

On the platforms where GetContentLength *is* just forwarded to an underlying
channel, we don't need to do anything. That's why this patch only touches the OS
X and Windows implementations.

Try job for the two affected platforms here:

I've verified that this fixes the issue in bug 1145762.

Hmm, moz-git-tools does not seem to be setting the review flag for me...

Do we need to implement GetContentLength at all? Can we just delete them and let whatever the parent class does?

I think we do for these platforms. The other platforms forward to an underlying channel, but on OS X and Windows we don't have that option.
