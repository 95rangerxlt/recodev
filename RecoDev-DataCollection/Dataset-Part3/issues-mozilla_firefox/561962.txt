When starting FF you really never know when the Software Security Device window shows up. If you for example check mail (on different desktop i Spaces) or change prefs i FF and the Software Security Device window shows up - FF and OSX freezes. Only way out is force quit FF if you get in contact with Finder - otherwise restart computer.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce




The Software Security Device window should be the first thing showing up when starting FF.

Problem solved in Firefox 3.6.6.

The Software Security Device window only appears when needed on a site.
