I don't think this bug is security sensitive, but we should definitely fix it, by ensuring that broadcasts from private windows are sandboxed from non-private ones, and vice versa.

Andrea, do you have cycles for this?

This looks mostly good, but I don't understand this part.  Why are you dropping the channel argument here?

because this object doesn't use it. So why have it as argument?

I promise I'll write a mochitest. I tried but I'm having problems to have 2 windows opened at the same time and keep 2 broadcastchannel objects alive at the same time.
The test will come in a separate patch.

should be in 38b2

Minusing this for bounty because it is a low rated security issue.
If bug 966439 is the regressor, this is Firefox 38 and higher only, isn't it?
As in, we never shipped this publicly in Firefox 37...

Yes, correct.
As far as I investigated, The BroadcastChannel API is available from Firefox 38+.
It cannot be activated in Firefox 37 and there seems not to be any flags for enabling it in about:config.
Thanks.
