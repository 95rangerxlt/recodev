As follow-up to bug 243893, comment 26 ...

Case 2 (FFx gets a request to open a link in a new tab when a chrome-restricted
window is the most recent FFx window) is still to be dealt with. In this case,
the user will expect a new tab in a fully chromed browser, but currently will
get a new tab in a chrome-restricted pop-up with no tabstrip. Con-fu-sing! (This
happens a lot in singleWindowMode)

As such, I recommend that we:
 1. try to find the most recently used chromed window and open the tab there
 2. if no such window exists, open a new chromed window with the link in it

better fix

This has the semi-intentional side effect of skipping windows with collapsed
toolbars on Mac, but beltzner and I figured that made the most sense with the
available options.
Fixed.
