One potential cause of this is if you've deleted chrome.rdf in your profile (see
Bug 230558). If that's the case then you can usually get the file to be properly
recreated by deleting the registry.dat file in your Phoenix folder.


delete the registry.dat file and Firefox will rebuild the chrome.rdf file which
has solved this problem very nicely.
