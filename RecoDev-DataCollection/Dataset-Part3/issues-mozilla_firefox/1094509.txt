I'm sure this will need some UX love, but here is what I am thinking as far as implementation.  Try push: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a7f196da4dee
In both the dark and light theme the bottom border of the current tab extends 2 pixels down into the URB bar. This stands out a lot more in the light theme due to the greater contrast between the bottom border of the current tab and the url bar background. I wonder if we should desaturate the bottom border of the current tab?

f+ on the code for the CSS bits. I've not done a visual review - you showed me a screenshot yesterday, and it looked fine at a glance; it'd be good to get this checked on our 3 primary OSes by some folks, as well as getting UX to look at styling.

Not sure the last two pref switches and testing here add testing coverage? Seems we do the same thing twice now, might as well leave the second half out?

Thanks, I'm going to ask for feedback with the knowledge that we won't land anything until it goes through further UX testing, and we will go through another review at that point.  I haven't looked closer at comment 2 yet, for instance.  But I'm going to next test this with the changes from 1094138.

Should I make this more specific - targetting only the URL bar and search bar?  It's definitely needed for those, and I'm not sure if there are any other selectable bits up there.

It wasn't actually applying without it, but I should have done some more research about it.  Basically, there is a specific rule that tells this to inherit on OSX (http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#3059), and in the dark lw theme, --chrome-color was the same as --tab-selection-color so I never noticed that it wasn't actually working.  I could alternatively update the selector to match: .tabbrowser-tab[selected=true]:not(:-moz-lwtheme).

It just works based on http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/devedition.inc.css#202.  I guess that is a little confusing though since the other OSes have special rules.

There aren't by default. There would be add-ons to consider, but then, I think you're only styling the url bar and search bar in terms of background color anyway, aren't you? In which case, this should use the same selector. Keep in mind those were updated by https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/4d284c7760bf .

No, in that case this is probably clearer, but a comment would help.

Er, wrong link? The quoted patch code here is about back/fwd buttons; the link is about the tab scroll buttons. Or am I missing something?

I wonder if this shouldn't be using the same styling as australis... but I guess this works, too.

FWIW, neither this or the dark theme do what australis does in having it not be a straight opaque line, meaning it looks odd if you enable the bookmarks toolbar (this is why we have the fade-out at the top and bottom). Might adjust that while we're here, if you feel like it? :-)

Ah you are right, nice catch.  I've added that back.

It's the .tabbrowser-tab:hover in taht rule.

A new screenshot - would love any ux feedback.  Here is a try build: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=3de54db1c22d
Created attachment 8518600
toggle-light-devedition.patch

Rebased and also changed the box shadow on navbar from `0 -1px var(--chrome-navigator-toolbox-separator-color)` to `0 1px var(--chrome-nav-bar-separator-color)`.  After a discussion with MattN, I think that is what was causing the 'overlap' Joe is talking about in Comment 2
Latest try builds will be here: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=07d8344ac0ec.  These include the changes here and Gijs' changes to fix the customize button in 1094138.
Latest try looks pretty sweet, screenshot from my MBAir, OS X 10.10:
