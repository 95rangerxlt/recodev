On Nov. 12nd, I landed my patch to module/libpref/src/init/all.js to fix bug
224847. I've just found that three days later (Nov. 15th),
toolkit/locale/intl.properties had been created with __old__ values. We may have
to do something to prevent cases like this from happening again.

Sorry it's bug 224748. 
This should be a blocker to both 0.8 and 0.9. Even if not, we have to make sure
that it's fixed for FB 0.8 release.

do you have a branch tree?
I can check it in, if you don't mind.

Thanks!!!
Thanks for your prompt r. I've just landed the patch in the trunk and 0.8 branch. 

mscott, what's the branch name for TB 0.5 (beta)? I got branch names like 
THUNDERBIRD_M4_BRANCH: 1.1.0.10, THUNDERBIRD_M4_BASE: 1.1, but I'm not sure
which one is for impending 0.5 release. 
the 0.5 branch is THUNDERBIRD_M4_BRANCH

but bits are done for 0.5. The branch is closed

As long as it's fixed on the trunk, we should be ok going forward. Thanks.
Missed the boat for 0.8, final bits are spun and are being held for launch. 
Removed blocking0.8? and blocking0.9? flags since this has been marked fixed
