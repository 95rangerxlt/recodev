Are there any plans to allow importing old mork history files? If so, then mork will have to be around for that...
Is anything in Firefox still depending on /mork? Here it looks to be turned off by enabling places:

closing, per my previous comment. if there's anything else that needs to be done to remove mork, please re-open.

per the link in my previous comment, morkreader is enabled instead of the full mork component.
