replaceQueryString was added by bug 1053939, and it should have been deleted from aOpenParams after it was pulled out. openUILinkIn doesn't use this, and we shouldn't expand the API for something that is only destined for switchToTabHavingURI.

See http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/084441e904d1/browser/base/content/browser.js#l7353.

Looks good! Thanks for the patch :)
This doesn't need a try push since it is just removing the property and the property isn't being used elsewhere.
