open the "Help" menu item in the places' based bookmarks manager dialog gives me a js error

JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/utilityOverlay.js, line 409: strings
has no properties

it appears that we can't find the bundle_browser string bundle.

adds the bundle

Adds the bundle to the places window.
Isn't it already there? It wfm, like I'd expect, since places.xul is overlaid by chrome://browser/content/baseMenuOverlay.xul, and baseMenuOverlay.xul has the stringbundle. Am I missing something, or do we have some platform #ifdef I'm not seeing that makes it work on Mac and not on Windows?

adds the bundle

whoops, there's just no overlay point for baseMenuOverlay to insert.  I'll submit a better patch shortly.

like so

Now baseMenuOverlay can actually put the string bundles in that it cares about.

but please add a line break after the <script> element when checking it in.

I added the line break after the <script> element, per asaf.

Checking in places.xul;

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
