Currently, we migrate all items from the add-on bar to the nav-bar, regardless of whether or not the add-on bar was hidden.

Some users, however, have the add-on bar hidden, but populated by many items.

That's kind of annoying - a bunch of stuff suddenly shows up in the nav-bar that the user didn't originally know or care about.

We should probably just migrate the toolbar buttons to the palette if the add-on bar was hidden.

move widgets to palette in Australis if add-on bar was hidden pre-Australis,

This took longer than I thought, but here we are. This works in my testing (although until bug 854226 is uplifted the SDK will just keep adding stuff to the navbar... 'just because').

Just a request for a little documentation here to list the conditions under which movedOut could be false (namely, the addon-bar was collapsed, or the widget was just too damn wide to migrate).
