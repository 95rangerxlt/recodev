Andy's now bumped the maxVersion and my colleague seems to be using it without any problems. ->FIXED?
I really fancy this extension, for taking screenshots for bugs. :) The 2.0 bumped version is available at http://andy.5263.org/screengrab/
It hasn't be uploaded to a.m.o yet at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1146/.
