When there is a long address in the location bar, it's possible to display two tooltips at the same time - one for the address itself, and the 'drag and drop this icon...' tooltip.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with a long URL
2. Roll the mouse over the location bar
3. Move the mouse to the page icon
Actual Results:  
A tooltip for the page address is displayed, then a second tooltip is displayed on top of the first.

Expected Results:  
One tooltip at a time, please!

Confirming; I see indeed two tooltips. 
I expect the patch in bug 388030 to fix this.
I believe due to the relanding of Larry, I am not able to reproduce this. The first tooltip disappears when the caret changes to a normal mouse pointer before you get to the favicon.

I meant of course I-beam, not caret.

I still see the problem.
