In Bug 1220322 we created a migration URI that pointed to part of a sumo article.  This bug is to move the Learn More link for notifications off https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/push/ of and onto https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1220322 +++

As soon as we have https://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/%VERSION%/%OS%/%LOCALE%/push working with some the Push Notification text (bug 1220250) we will need to update the urls in our codebase to point here instead of https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/push/.

For the one time notification prompt on upgrade to let the user know about notification changes, we can link directly to a part of the page using something like:
https://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/%VERSION%/%OS%/%LOCALE%/push#w_[What's-New]

Code to change is here:

Thanks. Please make sure the content is ready before landing this. I agree this should have been on SUMO from the beginning since it's user-facing docs and we have a publishing pipeline on SUMO for this, no need to bug webdev.

Actually, can you remove these 2 prefs and use the standard method of:

Services.urlFormatter.formatURLPref("app.support.baseURL") + "push"
and
Services.urlFormatter.formatURLPref("app.support.baseURL") + "push#w_upgraded-notifications"

in the code?
The content is updated: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox

Just to confirm, you want to remove the about:config prefs completely?

Although we should land and uplift this, the content on both the sumo page and the www.mozilla.org page should be updated and almost identical by tomorrow morning.  Unassigning myself from this bug and I'll let someone from the push team pick this up, as I have to get back to my day job.

Yes from this file and prefs_general.js, this may require updating the tests and adding this app.support.baseURL pref to prefs_general.js plus a try push.

Thanks for handling the transition of content.

Given that push notifications is planned for FF44, it makes sense to link to the correct SUMO article. Let's uplift to Aurora44.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/dd19fd9498a2
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-b2g44_v2_5/rev/dd19fd9498a2
on windows nightly I got a migration notification and when i clicked on it i got this URL:

https://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/45.0a1/WINNT/en-US/push#w_upgraded-notifications

which returned a 404.

-e
After a bug has been uplifted or even landed on mozilla-central it's preferred to file a new bug so it can properly be tracked with the proper version. Please file a new bug blocking this if you still see the problem but that link works fine for me now.
oh - yeah URL works now - must have been the network outage.
