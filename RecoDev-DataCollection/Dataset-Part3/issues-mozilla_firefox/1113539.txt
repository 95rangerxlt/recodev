switching to dark theme does nothing
That's a pretty awesome bug, cc'ing Brian.

Question: are you sharing a profile between 34 and 36? We've seen other similar issues ( although not anywhere as severe ) related to running different channels on the same profile, see bug 1098343.
Yes I did, I created a new profile and copied my passwords and such over and now everything is fine again. I also overwrote my beta with a release install, that might have killed a few things.
I've never seen anything like this.  It's as if chrome://browser/skin/devtools/dark-theme.css isn't found or loaded.  But the JS is obviously loading as all the panels are being built and switching into the options panel works (although there is this error about the timeout in the console).

Definitely looks like a different thing from Bug 1098343.
There was a problem with the ADB Helper:

Thanks!  Ryan, didn't we just release an update to this?
Chris, can you please confirm which version of ADB Helper addon you have?
In the broken profile it is 0.7.2
Ugh.  Yes, we did release an update where ADB Helper 0.7.2 now patches the devtools.require method, but only for Firefox 34, to work around an inspector issue (bug 1091706).

It was tested by myself and the issue reporter, and we saw no issues.

Hopefully we can figure out how to reproduce this issue quickly, or else I suppose I should revert the ADB Helper change.
Chris, can you test a possible fix by install an updated XPI[1]?

[1]: http://people.mozilla.org/~rstinnett/
Be sure to restart Firefox after installing the update.
Installed, restarted. Same issue.
Okay, I think I will admit defeat for now...  I revert my hacked attempt to patch devtools from the add-on.  This will leave the inspector messed up for 34, but that's much better than the state we're seeing here.
Okay, I've removed the hack and updated the test XPIs.  Can you re-download and test again?
@Ryan: could you please also see bug 1113103 ? It seems that you did not see this and it seems you're the right person.
I've gone ahead and released 0.7.3, which removes the problematic code.

This should fix the issue, but it would be great to get confirmation.
