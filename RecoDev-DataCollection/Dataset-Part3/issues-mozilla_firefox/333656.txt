using the downloaded .exe I installed todays latest trunk build out of ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk
but didn't get talkback by default...

had to go back and run a custom install to turn talkback installation on.
 
to make sure we are getting the best coverage we can with the limited number of people that are testing on the trunk these days...

paul,  jay or I can help review the change to flip talkback from 20ish% installs to 100% if that is what the problem is...

The patch and review are the easy part; the hard part is remembering to flip it back on the 1.9 branch in early 2007 before the first alpha for Ecola. Is a blocking1.9a1 flag on another bug to do that going to work?

Turn it up to 11

Eh, we can figure something out for turning it back down. If nothing else, I can just assign a bug to myself, since my bug load's always low enough that I can look at them all every day ;)
creating a a bug to track turning the rate back down would work...  here are s om e other ideas to kick around...

do we have any doc that lists the steps taken to create a branch for shipping?  

I think chase might have started some of this kind of doc work.  if we do that is the place to list this change as well since we always do shipping products that have the talkback rate turned down off branches...

another way to keep from forgeting this would be to put some "offical branding" ifdefs around the rate specifications...

Could this be done by update channel perhaps? I.e. if a 'nightly' is being built set it to 100%, if a 'beta' is being built set it to 50%, and if a 'default' is being built set it to 20%?

Just a suggestion, the numbers are just examples. The default could be 10% maybe if there are too many reports being received.
