I installed FireFox b4pre3 and I was able to use tab candy.  Later, when I installed FireFox automatic updates, tab candy is no longer available.  OPT-SPACE does not invoke it and there does not appear to be any other way to do so.  When I reinstalled: firefox-4.0b3pre.en-US.mac64.dmg that I originally down loaded, tab candy is available.  So something in the automatic update "disables" it.

Reproducible: Always

The auto-update installs the normal nightly build which doesn't have tab candy.
tab candy is only a try-server build AFAIK
You'll need to redownload:

We might be able to provide builds from our maple project branch that may update to a newer build with bug 534954. But the maple branch doesn't produce nightlies anyway.. ?
Okay, I think what happened is that I downloaded the Tab Candy build and then I later accepted an automatic update that stomped the Tab Candy buid .  I have downloaded from tryserver again and all is well.  

On a side note, I think if you get Tab Candy dialed in right, it's going to be a significant step forward in terms of quality UI design.  It's an excellent concept!

Question - How do we get the 'latest and greatest' version as you continue to develop Tab Candy?  Is there a place I can register to get notified when an updated Tab Candy build is available?

I've posted a discussion about the 'try updating to minefield' issue at http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/e2e4590914bd9a3c#

My guess is that we will stop doing that, but I don't have any good options for updating Tab Candy builds. We're just not tooled up for that.
Not a problem.  I turned off automatic checking for updates in prefs.  Actually, I now think it's really better that way.

Just wanted to note that I have duplicated this bug as well. I have reinstalled the prerelease available here:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tryserver-builds/edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-2e4c476a50d0/
and have turned off automatic updates so as to curb this problem in the future.
When will be tab candy available in the official beta? Are there any plans for now?

I'm still having this isssue; used to have Tabcandy, upgraded to the latest Minefield, and Tabcandy disappeared - now all my tabs are in one gigantic window :(  There is no menu option at View -> Tab View, no icon on the right end of the tab bar, and Ctrl-E does nothing :(
Forgot to add, my build is:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b4pre) Gecko/20100810 Minefield/4.0b4pre

I got Minefield off the "Download now" link on Aza's TC page at http://www.azarask.in/projects/tabcandy/ and it's dated 10-Aug-2010 05:31 (tryserver-win32)
We are looking at Tab Candy being in Firefox Beta 4. No promises, however. That should also solve your problem, Anthony.
Mass moving all Tab Candy bugs from Mozilla Labs to Firefox::Tab Candy.  Filter the bugmail spam with "tabcandymassmove".
Aza, I upgraded to FF beta 4 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b3) Gecko/20100805 Firefox/4.0b3) and still don't see TabCandy.

Do I need to go back to using one of the Minefield builds?  If so, which one?

There used to be a win32 build off the Download Now link at http://www.azarask.in/projects/tabcandy/ but now it appears to be gone - there's just win32-debug.  I don't know what Maemo4 is - is that what I should use to see TabCandy again? (thanks)
TabCandy is integrated with Firefox trunk, so when you get an update to a nightly build, it'll have tabcandy.
You'll probably want this win32 installer:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/firefox-4.0b4pre.en-US.win32.installer.exe
