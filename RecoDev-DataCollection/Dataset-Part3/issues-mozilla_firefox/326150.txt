We took some changes in 1.0.1 that resulted in our search codes not being attached to Yahoo! searches from 1.0.1 through 1.0.7.  We'd like to resolve that.

In order to preserve the space-containing name for display, we need to bake the search code right into the plugin.  We should just take the ja-JP yahoo-jp.src and make it the yahoo.src for 1.0.x ja-JP localizations, IMO.

Also for ja-JPM and ko-KR.

Copy the plugins from the 1.8.0 branch

I copied the plugins from the 1.8.0 branch to 1.0.x, which from what I can tell is all there is to this bug.

We can add the fixed-aviary1.0.8 keyword now, right?

Yes.
There were two other plug-ins for Yahoo!Japan in 1.5, one for shopping and another for auctions.  I don't see that in the patch unless I'm missing something.
