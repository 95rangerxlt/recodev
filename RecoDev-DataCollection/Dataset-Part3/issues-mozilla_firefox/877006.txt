When buildWidget detects a widget with a view, and the elemnt for the view can't be found it throws an exception - sadly, this breaks all of CustomizableUI. It, er, shouldn't do that.

Nit: Since you're here, include the widget id in this log message?
Folded and pushed: https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/757b3bbe3c63
This was backed out yesterday: https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/a8a320338f33
Relanded with a fix in the tests as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/56af4ca8e542

using defaultArea for the widget breaks because it sticks around in the default placements after a reset. I'll file a bug on that in the next few hours.
