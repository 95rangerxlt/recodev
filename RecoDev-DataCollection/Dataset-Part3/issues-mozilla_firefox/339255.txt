Change 2.0a2 --> 2.0a3 in various and sundry files for the Alpha 3 release.
Created attachment 223362
bumps, based on patch from bug 337118
Also, as per bug 337188 comment 4, we should update the values of $update_appv and $update_extv in the tinder-config.pl from "2.0a2" to "2.0a3".

Should I file a separate bug for that?
