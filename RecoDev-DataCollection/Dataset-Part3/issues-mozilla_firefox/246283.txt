There seems to be a bug in the prebinding auto-update on 10.3.x. 
DYLD_PREBIND_DEBUG shows this output (long paths snipped):

dyld: ...../firefox-bin: prebinding disabled because time stamp of library:
..../libmozjs.dylib did not match

which is normal and should trigger fix_prebinding to update the prebinding. 
However, that fails with the following errors in system.log:

/usr/libexec/fix_prebinding: ..../libnspr4.dylib must be slid, but
fix_prebinding could not find a good place to relocate it.

I believe the message is inaccurate; there's no reason libnspr4 needs to be
moved, and in fact, it loads at its preferred address after this message appears.

So, pending a fix from Apple or a more detailed understanding of the problem,
I'd like to use a redo-prebinding.sh script as we did for Camino in OS X 10.1. 
This will use the update_prebinding tool to update prebinding in the background,
if the app did not launch prebound.

This is checked in on AVIARY_1_0_20040515_BRANCH.  Leaving bug open for trunk
landing, which will most easily be done as part of merging the nsAppRunner
changes to the trunk.
Version 0.9 did prebind for me, except for the one error in the console log. See below.

libxpcom.dylib does exist in the package though.

 file /Applications/Internet/Mozilla/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/libxpcom.dylib gives:

/Applications/Internet/Mozilla/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/libxpcom.dylib: Mach-O dynamically

Update prebinding still fails in the branch nightlies as July 28th's build. 
This should be considered for possible blocker for 1.0 mac release.
The prebinding error described in comment #4 also occurs for Thunderbird:

When upgrading to Thunderbird 0.7.3 on OS X 10.3 I encountered this bug.  I am
unable to run Thunderbird at all since then -- only the application menu
("Mozilla Thunderbird") appears, with the wait cursor (beachball) spinning
forever.  Downgrading to 0.7.1 doesn't help: same bug, same behavior.
Scratch #7 -- didn't have anything to do with prebinding, just a wierd coincidence.

prebinding did work after installing my 0.10 ff here yesterday.
As of 1.0 pre release, it seems like prebinding is invoked also when not running
as a user that can actaully update the binaries (which I presume is what is
happening, prebinding run by installing user appears to work as presumed).

OS X 10.3.5

disable prebinding on panther

It seems that prebinding still doesn't update quite right on panther, and more
to the point, as of 10.3.4 it's no longer needed due to improvements in the OS
dynamic linker.  So, I vote we turn it off for Panther to avoid the disk churn
on startup people complain about.

disable prebinding on panther

Checked in branch and trunk. Resolving as FIXED, however, note that it's fixed
by disabling it.
