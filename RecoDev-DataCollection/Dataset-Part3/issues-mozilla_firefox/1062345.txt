Break down the engineering work for implementing the reset from web feature described in http://people.mozilla.org/~mverdi/mockups/reset/refresh-from-web.pdf

The basic experience would work like this:
1. A user determines that something is wrong with Firefox.
2. They go to mozilla.org/firefox/new to download and install a new version of Firefox.
3. If they already have the latest version of Firefox, we display a reset button in addition to the normal "download a fresh copy" link.
4. The user clicks the reset button on /new and our existing reset feature is invoked.

Let's get this functionality from both www.mozilla.org and support.mozilla.org as it would be helpful to be able to do this from either the download page or support website.
Michael, have we decided on one of the flows yet?
If not, does that need to happen before this can be broken down?

Ultimately we'd like to do everything (changes in v1 + 2 + 3) but the changes in 1 and 2 might be a good first pass.
Just spoke to Phillip, and we agreed that for phase 1, we want:
- user flow 1
- user flow 2 excluding the improvements to about:welcomeback
Speaking to Michael, we also agreed that the FHR stuff from bug bug 860238 is an important part of this.

As part of this breakdown I also did breakdown bug 860238, the FHR part.

Bug 988725 is kind of a soft dependency.  It's potentially necessary to distinguish between ESR users and non-ESR users so that ESR users aren't told to update to non-ESR builds.  But as noted in that bug, it's also possible to just ask ESR users to update anyway, especially on the assumption that most of them won't be visiting the download page.
Thanks Drew!

I see you added bug 988725 - when I reviewed that last week, I was thinking it might be simpler to add a way to query the version number via UITour instead (e.g. a "requestVersion" command that responds with the version, similar to the "is sync enabled?" thing). Any thoughts on that?
Do we want to consider changing the text and button copy related to this in about:support? http://cl.ly/image/3r3p062S261Y
We'll cover that in bug 1063702.
I removed the dependency on bug 988725 in favor of a dependency on bug 1065525 and broadened bug 1063702's scope to update all reset-related strings and UI in the app.
