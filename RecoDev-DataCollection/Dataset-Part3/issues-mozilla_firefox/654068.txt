In the Style Inspector it is currently possible to click:
1. A CSS Property: this displays the MDC page about that property
2. A properties value or anywhere else on the row: If there are unmatched rules then they will be expanded on the rows below, but otherwise nothing happens.

You currently have to click on each computed style in turn in order to discover which CSS values have unmatched rules. We need to add a visual indicator to simplify this.

I was finally able to get a handle on this. The problem is that no visual indicator is displayed when there are unmatched rules but not matched rules.

Improved patch
Created attachment 531552
Add unmatched indicator 3

Noticed a property that could potentially make the display of this link optional so the patch now uses it.
This fix was added to the patch for bug 582596
