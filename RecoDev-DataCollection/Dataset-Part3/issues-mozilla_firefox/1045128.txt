Currently we build releases against the MacOS X 10.6 SDK. This SDK is no longer distributed as part of Xcode, and makes it difficult to reproduce the release build environment.

If it causes no problems running on 10.6 we should bump the target to MacOSX10.7.sdk or MacOSX10.8.sdk.

Bump release SDK to MacOS X 10.7

Patch to bump to 10.7, the minimum needed for bug 941296. What kind of testing do we need to validate this?
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=9254ec323b17
If it passes our 10.6 testers on Try I don't see any reason that we'd have a problem with it.
You should also add a check in configure that developers are using the 10.7SDK or later.
Should I check for >= 10.7 here, or just check for CoreMedia/CoreMedia.h in bug 941296? That will give a more relevant error message if someone passes --with-macos-sdk=MacOSX10.6.sdk.
I don't have a strong opinion on how you do it as long as we error out with a clear message.

Require 10.7 sdk in configure

Patch written for testing purposes. I don't think we should do this.

Bump release SDK to MacOS X 10.7

So far, so good.

I just found that my builds fail to run on OS X 10.6 if I specify the following:

ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk
ac_add_options --enable-macos-target=10.7

But they seem to work fine (at least so far) if I do this:

ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk
ac_add_options --enable-macos-target=10.6
