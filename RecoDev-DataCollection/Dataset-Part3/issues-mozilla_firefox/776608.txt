Comparison of MacOSX Preview and Fx15b native PDF viewer rendering

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0
Build ID: 20120717110313

Steps to reproduce:

Followed link (http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/pres0410/2-4_SSUSB_DevCon_UASP_Stevens.pdf) to a PDF doc.


Actual results:

Doc is shown otherwise OK, but it has extra horizontal lines on every page. The lines are shown only in the Fx15beta's native PDF viewer, not for example in the Preview application of the Mac OSX. See the screenshot that is atttached showing the comparison of Preview and Fx native PDF viewer.


Expected results:

No extra lines should not be seen.

File that has the problem

This file shows the issue - it occurs on Windows
Is this a blocker for Firefox 19 or will the new feature be released with this known bug?  If so many people will find that the new feature does not work too well

File with same problem

Okular and Adobe Reader show the document without the bogus lines.
All Pdf files on this webpage (http://www.institute-christ-king.org/latin-mass-resources/sacred-music/) display and print with extra horizontal black lines.  The lines appear over the parts of the pdf files that in the source files were 600 dpi bitmaps.

Here is a link to an example: http://www.institute-christ-king.org/uploads/music/Common/MassVigApos_lg.pdf

Lines do not appear when using IE or Chrome, or when using Firefox with the Adobe addin.  Tested on WinXP, Vista and Win7.
Lines are still present in latest nightlies. Another instance: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/COURSES/UNM/ece637-Fall2003/papers/AV88.pdf
