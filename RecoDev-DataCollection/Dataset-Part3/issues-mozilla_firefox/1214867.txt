We serialize, deserialize, and store the heap snapshot's creation timestamp, but don't expose it to JS. Just a small oversight.

I'd call this creationTime.
As per https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=22824 and https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/TiE00xh6Ihg/CnCIJFS8BAAJ, I'm going to return the microseconds (not milliseconds) since the epoch directly rather than a Date object.

Let me know if you feel strongly otherwise, Bobby, or if you feel strongly that we should return milliseconds rather than microseconds.
