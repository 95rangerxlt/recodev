Recently added the ability to open an external URL in the Style Inspector in a new window: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677930.

We should use openUILinkIn to allow us to open multiple links in multiple tabs, as opposed to opening the resource in a new window.

Initial patch that opens external URLs in new tab instead of new window
Michael,
I have submitted a patch for review.  A couple of notes:
1) I used the fat arrow function to bind `this` on the event handler.  I've seen that in use elsewhere in the devtools code, so figured this would be OK.
2) It may not be needed to actually use an <a> tag now that we are opening in a new tab, but I left it in since it would likely be just setting an attribute on a span rather than href on the a tag.
3) Regarding testing, I am currently just checking the `href` attribute to make sure it is correct - do you think it would be good to somehow also check to make sure a tab opens?

Thanks, and let me know if there is anything I can do to improve the patch.

Yes, we like fat arrow functions ;o)

In this case an a tag makes sense.

You could do that but programatically clicking things can cause problems due by focus issues. I think the current test is fine.

Nope, it is great as it is.
has this run through try or through a local test run? If either answer is true, this can land?
I don't have access to the try server, but I have run the local tests with mach mochitest-browser and everything is green.  I'm sure Michael could give a more definitive answer.
I will run it through try.

got some broken builds on Win7 and Fedora.

Looking at the logs they look like infrastructure blow-outs. Retriggered the builds to see what happens.
