Responsive Design View is separate from the page inspector because you can switch it on and browse around just seeing how things look without inspecting elements.

The Developer Toolbar (currently behind devtools.toolbar.enabled pref, which will be on sometime soon) will have a popup menu that includes the Responsive Design View, so you can toggle the tool from that menu. There should also be a command to control it, but that doesn't exist yet.

Given that Responsive Design View has a couple of buttons already, it seems reasonable to have a close button.
There is no buttons yet because it's not easy to keep the button on the top right corner (window & linux).

The top right corner of the responsive-mode container can be hidden because off-screen (if the browser is bigger than firefox' window).

So the button's position needs to be dynamically adjusted in JavaScript.

The button should be on the top right corner. And this is the difficulty of this bug. I don't see how we can easily add a button there.

Maybe we could add a floating button that is moved dynamically as we change the size of the browser.

Close button "aligned" right

I've improved the patch a little, but I think it's not what Paul meant. As I'm starting now, maybe I should get an easier bug to take care ...
Thanks.
Why not add the the close button as a textual button (just like rotate) and just next to the rotate button. That way, it will be matching to the rest of the UI of responsive mode and also, the issue of dynamically adjusting the position of the close button would not arise ?
Comment on attachment 687397

The problem with this approach is that the close button keeps moving as you resize the browser :/
The responsive mode will have a toggle button in the toolbox. That will make the situation better.

better for sure, but not everyone will have the toolbox opened. There are shortcuts and menu entries to start responsive mode too.
I suggest that we just do what William did in his first attachment, but instead of using a close icon, we use the Responsive Mode icon we use in the toolbox: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/gnomestripe/devtools/toolbox.css#74

William, I assigned you, let me know if you can't work on this. Thanks.
I'd second Girish Sharma, the close button next to "rotate" would be always visible and not in a surprising location, but where all this view's UI elements are.
Like I said, we should just have a button there (where all the buttons are), but not a close button, but a checked responsive view button (like in the toolbox).

I don't know the right place to put this CSS. I've tried to create an external CSS file called responsivedesign.css in MOZILLA_SRC_DIR/browser/devtools/responsivedesign/ but I didn't figure out how to link it with Responsive Design Mode. Please, send me your feedback. How would you handle this situation?

Adds the icon to the button.

This should be in "browser/themes/*stripe/browser.css":

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser.css#3698


Also, the close button should have a checked=true attribute.

Thank you for taking of that :)

Close button using id="close-button"

I've changed common.css to use #close-button but it's overridden by another style with the same id.

"#close-button {
  list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/devtools/command-responsivemode.png");
  -moz-image-region: rect(0px, 16px, 16px, 0px);
}"

I can change this id to another one or use an "!important":

"#close-button {
  list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/devtools/command-responsivemode.png") !important;
  -moz-image-region: rect(0px, 16px, 16px, 0px);
}"

Which approach would you use?

Oh, of course, my bad, I forgot we were in the browser context.
So in your latest patch, change the class into an id.

You need to use a class.

Looks good.

Because this button doesn't have text, it needs a tooltip.

You need to use the "tooltip-text" attribute, and use a localized string. See how it's done there:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/responsivedesign/responsivedesign.jsm#333
and
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/responsiveUI.properties

Maybe the tooltip can say:

"Leave responsive design mode"

Since this is tooltip, the R, D and M should not be all capital. Something like "Leave responsive design mode"

I am not sure whether the word "mode" should be used or not. In the menu items, we use "view" as in Responsive Design View.

I know, but its just my thought. Having an always on button, on which user is supposed to click to toggle it off to turn the responsive mode off is weird. Furthermore, the off state of the icon will never be visible.

But if you are okay with it, then its fine.

Ok - that's fair.

Close button
Thanks for the screenshot. It helps.

I agree with Girish on the "the always enabled icon". It's strange.

Putting the close button in the upper right corner shouldn't be hard. Of course it's comlicated because of the reasons Paul mentioned and I agree. I think we have theses troubles because our toolbar is part of the window. When the resolution is too big, scrollbars appear and they scroll not only the responsive view but the preset list and the rotate button too.

I say we create some kind of real toolbar like the one on the other tools. Just before tool unification they all got a close button on the right. Right now only the developer toolbar still has one. We solve two problems at the same time.

On this gimped screenshot (excuse the quality), you can see what I mean. I added the scrollbars on purpose to show what part of the screen could be scrollable.

What do you think?

No. No need to come up with such a big toolbar just to fix this close button issue.

What if we put a close button in the top left corner?

I think that is a nice tradeoff we can have. Any other choice is an overkill for such a small feature.
I agree that it seems like an  overkill but because the icons are not on a toolbar if someone scrolls a big preview area, the buttons disappear. 

I still think it's a good  to create a real fixed toolbar right now. It will be useful for direct width/height input.

In some circumstances, the whole toolbar disappears after scroll. I filed Bug 873092 to cover that issue.
