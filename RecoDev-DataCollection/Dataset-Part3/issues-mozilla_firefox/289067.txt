Is this an issue now that bug 263698 is fixed? It seems to work fine for me in
recent Firefox builds in Windows (I get suggested a ".jpg" filename when
downloading the image). I'm guessing that this really isn't a Linux only issue,
as the OS field implies, since comments in bug 264757 seem to indicate otherwise.
Yeah, looks like the checkin for bug 294759 ported this fix too.
