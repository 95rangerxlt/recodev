The docs for protocol.js say that a Front takes a client and the form `{ actorID: <id> }` but it should just be actor. Also a few places need 4 spaces not 2.

Nick you were the last one to touch this :p Not sure this really even needs to be reviewed though, it's a tiny change

If you look at the patch, it's literally just a few changes to a markdown file... No executable code at all. Should I really use try?
No need in this case. However, given that it's our default policy and parsing through every patch of every checkin-needed bug doesn't really scale (how many do you think we do daily?), a brief comment at the time of the request like you gave in comment 5 would have worked.

Sounds good, will do next time, thanks!
