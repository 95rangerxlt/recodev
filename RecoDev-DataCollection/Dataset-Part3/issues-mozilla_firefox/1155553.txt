STR:
- Use the latest fx-team build
- Open the attached test case
- Open the inspector
- Switch to the animation sidebar tab
- Select an animated node

Expected: the pause/play all button is displayed at the top, and the animation player widget has rewind/fforward buttons, playback rate select, and the timeline can be moved.

Actual: none of these ui controls appear.

One of the first things the animation controller does is test the server's capabilities and displays ui controls according to what the server supports.

It looks like a recent change caused a race condition in the animation-controller's init function that makes all of these flags turn false, and so the ui appears as if the server didn't support any of these things.

None of the tests caught this because the race condition somehow doesn't occur when running tests.
This was caused by http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6a11cd24dd6f (Bug 1153903).
