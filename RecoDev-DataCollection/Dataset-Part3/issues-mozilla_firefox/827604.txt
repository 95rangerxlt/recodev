STR:
1) Lock a node in the highlighter
2) Pseudo-class lock :hover
3) Move to an unrelated node

The lock should clear, but doesn't.

4) Close the panel

The lock is still there.

Clear locks when higlighting non-hierarchy node

This patch adds back the pre-toolbox functionality. When inspecting a new node, the pseudo-class locks for the previous node are cleared if the new node is in a different hierarchy chain (i.e. the breadcrumbs would have to be updated).

This patch also tests navigating to both hierarchy (parent) and non-hierarchy (sibling) nodes.
