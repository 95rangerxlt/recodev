Use the same character encoding for README.txt as the installer, as different
platforms are better suited with different character encodings.

The version in CVS will always be in UTF-8.

Basically, I plan to include charset.mk in the browser/locales/Makefile and then
use iconv to convert from UTF-8 to the specific codepage used on Windows for
that language, to get a README.txt well encoded for each platform.

Use different encoding for README.txt based on platform used

This should fix it.

Please rename README_FILES to README_FILE

>+include $(topsrcdir)/toolkit/locales/$(AB_CD)/installer/windows/charset.mk

We should only include this file if we're on the win32 case, and we should only
call iconv on non-en-US win32, so something like this:

> libs:: $(addprefix $(AB_CD)/,$(README_FILES))
>-	$(INSTALL) $^ $(DIST)/bin
>+	iconv -f UTF-8 -t $(README_CHARSET) $^ > $(DIST)/bin/$(README_FILES)

if

> libs realchrome:: $(addprefix $(AB_CD)/profile/,$(PROFILE_FILES))
> 	$(INSTALL) $^ $(DIST)/bin/defaults/profile
> 
> libs realchrome:: $(addprefix $(AB_CD)/profile/chrome/,$(PROFILE_CHROME))
> 	$(INSTALL) $^ $(DIST)/bin/defaults/profile/chrome

README_FILES will likely contain the license file in the near future.

a=asa for aviary checkin.
Fixed on branch, doesn't apply to trunk yet
I still see README.txt in UTF-8 on Windows.
