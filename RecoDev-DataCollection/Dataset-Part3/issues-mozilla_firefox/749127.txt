Derp.
We get the additional "this" variable in the local scope. This test doesn't and shouldn't handle that.
Note: the failure in propertyview-05 is unrelated to the one in propertyview-06 (fixed by the attached patch), but the reason is identical to the other timeout debugger test failures ("gDebuggee.simpleCall is not a function" and "this._model is null in source-editor-orion.jsm").
Thanks for fixing this so quickly :-)

And yeah missed the 05/06, read them both as the same. I'll morph this to be about 06.

This seems like a case where the editor API is used before it is initialized.

Yup, just as we discussed on IRC. The originating problem for the propertyview-05 failure is the same as everywhere else.
