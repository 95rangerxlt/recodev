There should be an option to filter properties by category. We have far too many properties now displayed at once, and it would be helpful, at times to just filter them out based on categories.

We could have a drop down or a contextmenu with the list of categories.

With the filter field and "only user styles" checkbox I would say that using categories is now pointless.

Anybody disagree?
Nobody disagrees, closing.
