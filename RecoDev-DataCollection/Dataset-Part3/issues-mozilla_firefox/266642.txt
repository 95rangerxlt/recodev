After smoketesting the win32 installer for Firefox 1.0RC1, a few accesskeys were
found to be not localized. Here I attached the following files to replace the
older ones in the CVS in order to correct those problems:

browser\locales\ast-ES\chrome\browser\bookmarks\bookmarks.properties
browser\locales\ast-ES\chrome\browser\pageInfo.dtd
browser\locales\ast-ES\chrome\browser\history\history.dtd
browser\locales\ast-ES\chrome\profile\bookmarks.html
toolkit\locales\ast-ES\chrome\global\customizeToolbar.dtd
toolkit\locales\ast-ES\chrome\global\editMenuOverlay.dtd
toolkit\locales\ast-ES\chrome\global\viewSource.dtd 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Not localized accesskeys
2. Should be localized
3. English access key appears between brackets

patches for ast-ES localization

I didn't see the proposed patches/files (sorry for that) landing on the ast-ES
cvs. I have attached two patches (correct format now), one for the browser
component, and the other for the toolkit. I hope they can be commited to cvs.
It solves bug 266043 (amazondotcom.src).

However, I fixed one file (bug 267500) but I cannot get a patch for it:

[xa@raguel]cvs diff chrome/mozapps/plugins/plugins.dtd >patch4
cvs diff: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory
cvs [diff aborted]: no repository

I don't know how to commit the fixed file to cvs.
OK, I was told how to commit the files and I think they definitly are. They were
the same they were approved, plus the chrome/mozapps/plugins/plugins.dtd that
covered bug 267500. I still don't see the changes in the lxr.mozilla.org, when
they appear I think the bug can be closed.
