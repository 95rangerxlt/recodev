STR:
1.) Open the toolbar customization dialog.
2.) Close the dialog

Actual results:
All bookmarks are collapsed into the chevron.

Expected results:
Bookmarks fill the toolbar until there is no more space.

Because we're calling _init() in the constructor, our boxObject hasn't had a chance to get the proper size yet, so we're measuring it as 0.

Putting this call in a setTimeout gives boxObject time to get its head straight.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
