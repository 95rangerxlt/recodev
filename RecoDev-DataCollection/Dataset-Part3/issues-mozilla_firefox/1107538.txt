I'm hearing we may want to have the "Mute" buttons that are part of attachment 8485640 from bug 1058775 sooner than the rest of this new design.

Philipp told me to file a bug so that he can make a quick mock-up of how the mute buttons should be presented in the existing sharing doorhanger.

Note: the related implementation bugs are bug 1065966 and bug 1065963 which depends on platform work from bug 1066082.

Perhaps we can use the mute mockup from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052011#c4 ?
(After chatting with Florian, probably not, but at least he now has a link to the mockup I showed him.  ;)

Mockup

Sorry this took so long. Here's the mockup.

Florian, does this address everything we'll do in the short term?

Thanks. I know we asked for minimal changes, but I'm wondering if we shouldn't add microphone, camera and screen sharing icons on these lines so that it's obvious what type of device each line is for. I think the "Facetime HD camera" and "Built-in Microphone" strings are coming from the device driver or operating system, so I don't think we have any guarantee of them being sufficiently descriptive.

> Florian, does this address everything we'll do in the short term?

Apart from the point above, I think it does.

Adding needinfo on Randell who may also have an opinion on the mockup, and Maire to check how soon we should work on implementing this (the related platform work doesn't seem to have started).

Mockup with icons

New mockup with icons.
Looks nice!
I don't want to bikeshed too much on words...but "Mute" for a camera (or a Word document window...which I assume is referring to screen sharing) makes little to no-sense, even as a native-English speaker. "Share" and "Stop" might make more sense in those cases.
We already use »Stop« for actually killing the stream (which is non-reversible).
I'm not a native English speaker, but perhaps we could use something like »Turn off« and »Turn on«?
I agree "Stop" isn't usable. I was wondering if "Pause" would make sense.
Pause is a good word in english.  This also may align with some other things we're discussing involving the spec and getUserMedia and camera access.
Should we go with Mute/Unmute for audio streams and Pause/Resume for video streams then?
I think Pause and Resume would also work for audio streams, and would let us keep the wording consistent.

Muting Mockup

Yes, pause/resume sounds good!
Here's a mockup with the latest changes.

I could put someone from platform on this this week.  How would that work timing-wise for the UI implementation work?

Assuming the platform work gets done for 38, I'll arrange to get the UI work done in the 39 cycle (if not sooner).
Ok, I see Bug 1065966 is for the UI implementation.  Randell -- Can you file a bug for the platform implementation and assign it to yourself?  I think you can probably do it in the time it would take to explain it to someone else. :-) 

As Florian indicates above, we'd like to get the platform work done in Fx38 (before mid-February).

The platform bug is bug 1066082.
Thanks, Florian.  Randell -- I just assigned bug 1066082 to you.  (So I'm cancelling the needinfo here.)
