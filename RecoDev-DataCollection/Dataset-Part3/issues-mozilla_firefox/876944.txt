CustomizeMode.jsm needs to handle the cases when an API widgets is created or destroyed, via the onWidgetCreated and onWidgetDestroyed events.

Note also bug 876926, which probably necessitates the need for a onWidgetDestroying event.

Not taking this for Australis:M7.
What's the impact of not handling this? Don't know how to assign a priority otherwise.
Neither case should be common. Not handling widgets being created should just be an annoyance (so, something we want to fix, but not a priority IMO).

However, not handling widgets being destroyed could break the browser window - so I think that at least should be fixed before release. That could happen in any of the following instances:
* add-on updated
* add-on disabled/uninstalled (via another window - unlikely, but possible)
* add-on blocklisted
* changing add-on references while customizing (both are "customizing my browser", so I can imagine people doing this)

So, I think we can be pretty minimal with the fix here and still address the main issue. And just leave everything else to a followup when we have time.

customizemode should deal with creating/destroying widgets,

This should do. I needed a notification after the node had been added to the windows, should it have a placement already, so I added one. Feel free to nitpick naming. :-)
