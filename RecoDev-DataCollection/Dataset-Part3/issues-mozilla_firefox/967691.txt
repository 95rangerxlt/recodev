I saw on graph server a large regression in tpaint:
http://graphs.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=[[82,131,25]]&sel=none&displayrange=30&datatype=running

I followed it down to the fx-team branch:
http://graphs.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=[[82,132,25]]&sel=none&displayrange=30&datatype=running

This is also seen on datazilla:
https://datazilla.mozilla.org/?start=1390065227&stop=1390623295&product=Firefox&repository=Fx-Team-Non-PGO&os=win&os_version=6.1.7601&test=tpaint&graph_search=228214210aa5&x86_64=false&project=talos

the source for tpaint is in talos:
http://hg.mozilla.org/build/talos/file/79702830f03d/talos/startup_test/tpaint.html

Here is the documentation we have for tpaint:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests#tpaint

I tracked it down via retriggers on tbpl and this is the revision where the regression was introduced:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Fx-Team&rev=228214210aa5

Is this an expected regression?  It doesn't seem to affect mac and linux as much, quite possibly this has specific windows code?

This is known and should be fixed by bug 963105.
it appears that the work in bug 963105 has fixed this performance problem.
this is on aurora- will bug 963105 land there:

This doesn't make sense. Bug 963105 should already be on Aurora.
ok, I have verified the fix in bug 963105 is indeed in aurora.  The bump occurred when we uplifted m-c -> aurora, the difference must be in there somewhere.

the regression looks to be from a week or two earlier on or around Jan 14th:
http://graphs.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=[[82,1,37]]&sel=none&displayrange=90&datatype=running

fun times.
