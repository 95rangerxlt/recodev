This is trivial and easily doable for 1.1.  However, if by some incredibly odd
twist of fate we weren't able to fix this quickly enough it's not nearly
important enough to block 1.1.  Steffen, feel like picking this up?  It's
probably a five-minute fix (assuming you can find Mano on IRC for a once-over to
make sure we're correctly documenting a platform neither of us uses).

Yeah, I thought about doing that these days :)

So we have on Mac:
  Cmd+.
  Esc

On the other platforms:
  Esc

Mano, can you please confirm that it does indeed look like that on Mac?

The intent of my first comment was to say that Mano's once-over for correctness
would be sufficient for review purposes, but in my attempt to be concise I
apparently didn't communicate that.  :-)
