Patch

The loadSubScript function in dbg-server.jsm is imported into a sandbox and then executed to load subscripts.  Importing functions totally confuses our compartment sharing stuff we have for b2g, so those subscripts are ending up being run in the JSM scope instead of in the sandbox.  The attached patch creates the function in the sandbox so it's associated with the right scope and good things happen.

robcee, please redirect the review if you can't review this.

Can you use function.toSource() instead?
function.toSource() is our extension. Standard function.toString() would be preferred.
