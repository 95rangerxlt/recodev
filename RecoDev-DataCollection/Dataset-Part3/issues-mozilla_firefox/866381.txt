Patch

STR:

1. Use Heather Arthur's scratchpad[0] to open a toolbox for a chrome window.
2. Try to use the Inspector

ER:
The style pane and search box should work.

AR:
The style pane and search box do not work.

(this patch only fixes these, which is valuable in itself IMHO; the highlighter seems to still be broken, looking into that now)
