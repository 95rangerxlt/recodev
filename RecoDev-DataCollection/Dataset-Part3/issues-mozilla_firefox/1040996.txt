disable Flash on desktop runtime

We didn't want to support plugins in the desktop runtime, but we thought Flash would be too popular to disable, so we enabled it as an exception to the general rule in bug 755554.

Nevertheless, since then we've stood up two other runtimes窶認xOS and Android窶馬either of which supports Flash, which adds an inconsistency between the APIs available on the various runtimes.

And most Open Web Apps are designed to support the FxOS and Android runtimes, so they don't use Flash anyway.  Not to mention that the popularity of Flash for app development has declined even on the desktop.

Meanwhile, supporting Flash imposes a maintenance cost, which no longer seems worth it.  So we should disable Flash on the desktop runtime.
