Use an ellipsis here, there are some in this file that you can copy paste.

For example, here is an ellipsis to copy ;)

Can you factor this mess out into a shared function in head.js? It is really gross looking, and my delicate sense of aesthetics would prefer it wasn't duplicated across multiple tests.

Are you sure it's 78px for all locales ? It's very likely going to be longer for other locales.

I'm not too happy with the margin hack we're using. There are better ways to accomplish our current layout. Can you file a bug to fix that up ?

Ideally, I'd use devtools-button since it's for HTML, but unfortunately, devtools-button isn't well tailored for text buttons. Anyway, I'm fine with keeping .devtools-toolbarbutton for now, and optimize devtools-button for text buttons in another bug.

If it's not, it's likely going to break the layout for other locales.

Sure, perf uses "..." in this instance, though

Mostly to visually separate and can skip over things that aren't being explicitly tested (i.e. exporting)

min-width is 78px, so could be longer, so this would break for smaller locales, you're right, not sure a better way to do this

Made the changes other than the positioning of the toolbar not using the calc of the sidebar width, should be a follow up if necessary
