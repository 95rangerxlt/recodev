just add a comment here saying this is a list of promises for installations that are in progress.

We could also change the name of the variable to make it more clear, but it would probably get too big.  installsInProgress or something?  I guess if the comment is clear enough it's not necessary, but "installations" gives me the sense of "currently installed apps"
