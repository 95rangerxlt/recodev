Bug 69114 gave nsFileProtocolHandler a copy of the code for resolving Windows internet shortcut (.url) URLs that we copied from xpfe's nsBookmarksService.cpp for profile migration. We should switch to using that copy instead of maintaining (or not) our own, though possibly not until bug 361857 is fixed. That probably depends on whether our current copy works any better.

(This bug is actually a duplicate of bug 248538, but nobody figured that out before it went completely off the rails, so I'm starting over with all the bugs it became, so I can close it.)
