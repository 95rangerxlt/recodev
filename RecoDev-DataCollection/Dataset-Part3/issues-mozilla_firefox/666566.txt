backed out from mozilla-inbound because part of a push that increased number of random failures in Panorama browser-chrome tests.
Please reland in smaller chunks when ready.

Patch v1 bounced because we need to add the listener for browser-delayed-startup-finished even before the browser's onLoad event is dispatched because that's sometimes too late (so that the delayed startup was already run and we're waiting for that to occur).
