This is the simple first step - just indicate whether there's a user-set value or not.

I'd like to take this on Aurora/Beta to get some more data before we move on to implementation in bug 718088. Risk is very low, it's just a simple pref check and telemetry addition. No string changes.

[Triage Comment]
Telemetry additions are high-reward and low-risk, so approving for Aurora 12 and Beta 11.
