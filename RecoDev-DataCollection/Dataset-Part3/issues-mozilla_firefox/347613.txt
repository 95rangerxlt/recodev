I believe there are multiple separate issues to this bug:

1. The location bar is taller than the go button when using Windows Classic Style, causing the Go button not to line up with it.

2. The border around the Go and Search buttons is part of the graphic, rather than using native controls.  The border looks inconsistent when using Windows Classic Style.

3. The colors of both the Go and Search buttons have been designed to complement the Windows XP Style default colors, and are less suitable for other colours, such as the Windows Classic Style grays.

Highest priority would be 1, followed by 2, followed by 3.  Personally, I don't particularly mind 3.

Suggestions for fixes, respectively:

1. Reduce the height of the location bar when viewed in Windows Classic Style.  Or, design the Go button so that its height scales to the size of the bar.

2. Design the Go and Search buttons in such a way as the border around them matches the appearance of the borders around the location and search bars.  If possible, use the same appearance as the native controls.

3. Use alpha transparency on the Go and Search buttons to ensure that the background color is substantially derived from the color of the toolbar itself, rather than assuming the color of the toolbar will be consistent across different environments.

To people using Classic, how does this look with the new transparent button?

It solves problem 3 in comment #4.  It looks better in terms of colour.  Problems 1 and 2 remain.

Problem 1 is bug 348138.

Problem 2 may be solved by bug 347616, which itself probably depends on a solution like bug 348138.
Discussed with beltzner, 1 and 2 are not going to change at this point, resolving fixed.
