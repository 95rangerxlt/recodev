You need something like:

Thanks for the patch! I'm not a Firefox peer, so forwarding to Dao.

> +  var treecolIndex = treecol.index;
var index = treecol.index;
"treecolIndex" is redundant since this method deals with tree columns.
f=me with this fixed.

Back when I tried this in SeaMonkey it didn't work because tree.columns weren't iterable. I guess this has been fixed?
If it didn't work earlier, probably not.
To fix this bug, you can use the patch that was started by Raymond and then address the feedback in comment #6.

Show arrow after sorting column in pageInfo (by applying patch v2). Set metaNode name attribute to empty string when no name is provided.

When applying patch v2 by :raymondlee the arrow indication seemed to be working very well already. Only when sorting by the name column in the meta tag tree view the sorting itself did not work since some of the entries were null (e.g. as described in 782623) and the comparing function crashed. 
So I changed the metaNode entry rows to now contain an empty string when nothing else is set (I hope that is ok). 

I'm not entirely sure I fully understood the issues in #5 and #6 but I think it should be working now.

Please pass in "true" here instead of `true`, which is what the second half of comment #5 was asking for.

Ditto.

Instead of passing an empty string here, please change the comparator functions to handle null as an empty string.

For example,
function textComparator(a, b) { return a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()); },
would become:
function textComparator(a, b) { return (a || "").toLowerCase().localeCompare((b || "").toLowerCase()); },

Show arrow after sorting column in pageInfo. Provide empty string for comparison function if no according attribute was set. r=jaws

Thank you for your feedback, Jared. 

I updated my patch accordingly (moved empty string creation to comparison function, set attribute properly) and hope it is now working correctly. 

Best regards
Michael
