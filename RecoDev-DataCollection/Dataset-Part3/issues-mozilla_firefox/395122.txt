tentative patch

Since FDL landed on trunk, chrome-on-content stacks have regressed in ways which break the toolbar customization sheet whenever a page is loaded. We'll experience using a panel here instead.

I'll log a follow up for moving the panel when the browser window is moved.

I wonder if removing the <stack> could break any extensions. But then you are saying the using the stack for "chrome-over-content" is busted anyways.
