Description: The labels within Active Character Encodings not seen in inspect objects thus not announced by WE. It is important to notice that this happens once and after tabbing around this problem is not seen.

Steps to recreate:
1. Alt V to "toolbar", tab down to "Character Encoding"

2. Tab over to "Customize List" hit enter

3. The label Available Character Encodings is read by WE and is seen by Inspect objects, but you will notice that the label "Arabic (IBM 864) which the focus is  on is not seen by inspect object or read by WE. If you tab again will see the same problem w/ "Western (ISO-88591) not be announced by WE.

The reported problem is seen once after tabbing around you will notice that the problem is not seen again.

Force selection of list items on focus

I'm not a UI peer :/
The solution is okay by me, though.

Force selection of list items on focus

Is there any reason why we're only doing this here instead of in all lists? As Mano explained the difference in behaviour here, I'm OK with it; makes sense to me that tabbing into a list selects the tabitem and not the list itself.

r=mano
This works in the general case; this window is the exception that needs a workaround.  This window clears the selection of one list when the other list receives focus.  The workaround just reverses the "damage".
