better patch
The previous patch made us rebuild the popup for each popupshowing. This new one only rebuilds the popup on the first popupshowing, or when things have changed.

Hmm.  How about we remove the check from rebuildPopup, and check _needToRebuildPopup in rebuildPopupDynamic and then call rebuildPopup from there?  saves one function call on every popupshowing, and avoids having to set it from every caller
