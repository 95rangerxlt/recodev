Hi Edouard, sorry about this. Bryan is right. We should return the Terms of Service and Privacy Notice links to separate lines, but increase the spacing between them. 1em margin? 200% line-height? I'm not sure what is standard in in-content prefs, but the image linked in URL shows the right spacing.
