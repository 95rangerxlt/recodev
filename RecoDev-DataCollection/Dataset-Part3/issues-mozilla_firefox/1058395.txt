For mixed content blocking we say "Disable protection for now".
For tracking protection we say "Disable protection".

There is a difference - disabling content blocking is for the lifetime of that tab, while disabling tracking protection is until it's re-enabled again and affects all tabs.

Some people have found that the language used doesn't make that clear to them - the language difference is too subtle, which leads to either confusion or assuming they're the same. 

So maybe we can find some clearer language to use here.

This was intended to be "Disable protection for this site". Is that clear enough?
Just chatted with phlsa on irc. His feedback was that 

"Disable protection for now" with mixed content is clear enough to indicate temporary disabling (see also https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1041748#c6)

"Disable protection for this site" for tracking protection is enough to indicated that the site is unblocked until the user re-enables it.
From https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1058348#c6 it looks like it is OK to close this bug since phlsa is indeed UX.
