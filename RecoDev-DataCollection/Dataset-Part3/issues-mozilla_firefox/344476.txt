ugly pic.

the installer's screenshot
As I wrote in bug 344985#c7, I think this bug should be used to fix the behavior of the installer, that is, how installer treat the font setting.
# not only changing font size setting for zh-CN nor ja

At first, I write more details about current situation.
# See also attachment 229556, 229558, 229560, 229563 in bug 344985.

As you can see, after setting the font size as 9 in bug 343449:
 1. Easy to read for multibyte language (but too large now).
 2. Unit of the font size is not clear.
    The font actually used in the installer seems to be 12px for ja, not 9px.
 3. Window size will change according to the windows system settting.
    On the other hand, window size was fixed with default font size.
 4. Only the main part of the installer will be enlarged.
    See the title "License Agreement" in page 2. It is still small and design
    (balance of the font sizes) are not good with font size 9.
 5. Images will be also enlarged according to the font size but it looks poor.
    See firefox icon in the top-right of page 2, which is blurred.

Form 2,3,4, I doubt if the installer font size is not treated correctly and what we should fix are:
  * Make the unit of the font size clear.
  * Chage font size of all the text according to the setting.
  * Fix the size of window, not depend on the system setting.
  * Include larger and clear images according to the font size.

After the fix of these in this bug, we localizer should file a bug to change font size par locale (if still needed).

7rd page of ja installer with font size 9

This screenshot shows one more problem about installer UI.

See the button "Install" in japanese (middle of the three buttons).
Button size of the installer/uninstaller is not flexible and not enough large for japanese. The button size should be enlarged in case the label is long.

If we use different short word for the button, it's not impossible to make the label within the button but it's meaning will be unclear and I want buttons to be flexible.

I think unfortunately he forgetted about this bug...

To make Chinese/Japanese/Korean Firefox installer look professional, I request blocking-firefox2.
# especially, obscure firefox log is not acceptable
# compare attachment 229558 and attachment 229563 in bug 344985
Nope... I haven't forgotten. There just isn't enough time to do everything that needs to be done. :(
Rob, I think this polish is important as it's the very first experience a user has with our installer. We can polish this after beta2 safely, though.
beltzner, wholeheartedly agree

Japanese installer's resource shown in ResHacker tool

FYI: Current font name setting seems not loaded correctly
This screenshot is taken with ResHacker tool:
http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/

In preprocess-locale.pl, loaded font name will be converted from utf-8
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/toolkit/mozapps/installer/windows/nsis/preprocess-locale.pl#91
but as highlighted in the screenshot, Japanese font name is written in funny code.
I doubt third argument of preprocess-locale.pl ($langCP) is not correct.
# I'm not sure since I cannot find the commandline for preprocess-locale.pl from lxr.
If you explicitly set the font using reshacker the same bug occurs. Like I stated in bug 344985 comment #12
This is actually caused by the changing the font from MS Shell Dialog to MS UI Gothic or equivalent for the entire ui since the MS UI Gothic font is not the same dimensions and changing the font size does not actually fix this bug. The fix will hopefully be setting the font at runtime as was done in the xpinstall based installer which would be the fix for bug 344476.
(In reply to comment #9)
> If you explicitly set the font using reshacker the same bug occurs. Like I
> stated in bug 344985 comment #12

Sorry my confusing post.
I never intend to set the font using reshacker.
I just wanted to tell you that current charset converting may be incorrect.
I posted last comment to avoid setting fontname with funny code when you set the font at runtime as was done in the xpinstall.
# If current charset converting of font name is correct, sorry and ignore my comment.

I doubt that
> 2. Unit of the font size is not clear.
>    The font actually used in the installer seems to be 12px for ja, not 9px.
is caused by funny fontname since:
 * dialog size will be small (correct size for 9px) when I fixed the font name
   to correct charset
 * dialog size will not change (still too large) when I changed font size
   (and keep font name in funny code)
Rob, if you don't have cycles, can you suggest an appropriate owner instead (aside from Seth, who's kinda getting piled on right now)
note: the reason we have to use MS UI Gothic is due to that "MS Shell Dlg does not work on East Asian versions of Windows 9x"

screenshot - ja installer cleaned up

The font used by these locales is significantly wider than western fonts which makes it so we have to use different image sizes. I should be able to finish up a patch tomorrow for this.

attachment #164462 in bug 266309 also shows the same approximate change in window size as is shown here. For Firefox 3.0 we won't have to do this since Win9x requires specifying the font while with newer OS's we can just specify MS Shell Dlg which will retain the correct window size.

Looks much better; Asai, do you agree?

Screenshots - zh-TW, zh-CN, ar, en-US

Screenshots of several installers for comparison. The zn-TW and zn-CN installers are slightly shorter due to the font height being slightly shorter which causes the inages to be slightly shorter as well. We could one-off the images for zn-TW and zn-CN the same way I am going to one-off the images for ja and ko but I would prefer not to.

Screenshots - ko and ja

All is working now and I'll submit a patch within 24 hours. Since the font used by ko and ja is significantly wider and shorter a new image is needed for the localized installers.
Thank you- this looks much bettter.

However, is there any way we can add in a bit of space between the lines of text? If we are concerned about the readability, it could be improved (although this is certainly not a blocker, just a request if it would be quick and easy.)

beltzner, I am very sure that none of these images are needed on the trunk so, could I get a 1.8.1= from you for them when you review them? Thanks
btw: I decided to go with an additional image for zh-CN and zh-TW since it just looks more professional for them to be sized correctly.

branch patch

Benjamin, this shouldn't be necessary on the trunk - I'm going to double check before committing to that but I have tested it before and it wasn't needed - since this is to support having one installer for East Asian locales. Win98 doesn't support mapping the MS Shell Dlg font for East Asian locales but newer versions do so we have to specify the font to support Win98.

I moved the font and RTL logic into preprocess-locale.pl because storing the UTF-8 font names for all of the locales in one file caused problems. Basically, the file could either be converted properly by iconv but locales.nsi could not be read by NSIS or it could be read by NSIS but iconv was unable to convert the ko font name from UTF-8 to CP949.
Robert, consider all of the images to be a=beltzner on behalf of 181drivers; I'm too lazy to mark them all. I'm not exactly sure why the wider fonts require different images, but I totally trust you to have not made all this extra work for yourself unless it was needed, and they all look fine to me (and won't make the download size any bigger as they're just being selected by the preprocessor, yes?) so I'm fine with putting them into the 181 branch.

Thanks!
It won't increase the size since only one of the images is used per locale. Specifying the font as something other than MS Shell Dlg is what causes the ui to be a different size which then affects the size of the image. We could change it to not resize to fit the image but that has the drawback of the image not being sized properly when using custom dpi settings, etc. or we could change the ui resources but that is a real PITA to maintain.
I'll submit a trunk patch later today that will be much simpler
Created attachment 237149
Trunk Screenshots - ja, ko, zh-CN, and en-US

On the trunk we can use MS Shell Dlg for the font of all locales since we don't support any versions of Win9x on the trunk. This makes it so the images are the same size, etc.

Trunk patch
As can be seen by the trunk screenshots using MS Shell Dlg is the way to go on the trunk since we don't support Win9x on the trunk

branch patch

This patch is only needed on the branch due to the branch supporting Win9x. The trunk patch below primarily removes code for supporting East Asian locales on Win9x
Checked in to trunk. There is no need for this to bake on the trunk since the branch patch is different due to needing to support win98
