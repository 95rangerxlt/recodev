The sysnumlines settings in firefox.js are incorrect.  sysnumlines should only
be true when the behavior is to scroll the document (action 0) and the delta
that comes from the system's event is desired.

0 = scroll lines, 1 = scroll pages, 2 = history, 3 = text size

Right now, on the Mac:
     withnokey.action = 0, sysnumlines = true  (OK)
    withaltkey.action = 0, sysnumlines = false (OK)
withcontrolkey.action = 2, sysnumlines = true  (should be false)
   withmetakey.action = 3, sysnumlines = true  (should be false)
  withshiftkey.action = 0, sysnumlines = false (should be true)

On Windows:
     withnokey.action = 0, sysnumlines = true  (OK)
    withaltkey.action = 0, sysnumlines = false (OK)
withcontrolkey.action = 3, sysnumlines = true  (should be false)
   withmetakey.action = 0, sysnumlines = true  (OK)
  withshiftkey.action = 2, sysnumlines = true  (should be false)

The preferences in app/profile/firefox.js should be adjusted accordingly.

The event state manager doesn't use the magnitude for history and text size. 
The only thing here that's required is the Mac shift key fix.  The other
bindings are less critical, but they still should be fixed for correctness. 
Users who wish to invert the axis for these events should be able to do so by
setting numlines to -1 and shouldn't need to touch sysnumlines.

Fix

This fixes the problem by flipping the sysnumlines setting where needed.  It
also explicitly sets sysnumlines to false for the alt key binding, to make it
clear that the behavior is intended, rather than relying on the value from
all.js.

Fixed fix

r=mano
Fixed on trunk.  This should be taken on the branch to clean up the shift on the
Mac situation introduced in bug 309730.
Fixed on the branch.
