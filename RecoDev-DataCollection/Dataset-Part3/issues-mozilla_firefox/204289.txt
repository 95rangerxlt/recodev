For a couple months Mozilla Firebird has had a nasty redraw bug on Windows XP
(and, I think, other Windows versions). For most of that time Mozilla-the-suite
has also had this same problem. What happens is that certain elements on the
page do not properly repaint when the vertical scrollbar appears. Then, for some
reason, Mozilla started functioning properly again. However, Firebird still
showed the same bug. So, I went looking into the problem and came up with a fix
that I have tested and found to work beautifully.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load URL (may require a slow connection; part of the page must show up before
the vertical scrollbar appears).
Actual Results:  
Part of the text is chopped off on the left and the horizontal rule extends
clear to the scrollbar. 


Expected Results:  
Firebird should have repainted the page properly.

The fix is to add the following lines to a .css file (I added them to
mozilla/toolkit/skin/win/scrollbars.css):

scrollbar[lazy="true"][collapsed="true"],
scrollbar[lazy="true"][moz-collapse="true"] {
  -moz-binding: none;
}

This makes pages paint properly again. I am not sure where the best place to put
this rule is--there doesn't seem to be an xul.css for Firebird. I would attach a
patch but 1) I am not set up to make patches yet and 2) I am not sure where the
proper place for this rule is.

I would appreciate it if someone could confirm this bug and get the attention of
someone who knows the best way to fix it.
.
The correct file for the fix to be added is mozilla/toolkit/content/xul.css. (I
was wrong about there not being an xul.css in Firebird.) The change should be
made around line 742.

I have been running with this fix for a while and it works perfectly. There
might be a performance win in making this change--the change in Mozilla was
intended to improve performance (by making lazy scrollbars).
This fix also solves bug 183954 for Firebird (that bug is also already fixed in
the Mozilla suite).

There are three copies of xul.css in the tree:
  mail/base/content/xul.css
  toolkit/content/xul.css
  xpfe/global/resources/content/xul.css

I guess dbaron already noticed this, but someone should say it out loud: the fix
for bug 202681 will get rid of this style rule everywhere, fixing this bug.
Unfortunately, the fix for bug 202681 did not fix this bug.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030522 Mozilla
Firebird/0.6

still shows the problem.
I've found the same bug on Windows 98 SE.  It was not present under Phoenix 0.5
Hmm...is this a duplicate of <a
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195598">bug 195598</a>?
This was fixed by a checkin from Robert O'Callahan (roc+moz@cs.cmu.edu) earlier
this week. Everything is working great for me now. Thanks for fixing this! I
will mark this fixed and add a comment to bug 195598 (which is also completely
fixed).
