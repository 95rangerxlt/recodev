I use smugmug for pictures.  In one directory, I have 6000 galleries or so.  It takes a very long time to load.  Profile, it shows that 62% of the time is in ssi_saveState(aUpdateAll).

We're fixing that in bug 838577 (and some related bugs).
gavin, that is a huge change.  do you think it's going to make 25?

How about we do something simple.  can we bail form ssi_saveStatestop() when the document is still loading?
Actually, it's probably going to be fixed in bug 867143, expected any day now.

Sounds like something worth investigating, but could be tricky to get right (balancing responsiveness with avoiding dataloss, e.g. if pages are "loading" a long time while you type in a form you don't want to lose all that data).
why would you be writing into a form while the page is still loading?  is that something?
It depends on which definition of "loading" you're using, so we'd need to pick one carefully. By some definitions some pages continue "loading" well after they're usable by users.

Given Yoric thinks 867143 is going to land soon, I don't think I care about something simple any more.
Bug 867143 has now landed. Doug, could you check whether this helps out?
yup.  fixed.  Yoric, nice work man.
