check the observer is actually for the page being tested

This is a bit of an edge-case, but if some other content is loading while browser_save_link-perwindowpb.js is running, the 'http-on-examine-response' and 'http-on-modify-request' observers in that test might see that other content and will fail (eg, it will see the cookies for this other unrelated content instead of the ones the test is expecting).

It is an edge case because in the normal case, no other content will be loading.  However, in bug 896912 we are investigating issues the background thumbnailing service might cause - and if background thumbnails are active during the tests we hit this issue (the test sees the responses from the b/g thumbnails).  As it is unlikely we will *actually* enable b/g thumbnails during all tests, it's probably OK to WONTFIX this - but the change is trivial and might come back later, so I figured it was worth opening this bug anyway.

Asking Monica for review as it looks like the observer was added in bug 857427.  Please feel free to pass on to someone else if desired (Ehsan looks like another good candidate :)

Thanks. I think it is a good idea to fix this ambiguity even if it hasn't triggered yet.
Thanks!

0001-Bug-915961-browser_save_link-perwindowpb.js-now-chec.patch

This was broken by the moving of the tests from browser/base/test to browser/base/test/general.  This required changing the 2 lines from:

+    if (channel.URI.spec != "http://mochi.test:8888/browser/browser/base/content/test/bug792517.sjs") {

to:

+    if (channel.URI.spec != "http://mochi.test:8888/browser/browser/base/content/test/general/bug792517.sjs") {

Given this is a trivial change, carrying r+ forward.

Is this something that would be sensible to uplift to the release branches or just let it ride Fx27? It's test-only, so approval isn't needed.
I am not finding any oranges associated with this test, so I think we can avoid the work of uplifting.
Discussed on IRC and decided to take it after all.

*sigh* And then I went and pushed the version that had the paths *with* /general in them. Fail.
