If target is non-null, why does it have a null messageManager?
So I believe the reason is that the element has been removed from the DOM tree. We still have a reference to it but after being removed it loses its frameLoader and the messageManager.

This is probably the same root cause for all the 3 bugs you've requested review. I think we need to first determine what is causing us to deal with items that are already removed from the DOM, before r+'ing these patches.

My first guess is tab closing...
I'll try and run the investigation. Any suggestion how to get started?
I guess finding the minimal testcase on how this happens.. You can them add some breakpoint; to the code and use the --jsdebugger option to start the test run with the debugger attached to try to find out where the trouble is
