The "sample" method also calls mozCancelAnimationFrame, which is slightly confusing. Can you either use your helper method everywhere, name it in a way that makes it clearer why sample doesn't use it, or just not add that method at all?

Ah, I missed that usage in "sample". I think "cancelAnimation" makes sense, but "endAnimation" or something similar would also work if you don't think cancelAnimation works.
