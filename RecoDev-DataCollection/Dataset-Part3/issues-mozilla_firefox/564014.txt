When I try to upload files (for example) to attach to an email in my gmail account, Firefox grabs another file in the same directory, but never the one I want.

I would expect to be able to upload the file that I select.

I tried to perform the same operation using Arora (http://code.google.com/p/arora/) and the action performed as I would expect.  This apparent bug has only happened since I upgraded to Lucid, yesterday.

Please let me know if I can help any further.

Many thanks for your good work.

Chris.
