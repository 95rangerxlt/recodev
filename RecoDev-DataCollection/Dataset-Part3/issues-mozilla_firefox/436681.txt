patch v1

If an extension adds another treeview in a groupbox in the General tab, this rule will have no effect:
  #metaTags > .groupbox-body {
    -moz-margin-start: 5px;
    -moz-margin-end: 1px;
  }

The treeview added by the extension won't be aligned with the first one listing meta tags.

The class "treebox" on the groupbox in pageInfo.xul was added with the purpose of allowing extensions to share rules with the meta tags view.

Florian: Does this patch need to be checked in?
Yes. I was going to do it, but I needed to get an hg tree, and then I forgot...
