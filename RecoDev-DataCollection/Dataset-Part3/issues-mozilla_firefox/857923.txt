There were some problems in the patch landed in bug 836452

-<!ENTITY social.activated.undobutton.label "Undo">
+<!ENTITY social.activated.undobutton.label "Oops, undo this!">

You can't do this, you need a new entity name if you want to change the original string.

<!ENTITY social.learnMore.label "Learn more...">
service.install.learnmore=Learn More...

AFAIK Mozilla consistently uses a single unicode character "…" instead of "...". This can be fixed without changing entity name, considering it's a matter of consistency inside en-US.

 # LOCALIZATION NOTE (social.activated.description): %1$S is the name of the social provider, %2$S is brandShortName (e.g. Firefox)
-social.activated.description=You've turned on %1$S for %2$S.
+service.install.description=Would you like to enable services from %1$S to display in your %2$S toolbar and sidebar?

The LOCALIZATION NOTE needs to be updated as well.


The following should rather use common placeholders. It should not include xml tags.

+<!ENTITY social.activated.description "Services from <label/> have been enabled. You can change your settings for services in the <label class='text-link'>Add-on Manager</label>.">

This is used elsewhere in dtd files (see abouthome.defaultSnippet1.v1, aboutSupport.pageSubtitle), but I'm fine changing it.  What do you suggest as common placeholders that could insert into dom as elements?
