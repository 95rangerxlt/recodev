Bug 308973 renamed trunk builds to "Minefield" and in bug 330533 sgarrity provided a cute new graphic that visually represents the expected stability of trunk builds. I'm not sure that we want to, but it might be cute to use that graphic as the shortcut icon as well.

This would require changing the .ico and png files in /browser/app, if I'm reading the build code correctly.

PNG Version of Minefield icon
I ran a build and confirmed that this works for OSX, at least (http://beltzner.ca/webdav/minefield.app.png) I *think* they need to be checked in as ..:

windows icon   ----> /browser/app/firefox.ico
PNG icon (gtk) ----> /browser/app/mozicon128.png
OS X icon ---------> /browser/app/macbuild/firefox.icns

(cc'ing bsmedberg and mconnor as they might know for sure)
Yes, they need to be checked in this way.

Perhaps adequate document icons would be nice, too?
Checked these in on the trunk.

Gavin, can you verify this on windows? That screenshot makes it look very much unfixed ... I can verify that the checkin makes it work on OSX.
At mine the icon is right - in own builds, in tinderbox builds and in the official nightly builds.

The bomb icon looks a bit off-center in the Mac OS X dock.  I mentioned this to Mike Beltzner and he said "I think the best way to resolve that would be to shrink it a bit more and pad it out with some empty space on the right side to offset the dynamite stick coming out of the left."

The correct icon appears on windows, using the latest windows nightly. The dynamite is kind of hard to see on a white background (windows explorer) and even as the window icon (16x16), but it's there.

On Linux, the icon is still the plain globe. In the firefox/icons/ directory I see a plain document.png, mozicon16.xpm and mozicon50.xpm. Only mozicon128.png has the new graphic. Can these 3 files be updated too?

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/app/mozicon50.xpm

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/app/default.xpm is also the plain icon.

I'm also not sure why http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/branding/icon64.png still exists.

Reopening to fix Linux icon issue.

Is this still an issue - will the bomb icon be used for nightly-builds indefinitely?
Alex, could you give us some help with this and/or point us in a direction?
We don't use XPM anymore, we use the pngs at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=495250 now.  

bug 495250 covers adding the 22/24/256 sizes that GNOME would like, but we have 16/32/48 now.
