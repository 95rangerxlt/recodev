Nope.
What's the significance of the version not changing? The Adobe download site (and about:plugins) report a full version of "10.3.181.22" (was .16). Should the full version be used here (and what makes use of this version number)?

This is live now
The significance for this bug is minimal. PFS is only consulted on an initial install, and is not used for updates. We could update it, but the important bits are the hash matching the .exe that is being downloaded (if they don't match, the user is pushed to the adobe site for a manual install).

 Version numbers have greater significance on plugin checks, as some browsers/platforms only report the first three digits.

Thanks Wil! much appreciated!

Dolske: One last thing, we could add the last version number to future updates, but it's descriptive metadata only for PFS.
Thanks for the quick turnaround folks!

Might be a good idea for clearity / record keeping. Though it sounds like it isn't actually used for anything.
