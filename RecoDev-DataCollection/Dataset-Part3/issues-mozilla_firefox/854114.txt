Steps to reproduce:
o Install the 23 March 2013 Nightly build.
o Install the Social Fixer extension. (Version 6.603 via the addons manager, or version 7.501 from <http://socialfixer.com/>.)
o Visit facebook.com.
o Log in.

Expected result:

Log into Facebook with Social Fixer and no errors.

Actual result (Social Fixer 6.603):

Three pop-ups saying "Error: syntax error" are created. Social Fixer is not loaded.

Actual result (Social Fixer 7.501):

1) A popup with the message "evalInSandbox:Error: Permission denied for <https://facebook.com> to create wrapper for object of class UnnamedClass" is displayed.
2) When the first popup is dismissed, a second popup with the same message is displayed.
3) Social Fixer is not loaded.


Both behaviors are observed with a new profile with no other extensions.

This problem did not exist with the 22 March 2013 and earlier Nightly builds.

Adding Social Fixer dev.
This happened in a previous release, and was fixed, but it popped up again? I know nothing about the source for Firefox, but perhaps the broken change snuck back in again...
Grepping through the SocialFixer source, my wild guess would be that this is the culprit:

sandbox.__proto__=sandbox.window;

There are a number of ways in which directly setting the prototype of a sandbox to a window won't work. We have special handling for the desired behavior here with the |sandboxPrototype| sandbox option. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Components.utils.Sandbox for details.

Give that a shot and let me know if the problem persists?

Thank you very much for the pointer to the specific problem. I've changed the code to pass a "sandboxPrototype" to the new Sandbox call, and it works now. But will this be compatible with older versions of FF?

I will move to Jetpack very soon. I just need to get a patch out sooner...

Yes. sandboxPrototype has been around for at least a couple of years.
FF just updated to 22 and now I'm getting this error.  Is there a way to back out the update?

I released an update to Social Fixer that resolves this problem.
Update from http://SocialFixer.com
Thanks, and sorry... I thought I had the latest Social Fixer release.  Side note.... I got a "Bad Request / 404" error trying to get to socialfixer.com using FF.  Had to get it with Chrome.
According to comment #7, it's fixed in Social Fixer 7.601.
