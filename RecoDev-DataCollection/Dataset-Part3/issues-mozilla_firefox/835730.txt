please file a bug in Firefox/General to use the fact nsBrowserGlue supports weak references, thus we can addObserver(,, true) and never RemoveObserver, that means we can likely kill _dispose() method, moving any remaining stuff to onProfileShutdown or onPlacesShutdown.

please while here remove the "Note" from the javadoc, since looks like it comes from an ancient time where we were finalizing at quit-application-granted.

Revised patch with changes added as per review in comment 2

The changes apply to comments only so I won't re-submit it to try; the previous run was all green except for what looks like an intermittent issue on WinXP.
