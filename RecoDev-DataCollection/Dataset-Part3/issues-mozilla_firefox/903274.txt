This seems to happen on most, if not all, windows during tpaint talos runs. I think the error happens because the callback is being called after the binding is destroyed.

I think this is mostly just log spew and probably doesn't have much impact elsewhere but correct me if I'm wrong.

I agree that this is probably harmless.

Can we set a "_destroyed" expando on the node from the XBL destructor, and then check it in the initialization callback? Failing that, we could just null check this.updateDisplay.
I see this same JavaScript error every time I run a debug Firefox build if I have customized Australis to remove the search bar.

That's strange. Search bar binding code shouldn't be running at all in that case...
Oh, unless you meant that you moved the search bar into the Australis menu panel - I see this bug then as well.
I see this error when I move the search bar into the Australis menu panel, but I confirmed that I also see this error when I remove the search bar.
Oh, I suppose the search bar is in the document to start with, until the customizable toolbar code removes it. It would be nice to find a way to avoid that somehow...
