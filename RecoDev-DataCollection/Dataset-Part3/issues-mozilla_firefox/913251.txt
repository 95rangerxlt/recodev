From the thinking outside the box direction.  I t seems to me that continuing to try to make this work si a losing proposition.  All new Windows systems I have seen for a few years are 64-bit systems coming with a 64-bit operating system.  Therefore it would seem that the direction we should be taking is to do what is necessary to make 64-bit Windows build production ready and the reference platform and do PGO builds for Windows on 64-bit only.  We should still continue to produce non-PGO builds targeting 32-bit users.  Just my opinion, but it seems to me trying to keep this working is wasting resources on the wrong thing.

This isn't the right bug to discuss how/why we do PGO the way we do. That being said, we *must* continue to support 32-bit Windows PGO builds for the foreseeable future.

I know that was hoping to get a where should I discuss this issue, and was not saying we should not support win-32 just maybe need to stop doing PGO on win-32.
MY point was people interested in running the latest/fastest are probably on a 64-bit OS by now.
This doesn't look like a linker memory issue, it just looks like an internal compiler error.

There were nightlies on https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=UX&rev=c7e2dcb1a8eb which are clobber + PGO, and completed successfully, so I think this is just: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=UX&rev=8fae116e85c5 which is https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/pushloghtml?startID=386&endID=387 .

Bisecting a merge cset isn't really my favourite job, but I'll start doing that shortly, as I don't see anything obvious in that list that'd cause this.

For https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/dd216d8a6a0a and its 50-odd csets: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=029f442194b6

For https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/47baeadc005b and its 80-odd csets: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=276f87efdd39

For https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/7c90e8e1b481 and its 120-odd csets: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=3cd6dca18e4b (with previous m-c merge followed by another m-i merge directly to ux, just for try).

Assuming I haven't screwed up, hopefully this will narrow things down. I have to say, as I was going through the list for these merges, that bug 730805 seems suspicious to me, but that's purely gut feeling...
Line 962 of nsDisplayList.cpp is a return statement in TreatAsOpaque, which returns an (empty) nsRegion. Looking at all the files touched by the csets that were merged, the nsRegion::Init change from bug 912054 jumped out, so I also fired off a try run where I speculatively back that out: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=33df960b3b8e

All of these are green. Assuming I didn't screw up my try pushes, and/or there isn't some stupid difference between try env and our UX env, this means the failure was introduced by the last 22-odd commits in the merge:

This is green too. It's in the range implied in comment #9, so it seems these results are saying this was the culprit. Can we just back this out of UX initially to see if Try isn't lying and this fixes things, and if so, back out of m-c and reopen the bug so people can figure out why this patch is breaking things? Ryan, asking you with your sheriff hat on! :-)
You can backout whatever you want from UX, it's not a sheriffed tree! :)

The try push in comment 12 also failed to link (see comment 15) so I'm going to go ahead with backing bug 912054 out once my m-c update is done. Nathan is on PTO today and BenWa was fine with this.

Assigning this to Gijs since he did most of the investigation.
