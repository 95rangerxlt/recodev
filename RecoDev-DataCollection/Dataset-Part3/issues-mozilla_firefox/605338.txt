This is a mitigation step until we can address bug 586155.  Copying over details for the change:

Nominating for blocking so we can make a decision.
Note, if we don't block on this bug, then we need to block on bug 607154
Any word on if this is a blocker? It would take care of bug 581726 in Panorama (as long as we don't land bug 586155 as well). The fix on our end is pretty non-trivial.

By turn off, we just mean flip the default pref. There's a GUI option for it (because some users really like it) so I think bug 581726 will need to be fixed either way.

Bug 586155 really should be marked wontfix. The feature requests there aren't possible with the current set of underlying taskbar apis. So tab candy/taskbar preview bugs shouldn't block on it.
Note for triage: we need to block on this due to bugs 581726 and 538487
Jim, can you flip the pref off?
Bug 556524 is caused by Aero Peek; we think we might have fixed it, but won't know until we get more crash-stats data.

Not sure what "Turn off Aero Peek until we can implement a delayed hover" means, but I would like to state that if Tab Preview is turned on and you hover your mouse over the preview for www.cisco.com, the entire Minefield window turns black.

The feature when you click on a taskbar item on Windows 7 (the preview of the active and inactive tabs).

This would be a separate bug.
