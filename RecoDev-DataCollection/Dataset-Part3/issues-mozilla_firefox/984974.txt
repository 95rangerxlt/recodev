There's a bad symlink in mozilla-central, and, while probably not wrecking the build, it's confusing DXR: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/082761b7bc54/mobile/android/base/resources/layout/.%23tabs_item_row.xml.

It looks like a temp link somebody accidentally committed, and it points to a nonexistent file. In the meantime, I'll make DXR tolerate that sort of thing, but it would be nice to remove it as well.

I wonder if we should have a Mercurial hook to prevent pushes with symlinks.
Sometimes it's useful to have symlinks in a tree, though I can't speak for moz-central. Ruling out bad ones, I could see.

Anyway, DXR tolerates this now: https://github.com/mozilla/dxr/commit/2a72a0dcb52a7cb6e65b7b28538551ba52da303f#diff-b2e84068fc3ddeabd100ce67fc9f481dL248. Amusingly, I just checked a bad link in on purpose to test this. :-)
symlinks are evil in any tree which needs to be checked out on Windows, which means all of our product code and most other things. gps please file a bug for a hook to prevent this.
