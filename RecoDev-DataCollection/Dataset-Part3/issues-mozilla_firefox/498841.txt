browserStartup is the wrong place for this, as the urlbar doesn't necessarily exist on startup.

While you're touching this code:

>+      document.documentElement.getAttribute("chromehidden").indexOf("toolbar") != -1) {

|toolbar.visible| would be so much easier to read...

IIRC that's not the same test, though I don't recall the distinction.
I don't think there's a difference... I recall researching this for bug 470051. A quick search now leads to this:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/nsBarProps.cpp#165
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpfe/appshell/src/nsXULWindow.cpp#2093

I won't change it in this bug, though.
