When going to the mentioned site and doing a print preview, the first table is
moved to page 2 (ie there's a big blank on page one after 'to execute the
command' and page 2 starts with the first row of the table) but when one then
does Print Pages 2 to 2, it prints out only part of the table (it prints the
correct row titles but starts with 'Backspace / Delete previous character.'
instead of 'Up / Move back one command in the history list.') Printing pages 1-2
gives the correct result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/debian/chapter/book/ch13_02.html
2. Do a Print Preview (I used A4 size paper) and check page 2 (table starts with
'Up/ Move back... ')
3. Do Print -> Pages 2 to 2
Actual Results:  
Table on printout starts with 'Backspace / Delete...' which is somewhere in the
middle of the actual table. In print preview the table is shown as being
entirely on page 2

Expected Results:  
Print as shown/rendered in 'Print Preview'

Generally spoken I'd suspect this to be more a Mozilla problem rather than a
Mozilla Firebird one - so did you already check this problem using latest Mozilla?
I will give it a second try using Mozilla Firebird + Windows XP.
I could reproduce with Mozilla.
