go to about:about

see that about:licence is listed twice, it should be once.
It's not listed twice:
We have about:license (American English spelling) and about:licence (British English spelling). It's actually one license.html file, which can be accessed from both addresses, and rewrites itself to use "licence" or "license". You can see the code by opening View Source.

This was introduced in bug 322000.

I'd consider it far too funny to remove, just like about:robots.
This is not exactly primary, user-facing UI.
There's even an extension which brings back about:kitchensink...
There's two ways we could play this:

1) Consider the dual appearance as an amusing artifact of our attempts to cater for all audiences. Laugh.

2) Say that the two are really alternate names for the same page, and it should only be listed once. Make the effort to fix it by adding a special case to the code which generates the lists. Question: which of the two do you remove?

I'd say 1) is by far the more sensible option.

And, of course:

3) Back out about:about so that smart people don't spend more time on this dubious feature.

But perhaps I am grumpy this morning!

Hah! This is just the beginning, see bug 538421, bug 538813 and bug 538890.
about:licence was broken by bug 568691, and has been removed finally by bug 641195. about:license remains.
