Attempt to mark 500ms-1000ms range.

When one wants to select are in a recorded timeline to “zoom in”, one drags mouse over the range from which to which one wants to “zoom in”.

If mouse during the drag goes out of timeline area, the selection will be cancelled and one will have to start zooming in anew. This should not happen and
zoom-in process should not be interrupted by mouse going out the area of timeline.

See video for demonstration.

Running into this frequently myself on all the timeline graphs (framerate, category).

Adding this to new perf tool tracking.
Yeah, this is Graphs.jsm being a bit dumb about what to do when a mouseout happens. We should fix this.

Meanwhile, you can scroll or click and drag to select offscreen regions.

Note that dragging also doesn't work. The same underlying bug prevents this, namely mouseout events killing a selection in progress.

This fixes the problem as I reported in Bug 1136848.  Just allow the selection to continue after mouseout and catch the case where the mouseup happens outside of the toolbox (in which case it never gets fired).  I'm not sure exactly what  the remaining code in _onMouseOut is doing and when it should be executed.

Sure why not. If it feels right it's right. Test maybe?

I'll add one.  I also noticed that the same problem happened when dragging an existing selection around, so I've added in support for that.

There are a couple other things I want to fix wrt to graph selection, but this handles the case of a mouseup happening outside of the toolbox in the case of selecting, dragging, and resizing an existing selection.

Actually now that I play with the patch some more, I notice that cursors aren't synced between graphs anymore.

I'm not seeing it - what are the STR?

Just move the mouse between graphs

Try this one.  Had to still clear out the cursor and input attribute on mouseout, but only if the mouse wasn't currently active (had a mousedown with no mouseup).

This still doesn't handle the case when the mouse moves from one graph to another. Do we want to fix that here, or in a different bug? I've been duping such bugs to this one, hoping the fix would be the same for everything. Apparently, it's not :(

Feel free to r+ if you think that should be handled in a different bug, but please file a followup and make it block perf-tool-papercuts.

I filed Bug 1145784 for this after discussing it and spending some time looking into it, since it seems that it's a separate issue altogether.

So as long as this try turns up green, I'd say let's proceed with the incremental improvement here and handle the graph movement separately: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=5277587d803f
