I have already tried nuking my tree and still get the same error.
Regression of bug 299557 ?
I believe it is indeed a regression from that patch since that patch was checked
in after my last successful build. 

To verify it's not my system, I nuked my tree and used a .mozconfig from
bluefyre (he's been building successfully in vs 2003) and I still received the
same error. 
Can you provide a full from scratch build log?  That error only shows that link
thinks hostmar.lib is invalid.

Full build log from failed build

Here is the full build log which you requested.
According to the log, every library that was created with 'lib' is throwing that
'non-native module found' warning.  I don't think this problem was caused by bug
299557 as the linking of the target mar.lib & the nspr libs (which weren't
touched by bug 299557) are throwing the same error.  Are you using the lib.exe
from VS2003?

According to my mozconfig I should be:

. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig

GLIB_PREFIX=J:/mozilla/w32build/vc7
LIBIDL_PREFIX=J:/mozilla/w32build/vc7

export MOZ_PHOENIX=1

No dupes found. Marking NEW.
That mozconfig doesn't say anything about the VS paths being used.  I built with
the free MSVC last night and it built mar.exe without a problem.

Alex, since when does "no dupes filed" mean "confirmed"?  Can you actually
reproduce the problem?

Hi Chris, I didn't mean to imply that I had personally confirmed the bug.
However, Christopher/bangbang is an experienced developer and I trust his
judgement on the nature of the bug; however, I still checked for dupes since
those can sometimes slip by.

Didn't mean to step on your toes, Chris.
> Alex, since when does "no dupes filed" mean "confirmed"? 

wasn't that always the case? http://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/unconfirmed.html

Ugh.  I thought we fixed that broken assumption a long time ago.  Why even
bother with the unconfirmed state then.  Sorry, Alex, my mistake.

Ok, so it isn't pointing directly to the lib.exe, but it NEVER has in the past
and all compilations were successful for over a year. What's changed in config
requirements, then, that would require a direct linking to the lib.exe located
in the VS install directory?


my current and never changes mozset

Sorry for so many consecutive updates, but it's definitely not an issue caused
by a missing lib.exe. After running my mozset, I can access lib from the command
prompt simply by entering "lib" as the command meaning the paths ARE configured
properly and the build would have complete access to the executable. 
I never said that lib.exe was missing.  I asked if you were using the correct
version.  The updater code is relatively new for starters.  Even without my
changes, the updater Makefiles will still create a static library using lib.exe
and link against that library.  

According to the build log, every static library being built in your tree is
throwing that warning message.  So even if you disable the updater code (via
--disable-updater), I'm pretty sure that you're still going to hit this problem
elsewhere.  Afaict, mar.exe just happens to be the first place in the tree that
we link against a Mozilla-built static library (vs import library).

/LTCG

For whatever reason, lib.exe does not like the format of some of the compiled
files.  Have you tried a build with the stock optimization flags? 

lib.exe version is 7.10.3077.

I just tried a build with disable-updater added to my mozconfig and it compiled
succesfully. Something has to be up with the updater code. My ONLY idea is that
maybe there's a call for precompiled headers in there just like the one I remove
in cvsroot\mozilla\js\src\xpconnect\src\Makefile.in.
Interesting. The libmar code is fairly small and I didn't see any precompiled
header directives in the Makefiles.  Maybe darin knows of any issues with
precompiled headers?

Can you reproduce the original error with the default build optimizations and
without --disable-updater?

Let me know what the default opts are and I will give it a whirl. I have a
little time tonight and tomorrow night so I can keep at it for you guys. For
now, I'm just going to release daily builds with the updater disabled. 
(In reply to comment #18)
> Let me know what the default opts are and I will give it a whirl.

just use --enable-optimize without any =".." stuff
I use VS.NET 2003, and I don't have any trouble compiling mar.c

There's no explicit use of precompiled headers in libmar.
Same errors with the default optimize command
Darin: what version of lib do you have on your system?

Also, this updater wouldn't need something like activeperl installed would it?

Set HOST_RANLIB 

Ok, I think I found the problem:

> ranlib hostmar.lib
> echo not_ranlib mar.lib

HOST_RANLIB is set incorrectly and whatever cygwin's ranlib does to the .lib,
at least one variant of VS2003 doesn't like it.  

Darin, out of curiosity, is HOST_RANLIB set to 'ranlib' or ':' on your system?

Different error after patch

The patch gives me this error now. 

However, this DID fix it and it compiled successfully when testing:
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=1598200#1598200
Damn, the error wasn't sent to the log and I need to get some sleep. However, it
was something about tier 2 or level 2. Sorry, if I could I would do it again to
get the error, but I need sleep now. 

HOST_RANLIB = :
I want to clarify a previous statement. I atcually get the same error even when
using the patch posted above. So far, only ozone's suggestion has worked.
I give up. Maybe i'm trying too hard, but ozone's suggestion doesn't work at
all. I think, last night, in my sleepiness, I accidentally mistook a successful
build with the updater disabled as one with it actually enabled.

To sum up, nothing has fixed this issue. 
Have you cleaned the <obj-dir>\modules\libmar\src and
<obj-dir>\modules\libmar\tools dirs? Delete the .lib files and to be safe the
.obj files.
Ok, I did further testing and took my time this time around. On a fully cleaned
tree, ozone's solution DOES work. On a competely clean tree, the patch above
DOES NOT work. I'm sorry for the confusion. I've been rushing myself and it
wasn't to anyone's best interest. So, yes, ozone's fix does work 100%. The patch
does not.

fail with patch

The patch gives me the following output. I did not log the whole build, but
this is everything from the command window.
Afaict, you're hitting a separate problem there since it's dying in modules/zlib
& not even reaching the updater code.   It looks like modules/zlib/Makefile
wasn't generated.  

And don't forget to run autoconf after applying the patch to configure.in. 

autoconf? I did not know about this. Simply run the command by itself or what?
Any changes to configure.in require you to run autoconf (2.13) to regenerate
configure.  I generally don't make patches against configure because it's a
generated file and the patches often conflict since the slightest change in
configure.in causes a huge change in configure.

Cygwin comes with autoconf wrappers which usually pick the correct version of
autoconf so you can just run 'autoconf'.

autoconf comes up as an unrecognized command.

Next time, I'll make sure I'm inside bash :shame: I'll try it again and get back
to you. 
The patch worked. Thank you. I'm hoping now that it can be landed as long as it
doesn't break anything for people who did not have this issue.

Side question: running a make clean won't undo what autconf did right? My batch
file runs a make clean and I need to know if I'll run into issues with that or not. 
Comment on attachment 189017
Set HOST_RANLIB 

To undo the change, you'd have to remove configure & cvs update or unapply the
patch & re-run autoconf.  A simple `make clean` or even `make distclean` will
not affect it.
Thank you for your help man. The level of building/patching we had to go into
was something I was a little untested in and I'm sure I got annoying at times,
so thanks for sticking it out. I'm just glad I can start pumping out daily
builds again. 
No need to thank me.  I'm a firm believer in "You broke it; you fix it".  Sorry
about the trouble.  The patch has been checked in.
