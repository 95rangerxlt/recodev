With the latest nightly on trunk the session restore page doesn't come up anymore on OS X. It is working fine on Windows but on OS X you will end-up in an endless loop if one of your open web pages causes the crash. I've seen this today during investigation of bug 481060. Every time I start this profile the crashy website is loaded again. I'll check if 1.9.1 branch is affected too.

Looks like that something is broken in the sessionrestore.js. I'll try to nail it down and add it afterward as testcase.
With the testcase I have right now it's also reproducible on Windows.
I guess this is due to the backout of bug 395488. Henrik, can you reproduce this issue with a build older than 2009-02-27?
Regressed between the builds 09022702 and 09022802. That will fit into the timeframe of the backout on bug 395488.
Is this still applicable or can we close it? It sounds like it was just caused by the backout which was since checked back in.
Haven't seen this again. Lets call it fixed by bug 395488.
