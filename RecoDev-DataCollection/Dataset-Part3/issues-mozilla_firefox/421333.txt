The tests for this bug seem broken, to me.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug409481.js#6

adds a load listener which is an anonymous function using setTimeout to call openPanelURL, but the corresponding removal code:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug409481.js#17

removes openPanelURL directly.  This will not throw, since removing a non-existent listener is a no-op, but it means that there is a lingering listener on the sidebar.  The same pattern occurs with the addition of the runTest listener.

This is likely to create future problems, if more tests are added which exercise pageload in the sidebar.
