We support turning on the PB mode from within the preferences UI, so I think this should block 4.0 (especially since that it's a really easy fix).

Wasn't sure if the open() change made sense, but I see we already disable Tools -> Stop Private Browsing when in permanent PB mode, so it's consistent with that.

Current latest-trunk always shows "Enter private browsing" entry in jumplist when permanent PM mode is enabled. Is that ok? Is that a regression?
When firefox is closed and I select that entry, firefox will not open. Otherwise (when firefox is already open) nothing happens.
