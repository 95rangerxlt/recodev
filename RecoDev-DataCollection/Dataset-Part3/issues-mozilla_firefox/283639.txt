Go to Tools -> Sanitize Firefox... 

Make sure the "Ask Me Before Sanitizing Firefox" checkbox is ticked.

Try to clear History or Cache by having their tickboxes ticked, then click
"Sanitize Now"

Nothing Happens. If the "Ask me..." is unticked, then the option works as
normal. If it IS ticked then I would expect a dialogue to pop-up saying, "Are
you sure you want to clear these items? [Yes]/[No]"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> Sanitize Firefox
2. Tick "Warn Me" button
3. Click "Sanitise Now"

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
History and Cache should be cleared, for example, after warning the user what is
about to happen
