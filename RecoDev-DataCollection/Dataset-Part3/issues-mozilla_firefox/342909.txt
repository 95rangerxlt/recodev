The tab scroll buttons need a "button" appearance on mouse over - it at the very least needs an outset frame on hover and a click down appearance, right now they look like static icons and offer no feedback when clicked.

Wouldn't this look a whole lot better if the chevron was centered in the "button"?  The screenshot doesn't look very appealing IMO.

re-assign to asaf, as he's fixed this.
Asaf - should we mark this as fixed?

Ask beltzner ;) I think we're in a better shape now, esp. on windows; we might need further tweaks (e.g. better arrow images, a pressed state for the arrow buttons).
Agreed. Now that the buttons disable themselves, all we need is new art, and that would be a new bug.
