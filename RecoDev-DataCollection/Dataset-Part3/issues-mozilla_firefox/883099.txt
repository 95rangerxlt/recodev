Using the add-on NoSquint, when I open a new tab, then open a URL in that tab, the NoSquint setting is not preserved. This occurred around June 1 or shortly after. I am using nightly builds, and there was no new version of NoSquint, so this is likely the result of a change in how Firefox opens new tabs with nothing in them.

I do not get the problem if I right-click on a link and then select "open link a new tab". That works.

If I open a new tab first (from the File menu, or with ctrl-t) and then try to open a page in that tab, I do get the problem (as I said). And, when I first open the tab, the NoSquint setting in the add-on bar (like the status bar) at the bottom shows briefly as 100% and then turns into N/A. It is usually set on 150%. Thus, I think the problem is in whatever opens the new tab, not in the page loading.

If I open the url before the N/A appears, the new page opens correctly and the setting returns to 150%.

I have reported this to NoSquint, and a few others have confirmed that they have the same problem:

I just discovered a work-around:

In about:config, change
browser.newtab.url to blank, that is, click on that setting and hit the enter key. The "about:newtab" disappears. The images that used to appear in the new tab do not appear, but that is a small price to pay for getting NoSquint to work. (As Firefox users get older, NoSquint will be used more and more.)
This is caused by new tab page preloading.

fire TabOpen after swapping docShells for preloaded newtab pages

NoSquint listens for TabOpen, like probably hundreds of add-ons. We should of course switch docShells before firing the TabOpen event - I should've thought of that.

This fixes the described issue for me and NoSquint works as expected.

fire TabOpen after swapping docShells for preloaded newtab pages

Sorry I got the patch description wrong. We of course need to fire TabOpen *after* docShells may have been swapped.
