Had to disable the shockwave URL test in browser_webconsole_network_panel.js for bug 589089 which was failing consistently in try server.

Filed bug 603617 with releng to verify the installs on the machines in question and when that's closed, we should be able to reenable the test.

Is this still a problem? do we need to load a flash file in a test?
fixed some time ago.
