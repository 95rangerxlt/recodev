Build ID: 20131009055629

Steps to reproduce:

In options of editor i prefer view colors in hex mode, but this is not important. 

I want to see a page what contains some style like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<style type="text/css">
div {background:url('http://eu.battle.net/d3/static/images/item/icon-bgs/orange.png');}
</style>
<div>something</div>



Actual results:

When I inspect element in Inspector it shows me this style for div:
url("http://eu.battle.net/d3/static/images/item/icon-bgs/#FFA500.png") ...;
so URL became invalid, the orange.png became #ffa500.png.


Expected results:

it should not find color keywords inside url() block.

This sounds like bug 923884. It should be fixed if you update to the current nightly.
Thank you, I've updated nightly, but no. This is different bug. 
In bug 923884 they fixed replace in markup view. In Inspector, bug still exists in 27.0a1 (2013-10-13)
Right. It seems to be OK in the markup view but it's shown wrong in the styles box (Rules and Computed). Is that what you mean?

Could you attach a screenshot of it, just to be clear where the problem is?

orange.png looks like #FFA500.png
Thanks. It looks like a similar problem to bug 923884, but affecting the style inspector rather than the markup view.
