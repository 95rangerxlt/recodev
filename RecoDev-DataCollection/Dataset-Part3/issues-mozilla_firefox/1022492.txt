I managed to reproduce only with 1.3 so far. It has been reported by other people as well.

- Launch simulator 1.3
- Install an app from app manager (only tested with the new app manager)
- App is correctly installed *and* launched
- the app manager times out

Client side, once the app is installed, we launched it and wait until we get a "project-is-running" notification. Which we apparently don't get.
