This seems backwards compatible with older servers. I have tried adding a new rule on an older server, worked fine. I also did the backwards procedure (adding a new rule from an older server), worked fine as well.

Thanks, looks good overall - just a few notes

Could this be a race condition waiting to happen?  If there are multiple locks that need to be removed then in theory this event could fire for the first one but not quite be done for the second/third when the function returns.  Maybe we should be scoping onRefresh and the yield inside of each of these if (view.fooCheckbox.checked) blocks.

This should be "nullable:array:string" so the request doesn't fail if no argument is passed in.

LGTM if the try push is green
You may want to re-push to try. There were a bunch of infra issues and it looks like it's preventing some of the tests on your try push from ever finishing, and I'm not sure if they can be re-triggered from the messed up state.

The Windows and OSX try pushes are passing. Is that enough or should I push again to try ?

I think you should push again since not all the tests are actually running from the looks of it.
