"Server Push" is a popular method for webcams and their software
to present a continuous stream of images on a web page. It is the
fastest, easiest and most efficient way to do this! Even better,
you don't need any javascript code to update images on your web page
nor do you need any plugins to receive the stream.

This is accomplished by sending JPEG images in a content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace document.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://78.158.111.87/control/faststream.jpg?html&stream=full&fps=25
2. Check Firefox memory consumption with task manager of your choice

Actual Results:  
memory consumption rises slowly and monotonously until system memory is used up.

Expected Results:  
memory consumption should be stable.

Bug first seen in FF 3.6.10

Bug seen on MacOS X and Windows XP.
Memory increase is about 0,2 MByte / second.
Can't see this in -safe-mode
I am assuming this is a FireBug problem.
It's filed in FireBugs own bug tracking tool, see

http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=3221
Reports say, Firebug 1.6b2 fixes this problem.
