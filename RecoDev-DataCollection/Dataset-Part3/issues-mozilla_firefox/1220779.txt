Currently our language for permissions and preferences for Push is bases on the idea that a site can send notifications and a user can receive them. In on of other labels that may be read by a screenreader in 

https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd#204

the string says : 

"Change whether the site can receive notifications"

It should say: 

"Change whether the user can receive notifications from the site"

It should say: 

"Change whether the user can receive notifications from the site"
Some of the other accessibility strings include "you," so it may be confusing to refer to the user in the third person here.

How about "change whether you can receive notifications from the site," or "manage receiving notifications from the site" (to match auto-fill and WebRTC)?
"Change whether you can receive notifications from the site"

works for me.

wontfix for 44 due to string changes
One can always receive notifications if the site and browser support them and could block/disallow them which is quite different form "Change whether you can receive notifications from the site"â€¦
