Open CNN.com
Put the Subscribe button in the panel
Click on the Subscribe button

Expected:
Since there are more than one feeds available, there should be a subview shown

Actual:
Need to click and hold to get a popup to show the feeds, and accessing the popup is awkward.

I'll try taking a stab at this.

So this fixes the issue by migrating to the widget API. Changes to the API:

- widget.onCreated to be notified once a widget is created. Our existing infrastructure takes care of updating the button's disabled state on navigation, however, I believe we can get rid of calling FeedHandler.updateFeeds after customization. I've not added that change in here because I'd like someone to sanity check that assumption of mine.

- widget.onCommand's handler should be called handleWidgetCommand, and we should support handleWidgetClick for cases where toolbar buttons want to handle eg. middle click. This is now widget.onClick (I know, surprising).

- widget.onViewShowing can call preventDefault() on its event and have the view not shown.


Change for the feed button: this now means we show a panel rather than a popup menu in the case of multiple items. As we're doing that for the downloads manager anyway, I think this isn't a big deal, but maybe people disagree! :-)

(NB: note for the Europeans about comment #0: you want http://us.cnn.com/. http://edition.cnn.com (?!) which is the international version only has 1 feed. Surprise!)

Unbitrotting after l10n updates; also including l10n strings rather than hardcoding them...

This appears to be the wrong patch.

Why are all these bugs I'm working on having similar bug numbers (they both started with 8704!)

This was surprisingly straight-forward. Great job, Gijs!

Just two suggestions.

Let's call this commandHandler.

I think I want onCreated to get passed the node that's created, as opposed to having it be this. I think that's more in tune with the other functions we can declare here.
