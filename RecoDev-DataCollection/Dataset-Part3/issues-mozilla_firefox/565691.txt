With todays update this bug came (it wasn't there yesterday, when the new AOM had landed). It is annoying because I love my browser to be set in my own language.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- Open 20100513 Minefield 3.7a5pre
- open about:config
- set general.useragent.locale to de
- Open a new window or close and restart browser
Actual Results:  
There is a message "XML-Verarbeitungsfehler"... Chrome://Browser/content/browser.xul line 1597, column 5 <toolbar id="TabsToolbar"> (Message is German - I have tried to translate it)
Browser can't be opened

Expected Results:  
Browser should be open normal (as in English version) and the message shouldn't appear

PLEASE BE CAREFUL: WHEN YOU DO NOT OPEN A NEW WINDOW BUT RESTART THE BROWSER YOU HAVE TO OPEN SECURE-MODE TO CHANGE GENERAL.USERAGENT.LOCALE BACK TO EN!!!

Are there old de.jar and de.manifest file in install folder?
If exist, delete them.
I have deleted them both but the error has happened again.
With the newest nightly the error has changed and says something about the inspector. I wait for the German version and try this one. I will post here then.
Tried and failed. The new error is:
XML-Verarbeitungsfehler: Nicht definierte Entit√§t
Adresse: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
Zeile Nr. 215, Spalte 5:    <key id="key_inspect" key="&inspectMenu.commandkey;" command="Tools:Inspect" modifiers="accel,shift"/>
----^
Downloaded the newest de.jar and de.manifest but still nothing. The bug does still exist.
Made a new profile and bug is fixed.
