Hovering over the padlock icon in the location bar doesn't give any information.

Hopefully we can come up with something that explain, in plain english, that
both tells the user that they're in a secure session as well as telling them
what clicking the icon does.  Perhaps it's too hard to fit all that into a
single tooltip.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
2. Hover over padlock icon in location bar


Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
Tooltip explaining that site is secure and I can click for security details.

Suggestion for tooltip: 'View security information for this page'

This is a usability-related enhancement.

Just realized that we do have a tooltip for this in 1.0. This might have
something to do with us adding the RSS icon to the location bar...
Okay. I verified this regressed when we added the RSS icon to the location bar,
and philor pointed out this was caused by the change made to autocomplete.xml
