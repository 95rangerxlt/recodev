I just installed Firefox 2.0 the other day and from the very start it stops responding when trying to download files or trying to clear private data. I need to end task with windows task manager to exit. I am running Windows XP Home, 5.1.2600 Service Pack 2 Build 2600. I am not sure what other info you need, please let me know what else is needed if anything? 

Reproducible: Always

Please try deleting the file downloads.rdf in your profile.
Other possible solutions:

- Firefox's safe-mode to exclude extension/theme problems
- a reinstall in a new empty folder
- a new profile

Just wanted to add, I deleted the downloads.rdf file and as of now it is working correctly.  Thanks again!
