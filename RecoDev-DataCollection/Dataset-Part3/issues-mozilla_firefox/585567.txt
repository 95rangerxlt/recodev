The alternate style view contains a “Huh?” link by “Show specificity”. This should:
- Go somewhere useful, perhaps a page on MDC
- Be phrased in a way that wider Mozilla are happy with. “Huh?” is kind of fun, but perhaps it is more fun that we are happy with.

we'll need to figure out the i18n story for this as well...
I don't even understand the bug report.
Can we get some screenshots attached?

The 'Huh?' link
I'd go for a plain '?' as link title, but localized. The link should go to a target that does the right thing based on accept-lang, IMHO.
I've created https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Specificity and made the link to that page.
The page will need review.

I've also made the show specificity link work.
I've not fixed the I18N parts of this, however since that's being tracked by bug 585569, I'm marking this done.
