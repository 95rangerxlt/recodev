Bug 580512 seems like the likely culprit, we might be doing unnecessary work when collecting the session data.

Did we see this regression go away?
I haven't seen an e-mail about it. Is this thing represented somewhere on <http://graphs.mozilla.org/dashboard/?tree=Firefox>?

No, you'll have to look at the graphs.  If this didn't fix it, we should back out this and the original changeset to see if the regression goes away to make sure that it properly identified the cause.

I can't, it's unusable for me. It won't draw graphs.

Then we either need to do what I said in comment 6, or find someone that the graphs work for.
