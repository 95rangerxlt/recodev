When highlighting an item in the toolbar (this bug also applies to using 'showInfo' on a target), highlight & info panel positioning breaks when the browser is resized down to a width where the icon moves into the "More tools..." overflow panel.
Matt: Is this a regression, or did we just never implement this?

Seems like the current code knows how to deal with opening the menupanel when items are there, so maybe this isn't too hard to fix. If not I'd also consider a wallpaper patch to just highlight the overflow chevron.
I tried to look for an existing bug this morning but I guess there wasn't one as I couldn't find it under the fx-UITour meta bug. I thought it came up before though.

The hard part would be if we wanted to handle something moving into or out of the overflow panel while it's getting highlighted e.g. if the window resizes. It seems like we currently have a problem in that case and when we highlight something already in the overflow panel. The latter case probably isn't too hard to fix as I believe we can use the attributes that get set and the worst case is that we traverse up the tree to find the container.

The popup container is #widget-overflow and the children get the @overflowedItem attribute we can check on the widget container. There is also the @nav-bar-overflow-button attribute that we can use to know which popup to open automatically I think.
Note that we also have code that's supposed to avoid showing an annotation if the target isn't visible and it seems like that could use some improvement too.
Is there any scope to get this fixed, or at least a workaround in the short-term? 

There is a risk that if we highlight something (e.g. privateWindow), and if the user has a lot of icons, it could potentially be in the overflow?

If this would be easy enough to do, it would be better than showing a broken doorhanger / highlight icon.

Patch v.1

Simple (?) workaround to just highlight the overflow button when the target is in overflow.

I know there's a short timeframe to be able to land this, so rather than do a test here and hold up landing, file a followup bug for a test?

Testing in Nightly this only seems to be partly fixed. Two issues remain:

1.) If the target is in the overflow panel, the highlight is correct, but the associated door-hanger is still wrongly positioned. (see attachment)
2.) Highlighting still breaks when resizing the browser
Since this has already been uplifted, it's easier to track this info panel positioning in another bug.
I filed bug 1091785.
Setting qe-verify- since remaining issue is tracked separately.
