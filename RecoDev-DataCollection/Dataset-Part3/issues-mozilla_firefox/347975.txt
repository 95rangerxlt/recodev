Clicking the down arrow next to the back button makes both the back (left) arrow section and the down arrow section darken.

Clicking the down arrow next to the forward button only makes the forward (right) arrow section darken.

The forward button needs to darken on the down arrow section, too.

the forward arrow darkens the dropdown area if the forward arrow part is clicked on.  If the dropdown arrow is clicked on, then the dropdown section is not darked.  This seems to be like the intended behaviour but backwards?  Clicking on the arrow should darken the whole button one way (as clicking on the back button behaves), clicking on the dropdown marker should darken the dropdown section (as it does when you click the forward arrow).
