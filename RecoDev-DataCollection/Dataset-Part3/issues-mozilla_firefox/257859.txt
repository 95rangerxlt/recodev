Only enhancements to the Alternate Stylesheet functionality and UI remain now,
any chance we can have it back by default in Firefox? I know Blake's post is for
the purpose of debating, but I figure it needs a bug and votes to make any
difference now (since the post is rapidly degenerating).

Please don't wontfix this unless you intend to permanently remove the AltSS
functionality and/or UI.

Reproducible: Always

Patch to remove #ifdef SHOW_ALT_SS_UI

Clearing review request to me since this is a policy decision rather than a
code decision.
...and I'm not the one in charge of the policy in question.
"Please don't wontfix this unless you intend to permanently remove the AltSS
functionality and/or UI."

The decision was made to pull this feature from the Firefox 1.0 branch. The
functionality and/or UI will remain on the trunk, though I expect the UI to
change before the next major Firefox release.
We're going to revisit this today, based on fantasai et al.'s progress on the
bugs that caused altSS to be removed.

/be
Reopening. Setting nomination flag for PR since we'll want to get this in before
PR if we add it back.
ok, we agreed to take this for PR.  dbaron will check in.
fixed, after discussion at aviary meeting and approval of brendan, ben, etc.

In particular, see bug 262065.  It sounds like they decided to make this less
visible until style selections can be made "sticky", which I can't blame them
for: the behavior isn't intuitive as it stands, and could frustrate new users.

>>From Asaf Romano  2004-10-28 04:31 PDT  [reply] -------

Final answer, yes it has been hidden from the somewhat confusing and frustrating
statusbar UI, yes it has a reason, no it will not be fixed/changed for 1.0, yes
it will be back in future release, no we do not know which release yet.
why not add a check box in Tools, "Options..." for changing this?
e.g. "display alternate stylesheet UI in taskbar"
Now this has to be re-enabled since it was disabled by the aviary landing on the
branch. It is one the todo list in the "branch landing wiki"

Excuse me, I'm trying to track the history of this feature, do you know the bug num for the move to View->Page Style?
