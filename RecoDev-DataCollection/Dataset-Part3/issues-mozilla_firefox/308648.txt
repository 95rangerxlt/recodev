In print preview or even after printing it, pictures e.g. on page 11 and 12 of
preview are cut. If two pictures are horizontally next to each other, the first
part of the left picture is printed on the first page and on the following page
there is blank space for this part. The right picture is printed correctly
non-cut on the second page. This problem is in all versions!
It would be a lot better, if both pictures were printed on the second page only
and on the first page there is a bit blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open print preview
2. go to page 11/17
3. there is the problem at the bottom and the rest is on the above part of page 12
(at the end of page 12 the same happens again)
This happens on other pages, too.

Actual Results:  
The left of the 2 pictures is half on page 11 and the second half is on page 12
under a blank part, where the first part of the picture should be.


Expected Results:  
Both pictures printed on page 12! The same should happen, if there's only one
picture at the end of the page. Only if pictures are longer than page this is
after a question: "Do you want to scale it down, or print it over to pages?" ok.
For scaling "image zoom" extension is available.

This happens on every page with pictures at the end of the page!

Hello,
I have the same problem with a Flash site I produced - so I know what is going on. 

Go to http://www.gingerman.co.uk/itssolved/index.html

The top of the animation is viewable and the bottom half cuts off completely.

Flash is not the culprit - I have checked this in Safari, IE and Firefox, and
also on Mac and PC. Firefox fails on both Mac and PC.
The Flash plugin 7 an 8 have been tested and they only fail in Firefox.

What flash is doing - it detects the size of the movie - which is changed
initially by some javascript to fill the screen.
When the movie detects that change it resizes the Flash Movie in the page and
scales up a 1 pixel wide jpg of the gradient in the background so it fills the
screen on the width.
Also the main graphic area is centred, whether it be the preloader which is
updated every 10ms on an interval and uses the drawing API to draw it, or whther
it be the main site which listens for a stage size change and then does some
simple maths and centres itself accordongly.

This is such an odd bug, but if someone needs my code to check things then
please get in touch.

Regards

Stephen Matthews
