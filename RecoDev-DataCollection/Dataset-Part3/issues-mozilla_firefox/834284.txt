General spec: http://cl.ly/image/3q1d3q0J1Z3e

Right now, the patch in bug 823176 doesn't draw the border between the tabstrip and the navbar. There might be a few other issues here to deal with - I'll be tracking and fixing them here.

f=me for now because of the question about the border. Otherwise the patch looks good.

Where does the border come from without LWT and how does it differ from this? (i.e. why isn't this selector added to an existing ruleset). I looked quickly through the stylesheet and with DOMi.  Is it a moz-appearance?

.tab-background-middle[selected=true]:-moz-lwtheme should be sufficient for the rule (unless there's an issue with specificity)

Note to self: look into whether the ".tab-background-middle[selected=true]:-moz-lwtheme" rule should be removed from tabs.inc.css if it ends up differing on each platform.

Ah, good point - it turns out that what I really want here is a box shadow that was (up until now) skipped if using a lw-theme. I've extracted it, and now it's always applied.
