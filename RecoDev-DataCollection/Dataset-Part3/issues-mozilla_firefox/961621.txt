Try push for a patch I wrote: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=960215679a6c

I rewrote the test to be (much) simpler and easier to follow.

Try push was green. This test still used waitForSuccess() which caused problems with slow machines. Rewrote the test to make it much simpler because the webconsole and the debugger implementations have improved a lot - much easier to listen for the events that matter for the test.
