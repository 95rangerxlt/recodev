patch v1

Please remove the test, it's not useful.

patch v2 (removed test as requested)
There's also browser_tabview_bug594176.js, which will probably fail with this change.

patch v3 (test for bug 594176 updated)

Sorry I was a little bit too hasty. Is it ok to just update the test for #594176?
You can update the test or remove it, as I think it will just continue to be a hurdle rather than catching a regression...

patch v4 (test for bug 594176 removed)

Ok, I removed the test.
Don't forget the tests' Makefile.in.

Sorry, you're absolutely right.
