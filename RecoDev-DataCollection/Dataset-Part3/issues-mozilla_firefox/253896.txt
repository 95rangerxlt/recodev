I build firefox from the trunk CVS source on my Fedora Core 2.
In the latest trunk, we cannot select any applications in file opening dialog
and cannot open files with any application even if clicking the OK button.

In my test, 2004072606_trunk works properly and 2004072707_trunk not.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. click the link to the file which needs external application.
2. file opening dialog apears.
3. try to select applitaions
4. select "Open with" and click "OK" button to open it.

Actual Results:  
1. We cannot select external applications in file opening dialog.
2. We cannot open files with any programs.

Expected Results:  
1. We can select external applications in file opening dialog.
2. We can open files with any programs.

I also built seamonkey from 2004072606_trunk and 2004072707_trunk source and
test it.  Both of the trunk can select applications and open with the external
programs.

So I think this is the firefox-specefic bug.

I also checked Firefox on MacOS X 10.3.4 and the same problem happens.
Hardware -> All
OS -> All
Version -> Trunk

I never checked this problem at aviary build.
If aviary build also have the same problem, this bug should be set the Flags to
blocking-aviary1.0PR and Priority to P2 or higher.
Is this problem concerned with the fix of the bug 250938 that checked in at
2004-07-26T13:56?

The file is mozilla/ toolkit/ mozapps/ downloads/ src/ nsHelperAppDlg.js.in
Rev.1.10.
I built and tested with 2004080805_trunk and it seems to be worked fine.
