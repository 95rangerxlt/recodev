Developer forums make mention of a new version. It's also mentioned that the current version does work in FF3, but needs a version bump.

OK, would it be sufficient to have an editor review it on Fx3 and then flip the maxVer if it works?
We are planning on having a new version available for the release of FF3, but flipping the max version would be fine in the interim.

I went ahead and did this after testing on the latest nightly. Forecastfox is now claiming 3.0b4pre support.


How about pushing to 3.0 if it works as RC1 of FF3.0 has been released?
We have a new version that is Firefox 3 compatible.  It's currently on the Mozillazine forums http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=656423  We are planning on posting it on AMO in a couple of days.

If you could push that now -- that'd be great! Let me know if you need any help clearing the review queue.
I'll post it to AMO tonight after I get home from work. In the meantime, I've updated the maxVersion on the currently available Forecastfox 0.9.6.
Great! thank you!
