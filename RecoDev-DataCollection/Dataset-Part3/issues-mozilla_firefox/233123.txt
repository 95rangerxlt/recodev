See steps to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://icc.intrcomm.net
2. Log in as u: demo p: demo
3. Click the log out link below folder tree

Actual Results:  
FireBird goes bye bye.

Expected Results:  
Not shutdown.

When you click log out these PHP calls are made.  If I removed the Location:
header or meta refresh it does not crash.

session_destroy();
echo '<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=index.php">';
#header("Location: index.php");

Tried getting headers with the Live HTTP headers extenstion but the crash wipes
them out.

If I have 2 logins saved for the page http://icc.intrcomm.net/ the crash does
not occur it asks which login to use.
WFM build 20040131, please retest with a newer build, 0.7 is now quite old.
If you dont wanna try out nightly builds, then wait til monday, when (maybe) 0.8
will be released.
Works fine with me on Windows XP machine
Build: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206
Firefox/0.8

Maybe a platform dependant issue.
Tried with .8, works fine.
