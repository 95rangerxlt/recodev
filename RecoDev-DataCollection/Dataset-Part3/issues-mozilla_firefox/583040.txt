The inspector should have a better highlighter, similar to the one from the mockup in:

The idea is to have a translucent layer covering all of content with the area under inspection "punched through" the layer, revealing it.

This also will give the inspector a surface to draw guides on top of to illustrate layout and positioning information, as well as coordinates and possibly relationships with other elements in the hierarchy.

Requesting blocking status for this bug, as we do want a polished appearance for the Inspector in 4.0 final.
Not blocking - would gleefully approve a safe patch since I want the pretty, but this could be scary and there's a lot of blocking inspector work already.
