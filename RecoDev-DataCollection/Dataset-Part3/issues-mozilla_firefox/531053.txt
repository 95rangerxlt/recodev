Fix NetworkPrioritizer location

This patch solves the problem.
Is it found later? You can run |Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm")| in the error console. If it works, you should get a [object BackstagePass] and if it doesn't, you'll get an error.

I haven't had any issues and the tests pass on Linux (well, they timeout, but for a different reason - they at least do some testing)
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.import]"  nsresult: "0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: delayedStartup :: line 1148"  data: no]

I think I know what was going on. I built Firefox as XUL application. This build don't have a gre/modules/ at the firefox/ directory.
gre != firefox if you build firefox with --with-libxul-sdk=<dir>.
My mistake. This was fixed in bug 527784 but then I had backed out NetworkPrioritizer and didn't check it back in the right way.
Pushed http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/rev/63e06953ec5d

Thanks for catching and patching that Alexey!
