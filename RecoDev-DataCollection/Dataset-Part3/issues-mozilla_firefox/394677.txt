Whenever i'm trying to bookmark any webpage or download any file firefox crashes. 

By downloading i mean "Left click / Ok" type downloading not "Right click / save target as" downloading. It does not crash when doing it via right click / save as.

It always happens when i try to bookmark any page though unfortunately (Bookmarks / Bookmark this page).

The error message left in the console is:

"/opt/mozilla/lib/firefox-2.0.0.6/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:   903 Segmentation fault      "$prog" ${1+"$@"}"

903 = PID so that changes on every session.

Distro is Arch Linux. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmarks
2. Bookmark this page
3. Crash
Actual Results:  
Crashed with error:

"/opt/mozilla/lib/firefox-2.0.0.6/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:   903 Segmentation fault      "$prog" ${1+"$@"}"

Expected Results:  
Save the webpage to bookmarks

Bug occurs on a fresh install of firefox without any plugins / add-ons / profile / bookmarks / etc. Just basic fresh firefox install.

It was an Xfce theme that was causing it....
