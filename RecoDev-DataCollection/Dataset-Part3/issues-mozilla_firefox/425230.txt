we don't have a transaction there and we are potentially doing a bunch of changes. Adding one should not hurt anyone and could help shutdown when working on a network.

asking blocking, it's an easy and low risk change that could help on-network profiles shutdown
not blocking, we're really late, but if a safe patch is ready, we'll take this.
cleanupOnQuit has already atomic transactions for every op. so let's add only to clearHistory

well this will help less than hoped since really we already have single transactions on cleanUpOnQuit.
Still should speed up clear history and those users that clear history on quit, since it's a real minor and riskless change we can take it.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
