This doesn't occur for me.

Is that a distribution build you're using? The official Nightly builds are available here:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/

Does this reproduce in Safe mode?
https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode
Noticed this behaviour on mozilla.org nightly trunk on linux and mac osx.

Testcase:
1. Add couple of pinned apps 
2. Upgrade nightly from the latest build
3. When Firefox restarts after the upgrade. The pinned apps will be all gone. 

Can you reproduce that ?
No, this works for me. used three app tabs in the process.

Do you have any add-ons installed? Could you try disabling them and trying to reproduce again?
arky, any updates? does this work for you now?
Thx, It works now.
