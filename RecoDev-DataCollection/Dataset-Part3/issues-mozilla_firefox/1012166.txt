The light theme uses SVG, while the dark theme uses PNG images. It'd be nice to stay consistent. I'd say SVG is the best bet since it scales well at all levels.

This seems like a nice to have change that can easily ride the trains rather than being uplifted. Unless these icons first landed in 31, I don't see a real value in taking the change at this point. Please do renom if you feel strongly that this change should be included in 31.
