Accessibility focus is now on the top level window, instead of the document.
Actually, it's not just accessibility focus. Focus in general is broken.

I can tell this because when even a single page is loaded with this pref set, arrows won't scroll (obvious using a long enough, scrollable page to test).
This confuses screen readers as well as messes up regular keyboard users.

I suspect it's a simple thing to fix. Something like: instead of focusing windows, focus documents.

It's indeed a one-line fix. Nice catch, Aaron.

This is a simple fix which affects both screen reader access and regular keyboard access after launch.
