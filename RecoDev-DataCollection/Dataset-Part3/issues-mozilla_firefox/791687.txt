All build machines should be upgraded to use NSIS 2.46 now.  This bug is to remove the NSIS 2.33 related code which we no longer need to support.

Patch v1

There may be some other stuff that I don't know about. I grepped for "2.33" but from that I think this is the only thing that should be removed.
CC'ing aki and catlee for confirmation that we don't use NSIS 2.33 at all anymore.
Afaik, the last remaining NSIS 2.33 jobs were the win32 l10n repacks, which are now using 2.46.
I guess we can land (once reviewed) and see if anyone screams :)
I'm fine with that... it can always be backed out.

The same should be true for the !ifndef CallArtificialFunction block. r=me with that... if there are more we can get them later

Patch v2

Rebased so it can land directly on m-c with no dependencies. Removed the extra block that rstrong mentioned.

Pushed to try and if that goes well I'll land on m-i.
Carrying forward r+.

Patch v2

I'm going to do a rollup patch for the involved bugs for defaults handling on Windows 8 and ask for approval all at once in bug 791019.  If that lands on aurora and beta I'll update the tracking fields in this bug and post the changesets in this bug as well.
