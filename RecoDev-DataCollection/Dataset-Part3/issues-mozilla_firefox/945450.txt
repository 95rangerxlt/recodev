Some content of the browser window seems to not be selectable via the Browser Toolbox.  

For example, I don't see the "regular" Dev Tools themselves when the toolbox is visible on a browser window with web content.

There seem to sometimes be issues digging into <iframe> / <browser> boundaries, but I haven't yet figured out the pattern.
Maybe related to bug 922823 ?
The DevTools iframe now appears in the Browser Toolbox, likely because of bug 920141 or related work being fixed.
