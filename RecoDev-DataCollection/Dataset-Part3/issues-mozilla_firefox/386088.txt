A drop indicator appears while dragging inside a livemark container (between the folder and its children), making the user think that dropping is acceptable there.. but when a drop is made, the dropped item appears instead outside of the livemark container within the parent folder.

Change to: no drop indicator appears at any point while hovering over an open/closed livemark container.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
