If you have the history sidebar open and the entries are shown by date folders like "Today" aren't recreated until you reopen the Library. See the screencast: http://screencast.com/t/b7qAbnwWI.

Steps:
1. Start a profile with older history visits
2. Open the sidebar and remove the today folder
3. Expand a folder like "This Month" and open any web page

After step 3 the opened web page is added to "This Month". There is no "Today" folder created. You have to close and reopen the history sidebar to get the "Today" folder.

Comparing it to Firefox 3.0.x it is a regression. Will try to find the regression range.

so, i think this is because This month is open, and those containers are overlapped, so when we receive the new visit notification since a container has already accepted the visit we don't refresh the query.
This is new to this version because previously we did not have overlapped containers.
a simple fix would be to check if the new visit is < last 31 days, and always refresh in such a case even if a container has accepted the visit.
Won't it happen too when you have e.g. a folder from the last year only? Then we should create the folders for Today and This Month.
that happens only if an open container accept the visit, so the bug is only valid for overlapped containers.
FYI: This also happens with all containers collapsed.

only need to do this if the node is expanded right?

conceptually if root node is not expanded we should not even be notified, but better being defensive.
