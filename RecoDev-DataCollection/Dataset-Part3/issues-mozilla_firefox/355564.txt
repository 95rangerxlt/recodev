hi varun,
We are making a big push to try and get as many extensions as possible working for the upcoming release of  Firefox 2 in a few weeks.  Do you know if this extension will be compatible and ready to work with Firefox 2?

I'd like to think so. As a matter of fact, I did not get time so far to work on this and as of now i don't even know why this is not working. but i'm sure after a little modification i should be able to get it to work hopefully. please allow me some time.

Thanks.
