This test will need to be adapted so that it handles child process tabs.

The test navigates around in a child document and expects to retrieve focus information in the parent. It will need to ask the child for this information and be rewritten to work to wait for focus events to occur.

This version doesn't use any cpows. I ran this patch and the earlier one 19 times and this one didn't fail and the other one failed twice.
