Windows patch (checked in)

I'm not going to do the Mac OS X or Linux patches at this time but I'd like to get the Windows one in.
Nomin for security reasons
If someone more familiar with OS integration on Mac OS X and Linux would create patches for them I'd be a happy camper.

Windows patch checked in to trunk.

patch for Mac OS X

I discussed this change with Josh and since we already don't register as the default gopher handler on Mac OS X there should be no additional cleanup needed.

caillon, is there any additional cleanup needed if the application was set as the default gopher handler?

wow. this is a great idea. remove attack vectors by removing protocols. So did mozilla with thunderbird: they just "removed" smtp from mozilla. No thunderbird --> no --> smtp --> no attack vectors. I hope that the next logical step is to remove http. No http --> no people coming up with that stupid ideas. An yeah: Big thanks to the endless efforts of Jan Ruzicka for fixing the gopher protocol for for Firefox 2.0 just to seeing it removed from the browser right now.
I disagree on removal. I run gopher servers daily and mozilla firefox/mozilla is only browser that is wide spread and supports it. Please dont make the wrong move.
Other wise i will have to recommend users who visit my site to use lynx or "my gcc4 fixed" version of Mosaic which i dont see so safe. Besides gopher is a fast and good protocol

I'm starting to wonder if you guys have gone completely insane.
You're talking about the kind of decisions marketing and engineering specialists make in Microsoft or Apple headquarters...

Removing an integration feature in order to remove an attack vector?
This must be a joke..
Especially considering the bug is in Safari for Windows, not Firefox :/
Especially since the vast vast majority of users never even use gopher... meh
