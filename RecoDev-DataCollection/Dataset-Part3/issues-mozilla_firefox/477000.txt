patch rev1

Hey Jim, we don't use these two registry key values for anything and the one for 'Program Folder Path' is being incorrectly anyways... I'd like to get rid of them. Thanks

patch rev1

Drivers, I'd like to get this for Firefox 3.1. This patch removes code that sets a couple of registry keys we don't use and one of the keys is written incorrectly.

To verify this run the installer and check that the following registry keys don't exist where
${BrandFullNameInternal} = Minefield or Shiretoko
${AppVersion} = the version of the app e.g. 3.1b3pre or 3.2a1pre
${AB_CD} = the locale e.g. en-US

Path = Software\Mozilla\${BrandFullNameInternal}\${AppVersion} (${AB_CD})\Main"
Value name = "Program Folder Path"
 
Path = "Software\Mozilla\${BrandFullNameInternal}\${AppVersion} (${AB_CD})\Uninstall"
Value name = "Uninstall Log Folder"
