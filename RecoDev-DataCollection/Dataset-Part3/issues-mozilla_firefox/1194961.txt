We set a border-radius for Windows XP, Vista and 7 here:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/2ddfc9180971/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#l1238

And then we override that most of the time here:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/2ddfc9180971/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#l1247

We should remove the first rule.
