regression of bug 237535

"prelit" text is invisible (i.e. text on buttons and other UI elements which are
"prelit" by the presence of the mouse of other user activity) when inverse
themes are selected. 

To reproduce:
on GNOME, select the HighContrastInverse theme from "Desktop Preferences->Theme".
Start mozilla

Note that if the mouse is moved over UI buttons ("Back', 'Reload', etc. and
'Home', 'Bookmarks', etc. in the personal toolbar), the text on these elements
is invisible since it's displayed on white text on a white background.

Reproducible: Always

Please don't preprocess these (remove the *).  We're trying not to preprocess
css files if possible because of the risk of it stripping out id selectors...
and in this case you can simply remove the #ifdefs since this is gtk2 only.

Looks good other than that.

-button:hover:active,
+button[buttondown="true"],

this change should not be there.

I updated it on bug 248578.

should add
+button:hover:active[disabled="true"] {
+  color: GrayText;
+}

Need I repost it?

Nope, that's fine.  Whoever commits this should also commit to the aviary branch
as well, since that'll need the fix too for Firefox 1.0
checked in on aviary branch, but this won't apply cleanly to trunk.  Getting all
sorts of fun errors.

Ginn, can you provide a single diff (using -N to include the added files and
addressing the review comments) and I'll check this in tomorrow?  Sorry about
the delay on this, work has been unreal.
I think you just missed one file,
mozilla/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css.

It should be committed. The patch posted is OK for this file.

I guess I can't do diff -N, because I've on write permisson.

Thank you, Mike.
the lines removed from that file in the patch no longer exist on aviary or
trunk, as far as I can tell.  Please try building from CVS to verify this is
actually fixed and then resolve it please :)

land winstripe on trunk

2.I don't know where your gnomestripe/button.css gnomestripe/toolbarbutton.css
come from, they're not my version.
Maybe your mail client played tricks.

For example, in your file, there are
button {
  -moz-appearance: button;
  -moz-user-focus: ignore;
  margin: 6px;
  min-width: 6.3em;
  -moz-appearance: button;
 padding: 0px 4px;
  color: #000000;             //Hardcode color, should be ButtonText
}

There are so many differs.
All fun errors come from them.

I repost these 3 files here, please correct them ASAP.

Mike, I think you messed pinstripe and winstripe.
Oops, really fallible.

ugh, that's very possible.  Will fix this ASAP.
/me bangs head on table.  I knew I'd screw up one checkin out of the 13 or 14 I
did last night. :)
oh, and the updated fixes were checked in, please verify since I haven't exactly
had enough sleep to self-verify ;)
Fixed, thanks, Mike.
