Steps to reproduce:

I added width calc((100% - 3m) / 2) to a class


Actual results:

The width was set properly in the screen but in devtools the second opening parenthesis turned into undefined


Expected results:

the second opening parenthesis inside calc should have stayed as an opening parenthesis.

See demo at: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EzvBt.  I'm seeing this in nightly as well
Confirmed, latest Nightly (2014-10-09). 
As soon as you have grouping parenthesis. Value is applied correctly though.

This fixes the problem and seems simple enough, looks good as long as this try push turns up green: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c7eb8a5329ef.  Please update the commit message to include r=bgrins at the end
This is a better test push (there were unrelated failures in the first): https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=3d9866ac9e99

Do I need to create a patch with updated commit message even when setting checkin-needed? For instance in bug 982153, RyanVM seems to have corrected the message at check-in time instead.

If you're attaching a new patch anyway, it's nice to add the "r=" to it. But I wouldn't tell you to go out of your way to attach a new patch just for that. As long as your commit message meets the guidelines below, adding an r= when landing isn't a big deal :)
