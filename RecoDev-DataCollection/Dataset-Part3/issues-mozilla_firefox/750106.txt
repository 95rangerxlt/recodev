Bug 685059 may fix this.
I don't think we can simply remove the generic (globe) icon for in-content pages. Doing so would remove the ability to drag the icon to create bookmarks or open in a new tab. However, we could use a different icon for chrome URLs.

I agree, but this disagrees with https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=685059#c24 (that on the other side was posted before all of the identity box redesign), may you figure out with Stephen what's the final plan?
That bug is for the tab bar. We talked about removing the site identity block for chrome URLs at the work week but decided against it for the reasons mentioned in comment #2.
(In reply to Jared Wein [:jaws] from comment #4)
> That bug is for the tab bar.

whoops, my fault. thanks.
Maybe we could use a Home icon for this?
Or a gear icon, this matches most "about:*"s. Esp. interesting when in-content prefs land. 

However, some pages could use even another icon, e. g. the suggested home icon (only) for about:newtab and about:home.
Could also use a yellow /!\ icon for network error pages, and bring back the red/white "do not enter" icon for the malware/phishing blocking page.
You can see what it should look like on this mockup : icon + Firefox (in orange) | about:*

http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/customizationMode-liveDemo-i02/windows7-customizationMode-i02.html
Great work! :)

How will this affect special pages like about:neterror and the phishing warning (I see these pages have been removed, at least from about:about)? They should (IMO) get special icons (not Favicons!), e. g. the yellow warning triangle resp. stop sign – showing the same as mocked up in Comment 9 may confuse users.
Stephen, I see http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/customizationMode-liveDemo-i02/images-win7/identityBlock-firefox.png. Do you have a HiDPI version?

This shouldn't be too hard to implement once we get that other icon and maybe hover/active states if necessary.

FWIW, I don't think hover/active states here are necessary, since I don't know what we would show if the user clicked on it, unless we wanted the states for drag/drop purposes.
A "secure" panel may be useful (like Chrome).

Of course this will only be in use for in-content pages like customize, add-ons or preferences and library in the future. Phishing and neterror will keep their special favicon.

> Phishing and neterror will keep their special favicon.

Favicons can be spoofed (for this reason separate HTTPS icons were introduced) and may be used to trick users into clicking buttons to initiate an attack (or input credentials) while they believe they are on a Firefox error page. Thus, those pages should get their own icons (+ text) though not the "Firefox" one. 

Shall I file a follow up bug or do you consider implementing those in this Bug, too?

The icon in the address bar cannot be changed by a webpage.
But Favicons can, which Guillaume was talking about. Plus, in the current Beta at least, those icons are only used as Favicons, not "identity" icons in the Adress Bar.

We could show a larry like panel: http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/bugs/bug750106-firefoxPanel.png

This patch makes use of the new icon and gets it looking all spiffy, but doesn't include the identity panel doorhanger.
Also, no reason we can't land this on m-i instead of ux. Stephen, should this wait for Australis or go out in 24?

This patch implements the identity panel bits. I copied mozicon128.png to the content so that we would have an equivalent HiDPI graphic for each of the branding outputs.

It seems to me like this icon should be in the branding directory as it's pretty close to the trademarked logo. Then we would need another version for unofficial branding or use the generic version. I wouldn't hurt to get superreview on branding-related changes so I'm flagging Gavin.

Copying the images in HG feels dirty to me as I dislike forks. Moving them to /content/ or copying them at build time seems like less of a maintenance issue.

Why is this stuff split across two rules?

That's a good idea. Stephen, can create a HiDPI version of the graphics with all three states for consistency with Linux/Windows?

Also would be cool if we had nightly/aurora/(and shriek, unofficial!) versions too. But for unofficial I don't see a problem with continuing to use the unknownIdentity globe that we currently use.

This looks sane, but withholding an r+ until we hear more about branding rules.

I also think there are sections that could be put into browser/themes/shared, since they seem common.

Seems like this rule could go into ../shared. Same with the one in windows/browser.css. linux/browser.css has something similar too - but with an added background-color that we can just override with.

I would prefer to do that in a follow-up if possible.

This patch updates the icons to be used, moved them to branding, split out the CSS to a shared file, and includes a kitten.

Comment on attachment 765198
Patch v2.1

I filed bug 888563 to track updating the images for unofficial, Nightly, and Aurora. I changed the unofficial branding to use the globe instead of the Firefox icon so it can remain generic. This should drop the need for s-r since it won't introduce any branding issues.

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/3c5133764596
Shouldn't this be also displayed on new tab or will it be too distracting for the user ?

FWIW, the unofficial branding package is currently unused, so this did introduce branding issues for Nightly/Aurora. We'll probably fix that as part of bug 840883, though.
This is already on m-c, so not tracking for Australis.
