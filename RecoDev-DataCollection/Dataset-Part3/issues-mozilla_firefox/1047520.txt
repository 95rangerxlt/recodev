And yet, I can enable it in the options panel, hit reload, and then the browser is broken.

Unlikely to work at least until bug 985109 is fixed.
Would be nice to make it so it can't be enabled in the browser toolbox in the meantime. I think we can do this with the targetSupported stuff in the framework, but I've never really been that familiar with that part of our code base.

Disable the Canvas Debugger in the Browser Toolbox

Disabling the Canvas Debugger is easy. I don't know what prevents it from working in chrome code, so is there another bug for that, or shall we leave this one open?
