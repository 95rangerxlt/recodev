Some investigation:
  Call stack:
    nsINode::GetParentNode()
    nsContentUtils::ContentIsDescendantOf()
    PresShell::HandleEvent()
  Issue place:
    pointerEvent->retargetedByPointerCapture =
      frame && frame->GetContent() &&
      !nsContentUtils::ContentIsDescendantOf(frame->GetContent(), pointerCapturingContent);
Looks like frame became wrong in this place.
Possibly it happened at:
  while(CheckPointerCaptureState(pointerEvent->pointerId));

rs+, assuming this test crashes without the patch, and doesn't with the patch.

You could be consistent with { usage.
like, always function foobar() { and not
function barfoo()
