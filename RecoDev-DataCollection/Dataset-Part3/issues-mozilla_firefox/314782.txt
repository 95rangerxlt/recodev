The links to open the attachments appear briefly and then are covered up by the "Reply Forward" window appearing at the bottom of a GMail email. 

Other FireFox Notes:
Only an issue in GMail "Standard" mode. Works in "Basic HTML" mode.
The links appear if I forward the email to someone.
The links appear when reviewing an email already forwarded to someone.

IE Notes:
Works properly in IE 6 in both "Standard" and "Basic HTML" modes.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any read or unread email in GMail which has attachments.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Unable to click on a link to open the attachment.

Expected Results:  
Should be able to view the links to open the attachments.

I can provide screen snapshots if they are useful. It worked fine until I installed 1.5 beta. Still an issue with RC 1.

I get this too in Gmail but not consistently. Occasionally the flash of the content then disappearance occurs on other pages as well (digg.com, Cnet.com). This is a pretty big problem as the enite page may become invisible or the attachment of an E-mail (the whole point of it) may be gone.

Since this can stop all borwsing of a page or the reading of the attachment in mail (pretty basic) I feel that the severity should be increased to major. I had the same situation as the other poster - "It worked fine until I
installed 1.5 beta. Still an issue with RC 1." Thanks
Just checked and the problem still occurs (almost always with a Gmail message with an attachment and no reply) in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20051104 Firefox/1.6a1. I'm running:

While I can repeat the problem on various XP machines, it does not appear to be a problem on the Windows 2000 SP4 machines I have checked.
By switching to "No Page Style", I am able to see the page in a very basic way but not what I'd expect.
This also occurs at Digg.com quite often. I have had the same problem now using Ubuntu Linux.
I am no longer experiencing this problem with Gecko/20051111.
