When viewing a web page with an embedded Windows Media Player file, and the File page is closed other then through close tab, or close Firefox(the x), or sometimes even refreshed the following is displayed:

"
Windows Media Player Plug-In Dynamic Link Library

The plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox
[] Don't show this message again during this session.
"
I can reproduce this about 75% of the time.
After this bug Firefox becomes uslessly slow, and often uses 100% of prossesor power.

When you close Firefox completly it leaves a phantom Firefox running preventing running again unless you either terminate the phantom Firefox, or restart the computer.(see attatched screenshots)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install the Extention: All-In-One guestures at http://perso.orange.fr/marc.boullet/ext/extensions-en.html
or through Mozilla Update
2.Go to http://www.imagevine.com/l-videoclips-top.aspx
3.Open a video by clicking on View
4.Close it via the extention(hold right-click in the space below the video and draw an L)

Actual Results:  
Displays:
"
Windows Media Player Plug-In Dynamic Link Library

The plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox
[] Don't show this message again during this session.
"
And in near hang conditions

Expected Results:  
Properly terminated Windows Media Player

I would classify this as an extention problem, but I have experianced this, to a lesser degree, by reloading. Very irritating Bug.

Simple Batch file to terminate and restart Firefox incase of problem.

If you run this batch file in Xp it will terminate Firefox forcefuly and restart it, perhaps the "Firefox is already running" prompt could be replaced with something simalar to this.
I see this bug in the 2006-08-26 nightly branch build. After loading the video at the link presented below, and subsequently clicking the [X} in Firefox to close it, I note that the browser doesn't fully shut down (I have to kill it manually).

The video at the following page is what caused it for me:

I also do not have the All-In-One Gestures extension, so this appears to be unrelated to that.
This happens to me too on cnn.com
I'm on Windows 2003 Server Enterprise Ed (Ver 5.2 Build 3790 SP1)

Video plays ok on the popup window. but when it is closed:
1. FF stops responding.
2. menu bar can be clicked, but the selection under the menu is not highlighted on mouse over
3. memory utilization runs quite high (70MB and higher with about 5 tabs open)
4. sometimes exit can be clicked on the File menu. Sometime it closes sometime not, but the Process still exists


Seems Fixed to me
