possible patch

I'm trying to enable the crashreporter for xulrunner and firefox in distribution packages.
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/application.ini#61

I'm wondering how 
#if MOZILLA_OFFICIAL
can work anywhere if substitution is done through Preprocessor.py (interestingly I cannot find the substitution of application.ini anywhere in the log so just guessing it's done from Preprocessor.py).

You just need to export MOZILLA_OFFICIAL=1 in your mozconfig (or environment):
http://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/file/tip/mozilla2/linux/mozilla-central/nightly/mozconfig#l19
and configure will set it:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/configure.in#7980
and the Makefile where application.ini gets preprocessed sticks it in defines:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/Makefile.in#226
Hmm, doesn't work here.
I have MOZILLA_OFFICIAL set in my environment and it's also set in config/autoconf.mk correctly. Still application.ini doesn't get the Enabled flag.
As said I'm missing to find the preprocessor run in the build log for whatever reason and so cannot confirm if the flag is added correctly (this is really weird since I usually can see every action in the build log).
Grepping the build log also doesn't show any usage of -DMOZILLA_OFFICIAL.
Now I moved this 

ifdef MOZILLA_OFFICIAL
DEFINES += -DMOZILLA_OFFICIAL
endif

up in the Makefile and now it works correctly.
So something is fishy I guess.
It gets built in browser/app:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/Makefile.in#65
DIST_FILES get preprocessed:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/config/rules.mk#1908
That DEFINES addition is too late for sure in the Makefile.
Just confirmed that it's missing from the preprocessor run where it lives now.
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/browser/app/Makefile.in#84

Here rules.mk gets loaded. Placing the addition DEFINE in front of that fixes my issue.
Ah. You're partially right. The problem here is that the addition to DEFINES happens on the other side of that ifdef, so it doesn't get set when building --with-libxul-sdk. It doesn't matter if you set the variable before or after rules.mk is included, but here it's not being set at all.

Moves out the DEFINES from the wrong ifdef.
Not sure if I got everything what should live outside in any case.

Maybe not, but this should be fine.
