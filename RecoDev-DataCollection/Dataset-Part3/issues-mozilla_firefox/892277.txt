When paused in the debugger, pressing F8 or Cmd/Ctrl+/ should resume the debugger.
F8 is currently occupied by stepIn/stepOut so those need to be changed first.
Ok, since the four step controlling bugs are closely related and trying to break them into separate patches causes the others to bitrot, I'm combining them into one bug.

This patch changes the following hotkeys:

* resume - F8 and accel+/
* step over - F10 and accel+'
* step in - F11 and accel+;
* step out - shift+F11 and shift+accel+;

r+ with following change:

You need to rename the existing localization entities or else it won't update or something. Is insane. So "debuggerUI.stepping.resume" -> "debuggerUI.steppingKeys.resume", or whatever but for all of the pre-existing entities.
