In bug 992911 there is work to run each directory standalone, which in this case yields a failure.

try server push is here:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=07d9eef3e4f0

here is the direct log for linux64 bc3 opt:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=38311655&tree=Try

could it be we are waiting on focus and not getting it?

:billm, do you have any theories on this?  Do you need any further information that I could gather to help fix this?

wait-for-focus

I have no idea if this fixes the problem. But looking at the code, it seems like we're calling waitForFocus in a tab where we expect about:blank to be loaded. So it seems like we need to pass true for expectBlankPage.

I copied this code from here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/tests/browser/browser_bug295977_autoscroll_overflow.js#122
So if this patch is right, then we should fix that test as well.
Looks like bug 943567 covers the other test you linked to.

But I'm not sure why these tests need to call waitForFocus. They should probably be instead using registerCleanupFunction to clean up, as, for example, the test browser_save_resend_postdata.js does.
All this code was changed here by bug 999604, so my idea is no longer valid.
this doesn't seem to be a problem anymore:

I'm going to guess that bug 805068 is what fixed this, but meh.
