v.1.5 is planned for ff3 release, and compatibility with 3 is planned. Will update as more info becomes available.
be good to get the update before beta4 or rc1 if possible.
updated today! woot.
looks like this is at 3.0.*

Kev,  do you have contacts that you can check with about 3.1 compatibility?

3.1b2 is the current beta in testing.

beta3 is planned in Jan., and RCs will be starting in Feb.   It would be great to get this one updated soon.
I'll talk to eBay about release schedule. I know dev is in-progress, but I don't have a release date.
Version 1.6.9 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/5202#version-1.6.9) got "Minor tweak for Firefox 3.1 compatibility". However, since there is no more Firefox 3.1 version planned we could:
a) close this bug (FIXED) referring to Firefox 3.0.x compatibility;
b) keep the bug open (REOPENED) with a bug title change: "Firefox Companion for eBay addon not available/working for Firefox 3.5".
They've already been contacted about Fx 3.1b3 compatibility. Please open a new bug if you feel it's necessary.
I've contacted them separately as well. Not convinced a new bug is required until we get closer to the beta release of 3.5b4, but that's just a personal opinion.
Makes sense. DRol contacted them as well. I also contacted many other add-ons that are on the recommended lists that have not upgraded to Fx 3.1b3.
they updated to 3.1b2, but now need to get on the 3.5 train.
"Firefox 3.0 - 4.0b6" now; resolving.
