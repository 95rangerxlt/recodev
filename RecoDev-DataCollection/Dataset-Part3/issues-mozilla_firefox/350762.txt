bug 348698 patch 235967 inadvertently added 5px (?) right padding between close button and end of tab.

looks like perhaps it did the same for spacing between start of tab and the tab's favicon.

Reproducible: Always

I don't see any difference between the tab close buttons in a build with that patch and a build without. This might be due to another bug.
Ignore initial description above.

Too much space between beginning of tab and the tab's icon.
Too much space between tab close button [X] and end of tab.
IMHO

Not caused by bug 348698 after all.

Is this being seen in the latest branch nightly? Your build identifier is saying you're seeing this in a trunk nightly.

This is a regression between 1.8.1b2_2006082922 and 1.8.1b2_2006083013 so I think bug 347482 might have caused this.

what we need to do is match top padding with start/end padding, just to balance that
as pointed out by ria, this is because of a change I made.  

the tab edge images are now 2px wider (8 to 10 px), and I failed to notice this side effect.

should be simple to fix, I'll fix the css and the images and attach a patch.

mconnor is also right, I need to twiddle the padding, too
the fix was to revert the css to have the tab left / right image widths at 8px (instead of 10px) and to fix the images.

I've just landed the fix.

see bug #350139 for the patch.
