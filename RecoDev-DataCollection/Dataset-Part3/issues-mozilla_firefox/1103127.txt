Here is a graph server outline showing the regression;
http://graphs.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=%5B%5B293,53,33%5D,%5B293,53,35%5D%5D&sel=1415996995821,1416601795821&displayrange=7&datatype=running

It appears the subtest is:
iconFade-close-DPI2.error.TART

Here is the pushlog on tbpl:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Beta&jobname=Ubuntu%20HW%2012.04%20mozilla-beta%20pgo%20talos%20svgr

and here is the offending changeset:
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/pushloghtml?changeset=0bcee2fc8e0b

There were a handful of changesets and bugs in this push, I am not sure what the root cause is, but I wanted to get this filed asap

What is the user-visible effect of this kind of regression?

Vladan, can you find somebody to help out with diagnosis here? In order to do anything about this we have to have low-risk patches landed by Monday afternoon.
oh, and tsvgx appears to have a 6% regression:
http://graphs.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=%5B%5B281,53,33%5D%5D&sel=none&displayrange=7&datatype=running

appears to be in:

This might have been bug 1101122 adding a panel to browser.xul that isn't hidden by default. I can make a very low risk patch to fix that but I don't have a linux environment suitable for testing. Who could verify this?
Created attachment 8526985
possible fix
We would have to do PGO builds for this.  It could be done on try, we just need to have:

Make sure this is from the mozilla-beta tree.

Good catch. I wish our layout code would be a little more intelligent :/ I'm quite confident the patch will fix it and it's the same I ran into with bug 1077652.
Looks like the patch fixes the regression but we're going to roll it into some changes in bug 1101122
thanks for putting this together so fast!
oh, this regression set seems much more involved and across the board:

Great, I see the fix for this landed:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Beta&rev=65fa22861cad

I did a bunch of retriggers and we will see if the automation scripts detect improvements :)
all the regressions seemed to be back to normal, thanks for jumping on this!
