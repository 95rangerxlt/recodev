On Windows 7, we display a fog behind the tabstrip to make it easier to read the tab labels over the glass. That fog is actually a box-shadow with blur, and is semi-opaque to give it a foggy effect. Think frosted-glass.

According to mattwoodrow, putting the opacity directly on the element (the TabsToolbar::before pseudoelement to be exact), results in us taking a slow-path in layout land. It's much faster if we move the opacity value into the alpha channel of the colour we set the box-shadow.

This should result in a super-easy win for TART, according to mattwoodrow.

Landed in UX as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/8b514254b168
As discussed with Mike on irc, there's still somewhere else in the UI that is doing this, though it gets invalidated much less often.

I filed bug 939607 for handling this efficiently within layout.
