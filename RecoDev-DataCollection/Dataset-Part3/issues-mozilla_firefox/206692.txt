Since this is mostly about changing makefiles, I think you should contact bryner.

updated patch to fix autocomplete in thunderbird

Thunderbird currently doesn't use the new toolkit's autocomplete. So I added an
ifdef MOZ_THUNDERBIRD to xul.css to bind autocomplete to the old autocomplete
binding.
Everything in this patch has been checked in except for the following change to
allmakefiles.sh. Firebird seems to build console and components just fine
without this patch. But I'm not sure I see how the Makefile's get generated for
these two directories in firebird without my change. Holding off to make sure I
really need this...

I've just built Thunderbird from the trunk, without the patch in comment 4, so
perhaps it's not needed.

Everything seems to be working perfectly (nice to have an addressbook button now
too), including toolbar customisation, which wasn't before.
should this be marked Fixed ?
The remaining bits were fixed by dbaron in bug 212509. Three years ago. Die, ghost bug, die!
