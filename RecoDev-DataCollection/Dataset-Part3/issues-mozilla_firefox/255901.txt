These yellow tooltips that appear on items inside the drop-down lists of the "Go
back one page", "Go forward one page" and the "Read Mail and News" buttons
appear under the mouse-pointer. So they vanish after a short time.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:  
They should correctly be displayed below the mouse-pointer like the other
tooltips, to avoid this problem.

Can you still see this bug?
These tooltips seem fine in Firefox RC2.
I cannot see the problem in 1.0 final anymore. So I close this bug.
