In browser/devtools/webide/webide-prefs.js:

> pref("devtools.webide.simulatorAddonRegExp", "fxos_(.*)_simulator@mozilla\.org$");

Trips a warning on a startup:

WARNING: preserving unexpected JS escape sequence: file modules/libpref/prefread.cpp, line 393

Assuming you want the parsed pref (and thus input to the regexp engine) to contain "\.", I think the prefs file should contain "\\."
