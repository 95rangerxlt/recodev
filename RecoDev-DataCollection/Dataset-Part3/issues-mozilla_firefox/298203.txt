makefile patch for BrowserDirectoryProvider
I learned in Bug 286494 that Windows uses the same variable so one needs to do
something like this

ifneq ($(OS_ARCH),WINNT)
SHORT_LIBNAME        = brwsrdir
endif

yeah, definitely need the WINNT stuff.

revised patch
Why does this need a shortname? Aren't the OS/2 release builds static builds?
I think Mike's release builds were non-static, but even if they were static we
should still keep non-static builds working on OS/2.
The are several things I don't understand here: a while back I thought mkaply
told me not to worry about long names any more: we use longnames (such as
extensions-startup.manifest) in the profile.

Furthermore, I don't think you (or I) should be worrying about non-static
configurations: I have been adding little dynamic components willy-nilly
trusting that in release configurations they will be merged into the static
binary, and your perf is going to suck if you are releasing dynamic builds.
Long filenames are not a problem on OS/2, _except_ for DLLs. If DLLs have more
than 8.3 chars they cannot be loaded and Firefox probably won't run, if the DLL
is dynamically linked at compile time.
I agree that static builds are the way to go for releases, even though they
don't seem to make much of a difference regarding performance. (I don't have
numbers to back this up at the moment, though.) But for debugging etc. we need
to keep the SHORT_LIBNAME stuff just to keep Firefox running.
Also, debug builds cannot be static on OS/2, so in order to debug, we have to
maintain the short names.
Fix checked in.
