Firefox tries to import IE bookmarks into Firefox.  This is fine, except that it
imports it over any old Firefox bookmarks you have.  I have since lost my bookmarks.

I've seen this once too. It's a serious bug, but I haven't tried to reproduce it.
Did the migration fail entirely or did it transfer all settings except the
bookmarks?

I just installed Firefox 0.9RC (upgrade from 0.8) on winXP

In addition to the bookmarks being overwritten: My cookie settings were not
transfered (ask before accepting). My 0.8 cookies where lost, it looks like they
might have been replaced with my IE cookies. My cookie sites were lost. My font
settings were lost.

It looks like my saved passwords were copied over. Search plugins and proxy
settings were preserved/migrated too. 
Confirming based on dupes
I'm sorry for not having time to test bug I *think* these are the steps to
reproduce:

1. Install Firefox on a new computer, don't launch it from the installer
2. Make sure you have an already existing profile on your hard drive (either
from a previous install or copied from elsewhere)
3. Start "firefox.exe -p" to show the profile manager
4. Create a "new" profile by pointing to the already existing profile (making
firefox aware of it) and then start Firefox

Actual results:
The already existing bookmarks gets replaced by the Internet Explorer favorites.

Expected results:
The bookmarks should have been preserved.

Again, sorry for not having time to test it, I'm just providing these steps
because this is what I did when it happened. Setting blocking0.9? flag.
I have the problem but not in the manner that D. Tenser explained it. I
installed from the installer and started FF after the installation (when
prompted). It automatically imported all the IE bookmarks and settings and I've
lost all my existing settings. For the record, IE is the default browser on the
PC (Win 98).  I have existing Mozilla, Phoenix, Fire Fox and Thunderbird profiles.
I uninstalled Firefox then reinstalled 0.8 and my bookmarks came back.
ugh.  I think I have an inkling of what would be causing this, but I'm not 100%
sure.  Still, we can't really ship with this.
You have not "lost" your bookmarks... 0.9 uses a different location to store
profile information. What's happening is that IE is somehow set as your default
browser so Firefox thinks it should import from that, not from the old (0.8)
profile location. 

I think the easiest way to fix this is to simply not "automigrate" from the
default browser, but ask where to get settings and info from. Unfortunate, but
necessary it seems. 
The migration failed completely.  History was gone too.

br and trunk fixed. 
Note, Ben, my comment about "creating" a new existing profile and start using
Firefox for the first time using that profile. Then it's not a case about having
two different locations for the profile of Phoenix/Firefox, but it's a true
dataloss issue. I'll try to reproduce this with your fixed version and file a
separate bug on that.
