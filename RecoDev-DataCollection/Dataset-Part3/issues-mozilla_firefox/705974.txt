Bug 670880 removed modules/SpatialNavigation.js in Fx8 for all platforms
Bug 504645 removed icons/document.png in Fx7 for Linux

Both are not removed when applying an update from earlier versions, eg 3.6.24, and this fixes that up.

Drivers, this patch removes two files when users apply an update, which we stopped shipping in Fx7 or 8 "installers". The result is an old install + updates will be the same as a new install (excluding old empty directories we don't remove with the updater).  Both files were minor ones that were unused or little used before we stopped shipping them in "installers".

I'd like to at least get this on Aurora, and beta if it's an appropriate change at this point in the cycle, but it's not a problem if that is not problem.
Ahem, .... it's not a problem that isn't possible.

[Triage Comment]
Let's let this ride the train. Doesn't appear to have major user benefit, and QA said this doesn't affect their testing.
Ok, all done here then.
