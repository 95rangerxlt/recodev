There's no reason for this to be imported unconditionally into the global scope at startup with getTargetFile being the only consumer.

Move away the loading of DownloadLastDir.jsm from the startup path.

Zero-risk Ts win, nominating to land on 1.9.1.2.
Do you have numbers for the Ts win? I doubt it's significant, so I don't think we should bother trying to get this on the branch.

No, it's not significant: <http://tinyurl.com/258pht> (sorry if the graph is not that useful; I didn't know how to generate a good graph link.)

not a significant enough win to take on the branch, I agree with gavin
DownloadLastDir.jsm is still loaded at startup (through nsHelperAppDlg.js), but I've just nixed it in bug 536503 which should land soon.
