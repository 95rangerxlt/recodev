Demonstration of problem

This was noticed using a recent build of UX after bug 865374. We probably shouldn't be drawing in the titlebar for these windows. See screenshot.

This seems to take care of the problem.

Dao, are there other variations I should care about besides chromehidden~="toolbar"?

What does this have to do with this bug?

Can't you use padding-top in both cases?

No, this should be sufficient as of bug 855370.

We need this rule: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/osx/global/toolbar.css#7

Otherwise the popup "toolbar" that contains the urlbar has a white background. Did you have an alternative suggestion?

Switched from height to padding.

write it like this instead:

#titlebar {
  padding-top: 9px;
}

#main-window[chromehidden~="toolbar"] > #titlebar {
  padding-top: 22px;
}

Has this fix started being built in the nightlies? I'm seeing broken popup titlebar behavior in the most recent (2013/7/8) build of the UX branch.

Yes, it should have been there two months ago. I suppose you should re-open bug 888022 then.
