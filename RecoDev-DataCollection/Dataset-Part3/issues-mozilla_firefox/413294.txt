Bug 404825 intentionally (after some debate, it seems) removed the folder icons from the bookmarks toolbar in Gnomestripe.  This causes a mix of icons and folders in the bookmarks toolbar to appear quite odd: the name of the folder runs in to the name of the icon for the previous item.  (The change introducing the dropdown arrows seems good to me, though.)

Steps to reproduce: Add some bookmarks and some folders to the bookmarks toolbar

Expected results: Visual appearance clearly distinguishing items, perhaps with additional user interface to indicate that more is available by clicking the folders.

Actual results: Folder preceded by non-folder is visually indistinct, and there is in general less clear a feeling that the toolbar contains a set of items.

Except that there is now no visual continuity in the gnomestripe theme.  Why do these dropdown markers look completely different that the ones for the forward and back buttons?
BTW.  userChrome.css code to revert this is:

.bookmark-item[container] > .toolbarbutton-menu-dropmarker {
  display: none !important;
}

.bookmark-item[container] > .toolbarbutton-icon {
  display: -moz-box !important;
}
Or, you could install my new Gnomestripe Folder Icons extension from http://www.wg9s.com/mozilla/firefox/extensions .
Ventnor: is there any reason you removed this? Linux parity? It's a pretty big change, and I'm not sure for the better in this case, since those things *are* bookmark folders.
I still like the change but feedback (bugzilla, irc, mozillazine forums) has generally been very negative, so it's probably the best to change it back before beta 3 if possible.
I think the folder and RSS icons should be restored. Linux is not Mac.
Jakub, that's strange to hear from you. I thought all you cared about was platform look and feel? The way it currently is is as native as it can be. ;)

Still, I agree that we should change back. Mostly because of livemarks (two different kinds of containers is something special in firefox) because I doubt anyone had considered this case.

Bring back icons, but keep the dropdown arrow.

Really wanted for beta 3 since we're leaning back to use of icons rather than over-simplification.

Well I'm not talking about "clutter" but the icon+arrow combo takes quite a lot of real estate in the bar. I thought the folder icon was intuitive enough to every Linux users as to what happens when they're clicked..
