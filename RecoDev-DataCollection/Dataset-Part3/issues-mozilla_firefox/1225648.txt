We currently are duplicating the logic of the skip-default-browser-dialog code across the nsWindowsShellService, nsGnomeShellService, and nsMacShellService. Moving this logic to nsBrowserGlue will remove the duplication.

Also, we were previously incrementing browser.shell.defaultBrowserCheckCount pref in the shell services as well as within nsBrowserGlue, though the one in nsBrowserGlue was more conservative as it only incremented if recovery wasn't activated and if the browser wasn't already set as default.

Nit: I don't think you need to touch this line, right?

This probably needs an idl rev.
Yeah I didn't need to touch that line. I made a change there while working on the patch then moved some code around again and didn't undo the change. Thanks for catching the IDL rev.
