I've commented in bug 830415 about this code, that we don't execute anymore since we switched to the JavaScript API for downloads. This shouldn't stop us from removing this currently unused code, anyways.

-  get visible()

-    // If we're still using the toolkit downloads manager, delegate the call
-    // to it. Otherwise, return true for now, until we decide on how we want
-    // to indicate that a new download has started if a browser window is

-    return DownloadsCommon.useToolkitUI ? this._toolkitUI.visible : true;
-  },
+  get visible() true,

The comment suggests that we don't always want to return true. Is that no longer the case?

Exactly, the return value is irrelevant now that we use the JavaScript API.
