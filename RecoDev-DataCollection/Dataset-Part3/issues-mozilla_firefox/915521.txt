v.1 Use padding with background-clip:content-box

Supposedly the gradient below is expensive and I never liked using a gradient for the solid background in the first place. According to the CSS 3 Background and Borders spec for background-color[1], "The background color is clipped according to the ‘background-clip’ value associated with the bottom-most background image." We can use this to avoid the gradient.

%define fgTabBackgroundMiddle linear-gradient(transparent 0px, transparent 2px, -moz-dialog 2px, -moz-dialog)

Compare talos on the WIP for Windows-only didn't show much change. Perhaps it will help non-Windows or there was a bug in the WIP.

Hrm. Yeah, I was expecting more of a win here.

For reference, here's the original try push that tested this:

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=71846875686c

And, specifically, here's the patch:

https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/71846875686c

Looking at my Try push, it looks like I applied that patch not on tip, but on the patch that first landed those curvy tabs. :/ So that at least explains the discrepancy.

Should this be @fgTabBackgroundColor@?

No, since this is for LWT. I don't think it will be visible unless the LWT has transparency.  This is the same value as prior to the patch.

Just chop out the TODO and split that comment over two lines, and you're good to land. Thanks Matt!
