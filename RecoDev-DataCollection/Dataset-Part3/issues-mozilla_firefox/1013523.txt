To be honest I don't know what this is doing but I see no change after removing this code.
This was meant to select the right category when undo closing an about:preferences tab. However, that seems currently broken.

Blair, do you know why this is here?

I didn't see ttaubert's comment until now.

Why are we removing this code? We should rather fix it.
Bug 1012368 was WONTFIXed to not remembering the last opened pane. This would also apply on reopening a tab.

Jared, what do you think?

Hypothetically, if this code was only present for the case of restoring a closed tab, should we still keep it? Is that a common enough use case to add it to the matrix of test cases?
I don't know. I can see it go either way - there might be people that expect that to work because it's a tab. OTOH maybe people don't even recognize it's a tab and just see it as "the prefs dialog" and don't even expect that to be restorable with undo close.
Verified on Windows 7 64bit, Ubutu 13.10 32bit and Mac OSX 10.8.5 and the following mentions should be done: 
 - for Firefox 32 Beta 4 (buildID: ), this bug is fixed: after reopening a tab, the last opened pane is not remembered; the General pane is displayed
                  - the name displayed in Location Bar is about:preferences (without #general, #privacy, etc.)
 - for Nightly 34.0a1 (buildID: ): after reopening a tab, the last opened pane is remembered  
                  - the name displayed in Location Bar is about:preferences#general/privacy/etc

Here is an inconsistency between latest Nightly 34.0a1 and Beta 32.0b4.

Is this intended behaviour? That this bug should be fixed only on Beta 32.0b4 and not fixed in latest Nightly 34.0a1 since the In-content Preferences feature is not shipped yet in Beta?
Firefox 32 Beta 4 (buildID: 20140804164216)
latest Nightly 34.0a1 (buildID: 20140806030201)
I think this is because Bug 754304, which is Target Milestone: Firefox 33, changes this behavior a bit.
