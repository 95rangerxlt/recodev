Bill and I noticed that AutoCompletePopup seems to leak its docshell, probably until we shut down the form fill controller (which is why it shows up with the ++DOCSHELL leak detector, but not the XPCOM leak detector).  That's kind of bad, though not as bad as a window leak.

Bill actually wrote the patch, but it is pretty trivial so I can deal with getting it landed and reviewed.

AutoCompletePopup should detach its docshell on unload.

try run looks fine.
