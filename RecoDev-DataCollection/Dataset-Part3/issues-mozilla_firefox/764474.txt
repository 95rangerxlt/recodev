The highlighter highlights other elements when we use the arrow keys.
But we don't stop the event.

If the web site uses the arrows keys to do "things", it's just a complete mess.
Use right/left with this website for example: http://www.tibco.com/
Or try to move the cursor in jsbin.com.

I think we should just not highlight other nodes when arrow keys are pressed.

We should only use the arrow keys when the breadcrumbs are focused.

Really into this patch, much better behavior now. I guess you could change that comment since it's a one-item list now, but not necessary at all. Awesome!
