Was working a few days ago on nightly. Not working since yesterday.

Currently running:
Name 	Firefox
Version 	44.0a1
Build ID 	20151013030225

It's working fine with Firefox stable.
What build do you have on the device?  Is it the same in each test?

Check the Build ID from Device Info -> More Info.
Tested on 
- a Orange Kliff on 2.0m
- a z3c on master (20151013)
- a flame on master (20151009)
Do you see any errors in the browser console[1]?

Oh sorry, I should have started with that. I have:

>TypeError: Cmds.takeScreenshot is not a function
>oncommand()
> webide.xul:1
> webide.xul:1:1
Hmm, I am not able to reproduce it here.

Do you still see this on today's desktop Nightly (2015-10-15)?

If you do, what about if you try a clean profile?
Arf, too bad. Yes, I reproduce on 2015-10-15 nightly (freshly downloaded), with a clean profile.

I also reproduce with 2015-10-16 nightly. 

I'm on Ubuntu 15.04.
I think I just realized what's happening.

I believe you're using the menu Runtime -> Screenshot, right?

Does it work if you use the Screenshot button at the bottom of the right-hand sidebar?

Yes I do (I've never realized there were another way).
