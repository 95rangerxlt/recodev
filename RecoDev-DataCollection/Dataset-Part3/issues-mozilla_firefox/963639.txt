only make Australis customization mode set customizing=true on toolbars which are customizable,

Seems to me this is all that needs to happen, right? I hope you don't mind that I'm stealing this, it's so low effort that I figured we should just take the fix already.

That's fine that you took it. I wasn't going to get to it this week. That's all I had in mind for the fix too so r=me. Of course a simple test would be nice but I'm not sure it's worth the effort at this point. I'll mark in-testsuite? so someone can come back and write a test.
