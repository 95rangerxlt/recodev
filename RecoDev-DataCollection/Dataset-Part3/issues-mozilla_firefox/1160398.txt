### Steps to reproduce:
1. Sign out of Pocket (if you're already signed in).
2. Click the Pocket button in your tool bar.
3. Click the "Learn More" link above the [Sign Up with Firefox] button.

### Actual results:
Note that a new tab is opened in the background, but the modal popup is still open, so if you accidentally click the Learn More button again, it keeps opening tabs.

### Expected results:
After clicking the Learn More link, the door hanger should automatically close.

Same with the ominous "(?)" button next to "Sign Up with Firefox" which currently takes you to: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
I believe this issue is fixed in the latest release.

The (?) is gone.
The URL is now https://getpocket.com/?s=hero&t=wlm&src=ff_learn_more
And the panel closes
