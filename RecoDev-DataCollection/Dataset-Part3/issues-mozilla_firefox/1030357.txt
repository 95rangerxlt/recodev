Just skips the tests for now, since they are failing on Holly.  Pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=ab1842664b62

Moving DevTools test bugs to e10s milestone M7 (i.e. not blocking e10s merge to Aurora).
Hi Brian. What's the status on this bug?

> Hi Brian. What's the status on this bug?

The project editor works fine within the Web IDE when e10s is enabled, but unfortunately the tests are trickier to update than I was hoping.

Basically, in all the tests right now we end up passing a CPOW iframe into the ProjectEditor constructor: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/projecteditor/test/head.js#117.  It seems this is causing issues with detecting the load event on that object.  To move this object into a frame script it seems like we would need to change all of this interfacing with the projecteditor object in the test suite to use some kind of message passing: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=path%3Abrowser%2Fdevtools%2Fprojecteditor%2Ftest+%22projecteditor.%22&redirect=true.

I hope I'm missing something obvious that would allow us to work around this, or at least to pass this object back and forth in with the frame script - but it's not JSON serializable (it has DOM nodes attached, for instance).
Maybe we could change this to load the projecteditor URL to load into a toolbox like Patrick is doing with many of the shared/ tests in Bug 1034512.

Oddly, this started working locally today when I ran it and try confirms: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=587048a4e34c

Review of attachment 8574174:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why these tests suddenly started working. Most likely this is due recent change to the platform.

Since everything looks ok on try, I see no reason not to land these.
