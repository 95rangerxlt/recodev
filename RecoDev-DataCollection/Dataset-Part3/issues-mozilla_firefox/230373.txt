Neither of these do that. Is this only related to Win32/Mac builds?
Just do a make -f client.mk checkout for Firebird and for *today*.

It seems that there is a new patch added. Don't know if it will kill this bug.
In answer to comment #1 : bug is also present in a linux based build (with
sources up to date at midnight - 8 january 2004, mozilla.org time)

I will try to build with latest checkin added at 02:18 by Brian Ryner and see if
xul error is still alive or not.
Patches added at 02:18 am fixes the xul error.

Closing bug as fixed :)
