This seems to occur only when browser.newtab.url is not about:newtab (I have it set to about:blank).
Now that you mention it, I did notice this stop working when I changed my browser.newtab.url to about:blank.
Ran mozregression with browser.newtab.url set to about:blank and it pointed to the change[0] in bug 936417. However, the actual regressing change[1] was in bug 799780.

Looks fine to me, but I prefer Gavin to look at it too.

Also, can you please write a test for this?  Thanks!

This is probably going to upset the other two people who want their newtab.url to be used for everything, but I guess they can file their own bug!

Part 1: Cleanup browser_privatebrowsing_urlbarfocus.js and remove unnecessary tests

The initial version of browser_privatebrowsing_urlbarfocus.js[0] starts off with a blank page and checks that the location bar isn't focused. It then switches to private browsing mode (which was global at the time) and checks that that the location bar is focused. Finally, it switches back to normal mode and checks that the location bar is no longer focused.

When per window PB was introduced, those steps were translated to match the new world order even though most of the steps became unnecessary. This patch removes everything except actually opening a new window and checking for focus.

I changed the patch to merely fix the focus issue.
That first patch actually seems preferable to me. It's not clear to me why about:privatebrowsing should override about:newtab but not custom newtab.url values.

I agree with Dao, I prefer the first patch.

I am upset by this change...
The reason is this: I use the PB mode quite often for regular browsing, and seeing about:privatebrowsing does not provide any useful/new information since I know the effects of PB. So I set browser.newtab.url to about:newtab# to be able to use the tiles (I had to add the # so that it is a user set value).
Should I seriously file a new bug when the patch is available here?
Another related suggestion that I made is bug 748530.
