The visual refresh seems to have forgotten about browser.tabs.disableBackgroundClose - set it to true and your nonselected tabs have a strange and terrible and off-center strip of lowered opacity running clear through them. If nobody figures out a way to fix it so the buttons look disabled, rather than looking like someone took a swipe at them with a paintbrush, we should just go for no change in appearance, and if it's written to survive not having a default value, think about taking it out of firefox.js so people aren't tempted to see our brokenness.

I don't understand how browser.tabs.disableBackgroundClose=true is different from browser.tabs.closeButtons=0. It looks different, sure, but to what end? imho browser.tabs.disableBackgroundClose can/should be removed.
I'd say the primary difference is that you're several thousand times more likely to inadvertently double-click a background tab in the area where the close button isn't yet, and accidentally close it, with closeButtons=0.

Remove it (trunk)

This should be a minimal removal - there's a little more related stuff in browser.css, but it's mingled with other stuff, and I'd rather take a new bug to strip it all out once the visual refresh lands on the trunk and the branch is gone. (Branch patch to come, because some unsynced whitespace at the end of a line on branch is confusing patch.)

we typically don't block on bugs with hidden prefs, and never this late.

would likely take the patch though.

Bah, last branch patch didn't actually remove the pref. I must have been too shocked by all that trailing whitespace.

You should also remove tab-close-button-placeholder entirely (i.e. xul.css, tabbrowser-tab binding in tabbrowser.xml and in globablBindings.xml of each theme, browser.css files of each toolkit theme).

Thanks for exposing browser.tabs.closeButtons while you're here.

Hmm, yeah. I don't know why removing something that's always display:none seemed like a scary change to me last night.

r=mano. On branch, you also need to tweak the winstripe-specific binding.
