remove addRows and endsWith

addRows http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.js#95 existed since before the Page Info code was ported from the suite, possibly added in bug 52370. As far as I can tell, it was never used.

endsWith http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/pageinfo/security.js#353 was added in bug 377076, and its caller was removed in bug 379239.

Removing these two functions reduces code size by about 400 bytes.
