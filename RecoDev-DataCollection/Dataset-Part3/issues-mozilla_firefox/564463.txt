Websites that utilize popup windows for further interactive functionality (such as phpbb's popup window to search for usernames) can severely slow performance of the web browser.

Popup windows can become unable to be closed easily, to the point of having to force close the window through the Operating System.

Even after forcing closure of the popup window, browser client then becomes unable to use any menu driven functions within Firefox. Right-click menu's, pull down menus, etc cease to become visible though the outline of the menu box will sometimes appear.

Other popup dialog windows generated by Firefox also become useless at this point as you are unable to see their contents.

Force Closure of Firefox and relaunching of the client is the only solution I've found so far.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a website the uses interactive popup windows as part of its interaction with the user.
2. Utilize the portions of the website that cause those popup windows to be generated.
3. Problem should become apparent, though it may be more readily encountered during longer browser sessions.
Actual Results:  
See details.

Expected Results:  
Browser should have continued operating normally.

Using default theme. Problem was also present in the previous Beta build, it is not nearly as pronounced as it was then.
