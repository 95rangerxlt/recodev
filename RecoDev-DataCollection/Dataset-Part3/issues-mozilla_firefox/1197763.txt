Both of these are about ctrlKey vs. metaKey. I believe they can be replaced by just:

event.getModifierState("Accel")

browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#ifndef XP_MACOSX
browser/components/search/content/search.xml:#endif

This can be converted to a simple JS handler that gets attached in the constructor of the binding, or can be made to no-op (ensuring the event still gets propagated and handled correctly elsewhere!) on OSX.

Finally, this file needs to have its "*" removed in jar.mn

Nit: brace on end of previous line.

Looking at the net results for this file, I don't think we need to do this, see below.

Nit: please re-wrap:

this.addEventListener("keypress", aEvent => {
  if (...)
    this.openSearch();
}, true);


tbh, considering this is the only use for this platform check in this file, the binding is only used for the search bar, and we don't need appconstants for anything else, I think you could just do:

navigator.platform.startsWith("Mac")

to check for OS X.
