Steps to reproduce:

On an up-to-date install of Arch Linux, mochitest fails to run because `testing/mozbase/mozinfo/mozinfo/mozinfo.py` is unable to detect the distribution, version and OS version.

To reproduce:

    $ ./mach mochitest


Actual results:

mochitest fails to parse the `skip-if` strings because `os_version` is bound to `StringVersion(" ")`. 


Expected results:

mochitest should run correctly.

platform.linux_distribution also came up recently in bug 1117543.

r+ with requested changes made. Since this is your first patch, please upload a new version and it should be a rubber stamp approval from me.

I'd feel better if these 2 lines were also indented and only applied to the Arch workaround.

The reason is that if platform.linux_distribution() starts returning weird values on other distros, the workaround for Arch may not be appropriate and we may set version and os_version to an inappropriate value on these distros. I favor having an explicit human review when things break in the future. And that means making the workaround as narrow as possible.

Along that vein, is the new value of "release" overwriting an earlier set value? Again, I'd prefer we only do this for Arch if it is.

That's fair enough. The error I run into was fairly cryptic (a ParseError in mochitest) and took some digging to find the source of the problem; that's why I originally wanted to return at least some value if platform.linux_distribution() starts acting up.

Perhaps the Right Way is to make mozinfo.py throw a warning/exception if any of the values isn't present, or to handle the error more gracefully in mochitest.

Turns out `release` was set to the right value near the beginning of mozinfo.py[1], so I was in fact overwriting it (but with the same value!) It's cleaner now.
