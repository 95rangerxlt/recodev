Per bug 359959 comment 16, these should be fixed. It's possible that this won't be supported in the new patch in bug 319654.

These are the two examples I've seen:

What about seamonkey, thunderbird, etc?  Do they not have any files with this issue?
They probably do, but we don't have a component for "fix something in the whole tree", so I filed the bug here. I'll probably write something to check this automatically.
If this is something that authors have used often, and will now not work the same way, then you should also post a message to m.d.platform and the project_owners list.

Neil, sure.

A quick script (looking for "<overlay" or ":overlay" before "<?") weirdly only finds hits in browser/ (of the whole tree). Some of these may be false positives, although that's not very likely:

c:\mozilla\browser\base\content\downloadManagerOverlay.xul: FAIL
c:\mozilla\browser\base\content\extensionsManagerOverlay.xul: FAIL
c:\mozilla\browser\base\content\jsConsoleOverlay.xul: FAIL

Unfortunately I can't test this, since I don't have a Mac.

What about browser/base/content/macBrowserOverlay.xul ?

Indeed, it works much better including the one that crashes us at startup :)
Probably need to move the xul-stylesheet PIs there too....

Oops, needed to move the stylesheets, too.

With macBrowserOverlay.xul v.2

With *all* of it, this time, I hope.
Doesn't that last patch change the order of the overlay and stylesheets?  I doubt that's really needed (or desirable).

Sigh. I was also putting them between the (#included) doctype and the <overlay> element, which whether or not it matters just isn't done.

Checked in.
Phil, thanks for catching that!
Edited http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers to mention this and posted this: http://groups-beta.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.xul/browse_frm/thread/1d4be633082f5099/36085ddb5b956a58#36085ddb5b956a58

what i can use this BUG
How can a bug that's already fixed block the release?
We could probably do with updating the examples on MDC to stop recommending this
Are there any specific examples in need of update?
Of course I can't find the one I copied from earlier now, but there is definitely some example there.
Found one case where this was done and changed it.  Marking as doc-complete; if anyone finds other examples of this, fix 'em. :)
