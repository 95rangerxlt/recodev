Doesn't http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css#673 need to be updated as well?

I don't think it is necessary because it is already specified on line 1117 http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css#1117, but I can go ahead and make that change and upload another patch if you would like.
