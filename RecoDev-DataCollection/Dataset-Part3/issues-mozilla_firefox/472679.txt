We have aria logic that no longer part of the specification. We should either document that in the code, or remove it.

This bug was created as some work towards this has started on bug 452388. Discussion on obsolete ARIA should happen here.

Update: I'll remove aria-datatype logic here.
Surkov, why does nsXFormsAccessible::GetAttributesInternal set a datatype property?

It was introduced in bug 367256. Since ARIA droped datatype usage then xforms is unique thing that exposes datatype to AT. If we don't need this and nobody uses it then I think we can drop the support of datatype at all.

Aaron can you give this a quick look, and also, can you comment on why datatype was dropped? Surkov wants to know and I can't remember the details.

Trivial patch.

Please update any docs on wiki.mo or dev.mo or codetalks, etc.
Regarding datatype, I think it may happen in ARIA 2.0. We couldn't agree on a good way to do it. It required namespaces, which wasn't good for HTML. At some point we might look at how Web Forms 2 does data types.

It would be nice to have for alternative input. Gone, but not forgotten.
Right, great for word prediction. Thank Aaron, we'll add it back if/when needed.

Updated codetalks for now.
David, when you will update devmo then please don't remove docs for datatype attribute completely, just mark it doesn't exposed in firefox 3.2 any more.
