Steps to reproduce:

Images using an indexed color space are not rendered correctly when the PDF is encrypted
See the attached examples:
- unencrypted.pdf contains one image (originally a GIF) with an indexed color space and one image (JPEG) using a regular DeviceRGB color space; both images are displayed correctly
- encrypted.pdf is the same document, but encrypted (using PDFtk 1.44); in the image using an indexed color spaces, the colors are completely wrong
