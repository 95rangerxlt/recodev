Updating the URL that "View Pocket List" in the bookmarks menu links to so that we can detect it and provide a specific experience for Firefox users as needed.

Just added "?src=ff_ext" to the end of the URL.

Note: This is my first attempt at submitting a patch, so feedback welcome if I should process this differently.

Pocket.site is getpocket.com, so this is creating https://getpocket.com?src=ff_ext which appears to work but I'm used to seeing a slash after the TLD and before the question mark.

Updated the link to include a slash per Jared's recommendation.
