In order to get things started you need to require both 'gcli/index' and a custom startup for content and chrome. This spreads around the dependencies and make is harder to work out what goes where.

Since gcli/index is tiny, we should have 2 startup files. One for chrome and the other for content. This makes it clear where things live.
