getZOrderDOMWindowEnumerator seems to be working only on Windows.  We need to adjust the #ifdefs at the following places accordingly:

Bug 456439 will be adding another copy of this code to nsBrowserGlue.js as well.
Yeah... we need to fix this.

bug 156333 is the longstanding Linux bustage.
As per comment 2, dunno why he didn't flip the flag himself ;)
Looks like this isn't going to get fixed on Mac anytime soon. Ehsan, do you have a good understanding of the changes we need to handle this?
Without the dependencies being fixed, there is nothing to do here.  This bug is mostly about removing the conditional code inside of BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER blocks, once the dependencies are fixed.

Given that bug 450576 is blocking1.9.1-, and bug 156333 is wanted1.9.1+, I'm not sure how this one ended up being blocking1.9.1+.  Turning the flag to ? for reconsideration.
bug 450576 was previously blocking but josh has concluded that it is too risky to take for 1.9.1, so we can't block here either.
Pretty sure we still have to fix the ifdefs so that we don't assume mac will work...

don't assume that mac works

this is what nsPrivateBrowsingService.js already does
The patch in bug 462478 would make this one simpler.

This is "fine" for now, but we should stay on top of this for .next
Connor, this is blocking, but there's a checked in patch? I think we want to:

 - close this bug
 - open a new bug with a description of what has to change
 - make that bug blocking, if you believe it needs to be
 - make sure that bug has an assignee

Assigning this to mconnor for now to handle.
After further discussion with mconnor - this doesn't block. mconnor does still believe we should fix it, instead of just assuming broken z order everywhere except windows. It may well belong in its own bug instead of here, but either way, marking it blocking-.
while on Mac it is working it still fails on Linux. Is there anything we can do here to get this enumerator fixed?
Looks like this is working now across platforms. Ehsan, can you verify that?
The code in question doesn't exist any more.
It still exists. (See the URL field.)
Oh, right, it was moved... by me! ;-)
What I wanted to say in comment 17 is that we have a test for Mozmill which makes use of the getZOrderDOMWindowEnumerator and works well across platforms. So I wonder if those remaining ifdef declarations are still necessary.
According to bug 874566, the ZOrder enumerator now works on Mac, so updating this accordingly.

Please continue that discussion in bug 450576. Once resolved, we should update this bug, and file a bug on updating our BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER logic.
This bug doesn't seem useful anymore.
I morphed bug 891194 into being about fixing BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER
