Is it expected that you still get a 1px right border when hovering on the list buttons?

Also, can we give the actual projects the same smaller fonts size as "new app"?  Runtime already uses the small size consistently, so that would make them match.

I left it in there specifically because that was the way we had it before. I did do some cleanup such that it wouldn't be overwhelming with buttons and only would look that way if you hover over. We could take it out though, I'm open to either.

If we're removing the "buttony" appearance (lighter background, borders), then I don't think it makes sense for the borders to show up on hover.

Did you not like the button look?  Was it strange at the lower width?

I think the button look was a bit overwhelming on the interface (we already have the sidebars showing and then the buttons from the UI are vying for visual attention). Originally I think the reason for keeping it that way was because it was an easy assignment to .panel-item but that just applied it to everything.

Please adjust the font size that I mentioned in comment 5.

Since refresh is staying button-like, it should keep its right border, I think.
