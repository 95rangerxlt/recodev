Build ID: 20150702173756

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox Developer Edition already uses the lw-theme way to handle developer theme. There is no need to keep 'browser.devedition.theme.enabled' pref anymore.

It only makes things harder to distinguish between versions with and without developer theme usage.

Nightly channel does a great job, where this preference got removed a while ago.

This suggests the pref is not cleared on purpose, but I don't know much about it.

We can remove it now.  I had just left it around in case the lw theme change had problems and had to get backed out, but at this point we should get rid of it.

deved-theme-pref.patch

Removes the pref from firefox.js and prefs_general.js.  Didn't make any changes to the migration stuff in nsBrowserGlue though since I think we still want to handle migrations in the same way.

Didn't we also change the talos configuration? Probably want to update that too if we haven't already...

Good point.  Joel, here is a patch to remove this unused pref from the talos config.  What do you think?

Nightly and let it ride the trains would be best

What I did wonder is... are we still disabling this theme (by using the relevant lwtheme pref, or something?) on devedition on talos? And if not, I wonder if that's some cheap aurora talos wins... ;-)

We have 'lightweightThemes.selectedThemeID' set to "" in http://hg.mozilla.org/build/talos/file/b4b41ebeec41/talos/PerfConfigurator.py#l447 so it should be already be unapplied.
