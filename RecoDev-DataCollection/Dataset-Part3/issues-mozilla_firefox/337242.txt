When I open Firefox i see the toolbars and the tab-headers, but the windows themself are see-thru. Meaning: I can see my desktop and the skelleton of Firefox, but no websites. I hope you understand what I mean. I have even installed Firefox new, but the problem is still there.

Reproducible: Always
