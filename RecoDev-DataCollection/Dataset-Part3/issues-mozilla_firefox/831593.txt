During the Firefox update process the program "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\uninstall\helper.exe" runs.  One of the actions this program takes is to delete the registry value located at: "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers\C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe".

If performing an uninstall or reinstall of Firefox this action makes sense.  It will help "fix" problems associated with the user or another program changing the application compatibility flags to ones that break Firefox.  Thus a reinstall would "fix" the problem.

However, when this action is taken during an upgrade of Firefox it causes any flags intentionally set by the user to be removed.  Several of the flags are useful, but the one I'm most interested in is HIGHDPIAWARE (Disable display scaling on high DPI settings).  

Due to a bug in Firefox/Flash (bug 697369), the Windows taskbar is not hidden when viewing full-screen Flash on a Windows system with the system-wide DPI settings changed to be larger than normal (see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-the-text-on-your-screen-larger-or-smaller).

To work around this bug you can the AppCompatFlags to mark Firefox as not being high-DPI aware, which fixes the problem.  However, because the updater removes this registry value, the user has to reset the flag every time Firefox updates.  Given the increased rate of Firefox releases this is becoming a significant annoyance; on my home-theater PC watching full-screen Flash video (such as YouTube) means re-applying this setting every couple of weeks.  Other browsers do not have this problem.

I would suggest modifying helper.exe so that it does NOT remove this registry value during a Firefox upgrade.  The program is currently run with the command-line argument "/PostUpdate", which suggests it should already know when an update is being performed.

I'm not sure when this issue was introduced, but I first noticed it during the Firefox 12/13 timeframe. It is still present as of the Firefox 18 upgrade.

Thanks.

Perhaps... we've also had several bugs from users in a state where these were set and they don't know how or how to unset them. It was added a long time ago to help these users and until now there has not been a single bug report of this being a problem. With that being the case I'd prefer keeping it and instead the bug which needs this to workaround it being fixed.
I understand the reasoning behind wiping the compatibility flags during a normal install/reinstall, but why do it during an automatic upgrade?  They are user settings and those shouldn't normally be modified by a program without consent.

Yes, this is the first bug report against this 'feature', but I don't think that makes it any less valid.  In the last few weeks I've had to reset the DPI flag on my parent's HTPC Firefox about 5 times (17, 17.0.1, 17.0.2, 18, 18.0.1).  Every time it updates any sites that use Flash for video stop going fullscreen without showing the Taskbar (thankfully Netflix is Silverlight).  

I realize that in my case this is the result of another bug, but surely there are those out there who set the flags for some other reason.  And, for that matter, the bug that's giving me grief is still UNCONFIRMED after over a year, even though you can find lots of people asking about it in forums (with changing the DPI compat flag always being the answer).

I'm pretty new to Firefox bug reporting -- what steps should be taken to get either this issue or the fullscreen Flash issue (or preferably both!) moved away from UNCONFIRMED and towards a solution?

Thanks again.
Regarding this bug, there are many other bugs that are much more serious and affect many more users that take precedent. Regarding the full screen flash issue chances are the same is true regarding resources to fix the bug and as long as there are reliable steps to reproduce it should be taken care of when resources to fix it become available.
This was added in bug 370571 and was added due to these values being added by Windows Vista when not including a manifest. Let's go ahead and remove them.
