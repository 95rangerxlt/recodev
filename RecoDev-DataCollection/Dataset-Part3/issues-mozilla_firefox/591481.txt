Bump compat to 4.0.*

This should do it? (Are we making a habit of bumping the testpilot version number, too? I noticed you did for the b5 version of this patch.)

[Aside: do we have a bug blocking final to turn feedback off?]

I've been bumping the version in the past but in this cases no changes have actually landed for feedback so no version change seems necessary.

We do now, bug 594858
Pushed to mozilla-central
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/75f87884fa18
This needs to land on the GECKO20b5_20100831_RELBRANCH ASAP.

Could we please preprocess the install.rdf file to insert MOZ_APP_VERSION, so we don't have to remember this. eg 
 http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/generic/install.rdf
 http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/profile/extensions/%7B972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd%7D/install.rdf.in
Don't think it's needed anymore, since we just made the maxVer 4.0.*
Unless you want to ship it in 4.x or 5.x...
