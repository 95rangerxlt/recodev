Pretty Print currently does:

switch (x) {
case a:
  foo();
  break;
default:
  bar()
}

CodeMirror Shift-Tab and
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style#Control_Structures
do and say respectively:

switch (x) {
  case a:
    foo();
    break;
  default:
    bar()
}

I am separating my implementation from Bug 975477 comment 5 now in the hope they will be more acceptable separately.

We don't use the mdn coding style in devtools, but I'll take a look at the code and if it doesn't complicate things too much I'll r+.

Can't see enough context, when you upload patches make sure you format them with 8 lines of context. See the -U 8 stuff here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Creating_a_patch_that_can_be_checked_in

However, in this special case where pretty-fast is an upstream project, can you just submit PRs there and then I can just merge upstream when PRs land.
Needs test(s) as well.
OK, I'll submit a PR with test.

Oh wait, there is an existing switch indentation test that will fail with my patch.
Shouldn't I just update that and be done with the test coverage?
Sounds good.
