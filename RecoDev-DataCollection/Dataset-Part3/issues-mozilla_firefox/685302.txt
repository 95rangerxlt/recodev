In Preferences->Privacy->Tracking, "websites" should be one word next to the DNT check box: "Tell websites I do not want to be tracked"
It would be an easy fix to change this one string, but we seem to use both "website" and "web site" all over the product, and it looks like there more instances of "web site":

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=website&find=locale&findi=&filter=%5E%5B%5E%5C0%5D*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=web+site&find=locale&findi=&filter=%5E%5B%5E%5C0%5D*%24&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla-central

What's the right thing to do? Is this a problem we want to solve more generally?
Would be great to be consistent throughout. "Website" is our style for Mozilla communications, so that would be my strong preference. Is it realistic to change it everywhere?
I'd be in favor of a cleanup, at least starting with the more common strings. I'm cc'ing Limi to see what he thinks.
Also cc'ing l10n because I'm curious how localizers treat "website" vs. "web site". If they're treated differently, perhaps this would also be a good time to clean up those translations.
For es-ES both have the same translation, is there any difference in English?

No difference in English. It's just a matter of style.

Same thing in Italian, and honestly it seems quite strange having two different translations for "web sites" and "websites".

I'm pretty curious. My guess is that it's the same, given the ubiquity of the Web, but I can also imagine a language where there might be subtle differences in how the two words would be translated vs. just one.

patch for dnt pref

Here's a patch for the DNT pref. Matej, if we take this patch, will you be communicating this change to people who include screenshots of this pref pane in their communications materials, like the new DNT Field Guide?

patch for dnt pref

You don't need a new entity name for this.
Yeah, what dao says. We can do a a post in .l10n in addition to the communication in this bug to ask people to be consistent.

Also, looking at http://www.frenchmozilla.fr/transvision/index.php?recherche=web+sites&locale=fr&repo=aurora&regular=regular, we're having a bigger problem with web sites ;-)

I'll have to figure out the best way to do that, but yes, I'll make sure we're using the correct screenshot from here on out. When would that make its way into the browser?

If this gets reviewed it would be in Nightly very soon, on the Firefox 9 train.

Not much to review here anymore. Maybe this should get a ui-review.

What's this about?
> exporting patch:
> <fdopen>
FYI, we have an open bug for switching everything consistently to "website" in the browser, but so far I think we don't have anyone who did a patch for that.
I did this for SeaMonkey some time ago, but I think int Firefox we still have inconsistent mentions of "site", "web site" and "website" even though the latter should be used ideally.

Good to hear. Definitely should be "website" where possible, but "site" can also be used if space is an issue (as I imagine it might be for mobile).
in dutch everything is translated as website

Limi told me that he was in favor of making this change everywhere.

I'm not sure what's up with that. It looks like my system adds that when I pipe the output of hg export to a file.

change "web site" to "website" in all strings

I just did a string replace on all .dtd and .properties files. I looked through the patch to make sure there weren't any unwanted changes, and it looks good to me, but I think this is big enough that another set of eyes wouldn't hurt :)

This should be "websites" (lowercase). r=me with that

So this is basically either a dependency or even a dupe of bug 385452 now? We should mark those bugs in bugzilla somehow to belong together in some way...

Oops, I didn't know that bug existed. I'm going to dupe it to this one, since this is where we made the patch.
*** Bug 385452 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

See bug 249231 and various others for some background on this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website#Spelling and the sources listed there seem to suggest that "website" is the way forward.
