Merge the "Go" button into the location bar as described in FF2 UI specs.

I'm surprised this isn't filed yet, but I can't find it.

Merge the "Go" button into the location bar as described in FF2 UI specs.

I'm surprised this isn't filed yet, but I can't find it.
Which specs? I see http://wiki.mozilla.org/Location_Bar where someone added in the  "one go/refresh/stop button to rule them all," but I don't see any "stick the go button inside the location bar and enrage the people who hate it" spec.
The discussion in

http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/User_Interface_Design

and

http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/6947a05fed1e088c/73c66a86dd3cf11d?

never reached a completely firm conclusion that I could see.  I thought it was decided to "dock" the button onto the end of the location bar, but then I noticed that some of the discussion in bug 337725 comment #11 puts it inside.

Whichever it ends up, it'll probably need some programming work as well as the new graphics to get it to behave nicely; that's what this bug is meant to track.
It will take unnecessary space for people who never use a go button. I use a go button, but most people have it in their customize window when they need space for other stuff on their toolbars.
In old Phoenix the go button was even not on the toolbar by default.
I hope that it does not break themes? Can you still use the old one in your theme?

I think it would be more discoverable if the go button, however it ends up, has a context menu that allows the address that is typed in to open either in a new tab or in a new window.  I'm hoping that could easily be implemented as part of this change.  

I often find myself forgetting which keyboard shortcut does what after typing an address.  If the context menu included the keyboard shortcut then it would be easy to double check the keyboard shortcuts.  

I also think the change of merging the go button with the address bar is acceptable so long as implemented as shown in the mockups.  That way the button is smaller than the current go button.

On the other hand, it saves space if it's merged with the Reload button as concluded at http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/User_Interface_Design (also see my edited mockup: http://design-noir.de/bugzilla/fx2-theme-02.png).

Actually, I've removed both Go and Reload, so it would still add space for me. But when looking at the new theme mockup, I don't see why the new button shouldn't be removable.
So a themable draggable inline-looking go-search twin button that is not bigger or smaller than the current one (must be an easy target to click) with a context-menu and non-irritating qualities. Where is the wonder designer? :)

> draggable

Not necessarily. Removing could be achieved via userChrome.css / extension.
will the text "Type a location into the location bar, and click Go" 
and "Stop loading this page" that happens on hovering over the current buttons remain the same and be displayed depending on the state of the button? 

or would we develop some new hybrid to describe the multi-functions provided for the space taken by the button?  

if the later this might need late-l10n keyword...

As far as I know, we're not combining the buttons.  They'll stay separate Stop, Refresh, and Go.  See http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/Default_Theme_Update#Design_Mockups
Or do I misunderstand the question?

A /design/ mockup shouldn't dictate the UI, should it? I mean, the picture also shows "Go" instead of "History". I think it's about graphics and necessary chrome enhancements. But in terms of UI, much more has been discussed (and actually "decided") here:
http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/User_Interface_Design
Multi-state buttons aren't happening any time soon.  The "wasted" space is maybe 20-25px, same as the search button.   See http://steelgryphon.com/random/firstStepsRC.png

We understand that this isn't going to be universally popular, but the highly space-optimized edgecase where this still matters can use userChrome.css or another theme.  There was talk about how to allow people to remove the Go button, but we conclused it isn't worth it to add a bunch of special-cased code for an edge case.

-> mglenn, since this is part of the patch for the main window icon replacement bug

But it's true that users don't need Go and Reload at the same time. Hence I don't think it would be "highly space-optimized" as in "over-optimized". It's all intuitive, IMHO.

As a side note, IE7 also combines the buttons (and I wouldn't be surprised if they were inspired by the Mozilla wiki page :)).

Anyway ... It's not my decision and I don't want to engage you in endless discussions.
This is fixed now.
Please change it back to the behavior of FF 1.5 !!

In Firefox 1.5 I was able to work without the Go-Button to save space in the layout.

Now in 2.0b2 (en/Windows) I can't remove it any longer, if I remove it, the location bar also gets removed.

Also it looks pretty ugly since the Go-button doesn't have the same height as the location bar. Also the border of the button is open on the left side which is very non-standard in FF. No other icon has a border around it.

I've never understood what this button is for: When I'm typing the URL with my keyboard I press enter when I'm completed and the page gets loaded. Why do I need to move the mouse to this button and press it ?
When the auto-complete combo-box in the location bar comes up I use the cursor keys to find the right item and press enter, so this button is rather useless.

I love FF and I'd like to continue loving it.
