1. Load the attached URL
2. Right click to go full screen
3. Hit [ESC]

Then the video dims and there's a large X in the middle of the screen.  If you mouse click the X in the upper right hand corner the video goes away, but you're left with a spinner in the middle of the video.  Something isn't right in the event handling or internal controls.


Tested on a 9 bet on Windows.

That's using the existing video full-screen code path (not the DOM full-screen API). Once we switch to using the DOM full-screen API for the video controls to go full-screen, ESC won't cancel the video load.

We should keep the fallback code around, so we should preventDefault() on ESC key press in the old video full-screen code.
As cpearce said, we should add an event handler for the ESC key and use preventDefault().

The changes should be made in /browser/base/content/fullscreen-video.xhtml
Is this bug in 10?  We should fix it in 9, I suspect, which is already in beta.
HI I am interested in working with this bug! Could you guide me on how to proceed? I am a new contributor here! Thanks!
Hi VD, thanks for taking this bug. Now that the fullscreen API is enabled by default, to work on this you should disable the fullscreen API by going to about:config and setting the full-screen-api.enabled to false.

I've placed steps to fix this bug in comment #2. Please let me know if I should explain more.
Issue is also reproducible on Firefox 10 ESR:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0

Hi VD. I apologize but I am on vacation/traveling this week so I may be slow to respond to emails.

Here is the steps to get started on this bug:
1) Go to about:confing and set full-screen-api.enabled to false
2) Open /browser/base/content/fullscreen-video.xhtml
3) Add a keydown event handler and check for the ESC key being the key that is pressed.
4) If the ESC key is being pressed, call event.preventDefault().

Let me know if that is not clear or if you would like more help.
HI! I was thinking about adding it to the already existent keypress handler! would that make a difference? 

DOM_VK_ESCAPE is the Esc key right? 

Also my main problem is I have Firefox 9 built in Ubuntu and Firefox 9 on windows vista! but I  am unable to reproduce this bug in either! It seems to work fine! I click on the link, right click on video and go to full screen and press esc, It comes out of full screen! There is no fading or X mark in the centre in this case! 

On Ubuntu sometimes when I press Esc without going on full screen, I get a faded video with a X mark in the centre! 

Could you help me clarify if I have understood the bug!
Also could you explain step 1! How do I go to about:config?
We should just remove fullscreen-video.xhtml now that we shipped the full-screen API.
VD, do you want to do that?
Yup sure! Just remove the entire file right? Could you see Comment 9 and tell me if I have understood the question correctly? So it would be easy to check if the issue is sorted!

Thanks!
It's more work than just removing fullscreen-video.xhtml. The code referencing that file also needs to be updated: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=fullscreen-video.xhtml&find=browser

With that being done, you don't need to do anything else for this bug, as it only exists within fullscreen-video.xhtml.
This fallback is still used when <video> is inside of an iframe that doesn't have the mozallowfullscreen attribute.

If we remove fullscreen-video.xhtml, we will also need to update the nsContextMenu.js to either disable the fullscreen context menuitem or remove it from the context menu in this case.
fullScreenVideo: function () {
    let video = this.target;
    if (document.mozFullScreenEnabled)
      video.mozRequestFullScreen();
    else {
      // Fallback for the legacy full-screen video implementation.
      video.pause();
      openDialog("chrome://browser/content/fullscreen-video.xhtml",
                  "", "chrome,centerscreen,dialog=no", video);
    }
  },

yup! exactly wat i was about to ask!
'document' is the chrome document there. I don't see how document.mozFullScreenEnabled would be false if the video element is in an iframe.
Oh sorry, you're right. I forgot about bug 691947 which relaxed the security constraints if the request came from chrome.
So shall i go ahead and remove the fullscreen-video.xhtml file and file references? 
and in this case (Comment 15) shall i remove openDialog completely or should i replace it with some other file?

Please remove the whole else block.

You need to also execute 'hg rm browser/base/content/fullscreen-video.xhtml' before creating the diff.

Is this going to be fixed on the esr branch also?
