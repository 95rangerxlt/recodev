I've about 600 bookmarks.

When I make "Bookmark This Page..." or "Manage Bookmarks... > New Bookmark
                                                            > New Folder
                                                            > New Separator"

I find the new item at this place [1].
I can move a existing or the new bookmark to a new place too [2].

[1] But after a close/open firefox, I don't find the new item: deleted.
[2] And the existing bookmark comes back to this previous place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a change in the Bookmarks file like add new item
(bookmark/folder/separator) or move an exiting bookmark.
2. Find the change with the right display or the Bookmarks Toolbar
3. Close/Open Firefox.


Actual Results:  
No Add/Change is saved

Expected Results:  
Add news bookmarks and keep them !!
