Background :#EDEDED - #F4F4F4 (from Tools – Web Developer – Eyedropper)
Contrast Ratio is only 2.53

The contrast Ratio should be more than 4.5 at least.

If this is a regression, do you know which bug regressed this?
dcrobot, with the new background color going to be a solid #F9F9F9, what should the text color be to have appropriate contrast?
Fyi, using http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html

Setting a background of F9F9F9 and foreground of 737373 results in contrast ratio of 4.5
A similar contrast bug 1051861 is for the gear icon. Perhaps we should also change the fill color of the gear to be 737373 (or whatever we end up for the text).
