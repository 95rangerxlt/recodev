patch and test

In order to keep sessionstore.js small and to remain compatible with Betas 1 and 2, this patch special-cases <input type="file">. AFAICT this is the only privacy sensitive of our input elements (please correct me now, if I'm wrong!).

On a side-note: The same vulnerability works the other way round, as well: If the user selects a file, it'd be possible to get the full file path instead of just the filename. Both patch and test take care of both ways.

... besides <input type="password"> which we single out already.
Do we still need 1.8.1 patches, anyway?

Minor update to the test: Let's also make sure that <input type="file"> restoration wasn't broken in the same circumstances.
This has been placed on our "Top Security Bugs" list.  Please treat as a top priority.

Several vendors will continue to support Firefox 2 longer than MoCo, so yeah, it's extremely helpful.
We're going to wait for 1.9.1 approval and landing before approving for the older branches, but why is 1.9.1 so different from 1.9.0 here? That would seem to call for a separate review.

Because with all the improvements on 1.9.1 we can actually distinguish type="file" from type="text" and restore both whereas on older branches we can't and thus just have to ignore type="file" during both saving and restoring.

Dietrich: The second bit has been included in the 1.9.1 patch and the first bit is equal to the type="password" one. Please nod if I haven't missed anything.
