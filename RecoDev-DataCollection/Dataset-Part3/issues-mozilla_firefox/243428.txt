I can confim this behavior with my MOZILLA_1_7_BRANCH builds since the 9. May. I
didn't do one on the 8., and on the 7. the world was still in good shape.
might that be related to mconnor's checkin on 2004-05-08?

Thank you for the screen shot!

Do you know who changed this bug's status to "unconfirmed"?

AFAIK it is unconfirmed until someone sets it to "NEW"
not only the "+" icons are wrong, the whole dialog is messed up. The Icons on
the left, the borders, etc.

It reproduced with the trunk version nightly build 5-13.
This is a regression, isn't it?
Could the reporter or another empowered user set the keyword, please?

Uh... What keyword can be good?
well, "regression" would be nice. ;)
I don't THINK I touched anything that should do this, but it could be linked to 
the build process that sets up the mac skin.  Kevin, any idea on what 
could/might be causing this?
Did some investigating and I think it's caused by Ben's theme manager checkin.
Specifically http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/skin/mac/jar.mn#36

This is what I see in my terminal when I make in browser/base

...and this also applies to the advanced section (and in any place this widget
is used).

Should be fixed before a the next release.
ben was going to look into this sometime this week, anyone want to build the 
aviary branch to properly test this? :)
I have to admit that I don't know what a "aviary branch" is. 
I am building from the MOZILLA_1_7_BRANCH as often as interesting changes have
been made. So if there is a checkin related to this bug, I will build again. :)
*** Bug 243768 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I also noticed the icon styling in Preferences appears to have gone back to Qute from Pinstripe.
Present in both Firefox and Thunderbird.
Could somebody please give me a pointer (explanation/URL) what this
AVIARY_1_0_20040515_BRANCH is?
I could build from that one, too, if I knew what it is...
OK, now I know what this branch is. I built it this morning and have to say that
the whole branch seems br0ken somehow :( 
I hope it gets better soon...
Nevertheless, I will switch to building AVIARY-branch. At least as long as there
are no official nighties.
My nighties can be found here: (in case somebody wants to test them ;) )

Works for 20040508 firefox nightly build, but broken the next day (20040509).
Ah.. I donwnloaded Windows version (May. 19). It seems to have broken preference
styling. May. 19 version has lots of problems. 
May 25 version still has broken styling.

AVIARY_1_0_20040515_BRANCH and trunk are still reproduced. :-(

It seems that the wrong pref.css is getting packaged.  In classic.jar, we are getting the file from 
browser/components/prefwindow/skin/pref.css rather than browser/base/skin/mac/pref.css.  If I 
manually add browser/base/skin/mac/pref.css to classic.jar in a nightly build, then the problem goes 
away.  No idea yet why we are getting the wrong file.
The files Bookmarks-toolbar.png, BookmarksManager.css, Options.png, and pref.css are stored in 
classic.jar in the browser/base/skin/mac directory, but are overwritten with non-Mac specific versions 
in browser/components/bookmarks/skin and browser/components/prefwindow/skin.
Nothing changed in the build system on the date that this issue appeared.  The
only thing I can think of is that since all four files that I mentioned above
were changed on 2004-05-08, they have later dates than the mac specific files
and make-jars.pl chooses to take these "newer" files to overwrite the mac files.

So it seems that the build has always been somewhat broken.  I think that the
pinstripe building should come last, so that it can overwrite all the generic files.
Created attachment 149515
possible patch

Ugly, but it works.
Another bug in the build system is that the rsync step (creates the .app bundle)
should be the last thing run in the build.  The Firefox build goes on to build
the extensions directory after the rsync step.
Created attachment 149518
better patch

This patch puts the browser/app directory last, so that rsync is the last thing
that is run in the Firefox build.

However, I am still seeing the problem where make-jars.pl will not overwrite
the files since those files in browser/components/prefwindow have a later CVS
checkout date than those in browser/base/skin/mac.  Is there any way to specify
to make-jars.pl that some files should always overwrite a preexisting file in a
jar, no matter what the date?
what we really need to do is to make packaging of the skin an either/or
function, if we're building on mac, we shouldn't be building qute and then
building pinstripe, we should just build pinstripe.
This is unrelated to the errors you're seeing, which are nonfatal and I think
related to the theme icon. 

This is a problem relating to the fact that the Windows theme files seem to be
being built on OS X for some reason (not exactly sure why) and then the Mac
files are being built later, and are not replacing the Windows files because the
Windows files (as of Arvid's latest update) have a newer mtime. 

The standard mechanism for dealing with this problem is to prefix the lines of
the affected files in jar.mn with '+'... This forces the files to overwrite any
existing files. 

Ultimately I think the solution to the problem that caused this is a clean
separation of the theme directories.

Ensure the Mac preferences theme stuff overwrites any existing matter.
Fixed branch and trunk.

It still reproduces.

I tried last nightly and it is still very reproduces :-\
the last nightly would have been built before this was checked in.  However,
this likely doesn't fix the bookmarks manager, if that's indeed broken.
(In reply to comment #33)
As I mentioned in comment #28, the Mac pinstripe theme is actually built first,
and then overwritten by the Qute theme files.  So your change will have no
effect, unless it is merged with my change, which puts the pinstripe theme
building at the end.
What I'm confused about is why Qute is being built at all on Mac. Pinstripe is
completely independent and shares nothing with it.
Sorry, I may have misspoken.  Qute itself (in browser/base/skin) is not getting
built.  However, the theme files in browser/components/bookmarks/skin and
browser/components/prefwindow/skin (and possibly other directories) are getting
built.  Four of the files in these two directories are duplicates of files in
browser/base/skin/mac, and are overwriting the mac files.
Ah. I see now, thanks Javier. 

I have shall we say an "interesting" fix for this bug coming in the next week. 
This looks fixed to me now, branch only. Will be fixed trunk after theme
restructuring lands there this week. 
Well, in my AVIARY build, checked out last night (2004-06-07, 00:15UTC), it is
still broken.
When did you check in the patch? I haven't found anything yet.
This problem was fixing by Firefox which built by AVIARY BRANCH today.

Yes. It is fixed.
However.. On Preference->Downloads->FileTypes list, no icon is displayed
as it does with the Windows version. Maybe it is different issue, though.

This seems to be fixed on trunk, too. I can see the icons with a trunk nighty:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040726
Firefox/0.9.1+

It is *not* fixed on the AVIARY branch, but I guess it is a different issue.
Maybe  a bug exists already.
