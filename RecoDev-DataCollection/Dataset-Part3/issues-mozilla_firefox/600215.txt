johnath: I want to fix this bug after all major code changes have landed, but not at the very last minute such that it causes release-driver stress. Can you give me some timing guidance, either in absolute (e.g. 23rd November) or relative (e.g. 5 days after the release of RC1) terms?

Gerv
5 days after RC1 would be too late, since RC1 should be the code we intend to ship, barring last minute discoveries. And a date guideline is a trick - there's a lot of blockers and they'll move as they move, but I understand you wanting to get this squared away.

Honestly, I'd say you probably want to aim to do this around end of October/mid-November and if code lands after that which introduces a new Initial Developer, we'll need a follow up for it.

Sure ;-) It was an example. 

I'll put a note in my diary for the end of October. It only takes 10 minutes to fix with the tools I've got.

Patch v.1

This list was generated today from mozilla-central and comm-central.

To be clear to anyone reading this bug: this list is not a list of credits, it is a technical license-compliance issue. There are no kudos attached to being on the list or off it. It is generated by a machine reading license headers. 

This may be the last time we need to do this, as the advent of MPL 2 (if the Mozilla project chooses to move our codebase to it) will make this list unnecessary, as the relevant license provision has been removed as it is a pain in the behind.

Patch v.1

No need to request explicit approval, this is a triaged hardblocker - it gets to land ahead of everything else.

Which means you removed the Camino initial developers (again!), which you had me re-add on m-c in bug 553138 comment 4. :P

Also, I suspect any Mobile products from mozilla-central/Gecko 2.0 are going to be out of compliance if the list "continues" to be generated only from mozilla-central and comm-central rather than from all mozilla.org app/product repositories ;-)

Smokey: sorry! 

(But if your fix patch had also updated the text at the top with a new date and tree name, it might have given me the hint... :-)

Remind me which tree I also need to scan? Presumably "camino"?

I have no idea how I missed that. :(

Yes (and for Fennec/mobile products I believe it's "mobile-browser", though it's probably best to double-check with an actual Fennec dev).

Patch v.1b

Here's an additional patch, restoring the names of the Camino developers, and updating the comment. My apologies.
