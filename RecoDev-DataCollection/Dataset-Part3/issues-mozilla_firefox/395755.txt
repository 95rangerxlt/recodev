I wanted to subscribe to a blogwith a long name. Unfortunately, the RSS subscribe menu then becomes useless, because you can't see WHERE to subscribe to it. 

For example, I want to subscribe it to my Google Reader, but I can't tell which item that is. (That part of the menu is clipped off.)

See the screenshot.

That seems to be a screenshot showing that you have no information to let you decide whether to preview the RSS feed or the Atom feed. We could switch to butchering it with crop=center (the reason I never use the bookmark menu on OS X), and then you would have no information to let you decide which one to preview, since you don't know Blogger's business plans about feed format support or Google Reader's internal abilities to handle feed formats.

I think that change makes sense. Without it, there is no way to tell what the menuitems actually DO. And enough of the blog title is included for it to be obvious what page it is referring to.

Um, again, it's not going to tell you what it's going to DO, no matter what - that depends on how your prefs are set, whether it's going to show a preview or send you off to a website or open a local app. However, ugly as the attachment 280626 double-ellipses are, at least it does show you why there are two items, that you have no basis for choosing between, and it doesn't replace our "you're going to have to provide more input (unless, of course, you aren't, depending on your prefs)" ellipsis with a "not showing the whole thing" ellipsis.
