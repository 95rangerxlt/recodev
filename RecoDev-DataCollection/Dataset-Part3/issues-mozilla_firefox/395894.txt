raw version. patch coming

I was looking through lxr today for something and came across the places.dtd files, man what an eyesore to read. So I took the liberty of cleaning it up to fix the spacing/line break/tabs or whatever else you want to call it. I thought the file would have been small since less lines but for some reason the file ended up bigger...weird?  Anyways I posted the text file here incase someone wants to create a patch before I get home this evening.

I think dietrich just made changes to this file (for bug #387740), so I think this patch has bit-rotted.

thanks Kurt.

drivers: this makes life easier for localizers, as well as improving readability, which will help prevent bugs like bug 396689.
Checking in browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/places/places.dtd;

view.columns.label  is now defined twice. Not good, indeed.

> Not good, indeed.

And not this bug, indeed. Not caused by it, as you could see by counting the number of them in the "-" lines, and not something this bug is responsible for fixing, as you could see by reading comment 5.

ouch, sorry. CVS blame only shows the last version of this file, hence, I thought those strings came with it.

My bad.
*hides in the bushes*
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
