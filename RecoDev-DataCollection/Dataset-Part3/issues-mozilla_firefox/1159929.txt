When doing some netmonitor profiling, we discovered that checking a pref on every emitted event was taking up a not-insignificant amount of time: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/event-emitter.js#150.

We should hook this up with a pref observer and cache the value.

Any reason to check the pref and register and observer for every EventEmitter, rather than doing this at the top level?

While you're here, and if you feel like it, I think this would be clearer if we just did:

  if (!this.loggingEnabled) {
    return;
  }

Weird, getting an error on the toolkit/devtools unit tests `Services.prefs is undefined at resource://gre/modules/devtools/worker-loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/devtools/event-emitter.js:30`

Figured it out - apparently Services doesn't mean the same thing when isWorker is set

This does the trick (only reading the pref in the non isWorker case).  Try push: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=b0f8fd81a404
