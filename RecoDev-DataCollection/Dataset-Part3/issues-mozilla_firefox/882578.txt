fgTabBackgroundMiddle is used on Windows to set the -moz-dialog background differently in the middle part and the start and end parts of a tab (gradient vs solid color). Mac needs a gradient in the whole tab, so it can just fgTabTexture in all tab parts and set fgTabBackgroundMiddle to none.
The HiDPI override was missing fgTabTexture. The corresponding part in tabs.inc.css looks like this:

.tab-background-middle[selected=true] {
  background-color: transparent;
  background-image: url(chrome://browser/skin/tabbrowser/tab-active-middle.png),
                    @fgTabTexture@,
                    @fgTabBackgroundMiddle@;
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
  background-size: auto 100%;
}
