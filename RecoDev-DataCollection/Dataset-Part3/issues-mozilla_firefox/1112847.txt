Auto-connect today can trigger multiple connection attempts, as it gets triggered for every new runtime in the runtime list.

Looks good but I miss the precise connect scenario you are trying to avoid?

It's related to the auth I am building for WiFi in bug 1103120, sorry for not being more clear.

Prior to this patch, we'd call |connectToRuntime| as each runtime item is added.  So once you have one runtime that matches what was saved, we keep calling |connectToRuntime| for each runtime added.  So, you can get N calls to |connectToRuntime| when only one is needed if you have N available runtimes.

For the moment, it's probably not noticeable that we call |connectToRuntime| N times, as we'll just eventually use the last one.  But for WiFi authentication, I need to display a dialog in WebIDE when connecting, so N connections means N dialogs stacking on top of each other crazily.
