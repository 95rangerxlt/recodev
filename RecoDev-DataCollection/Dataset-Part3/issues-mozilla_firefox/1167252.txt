Tracking bugs that need uplift for 40.1

Tracking bugs that need uplift for 40.1
My steps for generating a commit list and coming up with an Aurora try build:

Copy and paste the Depends On list from this bug '(desc("Bug 1") | desc("Bug 2"))' etc.
Run that as a query with hg log --template 'http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-rev/{node}\n' -r 'sort(STRING, date)'

So for the current bug list, it looks something like this:

hg log --template 'http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-rev/{node}\n' -r 'sort((desc("Bug 1058898") | desc("Bug 1146239") | desc("Bug 1150761") | desc("Bug 1162662") | desc("Bug 1164552") | desc("Bug 1166494") | desc("Bug 1090950") | desc("Bug 1143004") | desc("Bug 1144034") | desc("Bug 1147693") | desc("Bug 1149626") | desc("Bug 1151973") | desc("Bug 1152631") | desc("Bug 1154115") | desc("Bug 1157916") | desc("Bug 1160313") | desc("Bug 1160521") | desc("Bug 1160691") | desc("Bug 1160696") | desc("Bug 1160811") | desc("Bug 1162583") | desc("Bug 1163384") | desc("Bug 1164130") | desc("Bug 1164131") | desc("Bug 1164281") | desc("Bug 1164338") | desc("Bug 1164593") | desc("Bug 1164598") | desc("Bug 1165045") | desc("Bug 1165504") | desc("Bug 1165885") | desc("Bug 1166029") | desc("Bug 1166122") | desc("Bug 1166124") | desc("Bug 1166139") | desc("Bug 1166559") | desc("Bug 1166823")), date)'

This prints a list like:

These can be qimported into an aurora repo.  Had to handle a couple of conflicts manually but things seemed to apply pretty cleanly.  Will see if that works alright and send a try push
Try push on aurora with that patch queue: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=ed5fcd147ed5

Dose hg skills tho.
Hi Lawrence,
We have a number of bugs for the DevTools performance tool that we need to get into 40.1 for the June 2 release.  I've tracked them down and marked them as blocking this bug.  It looks like maybe 40-50 changesets, basically the work that's been done on this tool since the last merge day (sorry).

It seems like it's going to be complicated and time consuming to go through and do aurora approval requests and pushes on each patch separately, since they need to land in a certain order to limit conflicts (ideally the order they landed on m-c).  I have a preliminary patch queue in this order on top of Aurora in Comment 2.  How would you recommend we proceed?
Over to Sylvestre, who is managing 40. See comment 4.

Looks like a big project! Could you share what kind of QA you have done on this?
Have all the bugs you want to uplift been verified?
Thanks

No, the bugs have not all been individually verified.  I believe that the developer evangelism team has been using the latest nightlies to test it out and make product videos of it for the 40.1 release (ccing Jeff and Axel who probably know more about that).

With regard to it being a big project - it is, although we are currently shipping this tool in Developer Edition (with a few things hidden).  We'd like to basically uplift the last 2 weeks of patches for this tool to bring it in sync with Nightly.  Maybe we could build a patch queue on top of Aurora and then send that build off for further testing?  Just let me know what I can do.
Could you flag some important bugs so that QE verifies it in nightly? Once it is done, we will be more confident for an uplift.

About the uplift itself, we will need to see the list of bugs, nominate every bug for uplift (I know it is a pain) and please fill the uplift form for every one (copy and paste is fine).

In the meantime, as you are proposing, having a patch with all the changes pushed to try would help.
> make product videos of it for the 40.1 release
Is it really a hard requirement for this "release"?
Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]: New devtool feature
[Suggested wording]: Performance tools in the developer tools
[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]: I guess we will have some blog posts.

Yes, it's the biggest part of the release

This is the biggest part of the release - this is a very hard requirement.

Nick and Gabriel just went through the entire blocking list here and flagged anything that could use verification with qe-verify+ and anything that doesn't need it with qe-verify-.
Try push with all patches from this bug list: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=8dda7b0945f6.  And the pushlog: https://hg.mozilla.org/try/pushloghtml?changeset=8dda7b0945f6
Looks like nothing can even build on try... :\

Added 3 more outstanding bugs to this blocker; up to you if they should be done with this changeset or in the future individually, in order of importance:

* bug 1050500 - will throw errors unless uplifted when selecting some markers
* bug 1167230 - (not yet finished) required for working with fennec/b2g, shu's on it
* bug 1152421 - many performance improvements with the waterfall view and marker folding

Let me know what else you need on my end!
Brian, it would be great if we could have the 40 try build working today and the uplift requests.
Thanks
I don't know if this helps yet, but I've updated my aurora repo and applied bgrin's pushlog patch series (comment 14) locally and built, everything went fine. 
So I'm now looking at the logs on that try build to see why it failed there.
All failures on that try push are mozharness related, after talking with Tomcat, I learned that RyanVM has pushed a change to mozharness no later than 2 hours ago: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-aurora&revision=7083715e204c
So we should definitely push this patch series to TRY again now, see if it works now with this change.
Unfortunately TRY is closed right now ...
It's not just TRY that's closed, aurora too, RyanVM told me he's working on it right now and has a potential fix.
Alright, apparently aurora tip should now work on try, and try has re-opened, so: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=d8eceb4500bd

Alright, Patrick has a try push in Comment 20 and I will do the uplift requests today
Try push with all platforms and tests: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=9fa5885856b7
Bug 1163384 is already on aurora, removing from list
Updated try push after adding the patch from bug 1050500 and removing the one from 1163384: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=e2174fa63e74
New try push (includes patch from Bug 1167230): https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=742a2dfce200
I've had verbal approval from Sylvestre to push the patches to aurora once we have a green try.  While that's running, I'm doing some extra testing.  Going to upload the current patch queue just for future reference
Created attachment 8611532
monster-patch-queue-aurora-40.1.zip

Current patch queue for bugs that have pending approval requests
Sylvestre, I've now pushed all of the requested patches: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-aurora&revision=b104a8b24b27
Sylvestre, luckily the hardest and most complicated part is done (thanks for the help btw), but I'd like to see if we could do one more round of uplifts before the release.

I've got a query for bugs that are blocking this one but haven't yet been fixed on 41: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=blocked&o1=equals&resolution=---&resolution=FIXED&resolution=INVALID&resolution=WONTFIX&resolution=DUPLICATE&resolution=WORKSFORME&resolution=INCOMPLETE&resolution=SUPPORT&resolution=EXPIRED&resolution=MOVED&o2=notequals&query_format=advanced&f2=cf_status_firefox40&v1=1167252&v2=fixed&list_id=12285787.

These are generally stability and polish items, and I've got an initial try push here: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=22eaf8e23b0b.  I will go through the list again to see if we can omit any of them.  Can we proceed with this?  Shall I go through and do uplift requests for the ones that we'd like  to go?  Ideally we could land them before or during the weekend so we don't have to try and land stuff immediately before the release.
Brian, that makes sense. However, we cannot take any risk now. Please submit only patches which has only super low risk (css only, this kind of change).
I understand you want it to be as perfect as possible but we cannot take the chance of important regressions on the Friday before the "release".
For example, I don't think bug 1168125 is necessary (ok, it might be a dependency of another bug)
(In reply to Sylvestre Ledru [:sylvestre] from comment #30)

All the patches are very low risk. Bug 1168125 is indeed only a dependency for an ulterior bug, and the only anomaly. Everything else is very well tested already and baked in fx-team.
(In reply to Sylvestre Ledru [:sylvestre] from comment #30)

With the risk of beating a dead horse, the current situation is no different than landing something on a "Friday before the uplift", when Nightly becomes Aurora. If we can do that without any hassle, then why would that be unreasonable now, given these special circumstances (having a 40.1 developer edition release)?

Nightly is proposed to our users with a message that it is unstable and for testing only.
Dev Edition is proposed to web dev now and we, release manager, don't have the same expectation in term of quality. Here, we merged 40 in aurora a couple weeks ago.
With the performance tools, the devtools team is asking to bypass the workflow and skip the train. Therefor, the level of expectation is not the same as in nightly... Especially with all the marketing planned for next week.
(In reply to Victor Porof [:vporof][:vp] from comment #32)
> landing something on a "Friday before the uplift", when Nightly becomes Aurora
We have a week between the merge and the aurora updates. During this period, QE is doing a lot of verifications, we do take patches and rebuild to have the first aurora in the best shape as possible.

Alright, I've done uplift requests for things that are low risk bug fixes and styling changes.  See Bug 1146237, Bug 1158982, Bug 1169132, and Bug 1147143.  Here's a try push on Aurora with those patches applied: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c6c6b85fe0da

Please have a look at the requests whenever you get a chance, we'd like to push any changes ASAP so they have time to bake in Aurora over the weekend if possible.
Brian's going to be out for a few days, so if there's any update here, let me know. Once approved, I can handle landing. Thanks for all your help in this, this release has been difficult for both devtools and release engineering, for sure
approved! thanks
Landed Bug 1146237, Bug 1158982, Bug 1169132, and Bug 1147143 on aurora. Not sure what flags on bugs need to be flipped, anything else on our end here? Thanks again!

For release notes, here are some blog posts:

https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/new-performance-tools-in-firefox-developer-edition-40/
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/power-surge-optimize-the-javascript-in-this-html5-game-using-firefox-developer-edition/

And a bunch of documentation (including tool usage docs and performance debugging scenarios):

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance
I think we can mark this bug as resolved at this point.  If we need to do any other uplifts they can be handled through the normal procedure on individual bugs.
This was added to the release notes of Firefox40. Updating the relnote-firefox flag to 40+.
