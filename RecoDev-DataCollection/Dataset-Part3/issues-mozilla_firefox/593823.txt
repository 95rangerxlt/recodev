We'll need to check with a hopefully representative range of Gtk themes whether tabs on top looks good enough to be the default state. The primary concern I have is that the menu bar is visually separated from the other toolbars and that the tabs would butt against this border, creating an uneasy appearance.

Dragging a tab button onto the personal tabs bar is less easy to me with tabs on top

on KDE 4.4

I can't quite compare to the brilliant array posted by Yan, but here's a screenshot of tabs on top on KDE 4.4 with the default Oxygen theme and QtCurve for used for GTK. It looks great, as do all the others posted above.

Some themes seem to do this on purpose and others don't. Even when they do, it doesn't look bad if that's what the theme was going for.

Everything I've seen thus far looks good and cross-platform consistency would be very good. I say flip the switch please. ;)

The inability to extend the menu bar color behind the tabs isn't ideal. It works really well in most cases though.
Requesting blocking beta7+ just to make sure this is on the radar, as a lot of Linux users have been complaining about the delay for this.
It doesn't block beta 7, and I don't think it blocks final either. I'll get the approval request evaluated.
Regardless of blocking then, is this on track for approval2.0+ before beta 7?
Status? Shouldn't this at least be able to land on Trunk for beta 8?
