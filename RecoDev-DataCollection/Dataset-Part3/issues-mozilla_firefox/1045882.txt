Seriously, everytime I have to use protocol.js I forget how it works and need to track down this random gist[0] because the actual protocol.js file doesn't really explain itself well to a reader who doesn't already get it.

Can we just put it as a .md file or big ass comment at the top of the file or something?

If I type 'gis' to the awesomebar it goes "What? You want to read the protocol.js docs *again*???". :)

Maybe we should put this on MDN and put lots of links to it in protocol.js?

We moved the Debugger API docs into the tree, and it has worked out great. Now when we update or change the debugger api, we can require docs with the patch and review them in our normal workflow. Plus we always know that the docs are up to date with the version of firefox we are working with.

I think we should leverage those benefits here as well.
