akhodakivskiy, are you the developer of VimFx? This add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

Shortcuts still do nothing for me on 2014-11-09-03-02-05-mozilla-central-firefox-36.0a1.ru.linux-x86_64.

*Some* shortcuts, like "d", but not "f" (though it's slow).  The "Keyboard shortcuts" menu item just toggles the icon.
The developer has been notified through AMO.
This appears to be fixed.
Using 43.0a2 (2015-10-02), some key bindings don't work, e.g.: up/down using JK.
There's also a delay when pressing F.

Can someone else please replicate?
VimFx 0.6.0 has now been released, which is fully multi-process compatible.
