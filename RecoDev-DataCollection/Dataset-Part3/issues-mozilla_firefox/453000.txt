ON a MAC I use control + or - to make font larger or smaller.  in the old firefox, the font stayed in the size I chose until a new positive keyboard command.  now, the font changes itself back to the default of a new window after I have changed URL's a few times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open web browser or new tab
2.change font size of the tab-usually larger with control + is my choice
3.after I browse to a few other URL's within that tab, the font will suddenly go back to the default. 
Actual Results:  
the font restores itself to default.  IF I enlarge again, after a few URL changes, it reverts to the default again.  

Expected Results:  
Font should stay (and did in the previous version) in the new font size until I positively enter a keyboard command to make larger or smaller.

With previous version you mean Firefox 2.0.0.x?

With Firefox 3, zoom level is kept on a site-specific basis

Yes, I mean 2.0.0.x.  Am I reading this correctly, this is intended?  If so, I am going to have to give some serious thought to using another browser, this is not acceptable.
Have you tried to set that key in about:config to false? It should work like you ask.
