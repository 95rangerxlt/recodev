No, no error in error console.
But, if it was occurred, snippets is also missing.


I think this is rare case. So, I withdraw tracking request until I find another web sites.
This http://html5demos.com/offlineapp page also affected:

Reproducible: often

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open http://html5demos.com/offlineapp
(2. Click "Allow" button if door hanger was popped up for Aurora25.0a2 and earlier)

3. Exit Browser From Menu Alt > F > X or Alt+F4
4. Restart Browser
   --- observe "Restore Previous Session" button

5. Click "Restore Previous Session" button if the button was available
6. Repeat from step3

Actual Results:
"Restore Previous Session" button in about:home is missing at step4 sometimes.
Curiously, "Restore Previous Session" is available in History menu and in another opened about:home.

These affected web site use offline storage. 
So, something of offline storage-related seems to be broken.
I can reproduce that bug on MacOS X. Doesn't seem to be specific to the web site, though: I have the same behavior with http://example.net .
From what I understand, this means that something has sent message "browser:purge-session-history". Investigating further.
Investigating further, this seems to indicate that Sanitizer.history.clear has been called.
OS.File logging indicates that the session restore file has been loaded properly.

Confirmed.
And I got same regression range of comment#1 and  comment#2.

1. Open http://example.net and wait to complete loading the page
2. Exit Browser
3. Restart Browser

5. Repeat from Step2, (It may be necessary to repeat the considerable number of times)

Actual Results:

I've spent a few hours attempting to find out what's going on.
So far, my best guess is that, for some reason, AboutHome.jsm is not loaded/initialized. I have no idea why, though.
Got it. I believe that the issue is actually totally unrelated to OS.File, but has been attributed to the OS.File refactoring because it is non-deterministic.

In AboutHome.jsm, |AboutHome.receiveMessage| accesses |SessionStore.canRestoreLastSession| without waiting for Session Restore to be initialized. This causes a race condition between Session Restore initialization and about:home initialization.

ubernit: can you add a colon? helps distinguish the log message from the exception text.

Test fix?

David, I could not locally reproduce the test failure that was happening on that try push. Maybe it's because I'm testing with a debug build, and the debug spew slow it enough to always have the about:home page updated before the test checks run.
In any case, I wrote a function that should wait on the proper conditions before starting the test. Can you check if it fixes the prob for you? If it doesn't hopefully it's not too far and it's a good hint on how it can be fixed.

(The function always enter in the "already updated" branch for me)
Try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=1f8ff3f35f24
new try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=089d5b13f878
(loadFrameScript didn't like the \n in the data url)
From that try run, the testcase where the code was added worked properly now, but a later testcase is seem failing now, so it probably needs the same fix.

It's strange because the main function guiding the testcases already has a mutation observer that waits for the proper properties to be set. I don't know why that wait is not enough.
I looked into the test failure since I'm able to reproduce it with pretty high probability.

The basic problem is as follows. The test wants us to load the snippets using the URL "nonexistent://test", which is supposed to cause the XHR to fail so that we load default snippets instead. However, the code that sets the snippets URL to "nonexistent://test" happens well after we would initiate the XHR in loadSnippets. Most of the time this seems to work because some other code sets the snippets-last-update value to the current time. However, there are cases where that code also runs too late.

I think this may have always been possible, it was just unlikely. I'll post a patch tomorrow. I'll try to reduce the crazy number of ordering dependencies as well.

Canceling f? while waiting for billm's patch.

abouthome-test.fix

This patch changes how the tests are run for about:home. A major problem with the current code is that it tries to hook into about:home in a way that just doesn't seem valid to me. If it wants to run some code before a function F in aboutHome.js runs, and it knows that F is triggered by an event E, then it registers its own event handler for E and runs the code then. However, there's no guarantee that its code will run before F--it might run after.

I've tried to solve this problem by introducing some custom events that aboutHome.js triggers. These events allow the about:home tests to hook in at exactly the right time. There's one event that triggers after the snippets map has been loaded from disk but before it's used to actually display the snippets. There's another event that runs after about:home is finished loading.

The "Load" name alone implies too much to me that it's just the page loading, rather than it waiting to do something. I suggest we change the function to "promiseLoadSnippetsSucceeded" and the event name to "AboutHomeLoadSnippetsSucceeded"

I fixed those problems and did some further work to ensure that event handlers are always installed before the event could possibly happen.
I did a try run here, but it probably makes sense for David to land these patches. I think we're ready to go.

patch for beta

I backported David's fix to beta. Getting Felipe's review since we're now waiting in a different part of the code (since the about:home refactoring hadn't landed on beta).

I'm not seeing the test failures on beta that we saw on trunk, at least not locally. Assuming that the tests pass on try, there's no need to backport the test changes. Here's the try push:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=98c2c38deffd
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/e67ff293405d
Could someone who can reproduce Alice's original STR check to see if it's fixed on beta now?
I couldn't reproduce the issue on Firefox 25 buggy builds on Ubuntu 13.04 32bit and Mac OS X 10.7.5 64bit even after restarting Firefox the 20-something-th time.

It did reproduce quite easily on Windows 7 64bit though, so I verified it there on:
