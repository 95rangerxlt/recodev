Shouldn't have landed with DONTBUILD, as it was a code change.

Yep, generally, you shouldn't do that. Initial blame would be on the subsequent changeset for any unforeseen consequences of your push.
Also, r=me doesn't make sense, but I guess that's a matter of taste. It's just as good as no review but seems less upfront.

Ok, sorry, I'll keep that in mind.

True, this was in fact just copied behavior from someone else who I thought did it right...
