It's been a long time headache for me that whenever I'm using VPN, I have to manually switch the Network Settings to Manual Proxy Configuration. The Auto-detect proxy settings for this network option will not work even though I close all FireFox instances and re-launch again.

I.E. however doesn't have this kind of issue. What I need to do is just close all ie instances and re-launch.

Can FireFox development team take this into consideration in the future releases please to let FireFox REALLY AUTO-DETECT proxy setting that doesn't force users to manually swap back and forth from the Manual Proxy Configuration option and the Auto-detect proxy settings for this network option???

Thanks very much.

I have the same problem and I need to be connected to our company's VPN frequently and browse the  net at the same time but can't 

This is very annoying.
Yahoo!!!! the bug got fixed!!! with version 2.0.0.12!!!! 

i will just need to select the "Automatic proxy configuration URL" and provide the URL and no matter using VPN or not, i don't have to manually swap every time now.

Thanks for making FireFox more robust.
