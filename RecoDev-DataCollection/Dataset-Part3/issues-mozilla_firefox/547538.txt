This patch is on top of the patches in bug 482086 and bug 482105.

I've profiled window painting with those patches and found out that rendering the borders was the largest performance problem. So this patch gets rid of the borders: The textbox gets a dark background and 1px padding, and the things inside the textbox get a white background that overlays the dark background of the textbox.
I've also replaced the gradient images with real gradients and got rid of all shadow blurring except for the focus ring and the pressed states.

I've introduced one small visual change: The textboxes' inner shadow is a little less opaque. This matches the new mockups.

Tryserver perf numbers look good.

I'll create a separate bug for the Gecko border drawing slowness.

feel free to land my two patches together with this
Perhaps some comments surrounding the css detailing why this is absolutely necessary to stay like that until bug XXX is landed for perf reasons?

Yeah, I'll add them when I've filed the bug.
OK, looks like there still is a 1% Txul regression (from 253.5ms to 255ms)...
I'll expect that to go away after the tab bar restyle.

Shark says that drawing the tab borders is much more worthy of optimization than drawing the location and search bar.
So apparently the real problem was that we weren't resetting -moz-border-*-colors and thus suffering from bug 547591. I should have applied the patch from bug 482692 before profiling...
Tomorrow I'll test whether that makes using borders viable.
