The current file is completely missing localization comments and has at least 2 strings with problems.

validator.invalidManifestJSON=The webapp manifest isn't a valid JSON file: %1$S at: %2$S

If I read the code right, variable should be swapped (%1$S is the url, %2$S the error message).

validator.missIconForMarketplace=app submission to the Marketplace needs at least an 128 icon

"an 128 icon" doesn't sound right to me, I guess adding pixel would make sense too.
