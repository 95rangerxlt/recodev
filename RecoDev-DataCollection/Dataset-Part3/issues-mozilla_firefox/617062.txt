I pushed what should have been a simple fix last week (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ef0adaaa2e53) but it went all orange. Specifically test_cascade didn't seem to like this - the counts for tab state were off by 1.

I'll look into it sometime soon, but I don't think this indicates anything wrong with code, just poor test construction.
