Image showing the issue.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110805 Firefox/8.0a1
Build ID: 20110805030744

Steps to reproduce:

Went to about:permissions, typed a domain for which I had Basic Auth credentials saved into the 'Search Sites' box.


Actual results:

Under the Store Passwords section, it says '0 passwords are stored for this web site.' and the Manage Passwords... button is disabled.


Expected results:

Should display how many passwords I have, and enable the Manage Passwords... button.

I can clear the 'Search Sites' box (so I am just looking at All Sites) and click on the Manage Passwords... button.  Then search for the domain that I have the saved Basic Auth credentials, and it shows my saved passwords for that domain.

findLogins should ignore httpScheme

Summary of Changes
- Changed last parameter of findLogins from null to "". When it's null, it won't match anything with a login scheme (e.g. Mozilla LDAP) where as "" will freely match against anything.

findLogins should ignore httpScheme

This makes sense to me, but Dolske would better understand the implications of this change, since he's more familiar with the login manager code.

I also think you should leave that comment in there, since it still won't find logins that could be stored with different URIs from that host.

Seems fine to me.
