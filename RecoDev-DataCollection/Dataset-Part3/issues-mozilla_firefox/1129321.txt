let blocks are a nonstandard SpiderMonkey feature we would like to remove (in bug 1023609). This patch removes the let blocks in the browser/ subtree.

The attached patch excludes whitespace changes because most of the patch is unindenting blocks of unchanged code from the removed let blocks. This made the important bits of the patch harder to review.

r=me with the indentation of all the blocks fixed that now aren't blocks anymore. That basically affects all of the files :)

That indentation doesn't look right. Can you please add curly braces while you're at it?
Thanks. I fixed the indentation and added curly braces.
