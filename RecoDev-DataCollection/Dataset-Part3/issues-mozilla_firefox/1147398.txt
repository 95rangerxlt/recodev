There are lots of places in nsBrowserGlue.js that call Services.strings.createBundle("chrome://branding/locale/brand.properties") or Services.strings.createBundle("chrome://browser/locale/browser.properties").

This should be refactored to instead use a lazy getter for each at the top of the file.

Here is a list of each of the current references:

Hey!
I'm ready to take this up.

If I understand it right, I need to make two global variables: 'brandBundle' & 'browserBundle'  
defined as null at the beginning, and at every reference throughout the file, I'll simply call createBundle in case the required variable is null.

Something like this : 

> brandBundle = brandBundle || Services.strings.createBundle("chrome://branding/locale/brand.properties");
> browserBundle = browserBundle || Services.strings.createBundle("chrome://branding/locale/browser.properties");

Is that right ?

Not quite. You basically want to add something along the lines of:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/nsBrowserGlue.js#132

132 XPCOMUtils.defineLazyGetter(this, "ShellService", function() {
133   try {
134     return Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/shell-service;1"].
135            getService(Ci.nsIShellService);
136   }
137   catch(ex) {
138     return null;
139   }
140 });

Except instead of "ShellService" it should be "gBrandBundle" and "gBrowserBundle", respectively, and the functions that you pass as the third argument should return the stringbundle (Services.strings...).

Then you should update the reference sites to reference gBrand/gBrowserBundle instead. They shouldn't need to create them themselves.
if @bogas04 is not working on it now, I would like to work on it.

It seems bogas is working on bug 1139026, so maybe Kartik can work on this one.

Kartik, can you format your patch to include a commit message ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#Commit_Message_Conventions )?

Then I have some comments on the patch content. When you've addressed all of these, please attach a new patch and set the "review" field to "?", and put ":Gijs" in the textfield that appears, and you should be able to get me to review the patch.

Please create a temporary variable for the URL and pass that as the argument. Whatever you do, don't split up the actual string with the URL that you're passing here across multiple lines. Now there's whitespace in the URL - I'd be surprised if it worked. Did you test this change? How?

"Please create a temporary variable for the URL and pass that as the argument"

Gijs, I saw other lazy getters were using the string directly. So using a variable is optional or do I have to do it?

Also, i tested by building and checking whether the browser was starting up. Any specific test case(s) that I should test?
I have the patch ready, need the previous queries to be answered before submitting, or should I just submitting the patch?

I mean, either you should wrap the call correctly, or use a temp variable. I don't mind much which you prefer.

Just submitting the patch is fine, we can continue to iterate if more changes are necessary.

This looks OK, I just have some whitespace nits. Can you upload the new version and finalize the commit's comment to have "r=gijs" at the end, and request another review so I see it and can run tests on it before landing it? Thanks!

> What is to be done from my end now?

We wait for the try push to finish and see if there are any failing tests that indicate an issue with the patch. If not, I'll add the checkin-needed keyword or land the patch myself. So there's not much to do on your end for the moment. If the tests do fail, we'll need to figure out how you can fix the patch so it doesn't cause issues. :-)
