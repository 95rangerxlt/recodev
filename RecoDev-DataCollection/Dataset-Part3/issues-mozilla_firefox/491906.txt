In Preferences/Advanced/Update, I clicked on 'Automatically download and install the update'.  That option and the rest of the 'When updates to Firefox are found' section was greyed out immediately, preventing me from unchecking that option.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Click on 'Automatically download and install the update'
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Greyed-out section

Expected Results:  
No greying out of anything.

I just created the user account (guest), and started firefox for the first time under this account, so this should be easy to reproduce.  I've installed adblock plus as the only plugin.

Could you try to reproduce?
It's only when "Ask me what to do" is selected that the "When updates to Firefox
are found" section should be grayed out.

Window from firefox's preferences showing greyed out sections.

I don't know what settings I have to modify to reset this dialog box, but I've upgraded to Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091216 Fedora/3.5.6-1.fc11 Firefox/3.5.6, and it's still greyed out.

I need to create another account in order to test.
Now I understand.
It's because the package/update manager from your Linux distribution has disabled the Firefox auto update feature.

Marking as INVALID, because your distribution disabled those menus.

Screen shot from virgin run of Firefox on brand-spanking new account

While I'd love to say you've solved the mystery, I can't.  My distribution hasn't disabled those menus.  I finally sat down and created a fresh account to test this with; please see the attachments.

After clicking 'firefox updates'

You can see that the 'firefox updates' checkbox is now grey, preventing me from turning OFF updates.  Not the behaviour you'd expect.
So, in attachment 423299, firefox is not checked, but the 'when updates to firefox are found' section is not grey.

In attachment 423300, firefox is checked, and turns *itself* grey, plus the question "Warn me if this will disable any of my add-ons", for some reason.

Aha.  I found the problem: this version of Firefox is old (3.0.15).

After trying this with a new account on my laptop (FF 3.5.6), the problem is gone: the firefox button is grey, as is the "when updates are found" section.
