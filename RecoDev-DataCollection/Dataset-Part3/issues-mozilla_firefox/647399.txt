If firefox is launched when no network connection is available, and later if I connect to a network, Live bookmarks fail to load until firefox is restarted

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure no network connections are available
2. Launch firefox
3. Connect to a network
4. Check your live bookmarks
Actual Results:  
In the drop down, you would see 'Live bookmark feed failed to load'. Try to refresh. Still it shows the same error

Expected Results:  
Live book mark refresh should happen successfully

None

Forgot to mention one point. Normal browsing happens fine. No problems there. It's just that Live bookmarks do not refresh. If i click on existing stale entries of the live feed, it connects fine.
Bug 410101 related?
I suspect here the problem is not that the feed fail to load, but that we were not removing the "Live bookmark feed failed to load" message correctly.
bug 663104 should have taken care of that.
