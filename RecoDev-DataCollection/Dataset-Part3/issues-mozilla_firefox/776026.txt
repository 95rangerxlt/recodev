Is there a public URL or testcase ?
Do you mean the new, integrated PDF viewer ?
Does it work if you disable the integrated PDF viewer and download the pdf or use a plugin ?
Yes I mean the new integrated PDF viewer

Yes there is a public URL :
http://www.officiel-presse.com/site2011/pdf/acces_libre.php?pub=fmr&departement=75

When I switch PDF handle form the integrated PDF viewer, to Okular (Linux PDF viewer) it works fine (download and launch app).
The url that is provided above in comment 2 works with the latest FF17. The channel (cookie) state was fixed by bug 784718.
