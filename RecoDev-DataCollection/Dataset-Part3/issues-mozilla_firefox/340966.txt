regressed from Bug 333734
*** Bug 340993 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
accepting, I have a patch for the trunk that fixes this and also warns (under the proper circumstances) for the additional scenario that I forgot when I "fixed" bug #333734, which is selecting multiple items in the places UI and then doing open in tabs.

r=ben@mozilla.org, 

although it'd be nice to rename "tabsToOpen" to something that included the word "count" or "number" since it's not immediately obvious from a quick scan that it isn't an array or something like that.

the correct patch
ben, here's the issue additional change addresses.  the existing code ensured the container was open in order to get the count and to get all uri's in the container.  when I added the prompt though, the user would now notice that the container was open (if it wasn't open before.)

so I added code to restore the original state before we prompt, and then restore the state to open after we prompt.

the code to restore the original state at the very end is still there.

      // Open each uri in the folder in a tab.
      var index = firstIndex;
      asFolder(node);
      var wasOpen = node.containerOpen;
      node.containerOpen = true;
      var cc = node.childCount;

+     // restore the original state (temporarily) so that if we prompt
+     // the user, the will not see a change to the open state.
+     node.containerOpen = wasOpen;
      if (!this._confirmOpenTabs(cc))
         return;
+     // ensure the container is open, we'll restore it again
+     // to the original state when we are done
+     node.containerOpen = true;


      for (var i = 0; i < cc; ++i) {
        var childNode = node.getChild(i);
        if (this.nodeIsURI(childNode)) {
          // If there are tabs to load over, load the uri into the next tab.
          if (index < tabCount)
            tabPanels[index].loadURI(childNode.uri);
          // Otherwise, create a new tab to load the uri into.
          else
            browser.addTab(childNode.uri);
          ++index;
        }
      }
      node.containerOpen = wasOpen;

A message appears in the error console after the error:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Cannot modify properties of a

I hope this helps.
I can reproduce with trunk/Linux.

is this set to wasOpen later in the function? The patch doesn't show...
