Alex, are you interested in this bug ?

And Brian, can I mentor this bug ? I'm not a peer, but I did work on lots of theme bugs already.

Sure, you can mentor it - I will do a final review before landing

Hi Tim, yes I am interested in this. I'll review your initial comments and see what questions I have.
Am I correct in understanding that I should only be worrying about removing references to the .png from within /browser/themes/shared/devtools/ as the cross-reference search indicates?

If so, I will need to remove all instances that show up in those search results, except for the one in /browser/themes/shared/devtools/debugger.inc.css, which is removed in bug 1009145.

Bug 973691 removes it from /browser/devtools/sourceeditor/codemirror/mozilla.css, which is outside of the theme folders I am working in.

Yes, you'll also need to remove the references in the jar.mn files (browser/themes/(linux|osx|windows)/jar.mn).
Ok, great. Thanks Tim.
Adding dependency to bug 1009145 as it'll cause patch conflicts if bug 1009145 lands first or vice versa.

Patch for bug 1011173

Here is my initial attempt at this patch. A few issues came up during the course of making the changes. I made my best guess as to proper course of action, but please correct me if I am wrong.

1. In instances where the background image was the only css property in that particular class, i removed the entire class reference.
2. I left alone all other properties in each class. A majority of these are text colors, which I am assuming should be the same despite the different background.
3. I removed the entire "background" property each time the image was included, although I am now thinking I should have only removed the url(...), and left the  color. Perhaps changing the property to background-color.

Ok, those are the only issues I can recall.

This is going in the right direction. But it causes some regressions though.

For the properties like : background: url(background-noise-toolbar.png), <COLOR>;
I would change them into : background-color: <color>;

Also, can you rebase your patch on top of bug 1009145 ? Otherwise, there will be patch conflicts.

For this property, you might just want to use :
background-color: #343C45;

Our goal is to flat-out the DevTools UI, so, we should get rid of the linear-gradient()
Hi Tim,

Ok. I think I understand what changes need to be made to my changes. I deleted the old patch from my queue and am starting a new one. I did `hg pull` and `hg update` thinking that would include the changes from 1009145, but when i search the log with `hg log -r 1009145` it says it is unknown. Is there a way to rebase on top of a patch that hasn't been committed yet?

In this case you would want to do `hg log -r 79d74ac58388`, where the the ID is coming from: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009145#c28

You can also import patches as shown in this video : http://codefirefox.com/video/import-patch
Note that bug 1009145 is now in mozilla-central, so you should have less trouble now.

Patch for bug 1011173

Here is another attempt at this patch. I fixed the CSS as discussed in the thread. The only thing I wasn't sure of was whether to use the `background` or `background-color` property for cases where the only was color was RGBA(). I went with `background-color`. I've seen it done both ways, and I think it renders the same either way. 

I also deleted the actual .png in this patch, which I think I omitted from the previous. 

Also, I believe I correctly rebased this, so it should merge correctly, but let me know if there are further issues.

Ok, this patch adds the missing Toolbar css comments, and should resolve the merge conflict.

There are rejects on the jar.mn files - can you pull latest changes and resubmit the patch?  Also please add r=bgrins in the commit message
Alex, you might want to check here : http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/log/tip/browser/themes/windows/jar.mn

for possible conflicting bugs. Some are not on mozilla-central, but you can either wait, or manually import the patch from the bug.
Tim, I assume those are patches that are waiting to be checked in to mozilla central from fx-team? Is there an easy way to determine which might be conflicting, or does it just involve combing through them?

Yes, they are first checked-in to fx-team or mozilla-inbound, and then they are pushed to mozilla-central.

Well, there's no real easy way, you'll need to check the latest patches landing, and see which patch has changes at similar places, and import that patch.

I don't think you should generally have too many issues with this.  It is mainly an issue on files that change a lot, like the jar.mn files, or if the bug depends on another that just got resolved.  I think for this bug it would be safe to just pull the latest changes and qref the patch.
