I have used Firefox to access my company's web-based e-mail since 0.9. Although
it was a little unreliable back then, it eventually improved starting Firefox
1.0. Since then I have never used my IE. Well, that was until I upgraded to 1.0.3.

I am still able to access my company's web-based e-mail but I am unable to open
any of my messages. Just selecting a message by clicking on it already produces
a javascript application error. I thought at first that there was a problem with
our mail server so I used that IE to access my mail. Imagine my disappointment
when it worked! So now, I'm stucked again with IE to access my company e-mail!

I have confirmed the same thing happening with my colleague. He was unable to
open his messages as well with the same error happening.

Dear Sir,
When I visit this web site http://tvcity.tvb.com/drama/just_love/sense/index.html
I click on some of the items below that page, a small blank windows pop up, the
status bar in the bottom of that small windows keep running "Transfering data
from...." "connecting...." ,  it keeps switching.
If I use internet explore, I have no problem. Hopefully you can fix it, thanks!
Already working in Firefox 1.0.4.
