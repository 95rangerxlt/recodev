So is this test no longer breaking for you? :-)
Yes, it passes on latest mozilla-central (clean repo - yey!) and fails on an older version (mozilla-central-5376a2ce7b29).

I actually think

document.createElement("toolbar");

will work just fine, but please doublecheck that.

This isn't a navBar, that's the toolbar with id = 'nav-bar';

innerHTML is evil, especially in XUL. Please use:

is(gNavToolbox.getElementsByAttribute("id", kToolbar).length, 1, ...)

instead.

There are some failures but I don't think they are caused by this test:
