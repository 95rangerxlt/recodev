PDF that Firefox fails to render

Firefox (PDF.js) is failing to render the PDF that is linked in this bug. All I see when I try to view it via the browser is this: http://i.imgur.com/U0Egu.png. When I view the Error Console, I see this: 

Timestamp: 4/3/2012 9:06:30 PM
Error: The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must to be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.

I've attached the actual PDF file to this bug as well, it renders fine in a 3rd party program like SumatraPDF.

Windows 7 Pro x64, Firefox 14a1 4/3 Nightly Build (Built from http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/c410b2d6d570).
