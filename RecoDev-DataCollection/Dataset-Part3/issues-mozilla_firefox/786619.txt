Rare screenshot that I captured luckily.

I was playing around with the dev tools and suddenly I found that the infobar has reappeared even in the 3D mode and is not disappearing (except when hovering over style sidebar).

I was able to reproduce it only once thereafter.

It has something to do with the new markup panel (or maybe not). The common things that I did in both the tries was open and close the markup panel once, have Responsive mode on, along with the 3D view.

STR:

13:25 < victorporof> open inspector
13:25 < victorporof> open tilt
13:25 < victorporof> switch to a different tab
13:25 < victorporof> switch back
13:26 < victorporof> you'll see what happens.
I think this has been fixed by bug 785910 or bug 787952 (can't reproduce when patches applied).

I'll ask you to re-test once those 2 bugs have landed.
Landed in fx-team. Can someone confirm this is fixed?

Not fixed. I was able to reproduce with the same steps in comment #1.
To reproduce, the sidebar needs to be open apparently.

`show` is now being called by other components, so we can't trust `hide`.
And when we are recreating the highlighter, we were putting it on top of the canvas.

This should work.
