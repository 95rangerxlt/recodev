We set the windows talkback install percent to 100% for the deerpark alpha
releases, and this needs to be bumped back down for the final release cycle.

I'd like to only crank this down for release branches, unless we're expecting
something off the trunk to get a large amount of testing.
Chris, I bumped this back down to 20% per Chase due to the installer-reversing
scare. Should we leave this at 20% now until the release, or do you want the
beta to have 100%.
I think we need to bring it back down to 20% for any major releases.  Just from
looking at the Talkback servers the past few weeks, we are barely handling the
data of for 1.0.4 and 1.0.5 (we have a constant backlog during the day)...so I
don't think we can currently handle 100% of any release that is going to attract
millions of users.
This got backed-down to 20% due to miscommunication, so closing as fixed.
