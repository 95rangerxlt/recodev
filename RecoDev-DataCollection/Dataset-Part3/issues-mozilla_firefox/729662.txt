I don't know if is firefox bug or Tile Tabs bug
Works for me on
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2

Are you sure these are the only steps you need in order to reproduce? Do you have other add-ons installed? Have you tried contacting the developer for support?
Only happens with the addon installed, but don't happen always, is aleatory.
Have relatively long time without happens (I have firefox 11 now)...
(I am repurposing this old bug report to track a new e10s-specific bug with Tile Tabs with the same description.)

In bug 1108692, Mr_KrzYch00 reported that Tiles Tabs version 11.13 makes every tab blank when e10s is enabled (in Nightly 37). Firefox logs the following error message  in the Browser Console:

> TypeError: tab.linkedBrowser.docShell is null. tiletabs-browser.js:1462:46
All that I wanted to say was already said in bug 1108692. I can only add than today update of Nightly still makes tile tabs/tile view incompatible. I also notified the author about the issue, now it's time to wait for one of parties to do the fixing. If I really need the add-on I will just rollback nightly to the update from few weeks ago.
According to author of Tile Tabs the problem was because:

"[...]Firefox Nightly, which creates a hidden browser preloaded with the “newtab” page.  This allows the “newtab” page to be displayed really quickly when the “Open new tab” button is clicked.  This hidden browser is interfering with the operation of Tile Tabs[...]"
I have fixed this problem in Tile Tabs 12.0 alpha 10, which is currently being used (tested) by  Mr_KrzYch00.
Version 12.9 is available on AMO. Is this problem fixed?
This problem was fixed in Tile Tabs 12.0 released on 2014-12-24.  There have been no similar problems reported since then.  This bug can be closed.
Awesome, thanks.
