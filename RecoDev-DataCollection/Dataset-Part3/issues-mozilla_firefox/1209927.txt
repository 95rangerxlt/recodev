Build ID: 20150929102827

Steps to reproduce:

Install the addon SiteDelta (http://sitedelta.schierla.de/beta.de.php). Firefox Nightly crashes upon startup. I realize this is Addon related, but since there was no addon change in the last year, but a Firefox update seems to have caused the issue, I thought someone might look into this.


Actual results:

Firefox crashes after 1-2 seconds from start up


Expected results:

Firefox should not crash.

Merely installing the extension wasn't enough to cause a crash. The crash occurred when the add-on checked for page updates. E10s status made no difference.
Hi there,

the latest is:
bp-8dd4d123-768b-45f9-91ae-54de32150930.txt
but I submitted one on every crash, let me know if you need more. I can also post the settings of SiteDelta if needed.

Cheers,
Stefan
Thank you for the update. There's no need for additional crash reports.

It looks like this will be addressed by bug 1208755: the crash signature is the same, and the cause of the regression is identified as bug 1184798, which is in the regression range at comment 1.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
20151002030204

I can no longer reproduce this after the patch in bug 1208755 landed.
