The keyboard shortcut for opening Download Manager in Firefox 0.9 is Ctrl + Y. 
But the same is referred as Ctrl + E in the online documentation and Help
Manual.  I believe earlier it was Ctrl + E.  This may be corrected.  Now the
menu item for downloads also refer to Ctrl + Y as the shortcut.

Confirming. I'll fix this soon.
Fix checked in on Firefox Help Trunk and on the primary Firefox trunk.

I don't think aviary branch is used anymore, but if I'm wrong, post a comment
and i'll fix it on that branch.

yes, we're still using aviary branch

1.0 will ship from the aviary branch (and any subsequent 1.x releases) so we'll
be checking in on branch and trunk for a considerable amount of time yet.
Fix checked in on the aviary branch. Thanks for that info, mconnor! I wasn't
sure if we're using it for 0.9 or through 1.0.
