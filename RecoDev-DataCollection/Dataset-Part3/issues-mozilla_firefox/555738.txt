On some of the news ('nieuws') pages of the website above, Firefox immediatly quites when clicking on a link that navigates to a new page (on or offsite). The same happens when closing the tab.

The quiting is really unexpected: No dialog, No message, nothing. 

When firefox is restarted it starts either by opening all the tabs as they were or saying 'oops that was embarassing...etc. etc.'. 

After firefox has started and the page is loaded, the process may repeat when doing the same as above. 

The only way to navigate away from the site is to let FireFox quit until it asks which pages to re-open and then uncheck the tweakers page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Note: It does not happen with every page of the site mentioned below, nor does it happen only on that site. See 'additional information' for my suspicions...

1. Open the page http://tweakers.net/nieuws/list/1269558000
2. Then either close the tab or click a link that will move to another page on the same site or another site.
3. Poof, FireFox quits. 


Actual Results:  
Firefox quits and must be restarted (if one wishes to continue browsing the web)

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not have quited on me, but rather display the other page of which i clicked the link. (Alternatively it should have closed the tab and leave all others open)

Alternatively alternatively I would like Firefox to elegantly report on the problem en let me continue browsing / just close the tab.

I use no themes or personas.
I think it has to do with the presence of video content on that page. Maybe a certain type embeded player that is problematic.


If i was editing some wiki in another tab i would have lost data -> Critical
Browsing is the core functionality of FireFox, so i would say a major feature is broken -> Critical.

The bug seems to have gone after upgrading to 3.6.3.
