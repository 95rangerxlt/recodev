This came out of discussion in bug 937586.

Open the network monitor and then visit
https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/logo_sprite.7d36c4a1422b.svg

Notice that the svg doesn't display as a thumbnail.
Now copy the svg as a data: URL.

I get (truncated for your sanity):
data:image/svg+xml;undefined,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" ...

That "undefined" comes from:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/shared/webconsole/network-monitor.js#385

The thumbnail code should probably base64-encode this itself when the
encoding is not set.
