I just realized that bug 860562 broke the transition where the subview comes in from the side. This is because I overzealously added a rule that sets display: none; on the subview when its not displaying. When the panel is set to view a subview, an attribute is set, and the display:none doesn`t apply, and the animation should occur.

Unfortunately, it seems that display: none; somehow overrides the animation from occurring - I guess before it`s removed. So the animation never happens, and the element just snaps to its final destination.
