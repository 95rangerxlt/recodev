bug 658618 and bug 697941 were create in order to expose about:permissions.

I just accidentally set on a page to 'never' all fullscreen for videos instead of 'always'. This setting is handled via about:permissions and it was a pain in the butt to find. If now even this UI gets removed where would this being set afterwards?

Would that be handled via 'Identity panel'? see bug 909326
There are definitely people who use it.  Depend on it might be too strong a word, but it fills part of a yawning gap.  My own addon would break, in a small way, if it was completely removed.

Note that a single-domain version of about:permissions appears in a tab of the page info dialog.
This should be WONTFIX. Having centralized permission management is absolutely critical as we move the web to an OS-like model.

I think we should strongly consider merging about:permissions into about:preferences.

Hidden gem, thanks! Unfortunately, it doesn't cover iframes, which means using it to e.g. control camera access for https://jsfiddle.net/srn9db4h/ doesn't work.

Now, explain me now HOW you:
- set the default permissions for all websites? (and disable sound by default like explained in bug 1193191 ?)
- see what sites don't have default permissions?
Typing about:permissions in the location bar and hitting enter does nothing instead of redirecting to the "address not found" page.

Fix comment #9.
This bug needs to be reopened to have the follow-up patch pushed.

Some of the permissions can still be globally disabled from about:preferences UI (like cookies and passwords). The others can all be disabled from about:config. We can consider adding UI for the ones not already exposed, although I not sure it's generally useful.

(Actually, I don't know if there are about:config entries for the camera/mic, but the about:permissions UI/code didn't actually let you globally disable those anyway. Ironically, these are the ones I'd expect to be of more privacy interest, and so it really just shows how bad about:permissions was at its job.)


> - see what sites don't have default permissions?

From https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/2015-November/003521.html:

===
If we think there are compelling use-cases for management of specific
permissions (that are not met with existing UI, like the Control Center or
various stuff in about:preferences), we could consider adding some
per-permission UI as was done in bug 1201398. But I don't feel the general
about:permissions use-case is compelling enough that we should block
removal on a total/unified successor.
===

I'll note that this is also an example of how bad about:permissions is at its task... Cookies are allowed by default (and most users leave them so), and thus the about:permissions list quickly clutters up with every site you've visited because nearly every site sets cookies. That makes it very difficult to use about:permissions to find sites with non-default permissions.

(Not to mention that default / non-default settings are visually identical, so it's hard to click a site in about:permissions and see what's actually different. This is why newer / purposefully-designed UI only shows _changes_ from the defaults, or makes them visually distinct.)
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ae832b2e3196
Think, before you go too fast!

It is of course not necessary that I open a new bug, because it is a mistake on your part.

And how do you refuse or set it to "always ask" geolocation for all sites, without the opportunity?
Put the possibility of choice in the privacy options. Thank you.
Choice to:
_refuse
_toujours request

Thank you on behalf of disgruntled users!

Sure, but it still gave an overview of all sites that might have been given say microphone permission, where users could, by hitting down-arrow repeatedly, at least manually audit sites where microphone had been allowed and correct each one if so desired, say, after reading some upsetting article [1] caused them to rethink their privacy stance.

Without about:permissions, the user basically has to remember every site they ever granted microphone access to, and revisit each one online and pull down the PageInfo drop-down (but see bug 1224453), a tall order for someone wanting peace-of-mind that websites are no longer be listening to them while they're browsing.

While WebRTC can be disabled entirely from about:config, this is undesirable, and has (until now) been unnecessary to solve this.

If my only jacket has a hole in it, then removing it still makes me colder than I was before.

Somebody can revive Kairo's Tahoe Data Manager[1] (source: https://hg.mozilla.org/users/kairo_kairo.at/dataman/ ) or make something similar if they want a replacement.
