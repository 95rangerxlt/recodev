Line length/font size info:
General wisdom is that 45-75 characters per line is ideal — suggested by Elements of Typographic Style and many other solid resources.

This writing goes into explaining both font size proportionally and line width:

WIP, showing proof of concept.

So, this is a terrible patch that shouldn't be checked in, but let me know how you like the behaviour, and I can make a version that doesn't have the terrible bits.  ;)
There's an OS X build up to play with at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2301433/Firefox/Reading/Width-v1.dmg

Okay, since Michael is happy with this, let's send it over to code review.  :)

Note for posterity: these styles were probably placed on the body originally because we used to not have a #container element. Since this really only needs to apply to the content of the article (not the controls), it's fine to put them on #container.

This makes the width of the article really really narrow on desktop - there is almost twice as much as whitespace as there is readable content width: http://imgur.com/p3pDyel . This ends up looking really wrong. Is this really the intent here?
I'mma let Michael answer this one, since he's the designer and all…
(But I will note that once we have a reading list sidebar, it won't be as out of proportion.)
The width should maintain it's 660px max-height, with a min height of 300px for smaller windows.
Regarding our default size, which I'm assuming we may need to enlarge.

660px is about double what 30em is for most default font sizes. Should we reopen this?
I'ld be happy with either re-opening or filing a new bug and assigning it to me.
Although I'ld like to hear whether we want 45-75 characters _or_ 660px, because we can't have both at all font sizes…
(I mean, we could with crazy letter-spacing, but I don't think we want that.  ;)
Let us know when it is ready for uplift (not super clear)

This is ready now. I filed bug 1162873 which got closed as wontfix, so we should just uplift this to 38.0.5 and later.

Aurora is now 40 so approval is not required. I cleared the Aurora request.

This change needs to land on m-r (38.0.5) and m-b (39). Approved for both.
