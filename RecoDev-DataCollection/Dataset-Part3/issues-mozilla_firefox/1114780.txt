For now, the Web Animations API is pref'd off in release and beta because the API isn't stable enough.

But the work to expose this API through a set of devtools actors has already started. And some of it has landed, including tests that use the API.

So for now, those tests are disabled until:
- either the waapi is enabled for good,
- or bug 1112422 is resolved (and makes the waapi available to chrome code).

This bug is to re-enable them when possible.
