At least the following changes need to be made:

* Remove line about Talkback, which we are no longer shipping

* Move Charlton Company credit from Help | About to logo section of about:licence (bug 331538)

* Update the list of MPL Initial Developers.

The second of these probably has 1l0n impact, so ideally we'd fix that today.

Here's a patch. It's HTML-only changes, so can't break anything. There is l10n impact, though, so requesting approval for today :-)

You need to rev this entity if you expect localizers to fix this for their locales.

Does Camino use this version of about:license? There were some concerns in bug 396463 about removing the line referring to Talkback because Camino has not yet moved to Breakpad.
AndrewM: I checked in IRC; apparently Camino is not planning on doing another release from the trunk (which is what we are changing here) without moving to Breakpad. So it's OK.

I checked this in on the 25th, but seem not to have closed this bug. Oops.
