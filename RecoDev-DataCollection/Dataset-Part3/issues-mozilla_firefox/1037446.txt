Drive by: make sure to add r=harth on the end of the commit message.

Also, I'm not sure what the best thing to do here is, but it seems this element shows up in the inspector, so *if* document.head is available maybe it should still go in there to prevent confusion (seeing a new <style> tag below <body>)?  Then again, there is a benefit to putting it below everything in that it will have higher priority than even style tags added inside the body.  Just a thought, any opinions?

I considered doing a check to put it in the head if it's available. I decided to append it in documentElement since it had a visibility benefit (being after the body). I assume there would be confusion if we placed it inside of the head as well, but there is a chance the developer can see the new <style> tag added in the inspector. I didn't know about the higher priority, but I think that is also a plus.
