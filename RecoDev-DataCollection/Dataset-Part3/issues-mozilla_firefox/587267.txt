Currently our browser window XUL hierarchy looks like this:

<window>
  ...
  <deck>
    <vbox>
      <!-- everything in the UI except Tab Candy, incl. Firefox button -->
    </vbox>
    <iframe id="tab-view"/><!-- ohai, this is Tab Candy -->
  </deck>
  ...
</window>

So, in order to bring back the Firefox button, we'll probably need to rearrange the XUL hierarchy to move the Firefox button out of the deck.

pulls the firefox button out of the xul:deck.

also includes a temporary margin-top for tab view to leave some space between the firefox+min/max/close buttons and tab view.

Just move the deck down, right before <toolbox id="navigator-toolbox"...?
