We also list @imported style sheets in the style editor. We find them by iterating through the rules of each style sheet looking for @import rules. If the sheet isn't loaded yet, this throws an exception.

It's rare that it hasn't loaded before it's included in the stylesheets list, but it can happen if there's an import rule.

async getCSSRules()

This change is basically just the product of a chain reaction of making one thing async. Asking for review from resident Task.jsm expert.

I'm really hoping this will fix the orange here: bug 949355. Try is good so far: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=cf73273617e5

Looks good. Should be a lot more stable this way.
The only thing that might be a problem is the getCSSRules method as my comment below explains.
r=me with this fixed (or clarified if I'm wrong).

Can you add a comment about the @return value?

I have to admit this looks very strange, I had no idea this was the recommended Task.jsm way of resolving to a value.

Comment should be updated here too since the method now returns a promise.

It seems that if this method is called several times quickly before the stylesheet is loaded, it will add several event listeners.
I think we should create and cache the promise once so as to return it to subsequent callers of this method.
It's particularly important that this method is public.
