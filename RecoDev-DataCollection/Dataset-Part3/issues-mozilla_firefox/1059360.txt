Like bug 1056990 but for the computed view.

There are selectors too in the computed-view, you can see them when you expand any of the properties.

When hovered, the nodes matching the selector should be highlighted too.

Needs a new test, but should work.
Also makes hover tooltip work on expanded property values.
