As a user, all of my primary buttons were aligned to the right. The only things I had aligned to the left were the RSS Icon and the status bar shim. Both were managed courtesy of a flexible spacer. I can no longer achieve this designed effect.

Reproducible: Always

You've tried 'Restore Default Set', yes?
I've tried 'Restore Default Set' and as such I can now right align items but can't left align items.
From my comment in the other bug:

The right alignment bug happens if you have a flexible space in the addon-bar.
An easy way to fix it is by opening localstore.rdf and adding "addonbar-"
infront of "spring" in the list of items under the addon-bar (search for
browser.xul#addon-bar and look under currentset).
Dropping items on the left side of the add-on bar seems to work just fine for me.

How are you achieving this Dao? I'm attempting to use the flexible spacer and I'm getting no such luck.
All I did was to restore the default set and drag an item to the left of the add-on bar. I'm not sure what you mean by "use the flexible spacer".
When customizing the addon-bar you can add a flexible space to teh addon-bar which you can drag around all you want and place new stuff on both sides of it. 

The spacer added in the patch (addonbar-spring) isn't visible at all when customizing nor can it dragged anywhere. That is probably what is causing all the problems.
Ah, I see what you've done.

What I'm attempting to do is left align an icon along with the status bar shim.
This worked previously. However now, I'm unable to force the status bar shim to
the left using a flexible spacer from the customisation palette.

This makes the spring (re)movable.

i don't understand - you put a spring in the currentset but not in the toolbar itself.
toolbar.xml creates springs automatically.
