Perhaps we should add this helper to the harness?

Will look into that elsewhere but might be a good idea.

Thanks Dave!
I've checked this in on the 1.9.0 branch as well since it was being hit there fairly frequently on the linux boxes.

mozilla/browser/fuel/test/browser_Application.js 	1.4
Marking verified for 1.9.0.5 as I see that the test is passing.
