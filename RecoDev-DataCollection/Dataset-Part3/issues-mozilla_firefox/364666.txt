When I open the browser, all the commands work the first time but will not work on second try, can only access the commands through the keyboard commands....ALT+F, Atl+E, etc....... It will not clear......even though if I cursor over a command and click on it, sometimes it will dropdown, sometimes not.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Closing the window and re-opening it does not clear it up BUT if I re-boot my machine, the commands will work again on the first try and not again.


I have not been successful in getting this to clear up.  It seems to be a new feature.

Update your theme if it has released an update since 2.0.0.1, or switch back to the default theme until it does.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 364424 ***
I do not think this is a dupe of any other report.  
I have NOT applied any themes to my browser, this is not about any saved favorites, or any added plugins.

This is about the MAIN browser command toolbar.
"File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help"

All icons work normally.

And it WORKED perfectly UNTIL about a week ago when the latest update to Firefox
installed.

Before a week ago.....my computer was not on for at 3 weeks.

If you still think this is a dupe......then pls tell me the URL for a fix.


I un-installed, re-booted, installed newest version.....

ALL IS WELL.

For the time being.
