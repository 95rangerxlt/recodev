When I push the "Clean now" (I don't know the name in english, but in French, it's "Nettoyer maintenant") button of the Private data (?) tab of the Options menu, nothing happens. I try to click again and again, and the clean's popup window never popup. I didn't change neither my Firefox version nor my installed components but one day, it wasn't working anymore. There is no crash or error message.

No problem here with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2 when I have checked the box "Ask me before clearing data". Without the check mark in this box it also works OK, but it doesn't show the Clear Private Data window.

I tried to check or uncheck the "Ask me before cleaning data" but there is no difference : the Clear private data window never popup. Is there a way to reset Firefox in order to restart with a clean and safe state ?
You could try it in Firefox's -safe-mode, with a new profile or a reinstallation in a new empty folder.

I started Firefox in safe mode and was able to delete the temporary files.
Then I closed Firefox and started it in the regular mode. It's working : I can see the clearing data window now. Thanks a lot.
