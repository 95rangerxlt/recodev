In Firefox, I have the JavaScript slate (scratchpad). I select some text inside, and I want to drag-and-drop it inside.

During drag-and-drop, there is no clue about it. Usually, in Firefox and elsewhere, there is a clue: a rectangle, or the text following the mouse… Here, there is no clue. So I think that drag-and-drop does not work. I know that drag-and-drop is sometimes buggy in Firefox. But here in fact drag-and-drop works.

It would be nice to show a clue during drag-and-drop, to so that the user know what is happening.

Thank you for improving that.

I encounter the issue on Mac OS X 10.6.8 in Firefox 35 and in Firefox Nightly.

The requested enhancement would also help the user to aim the wanted target.
Maybe arrived from https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/commit/5e834b99421d5974d26e08f17ca969cdfa2f14cb.
