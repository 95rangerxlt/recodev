When landing bug 571902, we missed adding services/sync to the list of directories that matter in filter.py.

Thus compare-locales isn't reporting on those strings, and it's not triggering l10n-merge either.

Bad me for not checking that things look right at the right time.

add services/sync to initial module check in filter.py

Benjamin, I wouldn't know someone less off, and you've had this on your mind just a few ago.

See bug 571902 comment 84 about my question on whether we should actually bother disabling services/sync in browser/locales/Makefile.in or if that's going to be just on in a few anyway.
We need services/sync to actually show up in compare-locales and the build.

PS: services/sync/locales/en-US is identical to weave-l10n/en-US, for which we already have a ton of localizations :-)
