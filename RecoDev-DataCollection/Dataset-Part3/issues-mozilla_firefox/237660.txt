While using Tools->Downloads->Options->Themes, then select "Get New Themes"
nothing happens,but if we do Tools->Options->Themes and then select "Get New
Themes" a new windows opens
from where the user can install, submit or check out for avaiable themes.
Same problem can be seen,if we select "Extension" instead of "Themes" and then
select "Get New Extensions", but it works fine if we select
Tools->Options->Extensions and then select "Get New Extensions".


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "Tools->Downloads” menu 
2. Click on "Options" 
3. Select "Themes"
4. Select "Get New Themes", nothing happens.


Actual Results:  
Nothing happens when we select "Get New Themes".

Expected Results:  
A window should pop up from where the user can install, submit or check out for
avaiable themes.

This also affects the extension author links, see Bug 236241 for a related problem.
Yeah, certainly looks like a dupe of bug 236241 (similar concept, anyway). Mike,
what do you think?
not a dupe, but related (same fun with having a non-browser parent)

We know its broken, we just haven't decided on a fix yet :)

I wonder if hiding the categories panel and just showing the downloads portion 
of the prefwindow would be a good compromise, unless we want to engage in some 
trickery :)
This looks the same as 228932, probably could be marked fixed also.
true!
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
