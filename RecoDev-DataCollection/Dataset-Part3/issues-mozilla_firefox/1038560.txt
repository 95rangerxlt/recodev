This is a much better source for the files and directories and I recently noticed that new files aren't always being added to the uninstall.log possibly due to the numerous changes to app update especially with the addition of staging.

There is also some code cleanup with the removal of the NO_UNINSTALL_SURVEY define and related code as well as preparation for this to be used on install.

Even if the user installed to a user directory?  Not sure I fully understand this check.

The code below it will add a file named $INSTDIR\${FileMainEXE}.moz-delete that will be removed on reboot which requires admin. The file prevents an install until after a reboot and though there is other code that tries to clean this up there are cases where it doesn't.

I'm tempted to remove it entirely. There are still cases where files have been locked so I'll file another bug to make it more specific.

Changed this to use the __UNINSTALL__ define instead of checking _MOZFUNC_UN

Couldn't you just pass "false" "false" directly here?
I tried that when I wrote the OnStubInstallUninstall and it had issues. I'll check again.

I would like to get this and dependent bugs landed for at least Firefox 35.

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: Files are not removed on uninstall and files left behind can lead to problems with future installs.
User impact if declined: Files are not removed on uninstall and files left behind can lead to problems with future installs.
Fix Landed on Version: Firefox 36
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Small. Worst case scenario is that files won't be removed on uninstall. It has been tested thoroughly by myself and has been verified.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None

It's too late to take this change in Firefox 34 and ESR 31.3. We can consider it for Firefox 35 and ESR 31.4.

Taking this for Aurora (35). It doesn't meet ESR criteria and it's not clear there's much value here vs. waiting for 38.0ESR so unless there's a strong case for this from ESR deployers, let's wait.
