currently if i have a stacked group, the workflow to open a tab looks like:

1. click the stack
2. wait for the panel to open
3. click an item

sometimes i want a specific tab in the group, but i have to click and wait and then visually hunt for it, and click again. it's really stop-n-go workflow. it'd be smoother if the stack opened on mouseover (suggested change #1).

but most times i actually just want to open the group, without a particular tab in mind yet. my whole workflow looking like:

1. ctl+e (closing current workspace, opening tabcandy)
2. click a stack
3. wait for the panel to open
4. get a papercut because i have to choose a particular tab to open the group
5. click a tab

i'd prefer to have a way to open the whole group/stack without having to open the panel and without having to click on a tab. double-clicking the stack would be ok, or maybe a little corner button for this (suggested change #2).

Assigning to Aza for design.
Good call, Dietrich. There was a hysteresis in interaction â€” leaving a group and getting back to the group were not symmetric. Now, clicking on a group drops you back into that group. Command-clicking on a group opens the tray. Will think more about adding a "quick-look" button as per your suggestion #2.
