"willappopen" event comes with a window, not a frame. Not sure why it changed.

This is apparently not enough. willOpen is fired but the app list is not updated.

Part 2 comingâ€¦

Cancelling review. Apparently, we can use event.details.manifestURL

Review of attachment 8349366:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

That has changed in gaia, we are listening an event being sent from the system app window manager.

The appwillopen is now sent like this:
https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/system/js/app_window.js#L772-L781
It is no longer dispatched on the iframe but instead on the system app global object.

That change is fine to make it working again quickly, but it also highlights how weak it can be to listen a such event.

We should do better than this:
* Make it clear with system app team that this event is used in chrome code,
* Send a more explicit mozContentEvent from gaia,
* Use another best practice to communicate from gaia to chrome code.

I'll try to catch vivien to figure this out.
