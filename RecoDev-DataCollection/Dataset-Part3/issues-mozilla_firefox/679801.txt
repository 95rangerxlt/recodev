All buttons in a row on a glass toolbar

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110817 Firefox/9.0a1
Build ID: 20110817061121

Steps to reproduce:

1. Ensure you have tabs on bottom, so that navigation and menu toolbars are covered with Aero glass. Optionally enable small icons mode to allow inversion on navigation toolbar.
2. Move "New Tab", "Panorama" and "List All Tabs" buttons somewhere on the glass toolbar. Move some other buttons near them to compare inversion effect.


Actual results:

All buttons are inverted. "New Tab", "Panorama" and "List All Tabs" are not, and they are hardly visible against a dark background.


Expected results:

All buttons should get inverted.
