menubar must be disabled (firefox-button instead) and tabs must be on-top.
Can someone with Win7 please confirm?
Would take a fix, I bet it's small.
This issue also applies to the TabCandy-button, which was added there recently by default.
In fact it applies to any button that's placed in the area at the end of the tabstrip.
now this seems to have been partly fixed in the latest nightly. when moving the mouse slowly upwards the issue doesn't occur anymore. however if you move the mouse quickly this still happens.
WFM, win7, bet5pre. Has this been fixed?

Screenshot of the issue

This is not fixed in todays nightly (beta 6 pre). Window has to be maximized and you have to move the mouse rather quickly.
This is a screenshot showing the issue (the cursor is missing, because it's automatically removed when taking a screenshot).
confirmed, you have to snap the cursor up quickly, only reproducible in maximized windows. Not a functionality issue though, marking as polish.
This is probably a dupe of bug 613781, which has blocking.
