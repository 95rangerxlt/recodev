An example of a Geo icon in 64x64 as found on the InterWeb.

This is the icon that I have used in my themes.

What's this?

We usually try to avoid globes with real land masses, and the crosshairs on the US seems particularly bad... Can we use the Firefox globe for this?

To fix the huge left margin caused by using border image for the panels.

They are actually not real continents beyond a general location similarity that just happened to work out better in the composition.

Thanks!

We need a more generic solution to this, as the same panel style is going to be used for other notifications. I'd prefer this to be taken care of in a separate bug.

Even at a second and third glance I still seem to recognize North and South America. It's an icon, so it doesn't really matter that the borders aren't quite accurate, the rough shape counts.

Yeah I agree. Removed.

I tweaked them a little to try and mitigate that but in general I don't feel it is a problem and I feel comfortable with them as they are.

Thanks! :)
