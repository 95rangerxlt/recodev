Yikes, sorry about that. Patch coming.
Hm - this is harder than it originally looked.

I'm not sure where that second focus ring is coming from. At first, I thought that maybe the button-icon was somehow producing it, since forcing the button-icon focus ring to be a particular colour seemed to change the inner ring.

But if I force the the button-icon focus ring to transparent, the inner ring appears again - making me suspect that forcing the button-icon ring caused me just to cover up the inner ring.

So I'm not 100% sure where that inner ring is coming from. It doesn't seem to exist with gnomestripe or pinstripe...

Any ideas where that ring might be coming from?

This looks OK if we're happy to have the focus ring around the download item (-moz-dialogtext) a different colour than the buttons (ThreeDDarkShadow).
Although I think it's strange that the rule in my original patch didn't simply override the rule you linked to.
The rule I linked to sets a border rather than an outline.

Oh, of course.

Then, rather than simply removing the rule, could we override the border to use -moz-dialogtext, so that we appear consistent across each element in the Downloads Panel?
I wouldn't worry about it, ThreeDDarkShadow should work fine across Windows themes.

In that case, my r+ stands. Thanks for your work!
