Indeed, this is a regression from bug 352200.
Um they are recognizable because I can't make anything out? and does it really matter if they are?
Sorry forgot to update..yeah I can make out north and south America but I dont feel that it really matters if you can make out which continents are in the icon.

You don't happen to be a US citizen, do you? The Firefox icon wasn't changed without reason (it used to look quite Earth like as well): it might quite well alienate parts of our user base. Whether that's reasonable or not, the change should be quite cheap in this place - and rather be safe than sorry.
This is coming.
fixed images checked in.
Created attachment 238585
Content Icon cut off on right end 

Is it only me or am I seeing the new checked-in icon a little cut off on its right most end? Screenshot attached.
This is really starting to get funny, if you have a sick sense of humor.

Marking fixed since the original issue is done. Filed new bug 353141 to track edge cutoff issue.

reopen?
This certainly isn't fixed1.8.1, given comment 11.
re-adding fixed1.8.1; the globe in the file in comment 11 isn't actually the one used for the Content pane ... in fact, it's not used at all.

A separate bug should be filed to fix it, but it shouldn't block Firefox 2 release.
Filed bug 354642 to track the wrong-globe-in-EM-button-file issue ...
