Yesterday, my Firefox 2.0 en/us informed me it had downloaded an update which was to take effect upon next start of FF, i.e. today.  The update failed and repeatedly complains about faulty installations.  In one phase, it also complained about some ill-formed XML (unfortunately, I lost that message).

After uninstalling FF, I tried to manually install 2.0.0.1 en/us for WinXP.  This fails with the message:
"Error opening file for writing: \r\n\r\nfreebl3.dll\r\n\r\nClick Retry to try again, or\r\nCancel to stop the installation."
Yes, the back-slashes are displayed in the error message.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Hanging installer.

Expected Results:  
A correct update, just like previous ones.

I use no special themes or chromes.

Making this bug about just the installer.
Requesting blocking 1.8.1.2. A fair number of people on Vista are having this problem in the forums.

Should the bugs that were duped against this one that don't involve the installer be re-opened?
Is this happening possibly on a machine with multiple logins, and having Firefox concurrently open from two different logins? There was a bug filed on that, not sure if we had a fix or not

freebl3.dll is part of NSS (the Firefox encryption library).
Firefox.exe is obviously firefox.
nssckbi.dll (bug 365595) is part of NSS

Bug 369221 and both links in comment 8 describe xpicleanup problems which is something else.
Missing 1.8.1.2
Don't have enough information to seriously consider this a blocker. Need more investigation (answers to comment 10, for example).

I fixed it! I did a search for files containing the world 'mozilla', deleted them, and then it installed! not having firefox for a whole day really made me realize how much horrible internet explorer is :)
fixed by the checkin of Bug 369221
