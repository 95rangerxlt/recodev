The patch

Carrying over r+ from bug 887923.
The tryserver build from the original bug is here:

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=c8d18a501f2a
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/336c25e3063e
Add-ons that called the Promise variant will need to switch to the callback-based variant, or use the following technique for Promise compatibility:

new Promise(resolve => getShortcutOrURIAndPostData(query, resolve));
