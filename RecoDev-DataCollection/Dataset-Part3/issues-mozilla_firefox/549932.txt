When I narrowed the width of the browser window, as a matter of course, the width of the location bar becomes narrow.
In that case, the width of the tooltip of the location bar becomes narrow in the same way, too. 
and there is not the meaning of the tooltip.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Minefield width New Profile
2.Open Long  URL ( http://www.google.co.jp/search?q=Mozilla+Firefox&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a )
3.Narrow the width of the browser window
4.Show tooltip by mouse hover location bar


Actual Results:  
The width of the tooltip is the same as the width of the location bar.
I can not read whole URL.



Expected Results:  
The width of the tooltip should be unrelated to the width of the location bar.
And I can read whole URL without crop.

Sorry,
Build Identifier  in Comment #0 should be
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a3pre) Gecko/20100303 Minefield/3.7a3pre ID:20100303040025
*** Bug 610476 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
From bug 610476 there's no need to re-size the window to reproduce.

"Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a URL that overflows the URL bar.
2. Hover the mouse on top of the URL bar.
3. See truncated URL tooltip.
Actual Results:  
The tooltip is the same size than the URL bar and single line.

Expected Results:  
The tooltip expands to show the complete URL and is multiple lines if
necessary."
This is still an issue on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:6.0a1) Gecko/20110501 Firefox/6.0a1 ID:20110501030600 and I believe it is Platform Windows All if not All All. Can you change it accordingly?
It happens on Linux too,
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6322e8f7cb2d
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:6.0a1) Gecko/20110502 Firefox/6.0a1 ID:20110502030625
Is this still an issue? I can't reproduce it in
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0
Fixed by Bug 787275
