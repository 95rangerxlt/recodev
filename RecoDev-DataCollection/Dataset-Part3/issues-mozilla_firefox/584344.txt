This regressed with landing of Bug 552982
this is partially by design at this point. Before, the default level of the panels would sometimes cause the highlighter (also a panel) to obscure parts of the tree or style panel if they were over the browser.

There's another option I can try which sets the tree and style panels to "floating". This will make them disappear if the user clicks away from the browser and may be preferable in some cases.

I'll attach a patch to try out.

floating panels that disappear when losing browser focus. I think these may be preferable for now.

This is a tiny, tiny patch. Moving to dolske in hopes that we can give this a whirl for b4. I do think this will be a distinct improvement in behavior.

When a focus returned to a browser again, is the state of each panel restored?
If not, I do not think that this solution is too desirable.

level="floating" is the default value when a titlebar is present, so you could remove the level attribute.
does it hurt to be explicit here?
I'm not sure there's a win. Presumably we'll always want the default behavior for titlebar panels. I think I prefer just removing the attributes.

Yeah, what Gavin/Enn said. Let's just remove the level attribute.

Marking r+/a+ since that's a trivial change and can land directly.
agreed. Thanks for the review!
