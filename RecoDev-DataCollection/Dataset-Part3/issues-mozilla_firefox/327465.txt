Why don't we build localized uninstallers?
We're currently evaluating several options for the installer code itself, I don't
think that there is a good balance between the localization work involved and
the return in product value.
I'm watching where this goes and will make a call on whether we want and/or can
do localization of that based on timing and work involved.
Alexander:

This patch and the patch for bug 320504 was designed for a 1.5.0.x release.  Since we cannot change localized strings for a 1.5.0.x release, it is important that we not attempt to localize the uninstaller there.

On the trunk and 1.8 branch (which will be used to ship FF 2), Robert Strong is developing a new installer and uninstaller based on NSIS.  That solution will be fully localized.
