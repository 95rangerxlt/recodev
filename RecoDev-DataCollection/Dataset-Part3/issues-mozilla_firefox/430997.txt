This one only seems to work under some special conditions, but I think I've seen it on linux too, though I'm unable to test that atm.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the URL
2. click a personal toolbar bookmark
3. click back
4. select some text and right click
Actual Results:  
Note the greyed out Copy, and Select All options. Also note that the ctrl-a and ctrl-c keyboard shortcuts don't work.


-So far I can only reproduce this when a mozilla.org page is the original URL in step 1, wikimo works too.
-It only seems to happen when you click a personal toolbar item.
-refreshing the page restores the copy/select all

So I've now reproduced it on a number of sites and it's officially a regression :/

Likely culprit is bug 386782

Simplified steps btw:
1. Click a personal toolbar link (wait for full page load)
2. click back
3. Try to copy or select-all
This is likely to be OS All, but I can't confirm that.
Likely a regression, confirming.
Fixed by checkin for 430624.
