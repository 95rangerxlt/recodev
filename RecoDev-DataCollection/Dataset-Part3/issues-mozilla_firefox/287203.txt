Working on it.
Created attachment 178706
patch v1

Bleh, this was more work than expected. The part on plug-ins and helper
applications was a bit too technical. I also replaced "plug-ins" by "Plugins"
to be consistent with the UI, and "helper applications" by "external
applications" because that's clearer.
I need to make those changes in the glossary as well if you're ok with them.

I thought your proposed change was visually discontinuous when I was evaluating
it.  What do you think of it?

The last sentence is pretty awkward.  Instead of it, let's try, "You can find

How about, "For example, you can use your chosen media player to play MP3
files."?  This avoids excessive use of commas and is a more active sentence
than the original change.

The "it" is unclear here.  Perhaps you can be better at coming up with a fix
for this than I am right now.

How about instead, "Open the Privacy panel and click the Cache tab." (with

What do you think about replacing the second sentence with, "&brandShortName;
checks the Internet to make sure you have the latest version of the current
page and displays the newer version if it exists."?  "The computer" really
isn't very good, and we should replace it.

Anyway, pending response to these issues, particularly the ones where I had no
suggestions, r- for now.

Go ahead on this; it sounds like a good idea to me.

We don't need to repeat it. Like "This is my brother Ben. Ben is a quite nice
guy." You don't repeat that he's your brother in the second sentence.

Fixed.

Fixed with "the media player of your choice".

Yeah, good suggestion.

How's this:
<p>When you click on a file and &brandShortName; doesn't know how to handle it,
  a <em>Opening</em> dialog box is displayed, offering these choices:</p>

> Why was the platform-specific reference there before
Ask RJ. It was already in the first revision of this doc. It's bogus. There's
been a Clear button (part of the expander widget) at least since 2003-02-01:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/prefwindow/content/pref-privacy.xul&rev=&cvsroot=/cvsroot&mark=145-146#145
No #ifdef here, neither in pref-privacy.js.

> and how do we know it doesn't still apply?
There's no #ifdef here:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/preferences/privacy.xul&mark=256-259#256
The button can be disabled by setting the pref
pref.privacy.disable_button.clear_cache. But that's not the case.

No, it displays it anyway.

Agreed. And there are pages which are not in the "Internet" but on your disk.
How about: "&brandShortName; then loads and displays the latest version of the
page."

patch v2

I also tweaked index and glossary this time.
I removed the entry on helper applications from the glossary, since I've
removed that term from the doc.

My communication skills in this "sentence" were apparently at less than par. 
That last sentence was supposed to communicate that I wanted the sentence
rearranged so that it was a logical progression, e.g. "Select &pref.menuPath;,
open the <em>Downloads</em> panel, and click the <em>View &amp; Edit
Actions...</em> button to [...]" or something similar.	You apparently grasped
some portion of what I meant because it *was* slightly rearranged, but you
didn't get all of it.

Also, you seem to have a doubled "the" in this paragraph which needs to be
removed.

Looks good as long as you change "a" to "an" before "<em>Opening</em>".

Final patch, r=jeff per comment 7.
Asa, do we need approval for help docs? We didn't need approval-aviary for
these before we shipped 1.0.

Jeff, yes. You need approval. 
Oops, I mean Steffen. (too early in the morning here for me to be in bugzilla)
