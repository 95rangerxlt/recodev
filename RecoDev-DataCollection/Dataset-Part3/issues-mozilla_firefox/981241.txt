I noticed using "CSS" as a category when calling ReportToConsole does not actually categorize the message as a CSS message. After asking around, I was pointed to this code:

https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/webconsole.js#4545

I think we could use a little more flexibility here. At a minimum, I'd like to add "CSS" and "Layout" to the list of strings that result in CATEGORY_CSS. It might be even better, though, to categorize any string that begins with "CSS[ :]" or "Layout[ :]" as CATEGORY_CSS.

We've been fairly picky about categories to avoid 'leaking' unrelated messages into the webconsole (we already have too many messages being logged).

Make the CSS category in the web console more flexible.

Mihai and I talked on IRC and clarified that a patch like this should be OK.

I decided to avoid broadening the scope of this bug too much, given that I don't really know the needs of e.g. the security people, so this patch just adds additional flexibility for CSS and layout-related web console messages.

These do not need to be capturing regular expressions.

How about /^(?:CSS|Layout)\b/.test(category) ?
Thanks for the review!

That sounds good to me; will update the patch.
