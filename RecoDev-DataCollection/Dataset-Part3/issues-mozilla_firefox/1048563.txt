Objective: We expect to launch a number of experiments in seeing if we can drive positive user behavior by promoting browser features directly in the product.  We have two experiments in development, one to promote selection of Firefox as the default browser and one to create a Firefox Account.

We need to define a testing plan (likely using telemetry experiments) to measure the success of these initiatives.  

Acceptance Criteria:
*Working with the metrics org and the developers implementing the experiment, define a testing plan
