I got reported that someone on first use of the panel got a list with all the downloads in the last months, that shouldn't happen, should likely limit to the last X days or so.
The list in all conditions should fit in 4-5 downloads and have scrollbars for seeing the remaining.
This might be as simple as calling the cleanUp method of nsIDownloadManager on
migration in nsBrowserGlue.js, at the cost of initializing the download manager
synchronously on startup, or might involve introducing a mechanism that prevents
loading the downloads history on first run, in DowloadsStartup.js, by tuning the
flag we pass to ensurePersistentDataLoaded.
To be more precise, what we want here is to avoid old completed downloads from
the Downloads Window to leak in the session-specific completed downloads list
of the panel, when the feature is activated for the first time.
I think I'm going to try the DownloadsStartup.js route, rather than the nsBrowserGlue.js migration, since we'll likely only want to trigger this if the toolkit UI hasn't been selected...and migrations seem to roll the UI version forward regardless of outcome. Feels slippery.

I've added another pref, recording whether or not this is the first time the Downloads Manager has been initted with the panel enabled. If so, we run the clean up.

Let me know if I've missed any corner-cases.
The patch I've put up is based on the patch I put up in bug 766263, so I'm marking the dependency in case anybody wants to try this patch out.

If this gets r+'d before 766263 lands, I'll just rebase.

I _think_ we should be able to achieve the same effect by passing true to
ensurePersistentDataLoaded. In this case, maybe we should reset the preference
after the usual cleanUp on shutdown, to avoid old downloads actually reppearing
in case of crashes before the browser shuts down. Can you verify if this works?

Paolo:

Is this what you had in mind?  The behaviour is more or less equivalent, except that if the user opens up the old downloads window, they can still see all of the old inactive downloads on the first run.

But other than that, it seems much the same.

That's right. Since this is the same behavior as the current Nightly, and won't
influence the Library window, I think this solution is better, for the startup
performance improvements it will give once every piece is in place.

+        if (this._panelFirstRun) {
+          this._panelFirstRun = false;
+        }

nit: is this actually faster than just setting the value, without the if?

I don't actually know. The performance hit of writing a pref isn't something I've studied.

I'll trust your expertise in the matter. I've removed the conditional.

I've no expertise, mine was a real question :-) But without a reason to do
otherwise, I agree the code is just simpler without the conditional.

With bug 766263, we end up having 2 prefs that sound like are doing the same thing, even if they are not.
We should either:
- unify the 2
- clearly rename this to not make it sound like it refers to some first use

To unify we may store a cached session variable to avoid reopening in the session, while on next restart just go and read this firstRun pref.

if we are using toolkitUI the panel should not have had a first run.
I know this is correct code-wise but the name is misleading, call it dataFirstLoaded or whatever else, but don't use panel if this may happen regarless it being used.

yeah better. I still don't like this session restore code as a whole, but I guess it's just session restore itself that is confusing.

So... why not keeping the pref name that is clear enough as _firstSessionCompleted
you invert the pref here, then you invert again in _recoverallDownloads... so we can just never invert the meaning.
