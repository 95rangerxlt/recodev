patch

Our Google search engine icon is outdated.

Spun this off from bug 848150, because switching from a 16×16 to a 32×32 icon caused mochitest-bc to fail almost every time exclusively on linux64 opt & pgo, and it fails near the beginning of the first mochitest-bc test:
chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/browser_CTPScriptPlugin.js
logging the following TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL:
should have a click-to-play notification (about:blank)
instead of the following TEST-PASS:
should have a click-to-play notification (plugin_test_noScriptNoPopup.html)

screenshot of test failure

This is a screenshot of the test failure.
Absolutely nothing looks wrong, except that the intended test page didn't load.
The Google search engine icon looks fine.
Frank, these symptoms sound similar to the issue that was causing bug 851516. Can you try again now that bug 851516 has been fixed?

That sounds exactly like what I saw last night when I was debugging this.  I was going to file the same bug so thanks for saving my time. :)  I'll double-check the fix in a bit.

Thanks for your help, guys. :) Just pushed a new try run here:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=b360434104f9
After five consecutive linux64 mochitest-bc test passes, this looks good to land now.

Landed!

Now, we have the right shade of blue in our Google search engine icon, and, as a bonus, every Firefox-provided image in our default primary UI supports HiDPI on OS X.
