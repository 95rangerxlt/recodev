When focus comes back to application root, update gLastFocusedNode to that
document node. That's a special case because we don't fire MSAA focus events
for the main window, since the system does it for us and that would be
redundant.

We have to keep gLastFocusedNode updated. The accessibility code has compares
the target of focus events with gLastFocusedNode in order to prevent the firing
of duplicate focus events.

Low risk fix. Seeking a= for 1.8b4 on the basis that it is only in the
accessibility core and does not affect mainstream users.

Lockdown for beta one happened last night and we've got candidates in hand so
this will need to wait until first thing in beta two.
