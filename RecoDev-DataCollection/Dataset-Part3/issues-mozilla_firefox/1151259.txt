I can confirm this happens in Nightly (40) on Linux.
The bug appears to be present in 38 - 40, but 37 appears correctly.

It looks like <toolbar> has a default style of padding: 2px 0[1] on Linux only which leads to this.  However, that styling has been present for many years, so it can't be the root cause.

Brian, any guess what might have introduced this?

[1]: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/linux/global/toolbar.css#23
Got a regression range of: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/pushloghtml?fromchange=2b6bd6b2dfb6&tochange=369a8f14ccf8.

Most likely candidate seems to be https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/0d7bbd6633c3 (Bug 1101569), which changed the way those sidebar tabs are generated.

The other changeset that landed in that bug was includes the line that introduces the toolbar: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e40dfb7e4ec7#l1.131.
Here is the toolbar element: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/framework/sidebar.js#123.  I don't see any styles that are intended to apply to this.  If that's the case, the easiest fix would be to just switch that to be a box element.  Patrick, any reason in particular this is a toolbar or can it be switched?

As long as the <toolbarbutton> in that toolbar still works, this can be anything at all.

Does this do the trick?

Looks like there are some test failures due to the element changing
