There are three major areas of tab management in the browser:
- Current tabs
- Synced tabs
- Recently closed tabs
- Tab groups

Right now, most of them are very hard to discover. We should find a design that integrates and surfaces these kinds of features.

WIP Mockup

Documenting some work in progress here.
This concept combines:
- tab overflow
- synced tabs
- recent tabs
- tab groups
- optional side tabs
The current prototype is located here: http://phlsa.github.io/ff-tab-center
This is not a completed spec, but a basis for further discussion.
Non-destructive filters (by date, by domain, by name, by session?) would be greatly appreciated. For example: show [x] in this group [ ] from all groups [x] opened on dd.mm.yyyy [x] from reddit.com [x] yesterday.

Add to that groups that accumulate tabs by filter.
The interactions are now defined here:
http://phlsa.github.io/ff-tab-center

This prototype actually shows two different things: the full implementation of tab center that we are aiming at, and a good first step (MVP), which is essentially a version of side tabs.

It doesn't fully cover every detail and edge case right now. That's fine because some things will likely change during visual design and implementation.
Has there been any movement on this?

Not really, because there's no activity in there either.
