The Tooltip class re-emits all show/shown/hide/hidden events that are emitted at XUL <panel> level. But because of event propagation, any element that emits those same events within the <panel> will cause the Tooltip class to re-emit them too (this happens with <select> elements for instance).

The simple fix is to check event.target to avoid emitting unrelated events.
