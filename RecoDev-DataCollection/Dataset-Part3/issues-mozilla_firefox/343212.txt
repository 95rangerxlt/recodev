Bug 254021 introduced a restore closed tab(s) function but the clear private data tool doesn't remove the closed tab history, potentially disclosing personal information reachable after leaving the user with a false feeling of having cleaned everything by closing the sensitive tab + cleaning browsing history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open two tabs, close one of them
2.Open the Clear Private Data tool, and clean the 'Browsing History' item
3.Go back to your main window and try to undo the last closed tab

Actual Results:  
The last closed tab shows up

Expected Results:  
All my previously closed tabs should be cleaned out

Should *disabling* history also disable the Undo Close Tab feature?

> Should *disabling* history also disable the Undo Close Tab feature?

I don't think so, since we don't keep the previously closed tabs beyond a single session. But maybe. I'm just not sure that the user who doesn't want their browsing history recorded is also expecting to lose undo-close-tab functionality as a tradeoff.
--> blocking, TM beta2, will accept patches earlier if they're reviewed, landed and baked.

I'd rather use i than ix, to be consistent with the rest of the codebase, otherwise r=me

ix should be OK since we're not iterating over integer values but hash keys (which BTW is quite consistent all through nsSessionStore.js).
mozilla/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStore.js 	1.28
Is this check in for firefox 2.0 yet or only on trunk?

Problem: the undo-close-tab data is not cleared when session history is cleared.

Solution: clear it out upon receiving the browser:purge-session-history notification.

Risk: Low

This is checked in on branch, but unconfirmed in the latest build b/c clearing browser history is throwing errors. (I don't see them in my local build, just in the tinderbox build)

I'll look and see if this is related to this patch, or filed, etc.
The error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsISHistory.PurgeHistory]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: observe :: line 654" data: no]

This is already checked in.
Also... Shouldn't there be an option to enable/disable this in the configuration for "Clear Private Data" to be consistent?

NM, I see this is tied to browsing history in "Clear Private Data".  Makes sense!
