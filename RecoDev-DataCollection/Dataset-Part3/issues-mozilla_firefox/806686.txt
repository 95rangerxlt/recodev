In order to port this test, the file needs to be copied to the perwindow/ directory, and then instead of setting privateBrowsingEnabled, we need to open a new private browsing window and then run the test on that window.

Patch v1

The test is ported to PB perwindow model as I think it should be. However, the former test (the one in global directory) doesn't pass, it has this error:
 JavaScript Error: "TypeError: notification is null" {file: "chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/global/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js" line: 23}
So, the new test has the same error too:
JavaScript Error: "TypeError: notification is null" {file: "chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/perwindow/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js" line: 25}

I tried to fix it by:
- setting an interval to wait for the notification
- importing the "resource://gre/modules/PopupNotifications.jsm" in case it wasn't loaded properly
- using executeSoon
However none of it solved the problem.

So, please let me know if you have any idea about it.

First of all, you need to access PopupNotifications from aWindow.

Also, there is a whole bunch of asynchronous stuff before the notification object gets created, so you need to "wait" until that happens.

I decided that I'll fix that and land the patch.  Here's the changes that I made to your patch: https://gist.github.com/4068961
