Is nobody looking into this?
Why was this marked as fixed?  I still see it w/ 3.0RC1 (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051202 Firefox/3.0)
I was the original reporter on this.  It somehow disappeared for me.  I haven't been able to reproduce it.
I removed localstore.rdf from my profile and the problem went away.  Something from the upgrade from 2.0.0.14 to 3.0rc1 must have frozen the width/height entries in localstore.rdf, I suppose, but removing the storage file fixed it.

The bug should really be marked as WORKSFORME since there was no actual fix made to the firefox code.
