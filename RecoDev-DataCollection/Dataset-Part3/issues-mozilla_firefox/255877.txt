Also replace the bogus switch by an if clause.

Mike, since you reviewed the bug 245984, which introduced this, would you mind
looking at this?
Bug 243235 (remove expand/collapse context menu items) is plussed for 1.0.  How
about fixing that instead?
The patch for that one hides Expand/Collapse from the bookmarks menu and folders
on the bookmarks toolbar, see bug 243235 comment 17.
Whether it should be removed from the bookmarks manager and the sidebar as well
is still under discussion, see comment 14 and 18 in that bug.

That one should be fixed by 1.0, while this one looks so broken that it should
be fixed immediately.
