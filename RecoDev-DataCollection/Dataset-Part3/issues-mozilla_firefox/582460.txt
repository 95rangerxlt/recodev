[checked-in] Proposed patch, part 1.

The way the filter buttons should look isn't hammered out and won't be until the meeting on Thursday or Friday, but it shouldn't look like it does now. This patch implements the minimum needed to ship Firefox 4 (IMHO): a group of checkboxes.

I'm requesting betaN blocking status for this bug because the current styling for the filter buttons on the Web Console gives no indication to the user that the buttons can be toggled on and off is consequently very confusing.
