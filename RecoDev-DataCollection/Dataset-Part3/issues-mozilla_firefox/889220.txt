Current string:
  More Tools to Add to the Menu and Toolbar

Issues:
* "Toolbar" should be plural as more than on is customizable (menu, tab, navigation, bookmark)
* The text is too focused on the additional buttons to be added to the menu and toolbars.
** I think it should specifically mention dragging-and-dropping and make it more clear that you can drag items out of the menu and toolbars as well.


Side note: perhaps there should be some kind of first-run demo on this page for the first few visits? For example, it could show a button being dragged between different regions.

This is probably a dupe of the "make customize more more intuitive" bug, or vice-versa.

update Australis customize mode header,

Just spoke to matej, and after some touring around the browser, he decided that we want

"Additional Tools and Features"

With that capitalization.

Oh, whoops. I just landed this with that capitalization.

So, marking r+ with the adjusted capitalization per IRC, landed as:
