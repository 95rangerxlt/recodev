If you click and drag the favicon in the site identity button to some place you're not supposed to and drop it (say, the titlebar area or over the stop or reload button) the site identity button stays depressed and isn't dismissed correctly when you click somewhere in the titlebar or main toolbar areas. 

steps:
1. click, drag, and drop the site icon to the area of the unified toolbar just above it and release. 
(note the depressed state of the button)
2. click somewhere in that titlebar area.
(note that the button stays depressed)
3. repeat with the search button in the searchbar to see expected results.
