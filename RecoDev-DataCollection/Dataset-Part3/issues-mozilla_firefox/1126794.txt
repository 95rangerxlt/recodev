Adds uz to browser/locales/shipped-locales

The Uzbek (uz) locale is ready to be added to shipped-locales for Aurora and Beta. The attached patch adds the locale for Beta, but we'd like this to also be ported to Aurora. As I do not have commit access, this patch will need to be commited for me please. Uzbek has completed localization on Firefox 36 and has received a full sign-off from us to begin shipping in Release.

As usual, this is not going to land on mozilla-central.

Are we going to uplift it to mozilla-release on Feb 16 (next beta-to-release uplift) or is it going to be beta-only for some period?
We're taking it for uplift to release on Feb 16.
Yay!

A quick check shows builds created for all platforms for UZ, in Firefox 36 Beta 6. On Windows 7 x64 the build installs and works correctly.
