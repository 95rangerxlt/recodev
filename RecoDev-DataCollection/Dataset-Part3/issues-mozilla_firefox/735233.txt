Wit bug 249735 fixed, F6 now cycles through URL bar and content but no longer stops at the current tab on the tab bar.

Holding Ctrl or Shift while pressing F6 cycles through content and the current tab on the tab bar but never stops at the URL bar.

IMHO this is a small regression on keyboard navigation.

I'd suggest the behavior to be like:
- pressing F6 once focus URL bar,
- pressing F6 twice focus web content,
- pressing F6 a third time focus on the current tab on the tab bar

Holding Ctrl or Shift while pressing F6 should cycle in reverse order, but the order should be consistent.

This doesn't make sense...

It might make sense to rename the command as now it doesn't always go to the next frame, but I'm not concerned either way.

Yeah, it's not ideal, but for lack of a better name I'd just keep it. "Next" is ambiguous enough that it's not exactly wrong... it's just the next frame in the opposite direction.
