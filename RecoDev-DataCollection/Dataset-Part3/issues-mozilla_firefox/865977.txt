The function at https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/file/714e20f9b4e5/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml#l1256 includes many copies of the XUL namespace string "http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul".

We can clean up some of this duplication by declaring:
> const NS_XUL = "http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul";
at the top of the function and then replacing instances of this long string with NS_XUL throughout the function.

I counted five instances of this string within this function. There may be other functions within tabbrowser.xml that could use a similar cleanup.

Looks fine, but this bug would have been better to leave for someone who hasn't fixed a bug in Firefox before :)

Ekanan, can I assign you some bugs that require some deeper investigations?
which bug?
