CustomizableUI.serializerHelper() helps serialize a Set via converting it to an array, by iterating over the set like so:

  [i for (i of set)]

Now days we can just use the spread operator, which is more concise and should be faster:

  [...set]

Neat. Today I learned about spread. :)

There's another place where we can use this in getUnusedWidgets. Let's do that there as well.
