I could be missing something, but I just looked at the build config log for the official universal binary machine for 1.5.0.x and I don't see a software update channel being enabled on the machine. It should be set to the "release" channel.

# Configure flags
ac_add_options --enable-application=browser
ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-O2 -g"
ac_add_options --disable-shared
ac_add_options --enable-static
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --enable-official-branding
ac_add_app_options ppc --enable-prebinding

This would make it hard for us to use software update to upgrade folks from 1.5.0.2 to 1.5.0.3 :)

I could be missing something, but if I'm not then this would block the 1.5.0.2 release for Fx.
Looking into it more, I see a lot of configure discrepencies between the universal binary tinderbox machine and the PPC based machine for 1.5.0.2.

PPC build machine has the following build config flags which are missing from the UB version:

ac_add_options --enable-update-channel="release"
ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --enable-update-packaging

ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.8.sdk
ac_add_options --enable-svg
ac_add_options --enable-canvas

I suspect the macos-sdk verson is no longer needed, so that's probably ok. But what about the missing debug, update-packaging, svg and canvas flags? Seems like we would need all of those. 

Per discussion at triage meeting, granting blocking nomination.  Need to check Thunderbird build as well when we have an official build.
New builds are spinning right now; update channel should be fine.

Scott: I thought -canvas and -svg were 1.8-branch only features; am I wrong?
Hey Paul, svg and canvas are part of Firefox 1.5 (and by inheritence, 1.5.0.x).

Now it could be possible (but I don't think it is) that those flags are enabled by default even on 1.8.0, making the flags unnecessary in the build machine's mozconfig file. It might be worth getting someone in QA to to try testing svg and canvas on the UB to see if that stuff is working. 
Mark, can you confirm that we do indeed want to ditch the mac-os-sdk line when moving to the universal binary? I just want to make sure we aren't going to end up with a UB that won't run on an old version of Mac OS X because we took this line out :)


Confirmed.

You absolutely DON'T want the SDK line in your own mozconfig.  The SDK must be different for the ppc and x86 builds, so it's handled in the universal mozconfig:

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/build/macosx/universal/mozconfig&rev=1.2.4.2&mark=49-51#49

svg and canvas are still both off by default, you MUST turn them on in your own mozconfig.

disable-debug is the default, you don't need it in your mozconfig but it won't hurt.
I went through the mozconfig for the 1.5.0.2 releases for linux/win32, and I guess I did remove the canvas/svg options (I guess I was thinking of Cairo).

I've corrected this, and kicked a respin.

The update channel should also be release now.

Resolving.
QA people: do you have BFTs for canvas and svg as part of your qualification checklist?
Mark: At this time, we have not yet developed bfts for canvas and svg.

In that case, I suggest you at least add canvas, svg, and mathml to the smoketest suite to catch potential problems like this sooner.  Here are some samples:

http://www.mozilla.org/projects/svg/lion.svg
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/texvsmml.xhtml

There used to be a canvas sample on www.m.o, but I can't locate it now.
