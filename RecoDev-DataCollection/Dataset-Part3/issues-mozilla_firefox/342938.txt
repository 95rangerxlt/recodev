We should make sure that all these are either not shipped or end up in distinct
locations (in case of talkback), so that overwritten README.txt's don't break
updates.

In the case of talkback it shouldn't get added to the install location by the installer since it isn't in a part of the directory structure that is used to copy files from (e.g. the root of the optional directory). The text of the file is the same as the app's readme as well... I think that the one for talkback should just be removed.
Fixed on trunk by the checkin of the patch in bug 350943
