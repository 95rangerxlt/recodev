If trying to export bookmarks (no matter which selected; e.g. the "main", "root"
bookmarks folder 'Bookmarks' or any other), the browser crashes. Similar to
#214966, but nobody has mentioned that Firefox would crash on export. Import
works fine in the latest build.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open bookmarks manager
2. click File > Export...

Actual Results:  
Browser crashes.

Expected Results:  
Save the exported bookmarks in the specified file (e.g. bookmarks.html).

I followed you steps but it works fine for me. No crashes.
Even tried selecting and unselecting bookmarks links or folders.

I suggest you install Firefox in a clean directory and create a new profile, so
that you're sure it's the program and not, maybe, an outdated extension or a
theme...

Yes, it looks like a regression... Works fine with Fx 0.8, but it doesn't work
with the latest (trunk) build.
Confirming, tweaking summary, adding crash keyword.  I see this crash on the
20040220 build using WinXP.  I'm going to try to download a few older builds and
try to see if this is new as of that build or not.

Regressed between the 20040218 and 20040219 Win32 builds.  Exporting works fine
in the 18th build, but in the 19th it crashes.  Looking at the checkins, I have
no idea which was the guilty one.
Hm, I think there must be something wrong with the checkins for Bug #68215. To
be more specific, there is probably something wrong with the checkin that
removed the "mTabContainer" code.
Seeing this on linux:
