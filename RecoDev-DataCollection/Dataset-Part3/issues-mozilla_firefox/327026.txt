I just got firefox downloaded and I get a message wich tells me about a program called "Errorsafe" wich should search errors for me , since this whas a pop up from Firefox I downloaded it.
Sad enough after I downloaded it contained a Trojan , Trojan is a sort of virus if U didn't knew it.

Did this happen as part of the Firefox install? If so, where did you get Firefox? There are lots of places illegally redistributing our browser (and some distributing things that are not actually Firefox).

Or did it come up as a popup after browsing around for a while? Looking at your screenshot it's definitely a popup, not a Firefox dialog.

Beltzner: should we take the traditional "- Mozilla Firefox" suffix off titlebars? Makes people think it's from us. On the other hand scammers could just put it back in.
It whas a pop-up , I didn't installed Firefox anyhow but I never had this message when using Internet Explorer.
I suppose this whas just a pop-up so I guess this case is solved :-)

Thanks , Wouter
