By the way, if we want to minimize even further, note that we only need to send |minChunkSize| and path the first time and that we only need to send |filesToKeep| if it changes.

Maybe in a followup bug? Or do you think this is overoptimization?

In the future, you may wish to take a look at bug 763311, which might be well suited for your testsuite.

I am a bit lost here. Why is this change in the testsuite and not in the main patch?

Cough! cough!

That's true but I think this would indeed be a little over-optimized. The code would be a little harder to read and the caller would have to know about the worker's state which is not too ideal I think.

Yeah, we should do that. The new tab page and the thumbnail services are using test runners and we should sooner or later switch to Task.jsm.

That's just a minor change to make the test suite know the expiration has been finished. I thought it would rather belong to the test suite patch as that's the reason for this change.

Makes tests like this a little easier to write :)
