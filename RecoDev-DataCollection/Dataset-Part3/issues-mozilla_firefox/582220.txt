When I click in a video link on YouTube, while loading the video "frame", Firefox freezes completely for a few seconds, even stoping processes that have nothing to do with it, such as music being played, etc. After it loads, the video streams for more or less 2 seconds and it freezes the same way as before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to YouTube
2. Click on any video link

Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes completely for a few seconds while loading the video player. When it kicks in, it freezes again(the same way) while streaming the video after 2 seconds of stream being played. After a few seconds, the video streams and play as normal.

Expected Results:  
Played the video normally as it's supposed to do when you acess YouTube video.

This problem have some variations:

-Setting "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled" to "true" doesn't change the bug behaviour.
-Setting "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf32.dll" to "false" while "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled" is set to "true" displays this error message while loading the video player:

“A script in this movie is causing Adobe Flash Player 10 to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive. Do you want to abort the script?  Yes / No.”

Clicking no continues to render the player. Clicking yes makes the "player bar" disappear, rendering the player useless.

-When these options are in default("dom.ipc.plugins.enabled" on "false" and "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf32.dll" on "true"), you have the problem without the script error.
-This problem happens even on a clean install with only plugins installed.
-Using the following add-ons:

-Fission 1.0.9
-Download StatusBar 0.9.7
-Flashblock 1.5.13
-Adblock Plus 1.2.1

-Enabling or disabling hardware acceleration doesn't change anything.
-Using Firefox in safe mode doesn't change anything.
-3.5.11, 3.6.8(which I'm using), 4.0 beta 1 and Minefield have the exact same problem.

Resolved the issue, by formatting my HD and doing a clean Windows install.
