After bug 1014201 is fixed and in-content preferences have shipped and solidified on Release, we'll want to remove the old windowed preferences implementation.

This bug will track the necessary changes to accomplish that.

Taking this bug but it's low on my priority list. Waiting until tryserver says its green before requesting review.

Review of attachment 8607702:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming I didn't miss something, I think there are some tests that need to be ported to the new preferences. Possibly non-exhaustive list:
* browser_bug705422.js
* browser_chunk_permissions.js
* browser_cookies_exceptions.js
* browser_permissions.js

2 of these are for about:permissions so don't need any changes.

Part 1 WIP, remove support for old pref and delete old preference files

Try push https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=2fd71ed60e24, still more work to do (plus two tests disabled on that push: browser_cookies_exceptions.js and browser_bug705422.js)

Part 2 WIP, move preference files out of /preferences/in-content and in to /preferences
Created attachment 8612922
Part 3 WIP, start migrating and fixing tests
As discussed on IRC, can you split up the test migration + fixing into (a) separate bug(s) so we can ensure we get this all in sooner rather than later?

Should be all green with the tests now. The only thing that this patch doesn't do is move the files from /browser/components/preferences/in-content/ to /browser/components/preferences/

Patch for Aurora42

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: removing windowed preferences, new additions were made to in-content prefs for 42 that weren't made to the windowed preferences. it would be good to make sure that all users see the new preferences, so this removes support for the deprecated windowed preferences in 42.
[User impact if declined]: some users who opted-out of the in-content preferences will not see the new features that are targeted for 42.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: covered by automated tests, https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=cac021efbe65
[Risks and why]: low risk, removing dead code
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none

Patch for Aurora42

It would have been better to see that ride the train... but I understand the issue, so, taking it.
I'm hitting conflicts uplifting this to 42. Can you take a look?

This needs the "Patch for Aurora42" attachment. That attachment applies cleanly for me on mozilla-aurora tip.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/d1d92429871b
Helps if I look at the right patch. :)
