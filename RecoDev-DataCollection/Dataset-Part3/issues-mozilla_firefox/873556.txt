If one does:

var undoItems = JSON.parse(this._ss.getClosedTabData(window));

we have an array of closedTabs, but no way to figure out when each individual tab was closed. Although not usually important, Bug 565771 will merge recently closed Windows and Tabs into one pane, and the order of items must be based on a timestamp.

Currently we have no way to organize this data effectively, we will simply have an array of tabs and an array of Windows + tabs, and they won't be able to be combined into one list. If we had a timestamp we could re-arrange this data based on how recently something was closed.

I was unable to locate exactly what getClosedTabData and getClosedWindowData return, other than the fact that it is an array of tab/window data. 

Essentially we need to be able to access data like this:

undoItems[i].dateClosed = blah blah blah

Tim, can you give some guidance to Josiah on this?
Sure. Closed window data is saved here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/SessionStore.jsm#950

Closed tab data here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/SessionStore.jsm#1296

All we'd need to do is attach a 'dateClosed' or 'closedAt' property to those objects we're unshifting. Feel free to ask if you need some more guidance.

I now think that .closedAt would be a better name. We also should store Date.now() instead of a Date object.

Also, the variable name is wrong, must be |winData|.

Same here, closedAt: Date.now().

Take 2 :D
Is this still alive?
You'll want to set a review flag, otherwise it's easy to miss new patches.

Thank you, Seif! Can you please prepare the patch for checkin-needed [1]?

[1] http://blog.bonardo.net/2010/06/22/so-youre-about-to-use-checkin-needed
AFAICT i did all that... do you want me to rebase and try again?

Almost :) The patch description needs to be "Bug 873556 - Add a timestamp to closedWindows and closedTabs r=ttaubert" to denote that this patch has been reviewed by a peer. Also you should then set the "checkin-needed" keyword at the top of this page after you uploaded the new patch.
