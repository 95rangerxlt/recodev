comparision font size preferences links vs. sign in link

Latest Nightly and Aurora on Windows 8.1 Pro with 125% font size on OS level

After adding a Sync account, the Sync pane in the preferences has two two tiny links 'Terms of Service' and 'Privacy Notice'. All other privacy relevant links in the product use the normal font size (e.g. in Help > About Firefox, the Learn More links for Telemetry/FHR/crashes).

The Sync sign in page uses a normal font size. There is enough space in the preferences panel, so it should use the default font size.

In addition to that they are hard to read, it sends the feeling that Mozilla has something to hide.

The links have been made small in bug 971283.

As you already noticed, that has been done on purpose, eventually if they are really hard to read we could bump size a little bit.
Btw, needinfoing ryan who requested the change in the first place.
fwiw, they don't look hard to read to me (and my eyes are not really that good)
Reducing the font size below the OS default is generally a bad idea. We shouldn't do it.
I do see a "small" font on other panels in preferences, but I'm okay with these being at 100% size. Stay tuned for more detailed spacing requests on the Sync preferences.
Resolved in bug 1183352 and/or bug 1184170, which reformatted the Tos and PN links.
