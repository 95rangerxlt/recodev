FF does not execute the redirect formatted as &lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="0; url=/portal/server.pt?"&gt;

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://aionline.edu/
2. Click login, which goes to https://mycampus.aionline.edu/
3. https://mycampus.aionline.edu/ should redirect to https://mycampus.aionline.edu/portal/server.pt? using meta refresh tag.
4. End result, blank page.
Actual Results:  
Blank page at https://mycampus.aionline.edu/

Expected Results:  
FF should have executed the refrech command and redirect to the functional login page at https://mycampus.aionline.edu/portal/server.pt?

Tried this on two computers with FF 3.6.8, one 64 bit machine, one 32 bit machine.

works for me
I just checked, doesn't work here. What additional info can I provide? Screen shots?
Just discovered a weird thing, if I do a ctrl-refresh, it will execute the mate refresh tag.
You might have had an old version (or a corrupt one) in your cache (the redirect is cached if possible). Clearing the cache is often a good remedy for connection problems.
Ok, tried it, and it is not the problem.
I can confirm this on 32-bit linux, different website http://www.operamail.com
Problem seems intermittent, and I can temporarely solve it with Ctrl+R the blank page and opening page in new tab, however it always comes back.
Looks like it was fixed.
