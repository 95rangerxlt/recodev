Using AppManager, I install an app. Then I delete it from the simulator (by holding down the icon, etc), and press play again in the AppManager. I get the "{app name} installed" message and the icon shows up in the home screen just fine.

But the app won't be launched again, no matter how many times I press "play" on the app manager, or command+R, unless I close the simulator and launch it again.

Reading the code, I'm under the impression that "appUninstall" is only triggered by http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/webapps.js#921 upon "webapps-uninstall", which is in turn only triggered by http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/apps/src/Webapps.jsm#3525 when an app is uninstalled from the App Manager. I'm not sure this will be called when an app is manually uninstalled from the simulator.

I'll have to test this.

Why from the App Manager? Looks like it's triggered by dom/webapps, so it's global.

Works for me.

My r+ is not authoritative here. Ryan, could you please rubberstamp this if you feel confident with my review?

Looks good!  Interesting that we didn't update the running list on uninstall in AMv1...  seems pretty clear that you'd need to!
However, why does "app-manager.js" maintain its own set of running apps if it also uses WebappsStore?

It seems like you should refactor this (in a followup) to stop duplicating the list of running apps like this.

Yeah, initially I tried to avoid using code from /app-manager/. But I think we'll just keep webapps-store.js. Filed bug 1012831
Note to sheriff: no try build as this code is not compiled yet.
