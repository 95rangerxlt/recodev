Leading/trailing whitespaces in custom.properties and mui.properties are not ignored. We realized this issue after finding an extra whitespace in the menu item for "Safe mode" in a localized build (Italian).

This was already fixed for override.properties in bug 344148

Not sure if fixing this carries a risk of breaking locales that actually use the whitespace hanging around in custom.properties and the other one. Requesting wanted1.9.1.x, too.

Axel, could you take a look at this especially regarding the affect it might have on locales.
I found a few locales via grep that will be affected, I gotta do some test builds and go through a few install runs.

In regular strings that are displayed in a single UI blob, does the code remove surrounding whitespace at the windows layout level?
