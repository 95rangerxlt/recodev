Samples are the real deal.

Duration is this thing we generated from the samples, but is funky because we don't deal with harmonics, apparently.

Can we get a DXR link up in here?

Nice! Did you check if all the tests still pass?

Fix tests

Changed the failed tests to the expected values. All tests are now passing. However, since we're now sorting by samples and not by duration, we could change the test case to better reflect that (i.e. add another .A.B.D frame in http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/profiler/test/browser_profiler_tree-view-03.js#76 and update the expected results). Don't know if that's desired though.
Test improvements are always desired! :D
Christian, did you want this patch reviewed? Can you ask me for r? when you're ready?

Improved test cases

Added another .A.B.D sample to the test case to make sure some tests are failing if the entries are sorted by duration rather than samples. The expected values are updated. I changed the test cases in all tree-view-0X files to stay consistent.
Nice secondary effect: Tests are now passing on l10n formats not using '.' as decimal point, too.
