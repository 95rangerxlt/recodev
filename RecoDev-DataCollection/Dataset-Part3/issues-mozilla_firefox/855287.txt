The theme of this second milestone is Widgets. Essentially, we want to:

1) Determine what widgets we want to ship by default
2) Build those widgets
3) Repair or modify the customization infrastructure based on our experience building these widgets

There are also a number of follow-ups discovered from the first milestone that we probably want to fix.

Ideally, all bugs dependent on this bug (minus the next milestone) should have r+ by April 10th, 2013.
also you should disallow the ability to put (quite literally) anything into the widget area. some buttons (ex. firebug button) dissapear if placed there, and now I have no firebug button. also, there is no way to restore and get them back, since restore to default (and I quote from some person): 'is not yet implemented' for Australis customization.
We're moving away from using these meta bugs for tracking milestones, so this bug is closing (despite the old dependencies not actually being finished yet).

Folks who are interested in tracking the Australis milestones should search for:

[Australis:MX] in the whiteboard, where X is the milestone number.
