use SHChangeNotify

Doug, just from counting while setting as default without this patch it took anywhere from 7 to 11 seconds and with this patch around a second.

use SHChangeNotify

The difference is that only the shell will not get the update message whereas before, every top level window got the change notification.  I think this is reasonable and anyone depending on this sort of notification probably deserves to be broken.

Can you also change the call in RestoreFileSettings() as well?  Then you can also remove the MOZ_HWND_BROADCAST_MSG_TIMEOUT define.

With that, or reasons not to, r=me.

I've removed RestoreFileSettings() entirely in the Vista specific patch for setting OS defaults.
Checked in to trunk.
I file bug 354546 for removing the RestoreFileSettings cruft
