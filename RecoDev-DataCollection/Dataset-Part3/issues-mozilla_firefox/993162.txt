Right now the default indentation is 4 spaces. We should consider making it 2 spaces. I fetched a couple hundred random HTML/CSS/JS gists from github. Numbers:

HTML       CSS       JavaScript
====       ====      ====
57% two    56% two   45% two
19% four   21% four  32% four
16% tabs   16% tabs  18% tabs

Science.

Good science.

If there's a bias here, it's probably towards smaller projects. My guess is that larger projects often come from corporations which have coding styles, and my unscientific study says these are more likely to be 2-space based. So I'm all for this.

This'll make 2 spaces the default.

Drats, I ran all the devtools tests. I wonder why it didn't show up then.
