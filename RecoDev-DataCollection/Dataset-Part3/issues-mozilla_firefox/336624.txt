To reproduce:
- Focus search bar
- Dragdrop link into search bar

Result:
"Google Search" text appears again (in my case it's Google) in the search bar

Expected result:
The url of the dragged link should appear in the search bar

I guess this could be part of Mozilla's "dragdropping something in a text input doesn't focus" syndrom.

Probably just need to reset the "empty" attribute onDrop if the dropped text is not empty, or something like that.
Actually, I can't reproduce this bug, only bug 336625. When I mousedown on a link in the content area the search bar loses focus and the grey text reappears.

I don't understand something here. What is focusing the search bar in the first step for? It is going to be blurred in the second step anyway, when you click on a link to drag it. The "Google Search" greytext appears and we're back to bug 336625.
Doesn't work for me with current 2006-05-07 trunk build. But I think it will probably be fixed by the patch in bug 336625.
Martijn: is this fixed now that bug 336625 is fixed on the trunk?
I'll let you know as soon as the 2006-05-12 nightly is out ;)
Yes, this one is fixed now with the 2006-05-12 build.
