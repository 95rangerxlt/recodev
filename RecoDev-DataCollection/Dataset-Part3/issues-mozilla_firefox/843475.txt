Maybe this will be fixed by bug 812083, but :

1) Go to http://grssam.com/test/test.html
2) Open debugger (Ctrl + Shift + S).
2) See how many scripts are laoded, only 1 will show up as js.php
3) See actual source code, there are 2 scripts.

Both of the scripts are actually loaded, its just the UI that does not show them both as they have the same name "js.php" while the full url is different (type=1 vs type=2)

To see that both scripts are loaded (or in other words, recognized by the dbg server) :
1) Stat the debugger and refresh the page.
2) The debugger will pause 2 times, one time at line 1 of js.php and other time on line 4 of js.php, while it will show the same file in both cases, one of the file does not even has 4 lines.

One-source-instead-of-two-sources issue fixed by bug 812083.
Part of the behavior in comment #1 is (attempted) to be fixed in bug 785704.
I am seeing one script as "js.php" and the other as "js.php?type=2" , is that expected ?

If yes, why is that the first one got the query string stripped, and not the other (and vice versa)

Yes, it's by design.

Because it's the first source that showed up.

The second source had to be distinguished somehow, and the request param seemed like the best choice, according to the algorithm: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-panes.js#1117

File a new bug if you don't like it.
