jgraham today experienced a similar issue on Linux, with a nightly build from  2014-01-15, also with aus4 server.

Is the aus4 server broken today?

This is expected due to some concerns over a patch from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908134#c51. I think they'll be re-enabled later today...Nick will know for sure though.
That's right. I'm going to test in the next hour or two and if all is well re-enable updates after that.
Re-enabled at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908134#c58
This is not fixed for me!

Ah, you have a profiling build. When that branch got shut down (bug 936582) no-one thought about updates for existing users. A quick check on metrics reveals 1 ADI on 28.0, and an intermittent on a 29.0 build (??). I suggest you just modify <install_dir>/defaults/prefs/channel-prefs.js to specify 'nightly', probably need a restart to pick that up.

Haha, that 28.0 user is me!  :-)

Done.  That fixed the problem.  Thanks!
Assuming this issue is behind us, in case some future build is shipped with its update system broken (i.e. a build issue rather than a server issue), is there some mechanism in place to push a notification to users? preferably a mechanism which doesn't reuse the updates system code, and also other than at "Firefox home page" (sine not all users necessarily use it)?

Yes, that is one of the reasons the Add-on Hotfix mechanism was added. It uses the add-on update mechanism instead.
