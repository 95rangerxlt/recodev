This patch is one of the piece needed to have the hud working for the system app.

It relies on the patch in bug 1015894 that I'm going to land this week.

Nit: Since this is a prototype method of Target, the naming might be confusing here. Please s/target/frame/ or similar.

Nit: Please use `document.getElementById`.

This push hit desktop B2G mochitest failures. Not knowing the interdependencies of the push, I backed the entire thing out.

I think this produced issues in the Marionette JS tests (Gi in TBPL):
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=41112344&tree=Mozilla-Inbound#error4

Here is a try with this issue backed out:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=0fb26a81b986
This line is the likely failure:

    shell.sendEvent(frame, 'developer-hud-update', Cu.cloneInto(data, target));

"target" is not defined anywhere here...
Can we please backout this? I'm pretty sure this patch is the issue and so don't want to wait for try.

Then can you respin a build on moz-central ?
Try with Gi is: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=0fb26a81b986&showall=1
backed this out from mozilla-central (and so also in the upcoming merges from the other integration trees) in https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/c8288d0c7a15 as requested in comment #8 and on irc

Vivien, I think you forgot to rename the last occurrence of "target" to "frame" in the patch you landed.
