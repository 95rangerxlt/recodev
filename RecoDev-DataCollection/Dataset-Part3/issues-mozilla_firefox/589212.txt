Another pre-existing and referenced id, which means it's impossible for both
"Subscribe to This Page..." instances to work right now...

Only an issue on Windows right now, as other platforms have only one such menu item.

I've noticed that detaching a page with feeds leaves the menu item disabled in the new window until you switch tabs. However, this wasn't caused by my patch (it doesn't make it any better or worse), so I'll file a new bug.

Wouldn't hurt to have a test for this.
I won't have time to write a test for this in the near future...
