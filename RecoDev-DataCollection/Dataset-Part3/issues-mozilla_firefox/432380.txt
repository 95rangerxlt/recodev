also hardcodes a bunch of "accel" modifiers

Every locale uses "accel" for openHelpMac.frontendModifiers, preferencesCmdMac.modifiers, and hideThisAppCmdMac.modifiers,
apart from those which managed to translate "accel" to
"engetela", "അക്സെല്‍", "முடுக்கப்படு", "gijimisa", or "ఎక్సెల్"...
http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-central/search?string=frontendModifiers
http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-central/search?string=preferencesCmdMac.modifiers
http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-central/search?string=hideThisAppCmdMac.modifiers
So I hardcoded "accel" here.

hideOtherAppsCmdMac.modifiers is mostly "accel,alt", except el (Greek) and he (Hebrew), which have "accel,shift". That might be a bug or intention, so I'll leave that alone.
We could also hardcode "VK_F1" and "?", which are used by every locale.
At least these didn't get translated...

You missed the fact that "be" uses accel,shift for preferencesCmdMac.modifiers and hideThisAppCmdMac.modifiers.

I'm not sure that relying on MXR results to determine whether something needs to be localizable is a good thing - these might just be bugs in the locales (the translations of "accel" obviously are). Axel should make the call on this, I guess. The l10n note is a good idea either way.

You changed the id of key_openHelpMacFrontend but didn't update menu_openHelp's reference to it.
You overlooked "be".

I see a change that explicitly changes from accel to accel,shift for hideThisAppCmdMac.modifiers and others in http://bonsai-l10n.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?diff_mode=context&whitespace_mode=show&root=/l10n&subdir=/l10n/be/browser/chrome/browser&command=DIFF_FRAMESET&file=baseMenuOverlay.dtd&rev2=1.4&rev1=1.3

Siarhei, do you remember why you did that change?

That said, I'm not the best advisor when it comes down to international keyboard layouts, that's one of the things I hardly know anything about. Commandkey l10n is an "interesting" topic in itself, so while it's usually a good idea to not change anything about those, some locales need to do so. Whether the localizability should include the modifier or not is something that I don't know. I'd say "if one can, the other one should, too", so in case you want to expose hideAllOthers' modifier keys, you should expose them for hideThisApp's, too.

Simon, any opinions from your side?

I don't remember why I did the change. Probably, autotranslate proposed the "translation" and I didn't check it. I will revert the values to the original ones.

"be" now uses "accel" like everyone else: http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/be/rev/4139f74032ff

And "el" changed to "accel,alt" for hideOtherAppsCmdMac.modifiers as well: http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/el/rev/de93db7dbb70

So apart from the bogus translations of "accel", "he" is the only locale which uses a different modifier, i.e. "accel,shift" instead of "accel,alt" for hideOtherAppsCmdMac.modifiers.
And that is a bug as well, since "he" only differs in browser code, but uses the correct "accel,shift" in mail and calender code:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-central/search?string=hideOtherAppsCmdMac.modifiers&find=%2Fhe%2F&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=l10n-central

So I'm going to hardcode each and every keyboard modifier.

Grrr, fixed.

also rename openHelpMac.commandkey because it's changed its meaning

Changing the meaning of entities without renaming them is just asking for trouble, so I'm changing openHelpMac.commandkey (which is "/" right now), to helpMac.commandkey (which will be "?").
