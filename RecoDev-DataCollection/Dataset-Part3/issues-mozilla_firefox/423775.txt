A new bug has cropped up in Firefox v2.0.0.12:

Ctrl+Shift+Del doesn't work if following Private Data options are set in the Options menu:
Checked   - Always clear my private data when I close Firefox
Unchecked - Ask me before clearing private data

I have tried a complete uninstall and reinstall to verify that the installation wasn't corrupt.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure the Private options as noted in the Details.
2. Click OK to dismiss the options.
3. Type Ctrl+Shift+Del and nothing happens.

Actual Results:  
No dialog is presented.

Expected Results:  
The clear private data dialog should appear after typing ctrl+shift+del.
