The official Linux XFT+GTK2 build appears to be horked and does not start. The
build in question is this:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/nightly/2003-12-01-09-trunk/MozillaFirebird-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz

Note that the filesize on this build is also over 1MB smaller than normal, which
suggests the either the build did not complete, or something did not get
packaged. I tried my own CVS build using the same build options and it worked
(I'm using it to post this bugreport). Running the official build brings up the
Starting Mozilla Firebird thing for a few seconds, and then bails without a message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run ./MozillaFirebird
2. 
3.

Actual Results:  
Appears to begin starting normally, and then bails for no apparent reason

Expected Results:  
It should have started.

I'm not marking this as a blocker because the code appears to be okay, but its a
build machine or packaging problem I think.

Same problem with the 2003-12-02-09 build. Am just noting this so that we know
its not a one-off packaging error, but something that's consistent across daily
builds. Once again, CVS builds work fine.

[root@localhost MozillaFirebird]# ./MozillaFirebird-bin 
./MozillaFirebird-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libmozjs.so: cannot open shared 
object file: No such file or directory 
 
The behaviour in comment #2 has nothing to do with this bug. In fact, it's not a
bug at all. You should be running ./MozillaFirebird, not ./MozillaFirebird-bin.
If you run ./MozillaFirebird-bin, you WILL get that error, and this is by design.

Also, I'm just noting that comment #2 is with a CVS build, not an official
nightly (those won't be released for another few hours).
./MozillaFirebird didn't start at all, with no notice. So i tried
MozillaFirebird-bin and when i saw this message i thought it's the reason.

Secondly - it's from nightly. I made a mistake with build date. Mine was the one
from latest-trunk.

The exit code from the failure is "11", fwiw. :)
