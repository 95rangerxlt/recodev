Three problems here:
1. Left most tab (when cropped) has an abruptly cut top edge
2. Right Scroll button leaks animation color into white strip below the tab strip
3. Right scroll button during animation has white color leaking on top edge

Reproducible: Always

tab crop appears both on left and right side

1. Left most tab (when cropped) 
  this happens when the rightmost tab is focused and, tab shifts not fullwidth
4. Right most tab (when cropped) 
  same thing, but less obvious because there is no space between tab and scroll button (thats another bug?).

BTW: It seems to look a bit different on different window styles (I use classic style).
ron, can you try again with today's build?  I believe several of these issues are fixed.
