Close button

They are still coming from the platform-specific themes which make them look a bit alien (see screenshots). I'd expect them to follow the same visual language than, say, the back and forward button.

Throbber
Same for the refresh/stop button btw.
So the throbber, stop/reload button are tracked in bug 875479, and the close button in bug 879921.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 875479 ***
Actually, maybe we should keep this open for the stop/reload within the URL bar, as they're not part of Toolbar.png .
This bug can also be used for the throbber.
The throbber on Windows uses the green that's common for progress bars on Windows. The throbber on Linux uses the orange because there's really no single color that's going to fit all Linux themes and green felt natural at least on Ubuntu. Replacing it with the Windows throbber doesn't make sense.

"orange", of course

My impression from Australis is that it's heading more in a direction of cross-platform consistency as opposed to strictly following each platform's visual language. For instance, the main menu items in Australis uses the same style across platforms, right? Same for things like download icon, back/forward buttons (?), and others.

I can't see how the close button and throbber are any different. For instance, the orange throbber look a bit alien in the Australis visual language. The same likely applies to the green throbber on Windows (but I haven't seen it, can't tell).

In other words, I'd expect Firefox with Australis to have a throbber and close button (and almost everything else) that follows the Australis visual style. Am I missing something?
To back up what Lucas is talking about, Stephen has used this throbber, http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups-interactive/australis-interactive-mockups/images-general/spinner-connecting.png, in his new Windows 8 mockup (http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups-interactive/australis-interactive-mockups/windows8.html).

So maybe we should be thinking about updating throbbers for all platforms (not necessarily using the same one) so that they match the other Australis redesigned iconography.

That only shows the connecting, not the loading state, and a mockup isn't necessarily a final design either -- it can just be a sign of Stephen playing around with ideas.

But that's orthogonal to this bug. If there's a plan to update throbbers on all platforms, that should be filed separately.

Note that OS X has no hover styles. I guess Windows is closer, so it makes sense to copy that, but I figured I should note it.

Thanks Jared! This patch doesn't update the 'close' button on tabs. Is that intentional? Just wondering if I should file a separate bug.
