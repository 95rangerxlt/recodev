I see this too.  But not on a clean profile.

Better STR:
* Start Firefox with a clean profile.
* Use the resizer to change the sizes of the location bar & search box.
* Restart Firefox.
* Go customize the toolbars and remove the location bar.

The problem is that when the width is changed, the saved width gets carried into the toolbar palette.

fix?

This fixes the problem for me; I didn't notice any undesirable side effects during testing, either.

Since Firefox 2 didn't allow the search box & location bar to be resized, this is a problem new to Firefox 3, so I guess this could be called a regression.  I think it'd nice to get this fixed for 3.0.1 (even if removing the location bar probably isn't something that people will be doing very often).

Any way we can get a test for this?

fix?

Pushing approval out to 1.9.0.3.
We're opting not to take this in a maintenance release.
