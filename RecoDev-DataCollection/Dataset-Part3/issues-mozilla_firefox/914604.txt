So far, testing app installation was challenging as xpcshell doesn't allow to create a mozbrowser frame... But thanks to some tweaks made to mochitest, like bug 894990, we should be able to write a mochitest against the webapps actor and test all its features!

I haven't got a review for bug 914633, but receive positive feedback, so hopefully this patch won't have any other modification due to its dependencies.

I would like to land this patch in FF26 in order to finally have good unit tests for the app actor!

I would call that start(), but up to you.

Adressed comments and removed redirects test

I fixed review comments, but also had to remove redirects test that triggers an assertion.
I'll open a bug to investigate that in a followup.

You're doing great work adding tests and features to SpecialPowers.
But instead of using SpecialPowers.addPermission, you should use SpecialPowers.pushPermissions, which automatically removes the permissions when the test file is done (similar to pushPrefEnv).

+  function() {
+    ok(true, "all done!\n");
+    SpecialPowers.popPrefEnv(finish);

This shouldn't be necessary, as prefs would be automatically be undone after the test file has been run with pushPrefEnv. When you would test it standalone, there is bug 914890, when that bug is fixed, it would also be fixed for standalone tests.
This needed build peer review...

Oops, this patch already landed but we forgot to flag a build peer during review.

Mike, could you do a buildwise review?

Please remove this boilerplate, and the rules.mk include.
