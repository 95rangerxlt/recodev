Builds with places disabled still have some places-specific code.

Some things I noticed:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/base/content/browser.xul#47 (<?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://browser/content/places/places.css" causes a warning message in a debug build; that file is also referred to from other XUL files)

Places-specific CSS rules:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/base/content/browser.css
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css

ifdef places style rules

Patch is based off of a cvs-blame examination of the files mentioned in comment #0.  I did a quick lxr examination of other occurrences of "places" and nothing else jumped out at me as needing to be removed.
Patch landed on trunk and branch.  This *should* be everything.  Re-open if other places code is found.
Although winstripe's preprocessed, browser/themes/pinstripe/browser/browser.css isn't, so your ifdef there isn't working.

the last checkin for this caused bug 342061
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
