I think the two files
chrome://help/locale/help-toc.rdf , chrome://help/locale/welcome.xhtml
should be moved to
chrome://browser/locale/help/help-toc.rdf chrome://browser/locale/help/welcome.xhtml

chrome URI adjustments

In patch for toolkit, nc:base attribute doesn't work in my environment. So
links are written in full chrome URI.

I'll ask for review to Zbigniew Braniecki, the first-reviewer of Bug 289555
attachment #180730.

I don't think so. 'welcome.xhtml' and its related files should be shared by any
Toolkit apps. That's why we move other .xhtml files to browser and help viewer
contents to toolkit. See also Bug 289555.
