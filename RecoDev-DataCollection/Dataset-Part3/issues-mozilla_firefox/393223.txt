when clearing history, some apis do not check for EXPIRE_NEVER annotations.

also, per seth:

sspitzerMsgMe: EXPIRE_WEEKS might be expiring too early
sspitzerMsgMe: (need proof before I log a bug)
sspitzerMsgMe: here's how I found it:
sspitzerMsgMe: if you want to try out my wip patch for preview for bookmarks
sspitzerMsgMe: it currently uses EXPIRE_WEEKS (trying that out, not sure ifthat is correct for preview images)
sspitzerMsgMe: and on start up today, preview images from last night were gone.

wip

tests + patch for part of this.

however, i haven't yet reproduced seth's comment.

also: the msec/usec part of the patch is not yet resolved. changing that does not affect whether or not the tests pass. which indicates there's a problem somewhere else in the code, or in the tests.

patch

without this patch, I saw that I was expiring the screen shot annotations after 43 minutes (30 days / 1000).

note, without the patch, the new unit tests will fail.

fix part 2

this fixes the first part of the initial comment, wherein EXPIRE_NEVER annos can be orphaned when moz_places records are deleted.
fix checked in.

thanks to dietrich for spotting the msec/usec part (sorry for not spotting it back in bug #319455 comment #24)

fix part 2

dietrich is going to fix a couple small things and attach this to bug #393472
the first part of the initial comment has been spun off to bug #393472

this bug is fixed.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
