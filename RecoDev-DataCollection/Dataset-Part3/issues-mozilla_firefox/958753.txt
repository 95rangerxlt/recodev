As a developer, I would like to be able to connect my mobile device running Firefox OS via USB and see it show up in the app manager without having to take additional steps at the command line or by running any external utilities. 

Acceptance Criteria:
- When a developer attaches a mobile phone running FireFox OS to his/her computer via USB, the device should show up automatically in the App manager on a list of available devices.

Paul, I am sure there are several bugs in the system related to the ADB work, let me know what they are and I can setup the dependencies to this user story.
