Windows Vista/7(Aero) Arrow Panel Design
I'm against it. Aero Basic isn't using Aero Glass borders anywhere in the system, so why in Firefox?
I think this is a general problem with arrow panels, not just doorhanger notifications. To fix this, we need a patch to make the arrow panel border non-transparent, then the patch from bug 577928 should take care of the rest of the aero doorhanger styling.
It's not clear what's left to do here -- probably stuff that's already tracked in other bugs.
My bad, I wasn't clear enough. Sorry for that.
