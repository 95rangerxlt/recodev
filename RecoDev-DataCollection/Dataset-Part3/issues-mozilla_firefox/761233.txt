Ubuntu features an option to change font sizes for the entire system. The HTML tree in the Inspector tool does not respect this option.

I assume this problem is valid on other Linux distributions as well, perhaps even Mac and Windows systems - if we hard code font sizes in our UI.

As far as I know you are working on a new HTML panel. Please consider this bug when working on the styling of the HTML panel. Thank you!
Is this still true?
IIRC the new markup view from Dave fixed this issue. At least on my system the font size is correct.
