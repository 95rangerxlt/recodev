I was going to say that mano might have fixed this when he fixed bug #381218, but you're running a build with his fix.
Oh sorry. I missed that update to 0520 build. Now work. thx :) 
thanks modex.  I think mano fixed this issue as part of bug #381218:

-        if (column.hidden)
+        if (!column.hidden)
           menuitem.setAttribute("checked", "true");

marking as fixed.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
