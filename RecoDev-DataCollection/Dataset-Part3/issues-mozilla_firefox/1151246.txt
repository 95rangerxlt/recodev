Yes this uses two loops, but usually around what, 10 ticks? I think splitting these up is fine.

Review of attachment 8590025:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There's duplicated and unused code in both functions now. (e.g. computing a label, drawing the header background twice etc.).

We should only have a single function for drawing the tick lines. And another single function for drawing the header background and numbers (and maybe the lines again, only for the header, if we really want to; I'd say this isn't very important).

Let's share some code between these two methods and avoid dead variables.

"This is used for scrolling the visualization." -- a little bit misleading. Not for, but when.
