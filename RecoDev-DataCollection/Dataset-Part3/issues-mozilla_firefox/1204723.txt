React PR submitted: https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/pull/218
and merged: https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/commit/55593099293dba676435cd49910d8c90c66fb1f8

Ember PR submitted: https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/470

Both of these add-ons were only using files we already shimmed, so they would have continued to work anyway.  The changes just avoid printing migration warnings once those are on (after bug 1204127).

I'll keep this open for now, in case we change to resource://devtools in bug 1203159.  Also, we may find more add-ons to assist.
