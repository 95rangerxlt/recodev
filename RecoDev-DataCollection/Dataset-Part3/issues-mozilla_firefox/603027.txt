TEST-START | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js
TEST-PASS | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js | Notification should exist
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js | Secondary actions should exist (always/never remember)
TEST-PASS | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js | Notification should exist
TEST-PASS | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js | Secondary actions shouldn't exist (always/never remember)
TEST-INFO | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js | Console message:
TEST-INFO | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_geoprompt.js | Test took 0.389s to complete

Followed a browser_privatebrowsing_forgetthissite.js timeout, but that times out constantly so I'd be surprised if it was fallout from that leaving something in an unexpected state.

This is a dupe of bug 597029.  What has happened here is that browser_privatebrowsing_forgetthissite.js has failed in its second run, after turning PB on, which causes the geoprompt test to start in the private browsing mode, and this failure is an exact outcome from that.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 597029 ***
Fortunately, registerCleanupFunction() exists for that very reason! Which is the bug on adding one for the dangerous-when-timed-out privatebrowsing tests?

Good idea.  -> bug 603632.
