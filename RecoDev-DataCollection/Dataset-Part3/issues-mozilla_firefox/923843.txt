child of the toolbox. I need sleep. :|
Gijs, can we expect a fix for this soon? (I think that would involve moving the indicator thingy somewhere else entirely, because it really shouldn't be a child of the toolbox.)

Need to back out the offending patch otherwise. This isn't the kind of regression we want to tolerate on central.

If you tell me where you would like this instead of the toolbox, I can get you a patch today. I felt the toolbox was logical, seeing as that's where the button is...

I also, still, don't understand what the point of the :last-child part of the selector is.

#mainPopupSet?

I haven't looked and don't know it offhand. It might indeed be something to fix, but still toolboxes should only contain toolbars. Breaking this assumption could be a problem for various code dealing with toolbars, like toolbar customization code.

fix styling by moving the downloads animation element out of the toolbox,

A quick test seems to have this work fine.
