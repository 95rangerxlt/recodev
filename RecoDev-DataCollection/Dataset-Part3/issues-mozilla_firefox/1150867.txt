I decided it's ok to bitrot bug 1147702, I'll just update the patch there.

I was able to keep this patch minimal by %including browser-aero.css into browser.css, but eventually we should merge browser-aero.css into browser.css and move each rule from the end of the file to a place where it makes the most sense.

>    margin-left: 22px; /* additional space for Aero Snap */

Nit: I'd prefer it if the XP case was before this one, but obviously that doesn't work because CSS order-of-rules-is-important-ness. Given that, can you update this comment to "need some space for Aero snap" and add another one below to say something like "need less space on XP because there's no Aero snap" or whatever?
