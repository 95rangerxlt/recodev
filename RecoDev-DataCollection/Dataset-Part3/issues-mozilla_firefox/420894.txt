The title says it all, right? Otherwise, here's a longer summary:

"New Bookmark", "New Folder" and "New Separator" should be greyed/grayed out in the context menu of saved search folder items.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the Library, do a search.
2. Save the search in the bookmarks toolbar or on the bookmarks menu.
3. Click the saved search folder and then right click one of the items in the folder.
Actual Results:  
"New Bookmark", "New Folder" and "New Separator" look as if they can be selected.

Expected Results:  
"New Bookmark", "New Folder" and "New Separator" should be greyed out/disabled.

If you select "New Bookmark" you do get the New Bookmark dialogue and you can save a bookmark, but (obviously) it doesn't end up in the saved search folder. (And it shouldn't.)

Similarly you can click "New Folder" and get the New Folder dialogue. But again, the folder isn't placed in the saved search folder. (And it shouldn't be.)

Clicking the "New Separator" does nothing. The saved search folder remains open, and if you open the context menu again the three "New" items will be greyed out.

and they are now, WFM
That's odd. With the latest nightly, they are not greyed out for me.
that's true i've also filled a dupe of this today :\

since we have done some context cleanup. should this block?
Doesn't block, no, but we'd take a non-invasive patch.

This patch modifies the canInsert function in controller.js to disable the New... and Paste options when the parent node is a query.

However, this alone is not enough to fix the case for a query with no results, as pictured in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=317320 The patch additionally disables context menus on (Empty) menu items, where the parent is a  query.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
