In an actor throws an exception, protocol.js catches it and passes a packet like this:

    {
      error: "unknownError",
      message: ex.message
    }

And then in the client, the promise was resolved like this:

    if (packet.error) reject(packet.error);

Which means that we lose everything there is to know about the original exception. This change passes on the error message, which is particularly useful to GCLI which doesn't then have to have some magic to work out what might have gone wrong.

Clean on try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=6d98639e8e78
Doesn't seems to throw up the false +ves that the previous patch did

Noticed while checking recent changes that rev 65ae48644b2e seem to be a no-op ('message' is not used anywhere). Something must be missing from the patch, probably
-        deferred.reject(packet.error);
+        deferred.reject(message);

Thanks Sami, well spotted.
Panos, this also removes the 'Protocol error' part in GCLI.
