Steps to reproduce:

I have a JSON file on my web server where I've enabled gzip compression. To confirm this was working, in Chrome I requested the file with dev tools opened. In the Network panel, I could correctly see the smaller size being sent as well as the 'native' size. I then tried it in Firefox.


Actual results:

In Firefox, i was getting a smaller size being sent over the wire, so it worked, but the actual *size* was random, almost as if my web server was randomly changing the file before it zipped it. However, Chrome always reported a consistent size of zipped content.


Expected results:

A consistent size for the zipped content.

We've made some changes to the size reporting recently.  If you test this issue in Nightly 45, do you still see the problem?

Could I access the JSON file to reproduce the problem on my machine?

Honza
Nightly 45 does *not* show the problem, so it looks fixed to me.
Great, let's call it fixed then, possibly by bug 937586.
Feel free to re-open if you see the issue again.
