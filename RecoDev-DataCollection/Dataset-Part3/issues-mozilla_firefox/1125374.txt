I saw the other methods using |parent._childCount| instead of modifying the query... Let me know if that's what you think we should do.
which test is that one?
Cause I'm not sure we have so compelling use-cases to fetch the last bookmark in a folder...
Ah, yeah I thought that might have been a conscious decision to leave it out.

browser/components/places/tests/unit/test_browserGlue_smartBookmarks.js is using it quite a lot.
I'm not thrilled by having to support a further input option, but looks like some code might find this useful, for example when we append a bookmark to a view the current code uses getIdForItemAt with DEFAULT_INDEX. so for porting code to the new API it might be useful.

You cannot use _childCount here cause we don't fetch info about the parent for this API call. Nor you can use the _childCount in the query cause it refers to the currently fetched bookmark.

Though, what you can do is changing the expression in the query to

AND b.position = IFNULL(:index, (SELECT count(*) - 1 FROM moz_bookmarks WHERE parent = p.id))

and then as param pass

index: info.index == this.DEFAULT_INDEX ? null : info.index

apart changing the query, the patch looks good.

as I said, you can use the suggested query.
