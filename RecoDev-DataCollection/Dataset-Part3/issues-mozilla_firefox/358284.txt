Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061025 Firefox/2.0

Running Firefox 2.0, self-compiled, fresh profile.

Right-clicking anywhere gives me a very large context menu, obviously containing all options - no matter where I click. I.e. options for frames, images, background images, spellcheck etc. are there even though I clicked an empty area.

The problem persists even if I restart FF in Safe Mode. None of the previous versions I built (last: 1.5.0.7) had that problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Firefox 2
2. right-click anywhere

Actual Results:  
large context menu appears

Expected Results:  
context menu should be context-sensitive

I just noticed there is output in the Error Console every time the context menu opens:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsIInterfaceRequestor.getInterface]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: anonymous :: line 4395"  data: no]

Hope that helps.
Did you build with --enable-plaintext-editor-only? If so, this is the Firefox-equivalent of bug 354976.

> Did you build with --enable-plaintext-editor-only?

Yes, I did. I had that option in my .mozconfig since I don't know when. What will I lose or gain if I deactivate it? configure --help is not very helpful here.

In any case, I will rebuilt without that option now and report the results then. For now, thank you for the hint.
After rebuilding successfully, I can now verify that that very option caused the problem - now the context menu is "context sensitive" again and there is no output in the Error Console. Decide yourself if this needs a fix - I'm happy with it either way. :-) Still I'd like to know what the option is actually meant to do.
As I understand it, --enable-plaintext-editor-only only build the parts of editor/ that are needed for <textfield>- and <input>-like things, but not composer; e.g a page with designMode on.

It seems like the logic around here is flawed: http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js&rev=1.726&mark=4697-4700#4694 . nsIEditingSession only gets built if composer is enabled. Isn't there another way to tell if we're in an "editable" field?
OK, I was wrong. We cover the case enabling the context menu in a <textarea> or <input> elsewhere. The code I cited is just for designMode documents, so I think we should put it in a try/catch block as suggested in bug 354976.

I built with --enable-plaintext-editor-only and verified that my patch does indeed fix the bug.

Please only put the try around the editingSession stuff, and use a boolean initialized to false for the check, that way any exceptions thrown by the other code don't get silently caught.

*sigh*. I should've realized that |editingSession| was used later on. :\
