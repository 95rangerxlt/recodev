Collect and ship all ready l10n builds for Firefox 1.0.4.  Use this bug as a
tracking bug for pending localizations, as well.

1. Test builds found in
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates/.
 New builds will appear there soon.

2. Build sign offs in this bug should be of the form:

     <locale> ready for staging

   Example: for cs-CZ:

     cs-CZ ready for staging

   If the locale isn't ready to ship, then note so by saying:

     <locale> not ready for staging

3. Each locale should have sign off on its builds only by their locale owner.

This is the first release where pa-IN has a request to be made live.  In cases
like these MoFo's QA team will take a look at the locale's files to provide
sign-off internally.  I've initiated that process.  Once they've provided
sign-off I will make the files live.  If they find any issues with the builds
expect a bug to be filed in order to track them to resolution.

ga-IE, mk-MK, sv-SE, sq-AL, zh-CN made live.  Thanks!
According to http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all.html the following
l10ns are still offering pre-1.0.4 versions:

- af-ZA (1.0.1 !!!)
- ast-ES (1.0.3)
- he-IL (1.0.3)

Additionally, Lithuanian, Slovak and Welsh are marked as "not yet available"
(and have been marked that way for past few releases). I think these three
should be removed from the list until the localized builds are available.

CC'ing ast-ES, he-IL and sk-SK owners/peers.
the hebrew version needs an RTL theme, which i updated and repackaged the
installer. the firefox 1.0.4 hebrew is currently available on the mozilla hebrew
website. once i finish the version for linux, i will send a request to upload
the files to mozilla ftp.
ast-ES ready for staging
Thanks
af-ZA ready for staging

Sorry for delay and thanks!

No, we do a round of QA and trademarks review on the actual builds on top of that.
It proved to be a good idea.
