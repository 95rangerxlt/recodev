Combined screenshot: font discrepancy

The Developer Tools use at least 3 different monospace font families for code/monospace text. See the attached screenshot for an example in Firefox 24 on OSX, with a funky-looking user-defined font for web page text (that's font number 2 in the screenshot).

I’d argue that using a single font family makes more design sense.
Also, users might be puzzled if their pref for monospace fonts (from “Preferences > Content > Fonts & Colors > Monospace”) that usually apply to Web content also alter the Devtools UI. (Although the source view in FF has always done that.)

Combined screenshot: font discrepancy no more?

After updating to FF 25.0a2, I’m only seeing 2 fonts instead of 3.
- Console: seems to be using the system default (looks like Menlo in my case).
- Inspector, Debugger, Style Editor: seem to be using the user pref (with a fixed size in Inspector, and the user-defined size in Debugger and Style Editor).

It might still be a good thing to use the same font (from the same source) in Console and the other tools.

Use "devtools-monospace" class in all tools, increase monospace size on OS X

This patch makes devtools use only one monospace font. Any element that had a monospace font now gets the "devtools-monospace" class. I didn't touch the source editor, the two fonts happen to be in sync right now though.

In addition, the CSS autocomplete popup now uses a monospace font.

The monospace font size was increased a bit on OS X, after many (a ton) of complaints about it being too small. It was decreased a bit on Linux. It looks on par with the source editor now.
