Patch V 1

Modified the code to include the header file "nsIDOMNode.h" in nsAccessibleTreeWalker.h file to fix the compilation error.
This never landed, setting back to UNCONFIRMED.
Could anybody confirm the bug?
I've no idea.

But nsAccessibleTreeWalker.cpp includes nsAccessNode.h,
nsAccessNode.h includes nsCoreUtils.h,
nsCoreUtils.h includes nsIDOMNode.h

I don't know why it produces this error, and why the patch can fix it.
worksforme?
WFM for now.

Shallen, please add a comment if you don't agree.
I do not agree because,

When I compile on AIX, it gives me the error - 

"../../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h", line 187.30: 1540-0408 (S) The base
class "nsIDOMNode" is declared but not defined.
"../../../dist/include/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.h", line 187.7: 1540-0700 (I) The
previous message was produced while processing "class
nsDerivedSafe<nsIDOMNode>".

The patch posted above does fix the compilation error.

Requesting to land the same.

Thanks,
Shailendra
Perhaps the sequence is a matter for your compiler.

Nit: Put nsIDOMNode.h above nsIDOMNodeList.h.

Will land when the tree turns green.

Patch V 2

Placed nsIDOMNode.h above nsIDOMNodeList.h.
Pushed on Shailen's behalf in changeset:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ae4292c3c6ac
Thanks for the patch!
I still do not see this patch in the latest trunk build.
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/ae4292c3c6ac/accessible/src/base/nsAccessibleTreeWalker.h#l48
Note that trunk no longer means CVS HEAD (or Fx3.0) in common usage, it means the mozilla-central repository (whatever comes after 3.5).
The tinderbox build that I download shows the version as 3.0.11pre

Can you please let me know when the mozilla-central repository changes be available for tinderbox builds ?
