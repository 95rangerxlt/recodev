View of crunched Firefox in mulitple device display on OSX

When a user has multiple displays open and Firefox opens with an edge of the browser off the edge of one of the displays, the view pane collapses in a way that is not obvious to the user.  

The only way to undo the collapse is for the user to click-drag the bottom of the browser down.  This may not be obvious to some users.

Issue has been resolved.  Multi-monitor does not collapse Firefox now.
