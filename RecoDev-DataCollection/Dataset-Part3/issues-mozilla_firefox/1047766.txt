Hi,

I recently set up a new Linux computer with Firefox v32.0 Beta 64-bit, locally installed to a folder in $HOME/bin

After installing FireFTP, I am unable to access the "Create an account/Quick Connect" dropdown list (no accounts are set up yet)

The following error message pops up when you click on the dropdown list:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: chrome://fireftp/content/accountManager.xul
Line Number 216, Column 17:                <menu label="&charsetMenuMore1.label;" accesskey="&charsetMenuMore1.accesskey;" datasources="rdf:charset-menu" ref="NC:BrowserMore1CharsetMenuRoot">
----------------^

(note: there are three lines in the error: "XML...", "Location...", and "Line number...")

My setup:

i7-4790K Haswell Refreshed
nVidia GeForce GTX 660
Slackware Linux 14.1 64-bit
Firefox v32.0 Beta 64-bit (locally installed to a folder in $HOME/bin)

Thank you!

There is no title on the popup.
I'll take a look.
I recently had to install LinuxMint due to some new hardware. While Slackware switched to the ESR track some time ago, Mint offers the Release track. Again I installed the 64-bit Beta track locally in the same way I did under Slackware.

The same problem with FireFTP happens on v32

-HOWEVER-

There are no errors if I newly-created account under Release v31. Then I am able to use the newly-created account under both Release v31 and Beta v32.

Now that I am able to work with the dropdown box in Beta v32, attempting to select "Create an account" results in the error message. This is also true of "QuickConnect", though after trying to use "QuickConnect" the option grays out in the list after the first attempt. (None of this applies to Release v31)
