Pretty sure this is a dupe.
btw: changing the description to a label fixed this for me.

Gavin, they do look to me like they are different bugs and changing the description to a label fixed this for me.
Kind of reminds me of bug 345572/bug 349098, but those involve checkboxes.

I'm quite sure this is the same as Bug 345572. Changing the description to a label fixes this for me.

I'm going to try a different approach in Bug 394299.
Fixed by the checkin of bug 394299
Which makes this a dupe of that.

They are actually different bugs that had some overlap which is why I resolved them the way I did and I didn't submit two patches because they were fairly trivial to fix
