For Firefox 4.0, eBay has requested that we update the search plugin included as a default. The the updates add suggested search, an updated favicon, and the search URI to cut the current number of redirects from the initial search query from 4 to 1. This change affects the locales below, and should hardblock Fx4. This bug will serve as a tracking bug for all the individual locales.

just a note that fi and hu are NOT dependencies, so the correct locale list is:

Hey kev - ETA for getting all the stuff put in all the places?
I've put everything in, just need things to land. I'll sync with sethb.
Did sethb have a better ETA here? Looks like a lot of the dependent bugs are still unresolved?
This feels like it's lingering. Kev/Seth - anything my team can do to help, here? I know it's just a drop-in fix, but I'd like to clear the hardblocker list and this is one of the last ones.
I've jumped in and resolved the bugs that were good, with or without the type fix.

Only one remaining is en-GB, that just landed yesterday, AFAICT, and can use some verification in the nightly still.
I saw those, Axel - thanks a bunch!
all dependencies are resolved. can we resolve this? or pull the blocking flags?
I'll verify the en-GB stuff now, and resolve this once done.
en-GB looks good, going to resolve this as fixed.
Thanks kev!
