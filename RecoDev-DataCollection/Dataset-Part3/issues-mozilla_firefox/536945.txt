Looks good and fixes the mouseover performance issues for me completely.

>+        row = this.container.childNodes.item(Math.floor(++i / this._columns));

Out of curiosity, why .item() and not []?
I thought [] would complain if the index was >= the length, but apparently it doesn't.

It should be a strict JavaScript warning. (e.g. document.createElement('label').childNodes[0])
I get the warning here:
> document.createElement('label').childNodes[0]

but not here:
> var foo = document.createElement('label').childNodes[0]

Can you please file a layout bug, ideally with a testcase, on the slow-performance situation this worked around?  It's not clear to me why display:block should be causing problems here.
