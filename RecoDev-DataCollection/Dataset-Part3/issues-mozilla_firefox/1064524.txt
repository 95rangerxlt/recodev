Mockups and Flow for the forget button.

Forget Button - Mockups and Flow — i01

Awesome!
Two remaining questions:
- Is five minutes the right default?
- Should the time choice be reset to the default after forgetting?

That's not clear. In the "panic" sense, I think shorter is probably better. Covers the primary use case and mitigates some of the inevitable data loss.

> - Should the time choice be reset to the default after forgetting?

My inclination is to say yes in case someone sets it to "All day" and forgets to set it back. You can always run it again if it doesn't clear enough.
I will file some follow-ups for more detailed specs and assets.

Both sounds good to me!

Can you CC me on those, please? And to what extent do you believe that will/needs to block implementation?

Will do. I don't think it should block at all, unless you feel you need something specific to get started.

I'm in favor of a fairly short interval for the smallest option -- I think it's helpful for the "oops I shouldn't have clocked that link" kind of case. Too long and you the user has to decide between clearing out their "oops" and losing history they wanted to keep.

  Forget the last: All day 

sounds a bit clumsy to me in English.

would 

  Forget the last: Day

be better, and more consistent with the two other time frames?

And with those combinations of strings and patterns of 

  Forget the last: 5 min./Two Hours/Day

we might have problems in localizations where the linguistics for past, present and future tense, and time and counting systems are expressed in more complicated ways than we tend to be familiar with in English.

I'd suggest something like:

  Forget everything in the last: 5 Minutes/2 Hours/Day

But I'll let our experts with more experience in this area weigh in.
one other comment on choice of words that we should condider, or just provide localization notes about.

In the radio button action section we use the word "Forget"
In the explanation section below we mostly use the word "Delete" and "Close"
and in the confirmation dialog we use the word "cleared"

all to talk about the same action on browsing history.  

Would it make sense to use the same word(s) for consistency across these three areas?  

Also, were other words like "erase" considered and rejected?

A bit of explanation around the choice of each of these words will help localizers maintain consistency in translation and help the right meaning get conveyed.
I find the concept of "day" extremely vague: what does "All Day" actually mean? Today (i.e. 2 AM = last 2 hours), or "last 24 hours"? In the first case I would simply use "Day".

I'm not sure if these specs are final, but note also that letter case for "All Day" is inconsistent with the other 2 options. Same issue with "Open a new clean Window".

Expect those 3 options to blow up in size (especially in the Australis menu), since some locales might have to move "last" to the option for grammar reasons (match adjective to noun):

Forget:
* last 5 minutes
* last 2 hours
* last day/today

And also the last 4 explanations after "Proceding will:" (nit: typo) most probably won't fit on one line like English.

The code currently clears history up until the most recent midnight. So 2am means the last 2 hours, while 11pm means the last 11 hours.

Personally I find that this is confusing to people, and would prefer just doing the last 24 hours.

Gah! Should have written "while 11pm means the last 23 hours".

Yeah, I think that would be more clear if it's possible. The options are really supposed to be "very recent history, a little more history, a lot of history" we just need specific times for those.

If we stay with the current implimentation then maybe this sounds right

Forget:
* last 5 minutes
* last 2 hours
* since midnight

If we change to something more deterministic it sounds like

Forget:
* last 5 minutes
* last 2 hours
* last 24 hours

If doing last 24 hours is possible at this stage, that's pretty safe. A hypothesis that a lot of questionable surfing happens at night, so a session that spans 10 PM - 1 AM is two days and wouldn't be cleared by existing code.

Another possible way to handle it is to use the day name in the menu options

Forget:
* last 5 minutes
* last 2 hours
* Thursday

That's a bit more clear than saying "Today", because we're at least giving you a clue that if it's 12:05 AM, some of your surfing happened *yesterday*

We went with doing the last 24 hours.
