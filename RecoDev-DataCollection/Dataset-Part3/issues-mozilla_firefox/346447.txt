If you "open in tabs" a live bookmark or a folder, it replaces tabs that are already loading tabs, even when it shouldn't

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.change loadFolderAndReplace to false
2.Load a live bookmark
3.While loading, open another one


Actual Results:  
Tabs that are still loading are relpaced

Expected Results:  
loading tabs shouldn't be replaced
