This is a quick 'before I forget'

In these 2 cases, what we want to use is `this._target.isLocalTab`. Also, while you're at it, in `_getHostTab`, if it's not a tab target, we should not return the selected tab, but throw an exception (this should never happen. window and remote tab can't have HostTab).

I know we have batted this around a lot, but I'm not sure that isLocalTab is right yet. Is the question that we want to ask really - "Is this something that a typical web user might want to debug?"
Isn't this is a concept that we're missing from remote connections?

I'm not going to fix it here, but maybe we need isSystem or similar to reflect the concept of 'not for typical users'.

So I went further and removed _getHostTab. Also I added the profiler to the list of things that needed updating.
