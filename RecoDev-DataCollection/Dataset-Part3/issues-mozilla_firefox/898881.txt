Huh, reading code like rebuildPopupDynamic (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#307), I can't see why this would not be appearing.

Ehsan, is there any reason we should restrict adding opensearch plugins in private windows?
Yes, this was done in bug 577685.
I was unaware of bug 577685. It appears to be in conflict with the final comments of bug 566010. Specifically, other permanent modifications to Firefox are permitted, e.g. bookmarks, add-ons, browser upgrades. Also, I can add a search plugin using javascript from within a web page (e.g. Mycroft).

Considering that functionality is permitted, can we re-enable the auto-discovery of search engines in Private Browsing mode?
I don't feel very strongly about this.  What about you, Gavin?
The restriction does seem pretty arbitrary, and I don't see any reason to differ from the bookmarks behavior, so I think we should remove it.
