patch without the progress meter

at pch's request
oh, it should be noted that I didn't actually test that, since I couldn't get
firebird to build correctly. It's not like there's much that can go wrong though.
fix checked in
There seems to be a problem with this patch. Trying to bring up Page Info in
Firebird now gives an XML error on line 197 of pageInfo.xul. Specifically,
there's a typo in that label="&linkAccesskey;" should be
label="&linksAccesskey;" (note the plural "links"). It's not clear to me the
purpose of this column in the first place, however, as I don't have SeaMonkey
installed to compare to.
doh, I forgot a file :P. Thanks for catching that.

missing hunk

it also seems that this set of changes got lost somewhere. The first hunk of
the patch is something Ben seems to have missed, and the second hunk removes
mention of the entities that had been removed from the dtd (because access keys
haven't really worked right)
Trunk users have been reporting XML errors in Page Info for a few days.  Are
there still files missing?
I checked it in. I need page info to work tommorrow.
Jesse: Yea, that was me. It's fixed now though. Were there any bugs filed? I
didn't see any.
I don't think any bugs were filed.
