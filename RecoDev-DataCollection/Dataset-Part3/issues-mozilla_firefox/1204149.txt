STR on Windows
1. Make Firefox full screen (F11)
2. Make some content (youtube video) full screen
3. Wait for the full screen notification to go away
4. Mouse to the top of the screen

Result: The Firefox title bar is displayed but the full screen notice is not.

Expected result: The full screen notice should be triggered (in addition to the Fx title bar) like it is when Firefox is in windowed mode.

Bug 1204149 - Fix entering DOM fullscreen in fullscreen mode for e10s.
Although there seems to be a perm-fail on JP test on Linux debug builds, I really don't believe that relates to this patch...
