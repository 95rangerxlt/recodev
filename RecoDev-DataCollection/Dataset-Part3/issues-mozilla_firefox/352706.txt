[pinstripe] left scroll inner arrow different than right tab inner arrow, need image with opacity built in

I am using opacity 0.65 / 1.0 as part of the fix for bug #352518

if I had a version of the right tab background image with the opacity built in, I could fix this!

I'm not absolutely sure if that's really what you need -- I've just decreased the whole image's opacity to .65.

Well, if it's going to make 2.0, it needs to do it soon...
I need some css to go with this.  patch coming.

seeking r/a mconnor.  note, pinstripe is not RTL friendly yet, so you are not going to see any rtl rules.
thanks to jay, dao and justin for stepping up and sending me the new image at the same time!

fixed.

thanks again to jay, dao and justin for the prompt help with the images.
