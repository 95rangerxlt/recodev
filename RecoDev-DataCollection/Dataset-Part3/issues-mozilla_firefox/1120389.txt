Line 500 in the preprocessed file is http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/bb8d6034f5f2/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#l508

This is from bug 1102937.

Blake, the case where we don't have an event object is when the user clicked the "Paste & Search" context menu item: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/bb8d6034f5f2/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#l819
Are we happy with this being recorded as "unknown" for telemetry?

Could we pass in a special event object to record it as a "paste" search?  (It looks like we could change http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/bb8d6034f5f2/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#l819 to say "BrowserSearch.searchBar.handleSearchCommand({type:'paste'})", and then check for that in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/bb8d6034f5f2/browser/components/search/content/search.xml#l476 without _too_ many code changesâ€¦)

We could, but I'm not sure it's easier than passing the real command event, and detecting that it was on a menuitem with the paste-and-search anonid.

Would you like to do this as a separate bug, or takeover this bug and do it here?
I'm kind of swamped.  Could I ask you to pass the real command event, and detect it was on the paste-and-search menu item?

I guess I'll file another bug then (and probably mark it as mentored), as it's not directly related; just the way to reproduce this bug. We still need to support the aEvent parameter being undefined, as add-ons could be using it.
