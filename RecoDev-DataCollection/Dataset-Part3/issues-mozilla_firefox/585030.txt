we have a few terms and strings that we're wondering about localizablity. We'd like to have an actual review of the contents of inspector.js, inspector.properties, browser.dtd by the l10n team.

Reviewing all of browser.dtd doesn't sound in scope for this bug, do the entities in question stay out in any way? Also, where are they used?

Also, this would be much easier if "a few terms and strings" would be listed.
Takeover from bug 573102 (see comment 70: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=573102#c70) as requested by Gavin:

Some background: This bug is about implementing a panel that is used for inspecting JS objects. The object is displayed using a XUL tree. Screenshot is coming.

Axel, we don't need all of browser.dtd reviewed, just the "inspector" bits. 

Currently, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd#175 - 188.

We also have inspector.properties:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/inspector.properties

Feel free to ask for screenshots or descriptions as-needed.
I don't understand the strings in inspector.properties, which might indicate that the comments aren't good enough.

I don't know why those strings are not using the regular printf format?

LOCALIZATION NOTE (style.styleItemLabel:
should likely be
LOCALIZATION NOTE (style.styleItemLabel):

Also, why do I get these questions after landing?

Thanks. I picked that up in a subsequent bug (bug 561782).

I'm sure it was an oversight. We'll try to ask for your review during the review process.
I think this bug can be closed, right? Axel has been providing a lot of great feedback in the other bugs as we've landed specific parts of the Inspector. I'm not sure that there's any "general review" required here?
this feature has shipped.
