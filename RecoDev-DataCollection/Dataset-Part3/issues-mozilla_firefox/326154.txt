In the 1.0.x stream, we removed Yahoo search plugins from the mix (or never hard them).  We should add them (back), probably by merging in the ones from the Mozilla 1.8.0 branch.

I tried to commit this (and 326150) but wasn't able to, getting a "cvs commit: failed to create lock directory for `/l10n/mozilla/browser/locales/ja-JP/searchplugins' (/l10n/mozilla/browser/locales/ja-JP/searchplugins/#cvs.lock): Permission denied" error. Axel mentioned that this is probably because I don't have write access to the l10n repository. Can someone else with access land these two patches for me? Maybe cltbld (Coop)?.
