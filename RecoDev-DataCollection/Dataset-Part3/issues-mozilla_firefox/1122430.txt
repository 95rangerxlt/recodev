In the ctrlTab.suspendGUI method (https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cac6192956ab/browser/base/content/browser-ctrlTab.js#l399), instead of:

Array.forEach(x, function (y) {
  ...
}, this);

we can do:

for (let y of x) {
  ...
}

This is a little hard to tell. When modifying something in browser/base/, running all tests in browser/base/content/test/general/ or even browser/base/content/test/ is generally a good idea.
Hi,
Is the patch is good? Working
is yes then what should i do next.
Since you already ran tests, we can just add the checkin-needed keyword.

It means that the patch lands on one of our integration branches (and would eventually be merged to mozilla-central).

> and i don't know how to add

I already did it along with comment 8. The "Keywords" field is almost at the top of this page.
