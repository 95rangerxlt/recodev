* toolbarbutton-badge-container doesn't exist, it's called toolbarbutton-badge-stack now
* feed-button isn't a menu button as far as I can see
* back-button and forward-button don't have badges
* by always setting badged-button on PanelUI-menu-button, we don't need the selector to cover the case of that button not having that class (app.update.badge=false)

Hmm, I hadn't realized that app.update.badge was false by default in release builds. In that case I guess we shouldn't make that change since it would make the button needlessly complex for those builds?
