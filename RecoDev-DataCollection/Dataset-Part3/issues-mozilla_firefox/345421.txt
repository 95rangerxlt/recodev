So? That is pretty common practise. Because it is unsigned, it will wrap around to the highest number possible in the number of bits available.
Probably creates an annoying warning though. At least we should cast it.

Thanks, that was my mistake.
Aaron, should we use const instead of #define ?


Probably, I just used #define out of old C habits. Ming Gao, check in with const, no review necessary.
