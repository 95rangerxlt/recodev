Bugzilla's dashboard seems to have just noticed this stale review request, odd.

However, it appears that this work (and a wee bit more) was actually handled in bug 869191, but when committed referred to this bug. Can't change Hg, so let's call this the FIXED bug, and I'll dupe over in the other direction instead. :(
