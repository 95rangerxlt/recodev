Due to Vista compatibility we need to set system wide defaults during install if the previous install is for a side by side install or the existing install location. This will allow getting to a known good state by just running the installer. Patch coming up.

fixed on the branch.
Verified fixed for 1.8.1.2

I`ve done some tests with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a3pre) Gecko/2007020704 Minefield/3.0a3pre running as default browser and then a new download and install of Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/2007020804 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre

1.8.1.2 was set to default after the installation, like expected.
