When I open the option dialog from the start menu, right clicking on firefox
icon and press a button which should open another dialog ( ex 'view Cookies' )
those dialogs don't open.
It doesn't metter if firefox is open or not.

Firefox is added to the startmenu because it is my default browser. I supose the
menu is not visible when it is in the most commonly used list or in 'all
programs' part of the menu

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Start
2. Right click on firefox icon
3. Choose 'Firefox Options'
4. Press a button which opens an other dialog (ex 'View Cookies')
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
A dialog should open where you can view your cookies

How you start Firefox shouldn't have anything to do with this... can you
reproduce this with a clean profile?
I can confirm this with a blank profile.

Not all sub-windows fail, but those that do seem to be those calling openWindow
(http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/content/widgets/preferences.xml#845).

Even the JavaScript options extension is affected here.

How you open Firefox is exactly what causes this bug :). Opening the prefs
dialog by right clicking the start menu shortcut is the same as |firefox.exe
-preferences|.

Indeed, if the options dialog is opened via the start menu, there is no
"window.parent", so it fails if instantApply isn't enabled.

Patch

This patch makes it fall back to opening with the prefwindow when the window
opener is non-existant or closed.

Patch

we should look into taking the patch for this 1.8b5 blocking bug if we can
verify that things work now on the trunk.
Fixed on trunk. Leaving open till branch checkin.

Please resolve bugs when you land them on the trunk. Without that status, the
bug won't get QA Verification attention and we don't want to take fixes until
they've been verified on the trunk. The approval request is enough to keep this
bug alive even after being verified on the trunk.
Ok, wasnt sure of the process.
