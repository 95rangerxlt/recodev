As of tonight's nightly, when pressing the Panorama button ("Group your tabs"), nothing seems to happen. On closing and reopening Firefox, the Panorama tab appears, allowing changing of tab group, only to have the button stop working again.

Jose, do you see any errors in the console?
seeing this too. wondering if it is related to some osx-theme change, tab-overflow seems broken and title-bar colors are wrong too.
Yes, should be caused by bug 838855. Affects Mac OS X, only.
Tim, nothing on the console that would be related. At the same time I saw this for the first time, I also saw a glitch on the first pinned tab. It was shifted to the left and appeared cut. That glitch I had seen before, about a week or so ago. It might be all related to themes/tab-overflow.

That's bug 837486.

It's generally a good idea to track different symptoms separately, so they can be verified/reopened independently should the initial diagnosis be wrong for whatever reason.
(also because someone filing a bug about panorama being broken isn't going to find "ele is null", but they would find this bug)
Bug 838855 has been fixed \o/.
