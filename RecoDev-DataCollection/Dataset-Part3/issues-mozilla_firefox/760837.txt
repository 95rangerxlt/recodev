I'm leaving this open because Mihai mentioned that he wanted to fix the test for real.  Close if you decide otherwise please Mihai.

test fix - rebased

This is the test fix that I'd like us to land after the aurora merge.

Yep, the plan seems solid. I suppose you could move it even further up if we ever get another similar failure.

[in-fx-team] test fix - improvements

The previous patch had no failures after many runs on the try server, but ultimately I was able to reproduce failures on my machine.

I had to make more changes, this is the patch I ended up with. No more failures on my machine.

Try push looks green again:

You probably want a space before pageLoaded inside the string literal.

Thank you Panos. I fixed that in the patch I landed.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc4abc6cf76d
While looking into the failure from bug 802390 comment 18, I noticed that the commented subtest-numbering was off in this test, dating back to the cset in comment 15 / comment 16.  That test modified the numbering in such a way as to skip 13, so when the harness reports issues in tests #13 #14 and #15, those correspond to the chunks labeled as #14 #15 and #16 in the test file.

Anyway, I just fixed the numbering in the test:

Thank you Daniel. Yes, numbering was off for quite some time...
