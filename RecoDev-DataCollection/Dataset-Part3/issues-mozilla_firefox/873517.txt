Steps to reproduce:

I clicked the downloads icon.


Actual results:

The downloads icon vanished, but the button was seemingly still functional. "Show all downloads" was still displayed.


Expected results:

The icon should have been 'highlighted' for a moment before displaying the 'box' with "Show all downloads".

didnt' we drop support for iconsize="small"?
If so, this rule should just be removed. Please verify that with Jared.

At that point, you could probably drop the 'toolbar[iconsize="large"] > hbox' part and replace it with just

toolbar > hbox >

if not that at that point this rule would not apply when you drag the button to the bookmarks toolbar or to the tabbar... did you test that?

At this point, I think what you really want is just:

#downloads-indicator[customizableui-areatype="toolbar"]

that should also work in the overflow area...

I was already confused when I couldn't find a flag for small icons anywhere. Didn't check about:config (yet) though...

Marco, thanks for the suggestions! I implemented those, including the removal of iconsize="small" support. I still have to ask Jared about this, when he wakes up.

nit: const naming convention is usually kAreaType or AREA_TYPE
IRC transcript re small icons mode:

[15:57:54] <mikedeboer> mconley: do you know if we removed small icon mode support for linux?
[15:58:12] <mconley> mikedeboer: we've technically removed small icon support everywhere
[15:58:26] <mikedeboer> mconley: not practically?
[15:58:28] <mconley> mikedeboer: but the Linux icon story is a bit of a mess right now because of lack of gfx assets
[15:58:40] <mconley> mikedeboer: I think there's leftover shrapnel in there - haven't looked closely
[15:59:09] <mconley> lack of gfx assets and lack of a plan for dealing with crazy Linux themes
[15:59:10] <mikedeboer> mconley: ok, but there's no way users can choose to have small icons anymore, right?
[15:59:15] <mconley> mikedeboer: correct.
