For the sync migration, UX calls for us to open about:accounts with the email address set to a specific value.  ie, we will find the email address specified in the current legacy-sync setup, then open about:accounts such that it defaults to creating an account with this address.  The user will still be able to change the value - it's just a suggestion.

cc zaach as I suspect this will require a change to about:accounts *and* to the back-end.

Adding myself to cc list, since I suspect that jbonacci and I will be splitting the testing duty for this feature.
Flagging as diamond. Zaach, feel like mentoring this if somebody wants to pick it up?
I've opened a content-server issue here: https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/issues/1258

I assume this will work similar to force auth, where the browser appends an "email=" query parameter to the URL.
I am taking the content server portion of this.
The server portion of this is ready. You can open the sign up page with an email query parameter, i.e. `/signup?email=<email-to-prefill>`.

I assume we'd use this for all legacy-sync users who would visit about:accounts. Are there more UX details for someone interested in writing the about:accounts patch?
Thanks Zach/Shane. The client side of this patch currently depends on other bugs (likely bug 1019985), but once we tackle those this should be more straightforward.

Forward URL params from about: URI to remote URL

This cleans up URL param handling and in the process fixes this bug, if I understand it right.  All URL params except for "action" from the about: URI are forwarded on to the remote page, including "email".  So you can open about:account?email=foo@foo.com and it'll fill in the email address.

I don't know why wrapper.init try-caught constructing the URL and setting the iframe src.  Bug 913199 seems to be where this was introduced, but I didn't see a reason.  I wouldn't expect that to throw, so I removed it.

If this looks OK, I'll move on to tests next.

Forward URL params from about: URI to remote URL + tests

This is the same as the previous but has two new tests.  They seem kind of redundant since the existing tests hit these paths...  And an end-to-end test that makes sure the email param is copied to the text field in the page would be nice, but I don't think that's possible.  Or should our automated tests use the test servers from bug 1014411?

While end-to-end tests would be ideal, I think the test coverage is OK as it stands.

I think this switch statement is going to cause you merge issues due to bug 1079835, but I'll let you use your judgement how to resolve that.

Indeed, here's an unbitrotted patch that still uses the switch statement and accommodates bug 1079835.  Carrying forward the r+.

Setting for Tracy. We'll pick it up if we have the time.
I see this bug has automated tests, is there need for manual testing? If so can you please offer some guidance? Thanks
Thanks Bogdan, I think this is well covered by the automated test and my own and others' manual testing in the past.
