www.bungie.net loads fine for me with the official 20050321 build, but with a
later beast build it hangs whilst loading, then firefox can crash out.
I suspect bug 282754 may have caused this regression. The website may not be the
best coded one in the world, but firefox shouldn't hang/crash because of it.

Yes, I agree about the regression. It would be easy to wallpaper but we need a
reduced test case to figure out the correct fix. What's happening is that we're
calling nsHTMLScrollFrame::GetContentInsertionFrame and it crashes because the
scrollbox's scrolled frame is null. That's really weird. And this is inside a
call to GetAbsoluteContainingBlock from the block-in-inline part of ConstructInline.

The real problem is that GetContentInsertionFrame gets called before we're done
hooking up the frame tree. We don't really need to call
GetContentInsertionFrame here.

Adding topcrash info for tracking.  This is a regression and topcrasher on the
Trunk that started on 3/22. I'll keep an eye on Talkback data after teh patch
goes in to verify that this crash goes away.

Here is a link to all current crashes:
