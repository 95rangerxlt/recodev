Fix tooltip not showing in style editor
Thanks! One problem:

This causes movement when hovering over the filenames. The filenames jump up when you mouse over them. Not sure why, but we'll want to fix that.

Fix tooltip not showing in style editor

Cancelling review on this patch because the text jumping issue has to be fixed before we can land this.

Thanks for the patch.

There's no jumping now, but the "Save" label is always showing now on every style sheet. It should only show upon hovering the stylesheet, like before.
