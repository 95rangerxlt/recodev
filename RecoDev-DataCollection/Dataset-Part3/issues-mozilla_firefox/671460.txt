You're removing the test!

Also, can you please explain the refactoring logic?  The patch is really hard to read.

No, I'm only removing the extra .html file because that is now embedded in the test (it's really few html so I figured we don't need the extra file).

So the former approach was to close the tab, wait for the onDOMWillOpenModalDialog event and then check periodically (using setTimeout) if there's a dialog shown.

I refactored the patch to not use setTimeout() anymore but use the WindowMediator.onOpenWindow event to wait for the modal dialog to be shown. Besides that I now use some convenience functions like showTabView() and the like.

Sorry for not being a bit more communicative about the changes. I'll try to be next time to make it easier for you to review.

Ah, OK.  Please in the future use file_bugNNNNNN.html for such files, the name starting with "test_" confused me.  :-)
