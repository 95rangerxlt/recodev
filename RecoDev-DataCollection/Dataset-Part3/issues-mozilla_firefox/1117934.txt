+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1106104 +++

We want to re-enable e10s for testing on Nightly after the next uplift to keep the bug reports and feedback flowing in.

We'll also want to bump the CURRENT_NOTICE_COUNT to display the notification bar so users know what's going on.
