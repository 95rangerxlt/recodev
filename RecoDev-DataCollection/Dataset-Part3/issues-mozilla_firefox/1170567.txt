Server config should mean we're not in an incredible hurry to do this straight away, but we should ideally do it by the end of this week so we don't randomly forget it and end up breaking beta things.

Tracked to make sure we don't forget.

back out upgrade changes for watershed aurora builds, rs=me,
rstrong, I think we would benefit from having some mechanism to force a whatsnew even when the version is not changing, and this patch gives us that on Aurora and Beta. The pref startup.homepage_override_url is "" there, although not on nightly.

What do you think of leaving this in, or adding some new code block just for OVERRIDE_NEW_BUILD_ID ?
I'm fine with leaving the code in but I really don't know the code in browser/components/nsBrowserContentHandler.js very well. Probably best to ask gavin.

We need this patch in, and the server config set, to show the whatsnew page. Ideally we'd wait until most users have a build later than 20150602163057, to catch the maximum audience. I don't know of anywhere to see that info that though.

But definitely should back it out before the beta -> release merge on June 22.
I'll put this on my list of things to check on before beta 5.
Comment #5 is incorrect. We can backout the patch at any time.
I've pushed the backout to Aurora:
