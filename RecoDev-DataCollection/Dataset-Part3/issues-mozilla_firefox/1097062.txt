As reported in Bug 1096430, the hamburger icon is too small in DevEdition: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8520029.
I did some research into why and it seemed to be a regression from 1080406, where there is a call to PanelUI.menuButton.classList.add("badged-button").  It's not clear to me why this is a problem only on DevEdition and not m-c.  Matteo, any ideas why the panel ui button is smaller in the DevEdition release?

Squashed badge

Thanks for filing this followup bug Brian.

Adding a screenshot showing that the badge icon appears somewhat squashed as well.
It's indeed a regression due the badged button class; the max-width for the badged button icon is 16px (see: mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.css#843) where in Australis the icons seems to be 18px.
We could easily increase the size, but we got some issue in the past with Australis and icons, so I want to double check why the width was added in first place, and if we can maybe get rid of it.

I noticed when disabling that rule that the loop icon also became a bit bigger, so it seems to be affecting other icons.  Because of that I would say we should only selectively disable the max width on the panel ui button just to limit scope of a change.  Although you could ping someone more familiar with the browser frontend to double check.

Oh, and I assume that it's not a problem on m-c because the button is only being badged in devedition?

Note that the loop icon is also squashed because of this bug. There was bug 1099952 filed about that.
This bug now affects Nightly as well.

It's not only smaller, the shrinking is noticeably happening on startup.
Did something change on Nightly? The hamburger icon no longer appears squashed.

Matteo, you mentioned that this may be handled in another bug.  Can you link to that bug and resolve this if necessary?
