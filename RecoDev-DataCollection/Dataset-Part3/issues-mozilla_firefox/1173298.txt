Looks good, would just like to see the test expanded to cover anonymous elements

You can also test an anonymous child by doing something like:

  <style type="text/css">
    #pseudo::before {
      content: "before";
    }
  </style>
  <div id="pseudo"><span></span></div>

  let pseudo = yield getNodeFront("#pseudo", inspector);
  let children = yield inspector.walker.children(pseudo);
  let before = children.nodes[0];

  // select node, check disabled state on button

We should have some additional styling for disabled .devtools-button elements that are just using an icon.  Can't tell by looking at it that it's disabled.   Maybe some opacity on devtools-button[disabled]::before... what do you think?

Added opacity: 0.5; for disabled buttons.
