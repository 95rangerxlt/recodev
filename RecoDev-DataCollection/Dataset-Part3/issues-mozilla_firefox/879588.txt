Screenshot shows Windows in high-contrast mode, where the selected tab has yellow text on a light-gray background.

Possibly an existing issue not new to Australis?

Note that this specific problem occurs because of the light coloured (white) lightweight theme so this is probably unlikely to happen in practice as a user wouldn't choose such a theme if they want high contrast. I suppose it's possible that a user with a light LWT turns on high contrast mode afterwards.

Why are we using a native text color (yellow in this case) on a lightweight theme background?

That seems like the issue that needs to be fixed. That isn't intentional AFAIK.
taking this to Australis M7
This seems pretty edge-casey, so I think we shouldn't mark this as a blocker.
It's this rule's fault:

This doesn't make sense to me. The problem shows on selected tabs, and that rule is for non-selected tabs, right? Or am I misreading this?

The problem is on selected tabs because that selector excludes them.

Err, text-shadow:inherit is still needed on OS X :/

I have to confess that I don't understand why this text-shadow rule had to go, too, in the context of this patch. If it's cleanup and/or the existing rule is unnecessary, can you explain how/why it is unnecessary?
The lwt text-shadow comes from global.css and is already inherited. The custom text-shadow you're looking at tried to accommodate to the selected tab being excluded in the color:inherit rule on Windows (i.e. this bug).

Fab, thanks for explaining. LGTM, then!
