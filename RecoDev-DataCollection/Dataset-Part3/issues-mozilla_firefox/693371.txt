Did the merge, fixed the induced bustage, but there is still a failing unit test I'm investigating.

Console output from hanging test

The test_breakpoint-01.js test hangs as can be seen in this console output. The reason is that the eval source script is received with the live property undefined, instead of true (or even false). I'm still trying to figure out which recent change broke this.

Working patch

The problem was that Debugger.Script no longer exposes a "live" property, because all scripts are live by default. With this patch the merge works fine.
