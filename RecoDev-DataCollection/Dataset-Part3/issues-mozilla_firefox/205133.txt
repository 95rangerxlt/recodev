Confirmed using Firebird/2003-05-09.
possibly related to bug 204640
I believe this is actually being caused by the TabBrowser Extension
http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions.html.en

I installed build 20030511 and Open in Tabs worked fine.  I installed
TabBrowser, restarted, and Open in Tabs died.  Disabled TabBrowser, restarted,
and Open in Tabs works again.
As a postscript: I went back to the 20030429 build which had not been a problem,
and as soon as I installed TabBrowser, Open in Tabs died.

TabBrowser has had a couple of revisions posted in the last few days.  Probably
something broke in them since my old version of TabBrowser worked fine in the
20030429 build.
If you open a folder on the bookmark toolbar and click "open in tabs", it does
work as expected. The problem is only in the bookmarks menu in the main menubar.
FWIW I've never had the tabbed browser extension installed.
"The problem is only in the bookmarks menu in the main menubar."

This is what my previous 2 comments refer to.
Open in tabs sometimes disappears from bookmark drop-down menu. Restarting app
solves the problem.
Open in Tabs works just fine here with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; en-US;
rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030511 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

Recommending WORKSFORME.
Simon, this bug is _Mac OS X_ specific.
Kenji, I was aware of that. I just wanted to add, that indeed this is a
mac-specific thing (perhaps Linux, too), since this does not occur on Windows. 

BTW Comments from people using different OSs are quite common here.
This bug is present in Linux as well: Mozilla Firebird 0.6 with Tabbrowser
Extensions installed 17 May 2003. 
Bertilo, can you test this without Tabbrowser Extensions, please?
Bug is present in Mozilla Firebird 0.6 for Windows as well. However, it does
appear that it's the Tabbrowser Extensions that is at fault. Open in tabs works
when disabling the extension, but does not when it is enabled. 
Build:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030515 Mozilla
Firebird/0.6
Tested on W2K 19. May 2003.
Sorry. I mistook the "Open in Tabs" for "Open in Tabs" menuitem in the context
menu of bookmarks, and found the cause of the problem.
I'll fix this in the next build.
piro: this bug is _Mac OS X_ specific.
This is nothing to do with your TBE problem.
