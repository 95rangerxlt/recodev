r=me with the isSpecialToolbarItem function fixed. On a sidenote, it would be nice if we had tests for this... :)

The IDs of special items are unique, so this won't work. http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm#931 checks to see if the ID _startsWith_ those values.
For example, I put a separator in my toolbar on Firefox 25:
> document.getElementById("nav-bar").childNodes[7].id
> /*
> separator13868236745522

Yes, this is totally true - but I'm not iterating by node IDs. I'm iterating the split currentset from the toolbar and iterating the individual springs.

Here's the currentset from a toolbar that has some special items:

spacer,spring,spacer,personal-bookmarks,paste-button,separator
Ah, yes that makes sense. Sorry for my confusion. Carry on here :)

No problem at all.

Yeah, totally. :/ Had a need-for-speed on these probes, which meant I couldn't spend time writing tests. Now that I'm reaching the end of the must-land-on-Aurora probes, I can start writing the tests. I have a bug open for that (bug 944481). Thanks for the review!
