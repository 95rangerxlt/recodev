I enter my log-in details and press "login".  The url changes to http://www.exetel.com.au/# but that's all that happens.  I can log in using Flock and Konqueror.  Both open https://www.exetel.com.au/members/home.php  I have the NoScript extension installed in Firefox but script is allowed for the "exetel.com.au" domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.You have to be a customer of the site
2.Enter your customer details
3.Press "login"
Actual Results:  
Url in location bar changed by the addition of '#' from 'http://www.exetel.com.au/' to 'http://www.exetel.com.au/#'

Expected Results:  
It should have loaded the page https://www.exetel.com.au/members/home.php

In case it is of some use, I have asked the owner of the website whether it is possible to obtain some dummy account details for further testing.

The owner of the site will not provide a dummy account.  There should be some response to the button even if no correct log-in details are provided.
The log in on this page is now working.  The issue is resolved.
