Because the responsive mode is mostly use for mobile development, it would be better if the device size related media queries use the page size.

Patch v1 - PART 1 (media query)

Boris,

In the DevTools menu, there's a tool named "Responsive Design View". In this view, we want the *-device-* media queries to use the page size, not the actual device dimensions.

At first I wanted to attach the `deviceSizeIsPageSize` to presShell or presContext, but they get destroyed a bit too often (reload or if the browser is display:none). That's why I used the docShell.

Not for this patch, but perhaps ResponsiveUIManager should be responsible for doing next-tick?

screen.width doesn't use the page width. I need to fix that.

Alex, can you tell me if that fixes the simulator issues?
I'm wondering if this is the best strategy. What about iframes in this window?

We want the iframes to:
- not use the actual device size
- not use their page size as the device size
- use their parent size as the device size

>+  attribute boolean deviceSizeIsPageSize;

Mark this as [infallible], please.

>+    docShell->GetDeviceSizeIsPageSize(&isDeviceSizePageSize);

And then this can become:

 return docShell->GetDeviceSizeIsPageSize();

What causes the media query to be reevaluated when deviceSizeIsPageSize is set on the docshell?  r- for this part, unless I'm just being blind.

>+nsScreen::IsDeviceSizePageSize()

I think this should look more like so:

  nsPIDOMWindow* owner = GetOwner();
  if (owner) {
    nsIDocShell* docShell = owner->GetDocShell();
    if (docShell) {
      return docShell->GetDeviceSizeIsPageSize();
    }
  }
  return false;

r=me with that

Addressed comments. I use:

to reevaluate the media query.

r=me, but a test for the media query being properly reevaluated dynamically might be nice.

We need to rev the docshell IID here, right?

Ok. And does this have anything to do with the NS_ERROR_XPC_CANT_MODIFY_PROP_ON_WN exception?

This should fix issue 2.

It might if for some reason the interface change wasn't picked up in the packaged XPT... and I vaguely recall that iid bumps can be related to that issue somehow.

addendum - allow deviceSizeIsPageSize default value to be set via a preference

We want this behavior to be the default behavior in B2G. Instead of dynamically changing deviceSizeIsPageSize in all the docshells, it's easier to just use a pref for the initial value.
