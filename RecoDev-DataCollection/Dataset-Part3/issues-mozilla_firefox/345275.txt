+  enum { eAction_Select=0, eAction_Click=0 };
Why are two actions defined to be 0 in the same interface?

enum { eNo_Action=0, eSingle_Action=1, eDouble_Action=2 };
Can you remove those? It makes no sense to use those for something just returning the number of actions. Not sure why I allowed that in :) That's as bad as defining TWO=2 :)

patch v2

A couple of issues that aaron can answer better than I can:

>+  enum { eAction_ShowLongDescription=1 }; 
I happened to notice a trailing space on this line! I was also wondering wheter we should space out around the = sign. But what I was really wondering is whether something should be returning 2 actions for GetNumActions.

>-    *_retval = eDouble_Action;

>+    *_retval = 1;
I've no idea what module style is but I would have used ?: here.
