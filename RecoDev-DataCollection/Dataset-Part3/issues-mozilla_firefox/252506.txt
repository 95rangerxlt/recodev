seen with recent linux 0.9+ branch builds

-launch with a new profile
-take note of the icon in the Search Bar

Tested results: the old  (find)magnifying glass icon is present
note: the find here is broken; entering a word to find in page does nothing.

expected results: Google search(engine) icon should be default in the Search Bar.  
The find icon should be removed. This would then be the same as Windows and Mac.

Also note that selecting Google in the Search Bar makes the find icon go away
permanently.

recent changes to the search toolbar items (added several engines by default)
has fixed this.
