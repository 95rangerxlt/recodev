Since bug 246375, themes are no longer required to be whitelisted.

Unchecking the checkbox in the Web Features dialog also disables theme installs,
but only extensions need to be whitelisted.

Plugins are not affected by this at all. Also remove some redundant
information.

Am I too short on the concept of whitelisting? It's explained a few paragraphs
above in the popup blocker section.

>+  <p>To install themes, check this option. To install extensions, check this
>+    option and whitelist sites you want to allow.

This seems rather stilted to me.  Perhaps something like (tho not exactly like)
this:

When software installation is enabled, theme installation is also enabled from
any site.  Extensions are more powerful than themes, however, so you must add a
site to the whitelist to install its extensions.

> To add a site to the
>+    whitelist, click <em>Allowed Sites</em>, then enter the site you want to
>+    allow extension installs from and click <em>Allow</em>.</p>

On a scale of grammatical correctness this rates below ending a sentence with a
preposition, but ending a clause with a preposition is at the very least
sketchy.  Using "enter the site you want to allow to install extensions" would
solve this.

I don't really like the use of the word "whitelist" here.  Overall, I think
it's too technical to be used in Help.	I'd really prefer if you can eliminate
use of the word entirely in the patch, but if you can't I suppose we can make
that a new bug (definitely a todo before 1.0, I think) and just fix the
original issues here.

s/anyway/anyways/

Let's make "In order to do that" be "To do so" for the sake of brevity and
un-wordiness.  Also, change the rest of the sentence to read "click <em>Allowed
Sites</em>, enter the site name, and click <em>Allow</em>."  I think the
sentence is a run-on as it is in the patch.

>+    and themes. You will be prompted to confirm each installation in any case.
>+    Uncheck this option to completely disable extension and theme installation.
>+    </p>

I don't really the "You will be prompted..." sentence, personally.  What do you
think of:

(However, &brandShortName; will always ask you to confirm software
installations.)

>+  <p>Enabling this option is sufficient to install themes. Extensions are more
>+    powerful than themes, however, so you must explicitly allow a web site to
>+    install its extensions. In order to do that, click <em>Allowed Sites</em>,
>+    then enter the site and click <em>Allow</em>.</p>

Make the changes noted in nit #1 to the last sentence here.

r=me with the changes, asssuming you're okay with the suggestion for nit #2.
"anyway" per discussion with Jeff.
