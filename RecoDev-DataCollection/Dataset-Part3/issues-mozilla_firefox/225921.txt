Steps to reproduce:
1. Right click a personal toolbar item and select Copy.
2. Paste into a text editor.

Result: whatever was on your clipboard before step 2 is pasted.
Expected: the URL of the bookmark should be pasted.

This is a regression:
works: 2003-10-11
broken: 2003-10-14
broken: 2003-11-16

(Testing copying bookmarks elsewhere in 11/16: works for bookmarks in the
sidebar.  Does not work for bookmarks in menus.)

Yeah, broken for me, too. Win XP 20031105 Firebird/0.7+
-> 0.8
fixed on trunk, not yet on the branch
Pierre, I see this following problem in my build: when the content area is
focused (but not a textbox), Edit > Undo and Edit > Delete are enabled and these
operations seem to apply to the bookmarks bar, that is, Edit -> Delete starts
deleting stuff from the bar. This is a bad regression. Did this bug fix cause
this?  And is it already fixed? If not, can you please take a look?
Blake: on linux, I can reproduce it in one case: inserting a new folder in the
bookmarks toolbar or menubar menu.
Focus is screwed up by the new window.
In all cases, when I click on the content, the focus event triggers the update
of the enabled/disabled command state with the right controller (content), and
the items in the Edit menu are correctly disabled.
Please, tell me in which other cases you see the problem so that we can fix them
quickly for 0.8.
the modal dialog was indeed interfering with the focus, and was confusing the
command controllers.
fixed.
Blake, feel free to reopen if you still see pb like that.
fixed on branch
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
