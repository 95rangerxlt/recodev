hardcode min- and maxVersion

This is similar to what we did for Firefox 2, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/locales/generic/install.rdf#57, we should set the minVersion to 3.0 and the maxVersion to 3.0.*.

This change is zero risk, as we're not shipping language packs, but is required for localizers to test their ongoing work against stable Firefox releases.

This is a branch-only fix for Firefox 3, without impact to our shipped builds.
Well, uh actually, we do ship the langpacks, though they're not linked from anywhere: http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.0/win32/xpi/
Duh, you could have just said that that doesn't make things risky here.

This fix is just as safe as the change we did for 2.0.0.x, which we're shipping for ages.
