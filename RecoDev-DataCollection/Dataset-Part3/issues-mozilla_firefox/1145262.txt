As part of a Q1 goal to being cleaning up the debugger some, let's start by making things more componentized and removing the globals. I think this might be pretty painless, but I could be wrong.

Renaming because I'm not going to do as much refactoring as I originally thought. The most important thing right now is to split up the views into separate files and change some of the global references to local where it's easy. There are still a bunch of global variables but that's ok for now.

This basically just splits up debugger-panes.js into multiple files (1 per view). I'd like to also do this to debugger-toolbar.js.

It's a lot more files, which is annoying because of jar.mn, but I find it a whole lot easier to navigate and we can start treating each view more modularly so they are easier to improve individually.
Previously I wanted to re-use our module system but that requires a bunch of refactoring to pass window/document instances around. It pains me that we don't have modules yet, but this is a really good start at least.
victor, I'm going on PTO for the rest of the week but it would be nice to land this when I get back, as it will bitrot quickly. if you have time!

also forgot to add strict mode to the new files. I'm going to post another patch which breaks up debugger-toolbar.js in a similar fashion.

Victor, don't worry if you can't get to these this week. I can get Eddy to take a look next week.

Note that these are only incremental restructurings, it feels a little weird how we are passing DebuggerView and DebuggerController instances around but this is just a first step towards making dependencies more explicit. Please keep in mind this a first step. Landing things in pieces is the only way this will work.

Looks like a mechanical change to me.

I thought I had done a try push, but I can't find it anymore, so here's a new one: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=0700aea454ec
Green try, let's try to get it checked in!
Needs rebasing.
