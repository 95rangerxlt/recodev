WIP patch v0.1

Mihai,
* I deleted the "+" and "*" from jar.mn files because I think they are unneeded, what do you think?
* I deleted aero specific stuff because I don't think they are needed too. (aero herits from winstrip right?)
* What about files name?
Paul, I need tests on OSX/Windows, can you please run a try build with the patch?
Paul, try: -b do -e -p linux,macosx64,win32 -u mochitests -t none

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Patch looks good! As discussed on IRC, this patch needs an update for the winaero theme. The jar.mn file has two sections, one for aero. Please check and update the file as needed. Thank you!

readded the preprocessing directive to pinstripe's jar.mn file. Styles weren't applying there.
