I'm confused which patch this patch is based on. I thought it might be based on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=1123686&attachment=8551805, but I don't see the changes there to `setBreakpoint` here. Below you use `setBreakpointForActor` for example (in the old code, not looking at this patch's changed), where was the introduced?

Hard to parse this patch without the context of other work this was based on. Not sure if I'm just confused or what.

Which rev/commit is this based on? I don't see this on master: https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/master/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/script.js#L5470

Which rev/commit is this based on? Same comment here about logs. Also, you removed code that suffixes `code` with the source map.

Sorry about that. This patch should apply cleanly.

Ugh. Forgot to update the documentation for setBreakpoint as you requested.

Nick said he'd take a couple of these reviews since James is at ReactConf this week. Thanks Nick!

Can you make sure to generate patcehs with 8 lines of context (-U 8)?

I don't feel like I have enough to tell what's going on here, and don't want to swap back and forth between editor and splinter.

Hi Nick. Do you think you would be able to review this patch today? It's blocking me from landing the other patches you reviewed.
