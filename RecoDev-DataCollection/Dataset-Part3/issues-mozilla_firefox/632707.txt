For whatever reason, the landing of bug 632636 causes the mouse scroll wheel to change page zoom rather than scroll the page.

That was bug 593372, which Jim backed out.
OK.  Although, mine is a mouse on a PC -- not a touchpad on a laptop.

What's the best strategy here?  Should I make this blocking bug 593372 or simply resolve it fixed and reopen this if it regresses again?
Jim should comment on that.  I can guarantee that bug 632636 didn't affect mouse wheel behavior though :).
should be fixed by the backout of bug 593372.

s/should be/is/ - I was able to reproduce this and it's fixed now.
