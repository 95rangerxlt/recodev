432.pdf also failed to render the first few pages.

144 is OK for me.
432 doesn't render in Adobe Reader as well.

> 144 is OK for me.

Using FF 19.0 on WinXP, viewing/printing 144.pdf from URL is NOT OK; it's blurred and FF adds a lot of horizontal lines on characters which aren't in the original when viewed with adobe reader.

Similar to bug 811002.

For comparison with FF's blurry and twisted output as seen in attachment 720277, here's the same document as seen in adobe reader - much cleaner, no horizontal lines.
On Windows 7, I have the same result as you but it's as twisted and almost as blurry as it's in SumatraPDF, that is why I say OK.
