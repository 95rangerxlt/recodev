Tweak default preferences set in debug builds.

For me that would be:
  * Turning on window.dump's ou by default.
  * Turning off about:config's "be careful!" screen.
  * Turning js warnings on (showInConsole is already set).

The pref only applies to opt builds...
And of course if you use the same profile with opt and debug builds you then have to set these prefs in user.js to avoid losing them...
