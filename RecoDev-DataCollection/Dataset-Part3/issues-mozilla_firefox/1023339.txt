The hit area of some in-content preferences is a full block in width but should be limited to just the checkbox and it's label. 

Bug 1020422 took care of most of it, but there are still some that need fixing:

- for the Privacy tab ("Use custom settings for history" selected), the clickable area is a full block in width

- for the Advanced - Update, the clickable area is NOT limited to the checkbox and it's label

- for the Sync tab (when FxA account is connected), the clickable area is NOT limited to the checkbox and it's label

Mike, now that I have been granted editbug permissions, if I want to work on a bug can I just assign it to myself?

Totally! And congrats on getting editbugs. :) You should also think about getting Level 1 Commit Access (http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/). Let me know if you need any help with that (I can vouch for you, for example).
I'll check it out. Thank you!

rev1 - width of in-content preference elements fixed

This is a good start - but I'm noticing that we're crunching in the buttons for the privacy settings now:

Are you sure that vbox surrounding the privacy settings is required?
Sorry about that. 
Don't know how I haven't seen this.

I used that vbox because I did not find another way to align the buttons to the right without it.
Without the extra vbox their parent alignment is "start" and I can't get to align them.

I'll try to figure out another way to do it.

rev2 - width of in-content preference checkbox fixed (using hbox)

So I used hboxes instead and it worked nicelly. 
But I'm not sure it's a good practice.

No, it's not, unless you want to have extra elements in the same row.

1. <hbox><checkbox/></hbox>
+ Checkbox only consumes the minimum necessary width
- Checkbox cannot wrap on to the next line (potential l10n issue)
2. <hbox><checkbox flex="1"/></hbox>

So here I would suggest something like this:
<vbox class="indent">
  <vbox align="start">
    <checkbox id="privateBrowsingAutoStart" ... />
  </vbox>
  <vbox class="indent">
    <vbox align="start">
      <checkbox id="rememberHistory" ... />
      <checkbox id="rememberForms" ... />
    </vbox>

(Also the spacers were unnecessary as there wasn't anything on the other side to space away from the checkbox, unlike in the subsequent cases where there was a right-aligned button.)
Hm, I guess we both learned something today, rittme. Sorry if I led you down the wrong path.

Can you try Neil's suggestion to see if it works? If so, we can back-out this patch and land a new one.
