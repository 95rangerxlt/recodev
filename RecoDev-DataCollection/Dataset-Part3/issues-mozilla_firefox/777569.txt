Could you take a screenshot where there's no errors?

Patch

I looked at the pinstripe CSS but I'm not sure why it isn't happening on Mac (I didn't try it on Mac though).
Thanks Jared. Can you try to do that for Linux as well?
If not, I'll r+ this and file a new bug.

What is "that"?

The patch contains the same fix for Linux (although I didn't test it out).

I don't have my Mac with me right now so I can't test out why it previously worked on Mac.

Patch v2 (windows only)

This version of the patch only applies to Windows since the measurement isn't exactly correct on Linux.

On Mac the spacing is coming from the margin on the label and not spacing on the icon. Might be nice to make them consistent at some point ;)
Thanks for the review Stephen. I split out the linux bug to bug 781291.
