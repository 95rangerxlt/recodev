Video depicting the behaviour

With e10s enabled on recent nightly (98ea98c8191a) on hummingbird.net pages (e.g. https://hummingbird.me/anime; happens on other pages on that website too) scrollbar is drawn as a white rectangle instead, however the scrollbar is still fully functional (e.g. you can click and drag to scroll). Could not reproduce on other pages yet.

Nightly running in safe mode.

Is this really the same bug? Here scrollbar does not disappear, but is misrendered as a white block only.
I see what I think is the same problem on http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/ . The scrollbar looks ok at first, but after clicking on it to scroll down, all that is left is a whitish bar. It remains functional though.
I see this on http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html, although I'm not using e10s.
And now it's working for me in 2014-09-14 Nightly.
I canâ€™t reproduce it anymore either.
