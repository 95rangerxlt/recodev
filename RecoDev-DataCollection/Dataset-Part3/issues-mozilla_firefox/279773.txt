Found four issues.

1. nsNativeAppSupportOS2.cpp needs to be reported (Rich Walsh did that)
2. need some changes for commandline service (Rich Walsh did that)
3. Need a SHORT_LIBNAME for permissions.dll
4. GetWorkingDirectory wasn't working on OS/2.

Patches coming.

nsCommandLine changes needed by OS/2

adds platform-specific code to nsCommandLine::ResolveFile and defines
"cmdlines" as the SHORT_LIBNAME for the commandlines library

an alternative for GetWorkingDirectory Fix

a simpler way to fix OS/2-specific code in SpecialSystemDirectory.cpp (see
attachment 172354)
The startup code in nsCommandline.cpp & nsBrowserContentHandler.js produces
inconsistent results.  The first invocation of Firefox can successfully load a
file with a relative path.  Subsequent invocations fail unless the filename
specified on the commandline is fully-qualified.  I suspect, but can't confirm,
that this is an XP problem rather than OS/2-specific.  Should I open a new bug?

We need to get someone to verify that first.

I tried reproducing this using the Windows nightly from Jan 27th - no problems
there.  I'll keep investigating why it fails on OS/2.  Unfortunately, I don't
understand how nsBrowserContentHandler.js & nsDefaultCLH.js fit into the big
picture :-(

We should fix these all over the code :)
These patches are all in, so this is fixed.

Let's open another bug for the command line problem.
