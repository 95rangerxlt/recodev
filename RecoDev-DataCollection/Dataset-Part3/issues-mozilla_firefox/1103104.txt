Due to the way some providers have both title and text support in share, and twitter only has text support, text is only inserted into twitter share if the user has selected some text in the page.  Should examine providing page title if there is no text selection, but need to be careful to not duplicate title/text for other providers.  Something like this might work:

if selection-argument in shareurl and 
   title-argument not in shareurl and no selection
  selection = title

This change would be in OpenGraphBuilder.generateEndpointURL in Social.jsm.  Need to add something like:

if (p[1] == "text" && "%{title}".indexOf(queryString) < 0) {
  if (!pageData.text && pageData.title)
     query["text"] = pageData.title;
}

Can this be a good first / mentored bug with you as a mentor, Shane? :-)
I'm wondering if the code from Fennec could be used?
Very annoying the missing of the title page in the tweet :-/
