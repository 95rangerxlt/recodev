I'm using JQuery to embed an applet into a website, cf. attached test site.
Firefox 4 opens the page, the JS gets executed and the initial applet starting seems to work (you'd see the JVM incl. java-console starting up and the applet loading image is placed to the position where the applet should be).
But that's it. The applet does not get loaded.

Switching from <applet> to <object> doesn't help.

I tried the sample page on following browser successfully:
Opera/9.80 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X; U; de) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.63x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open sample webpage, cf. attachment test site.
Actual Results:  
The applet loading image is shown and the java console opens if enabled (i.e. a JVM seems to start).
But the applet does not get executed.

Expected Results:  
Applet starts, i.e. a ball bounces of the applet borders.
