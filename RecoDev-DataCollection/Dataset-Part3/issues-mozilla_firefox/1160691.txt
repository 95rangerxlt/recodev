bench.js

Here's the benchmark program I wrote.

The numbers:

parseLocation took 497 ms
parseLocationOld took 2343 ms
isContent took 367 ms
isContentOld took 1942 ms

Should add a header comment up here for the file saying why this is written the way it is (for performance reasons) and because it's very hot code, and list some of the speed up improvements with profiler data size

Tests for this patch, works on current frame stuff, so it should work once everything else is landed (may need to modify the argify function)

Good once everything else lands in bug 1154115 and give it a go on try with this test
wait this bench mark was for 1 000 000  and 5 000 000 "fn (http://...)" strings -- is that an accurate number of /unique/ frames, especially after deduping?

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: 1167252, the new performance tool
[User impact if declined]: Won't ship the performance tool
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: There are try pushes in Bug 1167252 with all patches needing uplift
[Risks and why]: Requesting uplift for the accumulated changes in the performance tool since the 40 merge date, so these changes haven't had the full 6 weeks to bake.  Risks are generally contained within devtools, specifically within the performance panel.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

Note: I had verbal confirmation for these uplifts from Sylvestre even before he's flagged them as a+.  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1167252#c26
