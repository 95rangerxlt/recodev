Whoops, this shouldn't have a border. -moz-appearance:none isn't enough, as it then just inherits a border.

Works fine if the window isn't maximized and isn't hard up against the right edge of the monitor. So, I'd say this is another issue caused by using a <xul:panel>.

Between this and bug 943759, which I believe is also caused by using <xul:panel>, I think we should consider the possibility of needing to revert back to using a <html:div>. Thoughts, Matt?
*sigh* Wrong bug, please ignore comment 2.
(And redirect any thoughts to bug 956162.)

Which platform did you see the bug on? I didn't see it on OS X.
I see the problem on Windows now.
Yea, was testing on Windows.
