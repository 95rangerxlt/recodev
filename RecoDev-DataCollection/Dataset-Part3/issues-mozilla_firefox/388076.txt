In the last few nightly builds the page icon and title on inactive tabs are positioned 1px too high.
This results in a rather annoying text-moving effect when switching to an inactive tab.

Reproducible: Always

I'm not sure this isn't intended.
I checked a 20070701 build and it acts the same
Looks like it's caused by this line:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/themes/winstripe/global/browser.css#117

If I delete the "margin-bottom: 1px" rule with DOMi, tab titles and icons stay put.

It seems strange, if this rule was intentional, that the close buttons don't move along with the rest of the tab face.
That's the same underlaying problem as in bug 369882.
