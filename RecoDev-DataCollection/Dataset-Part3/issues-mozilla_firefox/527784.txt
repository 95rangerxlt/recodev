patch - v1 (trunk/1.9.2)

A member of the Ubuntu Mozilla Team noticed that his sessions were no longer being restored, and he noticed the following error in his Error Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIXPCComponents_Utils.import]"  nsresult: "0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: delayedStartup :: line 3590"  data: no]

browser.js line 3590 is:
  Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm", NP);

When he went to resource://gre/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm, he got file not found. However, the file was under /usr/lib/firefox-3.7a1pre/modules/ along with distribution.js and openLocationLastURL.jsm.

Mook pointed out that such import code should probably be using resource://app/ instead of resource://gre/. Indeed, resource://app/modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm works just fine.

This patch modifies the file paths for all calls to distribution.js, NetworkPrioritizer.jsm, and openLocationLastURL.jsm.

Requesting blocking, as this currently makes session restore (at least) completley broken.

This also affects 1.9.1 because of private browsing's openLocationLastURL.jsm, though the same problems aren't seen.
resource:///modules/NetworkPrioritizer.jsm would work equally well

This is not required.

It's not required, no, but explicitly saying 'app' is way more clearer than wondering what /// means.

There are more places to change, then.

The only other place (that's not part of some test or comment) is http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/chrome/src/nsChromeRegistry.cpp#1140, which is:

NS_LITERAL_CSTRING("resource:///chrome/app-chrome.manifest"));

I could change that, I guess, but I was mostly caring about the three files under modules. Are you aware of any other places using resource:/// that actually matter?
browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.xul
and possibly chrome/public/nsIToolkitChromeRegistry.idl

You must be looking at older code. Trunk (mozilla-central) doesn't have resource:/// in either of those files.

The risk here is low - it can only affect builds where mGREDir != mXULAppDir, which isn't the case for stock Firefox (only affects firefox-on-xulrunner). In our builds, these URLs are all equivalent.

Given the benefit to distros and the lack of risk, I think we should take this for 1.9.1.6.
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/rev/1316e9a4b655
This is _so_ not a 1.9.1 blocker. These files can't have changed in forever on the 1.9.1 branch, how can it suddenly be a "blocking" issue the day of the code freeze?

Approved for 1.9.0.16, a=dveditz for release-drivers (for the next 6 or so hours until code-freeze, then it'll have to wait until next time).
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/672c7b2cf968
So, you've got unstarred (other than the ones we did wrongly out of confusion) test failures across all three branches, after your second set of pushes - do you have a plan?

Dan meant 1.9.1.6 here.

If the test failures were caused by this bug, please back out immediately.
Turns out that xpcshell doesn't implement resource://app/ like toolkit's nsXREDirProvider does, so just made everything use resource:///.

* Swap resource://app/ to resource:/// for all other import calls
Could it produce this error while trying to build trunk source code ?

It isn't clear how to replicate this problem on Ubuntu in order to test the fixed builds.

The problem can't be found in mozilla.org builds due to the lack of XULRunner use, so gre == app. Only Ubuntu (and related Linux distro) builds will exhibit this problem because of how they build XULRunner (gre) as a separate component and then run Firefox (app) on top of it (causing gre != app).
