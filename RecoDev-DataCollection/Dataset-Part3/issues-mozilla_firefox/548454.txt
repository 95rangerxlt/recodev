Build Identifier: Recent Minefield Build

A few weeks ago (I can't remember on which build this started happening), when Minefield updated itself, I started having this error. Once the update was installed and it prompted me to restart, I clicked but it did not restart, just close. From there, clicking on the shortcut would produce this error:

---------------------------
firefox.exe - Application Error
---------------------------
The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000056). Click OK to close the application. 
---------------------------
OK   
---------------------------

Reinstalling does fix the error, but every time it is updated this will occur again. Safe Mode has no effect. I have tried doing full reinstalls including trying a new profile, doing a registry clean, and installing to a different directory, none of which helps. The portable version shares this problem. There is no entry in the Event Log.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update Minefield.
2. Try to open it.
3.
Actual Results:  
Produces error 0xc0000056.

Expected Results:  
Opened updated Minefield.

I found the source of the problem. It seems that xul.dll gets corrupted, and when Minefield tries to update it cannot replace it, because it is undeleteable. This means all the other files are replaced except this one, but the xul.dll becomes obselete and produces the error. I try to delete it through Command Prompt and manually, but it does not let me, presumably because another application is using it. Turning off the anti-spyware and anti-virus does not have an effect. When booting in Safe Mode it is deleteable, however. I should mention that when newly installed xul.dll is deleteable, maybe it gets corrupted somewhere along the way.

Does anyone know what xul.dll's function is in Firefox? Perhaps this could help clear up the problem.
Seems to be fixed now.
