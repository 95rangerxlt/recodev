Could you provide a screenshot of what you mean, and how it differs to the correct styling?

OK done :)
oh crap, it didn't catch the hover effect.

Screenshot with hover effect
Oh, was this meant to just be about the hover effect?

Also, Mike, I could swear we had a bug about the buttons being mis-centered in the navbar, but I can't find it.
Well, the :active effect is also affected.
Also, I also found another bug, when the widget is in the panel menu, it will always have a bottom border, even when there's nothing after it.

That's by design.

I don't know of a bug for that, but this one will surely cover it. This looks wrong and needs to be fixed. I'll take a look!

Well, it looks quite awkward. It also misses a top border when there's no split widget before it btw.

Thanks ! I think the fix will be quite easy :) Changing the classes when the widget is in toolbar should be enough.

Patch 1: restore styling for buttons of wide widgets in toolbars

Gijs, you rightfully questioned the removal of the 'toolbarbutton-1' class for wide-widget buttons and bluntly insisted on removing them in bug 878065.

I was wrong!

So, while I like being right as much as the next person, part of your original justification was that there were rules for these buttons that interfered with what you were doing. Have you checked (cross-platform) that that isn't the case (anymore), as there doesn't seem to be anything in this patch to adjust e.g. specificity of certain rules?

Was this intentionally part of this patch?

Yeah, it interfered with the zoom-reset button label text vertical centering, but removing this className is a bit too blunt whereas a simple, more specific rule in osx/browser.css fixes it better.
I tested for any other possible regression on all platforms (linux, win, osx) for all positions (menu-panel, overflow-panel, nav-bar, any other toolbar).

Ehm, yeah, I'll remove this.

Yeah (see above). `:not(.overflowedItem)` also needs to be added, because wide widgets in the overflow-panel have the exact same appearance as in the menu-panel.

This one? Bug 940255
(That's about Cut/Copy/Paste though and also about the spacing inside the menu, so I doubt it's a dupe)

No, because that one is - like you said - all about menu panel. AFAIK we didn't find the bug Gijs thought he saw to date.

Sorry, well it is partially fixed, but the faint seperators still appear.
The faint separators as pictured here, http://screencast.com/t/A4JNR3TVOR, are intentional.

Why ? It doesn't seem consistent with the rest of the toolbar buttons. And don't also match shorlander specs.
The other toolbar buttons don't have them because they are not a logical group. Buttons that are logically grouped together have these splitters between them to show the connection between them.

Seems like people aren't talking about the same thing.

To be clear, button groups are supposed to have separators, but the separators in that image don't look right.

That's what I was trying to explain. The seperators should look like the one between the bookmark star and the bookmark menu icons.
Sorry, you are right. I filed bug 949151 to get this fixed.
