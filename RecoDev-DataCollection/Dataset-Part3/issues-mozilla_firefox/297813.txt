Using the firefox-1.0+.sv-SE.win32.installer.exe from latest-trunk-l10n/, the
install script for browser.xpi sets Windows registry keys with a "1.0+ (en-US)"
suffix. This is obviously wrong, but it does not seem to do any harm.

Are the locale name in these keys really necessary? Can it not just be removed?

chase, could you take a look?  possibly seen before we had locales building
properly in cvs?

Please keep me in the loop on any changes to config.it as I need to replicate
similar registry twiddling logic in the application update code (see bug 297147).
See also bug 297147 comment #2, where I describe possibly replacing the registry
setting done by the installer with that done by the update service.
Probably due to the fact that trunk localizations "repack" the en-US build.  We
have a self-imposed edict in build config not to touch browser.xpi during locale
repackaging.

If en-US is finding its way into some variable name that ends up in the
registry, we might be able to get around this by dropping the locale name from
that variable altogether.

Potentially related: bug 301702, bug 301815.
Without help I won't get to this until 8/9.  From what I've read here and my
understanding of the problem, it shouldn't block the branch.
So, if we remove the locale from the registry key, then we prevent people from
installing more than one locale of Firefox 1.5b on their system.  I suspect that
being able to install multiple locales is nice for testing purposes at the very
least.  Perhaps we should instead fix the installer to write the proper locale
to the registry.  The update code writes the proper locale FWIW.
Chase, I'll take this unless you've already got code.

Move all the registy/shortcut writing to ab-CD.jst

This just moves all the registry/shortcut code wholesale from browser.jst to
ab-CD.jst and it appears to do exactly what we want.
We need this fix for Thunderbird l10n builds, too.

Thanks for the pickup here, Ben.

excellent, sr=darin
When migrating this to Thunderbird, we should localize "Thunderbird &Options"
(which seems to be in the same resulting install.js in mail.xpi), too. This
string is used in windows start menu.
Fixed on trunk for 1.8b4. Please file a separate bug about tbird.
For Thunderbird have a look in the existing bug 301702
