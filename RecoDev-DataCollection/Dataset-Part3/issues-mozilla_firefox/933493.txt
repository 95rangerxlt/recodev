Steps to reproduce:

Open the dev-tools, compare the line-height in the Inspector and in the Style Editor (or Scratchpad).


Actual results:

The line height is different, I think a more spaced line height like in the Inspector is nice.


Expected results:

The line height should be equal

I don't see the issue. Could you please attach a screenshot ?
Inspector doesn't use the SourceEditor component to display its stuff so I can see how there might be differences. I'm not sure if this is an issue worth fixing though. And it definitely doesn't block CodeMirror meta bug.

Stephen, is this a big UX issue?

Screenshots (current on left, line-height: initial on right)

The Scratchpad on the left is what CodeMirror currently looks like. It's far too squished to be comfortable for me (if you look closely, you can see the underscore and bracket markers in the selected line aren't even inside the line highlight).

The line height is set by this rule:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/sourceeditor/codemirror/codemirror.css#105

If you remove that rule (or override it with line-height:initial) then you get the Scratchpad on the right, which I'm far more comfortable with (and which is much closer to what we had before CodeMirror landed).

Inconsistent line height

Screenshot, it says all.
This was fixed in bug 941643.
