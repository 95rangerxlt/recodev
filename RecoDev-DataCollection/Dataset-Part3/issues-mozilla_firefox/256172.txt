When I select both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web site only" from
"Web Features", favicons are not loaded in both location bar and tab.  In this
setting, Favicons should be loaded.  But, favicons are not loaded on Firefox and
Mozilla suite. 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto Firefox->Preferences...->Advanced.  Uncheck "Hide the tab bar when only
one website is open."
2. Goto Web Features.  Check both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web
site only".  Select OK button.
3. Quit and restart.
4. Visit the URL (http://www.mozilla.org/).
5. Favicons are not loaded in both location bar and tab.

Actual Results:  
When I select both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web site only",
favicons are not loaded.  But, uncheck "for the originating Web site only",
favicons are loaded.


Expected Results:  
When I select both "Load Images" and "for the originating Web site only",
favicons should be loaded.



I confirm this problem on 2004-08-05-09-trunk Firefox build(MacOSX10.2.8). 
Then, 2004-08-17-09-trunk still have this problem.  But, 2004-08-04-09-trunk
didn't have this problem.  And I confirm this problem on 2004-08-05-12-trunk
Firefox build(Linux gtk2+xft).  It seemed that this regression occurred between
20040804 and 20040805.

Please reopen this bug if y ou dont agree that this is a duplicate.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 253238 ***
Reopen this bug because I confirmed that this bug was regression by bug 253627.

I got the source of mozilla-2004-08-04-07-trunk and mozilla-2004-08-06-07-trunk.
 The source of 2004-08-04-07-trunk was not changed by bug 253627.  Then, I
restored the files which was changed by bug 253627 in the source of
2004-08-06-07-trunk. 

And I made gtk2+xft build which is based on the restored source of
2004-08-06-07-trunk on Linux(RedHat/Fedora).  Using this build(Mozilla
gtk2+xft), favicon is loaded when "Accept image that come from originating
server only" is selected.  But, Using 2004-08-06-03-trunk of official gtk2+xft
build, favicon is not loaded when "Accept image that come from originating
server only" is selected.

It is obvious that this problem is regression by fixed bug 253627 as described
above.

Folks, Is bug 253238 related to bug 253627(or bug 236889)?

All that happened in bug 253627 is that we started actually doing a security
check that we were not doing before.

If that check is failing when it should not, then either the caller is not
passing in the right info or the wallet code is blocking things it should not
(for example, the same-origin check should probably allow chrome to load things
from any site).

Good-looking polish fix for  aviary?
You may want to check for resource: too...
I made gtk2+xft build which was based on the patched source of
2004-08-31-07-trunk.  Using this build, favicon is loaded when "Accept images
that come from the originating server only" is selected.  It seems that the
patch works fine.  I change Firefox into Browser at the status of product
because this patch should be applied to both Mozilla suite and Firefox.

Can someone explain why minor fixes like this are still being landed on Aviary/1.7?
Especially because this is a fix for a regression that, as far as I can tell
from Bugzilla, has never existed on those branches?
OK, it turns out that bug 253627 did land on Aviary, there's just no Bugzilla
record of its approval and landing. Nor can I see why it needed to land,
although that may be just because no-one bothered to mention it. Sigh. Fine, go
ahead here.
Correct, this did not land on Aviary. I was right the first time. This is a fix
for a regression that was never on the branches. So, clearing approvals.

Can only remove the obsolete flag in the product where it was set. sorry for
the spam.
Reopen this bug.  I confirmed this bug on 2005-01-03-06-trunk of Mozilla suite
(MacOSX10.2.8).  2004-12-16-06-trunk already had this bug.  But,
2004-12-15-06-trunk didn't have this bug.  This regression occurred between
20041215 and 20041216.  It seemed that this regression was caused by bug 240070.
 Checkin range is roughly:

confirming - allowing images "for the originating web site only" breaks
favicons, using a 31st December Firefox trunk build on Win2000.

ported patch

attachment 157503 ported to permission extension
I made mozilla-gtk2+xft build which was based on the patched source of
2005-01-13-05-trunk(on Fedora Core 3).  Using this build, favicon loaded when
"Accept images that come from the originating server only" selected.  It seems
that the patch(attachment 171127) fixed this bug.  But, initial setting of
"Image Acceptance Policy" still breaks.  Before 2004-12-15-06-trunk, radio
button of "Accept all images" was selected at "Image Acceptance Policy" by
default.  I sent no reports about it because "patch v1"(attachment 157503) fixed
the problem of initial setting on Sep. 2004.  I have reported about it as bug
279782.
patch checked in.
