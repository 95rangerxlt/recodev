The location and search bar are not "themed" like they are on branch. They're still natively themed.

Hrm... looking at dbaron's screenshot in this blog post [0], it looks like they are in his build. I remember Myk saying something about needing to clobber to get these changes to be picked up...

Hrm, i didn't sync gmomestripe.
I see this in my build too (they are still native), though I haven't clobbered so if Adam's recollection in comment 2 is correct, that would be it.

Tested this on winstripe, looks fine, but I notice that there's no hover effect like on the branch.
I will file a bug on the hover issue.
