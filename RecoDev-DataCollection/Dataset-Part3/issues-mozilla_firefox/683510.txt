Prototype console/close console/filter commands
There is already a 'console clear' command: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/file/15c2cf2f47f4/browser/devtools/webconsole/GcliCommands.jsm#l99

But we should probably add 'console close' and 'console filter' commands too.
what do you think of a command to change the console's position?

I think we should do it.
Moving GCLI bugs to Developer Tools: Console. Filter on 'baked beans are off'.
Joe, we don't use [good first bug] anymore, but [mentor=...][lang=...]. In this case, I think you want to flag your bug [mentor=joe][lang=js].
