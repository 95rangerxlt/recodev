I have a page that loads xml and displays it.
Now the windows is empty but the source shows valid xml.
and some pages show xml without the tags.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load xml-document

Actual Results:  
Empty window.

Expected Results:  
Xml prettyprint should have been anabled to show me xml.

I have livehttp and adblock installed.

Has bug 259206 regressed again causing XML prettyprint to break again? If so, we
need to dupe this and reopen that. If not, then prettyprint is broken for some
other reason. This is the same testcase as bug 259206.
Works for me with 2005-02-28 trunk build of Mozilla, so Firefox only.
Works in 2005-02-20 build.
Doesn't work in 2005-02-21 build.
Maybe this is a regression from fixing bug 279768?
I don't think it's my fault. I did not touch prettyprint in between 2005-02-19
and 2005-02-22. 

Maybe bug 282792 - bryner did touch PrettyPrint there.

But I'll hold it on my radar and check it once more.

CC'ing bryner
also, anything I could touch (prettyprint.dtd in fact) wasn't touched yet.

Btw. I do see the content of URL link, it's just not formatted. Reporter wrote
that he's window is "empty".

What are the build times for the succeeding and failing builds?
2005-02-20 build is from 7:13am
2005-02-21 build is from 7:33am
Checkin range (+3 hours on each side):

bryner's changes for bindings are not in this range.

Brief tests show that chrome://communicator/content/xml/XMLPrettyPrint.xml loads
fine in Firefox, but chrome://communicator/content/xml/XMLPrettyPrint.xsl gives
an XML parse error at:

  &xml.nostylesheet;

(no way to tell what the error is, because XML error messages are busted too,
apparently; is there a bug on this?).

Another brief test shows that chrome://communicator/locale/xml/prettyprint.dtd
doesn't load anything in Firefox (it loads the right thing in SeaMonkey).

Based on that, over to Gandalf.
Ah, the XML error message thing is bug 283766.
So here's the question.  What does
chrome://communicator/locale/xml/prettyprint.dtd actually resolve to ?  The
jar.mn entry for prettyprint.dtd is:

en-US.jar:
  locale/en-US/communicator/xml/prettyprint.dtd  (locale/en-US/prettyprint.dtd)

and checking a firefox install that shows this problem, en-US.jar does contain
the file at locale/en-US/communicator/xml/prettyprint.dtd in the jar.  So is the
problem that the chrome URI is not resolving to the right thing, perhaps?

What's happening is quite simple, though I don't know how it got to this point:
there is no longer a contents.rdf file for communicator/locale. Since we are
trying to (re)remove the communicator package from firefox. The only four files
remaining in this package are

security/caps.properties
layout/xmlparser.properties
xml/prettyprint.dtd
webservices/security.properties

Gandalf, please add back the communicator contents.rdf file until you get these
moved to their final home.
The page was empty because the xml i loaded did not contain any text-data
between tags, only attributes was present.

this one is fixed with my lastest checkin in bug 279768
