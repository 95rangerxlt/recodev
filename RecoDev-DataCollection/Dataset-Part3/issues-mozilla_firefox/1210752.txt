Tested on Windows 10, I haven't tested on other platforms.
The new icons look really nice, but they have blurry edges.
Hmm, looks like the previous ones were sort of blurry too, but I guess I'm seeing this now because the old ones had a bit more straight lines (especially the inspector which now has rounded corners).
Is there anything we can do?
They look so sharp on a mac retina screen that it feels really odd when I switch over to windows on a normal density screen.

That is so weirdâ€”I'll dig around and see what I can learn about SVGs appearing blurry and how to fix it...
Stephen, it looks like you've worked with some other resolution bugs in the past -->> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878288

Any chance you've run into what we're experiencing here?

Test SVG with some different Illustrator flags set; it's possible that the editor exports with an anti-aliasing flag that's creating the fuzziness (or it's possible that we need to pass a crisp-edges flag or something like that as outlined here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering)

I haven't cleaned up this file at all, sorry!
So, spent a bit of time with bgrins on this trying a few things:

- Seems like shape-rendering has little-to-no effect. We went messed with some of the flags outlined here but none seemed to do much to improve the fuzziness below 20px: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering

- Tried messing with some anti-aliasing flags in Illustrator before exporting. This didn't do anything. Bleh.

I read through some stack exchange issues and found this, which seems to suggest it's more of an issue with curved lines in SVGs at small sizes: http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/42438/svg-images-showing-up-blurry-in-safari-in-any-size-smaller-than-20-px (also relevant: http://opticalcortex.com/svg-rendering-in-browsers/)

So, unless shorlander knows of some tricks, the answer to solving the fuzz might be to modify the icons themselves.

Pixel Grid Alignment

The icons don't appear to be pixel snapped, that is causing the blurriness.

Clearing flag, looks like Comment 6 will do the trick

Much better with the patch applied, thanks!
The performance tool's icon is probably the one that remains the most blurry one, but I don't this comes from a lack of pixel-snapping, rather from the fact that it doesn't have any straight lines and is quite complex.

Agreed, might be worth revisiting eventually.
We'll need to request uplift for this for 44 since the merge happened early
Marking checkin-needed - icon swap, shouldn't need a try push

It's still early in the Aurora cycle and this change looks safe enough. Approved for uplift to Aurora44.
