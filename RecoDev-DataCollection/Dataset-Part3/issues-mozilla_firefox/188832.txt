Print preview in phoenix does not seem to call |InitPrintSettingsFromPrinter| /
|InitPrintSettingsFromPrefs| when switching to print preview mode, causing
various problems with Print Preview.
The problem does not exist in normal Mozilla.

Taking myself...

Patch for yesterday's Phoenix trunk - port the code from xpfe's printing.js to Phoenix's browser.js

1:1 port from Mozilla's printing.js fixes the issue... :)
