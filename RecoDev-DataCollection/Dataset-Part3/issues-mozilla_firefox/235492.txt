I was trying to move the "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" to live on the same line as
some of my other buttons, so I opened "Customize..." and dragged the item out of
the bookmarks toolbar into the new space. Then I hid the Bookmarks Toolbar from
the View menu. The bookmarks disappeared. When the Bookmarks Toolbar was
reenabled from the View menu, it was empty and the bookmarks were still gone. If
I go to "Customize..." I can see the "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" icon again, but
whenever I leave "Customize..." there's nothing there.

The worst part is that when I try and put the item back into the empty bookmarks
toolbar, they still won't display. Seems they're gone for good.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Show the bookmarks toolbar.
2. Use customize to move the "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" somewhere else.
3. Hide the bookmarks toolbar.

Actual Results:  
The bookmarks disappeared.

Expected Results:  
They should have stayed right where I put them.

I just tried again with Firefox 0.9.

1. Opened Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Used customize to move "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" arouns
3. Closed Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Moved "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" into "Customize" pane
4. Opened Bookmarks Toolbar
5. Moved "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" back into Bookmarks Toolbar space.

And now there are no more bookmarks. Whenever I go into customize "Bookmarks
Toolbar Items" is there, but nothing displays normally. After those steps,
moving the "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" anywhere else dosen't bring them back either.
It works for me as well in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.7) Gecko/20040709 Firefox/0.9.0+

Reporter some work was done in this area (customize + bookmark toolbar) during
the last week, could you please try again with a build from here:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-0.9/
I just tried with the latest from
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-0.9.1/

And using the exact steps I outlined in my comment above, was able to reproduce
the problem.
Err, you wanted latest-0.9 not latest-0.9.1 (of course it still might not work
but please try it with the right one so we can be sure).
OK, I checked with the 0.9 nightly, and it works. Thanks.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
