looks we lose to sqlite on Windows when we shutdown during "make check". The fix is to try to clean up before and after running the tests.

delete the database before and after the tests
*** Bug 357556 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
from irc:

dietrich: what do you mean by "we lose to sqlite" -- that we can't delete the file b/c sqlite has it locked?
sayrer:   yeah
hmm, more data. This definitely fixes windows, but causes new symptoms on mac, where the unit tests warn of reentrant service creation. more later.
Ah, since the unit tests start with a clean profile, the bookmarks service init tries to add a livemark, but the livemark service needs the bookmarks service to do that. nasty.

407     // migrate the user's old bookmarks
408     // FIXME: move somewhere else to some profile migrator thingy
409     nsCOMPtr<nsIFile> bookmarksFile;
410     rv = NS_GetSpecialDirectory(NS_APP_BOOKMARKS_50_FILE,
411                                 getter_AddRefs(bookmarksFile));
412     if (bookmarksFile) {
413       PRBool bookmarksFileExists;
414       rv = bookmarksFile->Exists(&bookmarksFileExists);
415       if (NS_SUCCEEDED(rv) && bookmarksFileExists) {
416         nsCOMPtr<nsIIOService> ioservice = do_GetService(
417                                     "@mozilla.org/network/io-service;1", &rv);
418         NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
419         nsCOMPtr<nsIURI> bookmarksFileURI;
420         rv = ioservice->NewFileURI(bookmarksFile,
421                                    getter_AddRefs(bookmarksFileURI));
422         NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
423         rv = ImportBookmarksHTMLInternal(bookmarksFileURI, PR_FALSE, 0);
424         NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
425       }
426     }

solves the cycle

this fixes all of the bugs with the unit tests and an empty profile. 

we have a nasty habit of kicking off livemarks HTTP requests during startup, so I created a new way of doing things that creates an empty livemarks folder without starting a fetch. Now I need to find somewhere smart to load the feeds in browser/.
Rob, is this patch dependent on the delayedStartup work you are doing? Wondering, b/c there's no review request on the 2nd patch..

Yes. I should get to it soon.

OK. There a couple follow-up bugs I need to file, but we should land this now instead of waiting on those.

shouldn't the JS implementation of createLivemarkFolderOnly() return an id, like we do for createLivemark()?

(specifically, are you missing a "return livemarkID;")

heh, yeah. The caller doesn't use it, so I didn't notice. I bet I could add a unit test for this ;)

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
