I just confirmed that I can repro on a fresh profile. Here's an STR:
1. Open Minefield
2. Open 3 windows
3. Open a link from an external app
4. Change windows and try opening a link again

You might need to repeat 3 & 4 a couple times to do it.


I've experienced this with links from Tbird, Mail.app, and Terminal.app

Ben: I tried to reproduce with today's build, : Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9b4pre) Gecko/2008022704 Minefield/3.0b4pre.  Here is what I see when I follow your STR with a fresh profile.

STR:
1. Use default tab setting, New Pages should be opened in a new tab. My understanding is this pref covers both internal links and links launched from external apps.
2. Open three Minefield windows. Set focus on one window.
3. Launch a link from Tbird (I tried both Tbird trunk and Tbird branch)
4. Watch where the link opens

In each case the link I clicked from Tbird opened in the last window I had focus in.
Marcia, can you try clicking a link in Colloquy or Mail.app or another app?

Also, Ben, what addons do you have? I'm using Adblock Plus, JavaScript Debugger 0.9.87.2, Linky, Personas. I'll test safe-mode or a new profile in a bit and report back.

/be
I installed Linky, JS Debugger and personas. Using the same profile and build as in Comment 1 and launching links from mail.app and tbird, I get the same results as in Comment 1.
I've got:
Adblock Filterset.G Updater 0.3.1.3
Adblock Plus 0.7.5.3
Canadian English Dictionary 1.1.0
Flashblock 1.5.5
Greasemonkey 0.7.20080121.0
Nightly Tester Tools 1.3
Stop-or-Reload Button 0.2.2
Web Developer 1.1.4

I've tested with a fresh profile and can reproduce this bug with it.

What are the expected and actual results?
The link should open in the last used window (ie. the one on top).
I can't reproduce this anymore.
