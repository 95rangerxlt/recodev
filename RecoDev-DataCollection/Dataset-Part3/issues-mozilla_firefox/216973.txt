Confirming new.
Broken in Firebird 20030817 PC/WinXP.
Works in Mozilla 1.4 and nightly 20030821 PC/WinXP
Confirming the problem in Linux using Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;
rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030817 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1+ so I OS should be set to All.

Moreover, reloading the page makes it look different (the columns have different
width each time I reload the page).
I have looked at the Trolltech web page with this week's Firebird builds
(Gecko/20030830 and later), both on Windows and Linux, and now the page is
rendered correctly. So, looks like the problem has been solved! Great job!!!!
