Now that we've fixed more bugs it is time to re-prompt nightly users to try e10s again. We should probably include some new wording in the prompt to talk about some of the things we've fixed since the last time (crashers, pdfjs, ... ideas?) so users who disabled it before might be more tempted to try again.

I still see the existing prompt every time I ./mach run (creating a new profile by default). Can we fix that when changing this new prompt? It's really annoying.
I hope we fix bug 1072980 first, I tried enabling E10s and my browser entered a perma-crash situation, forcing me to manually edit prefs.js to disable E10s.

ah looks like it's due to forceRTL add-on, so, likely not a real blocker.

Fwiw, you can use Safe mode which disables e10s and then you can edit the pref or uncheck the checkbox in the preferences dialog.

yeah, but I was a little bit upset and forgot about the shift+launch option :)
Hi Felipe, can you provide a point value.

Listing enhancements

What do people think of the simple approach of showing the list of enhancements in the popup?

Chris, what should we fill this list with?

feedbacking Madhava but anyone who cares to chime in, please do
I think it's a good idea because it will give people who opted-out a reason to try e10s again.

Re-prompt patch

This improves on the previous code as the following:

- easier to bump number for other rounds of re-prompting, and it will clean up after the previous pref
- won't display for local builds as requested in comment 1 (I couldn't use OFFICIAL_BRANDING check because that's also false for Nightly, so I used the update channel)
- added check for hardware acceleration so it's not gonna be offered for users who would be blocked from running e10s

The message param for doorhangers doesn't accept multi-line text, so we need to use the popupnotificationcontent feature to add more elements. I can't create that element dinamically because when the popup is dismissed, it would be destroyed, and not show up again when retrieved from the URLbar icon. So I had to add it to popup-notifications.inc.

Note that with this patch I'm also activating the notice added in bug 1063842. It will show up once for every user running with e10s autostart.

This looks OK to me, but can I see a screenshot of the popup?

As these will probably stack up, should this be an array of old prompt prefs?

I was planning on just clearing the immediate previous pref, not all the past ones. We don't even need to do it, but it's just a bit nicer to not leave these prefs poluting the profile.

Ah, yes - somehow missed the screenshot there. My bad.

Right, and I'm all for un-polluting user profiles where we can. The scenario I'm thinking of is that a user enables e10s, and then decides to change to a different channel (or doesn't use their Nightly) for some time so that we skip clearing one or more prefs. It's not a big deal, but it'd be nice to maybe clean-up where we can.

Otherwise, I thinks this looks good as a E10S_TESTING_ONLY sorta thing.

Listing enhancements

I'm OK with this, but let's
- keep A, B, and C short (one line each)
- and no more than three -- possibly fewer?

And this _isn't_ a precedent for starting to do this in release.
Felipe: here is a list of bugs fixed since we first prompted Nightly users to test e10s on November 12:

http://is.gd/FBsTJW

Three notable fixes:

* Improved add-on compatibility
* Fixed many Developer Tools bugs
* Fixed spell checker

I don't think we should include bug numbers because these are meta-issues that include many fixes.

Yeah, good point.. I'll postpone doing this the next time when there's a second pref to clean-up :)
I combined everyone's suggestions and landed the final text as:

Would you like to help us test multiprocess Nightly (e10s)? You can also enable e10s in Nightly preferences. Notable fixes:

  Less crashing!
  Improved add-on compatibility and DevTools
  PDF.js, Web Console, Spellchecking, WebRTC now work
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/cde9ebf247be
This merged to m-c, and then I backed this out in https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f5557f04db0b at Felipe's request so it doesn't ship in a Nightly on Friday or over the weekend.
Relanded for showing up on Monday's Nightly: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/facebebfea4d
