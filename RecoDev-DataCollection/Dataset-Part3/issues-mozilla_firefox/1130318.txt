It should be possible to get also the raw header source for HTTP requests/responses from the backend.

The source can be sent as a response to the existing "getRequestHeader" packet sent to "netEvent" actor.

E.g:

{
  from: "actor-id",
  headers: [],
  headersSize: 0,
  source: String  // <--- NEW
}

(note that 'source' field isn't currently part of the HAR spec)

Or it could be sent as part of new request type.

Thoughts?

@Victor: what do you think (should I CC someone else yet?)

Honza
Yes, it would definitely be useful, and it's a real blocker for some bugs ("show actual raw http headers" etc.). Currently, we reconstruct everything on the frontend side, but that's not such a great thing to do.

Very nice. Needs a test and making the headers source a long string actor.

I like this. Maybe rename headersSource to rawHeaders, and it should be a long string actor, not a plain string, to avoid sending too much data over the protocol.

Ditto.

I don't think we should send this here. The other two requests are enough.

Fixed now. The source is sent on demand (getRequestHeaders/getResponseHeaders) and it's a LongStringActor.

Is there an existing test I could start from?

Both tests extended to cover also rawHeaders field.
