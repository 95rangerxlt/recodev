1. Open http://example.org/ in a new tab
2. Type "example.com" (without quotes) into urlbar instead of "example.org", press Enter
3. Click "Back" button to get back to example.org
4. Hover mouse over the "forward" button
5. Press left mouse button [don't release it] and quickly ( less than 2 seconds ) move mouse to the right/left/up - away from the button.

Result:       Forward button has no borders. It's a long-standing issue
Expectations: Anything better than that

When I repeat these steps, at step 6 of releasing the mouse button, the borders come back. This would be nice to fix but since it fixes itself on mouseup I'm less inclined to put a higher priority on it.
