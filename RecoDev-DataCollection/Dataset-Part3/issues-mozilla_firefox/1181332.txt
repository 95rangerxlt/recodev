Loading view-source:https://self-repair.mozilla.org/en-US/repair/index.js shows the following comment twice:

/**!
	  About this module:
	
	  Runner
	  repair list // Should move?
	  Main loop
	
	  This is is the output target for webpack
	*/

It looks like the actual JS is not duplicated. We should remove these comments from the production output though.

Explanation:  Babel by default leaves comments alone.  Agree, will fix.
