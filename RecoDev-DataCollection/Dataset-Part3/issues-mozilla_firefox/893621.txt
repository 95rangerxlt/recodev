WFM on Mac with the latest Nightly. Can someone confirm it works/doesn't work on Linux.

Erik, do you have any extensions installed that change the browser UA?
Can you confirm whether this is still happening and if it may be caused by extensions? So far we haven't had other reports of this and haven't been able to reproduce.

Yes, I noticed the bug while testing Scriptish.  Let's keep this bug open for now, I will be testing Scriptish again soon, and I'll try to determine the root of the issue.
Erik: this seems to be duplicate of bug 711487 - please check.
We've switched to CodeMirror which may have fixed this as a side effect.
This should be tested again now that we're using CodeMirror.
Seems to work.
