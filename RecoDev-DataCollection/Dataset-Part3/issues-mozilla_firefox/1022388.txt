Confirmed, black screen over the content, 32.0a1 (2014-06-09) Win 7 x64
Thanks for the report. Is this with Shumway set up and other Flash content working, or just with a clean profile? Testing on Windows 8 with a clean profile, both FF30 and today's Nightly work as expected.

Facing the issue on both.
Yury, can you look into this? It apparently blocks mwobensmith's work.
I see this on latest Fx33 as well. 

I'm using a build of Fx32 from 2014-05-28 that seems to be OK, so it might be worthwhile to look for a regression range.
Last good nightly: 2014-06-06
First bad nightly: 2014-06-07

Pushlog:
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=c8288d0c7a15&tochange=62d33e3ba514
I tried to bisect archived mozilla-inbound builds between 2014-06-06 and 2014-06-07 using mozregression. I saw the "black screen" problem Paul reported in comment 1, but not the "no shumway button" problem.

When the Shumway instance is black, the following error logged to stderr:

> ShumwayStreamConverter.js: Timeout during shumway instance initialization

I'm using Shumway version 0.8.377. I bisected the blank Shumway instance problem to this regression range (that overlaps, but is not a subset of Yury's pushlog in comment 7). I'm testing OS X, if that makes a difference.
