Every time I go to the above URL the entire window visiting that URL freezes.  Other windows are unaffected but other tabs on the same URL are unaccesable.  If you click on other tabs their titles appear on the browser window and the bookmark toolbar still works but the page itself will not render, i.e., the part where you see the web pages is completely frozen and will not render anything.  

The page URL (in the primary toolbar on top) is also frozen and cannot be selected or otherwise allow text entry.  The search box also does not allow any entry but the menu allowing one to select other search engines still displays.  Trying to go to another webpage via bookmarks changes the page title again but leaves the page itself frozen, i.e., it is still blank and white.

In Camino, the page can be displayed.
But it is very heavy.

trunk build Camino 2005110721 (v1.0+)
Are there reports of issues with large text pages? Or can we create a test case that shows it doesn't have troubles rendering very large pages of text.  Cause otherwise all that is on that page is JS/CSS.

I would also like to see some Windows/Linux trunk builds to see how that act.
This bug still exists on Firefox 1.5.0.1 on OS X 10.4.6

I did some work on the page trying to cut out the parts not essential to the error and found some weird results.  If I remove either the CSS or try to cut down the length of the huge comments in any long section or remove the photo near the end the page will render.  If I remove the comment on my attachment with an invalid character reference according to w3c validator I get a partial render where it fills the top quarter of page and will scroll in that area (clearly screwed up) but the rest of the browser won't freeze.

Also the linke to this js (http://s16.sitemeter.com/js/counter.js?site=s16schneier ) is necessery for the error as well as this snippet from the standard MT js:

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

<!--

if (document.comments_form.email != undefined)

    document.comments_form.email.value = getCookie("mtcmtmail");

if (document.comments_form.author != undefined)

    document.comments_form.author.value = getCookie("mtcmtauth");

if (document.comments_form.url != undefined)

    document.comments_form.url.value = getCookie("mtcmthome");

if (getCookie("mtcmtauth") || getCookie("mtcmthome")) {

    document.comments_form.bakecookie[0].checked = true;

} else {

    document.comments_form.bakecookie[1].checked = true;

}

//-->

</script>


Perhaps when I have more time I can try to cut down the file I attached down further but still have it freeze the browser.  However, this bug seems resistant to any simple characterization.

Given the needed js I posted above which asks the dom if a form exists below the *huge* list of comments I suspect the error has something to do with timing, i.e., loading time of the page interacting with the JS questions about the page.

This issue seems to be fixed in firefox 3.0b1.  Since no one has taken this bug and I'm the initial submiter I'm going to see if I can mark it fixed.  Let me know if this is rude.
