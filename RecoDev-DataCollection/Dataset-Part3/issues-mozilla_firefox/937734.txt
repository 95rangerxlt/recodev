Love to. There's some proportion issues with OS X that I mentioned back in bug 873626 comment 21. Is bug 893661 is where we're tracking that?
Yeah, the proportion issue is tracked in bug 893661, but if the proportion issue needs to be fixed before this one then maybe you could take that bug as well?

I made a comment on bug 893661. :)
Just to keep updates. Fixing bug 873626 also fixes this one inadvertently.
Thanks, closing now.
Actually, those patches in bug 873626 were only for Linux and Windows themes. Are you saying that the same approach as those patches can be taken for OSX?

Whoops. I'm sorry for the confusion. I copied and pasted the wrong bug number. The WIP of Bug 893661 fixes it as the back button stretches the nav-bar 2px.
This should be fixed per bug 893661.
