screenshots.GIF upper is Firefox-32.03, lower is Acrobat

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

I created a PDF using ReportLab with an embedded CMYK Jpeg.


Actual results:

When viewed in firefox preview the colours were wrong. See screenshots upper part. I suspect Firefox is ignoring a /Decode [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0] command in the PDF.


Expected results:

The acrobat reader shows the correct colours see screenshots lower part

bad2.pdf the PDF that I used as a test

This PDF contains the following startup for the image 5 0 obj
<< /BitsPerComponent 8 /ColorSpace /DeviceCMYK /Decode [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] /Filter [ /ASCII85Decode /DCTDecode ] /Height 100 /Length 15796 
  /Subtype /Image /Type /XObject /Width 100 >>

If the /Decode [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] is replaced with blanks ie don't reverse the colour values then Acrobat also shows the wrong colours.
This looks fine on FF33 for me. Could you confirm with an updated version?

Fixed by Bug 1025878 - Update pdf.js to version 1.0.370. r=yury
I confirm I don't see this reversal on FF33 Beta and that the PDF preview does obey the /Decode array properly. Thanks for the fix.
