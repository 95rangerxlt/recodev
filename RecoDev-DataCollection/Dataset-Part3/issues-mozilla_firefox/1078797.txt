Check running state before reinstalling app

There's currently a race after reinstalling an app because the "appInstall" event signals completion of install, but then we make a request to "listRunningApps" in parallel to check if the new app is running.

I'm working around this by remembering whether the app was already running instead.

Is there a race between two request over RDP and responses end up being mixed?
app.running should still be true, even during the install request,
unless we receive appClose event in the meantime.

The race was created by |_clientListener|.  It deletes the app on re-install, and re-lists running apps, but never waits for an answer.

It's always better to just fix a race of course, so now I'm doing that in this new version.
