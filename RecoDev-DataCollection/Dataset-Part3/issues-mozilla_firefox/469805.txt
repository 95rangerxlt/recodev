Sounds like this might be bug 437174. Not sure.

(oh, and BugZilla went a little linkify-happy on you ;)
Once bug 437174 is fixed, this is going to need to be fixed in the Firefox UI (using the APIs that bug will add).
Dan, do you know what needs to be changed in the front end in order to properly support this now that bug 437174 is fixed?
It looks like the necessary changes were already made to contentAreaUtils.js and nsWebBrowserPersist.cpp, before 3.6 branched: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=437174#c95

Tested 3.5 and it's broken, tested trunk and it works. So we should be good here.
I up to date to Firefox/3.5.2 in my system windows XP, after this my site don't read right the cookies. The last version was very well. I don't understand very well if the problem up writted is the same, but I writte about this now.
Thanks.
