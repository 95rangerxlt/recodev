Relatively positioned menu does not load when page with target location is embedded inside a frame. The following error is reported in the javascript console:

Go to www.rangichangi.com to reproduce. Correct display of menu can be seen in http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/prod/dialspace/town/pipexdsl/s/asst40/nepalweb.
