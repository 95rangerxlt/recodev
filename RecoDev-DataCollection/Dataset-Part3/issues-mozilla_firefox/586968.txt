Bug 574217 made the tab toolbar's default set be "tabbrowser-tabs,new-tab-button,tabview-button,alltabs-button,tabs-closebutton". alltabs-button is restricted to visible tabs only, whereas tabview-button offers the broader view. Their order on the toolbar should be reversed.

Good point, we should put the Tab Candy button on the other side. Though I'm not sure why we need the drop-down list of tabs anymore.

Hmm, can't remember if you need to do extra fu to change the order on an existing profile. Probably not worth the effort here, anyway?
