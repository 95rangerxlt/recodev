The Date.now() call isn't necessary, because we make all the spacers/separators ourselves, and so the counter is always up to date.

I am ready to work on this bug. Should the Date.now() call be removed from the line along with the comments ?

On second thought, unfortunately after a restart the counter would have been reset. So we'd need to store the counter to ensure that elements created after a restart don't conflict with the ones created the previous session. This could be done inside the current preference storage in the same JSON object, see:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm?rev=aa03fbc1149f#1429

and

http://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm?rev=aa03fbc1149f#1341

But yes, the Date.now() call should be removed, and the comment above it adjusted to reflect what the code is doing.

This would be my first bug can you guide me to setup the workflow so that its easier to look into the  code and work on it.
Soumya, hi and thank you for helping!

If you need guidance or advice with getting set up for your first bug, you're welcome to ask in the #introduction channel on IRC (server irc.mozilla.org):

irc://irc.mozilla.org/introduction

Someone there should be able to assist you and answer any questions you have. :)
Soumya and I had the following conversation on #introduction earlier today:

[2013-10-16 10:54:09] <Gijs> soumyaC: so, you've got a copy of https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/, and you've built Firefox? :)
[2013-10-16 10:55:27] <soumyaC> Gijs: yup done !
[2013-10-16 10:55:41] <Gijs> soumyaC: so if you look at the file browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm
[2013-10-16 10:56:31] <Gijs> soumyaC: near the top there's the definition of gNewElementCount. And then we use that in the ensureSpecialWidgetId
[2013-10-16 10:56:34] <Gijs> function
[2013-10-16 10:56:59] <Gijs> soumyaC: so in that function, you can get rid of the Date.now() call, and adjust the comment
[2013-10-16 10:57:32] <Gijs> soumyaC: then in the saveState function, there's a variable "state" being defined
[2013-10-16 10:57:55] <Gijs> it has properties "placements", "seen" and "dirtyAreaCache"
[2013-10-16 10:58:24] <Gijs> soumyaC: you should add another property to the object: "newElementCount" and assign it the value of gNewElementCount
[2013-10-16 10:58:51] <Gijs> soumyaC: then in the loadSavedState function, you should read out the value of that property (ie, newElementCount) and store it into gNewElementCount.
[2013-10-16 10:58:53] <Gijs> soumyaC: make sense?
[2013-10-16 10:59:29] <soumyaC> I will just correlate with the code and buzz you back
[2013-10-16 11:03:19] <soumyaC> Gijs: yup makes sense !
[2013-10-16 11:03:37] <Gijs> soumyaC: great! :)
[2013-10-16 11:04:30] <soumyaC> Gijs: In loadSavedState we should read the newElementCount and assign it to gNewElementCount right ?
[2013-10-16 11:14:52] <Gijs> soumyaC: yes

Soumya, let us know if you have any followup questions!

Thanks. Have already done the above, now making changes in the code :) Will update the ticket soon.
Are you sure that trading off Date.now against a counter and extra data to store is a net simplification?

It's not even just that, using Date.now is wrong. Computer clocks change. It's a bad uniqueness guarantee.

Erm, no, gNewElementCount is a number, not a Set ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set ). It should be:

gNewElementCount = gSavedState.newElementCount || 0;
oops, my bad, sorry to overlook that. Will attach a new one.

This looks good to me. Have you checked that all the tests still pass? From the top of your source directory, after running:

./mach build browser/components

Run:

./mach mochitest-browser browser/components/customizableui/test/

And check that the final output says that all the tests passed. If that has happened, please set the "checkin-needed" keyword in the keywords field of this bug (or comment if Bugzilla doesn't let you, and I'll do it for you).

Thanks a lot for the patch!

Awesome!

Landed on the UX branch as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/4146c94be0e0

This'll become part of mozilla-central when we merge the Australis work (hopefully soon, but no firm date yet).

Thank you for helping us build Australis!
