A window was opened from a webpage using javascript without the feature 'toolbar' set to yes.  i.e. window.open('http://www.google.ca','_blank','menubar=yes');
When I then went to Print Preview (File->Print Preview), the print preview toolbar was missing.

NTOE: Opening a window with 'toolbar=yes' does not have this problem. i.e. window.open('http://www.google.ca','_blank','menubar=yes,toolbar=yes');

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new browser window through javascript using window.open('http://www.google.ca','_blank','menubar=yes');
2. Click File->Print Preview
Actual Results:  
The print preview screen appears but there is no toolbar

Expected Results:  
The print preview screen should have shown the toolbar with the buttons such as "Print...", "Page Setup...", etc.

HTML Testcase:
<a onclick="window.open('http://www.google.ca','_blank','menubar=yes');">Open Popup</a>

I just wanted to update this bug to say that it is still present in Firefox 3 RC1 (2008051206)
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090707 Minefield/3.6a1pre

I can definitely reproduce this bug using the STR in comment 0.  I think this is most likely due to the fact that the window that print preview is loaded from has no toolbar.  Since print preview is launched in the window without a toolbar, it has no toolbar as well.

Mac is not an issue because it uses the Preview app.

v.1 add toolbar-primary class to p.p. toolbar

I'm not sure if this is the correct class to add to the toolbar as I couldn't find documentation on it but this seems to do the trick.

v.1 add toolbar-primary class to p.p. toolbar

Just use .className? Suppose you could change the other to .id too.

v.2 - use .className and .id

use .className and .id instead of setAttribute
