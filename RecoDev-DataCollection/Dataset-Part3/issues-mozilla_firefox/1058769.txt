Like it says on the tin; verify that community members can build Firefox with the free-to-use Express version of MSVS2013.

Self-assigning this, taking notes along the way.

First thing of note is that "Visual Studio Express for Windows" is distinct from "Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop". The former is Win8+ only, and won't install on Win7.

We'll need to specify that in the documentation when the time comes.
What about Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition (comes with Update 4 included)?
FWIW, I've recently (last week, in fact) built successfully with https://chocolatey.org/packages/VisualStudioExpress2013WindowsDesktop
Sounds like this is good then.
