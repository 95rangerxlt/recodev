Localization Release Tasks for Application Update

All of the builds that you sign off on will be staged out to all of our mirrors.
 This mirroring out process can take as much as 24 hours (time for all of our
mirrors to get the builds).  Keep an eye on this bug to see if your locale is
staged and ready for testing.

In order to make each of the localizations available via Application
Update, we need your help to test the update mechanism. For those builds
that are already available on all of our mirrors, this should be able to
be completed quickly. For those builds that haven't all mirrored out, it
could be up to 24 hours before this testing can be completed.

To test the update mechanism, you need to install each of Windows
Firefox 1.0, Firefox 1.0.1, Firefox 1.0.3, and Firefox 1.0.3 and follow 
these steps for each of those builds:

1. Type about:config in the address bar and hit enter.
2. Locate and change the app.update.url string to the .rdf URL listed
   below.
3. Restart and go to Tools -> Options and select the Advanced panel.
4. Locate and press the Check Now for updates button.

At this point, you should be notified that the 1.0.4 update is
available.

5. Proceed to download and install.
6. At the end of the install, start Firefox and select the Help -> About
   Mozilla Firefox menu item to verify that you are running version
   1.0.4.

If all of this is successful, please add a comment to this bug informing us
of that and we will update the live RDF file which will notify all users
of your locale that an update is available.

If the update fails and you are testing one of the builds below marked
with a *, please repeat the test and if it still fails, please report
that failure to this thread. Be sure to included the steps you took
above and where in those steps the install failed as well as how it
failed. Likely failures will be a "hang" between step 4 and step 5. If
your update is successful, please add a comment to this bug informing us of
that and we will update the live RDF file which will notify all users of
your locale that an update is available.

If the update fails and you are testing one of the builds marked with a
?, please wait and try again in several hours. If it is still failing in
24 hours, please report that failure to this bug. Your builds may not
have made it to all the mirrors yet and that could cause the failure
(between step 4 and step 5.) so do not report a failure until the build
will have had a chance to mirror out to all of the servers.

Here are the quick checklist for this set of tests:

   o The about:config preference name is 'app.update.url'.
   o The URL to chance it to is in the format of
     https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/test/<L10n>.rdf
     and each one of these is listed below
   o Only test Windows platforms.  Other platforms will show no
     updates.
   o Use as an example en-US update as a baseline to set expectations
     for how the update should function. Your update should work just
     like en-US.
   o Verify each of these update paths.
         o 1.0 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.1 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.2 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4


Additionally, once you have verified the test .rdf URLs are working and we make
your locale live, you will need to retest using the default .rdf URL:

https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/<l10n>.rdf

for these upgrade paths: 
         o 1.0 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.1 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.2 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4

to verify that the live .rdf files are working as well.  If you have any
questions, please post them in this bug.  Thanks.

     Install **FAILED** with error -207  --  2005-05-12 08:18:12

Can the BOM at the beginning of hu-HU.rdf be the problem here?
pl-PL - each update works OK (phase 1 - test; tested on Win98 SE).

1.0   -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.1 -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.2 -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.3 -> 1.0.4 - OK

The only problem is the one mentioned in bug 290883 comment 11 - the red update
icon stays on when the updated (1.0.4) Firefox is launched. Clicking it shows no
available updates and the icon disappears. 

However, the same problem occurs with the en-US version of the update.
Firefox 1.0.3 es-ES reports that there's an update with the test url, but fails
to download (this is supposed to be the expected behaviour). But with the real
url, it just can't find any updates.
Update test results for tr-TR (Turkish):

1.0 -> 1.0.4: Succesfully updated. See the note below.
1.0.1 -> 1.0.4: Succesfully updated. See the note below.
1.0.2 -> 1.0.4: Succesfully updated. See the note below.
1.0.3 -> 1.0.4: Succesfully updated. See the note below.

Note: At first lunch of updated Firefox, there was red update notification icon
at right-top of Firefox window. Clicked and checked for updates again. It didn't
find anything new, because it had already been updated to 1.0.4. The icon
disappered by the next (2nd) launch.
it-IT, pl-PL, tr-TR updates made live.

I'm not sure what you're describing here.  The hu-HU RDF looks similar to all
the other 1.0.4 update RDF files.  Also, I'm not sure what the -207 error is.

We occasionally run into problems with update when files haven't mirrored out to
enough sites.  Since the update has had more time to stage out, could you try it
again?
For ca-AD, each update works fine. Tested in Windows XP.

1.0   -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.1 -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.2 -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.3 -> 1.0.4 - OK

I referred to the Byte Order Mark, the three bytes at the beginning of the file:
&#271;Â»&#380;<?xml version="1.0"?>
The other languages I checked did not have it. However, the problem was
different, as the BOM is still there, but the update works now.

I confirm, that https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/test/hu-HU.rdf works for
these upgrade paths: 
         o 1.0 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.1 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.2 -> 1.0.4
         o 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4




The en-GB RDF <https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/en-GB.rdf>
doesn't have a 1.0.4 entry :(
For cs-CZ, each update works fine. Tested in Windows 2000.

1.0   -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.1 -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.2 -> 1.0.4 - OK
1.0.3 -> 1.0.4 - OK
de-DE.rdf is missing the 1.0.3 entry, so we don't get an update for 1.0.4, who
can help here?
sl-SI update works OK
fi-FI all update paths working OK.
For ru-RU, each update works fine. Tested in Windows 2000 SP4.
the first eu-ES official release is 1.0.3

1.0.3 -> 1.0.4 - updated successfully (win98 SE)
es-AR updates work OK.
All updates tested on Windows XP.

Tested on Win98 SE.
pt-PT -> everything ok.
pt-BR works fine.
THIS IS URGENT!!!
Germany is the biggest market for Mozilla outside the US and still it's RDF file
hasn't been updated for almost a week. This is not a feature update but the most
serious security vulnerability since 1.0. I tried to reach people here and on
IRC but nobody seems to be responsible. I'm very patient, but enough is enough.
As you can imagine, this is especially at this time very bad for our reputation
here in the german speaking countries.

You are to test https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/test/en-GB.rdf first, not
the live update URL.

Sorry about not testing earlier; as a localizer, I was not aware of this bug's
existence.
Round up of locales not offering Firefox 1.0.4 using the update mechanism. See
the first post for information on the steps needed.
