This behavior occurs if the item is a link or a bookmarks folder with no sub-folders. Bookmarks folders with sub-folders get highlighted by typing.

Keyboard navigation of menus sets the [_moz-menuactive] attribute.
Using this selector for both toolbarbuttons and menuitems is kind of a mess...

It would be great to clean up the toolbarbutton/menuitem mess that we have with the menu panel and subviews, but I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.

This needs to be backed out, because `_moz_menuactive == "true"` on mouse hover. This causes the menu items on mouse hover to receive the ACTIVE button styling, which is darker than the HOVER styles.

In other words, this is not the right fix.

Good catch, thanks.  This patch (when applied on top of the first one) applies "hover" styling instead of "active" styling for [_moz-menuactive="true"] menuitems.

Stealing this review. This won't apply cleanly anymore now that it's been backed out, but the gist of this is sound. I trust your rebasing skills. r=me.
