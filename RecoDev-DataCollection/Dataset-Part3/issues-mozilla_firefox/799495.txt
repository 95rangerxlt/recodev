Morpheus3k, can you reproduce this issue with a clean profile?

yes, I can reproduce this with the given steps on Windows 7 and OS X 10.8 with recent Nightly 2012-10-15.
I managed to reproduce this issue a couple of times too eventually. It didn't reproduce with every try, so I suppose it's intermittent.
