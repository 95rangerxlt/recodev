I can confirm when creating a new profile with hardware acceleration in D3D10+D2D/DW it occurs in this range:

The problem is we're computing bad glass margins. When the bug is showing, the margins are like 800 pixels on the right and bottom.
I think the problem is probably that the display list visible region for the entire browser window gets too complex and nsDisplayListBuilder::SubtractFromVisibleRegion ends up declining to subtract the Web content area.

this bug fix is landed on build after 0104 Nightly.
see changeset number.

fixed on Hourly build after 0104 Nightly.
also on 0105 Nightly.
oh, I am sorry then. Testing 0105 nightly and the bugs seems to be partially gone.
That line hasn't actually disappeared for me, it just moved a bit lower, so it's behind the content area now. Like it always was before.
Can't that be cut completely? It's like 120-150px lower than the top border of content area.
Unfortunately, the troll is right. This bug still exists, in two ways. 

(a) Instead of the Aero glaze effect moving up behind the tab bar, it moves up only a few pixels from its usual position.

STR:
1. Clean profile (relnotes + about:home will open)
2. Enable Add-on bar
3. Close about:home tab (so only one tab is open)
 * The glass effect moves down a fraction
4. open new tab
 * The glass effect moves up a fraction

(b) Or, if you have Firebug installed, open Firebug and witness the bug as it was originally described:

STR:
1. Have two or three tabs open
2. Open Firebug (docked)
3. Resize Firebug (make it a bit bigger - about 50% of content area)
 * Glass effect goes into tab bar
Let's get a new bug filed then please.
Let's indeed.
