[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): bug 746156
User impact if declined: There is no user impact, but various build steps will fail when Firefox is built in certain configurations, including the one described in this bug and the one described in bug 773706.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): This landed on mozilla-central a while ago and has not caused any problems there.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): It's a simple, obvious fix and thus seems very low-risk.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None.
