This used to work in build 20040709
I am not noticing this on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7)
Gecko/20040710 Firefox/0.9.0+, but what I am noticing is that you cannot
customize now while in full screen, and when you go back, the buttons aren't
small and have text on them, which both were disabled when I went to full screen.

Cusomize is still available on the Menubar.

When a new instance is created, Customize is available on the Toolbar but it
disappears for the Toolbar when F11 is used twice.

When returning from the F11, Icons lose their customized settings (small) and
revert to their original size.

The find toolbar doesn't let us blissfully stuff a value in a loop into a
single global variable anymore, expecting it to be the same for each toolbar. 
The patch saves the stuff into per-toolbar temp attributes and restores them
later.

Ok, I downloaded a tinderbox build and I can verify that the bug's gone.
