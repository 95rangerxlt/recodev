There's an "Open App..." menu item in the Project menu.

In non-sidebar mode, it would trigger the project menu to appear.  In sidebar mode, it has no effect.

Let's disable the menu item in sidebar mode.

Nit: Maybe it's easier to read if the ID starts with "menuitem-"? That seems to sort of match the style of other IDs here, though there isn't really a consistent style overall.
