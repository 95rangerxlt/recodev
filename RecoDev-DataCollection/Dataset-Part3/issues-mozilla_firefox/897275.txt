This leaves the same require path for css-logic, but includes it in toolkit builds.  I'm not going to mess with the tests right now, that'll resolve itself when we merge toolkit/devtools and browser/devtools.

Non-trivial Makefile changes and additions need build config review.

This works but is not proper.

The proper way to do this is to define EXTRA_JS_MODULES in a moz.build file. See |mach mozbuild-reference| and search for EXTRA_JS_MODULES. Moving this will make this Makefile.in empty and empty Makefile.in can be deleted.

Perfect.

FYI you have a double Mercurial patch header.
