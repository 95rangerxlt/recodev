It would seem that Prefwindow V is completely broken on GTK2+XFT Linux builds at
the very least. The window is essentially unusable, looking like nothing more
than a heap of graphical glitches. It is also entirely transparent in places,
and clicking on these spots gives the focus back to the browser window, which
essentially makes them "holes".

I haven't tried a non-GTK2+XFT build yet, but I'll give it a spin as soon as
possible.

Screenshot of the problem, shamelessly stolen from a MZ forum post.

This screenshot illustrates the issue. The top icon bar works partially,
although the fonts are messed up (a chrome problem perhaps?). The content area
is mostly a big hole with graphical glitches strewn about.

I'm seeing the same here.

is browser.preferences.animateFadeIn set to true or false in about:config?
Set to false here. Setting it to true doesn't solve anything, it just causes the
window to glitch in a different way, sometimes even causing the content to blink
weirdly.
The variable doesn't appear in about:config for me so I guess it has the default
value whatever that is supposed to be.

Looks like new preference window has transparent background. Explicitly setting
background color for prefwindow element fixes this issue.

Prefwindow renders as expected on GTK1 build.

Just for the heads up, it all seems to work on GTK1 builds, so it seems this is
strictly a GTK2 issue. I'll try with a non-XFT build to see if I can narrow it
down further.
I just tried running a GTK2 build without XFT (nor FreeType2), and it doesn't
work there either. The prefwindow exhibited the same characteristics as the
GTK2+XFT one.

Preference window for my linux xft+gtk build after the patch.

Preference window for my linux xft+gtk build after the patch. Seems to work
fine, although i had to resize the window to see some things.

not the right fix.  Right fix coming in a sec.

the right fix

gnomestripe's global.css needed to have prefwindow added too.
Looks like Mike checked this in. Marking fixed. 
I've tried the latest build available (timestamp is 1st of March) and the
preferences window is still transparent and completely unusable.
If you're using a non-default theme, you will need to update your theme to a
newer version that skins the prefwindow.
Confirming that this bug has been fixed. The preferences window is now
operational with the default theme.

-> VERIFIED?
This bug is not fixed. I can still see it with Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;
en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0+

For additional information: This did not only happen on GTK2+XFT builds! I'm
using firefox-1.0+.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz. Updating the summary to reflect it.
***default theme only***.

So which build I have to use? I can't see any other linux build within
