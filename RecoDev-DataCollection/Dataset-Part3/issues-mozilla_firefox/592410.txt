When a page hasn't finished loading yet (or at least some of the requests for the page) and you hit the reload button you will sometimes see exceptions like this:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIHttpChannel.visitResponseHeaders]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/HUDService.jsm :: RL_setResponseHeader :: line 166"  data: no]

Another simple fix - no unit tests (which should be fine as that was okay for bug 592264 as well and this fix goes the same way).

>+        // Accessing the response header can throw an NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE

Explaining why in the code is more useful than referencing the bug.  Please just explain it here and lose the bug reference.
