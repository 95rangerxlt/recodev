Under Tools -> Options -> Feeds there is a radio button option, with an associated listbox.
- When screen reading the radio button option for "Subscribe to feed using:" it should say something like "Subscribe to feed using: Live bookmarks".
- Also, the listbox's label should be "Subscribe to feed using:" so that when focusing it a screen reader user knows what it's for.

This fix requires the AppendFlatStringFromSubtree fix in bug 347219.
