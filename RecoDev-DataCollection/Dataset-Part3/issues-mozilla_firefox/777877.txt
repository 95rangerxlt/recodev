When bug 753517 lands, CssRuleView.jsm can go back to using WeakMaps for edited properties.
This actually needs to depend on another bug, because we have to change what we allow.  That bug in turn depends on bug 753517.  For now, I'll call it bug 777385, though that isn't quite right.
Hmm.  I forgot about this. I'll look into how we can add support for these style things this week.
Now that bug 753517 is fixed, the map in UserProperties() should be switched back to a WeakMap.

Is this any more involved than just doing the inverse of the patch from Bug 777373? If there's more to it than that, I volunteer myself to work on it.
