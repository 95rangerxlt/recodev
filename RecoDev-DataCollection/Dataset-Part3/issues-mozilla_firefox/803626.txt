"Disable Protection" button concepts

Clicking on the mixed content indicator displays a doorhanger. Clicking on the doorhanger displays the Expanded Doorhanger, which contains more information and the ability to enable mixed content. 

We need to design an Expanded Doorhanger that:
1. Clearly distinguishes the main body of the doorhanger from the "expert" preferences (technical information and the ability to disable protection).
2. Provides an action button for disabling protection without making it too prominent or prone to thoughtless clicking.

See the Interaction spec (http://people.mozilla.com/~lco/ProjectSPF/Mixed_Content/Mixed_Content_Spec/) and attachments for the expanded doorhanger's contents and some ideas of how we would provide a subtle action button (some people were worried that displaying a link for disabling protection wouldn't really indicate to the user that they were performing an action.

*Note that "Technical information" will not be implemented for v1, so no need to include that link.

Mixed Content, extended doorhanger
This bug is blocking the mixed content implementation... is there anyone who plans to work on this (assignee is blank)?  What are the steps to get this design wrapped up?
Assigning to Shorlander since it's visual design work.
This is done.
