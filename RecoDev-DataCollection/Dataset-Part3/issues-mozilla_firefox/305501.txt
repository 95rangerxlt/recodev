tabs.xul uses the wrong accesskey entity for the 'loadInBackground' option.
It should be 'loadInBackground.accesskey' instead of
'loadBookmarksInBackground.accesskey' because 'loadBookmarksInBackground' is not
used in tabs.xul.

What makes me wondering is, that loadBookmarksInBackground is used a pref which
can not be set within the tabs prefs, but the l10n entities are available.

I think it should be in the tabs prefs otherwise it should be removed from l10n.

Reproducible: Always

Confirming. Requesting blocking since this has l10n implications.

Ronny, you need to request review from a particular person on your patch.

Ok, thanks. I was a unsure, what to fill in the requestee field.

Well, I don't know if it affects l10n, because the correct locale entity is
already there. ->
