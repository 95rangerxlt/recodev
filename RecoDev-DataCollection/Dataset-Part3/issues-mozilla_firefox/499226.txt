Follow up bug from bug 496472 (removing unneeded branding images) and bug 495250 (landing the new branding on Linux).  We can now remove these files since they are old and no longer used:

mozicon16.xpm
mozicon50.xpm

Patch v.1

Removes the mozicon[50|16].xpm reference from the tree, as well as a couple of xpm files from xulrunner.

I didn't remove document.png, because it looks like it's actually still used. :-(

See: browser/components/shell/src/nsGNOMEShellService.cpp#288, where it copies document.png to ~/.icons/firefox-document.png when you trigger the "set default browser" code. This seems kinda crappy, since it means icon updates should repeat the copy or the user has the old version floating around.
