I'm trying to use irccloud, when i disable chatzilla and load irccloud, i get a bar which has a message which sounds like a question.

1. There are no buttons
2. The flow control to actually do what it's talking about is unreachable because the button that should be used was removed in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a4e9c9c9dbf9

Yes, you can write browser-chrome mochitests for this. You may be able to look at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/general/browser_datareporting_notification.js for a reference although that test uses the global notification bar while this code doesn't.

The patch looks fine, but we should have a test that ensures this doesn't break again.

You should use the waitForCondition function here instead of setTimeout as it is a bit more robust with random timing changes.

You know that's not always the case :) Lack of test coverage is a valid reason to withhold r+/prevent a patch from landing - in the case of a regression fix obviously the bar is a little different, and good judgement should prevail. I have no issue what with happened here, but I don't want your comment to be misinterpreted.
Yes, that is precisely why I waited to grant r+ until after I saw the tests. And sometimes while writing a test people realize that the other code needs to be changed.

I see that this bug has a mochitest. Is there any need for manual testing here? 
I actually did test this manually and I found that when Add Application appears you have to click on that twice so it disappears completely. Is this normal?
Dropping verifyme for now.
uplift nom please, with risk assessment.
lsblakk,
we must land this where ever I broke it.  basically, very simple patch with little risk at all.  if we don't take it, than it means that web sites can't define protocol handlers!

That's fine - just nominate the patch(es) that are need for approval-mozilla-beta ? since that's the remaining branch marked affected.

[Triage Comment]
going to approve this for mozilla-beta uplift without an official nomination given Doug's comment provides risk assessment and we want this for the second-to-last beta on Monday.
