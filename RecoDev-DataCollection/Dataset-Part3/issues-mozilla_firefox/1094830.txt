Screencast showing the issue

STR:
1. Open Firefox Developer Edition.
2. Open new tabs until the '+' button (open a new tab button) reaches the right edge.
3. Click on '+' button to add more tabs.

Expected result: The button does not shake.

Actual result: Button shakes if it`s clicked after it reaches the right edge of FF until navigation arrow buttons appear, after that happens it returns to normal.

I also noticed that on Ubuntu the '+' button is colored blue, is this intended?

Notes:
1. This issue reproduces on Windows and Ubuntu only.
2. Not reproducible on Mac OS X.

That's what happens even on lightweight themes on linux.  Take a look at bug 940326 for more information

Thanks for the report, are you talking about the icon subtly moving location during the click, or the button itself disappearing from under the mouse once the 'all tabs' button shows up?
I can reproduce this, it must be because of the selectors we use for the tabs.

*tab separators.

I doubt that it is the tab separators, since that is now just changing the background-image and no longer changing widths/margins like the original version did.

I`m talking about the button moving during the click.
I believe I've tracked this down when looking at 1093820.  Basically, there is a custom width on .tabs-newtab-button and #new-tab-button.  I think we only want that set on .tabs-newtab-button (at least on Windows).

There were a few things going on here:
1) There was a margin: 0 that was meant to override the 1px margin-bottom from @tabToolbarNavbarOverlap@.  The problem is it wasn't applied to all buttons that have that overlap.  I've moved that into it's own more specific and limited rule.  (I know this still isn't totally ideal, but until bug 1091001 I think it's an improvement)
2) There was a width of 35px set to #TabsToolbar > #new-tab-button and .tabs-newtab-button. First of all, that should only have been set to .tabs-newtab-button (since the #new-tab-button is skinnier when overflowing in Windows).  Secondly, that width should have been 36 (66px from tabs.inc - 30px for the tab curves).
3)  There was an !important on the background-image rule, but as best as I can tell it is because of :hover rules like this: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/tabs.inc.css#269.  By moving it into the :hover rule I got rid of the !important.

I've checked on osx, windows 7 aero / classic / basic, and ubuntu and there is no more shaking in them.

Would you mind converting https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/tabs.inc.css?rev=3adeab7e472d#319 to a calc() using @tabCurveWidth@ so we would catch this in the future?
Does this mean we can remove the other workaround for jittering that landed yesterday?

Using calc() in tabs.inc.css to make sure we don't miss this in the future

I think that was still an issue even with this fix, but I'll double check.

Nope, sadly still jittering if I set the width back to 0px even with this fix.  It's unfortunate because now I realized that the 2px fix makes the selected tab look a little weird in windows / linux (it's not directly lined up with the side of the browser window anymore).
Sorry, I thought you realized that was a side-effect.
