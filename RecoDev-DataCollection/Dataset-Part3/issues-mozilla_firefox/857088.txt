When I was working on bug 813802, I was using this image for reference:

It's possible I misunderstood, but I seem to recall shorlander saying that the top of the tab-strip needs to be 4px away from the bottom of either the menubar or the window buttons (just choose the "lowest" one).

Following up with shorlander to confirm.

So I talked with shorlander, and this screenshot demonstrates the proper behaviour:

When the window buttons are taller than the menubar, the 4px distance should be between the tabstrip and the buttons.

This puts the 4px gap back between the tabstrip and the window buttons when the window buttons are larger than the menu.
I just checked with shorlander - the 4px gap is always supposed to be there in restored window mode, regardless of whether or not the menu is showing.
