Patch to enable autoFill for URLBar

This allows for the auto-fill to be set via a preference.
I'll confirm this one and bug #203754 so the devs can have a look on it...

=> confirming and setting All/All
Taking QA. Sorry for the bugspam
After applying the patch (with fuzz) and building Firebird the pref
browser.urlbar.autoFill does not show up in about:config as I would have
expected. If I put that pref into my user.js and set to true it does indeed
enable autofill in the url bar (yay). Perhaps a change to all.js is needed as
well? If that's the case then the appropriate place for that change is bug
186136, since a decision on true/false would have to be made. If not and
something else needs to be changed then the appropriate place is here.
i'll have to update the patch do add it to the all.js.

Patch to enable autoFill for URLBar

Brian: Can you take a look at this and decide if we want this? Both IE and Moz
have it, so I suspect so.

Ben:

Could you take a look at this patch and decide if we want this?
I've wanted FB to have inline autocomplete for a while, but I don't like this patch.

It makes sense for the drop-down autocomplete to be the most recently or most
often viewed pages, or perhaps all matching pages in alphabetical order. But I
think IE did a better job with inline autocomplete in that it only autocompletes
up to the first "/". If you want more filled in after, you hit right-arrow and
start typing more, and it then fills in to the next "/". Otherwise, if you want,
for example, www.amazon.com, and you get an address with a whole string of crap
after that, it's a pain to then have to get rid of that crap to finally get to
the page you want.

I dunno if this is feasible for FB, but I thought it might just be something to
think about.

You're obviously only familiar with IE implementation, not with the much wiser
one in Mozilla Seamonkey. When using the latter only the most common URL is
displayed in the address bar, in your case, that would be www.amazon.com without
any additions. Try it, and you'll be amazed at how useful it is (it's still one
of the only bugs that keep me from upgrading to Firebird)

i don't have the time at the moment to go monkeying around with another browser,
so i'll take your word for it, Prog. Still, it's clear this patch to give FB
inline autocomplete is not quite on par with other methods out there. But that
raises the question: if Seamonkey can do it so well, why can't FB have the exact
same functionality?

Another thing I noticed with it is that it doesn't like to remember links you
click, only you type. Though as my amazon example showed, it has no problem
remembering links you're redirected to. Not a great combination, in my mind.
This patch, along with setting:

user_pref("browser.urlbar.autocomplete.learning.mode", 2);

to enable the learning machine provides the same functionality that Mozilla has,
which is far superior to what IE provides.
Seems like your complaint is a little off-topic.

This patch merely enables filling in the first result from the drop-down in the
URL bar.

If the order of the URLs in the URL bar are sub-optimal, that seems like a
seperate bug.

I agree that the ordering should be fixed, but it just confuses the issue to
talk about it on this bug.
It wasn't off topic at the time, because I was talking about making the
autocomplete function behave differently from the drop down menu, which *would*
be considered an issue with the autofill patch. But you're probably right. Are
there already any plans that you know of to monkey with the ordering of the drop
down menu?

Thanks, Robert, for pointing out the learning mode. I have a feeling FB
autocomplete will work a lot better for me now.
There are plenty of other Autocomplete bugs:

Bug 186136 Comment 17
[bug 186136] is now about adding a UI access point to browser.urlbar.autoFill and
whether or not to set it on by default. Bug 203756 is about adding the pref itself.


not a blocker, this doesn't even have a decision on whether it is going to be
supported period
David P James, your patch has a "bryner: review?" flag for more than 8 months.
How about asking someone else to review it? with 26 votes, this is a highly
wanted feature that shouldn't be Seamonkey-only.

Prog.
Redirecting my suggestion to Eric Lindvall who is the cretor of the patch. 

Sorry for the spam, but since a patch *is* available and waiting for review, I'd
hate to see it lost in oblivion.

Prog.

PS.
Also related: Bug 186136 ("best match as you type"/inline autocomplete is
missing in Firebird) -> 32 votes
I don't know who i should be giving this to.

Everyone I've tried to review it hasn't ever responded.
Try http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html and if that doesn't help, then the
quickest way to find out would be mozilla at irc://moznet

Prog.

You don't need to reviewer-shop.  Someone will get to it when they have time. 
Each developer has a long bugzilla queue and some things are higher priority.
Should I wait until it's been 1 year? 2 years?
It is called bitrot and it is known to happen.  Your best bet is to try to catch
someone on IRC.  Just changing the flag won't make anything happen.

So what do i need to do about it now? =)

Patch to enable autoFill for URLBar

This is going to cause the JS observer to stay alive until the browser shuts
down, since you never call removeObserver.  This will mean the JS global object
will also leak.  You need to call removeObserver in an appropriate place.  (You
can double-check this with the ++DOMWINDOW and --DOMWINDOW printfs in debug
builds.)

This patches against the latest firefox tree and makes required calls to
removeObserver().

good work, r=mconnor@myrealbox.com

I don't see inline autocomplete in the May 6th or 7th builds, and I do have
browser.urlbar.autoFill = true in my config.  Is there something I'm doing wrong?

You're correct. I realize now there isn't an entry in the config js (is that
all.js?)

you'll have to set it in your user.js:
user_pref("browser.urlbar.autoFill", true);

or via about:config
Not sure what you mean, but anyway, I've removed the reference from prefs.js and
put it into user.js, but no difference.

Mike Coppins,

I just downloaded and installed 20040508 for Windows.  Inserted the
browser.urlbar.autoFill property via about:config.  It works fine for me. 
Perhaps you want to try a clean install with fresh profiles?

As a side note, is it possible to extend this functionality to all the fields
(e.g. search bar, web forms)?
Yup, thanks, found the problem.
