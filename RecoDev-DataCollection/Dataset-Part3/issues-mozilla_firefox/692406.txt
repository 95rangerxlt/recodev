Until the debugger is ready to ship, we should hide it under a hidden pref (devtools.debugger.enabled) from the moment we merge with m-c. This toggle should default to false until it is decided that the debugger is ready for broader testing.

Works as advertised!
I missed that you have kept a default of true, which was not what we intended to do, but now that I think of it, we may want to have people try it on nightlies and give us feedback. Dave what do you think?

After the recent highlighter incident, it seems prudent to stick to disabled by default, so I did that.
