Currently, the inspector / highlighter actors require several messages to be exchanged to shut down properly.  We should change this so that the actors shut down correctly without requiring client messages.

As a user visible symptom of this today:

1. Use the inspector to highlight element on an FxOS device
2. Unplug device with highlighter visible
3. The highlighter remains on screen

The server is aware of when the connection dies, so we should ensure these actors shut down and remove things like highlighters when that happens.

Today, we appear to send the message "hideBoxModel" to achieve this, and it ends up left on screen if that message is not received.

Alex, maybe you are doing this in your recent work?
Oh! Yes I'll at least do some of these cleanups. I already have a patch for the hideboxmodel.

Alternatively, could we manage this inside the toolbox's destroyInspector method, which already deals with highlighter destruction: called https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/framework/toolbox.js#1759?

From there we could call

if (!this.highlighter.traits.autoHideOnDestroy) {
  this.highlighterUtils.unhighlight()
}

In that case we could completely remove the call to _hideBoxModel here, and it may also handle cases where the highlighter was shown from a different tool.  Not sure if it would mess up timings since the tool's destroy is fired before destroyInspector in the toolbox, but it seems like it may be a better place to put it.  Up to you

It seems to work correctly if I move this code to toolbox.js...
let's see if try is happy with that:
