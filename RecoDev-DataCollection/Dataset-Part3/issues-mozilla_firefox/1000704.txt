Patch v1: don't display the navigator-toolbox bottom border in customize mode

Matt, I added an attribute setter for gNavToolbox, because I didn't want to add another descendant selector that might regress a Talos suite.

The problem isn't that the border is present, it's that it extends too far. I don't think we want to remove the bottom border as that's just trading one bug for arguably a bigger one: http://grab.by/wliw

You're completely right, of course.

What about this version?

Well, where did these numbers come from? Trial and error?

On second thought, I don't like adding JS to make the selector prettier.

I'll up a patch without JS and we'll see if it affects cart perf.

Did you consider just putting the new rule "#main-window[customize-entered] #navigator-toolbox::after" above this one?
