Some elements of certain web sites are visible on other sites in tabs. See the
URL for a visual on this. snapshot1.jpg shows a page, then when a new tab is
opened to (in this example, Google News) a new page, some elements of the prior
tab are visible and persistent in the second and subsequent tabs. The anomalies
disappear only when the offending page's tab is closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page to a heavily graphic-laden page, such as abcnews.com
2. Allow all elements to resolve
3. Open a new tab to a different page

Actual Results:  
Some graphic elements (macromedia, etc.) are consistently displayed in
subsequent tabs showing other pages. Scrolling that second tab page up and down
scrolls the anomalous element as well (it remains in the same position as it is
in the tab beneath it).

Expected Results:  
Keep one page's elements on its own tab.

Could you test it with a latest nightly trunk (1.8a) build?
I experimented more, deleting my Codeweavers Crossover Pro installation, and the
problem disappeared. Further investigation shows this is a bug if you install
the Windows versions of the Flash and Shockwave plugins on top of, or instead
of, the Linux versions.
