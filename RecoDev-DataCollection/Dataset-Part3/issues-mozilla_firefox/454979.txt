This might be effecting all search boxes, since it is a common control that we use.  If so, then definitely [polish-high-visibility]
The appearance appears to be correct on OS X 10.4
I don't see it on Win XP either.

restore css padding

It seems this is Vista only and Library only issue, other search boxes are fine. 

This patch makes it look like any other search box, this code has been removed in bug 449375, so restoring and adjusting a little bit.

restore css padding

nit: 0 instead of 0px

And the padding you're adding should take RTL into account.

But are you sure this is all needed? Please try if this works:

#searchFilter {
  padding-top: 3px;
  padding-bottom: 2px;
}

And please add a brief comment explaining why we're doing this.
This also needs to be tested with a Classic theme.

add css padding

OK, this is default theme only issue, classic is fine even without this patch applied. This patch works fine with both default and classic theme.
