patch v.1

In applications.js, describePreferredAction & rebuildActionsMenu pull the name for various types of handers from nsIHanderInfo's preferredApplicationHandler name property. This traces to nsLocalHandlerApp's GetName, which returns the LeafName instead of the full application name.

patch v.1

Hmm, this seems like a good fix, although I wonder if we should make nsILocalHandlerApp::name return the full application name rather than the leaf name.
Biesi, dmose: should we make nsILocalHandlerApp::name return the full application name instead of the leaf name?  The full name seems more useful in the Applications prefpane context at least (and would mean the prefpane controller wouldn't have to retrieve the full names itself).

patch v.1

Requesting approval for this low-risk polish fix that improves the appearance and comprehensibility of application names in the Applications prefpane.
Yes, the current behavior is really a bug in nsLocalHandlerApp, given how
nsIHandlerApp.name is defined.  This will be hard to fix until
nsLocalHandlerApp can do per-platform overrides.  That change is coming in bug
394483.

Landing the patch here as a temporary workaround would be reasonable, though. 
If that happens, I'd suggest keeping this bug open to do the more correct fix
after the patch in bug 394483 lands.

Sorry, somehow I missed comment 4.  Reopening to do the more correct fix after the patch in bug 394483 lands.

Hmm, I just noticed that we need to check if the preferred application handler is a local app as well before calling getDisplayNameForFile on it in _describePreferredAction.  Here's a patch that makes that change.

> Should this be marked FIXED?

Quoting comment #9, "Leaving this open for the more correct fix per comment 4."
Maybe someone can give this a priority, I'm not sure what it should be targeting. I'll probably be able to fix this pretty quickly though (prior to M10).
This probably shouldn't be a blocker at this point, so the right thing to do is probably to let this slide to post Firefox-3 and work on blockers rather than giving this a priority.  :-/
I'm rolling the new name impl in with 400852 since I need the proper name for the protocol dialog. Undoing the temp fix will still be open here.
Looks like both patches landed is that right?  If so can we close the bug?
Does bug 400852 cover all the "hackiness cleanup" needed here? If not, can you file a new bug to track that? Bug morphing after a patch has already landed just leads to trouble.
Sure, this can be closed.
