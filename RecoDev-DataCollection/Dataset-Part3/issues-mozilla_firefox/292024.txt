This works for me using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050425 Firefox/1.0+ . This was probably fixed in a nightly build.
You're right Gabriel.  I had downloaded Firefox 1.0+ but managed to forget to
install it and was trying it on the latest public release 1.0.3.  Any idea when
1.0+ will be a stable release?
This summer i think... Just manage to find the roadmap to 1.1 that what you are
looking for. I think a develloper release should be out soon.
