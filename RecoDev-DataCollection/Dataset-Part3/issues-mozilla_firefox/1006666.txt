It is my observation and strong opinion that we're much, much (!) too eager to show the variables inspection popup. There's simply too many times when a user's intention is to select something, and have the popup get in their way. I've been burned and annoyed by this, and I've seen people being burned and possibly annoyed as well. Sure, giving more thought to fixing bug 943341 is a good idea, but that still doesn't address the fact that the debugger is much too eager to display the popup in the first place. Even more, most of the other editors/IDEs seem to wait for at least twice/thrice the amount of time we're waiting before showing the popup.

Chrome seems to take more than a second.
I think 750 might be a bit too much. Maybe 500 ?

Moreover, we should try to fix the real issues which make the popup hinder the user actions, when the user did not expect the popup to be open.
