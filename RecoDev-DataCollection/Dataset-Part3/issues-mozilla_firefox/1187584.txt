Because it's unportable, and the resulting cross-document node adoptions are quite slow. This reduces rule view update times by ~5-10% in my tests.

green try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=e0e4caf27df7

I could remove the " || Services.appShell.hiddenDOMWindow.document;" if wanted; the only reasons not to is that a test lacked a reasonable document to pass in, and the mentality that I still keep from Firebug never to change a public API. (Though mxr-addons doesn't show any hits, so eh.)

Yes, please remove it... you will need to run it through try again but everybody knows I hate these hiddenDOMWindow 'cos it is always a hack.
