Aligning the first two items in both panes

The first two items in the right and left panes of the Firefox menu should be vertically aligned.

The third item and downward in the right pane will then no longer be aligned due to the first splitter after "Start Private Browsing" but we should start with the first two lined up.

patch

This patch fixes the problem by adding padding to the left pane to match the existing padding in the right pane. While I was modifying the padding, I decided to increase the padding on all sides of the app menu panes to better match this mockup: https://bug583386.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=465479. This would also fix bug 610940. Alex, is this the correct change? I will attach a screenshot.

Oh, I just noticed bug 610924. This fix should probably go over there.

looks good for addressing the vertical alignment of menu items.  In terms of padding, we could collapse all of those bugs together, top and bottom should be 9px [1] (this increases to 12 top and 11 bottom).  And the icon edge to the left edge should be 7px [2] (this increases to 10 left pane and 9 right pane)

+ in terms of this specific bug, if we want to tweak padding see the comment above for new values.

This patch fixes the alignment issue by fixing the padding in the app menu. It also fixes a bunch of other padding-related bugs, which I'll dupe to this.

Hm, maybe #appmenuPrimaryPane shouldn't have -moz-margin-end: -1px;? Not sure what that's doing.
That negative margin makes the secondary pane overlap with the border, which seems strange because that border is being explicitly set. If I delete both the margin and the border rules the menu looks exactly the same. It seems like these rules may just be the result of iterating on the style for the original app menu patch. Should I just delete them?

Also, the border rule in #appmenuSecondaryPane doesn't seem to be necessary either.

Yes.

  padding: 2px;
  -moz-padding-start: 3px; ?

DÃ£o knows more about this than me, but I believe it's less efficient to do this because it would probably evaluate the padding declaration for all sides, then have to override one of those styles with -moz-padding-start.

I checked in the current patch:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/eaecf12fbf6e
FWIW, the perf difference should be negligible (and "parse two rules and override one" may actually be slightly more efficient than "parse 4 rules"), so picking the most concise is generally best.
After the land of this patch there is a grey line between the primary pane and the secondary pane of the Firefox menu that covers the blue shadow. It's a bug?

Yes, thanks for noticing this regression. I filed bug 617051 to fix it.
