When I look at this feed: http://planet.mozilla.org/rss20.xml , mr Smedberg seems to say weird things, so I want to change the encoding but the page doesn't react.
When I run in in the old pretty print in Firefox 1.5.3 however, I see the right text: It’s not Bias, It’s Discrimination.

minimum font-size set to 14

This becomes really ugly when you set a minimum font-size of 14 in Options > Content > Fonts & Colors > Advanced.

Sorry, posted in the wrong bug :(

wfm. planet has encoding problems. Not sure changing the encoding will help here, since the feed preview will always be utf-8.

This piece of French text looks alien. A big part of the words look like curses. Sounds very weird to me if this can't be solved.
Well, there's "can't be solved" and then there's "that's not the way to solve it."

Filed bug 339409 against planet.m.o, which is sending UTF-8 as text/xml with no charset param and no encoding in the XML decl, probably the very worst possible way to send XML.

Rob, am I guessing right from our mangled characters, that we're using ISO-8859-1 as a default in the absence of a charset? That doesn't seem like a very happy choice, if we can avoid it.

I suspect we are sniffing it, as there are cp-1252 characters near the beginning.

I will try that feed with those chars edited out.

OK, planet is totally busted, but we can do better.

Use TryDocumentCharset the way nsXMLDocument does

Phil wins. That's exactly what was happening, if I understand nsParser. This patch  will silently drop the 1252 characters (there were only a few), just like our view-source view does (fair enough, they are control characters in utf-8).

This looks a lot like just doing |rv = InitParser(mParserObserver, channel);| always :)

Please switch these two around, that makes it easier to read IMHO.

With both those fixed, r=me

Too bad we can't share this :-(.

This can go on one line.
