During the customize mode transition on OS X, the tabs will briefly touch the top of the window before being placed in their final position.

This is a pretty awful experience. We should address this.

Yes, I think this is definitely better than what we've got. This, plus a solution to bug 933933, and the transition should feel a lot less bumpy.

Thanks Blake!
