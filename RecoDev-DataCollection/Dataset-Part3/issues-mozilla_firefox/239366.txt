All official linux gtk2 enabled nightly builds released after March 27th
segfault on startup with the message '/opt/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 451:
10731 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}'. I'm running Fedora Core 1 but have
installed some packages from the development branch (including the latest glibc
ones). Removing the file "components/libqfaservices.so" (a hint by firefox
developer bryner) makes the builds work again so I guess this might indeed be
talkback related.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
output: 
/opt/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 451: 10731 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}


Expected Results:  
Firefox starts up normal.

This seems to be talkback related as it only happens with talkback enabled
builds and removing the file "components/libqfaservices.so" makes Firefox start
fine again. All builds before March 28th work without making any changes.

I tested on FC2 test 2 (actually, it's an update of the development tree from
about 2 days before test 2 was released).  Firefox started fine and I was able
to send a talkback incident.  So I don't know that the development versions of
the packages are to blame here.

Has anyone who is seeing this problem enabled any nonstandard options relating
to pthreads, glibc, or the kernel? Or enabled any extra security restrictions or
OS stack overflow protection?

Confirming on my setup of Fedora Core 1
Can also confirm with my FC1 with a 2.4.25 custom kernel, deleting the 
libqfaservices.so file fixes the Segmentation fault, 
valgrind points to a potential problem on my FC1 machine, though no crash:

==2514== Source and destination overlap in strcpy(0xbfffd299, 0xbfffd29b)
==2514==    at 0x4000C81B: strcpy (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgskin_memcheck.so)
==2514==    by 0x4342F68F: FCSanitizePath(char*) (in
/home/bryner/firefox/components/libqfaservices.so)

and I was, for whatever reason, able to reproduce the crash a few minutes later
on the FC2 machine. gdb's backtrace points to FCModuleManager::FindRange, though
the stack looks like it could be corrupted.

I'll see what we can do about getting this fixed in the talkback client library.

I checked in a patch that fixes the valgrind warning, and thus perhaps the crash.
Can someone who is seeing the crash test the 2004-04-01-19 build or newer and
report on whether it still crashes? Thanks.
Ok, it appears there is still a crash.  Will keep investigating.
It looks like the real cause of the crash here is related to the prelinking
feature on Fedora.  The client code is not dealing correctly with system
libraries that have been adjusted by the prelink utility.  With luck we'll be
able to get a fix for this soon. (This may explain why some people see the
problem and some don't -- the exact base addresses prelink chooses depends on
what all you have installed, I believe)
Sorry I never got back sooner,  
Yes I can confirm as you have since post that the crash still happens, tested 
with : 
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040402 Firefox/0.8.0+ 
As far as I am aware my system does use prelinking, 
clarifying summary and removing bogus url (still working on getting a new build
of the talkback libraries with this bug fixed)
Adding crash keyword.

For a temporary workaround until this bug is fixed, you can edit
/etc/sysconfig/prelink to say PRELINKING=no and then either wait until the next
time the prelink is run on its own, or run the following command as root:
"/usr/sbin/prelink -ua". To re-enable prelinking at any time, just set
PRELINKING=yes again in /etc/sysconfig/prelink and the system will automatically
start to prelink stuff again on its own.
Yep, can confirm that setting PRELINKING=no and running "prelink -ua" allows me
to run the current gtk2 enabled builds without deleting libqfaservices.so
The WINE project ran into similar problems, and has started to solve it with a
custom loader.  Here's a link to it:

    http://www.winehq.com/hypermail/wine-devel/2004/04/0193.html

It's not clear whether this is the right solution, but it's interesting
information to have.

bryner, is this something you can get to for 0.9?
(In reply to comment #14)
> bryner, is this something you can get to for 0.9?

This should definitely be a 0.9 blocker, because we really should try and ship
0.9 with talkback enabled. At the time of release (depending on how quickly we
get it out), Fedora Core 1 may still be the stable Fedora Core release. Even if
its not, Fedora Core 2 will *just* have been released at around the same time
(~May 17). Thus Fedora Core 1 will still be one of the most popular Linux
distributions around. If talkback doesn't work on it, then we shouldn't ship
with talkback.

It would look very bad if mozilla.org shipped Firefox 0.9 with talkback and it
didn't even start up on Fedora Core 1.

Please give this a try with tomorrow's trunk nightly (2004-05-07).  It has a new
drop of the talkback binary which should fix the problem.
OK I just grabbed latest trunk: 
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040509 Firefox/0.8.0+.
gunzipped and started FireFox no problems on my FC1 system. Assuming this build
has Talkback? (I cant find libqfaservices.so) it works for me.. Look forward to
the gtk2 + xft builds.

I just downloaded the official 2004-05-11 installer build, which has
libqfaservices.so and it started up fine on my FC1 system.

Yep, this is fixed for me on Fedora Core 1.
