This tests creates a cURL command and copies it to the clipboard [0]. I manually verified that the created string is the expected one, however `clipboardHelper.copyString` doesn't seem to work on e10s [1]. Disabling the test for now, but the thought here is that it's not the test's or tool's fault.
