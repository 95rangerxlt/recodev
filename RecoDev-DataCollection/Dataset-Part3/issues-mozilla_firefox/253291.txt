Seen on linux branch build 2004-07-27-08-0.9

-make a change to any pref. (tested with homepage and number of days for history
to remember)
-click Okay to prefs dialog
-restart app.  

tested results: A save error dialog appears on Okay to prefs window. 
Message: Failed to save the preferences file. Any preferences changes will be
lost ant the end of this session. And, in fact, the change to pref is lost on
restart.

expected results:
the change to the pref is retained after restart.

Note: Windows build of same time stamp works as expected.

Fix is checked in (browser/installer/unix/browser.jst rev 1.2 / 1.1.4.1) -- this
was only affecting new profiles created using a build installed with the
installer wizard on Linux.
Tree reopened. Thanks bryner.

Just in case we need it for tbird too
this looks good in 2004072814-0.9 (firefox aviary1.0 branch) on linux. will
check trunk in a bit.
matching thunderbird changes fixed on the branch and the trunk.
...also looks fine with 2004072812-trunk firefox bits (linux fedora core 1).
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
