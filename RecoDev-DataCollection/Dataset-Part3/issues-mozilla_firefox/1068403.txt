Luís: sorry, I CC'd you on the wrong add-on bug. <:)

hi Vit: are you the maintainer Appteligent's Video Resumer add-on?

Error log
Yes, I am the maintainer of the extension. I will take a look at it over coming weekend. Meanwhile, I also noticed, some other extensions did not work under Nightly.

If your other extensions are not listed on our http://arewee10syet.com/ ("Are We e10s Yet?") website, just let me know (if they work) or please file a bug (if they don't). I can update the website, which we use to help testers find more extensions to be tested.
The newest unreviewed version fixes this.
The new version is now live on AMO.
