I hit a leak when trying to land bug 1186662.

This can be reproduced using:
./mach mochitest --e10s browser/base/content/test/general/browser_tab_drag_drop_perwindow.js

You get:
JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml, line 4207: NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebProgress.removeProgressListener]

This was coding my code afterwards to not run. For now I'm working around this by having my code run after this is thrown but we need to fix this properly.

How does this work when `dom.ipc.processCount` is greater than 1? The tabs won't necessarily be in the same process.

Hmm, that comment is misleading, I see. We can't swap frameLoaders when one is in the UI process and one is in a content process. With bug 918634 fixed we should be able to swap between two different content processes though.

r+ with this comment changed to:
// Can't swap between chrome and content processes.
