Proposed patch.

Currently, the Web Console (headsUpDisplay.css) has no theme for Linux. Rather it uses the Windows one. This will be a problem for the close button (bug 581231).

The attached patch fixes this.

New patch fixes the copyright header, sorry about that.
You can |hg cp| the theme file to preserve its history (and make the patch easier to review).

[checked-in] Proposed patch (trunk rebase 2010-08-10).

Rebased to trunk. Only issue was that my name was already added to the file credits, so I assume this doesn't need re-review?

backed out in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5f699108f3cf
this was probably not the culprit, but after backing one patch out, we thought it best to back the whole set out for analysis.

I'm almost certain it's not the cause of any leaks or CSS regressions: it's just copying one file from winstripe/ to gnomestripe/.
