The debugger head.js imports helpers.js which uses promises from GCLI, and they happen to overwrite the promises imported directly by head.js.

The solution could be to give the promises variable in helpers.js a different name, or to change the order of imports in the debugger head.js.

There are 3 parts to this the first adds a module to helpers.js so it doesn't leak variables everywhere. The second converts old promises to the new "new Promise" format, and the third is a small change that moves toDom from util to host which helps us fix a bug in using GCLI from the command line.

This update adds a definition of 'Promise' and 'require' to the head.js files that were using helpers.js and relying on it to define Promise/require.

I sure wish splinter had --word-diff=color... it would have greatly improved reviewing changes to indentation and small changes promise > Promise.

Looks concise and solid to me, r+.
