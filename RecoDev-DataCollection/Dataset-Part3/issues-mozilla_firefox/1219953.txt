MozReview Request: Bug 1219953 - Consider Markup View autoscroll finished only if the view has not scrolled for 30 consecutive frames. r?pbrosset

Bug 1219953 - Consider Markup View autoscroll finished only if the view has not scrolled for 30 consecutive frames. r?pbrosset

Waiting for 50ms and checking if the scrollTop has changed does not
necessarily mean that the scrolling has stopped (or even started). It
might also mean that a GC has blocked the autoscroll interval from
running and the scrolling will happen in a few moments. If the view
hasn't even started to scroll, the assertion that the view has scrolled
fails. If the view has started to scroll, the next call to
waitForViewScroll() might resolve when before the direction of the
scrolling is reversed causing the assertions that the direction has
changed to fail.

Instead of relying on intervals to detect if scrolling has stopped, the
test could wait for a certain number of frames during which the view
has not scrolled to determine if the scrolling has ended. This method has
successfully been used in layout/base/tests/test_scroll_snapping.html
to detect when scrolling has stopped.

These changes make browser_markupview_dragdrop_autoscroll.js to use the
previously presented method to detect the end of markup-view autoscroll.
The code used in the layout test has been included in the test and
modified to yield and use promises when waiting for a frame.

The changes should fix bug 1219490 too.
