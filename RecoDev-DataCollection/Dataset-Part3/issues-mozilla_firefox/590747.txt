The fonts used through @font-face do not render.

This regression seems to have been introduced in Firefox 4 Beta 1 and continued all the way to Beta 4. This problem only occurs on OSX, I have confirmed it is not present in either Windows XP or Ubuntu 10.04 using Firefox 4 Beta 4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://typekit.com/fonts/scheme and notice that the font sample doesn't render.



Expected Results:  
Visit http://typekit.com/fonts/scheme in Firefox 3.6.8

Originally I thought the problem was limited to fonts with CFF outlines but the example url actually contains a font with TrueType outlines.
I mistakenly thought WOFF was being served when in fact it is not.
