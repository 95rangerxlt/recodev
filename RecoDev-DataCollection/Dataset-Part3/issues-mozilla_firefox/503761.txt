In Private Browsing mode, or when Firefox is set to never remember any history, no new passwords will be saved. But the "Remember passwords for sites" check box in the Security panel is nevertheless enabled. You can check and uncheck it, as if you had a choice whether passwords should be saved or not.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start a private browsing session, or set Firefox to never remember any history.
2. Go to Options/Preferences -> Security panel.
3. Make sure the "Remember passwords for sites" option is checked.
4. Visit a site that require login, and fill in your information. If you already have saved a password for the site, fill in a new password to trigger the "change existing password" prompt.

Result:
No prompt is displayed where Firefox offer to save the new login information

Yeah that's the same problem I'm having. How can I get it to save my passwords like it did with the previous version?

-THEBAUS
I too have been having this problem, I have an add-on installed for exporting and importing saved usernames/password combos, I thought this problem was attributed to that but I disabled it and still have the same problem. Is it possible to downgrade to an earlier version of firefox?

I have this problem too, it's a shame, Firefox 3.5 is so fast!
I don't see this on one of my systems.  But on two out of two systems with freshly installed OS X Lion, Firefox never remembers any credentials.  I do have "don't remember history" on, but I have that on the system that works, too.

This has been through versions 7 and 8.  Potentially relevant bug: 517383
Isn't "Never remember" the same as "Private browsing" from a practical viewpoint?

Browsing the source code, the history modes aren't real modes but sets of preferences. Depending of the value of this preferences, the history mode is said to be one of the three available.

patch 1 WIP

Work in progress.

The Private Browsing session detection code works, but the "Never remember" detection only works when it was selected when opening the dialog box (this is probably caused by the way it the settings take effect in some platforms).

Not my final proposed code, so I am not flagging it to be reviewed.
Created attachment 611542
patch

Same as previous Work-In-Progress attachment, but with a simpler source code.

To disable (make not clickable) the "save passwords" checkbox when it is useless, this new code checks if the browser is in a Private mode session right now or if user has setup the browser to "not remember history" in the Privacy Pane. This last action, in fact activates the Private mode for the session, and instructs the browser to "start in Private mode" next time it is executed.

If one of those conditions are true, then the check-box and its related button for exceptions will be disabled for user interaction.

Dao, could you take a look at this patch, please? Thank you.

As noted in previous comments, it would be better if options dialog updates instantly the preferences values.

Also, I run mochitests and get as a result 13 or 16 failed tests. I didn't find any related to the issue of this particular bug.

As discussed in bug 517383 you filed, this new problem is about the UI not making it clear that when the Private mode is activated, then the passwords won't be remembered. The interface shows a sentence where it says that selecting the "not remember history" option in the pop-up will, in fact, made the browser acts as if it was in Private mode.

Then: these comments are refering to another issue, not the one stated at the bug header.

You don't need the <preference> element, as far as I can see. You can just read the pref using the preferences service (Components.classes["@mozilla.org/preferences-service;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPrefBranch).getBoolPref).

I'm confused -- what exactly represents the "Don't remember history" setting here? browser.privatebrowsing.autostart is something different, as I understand it.
In privacy.js, function updateHistoryModePrefs, when the History mode selected item is "Don't remember", "browser.privatebrowsing.autostart" preference is set to true. Then, it seems to me that the way we could know if browser is in the "Don't remember mode" is to check that preference.

The other case is when "Remember history" is selected. Then, at the same code in privacy.js, the autostart preference is set to false.

In comment 0 it is said "in private browsing mode or when Firefox is set to never remember any history". For the first part, the patch queries the Private Browsing Service.

For the second part, it would be great to be able to know the value of the privacy.xul history mode list box, but I wasn't able to do this.

If there is no other way to do it, maybe it would be better to clarify the comments on the patch?

I hope this answers your question, Dao :-)

Check-box disabled in Private Browsing mode

This screenshot was taken when in Private Browsing mode and was built with attachment 615345 included.

When in this mode, the checkbox for the password preference is useless, so it is disabled.

I am asking for a review because maybe showing it could make the user think "Passwords will be remembered and I am not able to change this behavior".

Maybe another ways to fix this bug are:

a)hide both the checkbox, label and button

b)remove the checkbox and the button and showing instead a label stating something like "No new passwords are remembered while in Private Browsing or when 'Never remember history' is selected".

c)following with last patch, but add the explanation label in option b.

Sorry, because, as this is an UI related bug this comment should have been done some time ago.
"maybe showing it could make the user think "Passwords will be remembered and I am not able to change this behavior"."

Yes, that is what that screen shot would indicate to the user.  If passwords are not remembered in Private Browsing mode, why does the checkbox have a check in it?

Thanks for your work on this.
Dao: I am not cancelling the review of the patch. Waiting for the review from the UX-team, but after the comment from Gavin Stokes, it looks that this approach is not quite good.

Gavin: there would be a fourth possibility. It would be unchecking the checkbox and then disabling both the button and the checkbox itself. As the checkbox is linked with the signon.rememberSignons preference, unchecking it would switch it to a "false" state when the session is re-established to the Normal Browsing mode (don't know if this is its name, in fact).

I didn't mention it before, but the same will happen when the 'Never remember history' item is selected in the Privacy pane.
To work around the problem of the unchecked state being retained when Normal mode is reactivated, would it be possible to overlay the real checkbox with a "fake" unchecked one?  The fake one could safely be hidden when Normal mode is re-established, allowing the real state to show again.

I'm assuming there's some reason you can't just save the previous value of the checkbox and restore it when Normal mode resumes.  Is that true?

Yes, Gavin. I thought about adding a new preference that would contain the value of the checkbox before the browser switches to Private Mode, but I wasn't sure if it would be too much, you know, a new preference only because of this bug. Better try to fix this without touching the Private Mode code

patch with styling changes

Cancelling reviews as the code is being re-done. Sorry for the spam.
I will try it by moving the ode in the last patch to the readSavePasswords. With this change we could modify the UI without updating the preference value.

Once I had a running build a screenshot will be posted so the ux-team could review it, and if plused, the patch itself will follow :-)

Don't know if it is still needed to ask for a review from the UX tem, but... better to be sure. Also maybe they could provide us with another way to do things visually.

Created attachment 619143
patch

Disables both the checkbox and the Exceptions button in case browser is in Private Browsing mode or in the Never remember history.

In order to keep consistency visually, the checkbox is shown as not checked, but the preference value remains unchanged.

Note to the reviewer: I tested the functionality and also executed mozilla-browser-chrome mochitest suite. In the suite I normally get between 12 or 19 failed tests -difference is because of timed-out ones- in this and other bugs I try to fix in previous versions. Anyway, it would be fine, if source style and the code itself is ok, to run the suite to be sure of everything still ok. Thank you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, this should not depend on the current private browsing status, as this UI is about setting Firefox preferences, and should not be affected by temporary changes in the PB status.  But it does make sense to make this disabled in auto-started PB mode.  However, the correct way of checking this is to use the autoStarted property of the PB service <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/public/nsIPrivateBrowsingService.idl#17>, not examining the value of the pref directly.
Done the change in order to read the private browsing service member, not the preference value itself.

Then, if the UI is available while in a private browsing mode session -not autostarted with the application-, this could confuse the user.

Also, there is comment 29.

Go just with a patch only for half the description in comment 0?

I think that's fine...

> Also, there is comment 29.

We're not planning to remove the autoStarted property for per-window PB, only the privateBrowsing member.
