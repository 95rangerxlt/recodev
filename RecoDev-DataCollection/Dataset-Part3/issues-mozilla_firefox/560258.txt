I just looked at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Ochi_chernie.ogg and I realized that since it is opened as a standalone element, Firefox lists it as a Video, which Page Info forces to be 0px x 0px, which means that it can't be played.

Patch v. 1.0

I dropped the resizing of ogg videos, since it caused this problem, and since resizing of videos is probably very rare, this doesn't matter having it resized in the Page Info window in the way that it matters for images.

Besides it makes the code shorter...
