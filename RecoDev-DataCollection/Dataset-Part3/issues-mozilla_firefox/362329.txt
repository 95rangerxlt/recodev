Web Apps 1 has clarified the definition of rel="alternate stylesheet" and the use of rel="alternate" for feed autodiscovery.  It states:

| if it does also contains the keyword stylesheet, the alternate keyword instead
| modifies the meaning of the stylesheet keyword in the way described for that
| keyword, and the rest of this subsection doesn't apply.

That means the definition for autodiscovery which is specified later in that subsection does not apply and a link like this should not be discovered.

<link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="application/atom+xml" href="/feed1" title="alternate stylesheet">

For further explanation, see
http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-November/008054.html

This is also related to bug 362156.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="application/atom+xml" href="/feed1" title="alternate stylesheet">
2. Load it up and see if autodiscovery finds it.

(I tested this with the latest trunk as well)
Actual Results:  
The feed is discovered.

Expected Results:  
It shouldn't be.

check for a stylesheet rel

I think this is fine for now, but instead of regexs, we should probably split(" ") the rel value into hash keys if we ever get around to combining the onLinkAdded handlers.
