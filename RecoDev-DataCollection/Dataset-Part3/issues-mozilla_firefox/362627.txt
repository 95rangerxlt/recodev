The Mac customization sheet *would* be closed by VK_ESCAPE, VK_RETURN or VK_ENTER, except they are calling window.close(), which doesn't close that not-very-window, rather than gCustomizeToolbarSheet.done(), which does. I wouldn't worry too much about it (I was just going to fix it in bug 341246 as a side-effect), except that playing with bug 174518 made me notice that it's not too hard to get it in a state where the Done button doesn't show up, and it would be nice if hitting Esc at that point got rid of it, which makes me think we probably want it for 1.8.1.2.

It would help evaluate reward if I actually tested the branch: while the risk is low, since it's hard to break something that doesn't work at all, the reward isn't as high as I thought, since all the ways of winding up with a broken dialog/sheet and needing a keyboard shortcut to close it that I've seen are actually trunk-only.

Fix v.1

Approved for 1.8 branch, a=jay for drivers.
browser/base/content/customizeToolbarSheet.xul 1.2.2.2

Since I've done most of this bug backward, STR for QA:

1. Open the toolbar customization sheet on Mac, with View - Toolbars - Customize... or by right-clicking a toolbar - Customize...
2. Get focus into the customization sheet: clicking in it generally works, hitting Tab quite often works, dragging something into it nearly always works.
3. Pressing Esc, Return, or Enter should close the sheet, and save any changes you made.
verified on the 1.8 branch using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/20070111 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre. I used Phil's STR in Comment 6 and everything looks good. Adding verified keyword.
