Do you see any errors in the Browser Console about updates failing?

If you do go to the Add-on Manager, does the gear menu have "Update Add-ons Automatically" checked?  If you click the "more" link for the 2.1 add-on, what state is selected for the "Automatic Updates" setting of this add-on?
Yes, "update add-ons automatically" is checked.

Re errors in the browser console: when is the update process supposed to get started? What should I "search for" in the console? There are many errors and I do not know what to filter by!
Sole might be using a pre-release version of the simulator. The one we asked people to test 2 months ago.

Alex, how can Sole know if she is using a non-prod version of the simulator?
This discussion happened in bug 1053730.
There *must* be a way to know if the installed simulator is a pre-release simulator or not. If they are exactly identical, then the update should work.

... and this discussion is happening in bug 1078346.

Sole, can you go to your profile, and look at "updateURL" in: profile/extensions/fxos_2_1_simulator@mozilla.org/install.rdf
updateURL is https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/2.1/mac64/update.rdf
Created attachment 8500946
Simulator's install.rdf
Created attachment 8500947
inside the simulator folder, things seem "old"
Sole, the profile you use with WebIDE, is it your default profile? Sometimes, people use a special profile for development, and the firefox instance never runs long enough to update the simulator.
Alex, any magical idea?
It's my default profile. Nightly runs for days without restarting unless I remember to update it for the nightly updates :P
(In reply to Soledad Penades [:sole] [:spenades] from comment #2)
> Yes, "update add-ons automatically" is checked.

What about on this add-on specifically via the "more" link?  It seems unlikely that you would override the default, but just in case...  If you click the "more" link for the 2.1 add-on, what state is selected for the "Automatic Updates" setting of this add-on?

Here is a sample error I simulated by messing up local add-on's install.rdf:

1412692218612	addons.update-checker	WARN	Request failed: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/2.3/mac64/update.rdf - 404: Not Found

So, perhaps try searching for "update-checker".
(we should ask on the devtools mailing list if anybody else is stuck with this old version of the simulator)
I don't know what is wrong with your addon, but addon update works fine, really:
https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/2.1/mac64/
If you install the official build (the 2.1.20140918-mac64.xpi) and ask for update it does update.

Nightly build are now exactly the same than release builds, except on some platforms like linux 64 where the update URL is wrong because of difference in platform names (linux64 vs linux-x86_64).
JRyans: the 2.1. simulator addon is set to "default" i.e. no overrides.

Out of desperation I looked at permissions in the directory, they all seem OK (why would they not? I never ran sudo firefox!). But at this point I can't really think of anything else I can do :)

Should I uninstall and install again or do a force update or...?
If you want to debug this more, you would have to:
- set in about:config 'extensions.logging.enabled' to true,
- reboot firefox,
- open the browser console and clear its content,
- open about:addons,
- force an update (right click the addon, find update)
- look at what happens in the browser console.

If that happens to update the addon, that's a firefox issue, it has nothing to do with the simulator addon.
If that says the update url is wrong (404), you have a nightly build I gave to you to test the webcomponent breakage.
This just happened to me. 2.1 was stuck on July update. Manual check tells me:

https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/2.1/linux-x86_64/update.rdf - 404: Not Found
I looked at the last two 2.1 builds for both linux64 and mac64, but only linux64 was affected, and only the July build.

Regardless, we need a way for the update to work.  Alex, should we publish a symlink at the URL Paul listed?  Also, can we see what other builds might be affected?
This is only broken for some old linux 32 and 64 builds on 2.0 and 2.1.
It looks like I fixed that when switching to non-sdk addons in my release script...
We should be able to fix that with symlinks.

Symlinks created for linux 32/64 in 2.0 and 2.1 folders.
All update.rdf links are now valid, for all released addons.
(It may not be clear in previous comment, but the digit next to each URL is wget return code (0=OK, 8=error).
So, it looks like background add-on updates (but not manual updates) have been broken since Firefox 34... :/

I am working on this in bug 1090450.

Anyway, there's an explanation at least!
*rolls eyes* 8-)

I still haven't updated the simulator, waiting for this to autofix itself :-P
Sole confirmed today that she got an update after the fix for bug 1090450.

Yay! :D
