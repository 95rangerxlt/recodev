Can you reproduce with a new profile?
Build config issue with that build.  Will be fixed with new build today.
Wait, I thought this was just a build config thing, but the build does have the right activex options... I'm not sure what's going on here, will try to debug.
This should be resolved with the latest drop from 20090711; however, patches for this that need to land are in bug 503902 and bug 500472.
I have verified that flash is now working with the 20090711 drop.
