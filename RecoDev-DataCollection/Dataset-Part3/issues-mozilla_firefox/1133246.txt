Thanks for your interest !

You can get started by setting up your build environment, you can take a look at the documentation [0], or watch the video tutorials [1].
Once you've done so, generate a patch file that adds the code mentioned in comment #0 inside toolkit/themes/shared/in-content/info-pages.inc.css.
If you need help, you can join #introduction on IRC.

Yes, thanks. Asking review from someone who has review powers.
Your patch will be checked in, and once it lands on mozilla-central, it will appear on nightly the next day. :)
