STR:
1) Launch a 34 beta build
2) Switch to Yahoo in the search bar, restart Firefox, validate Yahoo still selected
3) Switch back to Google, restart Firefox, validate Google still selected
4) Change the prefs at https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/aa72ddfe9f93/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser-region/region.properties#l5 to make Yahoo the default search engine
5) Launch that modified build

Expected: now Yahoo is selected

Just tried those STR, works fine.

One set of steps that don't quite work the way I expect them to:
- in a build with Google as default, switch to Yahoo -> "Yahoo" user pref saved in search-metadata.json
- upgrade to a build that has Yahoo as a default -> user pref is not cleared (unless you switch away and switch back)

This is an edge case, and would only affect a scenario where we then change the default again. Since you did at one point make an explicit choice to switch to that engine, it's probably not worth worrying about.
