We're using the wrong URL in our built-in Twitter search engine.
With our current URL, Twitter incorrectly parses any query that contains a space.
For example, typing "hello world" (excluding those quotation marks) results in the Twitter query: hello+world

We can easily fix this by changing the URL from:
https://twitter.com/search/{searchTerms}
to:
https://twitter.com/search?q={searchTerms}

Fixing this will also make search result page detection much easier if we ever need it.

Kev, could you make sure that doing this doesn't break anything on Twitter's end, i.e. Twitter still recognizing that the search came from Firefox?

You should move the parameter to a <Param> element because that's what it's meant for and it'll be consistent with our other default engines. (e.g. https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/searchplugins/bing.xml#15 )

I agree with Matt. Otherwise this looks fine, and obviously the result is nicer - but IIRC Twitter specifically asked us to use this URL, so we need to get sign-off from them.

Oops! Good catch. I copied the line https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/searchplugins/google.xml#20 which was the wrong example to use.
Received confirmation this eve from Twitter that this change is approved/encouraged.
