Two issues here - 

1) The redist library vccorlib110.dll currently doesn't get included in the distribution.
2) To run as a metro enabled desktop browser, we rely on api-ms-win-core-* winrt runtime. The current win8 release doesn't include these bu default.

#1 is easy to address. #2 is a little strange. One guess is that they aren't distributing these files in the release previews but will in the final release of the os. 

Both of these issues are preventing set up pre-release win8 testing slaves which normally don't have visual studio installed.

I would suggest we fix #1 on elm, ping ms to confirm the runtime will be in the final release, and try to find some way of getting the pre-release runtime installed without installing visual studio.

Note found this through a search, not sure what this is but it looks promising:

FTR we might not be running the latest Win8 build:

"Windows 8 Consumer Preview: Evaluation copy. Build 8250"

Maybe I can ask IT to install the latest copy?
Confirmed that the Release Preview has the api-ms-win-core-* runtime installed. Morphing this bug.

Yep, we need to update these slaves to the release preview.
I have asked in bug 770953 for IT to re-image one of the machines.

Is there a workaround meanwhile?

For the consumer preview you would have to install visual studio I would think. Best option is to just upgrade to the release preview.  

For the vccorlib problem we need to land a patch on elm that adds vccorlib110.dll here -

patch

AFAICT there are two locations we need to mention this file.
https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/elm/rev/aeecd761a36d

I'll land this on mi once I've confirmed this dll is showing up in zip installs on elm.

I also had to add this file to the redist file copy logic in build/win32 -

This is working correctly on Elm now.
