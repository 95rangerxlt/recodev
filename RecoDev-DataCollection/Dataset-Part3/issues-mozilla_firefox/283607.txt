what preferences settings do you have for oscp? can you look in prefs.js and
tell me if anything is out of the ordinary?
I have no options set for oscp. I just tried this with a new beast build and a
new profile and the pulldown is populated and rendered properly when I go to the
Verification screen now, although with my old profile it is still wrong.

I swear I filed this after checking the build out on a new profile, but maybe I
didn't..
culprit seems to be security.OCSP.signingCA pref.  If set, seemingly to
anything, this occurs.  It also seems to not prefill the service URL for
most/all of the OCSP providers, and for those where it does, it doesn't seem to
set the pref right.

So yeah, its kinda broken.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
