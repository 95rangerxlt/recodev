Thanks, Francesco. Do the string names have to change even if it's still referring to the same thing? Was unfamiliar with this before, patch contains the string name change!

To answer your question with another question: why are you changing this in English? 
I think because it wasn't clear enough (especially "Web Audio Editor" -> "Wed Audio").

And changing the ID is the only way for localizers to notice this change and update their translations.

Review of attachment 8424158:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes look good, but it's better to have a real reviewer stamp them ;-)
The change in names was one because the tool name was too long, and another because most of the names in the dev tools panel describe a tool ("Console", "debugger"), but some are names of the topic in which they inspect ("Network"), so this was a way to shorten the name and have a more topic-based name rather than adding editor/inspector/debugger/etc'

Thanks for the look over Francesco, will have another reviewer! :)
