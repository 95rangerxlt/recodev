There is no reason we can't do this now, according to Axel leaving in a string or removing it has similar costs for l10n, so it's better removing them to avoid forgetting about it (see bug 630479 comment 20).
Asking approval at the same time since patch is trivial.

Axel, ok to proceed with pushing this? (Just asking because I noticed the "last string" message in the newsgroup)

We'll need to stop finding these, basically. But yeah, let's get this landed.
