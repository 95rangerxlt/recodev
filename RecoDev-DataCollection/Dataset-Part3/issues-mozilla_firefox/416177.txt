.tabbrowser-tab[selected="true"] {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

should be changed to

.tabbrowser-tab[selected="true"] {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  font-weight: normal;
}

or better, "font-weight" should be removed, since GTK indicates in visually easy way what tab is currently selected.

Jakub, please set version to Trunk.

Nominating as blocking since this differs with native application in one of the more prominent and visible areas of Fx: tabs.
I can confirm with:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008031103 Minefield/3.0b5pre
Changed version, as requested :) .

Removes the CSS that makes text bold on the selected tab

Was hoping this could be one of the bugs that got Jakub into making patches, but alas.  Fix is simple and allows me to remove a line from my userChrome.css file
Ian, paths in filesystem and in chrome:// are slightly different.

Creating patches is not hard work, however here I could have little problem (; .

Hopefully, some beautiful day I'll attach a patch (like in GNOME BZ) and probably notify you :P .

some ux-approval would be nice.

I'm in favor of anything that helps make us more native, but this change does have a slight usability implication.  Switching ui-r to beltzner for his feedback.
Usability? Funny...

All GTK engines and themes draw current tab in different way than others, so Firefox shouldn't differ from native apps...
