patch to add --enable-official-branding

better patch

bryner says "r=bryner" with the changes in this patch (test for
browser/app/macbuild in the official branding makefile rather than add a new
makefile for it and use += instead of := in client.mk to add the other-licenses
dir to the checkout rather than duplicate mozilla/browser)

bryner also said I should always pull this dir
there's a typo in mozilla/Makefile.in:
tire_99_dirs  += other-licenses/branding/firefox

should be tier_99_dirs.

So this stuff only works in srcdir builds, not objdir builds, since in objdir
builds it copies into the objdir when the makefiles in question copy use the
files from the srcdir.

It's also rather risky, since by overwriting other files in the source tree,
you risk those files being accidentally checked in.
(Maybe that's not really why it doesn't work in objdir builds, but tainting the
srcdir in srcdir builds is bad anyway.)

Are there any plans to use this libre artwork, to avoid any issues between the
unofficial builders and the Mozilla Foundation over its new stance on branding
trademarks?
bug 237725 has been filed on the creation of a staging area in dist for branded
resources. mscott will be working on this shortly. 

unofficial artwork has been checked into the MPL'ed sections of the tree. 
this should now work.
Whose unofficial artwork?
