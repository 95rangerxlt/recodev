To deal with the non-privilegedness of the hidden window on Win/Linux in bug 762569, we switched to using an xhtml iframe (with bug 769771 fixed). We might be able to do something like that and just call swapFrameLoaders on it directly (not via browser.swapDocShells).

We'd also need to make sure the browser is destroyed when it's no longer needed (e.g. when there are no more open browser windows).

I tried doing the same but "about:newtab" wouldn't load because of security reasons. chrome://browser/content/newtab/newTab.xul loads just fine.

That's unfortunately not implemented for iframes :(

We shouldn't do this because there wouldn't be any preloaded tab for newly opened tabs on Mac.

This will work around the issue reported in bug 786484. With paint flashing enabled you can see that the excessive invalidation is gone.

I tested this out on Mac and confirmed that this fixes the invalidation issues.

Discussed on IRC and Tim said that we can add a chrome page specifically for new tab preloading.
r+ with the special-purpose chrome page for tab preloading.
Thank you!
