The search-textbox constructor uses setTimeout to delay the call to the initialize method. According to the history books (and gavin), this is because, at least at some point, we were regressing on talos, and this fixed things (since initializing used to also kick off the search service).

Well, it doesn't kick off the search service anymore, and it's causing test failures for our patch for bug 865926. Dolske and Gavin have decreed that it's bogus, so I'll strip it out.

Patch v1 (r+'d by dolske)

r+'d by dolske over IRC.
Landed on inbound as https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/f0b62fbadce9
(Bug 330887 last fiddled with this, but the original addition of the setTimeout dates back to an early 2006 change (CVS v1.4) by Blake Ross without a bug.)
(You could also have just removed "initialize" entirely, putting it directly in the constructor.)

(I've filed a follow-up (bug 875297) to move the stuff from initialize into the constructor.)
