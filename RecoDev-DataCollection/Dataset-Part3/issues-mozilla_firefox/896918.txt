We can just link to SUMO until bug 492557 is done. It's wanted for bugs such as bug 513165, bug 513168, bug 519937.

LGTM! I didn't know we had 'pressing' dependencies on bug 492557, but this is a good intermediate step.

No ui-review? Was this discussed more widely than just in this bug?

In bug 513168, bug 519927 and of course bug 492557 that was going to add the same menu item just with a different command.

Looping in Verdi for some documentation love.
Maybe Jennifer has something to add here. I've had conversations with Verdi who has some excellent thoughts on how to make this change more impactful for the end user. Perhaps we should have a quick meeting to discuss.

This seems to have just landed without a ui-review.  For any user-facing interface-level change, that review needs to happen.  Verdi, Grimes, and others have been researching the help menu and have a proposal based on SUMO feedback for its ordering that I see no reason not to support, but it doesn't include Keyboard Shortcuts as a top-level menu item.  Unless there's some info behind this bug I'm not aware of, I think we should back this out and defer to Grimes and Verdi on ordering.
It's unclear to me why the current position in the Help menu would be problematic, let alone problematic enough to warrant a backout. Also, this couldn't be backed out without something replacing it, because other bugs depend on it.

I'd like to see the thoughts mentioned in comment 7 filed as new bugs, once they're settled. However, please note again that the current action of loading SUMO's keyboard shortcuts page was supposed to be replaced by bug 492557 eventually, where SUMO wouldn't really be involved. You might want to chime in there if this conflicts with your ideas.
This should just be part of the main 'Help' page... not a separate Menu item.

That doesn't sound like it would make this "more impactful" (comment 7) nor does it take bug 492557 into account.
If it's a real big deal, why not put more resources on bug 492557?
I agree, since this landed without UI review, UX / Verdi already have a clear forward plan for the help menu (which I've need infoed Verdi about)and Bug 492557 seems to be the long term solution for making keyboard shortcuts more visible, we should back this out and focus on that bug. This is over rotating on something that isn't time critical and we can take a release or two to make 492557 perfect.
Support and User Advocacy met with UX and came up with a plan for the Help menu that we'd like to implement (Bug 915908). Initially this started as a conversation around whether or not to have a help menu in Australis (and just link to SUMO) but, since we're going ahead with a help menu, it turned into rethinking what should be in the help menu. In that conversation we focused on actionable things with the highest impact. I don't think Keyboard Shortcuts fits in that case. 

Certainly there are some really helpful keyboard shortcuts, but most of them are not needed by most users. Take a look at what we have documented on SUMO https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly I don't believe the discoverability of the shortcut for selecting tab #8, for example, is of equal importance as things like resetting Firefox or learning about your browser's performance (FHR). Keyboard shortcuts can easily be found with a quick search http://mzl.la/187h8q2 (which is probably where the users most likely to use them, look for them). 

I think we should back this out as suggested in comment 8.

True. Keyboard shortcuts are an accessibility feature that doesn't affect most people. That doesn't mean the menu item should go away, though. Do you think it will misdirect people that don't need it?

No, they're currently exposed quite prominently right in the menus. That's changing. Please see the bugs that I mentioned multiple times now.
This landing without ui-review was not ideal.

It's not clear to me whether the best way forward is backing this (and the bugs it blocks) out, or maintaining the status quo until we have bug 492557. I don't quite understand the downsides to maintaining the status quo.

Boriss/Tyler, if you want to push for a backout here, can you propose that to firefox-dev with your reasoning?
