Looks like a nice cleanup! :-)

I'm probably not going to fully review/test this before January. Am I correct in assuming that you are only targeting 37?
I'd like to uplift to 36 at least, and 35 if time allows. Do we already use this code with rtl locales? It's kind of broken there, right? This patch should help with that.

The code looks good. I haven't fully understood (yet) the platform specific padding/margin changes.

On Mac retina, the panel appears a few pixels to the left of the textfield: http://i.imgur.com/cmbidiY.png
On the non-retina external screen, it looks good (when zooming it seems to be one pixel to the right; but that's not noticeable without zooming and I won't claim the alignment was perfect before either).

I don't see anything obviously causing this difference

I haven't been able to test on Windows yet, as the patch doesn't apply cleanly above my current checkout, and I need to update Visual Studio before I can build newer code.

What happens is that the search glass icon shrinks when moving the window to the retina screen.

This doesn't have anything to do with my patch, does it?

This doesn't happen without applying your patch.
Ok, it looks like the width being set on .searchbar-search-button for high-DPI is off because of the padding I added.

Now looks as good or better than before the patch on all the platforms I tested (OS X 10.10 both retina and non-retina, Windows 7, Ubuntu), thanks!

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 1088660
[User impact if declined]: some minor misalignment, likely worse glitches in right-to-left locales
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: no test coverage for this kind of stuff
[Risks and why]: somewhere between low and medium. not a very complicated patch, but not the simplest either. however, any fallout (not that I anticipate it) would likely be minor
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none

I think you meant to request beta approval for 36 rather than aurora.
