Seems that the "reset l10n on aurora" step didn't happen.

L10n data changes

# revert to previous Aurora locales - l10n drivers can file post-merge bugs to add new locales
hg revert -r FIREFOX_AURORA_28_END browser/locales/*-locales
hg revert -r FIREFOX_AURORA_28_END mobile/android/locales/*-locales

[edit] Verify & Commit l10n changes

$ hg commit -m "Merging in l10n changes NO BUG CLOSED TREE IGNORE BROKEN CHANGESETS ba=release"
$ hg out


The FIREFOX_AURORA_28_END tag doesn't exist on aurora. Not sure if http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/74cdc97dbc93 should be that, instead of 27_END?

I did run it (though with FIREFOX_AURORA_27_END -- those notes update based on templates that are bumped post-merge) and http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/992090ae0e29  is what resulted from running that.
If there's still missing changes, let's get them landed today so that the Aurora nightly builds will reflect them.
As mentioned in IRC by Axel, I reverted the locales using:

hg diff -r 7edc4f8cb055 browser/locales/*-locales mobile/android/locales/*-locales

Which Axel stated in IRC gave the desired reversal.  Pushed:

 https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/560edec8482e

Please confirm this is now the correct set of locales.

Reverting to Aurora 28 locales*

This is the patch applied.
Yep, thanks, that's the right fix.
