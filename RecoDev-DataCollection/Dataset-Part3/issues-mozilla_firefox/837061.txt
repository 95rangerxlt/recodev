gBrowser.moveTabTo trigger tab constructor which reset all the tab filed

After moving a tab tab._fullyOpen set back to false

to test it, open few tabs then from Scratchpad window run:
var tab = gBrowser.tabs[gBrowser.tabs.length-1];
Services.console.logStringMessage("before tab moved tab._fullyOpen " + tab._fullyOpen);
gBrowser.moveTabTo(tab, 0);
Services.console.logStringMessage("after tab moved tab._fullyOpen " + tab._fullyOpen);


Result in the console:
before tab moved tab._fullyOpen true
after tab moved tab._fullyOpen false

I thought I had fixed this, but I guess my fix was part of a larger patch that was landed and then backed out a long time ago.

maybe it is best to initiate all the tab property in addTab

remember that tab.closing is also important property, is it possible that the binding destruction is also the cause of bug 608589 ?
maybe some other action trigger tab binding to reconstruct ?

I think unlikely, but I don't know, but since XBL is neither truly spec'd nor clearly not well understood by even the few people who use it (us), it's probably best simply to stop using it when sensible and possible.
