Remote debugging protocol: show sequence numbers with packets.

It makes packet logs a lot easier to read if you associate numbers with packets, and print when the packet is sent and received. For the simple tests, it's not interesting, but for the more involved tests, it's extremely helpful to be able to see when something was sent, and when it was actually received.

Revised. Works better when the count is shared between the two paired LocalDebuggerTransport instances...

Wouldn't it make sense to move this inside the if(wantLogging) branch?

I thought about that. But if something turns wantLogging on or off in the midst of a session, we could have packets sent before the switch being delivered after the switch, and it seemed like it would be more comprehensible to have them all numbered.
