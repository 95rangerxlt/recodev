After I download an extension, I cannot find it in the extension tab or anywhere in Firefox 4.0 beta 6 where if I use Firefox 3.6.10, it shows up and works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download an extension
2. Restart Firefox
3. Go to the extension tab
Actual Results:  
The extension just installed will not appear in the extension section and does not show up anywhere else in Firefox.

Expected Results:  
It should appear in the extension section and work properly.
