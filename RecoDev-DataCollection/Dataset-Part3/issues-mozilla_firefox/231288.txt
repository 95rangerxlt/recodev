This problem only shows up on Bugzilla because I can't find another page that
actually has this setup.  The mouse wheel fails to scroll either up or down in
an embedded, scrollable field when the top button of the embedded scrollbar is
off the top of the screen, even if the cursor is inside the field.  It does not
help to click on the field, as it does when, for example, I am typing in a text
field and want to scroll the main window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Bugzilla and start a new bug.
2. Do a search guaranteed to produce a long list of bugs.
3. Scroll the search window using the mouse wheel with the top scroll button in
view; now scroll the main window until the top of the search window is off the
screen, and scroll the search window again.

Actual Results:  
The second time, the search window will not scroll.

Expected Results:  
The search window should scroll regardless of the position of the top scroll
button.  Note that this does not happen if the bottom scroll button is off screen.

It works in Moz 1.7RC3, doesn't work (or rather, I can confirm) with Mozilla/5.0

Fixed in firefox-0.9
