Before attacking bug 816607 we should add some telemetry that makes it possible to actually measure improvements. We should wrap this restoreWindow() call here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/SessionStore.jsm#785

If we just record timestamps before and after the call we can easily see how much time it takes to create the tabs one after one, pinning and hidding them, reflowing, etc. On my machine this takes >1600ms for a 150+ tabs session.

Steven, as you'll be working on bug 816607, want to take this one as well?

Patch - Add telemetry to restoreWindow

Instead of wrapping the call to |restoreWindow|, we time inside it and do not include the JSON parsing, call to onLoad, or the RestoreCompletedNotifications. This gives a better idea of how much time is being spent actually preforming the restore.
