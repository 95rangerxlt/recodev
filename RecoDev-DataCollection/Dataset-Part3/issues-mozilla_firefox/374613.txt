In Fx2, microsummarized bookmarks have a context menu option for reloading the title, labeled "Reload Live Title". This needs to be added to the Places context menu for those bookmarks.

This should be implemented as a separate command (and menu-item).

the menu item in the organizer should only be enabled for microsummarized bookmarks, it's currently enabled for everything.

almost there :)

Weird

So I fixed the problem with the edit menu under the Bookmark manager you mentioned. But now something funky happens. When you first right click on a bookmark with microsummary in the toolbar, "Reload Live Title" will be grayed out. But if you right click on it for the 2nd time, "Reload Live Title" will not be grayed out. So I tried dumping out the value for "this" (mentioned in the first couple +'s in this diff file), first time it prints out "null" and the second time its a valid object.
A little confused on this one..

That's bug 381477 which is basically a cocoa widget issue.

first check whether selectedNode is a bookmark node (PlacesUtils.nodeIsBookmark).

Regarding the access key, "Reload Live Bookmark" and "Reload Live Bookmark" had the same access key in Fx2. So I set the access key in this patch as the access key for "Reload live Bookmark".

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
