Why are you making restoration of this data depend on aOverwriteTabs being true? IIRC, if an app update was downloaded pre-crash and then applied when restarting post-crash, aOverwriteTabs would be false, and we'd want to restore this data in that scenario.

fix (restores the list at startup and when overwriting a window)

Indeed, at startup we've got root._firstTabs but not aOverwriteTabs set for the very first window. Thanks for catching that.
Drivers: This simple patch ensures that the list of recently closed tabs isn't lost after a crash and also allows extensions to restore that list when restoring an arbitrary session (which so far isn't possible). The patch's risk is low.

a=schrep for drivers - approving all [181approval pending] bugs now that tree is open.
On branch, the patch for this bug caused the regression noted in bug 343871 comment #15.

initialize windows before restoring them

This patch fixes a race condition wherein we assumed that the domwindowopened notification would always be received before a window's contents would be restored. The fix initializes windows prior to attempting restoration, for windows have not yet been initialized.

Drivers: This fixes a serious problem in which secondary restored windows have tabs but no content.

initialize windows before restoring them

Dietrich: What happens when restoreWindow is called before the expected onLoad call?

AFAICT: onLoad is called now and it will be called later again - thus overwriting the window's __SSi which will effectively clear the list of recently closed tabs and all other data directly added to _windows[aWindow.__SSi]. You'll thus have to add the same check to onLoad as well.
I guess that this patch hasn't landed yet, because I still see the problem with todays nightly ( Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060828 BonEcho/2.0b2 ). 

P.S. This bug is really annoying and discouraging for testers, because we lose the contents of other windows if we had >1 open before the update.

add window initialization check to onLoad

This addresses Simon's comment by not initializing windows that have already been initialized.

add window initialization check to onLoad

r+a=me for this, let's get these landed
Will this also restore the list of Closed Tabs if the user has selected  the option of restoring his session (tabs and windows) when starting Firefox. Its the expected behavior.
If not, should I file a separate bug for the same?
(In reply to comment #15)
This patch indeed also restores the list when resuming a session regularly (without a crash).
