Gabriela, do you about any crash IDs from about:crashes?
Gabriela, is the WordWeb add-on you are using? I can't find "WordWeb one-click lookup" on addons.mozilla.org. The WordWeb looks like it might be a binary add-on or a plugin.

Chris, I found "WordWeb one-click lookup" in http://arewee10syet.com/. Clicking on that site's link I got to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/one-click-popup-dictionary/, which was the addon that I installed.  

With e10s disabled, it never found any definition.
With e10s enabled the addon crashed all the tabs. No recover all tabs was possible.
I have 6 crash IDs from about:crashes. I can paste them here if necessary.

Trying again with today's update, with e10s disabled, it never finds any definition. With e10s enabled it doesn't crash but it does not work either: clicking the addon button and/or pressing Shift+D the help window shows up but no definitions.

Thanks, Gabriela. I updated the bug summary and arewee10syet.com to use the "One Click Popup Dictionary" addon name.

If the latest Nightly update does not crash, then you don't need to paste the crash IDs here. We can assume that particular crash is fixed unless you see it again. :)

Does the addon find definitions in Firefox 36, the current release version of Firefox? I removed "e10s" from the bug summary because you said the addon doesn't find any word definitions regardless of whether e10s is enabled or disabled.
Rejah, Sreenath, and Prathapan, are you the developers of the "One Click Popup Dictionary" add-on?

The add-on seems to be broken in the Firefox Nightly channel and might be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Jim Mathies on this bug. MDN also has a good introduction:

No, it doesn't work in Firefox 36 either: "No definition found". I had to install an earlier version of the addon though, v 1.1 instead of the latest 1.2 because this one failed to install: "the addon couldn't be installed because it doesn't match the addon that Firefox expected". I had the same issue in Nightly.
I am working on it, will update soon

Hey Rejah,

No need to mark this tracking-e10s unless you find a bug in the browser that is causing you trouble. We aren't tracking add-on specific issues using bugzilla's e10s flags.

Dropping this into the addons bug and marking +. Per the comments, in e10s, this addon currently crashes all tabs.
New version Updated with e10s support.
Gaby, does this addon work for you with updated version?
Tracy, yes! It works fine in Nightly now either with e10s enabled or disabled.
