patch

I noticed that the same problem is also visible for tree/list headers, so I included that as well in this patch.

This patch copies the colors used for toolbar buttons: the color ButtonText for active comboboxes and tree/list headers, and the color -moz-button-hovertext for hover over the same widgets.

Note that this doesn't fix this issue for buttons and comboboxes in HTML. I'll file another bug for that (since that requires CSS that effects all platforms).
Adjusting the summary so it better describes the issue.

CVS reports "malformed patch at line 136", but manually applying the patch works fine and fixes the cases I tested. r=myk

This is the same patch, but against the latest revisions of the files involved. I hope that will prevent the CVS error.
