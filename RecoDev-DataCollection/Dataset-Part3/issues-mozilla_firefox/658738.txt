I was looking at http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/Firefox/1305941364.1305945463.28696.gz for unrelated reasons, and noticed that at the end of the test there are about 500 DOMWINDOW objects around, and only a few docshells.  So I grabbed the log and looked at the urls of the windows being destroyed _after_ the hidden window.  The top offenders of the 500 or so windows left at that point are:

  339 about:blank
   96 chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
   84 about:addons

I tried a quick test of just opening and closing windows locally and the browser.xul windows go away.

Oh, during that whole test run about 186 chrome://browser/content/browser.xul windows go away.

And windows are going away through the run as we go, so it's not like _all_ windows leak.  Just a bunch of them.  Looking at the log, we seem to have both inner and outer browser.xul windows around at the end there.

The big question: is this just test code holding on to windows?  Or is this test code calling code that would normally run in our UI and holds on to windows?

Again, all the windows are _closed_ (no docshell) but the inner and outer window objects are hanging around at shutdown.

It'd be nice if someone familiar with the browser tests took a look at which tests are opening the windows that leak or something.  Do we have any other ways of finding their allocation points?

Log as a zip file to make sure it doesn't go away

Though I bet any Moth log will show this.
Oh, and Gavin, Dao, please cc whoever might be the right people for this?
This is totally unacceptable and we will fix. Assigning to me.
So to be clear, since I realized some stuff from comment 0 was a bit fuzzy:

1)  I can't reproduce the problem locally running a debug build for about a minute opening and closing random windows and tabs.  Things go away as they should when I do that.

2)  About half the browser.xul windows the Moth tests opened were around at browserchrome test shutdown.  The other half went away before that.
(In reply to comment #0)
> The big question: is this just test code holding on to windows?

That's very likely the case. Browser chrome tests all run in the same window. A good portion of them will open new windows, do stuff and close them again.
> A good portion of them will open new windows, do stuff and close them again.

Yes, but do they then hold references to those windows in perpetuity?
They might add a load event listener and not remove it.
Sure.  The question is whether that's happening or whether we have something going on that could bite in normal browsing too.
It's certainly happening.
OK, can we stop it happening and see whether the behavior goes away?
I'm perhaps jumping ahead, but is it possible to add a test (or modify the test harness?) so that when this is fixed is stays fixed? EG, something makes noise and turns orange if a test (or real bug!) causes a window to leak to shutdown.
The hidden window is always alive until shutdown.  So we'd need to do something smart....
We can assert that, after a GC, there are no longer any windows that don't have a Components object (since we remove the Components object when the window is closed).  That's the heuristic that Leak Monitor uses.  Unfortunately, we haven't gotten back to cleanly meeting that even for simple testcases since Firefox 2.
Out of 748 tests, I found 53 tests where addEventListener occurs more often than removeEventListener. This is a naive way to count and very likely inaccurate, but the scale seems reasonable.

I should add that I don't actually expect the const -> var changes in this patch (so that 'delete' can kill the references) to contribute to the lower DOM window count. It's just something I wanted to rule out as a factor.

Can you put the destroy()/nulling of .scope in nextTest (after the duration stuff), rather than in the waitForWindowsState callback?
Hmm.  Is it expected that the test scopes will hang around like that?

> Hmm.  Is it expected that the test scopes will hang around like that?

The test array is kept around for the duration of the run, so yes.
Can we pop things out of that array instead?  Seems cleaner....
The test objects keep track of the test results, so no. This patch clears the stuff that needs to be/can be cleared, I'm not sure I understand why you think it's "unclean".
Just generally, clearing properties seems like something that someone could forget to do in other circumstances.  In this case it sounds like that's a non-issue.

Sounds like these mobile tests are just broken, as the scopes get cleared after the tests have declared that they're finished.

I filed bug 669617 for an apparently-new intermittent mochitest-chrome crash that occurred on the push following this one; I don't know if it's related in any way but the timing looks a bit suspicious.
The four places.xul instances originate from these tests:

browser_410196_paste_into_tags.js
browser_416459_cut.js
browser_library_batch_delete.js
browser_library_left_pane_commands.js
The number of docshells is now 55 (previously 7) starting with <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a447e63943e1>.
... which was backed out (along with the patch it was a bustage fix for).

Has anyone ideas on how to achieve this?

The list is slowly growing every few days, which makes this bug an uphill battle that I'd have to keep fighting for multiple months.
In Bug 633670 I'm going to implement some code to test to see that a window has been GCd.  Plan is to work on this at the beginning of next week.
We can make new leaks turn b-c orange even before all the dependencies are fixed. For example, we could make it turn orange if the number of leaked windows changes.

[Checked in: Comment 62]

Cuts away more about:blank and pluginInstallerWizard.xul (down to 1). Calling garbageCollect only once also helps, but not quite as much.
The most effective way to clear memory is to fire several memory-pressure notifications separated by trips to the event loop, perhaps with some schedulePreciseGC tossed in.  See my comments in bug 654041.

Ideally, the mochitest shutdown sequence would make it possible to see how many windows remain after each memory-pressure notification.  This way, we can file bugs when windows take multiple GCs/CCs to clean up (which often means we're one additional edge away from a leak).

more GC/CC
[Checked in: Comment 62]

I'm kind of lost as to what the goal is here. Have we determined that the window leaks that this patch "fixes" are not real issues that come up outside of the test harness (e.g. a problem with our GC/CC heuristics)? Test-harness only changes that hide them are only useful if we can say with confidence that they're not "real" issues, and I'm not sure that we can do that.
The goal is to get the relatively minor "requires multiple GCs/CCs to clean up" bugs out of our way so we can start ratcheting down on *something*.

I'd like these bugs to be noted in the log.  But they probably shouldn't turn the tree orange, because they would be intermittently caught (due to heuristics such as GC timing, CC timing, and conservative scanning).

Also, winutils.garbageCollect triggers a CC, while schedulePreciseGC does not. So we clearly need at least one of the added calls.

OK, that makes sense. The comment before this code should probably be adjusted - this doesn't really result in a "more accurate" window count, just a different one (omitting windows that would have eventually been picked up anyways - i.e. we're hiding less serious issues so that we can focus on more serious ones).

Note that some windows aren't leaked, they just exist as part of the browser window that all tests run in. This is probably the case for browser_bug597218.js, for instance, which I guess causes panorama to load its iframe.

Dão, what's the status of this bug?  Looks like there are a few dependent bugs still, but not that many.  Are you working on them?  Maybe this should be downgraded to a MemShrink:P2?
Well, how important is it for the tree to turn orange when we introduce a big new leak bug?  Getting the leaks to zero is the most straightforward way to do that, but not the only way.
I don't really care if this is a P1 -- I think bug 633670 and/or bug 683953 should be, though, so we can stop monitoring this manually.

The biggest remaining offender is bug 675412, by the way, which seems to be stalled.

Can we add a leaked-window threshold check (eg, < 130) to prevent further slips like this? Experience from previous "drive X to 0" efforts seems to be that it (1) takes a long time to actually reach 0 and (2) in the meantime more regressions will slip in.

I just uploaded a new patch to bug 683953 which implements a threshold and makes the tree go orange if we leak more than that. Unfortunately, the counts vary heavily on different platforms, see bug 683953 comment #13 for some stats.

Would it be possible (maybe via adding something to nsIWindowUtils) to track the number of DOM windows that exist, so that the test harness can directly implicate each test as it runs?

Ed, I'm curious what spurred this large list of new bugs.  Are these new leaks, or have they just not been filed before?
They are the tests that are regularly causing us to go over the threshold and thus cause bug 754804. They just haven't been filed until now. Dão has been driving the shutdown leaks threshold related bugs for a while now, thought he could do with a second pair of hands :-)
I think this has outlived its usefulness as a tracking bug let alone as a bug where actual work happens. New leaky tests can be (and have been) dealt with in other bugs that don't need to block this one.
