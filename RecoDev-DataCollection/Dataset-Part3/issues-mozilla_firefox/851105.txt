I could not reproduce this issue on Firefox 7.0.1. I'm still investigating this issue and I'll post the results as soon as possible.
This sounds like a change the authors need to make in the extension.
I didn't get any data leak on Firefox 14.0.1 related with Yandex. So I tried to find a regression range between Nightly 14 and Nightly 15, but I get all sort of different data and URL's from Private Browsing (some related with Yandex), making the finding of a regression range very difficult and unreliable.

Comment 3 points to this being a change we made (likely the backend changes in FF19?). Even if it's not a regression, we need to help identify what the likely cause is before reaching out about this issue.
Given that it's cache-related, this is almost certainly a result of the changes of bug 722845 in FF 18. They're probably creating a channel (or XMLHttpRequest) that's not associated with a given window, therefore it defaults to public.
Fixed in YandexBar 7.5 (release in april).

Thank you.
