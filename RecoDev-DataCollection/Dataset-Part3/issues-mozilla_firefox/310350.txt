Aaron noticed that the context menu stopped working on the latest FF build which
is 09/26 build.

steps to recreate:

1. Bring up Window Eyes and FF nightly build of 09/24 and using goggle.com
2. press * on the num key pad and you will noticed that nothing is spoken no
firing of events.

This working fine with 09/213 build.

Update, FYI this also broken with JAWS so we know it's a FF bug
We're no longer seeing popupshown events internally.
This was caused by bug 307172.

I was wrong. It was caused by adding
AreAncestorViewsVisible() as a requirement for creating accessibles.

1) Mark chrome docs as loaded so that mutation handling works, 2)  Keep menu event impls separate for XUL vs. DHTML menus, 3) Use FireDelayedToolkitEvent for popupshown so ancestor views are visible
This also fixes the asymmetrical menu events that were occuring as a user typed
in an autocomplete such as the location bar. They're symmetrical now with this
patch, so the screen readers won't have to work around that issue anymore.
