All,

Please keep adding status of your builds in this bug.  We're currently
evaluating the feedback we're getting on the en-US builds and seeing if they
will affect the localizations.  That's why you're not seeing localized builds on
the web site just yet.

We will know more tomorrow 7/14 at 12:00PM PST and will keep you posted.

Rafael, I must say that this new policy is very destructive for our local
markets. We're more than 2 days after 1.0.5 release and l10n builds still are
not released. We gather very bad press, we're blamed by users, we have no reason
to explain this, we don't know how to explain this to journalists who're asking
about this issue.
We moved to centralized localization system to make l10n release easier and more
stable. Such changes makes it absolutely pointless because we would be able to
provide localized build by ourselves MUCH faster. Tens of milions of users are
still using 1.0.4 while critical, security bugs are already published after
en-US 1.0.5 release. I want to say that this seems to be absolutely ignored by
Mozilla Foundation and by such delays you waste huge amount of work l10n teams
are doing to promote our brands on local markets.
I would like to sign myself bellow Gandalf's post. (sorry for "me too" post)

Now it's 7/15 and we still know nothing, except from "something is wrong"...

 
Unconfirmed: In Firefox 1.0.5 was accidentaly changed some stable API, what
caused problems with third-party extensions. Guys in MoFo are searching solution
(and don't communicate).
How can we explain to the community and press what's going on?
1.0.6 is coming soon?
Please, stop being so vague! Just tell us what the problem is!

Is the API change (the one Asa wrote about in npm.l10n as a problem with
_Thunderbird_ 1.0.5) the problem here? If not, what is? And when can we expect
the localized builds to finally show up? Or will we have a 1.0.6 release of Firefox?

We are getting lots of e-mails from Firefox users in Poland asking us about why
isn't Firefox 1.0.5 available in Polish (and we, the l10n team, are being blamed
for the delay). The journalists are also asking us the same questions (and how
can we answer those questions? "Mozilla.org has some problems, we will release
the localized version >>when it's ready<<"?!).

A few days more and it's gonna be a big PR disaster for Firefox outside the USA.

If I read Asa's post and comment in his own blog right, there _is_ going to be a
Firefox 1.0.6 very soon and I assume that this is also the reason for the delay
here, or better: The reason for the localized 1.0.5 builds not being released at
all.

Correct me if I am wrong.

You are correct.  We received feedback on 1.0.5 from distributors and extension
developers on API changes that affected them (not a security issue), so we're
looking at a 1.0.6 to fix it.  We will have builds of a 1.0.6 to test tomorrow
morning and will hope to complete certification by Monday.  We will provide
status in this bug.  

If you have issues with the press or users regarding delays please email
press@mozilla.org or me and we can help.  
> If you have issues with the press or users regarding delays please email

Yes. Please, can we ask for press release? Even small one? The one we could
point out to anyone asking about l10n 1.0.5? - even a note on Mozilla Quality
weblog would be enough.
Something we could point out to anyone asking for explanation.

And I hope that with 1.0.6 you will not release 1.0.6 en-US first, wait for
feedback and THEN l10n builds. We strongly prefer to have the very same build as
en-US have.
Are these changes in API affect liveconnect? Some applets that comunicate via
liveconnect whith javascript code seems to be broken... They still work on IE.
We're planning to count the Firefox 1.0.5 signoffs for Firefox 1.0.6.

The 1.0.6 candidate l10n builds (from 2005-07-16 or 2005-07-17) should appear in
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates/
shortly.  Testing these builds is a good idea even if you've already signed off
on the 1.0.5 builds, and if you haven't yet signed off on the builds, it's
probably better to sign off based on the 1.0.6 candidates.
We do need the repackaged ja-JP installers, though.
Er, actually, it looks like
http://ftp-developer.mozilla-japan.org/pub/mozilla-japan/firefox/development/1.0.6/
has one.
Can anyone point me to a mention from Asai that the build in the 1.0.6 directory
on ftp-developer.mozilla-japan.org is based on the Saturday morning Fx build?

I'm getting my wires crossed.  It looks to be based on the ja-JP build in the
aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates directory (which if true is correct).  I would just
like to hear from Asai that
http://ftp-developer.mozilla-japan.org/pub/mozilla-japan/firefox/development/1.0.6/firefox-1.0.6-2005071718.ja-JP.win32.installer.exe
is the build they want us to include in the relese.
Please, may you update Catalan (ca-AD) in
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all.html?
Is it necessary to sign again in another bug?
We had just finished our QA and no regression found.
Thanks picking up my repackaged build. (the build is correct one)

The build is based on build in aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates dir.
# the dir pointed by David Baron in comment #48 
As the file name indicates, 2005-07-17 builds.

Thanks finding the build, David and thanks shipping, Chase.

i updated the builds to 1.0.6. the updated files can be found here:

can you please upload them?

(1.0.6 builds)
Made ca-AD, sq-AL, mk-MK, sv-SE, and he-IL live.
Regarding the pa-IN build (there's probably a better place to discuss this...),
I'm not sure if it's had the necessary tests that we do before shipping a
localization for the first time at
http://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaQualityAssurance:l10n_checklist .  Furthermore,
in some brief testing that I did, it seems the default bookmarks file doesn't
work correctly (maybe some sort of parsing problem?)

Regarding ast-ES -- nobody's signed off on that one.

ast-ES is now live.
Mass reassign of open bugs for chase@mozilla.org to build@mozilla-org.bugs.
Anything preventing us from closing this bug?
