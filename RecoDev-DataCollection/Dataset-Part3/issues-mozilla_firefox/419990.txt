Because urlbar.showhistory is set to false (when chromehidden) in delayedStartup and not in BrowserStartup, the window sizing code can take the wrong chrome height (with a visible dropdown) into account.

On IRC I was told that the code could as well go in BrowserStartup, so here is a patch.

This bug makes tests/docshell/test/test_bug344861.html FAIL when the dropmarker has too big dimensions (which is triggered by bug 415163, by 1 pixel)

I tested locally for txul (30 windows for phase1, 20 for phase 2, and 10 for phase 3) once with the patch and once without, and here is what I got:

without:
avgOpenTime:499
minOpenTime:433
maxOpenTime:786
medOpenTime:473

with:
avgOpenTime:503
minOpenTime:436
maxOpenTime:875
medOpenTime:468

So Txul isn't really affected. Note that the high values (for each test they happen roughly every 10 windows) aren't that much present when doing only 10 of phase 1 (the default of the test), I suspect that there is memory cleaning happening every so often or something like that.

This bug blocks two approved for 1.9 bugs.

Drivers: This is blocking at least 6 other Linux-specific bugs (see dependency tree), and while it's not a blocker, we at Team Penguin would really appreciate getting this fix in so we can land the patches from the other bugs.
