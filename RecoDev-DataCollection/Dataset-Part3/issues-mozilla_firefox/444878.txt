Bug 418879 checked in.
The scrollbar did not appear in Page Info. 
This is smart. 
However, Long feed URIs cannot be completely seen without expanding the dialog. 
We need tooltip for Feed URIs. 

Reproducible: Always

Seems like we're hiding information that was available before, so this is more than an enhancement request, right?

scrollable it self (example)

Why are Feed URIs displayed here?
Because Feed URIs wants to be confirmed to the user. 

Before Bug 418879, 
- displayed scrollbar
- It doesn't look cool
- The confirmation of Feed URIs is easy

After Bug 418879, 
- not displayed scrollbar
- It looks cool
- The confirmation of Feed URIs is not easy
- It is necessary to change the width of Page Info in every case

Feed URIs can be easily confirmed:
- displayed scrollbar
- breaked (wraped) Feed URIs
- Feed URIs scrollable it self
- show link tooltip
- not displayed Feed URIs on richlistitem (tooltip only?)

etc.
Are you suggesting to revert bug 383880?

No, comment #3 is brainstorming.
I read comment #2 and thought. 

Now, Bug 418879 looks good. However, it is not functional. 

If by making feed URIs scrollable you mean using a text box control like we do for the Page URI in the Page Info General section, that can't be done if the URIs are supposed to be clickable at well, because users who try to select all (or part) of the URI using the mouse will end up with an opened feed once the mouse button is released (and a click event happens).  I think tooltips should be fine here, they are used to show more info about the hovered item that there is place to show in the UI itself (or where such extra info are not appropriate for displaying in the UI alongside other elements.
I also think that tooltip is good if it is not semantically wrong.

Obvious solution.

Looks good using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008071504 Minefield/3.1a1pre. Running on Mac when I hover over the toolip using the "Bugs Filed Today" RSS feed, there is a bit of an odd line break that doesn't match what I see on Vista. It is a bit difficult to grab a screenshot but I will try.
