The short of it is that bug 160454 made some major changes to the "save as" code
in contentAreaUtils.js to stop using HEAD (and in the process fix the dozens of
bugs blocked by bug 160454).  The changes are not quite done yet; bug 263697 and
bug 174167 remain.  But it would be good to port the changes (including the
fixes to those bugs) to Firefox at some point.  Unfortunately, that file is
somewhat heavily modified, so it'll take some merging to get things working.

This is very much trunk material, so I'm sure it's a low priority right now, but
I do think this would be a good thing to get done once Firefox comes back to trunk.

this.... ;)

I think it's pretty important that we have consistent website interaction when
saving files in the Suite and Firefox.  Differences like this are just going to
create headaches.

Phil: Any chance you might be willing to prepare a similar patch for Firefox?

Probably no time for weeks, sorry, but agree it'd be good to update FF. Never
having looked at the FF code, can you tell me - does it work on the principle of
the old trunk code (prior to the bug 160454 patch), but it's a different source
file (and written slightly differently)?
Yes, on all counts.  It's code that started out as a copy/paste of the SeaMonkey
code and then diverged somewhat.

Guess this falls under being my baby, should get this in a week or so.
fwiw, if you want extra review I can probably help out with that much....
fixed in bug 294759.
