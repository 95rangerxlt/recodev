I use jquery 1.4.2.
When i use the .get()-function to get data by XMLHttpRequest,
the call is ok (200), but response is empty.

The problem only occures with Firefox 3.6.6 at the moment. I also tested it with IE7 and Opera 10 and it works. But with Firefox - no luck...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit the URL (script starts onload)

I can confirm this, but in IE8 I had to change security settings to get it working. You are requesting information from another domain, which might give problems. Does this also happen when you try the trick with a site from the domain you are using for hosting the testscript?
