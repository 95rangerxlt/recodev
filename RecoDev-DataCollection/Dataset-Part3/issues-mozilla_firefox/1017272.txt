Drag a tab into the bookmarks bar to bookmark a page is broken in current Nightly (2014-05-28). It works as expected with Nightly of the day before (2014-05-27). Tested with a new profile on OS X 10.9.3.

The browser console says: uncaught exception: bogus data was passed as a tab
This bug might be fixed by tab-dragging bug 1016960.
Yes, it's fixed by bug 1016960, thanks.
