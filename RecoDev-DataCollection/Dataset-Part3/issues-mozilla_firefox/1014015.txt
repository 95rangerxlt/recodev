If we connect more than once to a device, we can see in logcat the following exception.
This exception doesn't break anything but pollute the logs and highlights that we do not clean things up correctly on disconnect:

E/GeckoConsole(28159): [JavaScript Error: "this.conn is null" {file: "resource:/
/gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://gre/modules/devtools/serve
r/main.js -> resource://gre/modules/devtools/server/actors/webapps.js" line: 977
}]
