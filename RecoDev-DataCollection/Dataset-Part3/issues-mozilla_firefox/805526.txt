Is there anything we can do on the b2g side to help there?

Nothing in particular. Dave is working on it. And as soon as I'm back online, I'll also be working on this. If you have any question, ask :jwalker.
Here's a quick status update:

I'm basing my work on the prototype at https://github.com/campd/mozilla-central/tree/async-inspector .  I took some time to make the actor work quite a bit better (particularly wrt memory management), but the frontend work should progress from prototype to patches more quickly.

Most of the actor work needed is in patches on dependent bugs.
Patch queue at http://hg.mozilla.org/users/dcamp_campd.org/patches-remote-inspector/
Let's do any further work in individual bugs.
