This could affect icon display for devtools extensions that register a command button (the buttons on the right, like responsive design mode and split console toggle).  The most likely way this would be done is if they registered a new gcli command and also specify a `buttonId` field, then set the image in CSS.  I don't know how common this really is, just making sure it's tagged.
