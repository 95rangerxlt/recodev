Seems like this might be worth noting once it ships.
Note that visibility of this tool depends on bug 1123815. This can't be relnoted until then. It also may not make sense to relnote this separately from the new performance tool.
Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]:  Nifty new view for performance tool. I think it's worth a new note.
[Suggested wording]: Add flamechart view to Details view in new performance tool
[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]: 

Jordan, is there anything up that we could link to that explains this tool or shows how it works?
Setting firefox-relnote flag to 40+ as Liz just added this to the release notes on nucleus.
Will is working on some docs for the new tool for the June 2nd release, but don't think the flame graph stuff is done yet: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance__

(And I think this will replace the current performance page for tools)

Pinging Will
jsantell, yes, I am aiming for the June 2nd date, but should have some stuff for you to look at by the end of next week.
I could swear this just said Firefox 40. But looks like it went out in 37. I'm removing the release note!
It technically landed in 37, but always behind a pref or build flag; 40.1 dev ed will be the first real "public" release
