I have five tab groups. Four of them have one or two tabs and one has 9. There is also a pinned tab (GMail). Every time I start the browser the tabs from the 9-tabs group wonder in some, seemingly randomly selected, other group.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sort your tabs nicely
2. Close the browser
3. Run the browser
Actual Results:  
Tabs shuffled around

Expected Results:  
I would expect the tab groups to keep their tabs after restart

Hey Alex, I'm pretty sure that this is a dupe of bug 628188. This problem should be gone if you manage to find the add-on(s) causing this problem and disable them.
Thanks Tim! I'll try as soon as I manage to trigger the problem.
I cannot reproduce the problem at all with 4.0.1.
I have to say, even with the previous version sometimes it'd go for days without breaking tab/group layout.
Yeah, the patch from bug 635975 landed in 4.0.1.
