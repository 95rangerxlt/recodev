Not exactly a top tier add-on, but noticed that this add-on stopped working with e10s (I'm responsible for all the amateur JS code in it).

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bbcodextra/

Add-on can be used to select text and add markup code, or paste text from the clipboard and apply markup. Both cases are broken, no error is reported in console.

Curious enough, the add-on still works in the search field on about:newtab, and obviously works in a non-e10s window.

I assume there's something in this part of the code not appreciated by e10s
https://github.com/flodolo/bbcodextra/blob/master/extension/content/bbcodextra.js#L437-L507

Which should be mostly adaption of code available here

Allison: can you review Francesco's code link for e10s problems?

Francesco: If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
By default, addon code runs in the parent. You can no longer touch 'document' directly (which this section does twice),or anything of type nsIDOMWindow.

You'll need to write a frame script that runs in the content process and use the message manager to pass info back to your main code in the parent.


https://timtaubert.de/blog/2011/08/firefox-electrolysis-101/ might also be worth a read for you, as well as the link above.
Thanks, I'll study and use #e10s for questions. 
Leaving the bug open as a reminder that my code is broken.
This was fixed in v0.5.1 (already approved on AMO).
