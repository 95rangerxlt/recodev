Currently the Web Console client can only connect to the shell.xul tab target of Firefox OS 1.0 (b2g18 branch). We should add support for connecting to the global console actor of Firefox OS 1.0, such that the console client can receive all of the messages for the whole process.

This bug is related to: bug 818385 and bug 798764.

This is the patch from bug 798764 rebased for mozilla-b2g18. Latest nightly Web Console client can connect to both the global and tab console actors running in b2g18. Things seem to be working fine - no additional patches needed.

Please let me know if any changes are needed.

I'm not sure what you're trying to do here, and in any case past should review that. Is that to get access to the web console in the parent process? Did you test on device?

My bad. Panos already reviewed the patch, since this is only a rebase I didn't ask him again for a review (should I?). I asked you for review - I wasn't sure if a b2g peer should look at it before, or not.

Shall I go ahead and ask for approval-mozilla-b2g18?


> Is that to get access to the web console in the parent process?

Yes, this patch fixes a bug in the WebConsoleActor such that the Web Console client can connect to the remote process and listen to all of the browser/device activity (console API calls, network requests, script errors, etc). This is what we call the "global console".


> Did you test on device?

I do not have a Firefox OS device. I tested with B2G Desktop builds. I expect this works with devices too. Can someone test it for us? Maybe Panos?

Thanks!
Fabrice, this is a fix we need in the Firefox OS Simulator (and B2G desktop, if that is a product we care about) in order to provide a sane remote debugging experience for developers. As you can see, this patch only touches devtools code, which I should note is disabled on devices.

Without this patch, users in the v1 branch need to connect to "shell.xul" for JS debugging and to "Main Process" for a REPL. Unfortunately we can't fix the debugger for "Main Process" in v1, so fully supporting the "shell.xul" target is our only option. This bug may be redundant, since the patch is a rebase of the patch in bug 798764, as mentioned in comment 1, but in any case, is this something we could get in v1, so that the simulator and b2g desktop can use?
Oh, that's good for me then, go ahead!
Thank you Fabrice!
