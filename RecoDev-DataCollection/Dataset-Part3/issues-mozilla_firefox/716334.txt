Mac OS 10.6.8
Nightly: 12.0a1 (2012-01-07)

1) open single window
2) set in preferences 'when Nightliy starts: show my homepage' (e.g. www.google.com)
3) press fast CMD-T to open a new window


Actual results:

sorry I mean in step 3: press >>> CMD-N  <<<
Also happens on Windows, as mentioned in bug 720020
*** Bug 720020 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I can't reproduce this (on Windows 7).
I can. Anything I can do to help debug it?
Tracking for 12, although I was able to reproduce the titlebar being rendered separately from the toolbar in FF10 on OS X. Presumably this bug is tracking a significant slowdown in the rendering though.
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/All doesn't list a module owner for Themes. Who's in the best position to drive this investigation from the engineering side?
I don't think this depends on the "always show the tab bar" pref.

patch

I think this helps... the tab container constructor runs before the load handler, so bug 618770 caused syncUI to run earlier.

patch

This fixes the bug for me, at least as originally reported in bug 720020 on the profile that I could reproduce the problem.

I see a different thing now: I don't see a first step with glass, but I see the browser window rendered before session store kicks in (i.e. with a blank tab at first). However, AFAICT this still happens without this patch on other profiles where I could not reproduce the bug. It seems that it's a different bug that was mitigated by this one? (as the first render of the browser was later, the initial image that I saw already had my app tabs restored)

patch

[Triage Comment]
From reading the patch, this is low risk. It's also had a couple of days of bake time. Let's land on Aurora 12.
This has caused a serious regression under Linux.  (see bug 734273) I don't think landing on Aurora is very good idea.

"themes" are largely app-specific - the relevant module in this case is "Firefox".

Verified in Firefox 12 beta 4. No display issue spotted now when opening new windows. Toolbar is rendered as normal.
