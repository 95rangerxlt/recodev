Some Firefox UI pages (about:accounts, about:preferences) have been using subsetted, embedded versions of Fira and/or Clear Sans fonts, instead of relying on the standard UI font of the host operating system.

As discussed in bug 992650 and bug 1007629, this is bad for i18n, as well as having a number of other drawbacks from both a performance and design PoV. The patches in those bugs propose to switch the content pages in question to use a standard system font instead.

Once that is done, we will no longer have any users of the .woff files we're currently shipping as part of the desktop browser product. So we can remove them and save a bit of download size / installed footprint.
