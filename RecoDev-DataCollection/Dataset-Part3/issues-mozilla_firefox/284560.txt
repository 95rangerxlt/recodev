String 'en' matches 'en-us', so we cannot add language 'en'.

This patch also fixes:
Bug 284088 - Removing the first language in list doesn't work properly

patch

Looks OK, but fix these nits:

>+        languagesArray.push( item.id );

No whitespace around item.id.

>+    var string = languagesArray.join(',');

These files standardize on " for quotes, not '

... then r=ben@mozilla.org
I fixed the nits and checked this in. 
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
