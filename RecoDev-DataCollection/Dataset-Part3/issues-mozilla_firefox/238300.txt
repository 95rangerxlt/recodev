Camino is also the same notation as firefox.
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; ja-JP; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040321
Camino/0.7+
Confirming that this is wrong on latest builds (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC
Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040322 Firefox/0.8.0+). Can't find any
dupes.

See relevant page from HIG:

Camino suffers the same problem, but this will have to be a seperate bug because
it has different menu code (a .nib).
depends on Bug 232919.
I didn't even realize Firefox wasn't using a nib. Carbon applications can get a window menu "for free" by 
calling CreateStandardWindowMenu.

OSStatus CreateStandardWindowMenu (
   OptionBits inOptions,
   MenuRef * outMenu
);

See:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Window_Manager/wind_mgr_ref/
function_group_21.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CreateStandardWindowMenu
HARUNAGA Hirotoshi's comment that this depends on Bug 232919 is incorrect. Addressing the UI is 
separate frm addressing the heuristic.

Proposed patch

Proposed patch - removes the superfluous word "Window" from the minimize and
zoom options on the MacOS X Windows menu and rearranges them so that Minimize
occurs first, as per the Apple HIG.

superreview isn't required for Firefox.  Bruce, if you need someone to check
this in, let me know

waiting on clarification on tree rules for 0.9 on the 1.7 branch before
committing anything there.

this isn't really something to block 0.9, maybe the Aquafication release, but
this'll land before 0.9 anyway
checked in for 0.9 on MOZILLA_1_7_BRANCH at 2004-04-25 12:28
In Thunderbird, the same problem is still being reproduced.

0.6branch build
version 0.6 (20040501)
The Thunderbird problem needs to be raised as a separate bug againt the
Thunderbird product.
