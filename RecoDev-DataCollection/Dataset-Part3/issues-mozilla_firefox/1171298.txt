The ConsoleAPI prefix currently only shows in the console via dump but should also appear in the Web/Browser Consoles.

The jetpack test-plain-text-console.js test seems to be failing in that push.  Had to figure out how to run it, but it seems to pass locally for me.  Anyway, here's the incantations to test it locally

cd addon-sdk/source
source bin/activate
cfx test --binary /path/to/objdir/dist/Nightly.app -f test-plain-text-console.js

I did another try push, although I don't know why it would be any better: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=3193d59fb3d4

The colon and space now get added by default for dump output.

Looks ok and I assume the tests pass

I confirmed that debugging a newer browser from an older client (via connect screen) and that debugging an older server with a new client (via WebIDE) doesn't break anything.  LGTM if the tests are green

Nit: to get closer to 80 chars:

let {ConsoleAPI} = Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/devtools/Console.jsm", {});

Looks like some extra info's here.  If these are intentional, then please add some more context in the messages.

Just a note: we took a look at this alignment on the timestamps and prefixes when testing across a variety of log types and zoom levels, and 3px margin top did seem better aligned with the message content than the current 4px
