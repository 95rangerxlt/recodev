Screenshot showing jagged installer icons

As you can see in the attached screenshot, the installer icons look pretty jagged next to the IE7 installer's as well as those for FF and Bon Echo.

New icon to use

The reason the icon looks jagged is because the icon included in the installer only has 16-color and 256-color images.  The smoothness seen in Vista (and in XP) comes from the use of 32-bit-color images (16M colors + alpha channel).  This attached icon is identical to the one currently in use except that it has the 32-bit-color images restored and should thus look smooth on XP/Vista.

fyi: iirc the current icon had the 32 bit images removed to decrease the installer size and the size increase is approximately 10K
Thanks for the new icon Kai Liu

I'm not sure if this is a blocking bug, tbh, since the installer is a pretty transient thing, but 10k seems like a small price to pay for professionalism.

Requesting approval for 1.8.1.2 - adds a new setup.ico that includes 32 bit images.

Approved for 1.8 branch, a=jay.
Checked in to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH. Also had a couple of additional files to check in to trunk.
Filed Bug 368524 for Thunderbird and Bug 368525 for Sunbird to update their 7zSD.sfx to include the 32 bit images.
Icon looks good to me on trunk using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a2pre) Gecko/20070130 Minefield/3.0a2pre. Will verify on branch when I launch that build.
i can confirm #11 looks good on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US;

verifying fixed on the 1.8 branch, using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2pre) Gecko/2007020604 BonEcho/2.0.0.2pre. The icon looks very crisp, in comparison to the Seamonkey installer icon which is quite jagged (hint to Seamonkey folks to fix their icon on Vista). Adding verified keyword.
