related to bug 283640 ?
Hitting Allow, Block, or Allow for Session throws this uncaught exception. Looks
like we are missing some strings.

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIStringBundle.GetStringFromName]" 
nsresult: "0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)"  location: "JS frame ::
XStringBundle :: getString :: line 17"  data: no]
Same thing happens with all exception lists under Content as well.
