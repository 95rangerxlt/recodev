what about on current nightly builds? the build you are using is over two months
old and problems may get resolved in that long of a time.  I know there were
issues on the 1.5 branch that necessitated a 1.5.1 release for OS X
Latest nightly built does not show this bahaviour. On the other hand, There is a
problem with the bookmarks. The bookmarks toolbar shows the contents of the
personal bookmark folder, NOT the contents of the bookmarks toolbar folder.

Please forgive me if this bookmark bug does not belong here.

Tab closing delay has been fixed. Not sure about the bookmarks issue, but that
should be a separate bug.
