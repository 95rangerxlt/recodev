The e10s team originally held off due to high crash rates caused by e10s. Worst offenders have been fixed after uplifts. There's one top crasher related to a11y which we need to sort out in bug 1182097. We have fixes but the a11y team is thinking of disabling.

Once that's resolved we'd like to turn e10s on by default for all of aurora. Currently we have about 50% of the user base enabled and the bug flow from those users seems pretty light. Things look pretty good for turning on by default.

ni'ing dcamp since I think he's the person who should sign off on this.
a11y team confirms they've decided to disable e10s a11y on 41 if e10s is enabled.
cpow aborts fix, which just uplifted yesterday.
Let's keep a close eye on feedback for the next few days, but I'm ok with this.
Bug 1188605 has accidentally disabled e10s for all aurora users (or will, whenever that hits the next Aurora build)
Err I mean bug 1182097

Enable e10s by default on Aurora

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: enabling e10s by default on aurora
[User impact if declined]: currently aurora is opt-in to e10s (through a popup on startup). We want to default it to enabled to get more users on e10s
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: there are e10s and non-e10s version of mochitests running on central and aurora
[Risks and why]: risk of e10s bugs causing problems to Aurora users. Dcamp has signed off for this on comment 4
[String/UUID change made/needed]: -
Tracking and setting status to affected to reflect actual status.

I'm concerned about enabling a default configuration on Aurora that doesn't match what we'll ship in 42. 42 being the next major Firefox release, we need to track stability and other quality criteria from our prerelease populations. Given that 50% of the Aurora userbase is already on e10s, what value do you expect to get by enabling e10s by default on this channel at this time? What is your outstanding bug count and blocking bug count? Are you short on work at this point?
Passing the buck to dcamp, who I believe made (or at least approved) the call.

Enable e10s by default on Aurora

There are several reasons why I do not feel comfortable approving this uplift. 

1. Firefox41 is one week away from entering Beta channel.
2. Features of this magnitude should ride a full Aurora cycle to take maximum benefit of Aurora end-user base exercising the code giving us more time to stabilize the quality.
3. I searched the FF41+ tracked bugs and there are >10 open bugs out of which 4 are crashes. There are 2 bugs tagged as topwin-crashes. This kind of data does not give us enough confidence whether we are ready to enter Beta phase with e10s on by default.
4. There are 93 (!!) bugs with title [e10s] & "status-firefox41:affected". There are 4-5 bugs in that list which are about different add-ons that don't work in e10s. Again, this kind of data is not very reassuring.

I would like to suggest that we turn e10s on by default in a week when FF42 goes to Aurora. Let's use a 6-week cycle to evaluate how ship-ready this is on our Aurora end-user base. Thanks!
The code from this patch is contained to enable e10s only on Nightly/Aurora channels. It will not enable it on Beta after the uplift.

Also worth mentioning that the patch landed on mozilla-central (comment 12), so in about a week after the uplift central->aurora it will enable e10s on Aurora, unless it is backed out.
This bug is marked fixed, but I tried from developer edition 41.0a2 
reported build : 20150728004007 and 
latest build   : 20150807004008
User Agent 	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
from my windows 7 (32 bit) PC

Both are the same, meanwhile the summary has been changed, is the fixed delayed ? will it be implemented after next uplift ?
Yeah we decided not to do it for 41, only 42
