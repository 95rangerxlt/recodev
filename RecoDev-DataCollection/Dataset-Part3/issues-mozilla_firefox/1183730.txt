Mark, could you please verify that this fix works for you? I would like to approve it for uplift to Aurora and since it only landed in m-c a day or two ago, if I get a "verified" from you, I can give it the green signal today. Thanks!
I can't see this work on 42.0a1 (2015-07-21) for some reason. The Inspector tool also isn't showing me that ::after rules for the element and I'm not sure if this is a limitation in the inspector (I'm sure it does show them on content) or a reflection of why I can't see them.

:eoger, can you please have a look?

> Hrm - but I do see it work correctly locally built. Hopefully tomorrow's nightly will have it?
Ritu, I can verify this is working as expected on Nightly, so ni? to address the uplift request.
