Pre-emptively bumping down the priority for this - good to fix one day, but nothing all that important for now.

I had originally meant that this should return PROVIDER_API here. Whats the benefit/side-effect of returning null here? (Especially with the widgetExists() method you introduced in the other bug)

There are just two callers for getWidgetProvider:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm#216 nullchecks, which means it'll return a null wrapper, which IMO is correct.

http://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizableUI.jsm#1759 checks for the other values, and otherwise claims the widget may be removed, which is also correct.

If we returned PROVIDER_API, we should update both callers to check the result of gPalette.get(aWidgetId) for null.

Re-requesting review per comment #4. We can also go the PROVIDER_API route, but I think this is simpler.

Ok, fair enough :)

Should the final comment in isWidgetRemovable() though, since it currently states the fallthrough must be be a special widget, which is no longer the case. (It may make sense to eventually make getWidgetProvider() return PROVIDER_SPECIAL for special widgets.)
