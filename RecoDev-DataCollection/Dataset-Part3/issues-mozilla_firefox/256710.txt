I can confirm this on aviary branch, build 20040823.

Bug occurs on all pages, not just pages with frames/framesets.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Right click on page to open "View Page Info"
2. Go to "links" tab.
3. Turn on the "Target" and "Access Key" columns

Actual Result:
"Access Key" values appear in "Target" column.

Expected Result:
"Target" column should show target attribute of links

This bug can be more easily observed when viewing a page that has some
accesskeys defined such as http://www.mozilla.org/
