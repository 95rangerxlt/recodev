Considering all the limitations, I think the most workable short-term solution is to:
- Build GTK3 and its missing dependencies from Centos 6 so that it can be used under the source tree.
- Package it and upload to tooltool.
- Use it from tooltool on try.

The main problem is doing step 1.

Sounds reasonable. Who's on the hook for this?
I should have been more explicit in my need info :)  Chris, we need you to tell us who has the skills to do it.  We're assuming you'd know.

Apply this patch to your try push to do a Gtk+3 build

This is the first ever Mozilla-automation built Gtk+3 Firefox, with tests running (although as of writing, they are all pending ; at least the build went through):
  https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=ee1398e6b7d9

It's m-c as of several hours ago + bug 1027034 + bug 1027040 + a backout of bug 984075 (as a workaround for bug 1027138) + the removal of --enable-warnings-as-errors from browser/config/mozconfigs/linux64/common-opt (as workaround for bug 1027009)
Note this is linux64 only.
Here is another attempt with the addition of the patch from bug 1027000:
   https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=bc15590460f6

Someone will have to take a look at all those test oranges and file bugs (don't worry about the orange B, it's a linkage problem that's part of this bug)
And with the patch from bug 1027440:

Add mozconfig magic for Gtk+3 builds

With this landed, the only change that will be required to do try pushes for Gtk+3 is tooltool manifest changes.

Add mozconfig magic for Gtk+3 builds

Actually, better to use a less generic directory name. I'll change the tooltool archives accordingly.

Add mozconfig magic for Gtk+3 builds

Looks good! Maybe just a quick comment before the 'if' that gtk3 comes from tooltool.

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=fbed7741fe42
(That try doesn't apply the patch from bug 1027497 so it crashes in gtest, and we're still in need for a proper fix for bug 1027138 instead of the backout of bug 984075.

Work in this particular bug is done, though, everything is setup so that one can do Gtk+3 try builds. I'll blog about this after bugs 1027497, 1027138 and 1027009 land.

> Note this is linux64 only.

Hey, is the final patch that landed in here also only supporting linux64 builds for GTK3 trys ?
I'm using your patch to drive runs (by the way, it works fine, thanks) and was wondering if I could do 32 bits now.
The last version of the patch does 32 bits too. You can also start from elm. http://glandium.org/blog/?p=3299
