I think that, now that we have browser tabs in the device panel,
the only reason to keep the old Connect screen is to be able to open a toolbox for the main process.
Also, the connect screen is painfull to use as there isn't the adb helper,
and that's the only way to get a shell.html's toolbox.
I know we have the UI v2 coming, but that wouldn't be hard to implement this in the current version and would ease debugging various low level stuff in Gaia/b2g.

The Connect screen is still used with Fennec, so don't try to delete it yet! :)
Ah, never mind, I miss read.  I guess you are handling the remaining use cases here.

Add main-process debug button

This patch is quite conservative.
It only displays the button if:
- the device has the certified pref turned on in the device (i.e. tab actors for the root actors are available),
- the devtools.chrome.enabled is on in Firefox, so that this button isn't displayed
for regular apps developers in the simulator (May be that's too overkill?)

The button is displayed in Device panel, in the header.
Yep, that's not my plan to get rid of it. I just want to ensure we no longer need it for any usage.
