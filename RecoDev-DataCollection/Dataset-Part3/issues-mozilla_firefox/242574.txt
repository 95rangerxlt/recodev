Per a conversation with Ben and Brian.

When clicking on a URL in thunderbird, it always opens in an existing Firefox
window instead of a a new window. Probably an issue with how we are processing
the DDE request.

When I walk through this in the debugger everything works OK! Incoming DDE
requests are opened in a new window. 

In the debugger we go through:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/xre/nsNativeAppSupportWin.cpp#1506

the newWindow argument here always defaults to TRUE so links are opening in a
new window

However, when I run an optimized build we go back to the unexpected behavior of
always opening in the existing window. I see a code path where this could be the
case but I can't get it to happen in the debugger. There is another DDE call:
HandleDDENotification which always defaults to using an existing window:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/xre/nsNativeAppSupportWin.cpp#1190

it explicitly says "open in existing window"

I'm not sure what dictates that routine from being called in place of
HandleRequest yet.
this looks interesting:

This is similar to bug 172962, except that bug 172962 is asking for a pref
rather than a sane default.

This is a duplicate of bug 229919.

Weird, this seems magically fixed. 
Nope, I don't think it is fixed yet.  I don't know where the magic came from for
you...
