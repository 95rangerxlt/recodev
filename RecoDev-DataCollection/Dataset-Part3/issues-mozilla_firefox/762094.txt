patch v1

We need a solution for bug 754671 first. As it stands, bug 744388 should be backed out from Firefox 15.
I'm not sure how this is related? We're working on a fix for bug 754671 and whether or not we back it out from Fx 15 shouldn't affect Fx 16 and this bug.
The reasoning for removing the fallback is that Firefox 15 has bug 744388 (so the new cache would be filled when people get Firefox 16), so whether or not this remains true seems directly relevant...
Yes, you're totally right. Please disregard my previous comment. This bug needs to wait until we have a decision for 754671.
