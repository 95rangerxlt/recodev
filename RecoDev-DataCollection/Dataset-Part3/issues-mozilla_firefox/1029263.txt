Story:

As a product owner I want to create five test “cells” from the EN-US Beta population so that I can measure satisfaction with different search providers and consumer messaging.

Acceptance Criteria:

*Each cell will contain 30,000 users
*Cell 1 will be a control group.  Users in this group will continue to have Google as their default search provider.
*Cell 2 will be offered Search Provider #1 (SP1) as their default search provider and be shown no notification in product that we have made the change.
*Cell 3 will be offered SP1 as their default search provider and will be shown a notification in product that we have made the change. 
*Cell 4 will be offered Search Provider #2 (SP2) as their default search provider and be shown no notification in product that we have made the change.
*Cell 5 will be offered SP2 as their default search provider and will be shown a notification in product that we have made the change. 
*Every member of every cell must have Google as their current default search provider.

RE #1, sure you want that?  (unless it's coming from John).  It affects the sampling distribution and excludes a ton of profiles.
came from John.  these requirements will likely change as john gets more info.
Broken down to bug 1029776, bug 1029792. All related tasks are together in bug 1029746.

Please also add new information to bug 1029776 if the requirements to the cell control group change.
I've updated bug 1029776 but adding here as well:

Amendment to acceptance criteria:
*Each of the five cells should contain 10% of the EN-US Beta population.
