add an access key for view.details

kurt points out that we currently have:

<!ENTITY view.details.accesskey    "">

note, in places.xul, we have:

accesskey="&view.details.label;">

which should be view.details.accesskey

Fix the accesskey

Trivial fix (sorry for stealing the bug, kurt).
No problem, I was going to get to it this afternoon though ;)

Wow, that was fast!  Thanks Seth and Kurt.  :-)
This doesn't need to be in Litmus. I'm sure it can be checked in a automated test harness.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
