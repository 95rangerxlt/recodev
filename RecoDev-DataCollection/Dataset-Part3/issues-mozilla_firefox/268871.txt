Many RSS feeds (particularly, it seems, RSS 2.0) that are saved as live 
bookmarks display a "live bookmark feed failed to load" error, even though 
these feeds are validated through the http://www.feedvalidator.org/ website.  
From the casual observer of the raw XML, there seems to be nothing in common 
about these feeds other than their failure to pull up.  Is it possible the 
built-in Firefox RSS/Atom reader is not recognizing all the valid RSS 2.0 specs?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.abcnews.com/ or http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/
2. Click on RSS button in lower, right-hand corner, select feed to add as 
bookmark.
3. Go to "bookmarks" and select one of the saved feeds.  They will display the 
error "live bookmark feed failed to load"
4. Look at the properties of this feed.  Copy and paste the feed url and then 
go to http://www.feedvalidator.org/  Paste the feed URL and submit it for 
validation.  The feeds validate perfectly.

Actual Results:  
Was able to confirm that the feeds failed to load every single time.  These 
same feeds load perfectly using other RSS/Atom feed reader services, such as 
Bloglines, Yahoo, Amphetadesk, etc.

Expected Results:  
The software should have correctly parsed the RSS XML and produced headlines 
for these feeds.

Created attachment 165426
screenshot of abcnews RSS feed load failure (validated RSS feed)
Also can be duplicated on http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/
Also can be duplicated on http://www.espn.com/
Works for me on espn.com (http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/news)

Can you reproduce this on 1.0?
all of these feeds WFM with Windows XPsp2 FF1.0 
Errors occurred using version Firefox/0.10.1

Firefox/1.0 works.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
