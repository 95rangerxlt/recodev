Since I´ve update to firefox-3.7a6pre and also since update to firefox-4.0b2pre all combination with AltGr (like @, €) doesn´t function in FF. It´s not a fault in Windows. There they´re function. But in FF they function neither in the websites nor in the navigation, search aso.. I´ve tested also in the Safe Mode with the same result. And the Error console don´t say anything when I´ve tried it. If a keyboard with German Layout (QWERTZ). If I change the Layout in Windows to EN there´s the same result.

(some of the keys with AltGr in the german Layout:
@€µ²³{[]}\~|
)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type a key with AltGr
Actual Results:  
nothing

Expected Results:  
The key I want.
For example:
AltGr + Q = @
AltGr + E = €
AltGr + ß = \

I´ve a German Keyboard Layout.
