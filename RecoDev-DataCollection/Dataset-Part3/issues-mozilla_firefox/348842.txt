See also 343076.  I don't know if you want to use www or add-ons as the service; depends on where you want primary control for the disposition to rest.

Boldly marking as blocking beta2, per yesterday's conversations.
What's the canonical service name for add-ons? add-ons or amo?
Dietrich, is the following right in order to produce a URL like:

http://en-US.add-ons.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/dictionaries/

First, in browser/app/profile/firefox.js at line 80:

-pref("browser.dictionaries.download.url", "https://addons.mozilla.org/%LOCALE%/firefox/%VERSION%/dictionaries/");
+pref("browser.dictionaries.download.url", "https://%LOCALE%.%SERVICE%.mozilla.com/%LOCALE%/firefox/%VERSION%/dictionaries/");

and then, if I understand things right, it would be in /browser/base/content/browser.js at line 5289:

-      var uri = gPrefService.getCharPref("browser.dictionaries.download.url");
+      var uri = formatURL(gPrefService.getCharPref("browser.dictionaries.download.url"), {SERVICE: add-ons});

That about right?

That's correct-ish. The function will get the pref for you if you set the last parameter aIsPref=true:

formatURL("browser.dictionaries.download.url", {SERVICE: "add-ons"}, true);

Use formatURL
Isn't the site/service "addons", not "add-ons"?  Or is the service called "add-ons"?

Hardcode "add-ons" instead

As per discussion on IRC, we shouldn't be using %SERVICE% as a freeform variable. Instead, just hardcode the service name.

vlad: now that bug 347944 has moved this code to /toolkit, is this patch still correct?

mwu tells me that moving the code won't affect this patch, so carrying over r=vlad, and giving a=beltzner on behalf of drivers.

Please only check this in *after* bug 347944 has landed, otherwise you'll break things in naughty ways.
