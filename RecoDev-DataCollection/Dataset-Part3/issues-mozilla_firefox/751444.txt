We need to replace <label> usage within the About dialog with proper elements for links so users can Tab-navigate through the dialog.

The links and buttons should also be clickable via keyboard.

FWIW, this works fine for me on Windows. The label elements that are links via the appropriate class are navigable via the tab key. Note that if you're on Mac, you need to set the "Tab key moves to all focusable elements" checkbox in System Preferences, Keyboard Settings. Firefox honors this setting. If this is not set, Tab will only navigate to text fields.
Oh ok, I just tried on Windows using Tab + Enter and was able to get it to work, although there are no focus rectangles to show which link will be activated. We may be able to keep everything as-is but add the necessary CSS styling to show the focus rects. I'll play with it and see what I can come up with. Thanks Marco!

This is automagically handled for HTML, no? (keyboard navigation triggers the outline, mouse nav does not)

Another mark against XUL?

Added an outline-color and changed the selector to use :-moz-focusring instead of :focus.

I see some code using ThreeDDarkShadow for some outlines, but I guess you're using highlight because of the dark background in the about dialog for Nightly/aurora/beta, right? If it still looks good in the release version (light background), then it's fine

You need to omit the color, ThreeDHighlight isn't going to work in all cases.

Removed the outline-color since outline-color will use the value of the color property as the initial value.

I backed this out, since this patch didn't change the existing focus ring's color, it added a second one around it.
