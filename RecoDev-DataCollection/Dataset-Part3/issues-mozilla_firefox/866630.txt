Aurora 20130428 on Windows XP

If you start Aurora (with about:home), open the gcli, go to a page - let's say http://www.faz.net/ - and then type |cookie list| into the gcli, an error will be shown:

TypeError: context.enviroment.document.location is null

If I close the gcli, open http://www.heise.de , open the gcli, go to a http://golem.de and type |cookie list|, I get:

TypeError: can't access dead object

I once had also an error which contained .promise, but didn't manage to reproduce it and don't remember the exact text.

This should be fixed by bug 839862.
