Back and forward buttons are now centered vertically, but they should be stretched like other buttons.

When I checked the patch on my (up-to-date) UX checkout, OSX, it broke the world. Did you check all platforms?
I checked Linux. I don't have OS X and it's unclear to me how this could break "the world". Can you attach a screenshot?

'break the world' is a phrase I have adopted from Gijs... might be a bit excessive :)

This should maintain current behavior on Windows and OS X.
Dão, when trying this patch on Linux (Ubuntu Unity theme) I noticed that the height of the back/ forward buttons will be stretched to almost the full height of the navbar. I guess/ know that is intentional, but now the fact that the back button has no margin-end, thus hugs the urlbar, is really visible. Something to fix in this bug, or in a followup?

Meanwhile, I'm checking Windows...

That's being fixed in bug 925710.
