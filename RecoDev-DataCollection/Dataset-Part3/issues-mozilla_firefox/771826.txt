socialui.patch


full ui patch including the toolbarbutton, sidebar panel, strings (dtd), show/hide and enable/disable command setup.

this patch is for early feedback
FWIW, if you |hg add| the image files, they'll show up in the hg diffs (you might also need to enable [diff] git = 1 in your ~/.hgrc if you haven't already, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Installing_Mercurial#Configuration).

Let's just add strings to browser.dtd

>diff -r a8f682801a6d browser/base/content/browser-menubar.inc

>+# XXX temporary addition of menuitem to help visual testing of enable/disable
>+              <menuitem id="social-togglenable-toolsmenu"

>+                        type="checkbox"/>

There's some conflict with bug 764872 here (social.js conflicts too) - perhaps this work should be based on top of that. And then the sidebar pieces should probably be on top of this (in bug 755136).

>diff -r a8f682801a6d browser/base/content/browser.xul

>+<?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://browser/skin/social/social.css" type="text/css"?>

Similarly, this stuff should go in browser.css.

>diff -r a8f682801a6d browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/social/social.dtd

>+<!ENTITY social.label               "Social">
>+<!ENTITY socialShare.accesskey      "F2">
>+<!ENTITY social.toolbartext         "Social Browsing">
>+<!ENTITY social.prefslabel          "Manage Social Services...">

These strings look unused.

>+<!ENTITY socialsidebar.label        "Show Social sidebar">

We'll probably want to add this to the View->Sidebar menu, so the label would just be "Social"

>diff -r a8f682801a6d toolkit/components/social/SocialServiceWindow.jsm

>+function getWebProgressListener(aOrigin) {

We'll probably want to give this a more unique name (getSameOriginEnforcingListener?)

>+  return {
>+    QueryInterface: function(aIID) {

You could use XPCOMUtils.generateQI. Though, is nsIWeakReference really necessary? I thought the webprogress only held strong refs to listeners. If so, we can just remove the QI impl entirely (xpconnect deals just fine without one).

socialui.patch

built on top of patches from bug 765874 and bug 764872

Jared, this stomps a bit on your work in bug 764872, but I just needed to see enabled and sidebar toggling work from the toolbar.
As a heads up, I'm in the middle of fixing up the review comments from Gavin and splitting the work from 765874 in to a UI-agnostic module and the UI-facing part will most likely bit rot this work.

toolbarui.patch

for initial feedback.  patch implements ui for toolbar as well has hooking up ambient notifications, status panels and feature enable/disable toggling.  needs tests still.  This is built on top of patches from bugs 771877, 771980, and 765874.

The parts of this patch that focus on enabling the social browsing features should be part of bug 764872. I'll update that patch today.

Mockup: Different states of social toolbar ui

For this design to be cohesive in the Firefox toolbar, we need to apply some of our own styles onto the icons supplied by social networks so that they blend better with native icons and styling.  I'm attaching a mockup of the potential states the toolbar could be in - if there's any I'm forgetting, please let me know!

just the UI pieces, trimmed down

This makes a few changes and trims down the code a little bit. This regresses the appearance somewhat on Mac, but results in simpler code - I think we should work on improved styling in followups. It also removes some functionality - the toggle menu items, the provider list, and removes strings from the "profile" area to avoid 110n issues. All stuff we can revisit on top of this patch - I just wanted to reduce scope and get this landed ASAP. We're going to need to iterate a bunch on the exact functionality and some edge cases, too.

The windows styling in this patch is probably broken, I haven't tested it at all.

I think this panel should have hidden="true" and noautofocus="true" attributes.
Re-landed with those changes, which fix the a11y test failure:

This may be related to 774725.

On Windows the toolbar is not showing up properly.  Turn on social.enabled and the issue will be obvious.
