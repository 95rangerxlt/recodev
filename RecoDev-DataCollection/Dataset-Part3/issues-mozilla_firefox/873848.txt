WIP 1

This is makes the developer toolbar and gcli appear like what it is in the mockups from http://shorlander.dropmark.com/85185/1111799 and http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/files/devTools-toolbox-i02/devTools-toolbox-i02.html

It also cleans up a lot of things (one unused icon, one class, some css from browser.css, some html from browser.xul etc.).

Current behavior that I have : http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/files/devTools-toolbox-i02/devTools-toolbox-i02.html

The patch is right now windows aero only.

Ugh, I meant http://i.snag.gy/bgMqH.jpg
Created attachment 751806
patch v0.1

refactored a lot of styles, removed unused png and made some png's unused to remove them.

The previous screenshot has a margin b/w the gcli input textbox and the wrench icon to tell them both apart in the checked state of the wrench button. This patch removes that margin, and it looks like this ( http://i.snag.gy/j3WWk.jpg ) now. I would like Stephen's opinion here, are the two differentiable, should I change the background of the button, etc.

I would also need some help on the wrench icons to make them similar to the paint flashing icon set : chrome://browser/skin/devtools/command-paintflashing.png . The one that I am using here has a weird blue tint. (because of my poor photoshop skills)
Added Dao for the browser side changes in browser.css and browser.xul, Joe for the gcli and toolbar changes and Heather for the overall style changes.

On osx, the ">>" icon is missing, and there's an extra padding at the bottom of the toolbar.

Fixed locally. Is everything else okay ?

Why "auto"?
We usually use pack and align to center images (if this is the goal).

I guess if you do that, we don't need to use "toolbox-close" in toolbox.xul,
but just the devtools-closebutton class.

patch v0.2

Changes in the patch: 
- removed styles related to #toolbox-close and directly using .devtools-closebutton to render the close button.
- moved the develoepr toolbar related stuff form browser.css to commandline.inc.css (shared, single place, outside of browser.css \0/)
- fixed missing commandline-icon.png on osx

Nope, and I don't even remember why I put it there now ... removed.

Why "auto"?
We usually use pack and align to center images (if this is the goal).

The goal here is to make the wrench button take some extra width with the icon in center. I am not trying to just align the icon in the center, but to give some specific margin so as to meet the mockups.

Great catch. Moar CSS remocal!!!

gcli popup changes

This is second patch on top of patch v0.2
this contains:
- Left out class="devtools-closebutton" for toolbox close button on windows.
- GCLI popup changes to have consistent background color and border color.

Why do you remove the ::moz-selection code for Linux, but not for osx?
> -        <toolbarbutton id="toolbox-close"
> +        <toolbarbutton class="devtools-closebutton"

We use this id: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/framework/toolbox.js#202

Remove only the CSS code.
The delete button is not very visible in the variable view on osx:

>  .variables-view-delete {
> -  list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/devtools/toolbarbutton-close.png");
> +  list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/tabview/close.png");
>    -moz-image-region: rect(0,32px,16px,16px);
>    opacity: 0;
>  }

Maybe we want a specific icon for that.

Also - please validate the UI changes you made for the debugger and the webconsole with Victor and Mihai.

As in ? Earlier also we were using the active state of a close button only.

Already done. I changed after taking their permission

Umm. missed that. So, is the selection color required ? If yes, I will not remove from both places, otherwise, will remove from both places.
> is the selection color required ?

I think it is.

combined patch. Adresses comments. Uses new icon

Using the new icon provided by Stephen. He also suggested that we loose the hover/active/checked background colors from the wrench button so that it remains visibly different from the input box of gcli.

Added back the moz-selection colors.

Let's not make our devtools Delete button depend on the look of the Firefox tab close button. It's even more important today because we are redesigning the tabs in Firefox (Australis).

We want a proper icon here.

Beside that, r+

final patch

Adding a separate icon for the remove button for debugger's watch list. Basically using the same icon as before, just cropped the icon to have only one of the three states.

Carry forward r+ from Paul

We talked over IRC and this is dead code that is just being removed, but it should be called out in the commit summary since it seems to have nothing to do with the new design for the developer toolbar :)
