We need to generate custom MARs for the 1.5.0.11 update. The only change needed should be to add more remove statements to the manifest files.

The unwanted files left after an update can be found in the log files here:
http://people.mozilla.org/~rhelmer/logs/15011-majorupdate-test1/

These were generated with the update verification scripts:

convert MAR to add more remove instructions, rev. 1

Here's the script. It needs mar. Run it with

remove-searchplugins.py firefox-2.0.0.3.complete.mar firefox-2.0.0.3.complete.major.mar

convert MAR to add more remove instructions, rev. 1

I don't see "searchplugins/" in the update.manifest after using this script, I just see entries like this:

remove "amazon-de.src"

>    manifest = \
>	"".join(["remove \"%(prefix)s%(search)s.src\"\n"
>	 "remove \"%(prefix)s%(search)s.png\"\n"
>	 "remove \"%(prefix)s%(search)s.gif\"\n" %
>		 {'search': search, 'prefix': prefix}

Maybe :
    manifest = \
	"".join(["remove \"searchplugins/%(prefix)s%(search)s.src\"\n"
	 "remove \"searchplugins/%(prefix)s%(search)s.png\"\n"
	 "remove \"searchplugins/%(prefix)s%(search)s.gif\"\n" %
		 {'search': search, 'prefix': prefix}

Yeah, that was stupid. It needs to be %(prefix)ssearchplugins/%(search)s

looks good to me!

Did you want to check this in anywhere? If so I have other suggestions, if not then this'll do the job.
as a one-off script that we shouldn't need ever again, I wasn't going to check this in anywhere other than in this bug ;-)

Removed files diff

I took the logs and ran them through:

grep -h 'Only in' 1.5.0.11-2.0.0.3-update-verify-*|sed -e 's/source\/Firefox.app\/Contents\/MacOS\///'|sed -e 's/source\/firefox\///'|sed -e 's/source\/bin\///'|sort|uniq|sed -e 's/Only in \(.*\): \(.*\)/\1\/\2/'>removefiles

Then grabbed the files in attachment 261319, removed the leading '+', sorted them, and diffed them against the 'removefiles' above.  This is the resulting diff.

I note that we're removing a few more files than strictly necessary (both .png and .gif images when the plugins have only one or the other), and we're leaving .autoreg and uninstall.ini.

I assume those are all intentional, and if so r=me.  I attach the diff as an FYI only.
Moving this to Firefox so I can get blocking 2004.

Remove searchplugins and whatnot for 2004, rev. 1

approved for 1.8.1.4, a=dveditz for release-drivers
Fixed on trunk and MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH. We don't need the custom MAR bits any more, because major update has been delayed past 2.0.0.4
Verified the change to mozilla/browser/installer/removed-files.in on the 1.8 branch.
