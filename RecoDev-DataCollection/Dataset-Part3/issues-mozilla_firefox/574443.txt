Bookmark editing is not working properly with the new widget, drag & drop, deleting, etc.  Drag & drop, it moves the bookmark somewhere else above where you dropped it. Deleting doesn't work at all.  They're maybe more issues, but didn't test everything.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
Bookmaarks menu should function the same as the bookmark menu

I should note this happens on my same profile from before this build.  On a new profile I don't notice this problem.
Context menu when right-click on bookmark flickers and is not staying 'on' when holding mouse steady. 

Win7 x64 here 

Properties - seems clickable, the menu closes but there is no dialog box appearing.
After going back from a new profile created with this build to my regular profile, D&D works here.. and delete worked but still seeing issues as Jim noted.

Additionally, when hovering over the context menu items, you see the hover color flicker and the widget above also flickers.
The flicking bookmarks panel and context menu are different on a new profile.
taking a look
Repeat Show and Hide "Bookmarks Toolbar",
Right Click on bookmarks/folder and Choose "Properties", Properties dialog does not popup.
Repeat Show and Hide "Bookmarks Toolbar",
Drag & Drop  does not work properly, doropped bookmark go somewhere.
I also noticed the flickering issue is happening while the bookmarks toolbar is closed.. not really while its open.

patch v1.0

This fixes D&D and commands.

I'm unable to reproduce flickering, btw it looks like another bug (could be related to D2D? ), so please file a new bug for it provided you can give me some step to reproduce the problem.
