Mark, when does this happen and how should I reproduce it?

> Mark, when does this happen and how should I reproduce it?

Hover slowly over the news feed waiting for each item to show the flyout (ie, don't click anywhere - just allow the flyout to open on hover).  Eventually you will find a news feed item that is narrower than the "usual" size - when it is displayed the problem can be seen (the anchor arrow will be too far to the left).  You may need to scroll to find such an item.

Conversely, close the flyout, then start the above process by starting your hover over the one that caused the problem above.  Then hover over a different one such that the panel resizes wider.  In this case the anchor arrow will be too far to the right and the panel will be partially obscuring the news feed.

Move the panel after resize

Attached is a patch that works around the problem by recording the position of the right-hand-side of the panel before we adjust the size, then moving the panel after the resize such that the right-hand-side ends up in the same position.  This is only done for panels with the anchor on the right.

If we take this patch, I'll open a new bug to remove this code once the underlying problem is resolved and add a reference to that new bug in a comment.

I applied the patch to see how it would work, and I got a very visual jumping around of the panel, so I wondered if using panel.sizeTo and panel.moveTo would fix it.  That didn't, but moving the panel before setting the iframe size does get rid of the visual jumpiness.

The previous css based calculations also didn't consider border or padding in content, using getBoundingClientRect allows us to get an accurate box for the body.

I think we should try and get this patch landed and into Aurora.  Note that the change to PANEL_WIN_HEIGHT might cause some flyouts to be too short today, but we can expect changes from the providers such that the calculated size will be correct making the smaller minimum appropriate.

Reason for not granting r+ is to figure out why the height/width calculations got changed.

Not sure why the height calculation got changed from using marginTop + offsetHeight + marginBottom. This calculation was also changed for the width. Can these changes be reverted?

hDiff is unused and as discussed on IRC should be removed.

updated to stick with getComputedStyle and margin sizes

A patch closer to the original, but the move happens before the size, which mixedpuppy reports causes less "shuddering" in his testing.

This comment, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=792295#c6, states that boxObject.width is deprecated and suggests using getBoundingClientRect in its place.
