empty again.
i can't reproduce this on mac or win. i checked out bookmarks.html:

1. after creating the profile, but before starting the app
2. after startup was complete
3. after shutdown was complete

is your build from source, zip or installer?
using zip build.
and no problem with 0329 build.

so one day a problem happens, and one day a problem does not happen.
I have no idea.
this might be a dupe of bug 374139. are bookmarks working for you at all in the zip builds?

I think it does not completely function yet.
sometimes default bookmarks.html is empty, like 0326/0328 build.
sometimes it is not empty, like 0327/0329 build.

but bookmarks under "Bookmarks" menu is always empty.
there are only menus, "bookmark this page"/"bookmark all tabs"...
no bookmarks listed.

and I have other bugs, bug#375297, bug#371219, as you know.
with 0401 zip build.

create new profile, start Minefield and exit.
no problem with default bookmarks.html, no bookmark-backup at this point.

repeat start/exit Minefield, till bookmark-backup is created.
bookmarks.html become empty, and created backup file is empty, too.

WFM--0405 zip build's bookmarks/backups behave as expected. No empty files.

Chalk up another one for bug #374139 ?

Very likely, as all import/export code relied on the livemark service. Thanks for verifying, Michael.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
