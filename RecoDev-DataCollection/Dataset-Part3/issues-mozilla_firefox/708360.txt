Using the "select element to hide" tool in adblock plus (w/ element hiding helper installed as well) creates a zombie compartment. e.g.

Navigate to a zdnet.com blog entry ( http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-previews-windows-8-app-store-launching-with-the-beta-in-late-february/11340 ), and select the adblock plus menu item "select element to hide" then hit the ESC key to exit that task, and close the tab. A zdnet.com zombie compartment should appear in about:memory.

adblock plus version: 2.0b.3308
Element Hiding Helper: 1.1.3a.343

This is a different issue (I am not using the context menu), and I am using a later version of ABP which includes that patch.
BTW, the adblock plus changelog is here:

https://adblockplus.org/devbuilds/adblockplus/00latest.changelog.xhtml

(I am using version #3308)
This is an Element Hiding Helper issue, has been fixed: https://hg.adblockplus.org/elemhidehelper/rev/4183d108d566. Will release Element Hiding Helper 1.1.3 shortly.
Release announcement: https://adblockplus.org/releases/element-hiding-helper-113-released. As usually, it will take longer until the new version is available on AMO as well.
