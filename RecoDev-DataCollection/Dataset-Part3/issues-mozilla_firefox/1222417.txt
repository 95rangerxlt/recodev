The filter input looks really ugly right now. Adding the .devtools-searchinput class would greatly fix the issue, in addition with "align-self: stretch" and "margin: 2px" to make sure it doesn't appear tiny.

You'll need to add className: "devtools-searchinput" here: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/memory/components/toolbar.js#81
While someone is touching this code, the previous className values should be using normal double quotes (className: "take-snapshot devtools-button" and className: "select-breakdown"), as they perform faster.

> in addition with "align-self: stretch" and "margin: 2px" to make sure it doesn't appear tiny.
You'll need to create a new rule here: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/themes/memory.css#102 with the selector "#filter".
