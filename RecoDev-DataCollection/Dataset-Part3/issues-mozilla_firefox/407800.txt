See bugzilla bug 280725. Changes were made to the xremote mechanism to move it out of the os-specific widget code and into the more generic command line code in the toolkit.

This bug implements the corresponding changes for the QNX Neutrino Mozilla based browser:
1) The xremote related code is remoted from widget/src/photon/.
2) The nsPhMozRemoteHelper.* source files remoted in step 1 are renamed to nsPhRemoteService.* and modified to work under toolkit/components/remote/.
3) Finally the photon specific code in widget/src/xremoteclient is modified so that the mozilla-xremote-client utility works as it did before.

These changes are all Neutrino-only and should not affect any other platform, and in theory cannot bust any Tinderbox builds.

Proposed Neutrino changes for xremote facility

Note that toolkit/components/remote/nsPhRemoteService.cpp and toolkit/components/remote/nsPhRemoteService.h appear as new in this patch, but they are really modifications of the removed widget/src/photon/nsPhMozRemoteHelper.cpp (under bug 280725) and the proposed to be removed widget/src/photon/nsPhMozRemoteHelper.h.

I am asking Benjamin Smedberg to review this because he made the changes for the original bug 280725. Also, he is aware of the situation where code changes under strictly photon-only source directories cannot cause any bustage because they are not part of Tinderbox builds.

Is there any verification necessary here from QA? It doesn't look like it. If not, can Max verify that the change was committed and change the keyword from "fixed1.8.12" to "verified1.8.12"?
