I can see this on Windows, too.

patch

This ensures that the Star and Go icons won't be displayed at the same time.
dao, with your fix:

1) if I configure my prefs so that I show my home page on a new window (or starting up), I see the green arrow and then the (yellow) star.

2) if I configure my prefs so that I open a blank page, I don't see the star, but I do see some movement, which I think is the splitter between the url bar and the search box appearing.  (I wonder if we fix that, would we see a Ts / Txul win?)
3) on a related note, should we have the green "go" arrow if there is nothing in the url bar?

We only display the star if [pageproxystate="valid"]... so that's by design.

It's in delayedStartup right now, moving it to BrowserStartup would be a Ts/Txul loss if anything. But I'll use this opportunity to advocate bug 393733 one again... let's get rid of the permanent splitter :)

SetPageProxyState("invalid") is in delayedStartup, too, by the way, which is what my patch works around.

Maybe as an indicator that you can/should start typing now... dunno.

Do you mean because we are first loading about:blank, and then my homepage?

Note, without your patch, I see the white star, then the green arrow, then the yellow star.

"if I configure my prefs so that I show my home page on a new window (or starting up), I see the green arrow and then the (yellow) star."

this would happen on session restore, too.  Dao, do you think this is worthy of a spin off bug?

There's some delay between starting the request and onLocationChange being called (which sets pageproxystate to "valid"), depending on your connection.

Without the patch you should see the star *and* the arrow for a split second, then then arrow, then the star. But I don't know if the proto theme is doing something odd.

Session restore should be faster if the data is loaded from cache, which should be the case most of the time... I don't know if there's something to speed up significantly. But in any case I think it's expectable that it takes a non-zero time before pageproxystate is valid. I also think displaying the star depending on this state is the right thing to do.
