There are currently two different RSS/Livemark (16x16) icons: one is just the orange glyph, the other is a white glyph on orange background. Currently they are used in the following places:

- content type (applications prefpane) 
- subscribe (location bar, and action in app prefpane) 
- live bookmark (bookmarks toolbar, library window)

We will make the content type and the live bookmarks the same, they will use the shape-on-orange-background icon. For actions, we will use the background-less glyph.

The inventory lists a special livemark folder (shape-on-orange-background + arrow) for the bookmarks toolbar. We will just use the normal shape-on-orange-background for this instead of browser/places/livemark-folder* (which can probably be removed)

In addition to this, we have matching livemark-item icons ready to be included. The current one is taken from browser/places/livemark-item* I think, can we just replace those with single 16x16 icons?

Patch

I couldn't find a way to use the RTL icon yet (indeed the Pinstripe theme doesn't do so either), this will also remove comments that no longer apply.

livemark-item-rtl.png is a leftover from a time before livemark-folder* existed. The only purpose of the RTL variant was to switch the orientation of the dropmarker image - which isn't used at all anymore and isn't even necessary in gnomestripe now.

http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/feed-icon-guidelines/ explicitly mentions not changing the orientation or displaying the icon in parts - but what's landed recently in all themes already seems to indicate we don't really care anyway ;)

Kudos to reed if he nukes the jar.mn entry and old image on checkin.

Will do, as soon as the tree reopens.

monreal, can you make sure all parts of comment #0 have been addressed?
The bookmark bar still uses the icon without background, this has to be changed I think. Alex wanted the bookmark bar icons to have the heavier feeling, like folders. The rest seems to be working fine, thanks.
Reopening to address comment #12.
