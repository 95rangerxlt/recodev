HAR collector is generating an error log when 'onNetworkEventUpdate' event is received for unknown actors. This can happen quite often (e.g. zombie requests received after the target is closed or when there is connection shared by multiple browser tabs) and it's properly handled in the code.

The error is just messing content in the Browser Console and should be removed.
