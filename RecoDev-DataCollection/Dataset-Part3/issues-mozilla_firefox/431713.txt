EULA v3.0 (txt, UTF-8)
Created attachment 318934
update EULA, EULA.rtf and EULA.xhtml to v3.0

First pass at a patch:
 - updates browser/EULA
 - updates browser/EULA.rtf (and switches ALL CAPS to bold)
 - updates browser/base/content/EULA.xhtml (and switches ALL CAPS to bold)

Note that the previous text version of the EULA v3.0 is obsolete, as Harvey and I found some errors. This diff should be taken as canonical.

Still do to:
 - update browser/branding/unofficial/license.r
 - update browser/app/profile/firefox.js#646 (to rev the version for updates)

bump version to 3, show EULA on first run for Linux

This is needed so this works right on Linux, we need to take this change at the same time.

Please make sure to test that the elifdef works correctly, or just change to using simple #ifdefs.

yes, it works.  its documented, so it better work! (also, used in /mail)
Just need to patch license.r now - I've had a look at how mento did this last time, and think I know what I'm doing. Will probably ask him for review, though.

Anyone know what file format to save that in? Mac UTF-8?

update EULA to v3.0 in all places (EULA, EULA.rtf, EULA.xhtml, license.r)

Connor, please review with attention to file format and apostrophes and such. I'm pretty sure I got it right.

Bah, messed up the hex offset in the browser/base/app/macbuild/license.r file; fixed here.

looks good to me, ship it.
mozilla/browser/EULA 	1.6
mozilla/browser/EULA.rtf 	1.4
mozilla/browser/base/content/EULA.xhtml 	1.2
mozilla/browser/app/macbuild/license.r 	1.4
mozilla/other-licenses/branding/firefox/license.r 	1.4 
Landed mconnor's patch as well:
mozilla/browser/app/profile/firefox.js 	1.331 
Had to undo the Linux default change temporarily because the EULA dialog causes havoc on the unit test/Talos machines.

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?diff_mode=context&whitespace_mode=show&subdir=mozilla/browser/app/profile&command=DIFF_FRAMESET&file=firefox.js&rev1=1.331&rev2=1.332

Will need to update the testing/talos profiles to avoid this problem.
Do you need to update browser/branding/unofficial/license.r, too, or are you projecting further changes to the EULA before the next time you alpha?  

I forget which combination of build flags gets you using that license.r, but I know it's the one that was used for official alpha releases since I found bugs in it in Alpha 1 ;)

Curses!

patch (also updates testing profiles)

I think this is probably sufficient, but I'm not entirely sure whether Talos uses automation.py for its profile creation (or whether a change in CVS will automatically be pushed to production machines).

I had to back out the change of default for Linux again, because apparently Talos doesn't use createTestingProfile.py. Will need to investigate further.
After talking with Alice and robcee, filed bug 432321 to get the changes made to the talos profiles in production.
I think we need to update build-seamonkey-util.pl to add the override pref as well, since the bloat test timed out on the linux machine when this patch was in.

This should fix the bloat test timeouts. Not sure who's best to review this.
