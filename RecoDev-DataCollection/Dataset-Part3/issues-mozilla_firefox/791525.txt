The new page rotation feature for PDFs add two items to Firefox's context menu, "Rotate Clockwise" and "Rotate Counter-Clockwise". But although we have localized the strings for them in viewer.properties, they still show up in English in the context menu.

Changing strings ids to:

page_rotate_cw.label=Rotate Clockwise
page_rotate_ccw.label=Rotate Counter-Clockwise

will fix the issue. The patch is submitted to upstream https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2136
Fixed upstream as per above.
