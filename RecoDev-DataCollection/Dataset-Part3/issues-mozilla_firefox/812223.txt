A few notes about what I seen previously....
- I couldn't reproduce after the fix in the previous bug, but that could just be by chance.
- When I could previously reproduce, I would sometimes get negative times and sometimes times of around 7 minutes, when the real download only took about 20 seconds.
- When I could reproduce, I had disabled the deleting of the temp files, and the actual time difference of the files, as checked by an independent program with similar logic, was 20 seconds and not 7 minutes.
- I thought at first when looking at the previous bug that the value of a filetime is unsigned 64-bit but NSIS only has signed 64-bit operation support.  But when I checked locally the timestamps were small enough to fit into 2^63-1

Are we planning on

1) Continuing to try to reproduce this issue
2) Add something to the ping to find out why these negative pings are coming through

If #1, how can we direct QA's testing? If #2, what changes do we plan to make?

> Sent email to Brian/Rob.

I tried last week but was unsuccessful in reproducing like I did in version 1. I'll try again today and update the bug if I get consistent steps to reproduce.
I haven't had any luck in trying reproducing this.

patch rev1

I was unable to reproduce as well. I believe this patch make the code more robust though and may very well fix this bug. I have also added a couple of more times to the ping. The ping is now formatted as follows:

http://download-stats.mozilla.org/stub/v4/Channel/Locale/InstallerExitCode/FirefoxLaunchCode/DownloadedAmount/DownloadTime/InstallTime/FinishTime/ExistingProfile/ExistingInstall/

All times are in seconds.

I also changed many of the calls to StrCpy so the string to copy is quoted as it is for strings with spaces in them for consistency.
Anurag, please note that the existing ping with this bug should have correct values for everything but the download time and can be used to evaluate the current state of the stub installer. Can I get the current data from the ping (raw format would be fine with me)? Thanks!
I pushed to try as well

I'm not sure if this returns something that is > max_int but < max_uint if this would cause it to store a negative value on the stack.

Seems like this case would just fit into the Else clause and work correctly, but I'm fine if you want to leave it.
I'll verify the behavior before pushing

This should be about as safe for getting the correct value as possible and has been tested with rolling over.

I take it the best way we are going to verify this fix is going to watch for negative download times in the logs over a few days, right?

Anurag - Can you comment here after about a ~1 week on whether you are still seeing negative download times and why?
Pushed to mozilla-aurora
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/259765eb7f05

I am holding off on landing this on beta until after a decision as to whether to land bug 811646 on beta is made so as not to bitrot that patch.
(In reply to Jason Smith [:jsmith] from comment #19)
stubinstaller-v2 showed negative times ~12 hours after launch, given we monitor the logs close to real-time, we will have an answer by noon tomorrow. Though we'll do our best, its highly unlikely for us (metrics team) to pin-point as why the negative numbers are appearing.

Beta patch - landed

Beta has STUB_PING around some of the code so I had to update the patch to handle that.
Anurag and I took a look at the v4 data for today and so far no negative download times out of 294 downloads so far.
I have also tested this manually and I havent been able to produce negative download times. I'll leave the final QA sign-off to Juan B. Thanks to everyone who worked on this
We'll have check the logs once stub installers are offered in the next beta train, but I'm comfortable marking this as verified on Aurora.
