Closing tabs "to the right" is a useful feature that many users could benefit from. It is currently implemented as an add-on (see URL field).

Some background:
When we open new tabs they appear on the end, and so naturally tabs that have a longer lifetime end up being promoted to the start-side of the bar. This leads us towards the situation where closing tabs "to the right" is a simple way of closing the ephemeral tabs.

This feature would work as another context-menu item when right-clicking on a tab, alongside "Close other tabs".

Ekanan, would you be able to work on this?

Hi, I'd be happy to work on this one if it's free. I've recently submitted a patch to another bug, waiting for review, so this wouldn't count as my first bug. But if that's still ok I think this one seems to be an interesting one to work with.

That's perfectly fine! Let me know if you have any questions.
I don't think tabs are that often actively promoted towards the left via drag & drop, but it probably happens through selective tab closure.

To provide some historical context, the directionality of this menu item is what made Faaborg reluctant to add this a few years ago, but I'm not opposed to it.

---

This will need to be "Close Tabs to the Left" in RTL mode.
Thanks, I have started going through the code and I some questions that have popped up.

I assume that the user should get a warning if more than one tab are about to be closed? In tabbrowser.xml there's the warnAboutClosingTabs function that warns if all tabs, or all but one tab, are to be closed. This is controlled by the boolean parameter aAll and the settings "browser.tabs.warnOnClose" and "browser.tabs.warnOnCloseOtherTabs".

How should it be handled here? Should a new setting be added and support be added for it to warnAboutClosingTabs? Because of RTL mode, maybe an appropriate name for it could be CloseFollowingTabs to avoid confusion?

We should use the 'warnOnCloseOtherTabs' pref to determine if we should show the dialog. The 'warnOnClose' prompt is used more for closing the full window.

How about 'closeTabsToTheEnd'?

Partial patch of a first implementation

Thanks for your input! I've made an implementation that seems to work, but I am not finished yet as I haven't added any tests and I have an idea to improve it described below, but I thought I'd show my solution this far.

I modified warnAboutClosingTabs to be able to handle a third case of counting the tabs from the context tab. I'm not particulary fond of the solution of using a string to specify the action, though I'm not used to javascript so I think it's good to get some comments on this.

I was thinking about making two methods, for example warnAboutClosingAllTabs() and warnAboutClosingOtherTabs(aToTheEnd), where the parameter is a boolean, or possibly a number specifying the number of tabs to warn about, leaving it up to the caller to count the tabs. What do you think about that?

I've tried it with forced RTL mode where it also behaves properly. Is RTL mode fixed with the locale, so that it's only a matter of localization whether the menu item should say "Close Tabs to the Right" or "Close Tabs to the Left"?

Oh, and should the removal of the tabs be animated? It's currently not.
Two things I realized afterwards: I probably shouldn't use for...in for the tabs array in removeTabsToTheEndFrom, and it would be better to use unshift rather than push in getUnpinnedTabsToTheEndFrom, so that the order of the tabs aren't reversed.

Cool! It will be great to have some tests for this :)

I think the way you've got it now is fine.

RTL mode is part of locale, so the locales that use a RTL language will have "Close Tabs to the Left" as their strings. No need for extra work on your end here :)

Be careful about calling unshift in a loop, as it will cause n^2 memory operations. Also be careful about removing items from a collection while in a loop, as the indices will change and it is easy to skip items or go out of bounds.

I think an enumerated type here may be better (basically define these values as constant strings), then you can also include a default case that throws an exception so we can make sure all callers are using the correct arguments.

Here's an example of a section of our code that defines constant strings that will be used as arguments, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/preferences/in-content/applications.js#9

The tabs should animate when closing. You can pass in {animate: true} as the second argument to removeTab.

I know you are just modifying how this previous code worked, but we should move the subtract operator to the previous line and line up the gBrowser._numPinnedTabs with this.tabs.length, like so:

Add an alias to mostRecentBrowserWindow.gBrowser.warnTabs.ALL before this line so it doesn't have to wrap. For example:

> let allTabs = mostRecentBrowserWindow.gBrowser.warnTabs.ALL;
> aCancelQuit.data = !mostRecentBrowserWindow.gBrowser.warnAboutClosingTabs(allTabs);

Indentation is off.

I don't understand why this method cares about pinned tabs. No caller seems to depend on this.

This needs a localization note about UI directions.

Good catch!

Like the close-other-tabs functionality and the implementation of the referenced add-on, I figured that pinned tabs should not be closed and that's why it explicitly ignores them. Of course, if we can rely on the pinned tabs always being before a normal tab (can we?), then that check for pinned tabs is unnecessary.

I removed it and it seems to work fine.

Yes, I was going to ask about this one. How is this handled? Is there anything I should do here?

Yes. You need to explain that "right" shouldn't be translated verbally, depending on the UI direction. A few lines below your entities you can find an existing localization note that you can take as a model.

This check seems unnecessary since the function isn't called from pinned tabs.

being that "browser.tabs.closeButtons" (about:config) is an "integer" shouldn't it put the close button to the "user set" number of tabs?
Sorry about that, I found my answer.
