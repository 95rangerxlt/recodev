Now that bug 345846 has removed the left-overs from the unix installer, we should do the same for the left-overs of the windows xpinstall installer, i.e., toolkit/locales/en-US/installer/windows/install.it and @AB_CD@/toolkit/installer/windows/install.it for l10n.

The install.it files were, AFAICT, referenced in xpinstall/packager, at least that's what mxr on the 1.8 branch claims:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/search?string=install.it&find=%2Fxpinstall%2F&findi=&filter=&hitlimit=&tree=mozilla1.8, and those files are long gone.

This would be another nice "chop dead wood out of l10n" fix, and doesn't really have any l10n impact as it's NPOB. Sadly it'd be fatal for localizers to just remove it, as compare-locales doesn't ignore it. Yet? File a bug on me if that's a better 1.9 solution.

Fix (en-US) v.1

Not sure if we want to bother with 1.9 at this point, or whether "we" need to remove all the trunk copies (for which "we" will use Axel's fingers), but this should at least get us started.

Looks good... r=me. Requesting review from Axel before this is checked in in case there are any concerns from him regarding l10n.

This looks good. As it just obsoletes the l10n files, there's no need for us to do a centralized catch-up patch for localizations.
