To reproduce:
1. open Firefox on a mac
2. right click on the dock icon

Recommendation:
Add some contextual options to the context menu on the OSX Dock Icon. Specifically add an option to open a new window.

New Window should be fixed on trunk bug 415463. I don't have a Mac to verify that it is fixed.
Bug 415463 is verified fixed (and I can confirm that, if anyone doubts)

Are there any other options you would like to have there?

I think we should support the same operations as the jump list implementation on Windows does, so these make the same operations available.

(Whether that's currently anything else than New Window I don't know, here's a good overview of what Opera supports: http://my.opera.com/portalnews/blog/2010/03/27/take-full-advantage-of-windows-7-with-opera )
This issue is fixed, I can confirm that it is fixed. We should either mark it as closed or rename the description.

We should look into the options we want and try to make the same set of changes for windows and mac (and any OS with similar integration features).
