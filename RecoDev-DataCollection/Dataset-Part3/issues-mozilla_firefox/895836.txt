Patch v1: reduce margin of the navbar in customization mode

Also noticeable on OSX. Reducing the margin to 1px seems all that's needed.

Review of attachment 821000:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you fix this anyway, can you also improve that selector to not suck quite as much? E.g.

#nav-bar[customizing="true"] > #nav-bar-customization-target

(although I wonder why we need a different margin for customization mode at all?)

And is the horizontal margin actually wrong? I don't believe so - the menu button already hugs the side of the box pretty closely. Please don't change that margin.

(r=me with the above fixed)
Pushed with preserved horizontal margins. I did not change the selector(s), because that opened up a can of worms. I file a follow-up to try and make these selectors more specific.
