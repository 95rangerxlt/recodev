So... I think something broke jamun. Pulled, clobbered, build, something in chrome JS is broken. Can't open error console, can enter customization mode but it's broken and won't exit, old app menu dpesn't get initialized properly, etc.

Bug 855830 is happening again. And:



Error: this._cps2 is undefined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 1725

_cps2 is nsIContentPrefService2, this is FullZoom.
