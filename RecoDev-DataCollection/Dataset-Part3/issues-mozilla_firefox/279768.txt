I don't think that tying the src directory structure to the one of the jar really 
brings a lot of benefit. At least, we should get module owner approval on this.

this patch clears ab-CD.jar a bit, and readds use of extra-jars.mn.

Not tested on win yet
I have some meta code for doing checkout all locales the way I would want it.

foreach (proj in MOZ_CO_PROJECTS) {
  foreach (loc in mozilla/$(proj)/all-locales) {
    foreach (foo in LOCALES_proj) {checkouts.push(l10n/$(loc)/$(foo))}
  }
}
checkouts.unique;

This would mean that we declare the available locales for each project. It seems 
like a logical thing to do, and I find all-locales files to be a headache to
maintain right now.
The only problem is, I need to load all-locales files and I need to do uniq.
I would thus prefer to code this in perl and call it. We allready use uniq.pl
from modules.mk. Though only for BUILD_MODULES!=all, AFAICT.
Adding the perl script to MOZCONFIG_MODULES would get it pulled on initial runs
just fine.

Do you plan to create a toplevel mozilla/suite dir?
a) I plan to fail gracefully on not available all-locales. I don't think that 
we actually need to error there.
b) If we port seamonkey to toolkit (bug 255807) with CVS l10n, I would expect to 
see a project tld that would contain an all-locales, yes.
Then I don't think you need perl:

$(sort
  $(foreach project,$(MOZ_PROJECT_LIST),
    $(foreach locale,$(shell cat mozilla/$(project)/all-locales),
      $(foreach dir,$(LOCALES_$(project)),l10n/$(locale)/$(dir))
    )
  )
)

I think by moving config/rules.mk above the installer target, this has changed
the default target for this Makefile from installer to the Mozilla-wide default
target.  browser/installer/Makefile.in needs to be changed to invoke make in
windows/ with the correct target (installer, in this case?) if this is the
intended behaviour.

This change leaves an extra parenthesis in this command.  Builds now fail
building the installer with:

  Syntax error: ")" unexpected
  make: *** [installer] Error 2

With a change that could (did!) break building the installers on Windows
(something that's hung Tracy up in smoketests and required my time to diagnose
in fixing), you should take greater care to test that your change actually
works as expected prior to committing it.

I'm tempted to ask you to back out the entire patch because it's obvious it
wasn't ready for prime time but I'm not sure that's strictly necessary yet --
though I think a full patch review _is_ necessary as two bugs have snuck by
already.

Would it be possible to put these files in communicator-platform/win|mac|unix/
instead?
A common en-US.jar for all platforms is handy for teams that use that file when
translating.
We're moving to server-based system. You should use http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n
as example or mozilla/*/locales where *=dom|toolkit|netwerk|browser|mail.

Those platform ifdefs are awful; reminder to self to look up who added them and
why. We do have platform-specific package capability builtin to the chrome
reigstry which differentiates between win/unix/mac.

They're conflicting on ./dom/locales/jar.mn :( It's because I made them independly.

Do these changes impact embedders (like Camino)?
Simon, they may affect embedders if you are using non-standard packaging
techniques or are using the .properties files directly from your code. I have

So... Don't embedders use embed.jar?  And isn't that packaged using embed-jar.mn
(via gen-mn.pl and GenerateManifest.pm)?  And wasn't that not modified by these
checkins?

So it looks to me like the set of changes that moved the Gecko locale files
around without changing embed-jar.mn should have broken every single embedder,
Camino included.

./mail/locales updated

it's obsolte after Scott's checkins. I'll update patch asap
The patch that moved nsProgressDialog.dtd caused a regression in Thunderbird. We
can no longer find the progress dialog DTD file, leaving XUL entity errors in
the download attachment progresss dialog instead of actually showing the
progress dialog.  See Bug #284183 for more details.
So this patch made it so only NON XUL apps actually package up
nsProgressDialog.dtd even though many of us use the helper app dialog and the
associated download progress dialog. That seems wrong:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/embedding/components/ui/jar.mn#5

We still bundle the XUL files in the build, we just no longer bundle the
associated DTD files. 

For MOZ_XUL_APP, nsProgressDialog.dtd is supposed to be packaged from
toolkit/locales/jar.mn. Gandalf, what happened here?
Ben regressed my patch with his checkin.
Ugrrrrrrrrr!

I can't understand the way he solved conflict here...
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?diff_mode=context&whitespae_mode=show&file=jar.mn&branch=&root=/cvsroot&subdir=mozilla/toolkit/locales&command=DIFF_FRAMESET&rev1=1.11&rev2=1.12
Gandalf, I believe Ben's change was accidental, r=me to add them back in.
It looks like this checkin caused bug 284428 (busted XML prettyprinting in
Firefox, because chrome://communicator/locale/xml/prettyprint.dtd loads nothing).

Also, trunk firefox doesn't show the localized text for Expat errors.  This is
also a regression from this checkin, looks like; bug 283766 covers it.
In Thunderbird, I'm now getting the following XML error at startup:

Couldn't convert chrome URL: chrome://communicator/locale/layout/xmlparser.prope
rties


followed by what looks like 30 or so NS_ENSURE_TRUE errors complaining about a
string bundle:

WARNING: NS_ENSURE_TRUE(NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) failed, file c:/build/trees/prefs/mozi
