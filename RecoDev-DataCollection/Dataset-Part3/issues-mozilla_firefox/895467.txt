STR:
  1. Open test-page-1 (it will use window.open() to open another tab)
  2. Open test-page-2 in a new tab
  3. Attempt to close the tab with test-page-2 open, causing the onbeforeunload prompt to appear. Do not select either of the options in the onbeforeunload prompt
  4. Wait until the page from step 1 calls window.close(). Once it does, a second onbeforeunload prompt will appear

Some day, hopefully the onbeforeunload prompt will be tab-modal (bug 616853). In the meantime, we need it to correctly behave like a window-modal dialog. While it is active, it should not be possible for another dialog to appear.

This is still an issue (nightly 29.0a1 (2014-01-31)). I disabled the popup blocker for this site, and after a while the popup called window.close() (I was on this bug site while that happened) and the onbeforeunload prompt displayed twice. I did not need to open test-page-2.html at all, and when I opened and closed test-page-2.html, the prompt showed once (I was unable to open both in parallel in my test, I'm too slow and tired atm).
Now that bug 616853 is resolved, this should no longer be an issue.
