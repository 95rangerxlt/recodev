Trying to open both the subviews we have at the moment ends up messing up the display, showing two subviews. Turns out the history subview doesn't include class="PanelUI-subView", which is needed to hide it.

That's the only time we use that class, and its not obvious what the consequences are if left out. We don't actually need it - all we're using it for is to match all children of PanelUI-subViews.

The seems like it would be pretty bad for performance since it would first retrieve all elements in the DOM and then check their parent. Could buildWidget just add the class?
Ugh, yes. Must remember selectors are read RTL.
