This test requires focus to work and does a bunch of direct access to the content window which fails:

765 INFO Console message: [JavaScript Error: "[object CPOW [Exception... "Failure"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/RemoteAddonsChild.jsm :: EventTargetChild.prototype.handleEvent :: line 389"  data: no]]" {file: "resource://gre/modules/RemoteAddonsParent.jsm" line: 488}]

and causes the test to time out.

This test has some custom waitForFocus type function, unclear if it is needed or if it can just be changed to use waitForFocus.

Patch

I removed the portion of the test that opened a new window and the associating interaction with file_dom_notifications.html that changed focus to the new window. The test still checks that event.defaultPrevented is true as well as that the tabs are not switched, which should be sufficient.

Although the try run looks pretty noisy, there are no failures for leaving the window around anymore with this tweaked patch.
