We need a way to alert the user that the website they are visiting is asking for geolocation data.

Aza was thinking something like this:

I am going to implement this simply using the existing notificationBox.

I may need string wordsmithing and confirmation that the accessKeys are correct.

patch v.1

um.  ignore that change to the "editBookmarkTitle" string.  fixed locally.
i created an addon for FF:

mike, is there a process we can look at for inclusion with firefox.next?

patch v.2

this uses the right browser infobar. There might be a better way to find the notification box.
changes to strings:

gelocation -> geolocation for the property names
not modifying the bookmarks string

w/ those changes, okay'ed by mconnor via irc

patch v.3

>diff --git a/browser/base/content/browser.js b/browser/base/content/browser.js

>+      var bundle_browser = document.getElementById("bundle_browser");

You can use gNavigatorBundle instead.

>+      var buttons = [{

>+        callback: function(){request.allow()},

You could use the shortened style without braces:

function () request.allow()

>+      return 1;

Does this have some special meaning?

> function delayedStartup()

>+  // hook up the geolocation prompt to our notificationBox
>+  setupGeolocationPrompt();

Putting it in delayedStartup means it might not be set up before a page tries to use this API on first load (e.g. your home page). I wonder whether we can get away with doing this in BrowserStartup() without a perf hit? How expensive is geolocation service initialization?

Seems to me like this should use a letter that's in the string. "o"?

gavin's suggestions + a better way to find the right notification bar.

patch v.4

This won't work with multiple windows (only the browsers from the first window will be searched).

The previous patch really should work. Are you sure the geolocation service is passing in the window object you're expecting it to?

>+# Geolocation UI

What about other distance units? We use metres and kilometres in Europe, feet and miles don't make sense here:
1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers
10 feet = 3.04800 meters 

What numbers should we use in localizations? Localization note would help here too.
Sorry about that.  These do not have to be exact values, but instead approximations.  For example, if you said 2km for the 1mile value, or even 1km, it would be perfectly valid.  The idea here is to give the user the general "feeling" of how accurate a position will be.

Vlado, please let me know if this l10n note will work.
Comment on attachment 336736
l10n note

Sure, this will work. Maybe you should mention
# examples: Exact Location (within 3 m)
too, so many localizers can use it without the need to google a foot -> meter conversion

Perhaps I am being thick, but there seems to be a large part of the functionality missing/broken here - I can get a website (http://browserspy.dk/geolocation.php) to ask the browser where I am, which triggers the notification bar (so far so good). I then click on a button (e.g. Neighborhood) and that's it.

At that point, since Minefield has no idea what part of planet Earth I'm at, I'm expecting some kind of dialog to pop up, so I can tell it. Instead the bar just sits there all useless and the error console has the following:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIGeolocationRequest.allowButFuzz]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: anonymous :: line 795"  data: no]

Tested with today's Minefield nightly

Is this *supposed* to work yet, or is there another bug somewhere? There's nothing on the dependency list
Is it intentional that we don't allow the user to have Firefox remember a decision for a site (cf. the screenshot for Geode at <http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/10/introducing-geode/#ibi_>)?
@doug  this was fixed for beta.


@simon  please file a seperate bug.  I think this is a good idea.  we should discuss what should the default value should be.
Adrian filed bug 462199 to make the string keys line up with what our tools like.
