Sorry this took a while but I had to obtain Windows 10 and get it running on a dev box to test this.

The string is actually "Windows NT 10.0" so we just check for "NT 10." to allow it to work with future updates.

If you want us to detect e.g. Windows NT 10.1 in the future we should change this to check for "NT 10.0"

Jeff, Do you want to be able to distinguish between 10.0 and 10.1?

I don't think so, I mainly care about major versions eg XP vs 7 vs 8 vs 10. It looks like Windows update uptake for patches is pretty high - most people running Win8 upgraded to 8.1 fairly quickly.

Seems good to me. I never remember if a change to Histograms.json requires a toolkit peer review.
If it does not, I'm happy to R+ this. Just canceling the review in the meantime.

In my experience, anyone can review that file.  But you are supposed to ask for additional privacy reviews these days, see red box[1].
