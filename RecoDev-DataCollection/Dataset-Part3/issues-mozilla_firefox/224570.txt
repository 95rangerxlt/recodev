When you try to open a external link from OS X Mail in Firebird (you have to
select Firebird as standard-Browser in the System-Prefs that you can do that)
and Firebird is already running you get the following Error:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: chrome://navigarot/content/navigator.xul
Line Number 46, Column 1:

<window id="main-window"

It does not occur if firebird is started automatically by the system to open
this link.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Firebird as Standard-Browser in System Prefs
2. Start Firebird - you can leave a window open or close it, this does not
change anything.
3. Klick on a link in the mailcontent from any Mail in Mail.app
4. Now you should get the error

Actual Results:  
As already said, you get this error

Expected Results:  
Opened the link of course.

Like this it's not possible to use Firebird as the standard Browser on the Mac...

Fixed in the latest Nighly Build
might i add that this is also fixed in Firebird 0.7.1 if you don't want to go
with a nightly
