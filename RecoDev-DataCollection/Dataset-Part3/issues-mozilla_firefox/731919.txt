File download immediately fails on starting.  On restarting the download, the file will download, but disappears from the destination folder as soon as the download completes.  To duplicate, simply attempt to download a file.  It should immediately fail.  Then attempt to "Retry" that failed download.  This time it will download, but the file will vanish from the download location in Windows Explorer once the download has completed.

Possibly related is that FF seems to crash on any "Save As" type of operation with Windows 8 Consumer Preview.  To reproduce, go to the file menu and select "Save As".  FF should promptly crash and request to send a crash report (I have submitted several at this point, just trying to ensure the above really is a bug).

This bug that appears to be specific to Windows 8 Consumer Preview.  It did not appear with the developer preview nor does it appear to occur with Windows 7/Server 2008.  I have experience it on both Win8 beta installs I have running.
