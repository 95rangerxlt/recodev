Download drop-down does not show up in e10s mode.

Steps:
1. On an e10s enabled nightly install:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/?src=ss
2. Go to youtube.com and look for a video.

Expected: You should see a Download drop-down menu that allows you to download the media in several formats.

Actual: No menu is shown.

It works in non-e10s mode.

The developer has been notified through AMO, though it looks like they were working on it already.
I used one of your github examples and changed the extension. It mostly works, but xmlhttprequest doesn't work cross-domain inside the sandbox. I couldn't find a way to fix xmlhttprequest and it's important for this extension.

I used Cc['@mozilla.org/xmlextras/xmlhttprequest;1'].createInstance(Ci.nsIXMLHttpRequest)
The xpi I linked before works for non-Vevo videos like this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEhaVhta7sI I tested it in the latest Nightly
This add-on is based on Greasemonkey, so it looks like we need to make that work first.
The latest update (1.8.1) adds support for e10s. I tested it in Firefox 20, Firefox 36 stable, Firefox 38, latest Firefox Nightly with e10s enabled/disabled.
I can confirm it's working on Nightly.

Thanks!
This doesn't appear to be working correctly: I see the added youtube download button but when I click on it nothing happens. No errors are reported in the console.

Hmm, after a restart, it appears to work.
