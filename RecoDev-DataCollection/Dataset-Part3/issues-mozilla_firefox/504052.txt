I use multitouch gestures and especially like the browser.gesture.swipe.down to scroll down to the bottom of the page. This however does not seem to work when you load a page, do a view source and do it on that window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open any page
2.Do a view source
3.Swipe down with three fingers
Actual Results:  
The page does not scroll at all.

Expected Results:  
It should go to the bottom of the page, like it does on a normal web page window

Also, please consider using the most recent Firefox 4 beta build, your bug may be resolved there.
Indeed, it seems to be fixed on my current FF version (4.0b7)
Thanks a ton!
