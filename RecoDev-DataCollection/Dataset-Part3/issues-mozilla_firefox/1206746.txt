I am on OS X 10.10.5 and have a USB connected Flame-KK device that
shows up using

adb devices

I open the WebIDE in  Nightly 43.0a1 (2015-09-21) and the device
is not listed.

I subsequently close Nightly 43.0a1 (2015-09-21) and start an old
version of Firefox 37.0.2 and attempt the same, to connect to the
device using WebIDE. This works.

Using Nightly 43.0a1 (2015-09-21) and attempting to connect to the
device using WebIDE the browser console contains the stack trace....

I've heard that main culprit is TCPSocket changes to WebIDL (bug 885982).
:gerard-majax already debugged this exception and the SDK loader is hidding the real exception here :/

This error is related to bug 885982.

https://github.com/mozilla/adbhelper/blob/master/adb-socket.js#L21-L25
  let scope = Cu.Sandbox(Services.scriptSecurityManager.getSystemPrincipal());
  scope.DOMError = Cu.import('resource://gre/modules/Services.jsm').DOMError;
  Services.scriptloader.loadSubScript("resource://gre/components/TCPSocket.js", scope);
  scope.TCPSocket.prototype.initWindowless = function () true;
  return new scope.TCPSocket();

We were fetching a TCPSocket instance from a Sandbox,
but it looks like, now, with the WebIDL, we have to set the related pref AND have a document instance.
That is quite unfortunate, especially the pref.

Josh, Do you think we can easily fetch a TCPSocket instance from chrome code (without setting the pref)?
Not as the code exists today. It may be possible to change the WebIDL files to use `Func=ShouldTCPSocketExist` instead of `Pref=` and `CheckAll=`, where ShouldTCPSocketExist would check the following:
- is the global using a system principal (something like http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/URL.cpp#161 and calling nsContentUtils::IsSystemPrincipal)
- is the preference enabled
- does CheckAnyPermissions return true (https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/bindings/BindingUtils.cpp?from=checkanypermissions#2427)

Andrew, you made a comment about socket.jsm in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885982#c54 but I don't see that file anywhere.

Note that bug 1079648 covers flipping the pref on Firefox and includes some minimal discussion of removing the preference in general.

Here is a patch to use WebIDL's TCPSocket.
It requires a firefox build with bug 1207090's patch applied.
It also cleans up adb.js from duplicated code with adb-client.js.
(I made two distinct commits to help the review)
I'm now waiting for bug 1207090's review before proceeding.

I just pushed a new revision, with a bug fixed on release (was returning new TCPSocket() result instead of socket.open() in release-TCPSocket.jsm codepath!)

Platform patch re-landed, hopefully it will stick this time.
Asking review early in order to help releasing the addon ASAP.

Looks good to me! I'll test and release once the `TCPSocket` change lands in Firefox.
Merged: https://github.com/mozilla/adbhelper/commit/558d60630ec1d1ad0d7dab883b6fa74d611d7728

Preparing a new add-on release now.
ADB Helper 0.8.1 submitted to AMO, waiting on approval.
ADB Helper 0.8.1 has been released.  It may take a few hours for the update to be available due to CDN caching.
As a side note, only 44 will work for the moment.  43 still needs bug 1207090 to be uplifted.
