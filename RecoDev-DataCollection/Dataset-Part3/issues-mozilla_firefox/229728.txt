The images didn't transfer properly when the patch for bug 165960 was applied.  
I don't have the experience with CVS to say for sure, but perhaps the images 
need to be uploaded or committed with the -kb flag to tell CVS they're binary?  
The images all show up in LXR as size 5b at this link:

I'm aware of this. I fixed this about an hour ago. The problem was that I
checked in without -kb. I'm spoiled by the MozDev CVS server which will
automatically add -kb if it detects a binary file.

I also hooked up help again. The tree shouldn't burn this time, but I'll be
monitoring it to make sure.

Jeff, until bug 229696 is fixed, let's file bugs in the MozDev bug database
under the "Trunk Building" component that I have up there. I don't want to cause
confusion.

Also, if anyone has some time, try and checkout a tree and verify this bug. I'm
going to check one out too, but I want to make sure it works on a system other
than mine.
Jeff, ignore everything that I said in comment #1 :). It appears that it'll be
awhile before we have our own component and we need r= from Bugzilla.
