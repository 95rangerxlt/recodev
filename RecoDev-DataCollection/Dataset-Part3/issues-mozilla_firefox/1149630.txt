Especially in the dark theme, the FPS graph looks very different to everything else, aesthetically speaking.

Instead of the current blue, you could use --theme-selection-background for both themes.

Perf graphs now use the same base graph, can style them by color. The tooltips still need to be redesigned but there's another bug for that.

Same thing, the colors are horrible imho. Hoping the other bug will make them better.

Fixed for both?
Yeah, colors are bad. bgrins is landing bug 947242 that make it way pretty, but we will be tweeking it over the course of Fx40 (colors good for inspector text are probably not going to be the same as what will look good in a graph).

Regarding tooltip config, I think bug 1149626 will involve more styling, so will take care of it there if it makes sense one way or another to anchor the tooltips or what
