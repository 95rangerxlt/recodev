This test has been timing out frequently since the fix for bug 932322 landed, even with the increased timeout limit.

I'm disabling it not for Linux, and it needs to be fixed and reenabled.

Now with actually disabling the correct test!
msucan: this is the test I pinged you about before. It's timing out because window has many more properties now, we tried upping the timeout but it keeps timing out. The test should really be rewritten so that it doesn't keep getting slower when we add properties to window.

reopen, since the disabling landed on m-c not the fix and enabling

Don't forget [leave open] when disabling tests :-)
Peter, is there any chance that the perf regressions caused by bug 932322 are ultimately what made this test so much slower too?

It's unlikely, the regression is related to 1 specific property, window.document. We added about 100 properties.

The timeout was caused by variables view taking a lot of time to show the |window| properties on linux in debug builds.

I changed the iterators and generators test file to put the new properties on a container object of their own, so we don't have to open vview for |window|. Hopefully this will avoid timeouts.

No try push yet, due to TREE CLOSED.
