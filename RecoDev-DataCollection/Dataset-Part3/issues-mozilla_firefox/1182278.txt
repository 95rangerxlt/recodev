Luckily, our code doesn't actually trigger this behavior, but perhaps some addon that uses the tree's source-map lib does.

Update the tree's copy of the mozilla/source-map library to 0.4.4

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Bug 1166048
[User impact if declined]: Minimal, possibly broken addons.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Two new test cases for the regressions.
[Risks and why]: Bug 1166048 fixed some bugs but then some npm modules that also use the source-map lib found regressions. AFAICT, we don't ever trigger those regressions in the library, but this patch fixes them anyhow.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

New upstream version, has good test coverage, taking it to aurora.
