Sometime when I switch between certain other programs such as AOL, when I try to
click and type inside a form on Mozilla, the cursor does not appear. I have to
refresh the page for the cursor to appear in the fill in.

Reproducible: Sometimes

without having to refresh the page.

Sam, the bug blocking this one (bug 186075) was resolved. Can you please check
with a current nightly build and a fresh profile, if this also fixes this bug.
Thank you.
