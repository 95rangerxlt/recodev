'Save As' does NOT work.

Why has this been marked aviary-landing?
my bad, it's not an avary-landing.

From the JavaScript console:
Error: makeURI is not defined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/pageInfo.js
Line: 683

should be makeURL. This is a typo in Daniel Brooks's path <http://tinyurl.com/4cztv>
Actually, not a typo in that patch, but the differences between Firefox and
Seamonkey.

And by the way, saveURL in Firefox accepts 6 args instead of seamonkey's 5.

Ah, but you wanted rs=me for xpfe right? ;-)
any chance it'll get in the trunk soon? the patch has been superreviewed already
Mathieu: true, but the tree only just opened

anyway, I just checked it in
thanks, was "refreshing" the bug ;)
assuming this is the bug corresponding to your Feb 4, 2005 checkin to the 1.7
branch (although patch doesn't match exactly and reviewers aren't marked).

Please include the bug number in your check-in comments.
my comments should have gone in bug 239472. Thanks for setting me straight, f.qu 

And the rest of you, see why bug numbers in checkin comments are a good idea? ;-)
