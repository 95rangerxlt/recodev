As part of changing the in-development names for Firefox 1.8 branch and trunk builds (see bug 308973), we'll need new graphics for the "About" page with the new names.

I can take this - can someone outline exactly what wording is needed?

current about graphic for trunk/branch branding
I've attached some screenshots of the current branding graphics.

for 1_8_BRANCH ...
  - globe w/o Firefox
  - name "Bon Echo" in Mozilla font

for TRUNK ...
  - globe w/o Firefox
  - name "Minefield" in Mozilla font

Priority is for the Bon Echo one, as it's needed to push Firefox 2 Alpha 1

I'm happy to use this, assuming it's sufficient resolution anti-aliasing that meets with our branding guidelines, etc.
Er, we have unofficial branding guidelines?  This was created by Asa via the same process as the Deer Park graphic was created, figured that's good enough for non-official ugly graphics!

Looks good to me.

Surely the globe should be replaced by a mine!

Proposed Minefield About dialog image

Potentially offensive militaristic version - preferred by beltzner (and myself)  :-)

Plain version of the Minefield About dialog graphic

A boring (and less offensive) version.

Looks good to me. Though the second file you attached is the same ;)

Plain version of the Minefield About dialog graphic

Oops, uploaded the same file twice...
My vote goes for the more "graphic" version.  ;)
Marking as FIXED - if there's any objection to the fun minefield.png, just use minefield-boring.png
