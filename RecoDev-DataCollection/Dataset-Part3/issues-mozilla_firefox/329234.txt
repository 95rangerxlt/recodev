I can confirm the crash with 1.5.0.1, but both 1.5 and the nearly-final 1.5.0.2 work fine (tested on windows). My crash (TB15889332) shows we crash in js_LookupPropertyWithFlags. We did fix a lot of javascript crashes for 1.5.0.2 but I can't pinpoint a specific fix.

Can you confirm that current builds fix your problem?

I can confirm that 1.5.0.2 has no problems with that. Thanks.
