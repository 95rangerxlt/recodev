Patch v.1

Followup to bug 421595. Changes in /toolkit to use the new APNG throbbers.

* Does not delete old throbber packaging, since mailnewscalendar are still using Throbber-small.gif.
* Does not change /toolkit/crashreporter usage, since I assume that doesn't support APNG.
* Fixes uses of "loading_16.gif" in Pinstripe, which is no longer packaged and thus broken.

[The changes to /toolkit/themes/pinstripe/* are no longer needed, since they were done in bug 428764.]
Will GTK and Windows have a different throbber? If so you'll need to provide an override in jar.mn for the throbber in Gnomestripe and you'll also need to provide new files that Gnomestripe doesn't have to override Winstripe's (extensions/update.css and update/update.css in mozapps)
Actually, if the throbbers will be at the same relative locations you don't need those new CSS files, just a jar.mn change.
All 3 themes already have their own throbbers packaged, and all are chrome://global/skin/icons/loading_16.png [There's even a Vista Aero specific one, although currently it's just a duplicate of the non-Aero version.]

This bug is about changing usage of the old throbber chrome:// URIs to the new one. The old throbbers are still packaged, because I didn't want to break extensions that might be using them so late.
Oh I see, its in icons/ now. I was looking at throbber/.
