I spotted some console errors while using the add-on debugger. Digging I found that some of the code I added in bug 990074 was broken, attempting to use a window.location as an nsIURI. But tests are still passing. I had added the code to listen for windows through the observer service because I was sure that I couldn't get the window URI when we got notified through onNewGlobal yet it turns out that we do so either the platform changed or I just made a mistake.

Either way the other code is redundant and broken so we should get rid of it.
