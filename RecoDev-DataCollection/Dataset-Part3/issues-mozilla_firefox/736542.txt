Backing out the patch from bug 727637 does restore the expected behavior.
Tracking for FF13. Given https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=727637#c3, it sounds like we should just do the backout.

This undoes bug 727637. Once this lands, I'll re-open bug 727637.
Any idea why that patch broke this?

Oh, yes - it moved code using |this| into a callback function, so |this| isn't what it expects it to be. Easy fix, but I figured backout was still the safe option for Aurora.
