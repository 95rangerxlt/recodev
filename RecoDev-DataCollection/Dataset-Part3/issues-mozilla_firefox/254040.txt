When typing a word WITHOUT spaces in to the address bar to find a page to do a
google search for the first link firefox goes to the page but does not display
the url it instead displays the google search.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in "ebgames" in the addres bar leaving the.com out. 
2. the page will load but the correct address will not show unless you refresh
the page. 


Actual Results:  
The site http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/default.asp will load but only "ebgames"
(witout the quotes" will show in the address bar.

other examples include: "ign" "mozillafirefox" "slashdot" or any other word
without spaces.

Expected Results:  
The software should display the full address and not the word typed into the
address bar.

This works on a fresh profile with no extensions or themes.  Branch/zip.

This could be used to trick users so it could be a security problem but is not
something that could be exploited easily.

Screen shot of the problem.
Does not occur on 20040722 build, so may in fact be related to
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231393 checkins as mentioned in the
forums, which were made on 7/23.
Confirmed on 20040801 aviary on the Mac. Confirming and setting hardware and OS
to All.
This also affects other URL fixups.

Typing "http://test"  loads test.com. Potential security issue if you consider
users trying e.g. http://intranet when their company's DNS server is muxed.
confirming Linux - Fx 0.9 branch 20040807

Clear user typed value for keyword loads

How about something like this?

p.s. The change is in both browser.js and tabbrowser.xml because the
progresslistener in tabbrowser.xml is only used when the browser is in tabbed
mode and the progresslistener in browser.js is not (easily) tab aware.
-> pch for a look at this patch

Very disconcerting screenshot :o)

Well due to google pagerang of MS site, and due to the results of "http"
search, ommitting the ":" in an address can have this type of consequence.

By the way using Gecko/20040817 Firefox/0.9.1+ the bug doesn't occures each
times.	Try the "language tools" address... It displays the correct address for
me.

I don't confirm for the pretty same UA installed from scratch. It doesn't work
well. The steps to reproduce give the same and other examples too.

donno if this helps but if the search query is one word such as windowsxp, this
bug appears. but if the search query is two words, this bug will not appear.
I think this problem only appears in trunk-builds.
(I cannot reproduce it in 0.9.3 final.)

Nope. Branch as well.

It is not a duplicate: see 261965.
pch, had any time to look at this or ideas on how to fix.  I think we need to
get this soon if it is going to make it for 1.0
It has been working for me in some instances in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows
NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10. However I don't recall how I got
them to work.

Clear user typed value for keyword loads

I use "browse by name" as my keyword URL instead of "i'm feeling lucky".  The
URL is correct if I type "ebgames" but not if I type "foo".  Maybe the patch
assumes the keyword URL will result in a redirect.

This patch just fixes the regression from the patch in Bug 231393. I think the
behaviour you're seeing existed before the patch from that bug (I tried in
Firebird 0.6 and it seems to act the same way as recent nightlies do). Can you
confirm that the current behaviour is the same as the pre-"Bug 231393 patch"
behaviour?

I don't know if there is another bug dealing with the keyword:<keyword> issue or
not (assuming the regression really is fixed).

I didn't find one, so I filed bug 264830.
Don't see this bug in trunk, status: FIXED?
Yes, this looks to be fixed in the aviary landing.  Reopen if you see something
that clearly wasn't fixed when the aviary branch was landed.

(tested using the Linux 20041216 nightly)
