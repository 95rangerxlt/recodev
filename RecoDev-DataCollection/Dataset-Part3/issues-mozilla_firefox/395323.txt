"web site" should be "website" in larry text?

C:\builds\trunk\mozilla\browser\locales\en-US\chrome\browser\browser.dtd(354)

<!ENTITY identity.moreInfoLinkText "Tell me more about this web site...">

I think we use "website" not "web site", but we mix it up.

Is website a word in the English language?
nelson, good question.

http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/website?view=uk

it appears so.

but from http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/W0075725.html

The transition from World Wide Web site to Web site to website seems to have progressed as rapidly as the technology itself. The development of website as a single uncapitalized word mirrors the development of other technological expressions which have tended to evolve into unhyphenated forms as they become more familiar. Thus email has recently been gaining ground over the forms E-mail and e-mail, especially in texts that are more technologically oriented. Similarly, there has been an increasing preference for closed forms like homepage, online,  and printout.
Perhaps we should fix:

Sigh.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website#Spelling

If I remember correctly, Red Hat's style guide says
to use "website" and "web page".

"Identity UI Internal Consistency" patch

It would be nice if en-US was at least consistent, (and then en-GB could do otherwise, for instance) but it's hard to argue persuasively for a change either way, based on both lack of en-US "authority" consensus, and the lack of consistency in our own code.  

However, we also really can't leave things as is, because (embarassingly) everything in the Larry popup and the security page of page info to which it links uses two 2-word version *except 2 places*:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.properties#107

and

http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/pageInfo.dtd#115

Not contradicting ourselves on the same page of text seems like priority 1 here. :)

Seth, my proposal to you would be that we land this patch "fixing" the two wayward strings so that the identity UI is at least self-consistent, and then if you are so inclined, you open a separate bug to address the overall inconsistency in an effort to try and nail down something either way.
Johnathan, that sounds like a reasonable plan.

Notice also that in some parts of the pref ui, we use "site" (instead of "website" or "web site").
Also don't forget:
identity.domainverified.supplemental=Information identifying the owner of this site may not have been validated.

"site" should be "web site" if we are going with two words

Fix third instance

Per michael's suggestion, this also "fixes" site->web site.
Fixed by the most recent check-in of bug 383183.
