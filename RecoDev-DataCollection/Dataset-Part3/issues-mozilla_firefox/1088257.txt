+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1084419 +++

The share button uses social-share-button.label as the tooltip and social-share-button.tooltiptext as the label. This makes no sense.

We should remove the label and tooltiptext properties here, because they should be picked up automatically based on the id:

This is the updated file with the unnecessary lines (398, 399) of code removed.

This is the modified file that does not have the label or tooltip properties for the share button. I was not sure if this was a patch or what.

You need to create the patch using "hg diff", e.g. "hg diff > ~/mypatch.diff". You can read more about it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_diff_and_patch_files.3F

Before you create the patch, make sure Mercurial is set up properly:

Please feel free to just attach a patch, we'll then formally assign the bug to you.
This looks like fixed. I don't see the tooltip and label properties.

They're still there as far as I can tell.

Fix patch

Fixed with this patch. My first one so hoping I did correctly :)

Fix patch

Looks good, but this patch is using DOS line endings (\r\n) rather than Unix line endings (\n), which prevents it from applying cleanly. I'm not sure how this happened. Do you think you can fix it?
This is probably because I made it on ubuntu and transfered it to windows before submitting it. I'm going to fix that and work solely from the VM.

Looks good, thanks!
Is there any test to produce or run ? What are the next steps ?

Unless your patch causes unexpected problems, we're done here and the fix will appear in one of the next nightly builds.
