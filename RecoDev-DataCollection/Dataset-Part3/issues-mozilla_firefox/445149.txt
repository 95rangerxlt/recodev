add telugu to the build
Builds are kicking off, the current comparison is at http://l10n.mozilla.org/buildbot/compare/linux-langpack/11290, the latest can be found via the dashboard as usual. You're having a tinderbox set up now, too, http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Mozilla-l10n-te. There are no builds there yet, just give it a few hours.

Once the builds succeed, binaries will be uploaded to http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.9.0-l10n/ which can be used for testing.
