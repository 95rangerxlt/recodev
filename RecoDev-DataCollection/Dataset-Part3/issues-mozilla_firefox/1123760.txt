They currently all expose "Location" as their name to MSAA consumers. I bet this is fixable if we just give go/stop/reload appropriate aria-label attributes that mirror their tooltip contents, and add new strings for the identity block and the location bar dropdown icon.

This will also need to cover the focusable notification icons in the icon-box in the location bar...

Does the identity notification icon not need an accessible label?

::: browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd:206
(Diff revision 1)
> +<!ENTITY urlbar.webRTCShareDevicesNotificationAnchor.label      "Manage sharing your camera with the site">

The notification shows a camera icon, but the reason why it's called "Devices" rather than "Camera" is that when both a camera and a microphone are shared, we show this icon. The label displayed inside the notification is adapted to explain whether only a camera, or a camera + a microphone is currently shared.

I'm not sure if we should bother adapting the accessible label based on the exact situation, or if we can just try to find a better wording implying that a microphone 'may' also be shared.

"the service install message" doesn't make much sense to me, so I'm afraid it may also be confusing to users, and may get even more confusing once translated by a localizer that may not understand it better than I do.

It's only used for persona auth, (hidden) preffed off by default, and considering our current (lack of) commitment to persona I expect it'll disappear from the tree. Doesn't seem worth it.

Can you suggest a better generic wording?

The popups themselves use "Service" as a descriptor. I don't think we should use different terminology. Can you suggest better wording?

Fair enough. Maybe we should have a comment saying that it's preff'ed off, so that the next person looking at the code doesn't wonder the same thing?

We agreed on IRC for:
Manage sharing your camera and/or microphone with the site

This comment also applied to the 'You are sharing your camera with the site' string that should also say camera and/or microphone.

Given that this is consistent with the other add-on and app install messages you have, I withdraw this comment.

This looks good for all the buttons we provide, but if an add-on adds itself into the tool bar items, these buttons get a label of "Location" as they did before.

So I am wondering if, since they provide tooltip text anyway, we could make this easier and try to assign the aria-label the same content even for add-ons?

That sounds like a question for Surkov? Firefox frontend code can't "intercept" the icons add-ons add and modify their attributes, because they just use XUL overlays or manually append stuff - we do not get told when this happens. I'm also not sure how many of these icons have tooltips - our own icons (at least the ones next to the identity box) often don't. If you mean the type of icons at the end of the bar, like stop/go/reload, then I guess those do often have tooltips and so the a11y code could do that. I can file a followup for this.

Ah OK! Thought if they were using the Jetpack method, we could intercept those. I was using something similar with the Tenon.io extension I wrote and thought this might be straight-forward. Yeah a follow-up bug might be nice, although with all this being in flux anyway, we might want to wait on fixing it until we have a new proper mechanism in place that no longer relies on XUL overlays. :)

Changing to f+ given your reply.

I remembered / would have expected that it was already the case that a11y could would fall back on using the tooltip as the accessible label when there's no (aria-)label set. Is this not the case?

We should fix that by setting tooltips where they're missing. They're useful for sighted users too.

Have you filed that bug yet?

There is a label on the location bar, so that is used instead.

I'm not sure I agree - the interaction between the panel and the tooltip seems like it would be likely to be poor.

Thanks for reminding me. I filed bug 1216478.

This doesn't really make sense, though (as demonstrated by this bug).

Then we should get that fixed too. We already set tooltips on various other popup anchors (e.g. toolbar buttons on the navigation toolbar).

Sure, I wasn't saying it was working *well*, but simply explaining what happens right now. :-)
