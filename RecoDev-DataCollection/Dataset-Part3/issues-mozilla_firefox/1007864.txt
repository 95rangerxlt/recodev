Work is currently underway to improve the history sidebar (Bug 989102). Because there is new visual styling, the same changes will need to be applied to the Bookmarks sidebar for UI consistency.

Updated Bookmark Styling

Updated styling applied to Bookmarks sidebar.
The mockups look nice (both this one and the history one) except that the search field could use the Chameleon styling or at least have square corners on Windows.
Hi Sevaan, can you provide a point value for this bug.

Thanks for pointing that out. I'm going to submit a bug for a visual review of these sidebars by MMaslaney.
