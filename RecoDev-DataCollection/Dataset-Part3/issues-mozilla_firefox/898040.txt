We shouldn't need to run PanelUI.init until the panel is activated.
We still need the lazy getters, but the event listeners aren't needed and it looks like the retrieval of the panel element is causing the panel constructor to be run.

I confirmed locally that the PanelUI.xml binding constructor isn't being run with this patch and that the panel opens and functions correctly.

It's a little ugly that we have to run _ensureEventListenersAdded at the start of each of those functions, but I'll take performant code over pretty code at this point.

I guess we should add a 

_initialized: false,

 somewhere here as well.

And I guess we don't need to remove these if !this._eventListenersAdded.
Oh, I forgot to remove the _initialized business. It's not needed anymore.

I forgot to add a check in uninit to only remove the event listeners if they were added. Without this check, the PanelUI.xml cstor will run when a window is closed.

Landed the follow-up on UX, https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/91c9b0675e2b
Is adding event listeners for begin/end batch updates & showHelpView really needed? For the former, I don't think we need the listeners to be there. For the latter, that can't really be called without the panel having been opened before... right?
I was added them as defensive programming in case they become needed in the future, but we can remove them if you feel strongly about it.
