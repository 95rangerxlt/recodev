Joe - this is late-breaking, but would like to see the change uplifted to at least dev edition ( to catch 38 ) and we should consider uplift to beta 37 to capture at least some of the 37 beta cycle.
This is just a pref change, FWIW
Shouldn't the URL be https?

Assuming https, I can't think of any reason to prefer http, and many to prefer https
Thanks for the quick patch Jordan.
So uplifts for Fx37 and Fx38?
