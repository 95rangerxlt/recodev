I'm trying to run Firefox 4 RC 2 on a minimal install of Debian Squeeze. It looks like a new/undocumented dependency was introduced some time since beta 10:

  finn@qa1:/iad/qa/firefox-4.0rc2$ DISPLAY=:2 ./firefox
  ./firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libdbus-glib-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I found this old bug report which seems to describe the exact same issue:

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448375

Some further investigation confirms that it's a dependency of libxul.so:

 finn@qa1:/iad/qa/firefox-4.0rc2$ ldd libxul.so 2>/dev/null | grep libdbus-glib
               libdbus-glib-1.so.2 => not found

And then a huge hack confirms that it's not a "real" dependency (note I'm symlinking libdbus, not libdbus-glib):

  finn@qa1:/iad/qa/firefox-4.0rc2$ ln -s /lib/libdbus-1.so.3.4.0 libdbus-glib-1.so.2
  finn@qa1:/iad/qa/firefox-4.0rc2$ DISPLAY=:2 ./firefox
  Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display ":2.0".
  ^C
  finn@qa1:/iad/qa/firefox-4.0rc2$

i.e. it at least launches successfully with the "fake" lib in place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run RC2 on a machine without libdbus-glib 

Actual Results:  
  ./firefox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libdbus-glib-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


Expected Results:  
Firefox launches successfully.

Do we care anymore? I have no idea.
Mmmmm I thought I had fixed this a while ago.
Err, yes I had, in bug 448375, which jari linked.

Don't depend on libdbus-glib when not necessary

Fix should be as easy as this. This might be something we want for 4.0.1

I agree with glandium, we should consider taking this in 4.0.1.
If this is something you want to keep fixed, you should figure out a unit test for it. (Even something in "make check" using ldd would probably do it.)
On the long run, I think we should just use -Wl,--as-needed, which would get rid of it even if it is in the build rules.

I backed this out because it was part of a push that caused bug 644790, and out of an abundance of caution (and a desire to get bug 644790 working again before we get to sleep), I backed the whole push out.  (It was two tiny patches, of which this was one, and then the likely culprit in a series of five patches that may have had to be backed out all together.)

Approved for the mozilla2.0 repository, a=dveditz for release-drivers
Transplanted from mozilla-central onto releases/mozilla2.0:

  http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-2.0/rev/967fd562304a
I'm testing new translation in aurora, and my OS is Ubuntu Linux x64. I'm getting this error for last few releases:

$ ./firefox -p translation -no-remote -Wl
XPCOMGlueLoad error for file /path/to/unzip/firefox/libxul.so:
libdbus-glib-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Couldn't load XPCOM.

But x32 version works good. Do anybody know why in x64 system x64 version of firefox not works?
