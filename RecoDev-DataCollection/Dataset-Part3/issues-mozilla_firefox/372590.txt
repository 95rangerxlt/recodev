I have similar symptoms but it is not limited to google pages.  It occurs on all pages and with 1-3 tabs open.  (I haven't tried any more than 3.) I also am using an Nvidia 256 card.  My tabs do load completely but the screen is difficult to read because of the jiggle.  Am using Vista Home premium and a Core 2 Duo 6300 system from Dell.

Just installed a new Theme: Metal Lion - vista 1.5 and the jumping "jiggle" is gone. I was using the "default" theme previously... So of course I tried the solution with one more theme but I get the "jiggle" also.

So... all I can say is that with the aforementioned theme I have no more problems.

Metal Lion 1.5 Vista worked on my system.  Would like work to continue so I can use any theme but this may provide some insight into the issue.  

Thanks to Gal Nitzan.

Can you give steps to reproduce for the jiggle for I don't see it. I loaded 3 Google search results in new tabs but it makes no move at all. Dupe of Bug 247116?
All I have to do is load firefox and I get the jiggle on all screens in all tabs using all pages/sites except when using the Metal Lion theme and then the screen is very stable in all tabs and all pages.  I think it may have to do with Windows Vista (I am using Home Premium) and the Nvidia drivers.  I am also using a Core 2 Duo E6300 processor.  Let me know what other configuration information you would like to have and I will provide it.

For some reason, I thought this was fixed on the branch.
as ispiked pointed out in bug #384191:  see bug #178884
not blocking 1.8.1.5, but I imagine if we had a low risk work around, we would consider it.
I also have giggling when opening first address. Afterwards, other pages are okay
This is wanted, but not a blocker, as the STR aren't really a common path (the bookmark toolbar needs to be present-but-empty).
dave, did your patch for bug #247116 fix this?
Bug 247116 went in for Firefox 2.0.0.4 so if it's still being seen on branch firefox then I imagine not. However I do not have Vista handy to be able to try to reproduce this.
Dave, sorry for the confusion.  To clarify, I meant:

Did your port of the fix in #247116 to mozilla/browser/components/places/content/toolbar.xml (patch at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=269862) happen to fix bug #384191 (marked as dup of this bug) for Trunk Vista?

The original report in this bug was for fx 2002, but this bug seems to now cover trunk/vista.

swon (since you can see it), can you confirm the fix for trunk/vista?
Just tried it on Vista.
1. Started a new profile.
2. Removed all items in bookmarks toolbar.

Result before: Content window starts jumping around.
Result now: Toolbar quickly resizes by a few pixels, and no more bouncing.

So, I guess this might have fixed it Seth.
Based on steve's comments, marking as fixed for A6.  

(Credit going to Dave Townsend.)
Ok confusing, yeah my patch is quite likely to have cleaned up an issue with an empty places toolbar causing bouncing. However I'm somewhat surprised that a bug on trunk with the places toolbar was duped to one on branch with the normal toolbar.
I guess this is my fault. I thought this bug tracked the shaking issue on Vista, which I thought might've been perturbed by something specific to how we do theming in Vista, but apparently it was just due to the fix not being ported over to Places yet (in the bugs I duped to this, at least). Sorry.
