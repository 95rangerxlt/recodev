Do you have any extensions enabled?  Does the behavior reproduce on every site?
Blocking for now, but odd that we can't reproduce. What's the locale that you're using, aaravind? Could this be an l10n merge issue?
I couldn't repro this with any of en-GB, en-US, and en-ZA, using the 64-bit Linux RC builds.  Though en-ZA is missing its start page...
We had a softblocker about this happening intermittently, but We neve found steps to reproduce it. The intermittent problem started about when the popup got the arrow style.

Can you point me to the changeset in question so that I can start some guesswork on why this might be happening?
The changeset was http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/62d5d8bc0ac8 (5 Dec), note that we are not sure if it's related, I only know we got the first reports after that change.  So if you're looking for a real regression window, there is none. Related bugs are bug 617956 and bug 619532 that have been filed around 10 Dec (about the same dates I saw this locally, but I reproduced only 2 times from then).
I've seen 2 live cases of this, in one case just opening a new window fixed the problem (bad state in the browser helper that manages the panel probably. I supposed a out-of-sync ._batching property), in the other case restarting the browser was the only way to fix the problem.
I've got this bug once in 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110216 Firefox/4.0b12pre
(Built from http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b4aa47ca42c1).
Opening a new window did not help, I had to restart Firefox.

I didn't see any errors in the error console. (Though it was some time after browser start when this happened, so if there was an error right after start up, I probably missed it.)

(I initially planned to report this bug sooner, but school had priority)

I don't think the change to the arrow style is the cause of this bug, but it might make this bug happen more often.

I've got this bug once before the arrow style landed, back in 2009, in:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1pre)
Gecko/20090620 Shiretoko/3.5pre
=> Bug 499561
Not able to reproduce the issue anymore on the same system.But i reported this initially after checking 3-4 times in new profiles. Later when i tried to reproduce this, i'am not able to see this issue anymore.
I encounter this every time.

maggot, which add-on do you have?
I have the following add-ons:

Adblock Plus
Ctrl+Tab
Delicious(its "hacked" so I can use it)
Diigo Toolbar
Download Statusbar
Fast Dial
forcastfox
noscript
library detector
firebug
web developer toolbar

I did manage to try this on a 32-bit OS and that bug didn't show-up, but any 64-bit system I use it does. I only have 1 32-bit os installed(my laptop), everything else is 64-bit.

the add-ons are more or less installed on each machine i use.

hope this was of help.
something of interest, I also now notice this on Ubuntu x64 with Firefox 3.5

seems to be an issue with 64-bit systems.

same problem, 12.0beta, Mac

This is old, and I never used to see it before, but I've got it now on my Mac with Firefox 12.0 (not sure which beta exactly).  The screen shot is of Google+ but it happens on any website.

Actually, it's possible (or even almost certain), all recent reproductions of this bug are just due to bug 725784.  We workarounded that in bug 726440.

no, a simple userChrome tweak can be used though.

Do you think we can/should fix this in a similar way or just wait for bug 725784?
(The above question might not make sense. I'm actually not totally sure what is going on here. :P )

We're planning to move the bookmark star outside of the URL bar. At that point, you'll be able to remove it via toolbar customization. https://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/files/australis-designSpecs/australis-designSpecs-windows7-mainWindow.html

Don't understand the similar way thing, bug 726440 already workarounded this bug, just in Firefox 13 though.  May still be visible in any previous version. Fixing the xbl bug would clearly be better more generally.

Ah, shouldn't we mark this as RESOLVED FIXED, depending on bug 726440, and [fixed-in-bug-726440] ?
It's misleading to leave it open, if this specific issue is fixed in mozilla-central.
If you want to revert the workaround once the XBL bug is fixed, then we should file a "Revert bookmark label workaround" bug that depends on the XBL bug.

Thanks for fixing bug 726440, btw. :)
yeah, probably better.  No I don't want to revert the workaround, cause after the change in XBL, it is effectively avoiding useless work (before, replacing a node with itself was a no-op, that's no more true), so it's actually not just a workaround but also a valid fix.
