If I view an email through FireFox on my Hotmail account, typically the button
that deletes the email doesn't work. Instead of deleting the email and loading
the next one in line, it only goes the start of the page (as if you'd have
pressed the "Home" key). 

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Hotmail using Firefox
2. open email
3. click delete

Actual Results:  
Went up to the start of the page

Expected Results:  
deleted the email and loaded up the next.

occurs with both the default and the noia xtreme theme.

Clicking on the Delete button on the toolbar works as expected for me.

Pressing the Delete Key on the keyboard, dose not work, but it dosen't work in
IE either.

Do you have javascript enabled. The delete button looks like this <a href="#"
onclick="...">. Click on this, would behave as you descriibed, if you have
javascript disabled.
Sorry, I should've been more specific. When I click the large button that says
delete and it has a cross next to the word, it works. However, I was talking
about the smaller button, which only has a cross, next to the buttons for next
and previous message. THAT delete button doesn't work properly ;)
That button also WFM.

Can you do the following for me:

1. Try click on that button.
2. Open the "JavaScript Console" under the "Tools" menu, and see if there are
any errors there.

Reporter: are you still having a problem with this in a nightly build?
I just downloaded the nightly build and tried - it seems to work now. I guess
the bug can be listed as fixed now.
