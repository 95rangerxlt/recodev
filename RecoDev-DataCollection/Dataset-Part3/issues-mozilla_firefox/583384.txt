There are at least a few cases that I'm just going to do in a followup to land sooner rather than later. I'm trying to mark all code locations with XXXzpao and a mention of this bug.

Pretty sure all of these cases were converted to classes in the final landing. Not to mention that it's all obsolete now after the wizard revamp removed most of the images.
