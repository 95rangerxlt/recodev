See bug 811935 for ESR 17. We landed http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr17/rev/38a4cff47f5c then. Same again ? 

RelMan is on the hook for this like bug 914114, I think.

I've pushed the wordmark from mozilla-esr17 but it is a png and not svg so here's hoping it works still http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr24/rev/967211a1ca0a
more completely covered the s/svg/png swaps: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr24/rev/a26e0662d335

I pushed the changes to try:
  https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=817782f70121

This is a screen shot from the mac build, which seems fine to me. We can ignore the 'You are currently on the default update channel', that's just the try server.
resolved fixed?
lgtm
