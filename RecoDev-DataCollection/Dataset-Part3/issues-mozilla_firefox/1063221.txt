I could not replicate this bug. The Search X addon works for me with E10S enabled. I am able to highlight text and right click, giving me the search submenu. Do you have a screenshot to demonstrate this bug?
alreiten, can you still reproduce this problem? A number of Firefox bugs have been fixed that should improve add-on compatibility.

For others, here's a link to the addon on AMO:

I tried testing this again, with another new profile, but the add-on submenu in the context menu is still not showing up for me.  See attachment.
limweizhong, are you the developer of the "Content Search X" add-on? This add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
The developer has been contacted through AMO.
I think the issue is that I have a custom function getBrowserSelection that does not limit the length of the selected text. I see that the official getBrowserSelection now uses a function getFocusSync from BrowserUtils.jsm. How do I include that file, and what actually does this line do: "elt.syncHandler.getFocusedElementAndWindow()"?
The new version of the add-on attempts to solve the compatibility issue. Please help to verify this. Thank you.
alreiten: can you please test whether the latest Context Search X addon (version 0.4.6.18 on AMO) works for you with e10s?
Tested on Nightly and it works correctly.
