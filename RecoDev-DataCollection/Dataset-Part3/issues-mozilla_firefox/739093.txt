It's useless.
Was it ever useful? Some more context here would be nice.
It wasn't ever useful. Its only purpose is to push the fullscreen window controls to the end in case there are no other flexible elements on the toolbar.
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=11855321#p11855321 motivated me to do this. As it happens, I've seen the back/forward buttons fail to connect with the location bar for no apparent reason on my aunt's computer two days ago. Resetting the toolbars fixed it.
I should probably remove "#TabsToolbar > " here: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/3e4735893504/browser/themes/winstripe/browser.css#l1151

Is removing this from the code correct? Even though fullscreenflex is going away, the purpose of this is to remove "fullscreenflex" from currentset when going from UI version 2 to 3, so if someone is on that upgrade path the code should still remove it.

Additionally, should we upgrade the UI version with this change to remove it again? FTR I have fullscreenflex in my currentset

The purpose of this code isn't to remove fullscreenflex but to add bookmarks-menu-button-container.

It doesn't hurt to have it in the currentset, toolbars handle non-existing ids just fine.

Oh that's true, that was not meant to remove fullscreenflex but to add the bookmarks menu. currentset will also get cleared up after any customization so that shouldn't be a worry.

And yeah we can remove #TabsToolbar > #window-controls
There's only this addon on AMO that relies on this element: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bug582139/?src=ss
So giving a heads up to Alice.

I'd like to land this fairly simple patch (mostly code removal) on Aurora for bug 739160. The feature being broken was new in Firefox 10.

Could they not land this fix on Fx 12 beta also? If not, What would be the ramifications if they did?

Theoretically, yes. Don't know what the chances are to get it approved.

[Triage Comment]
Regression in Firefox 10 - approving for Aurora 13. I'm concerned that there's too little time left in Beta 12 to confidently determine that there is no add-on compatibility fallout (esp. outside of AMO). For that reason, let's let this land in FF13 first.
