This could be IMHO localizable by adding appropriate prefs into firefox-l10n.js and I surely want to substitute the english services with our local ones.
firefox-l10n.js sounds like the least favorable position for critical l10n content, from a trademarks and QA perspective.
Just so we're totally clear -- because earlier comments say "may" and "could" -- we definitely want the feed services to be localizable for Firefox 2.

As far as I know, everyone is in agreement that this fix should go into beta2; speak now if you dissent!
I'm collecting the Japanese market services.

Uses localizable strings for service names and URIs, also updates the name of the Google services to the correct production names.
Is the number of three feeds per locale given? Could they add more, or drop one?

I'm curious about those
pref("browser.contentHandlers.types.2.type", "application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed");
is it a good idea to hardcode those in firefox.js, or would it make sense to fallback to "application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed" if that's not given at all?

One nit, the XXBen comment should probably go as part of fixing this bug.

Three is not a firm limit.  If there aren't three that make sense for a given locale, then having fewer seems reasonable.  If there are four or five that have a legitimate strong presence in that market, then they shouldn't hesitate to submit them for approval.
The type is necessary because the system that handles web service registration for content types is not specific in any way to feeds, feeds just happens to be the first consumer of its data.

Nit: this second comment isn't needed anymore.  (Does the first still apply?)

r=me with inapplicable comments nixed.
Pam- question for the Japan market.  Do you want the same URL or is there a google.co.jp url that we should be using for the Japan builds?
Fixed on trunk. 
Fixed on the branch. 

When this service becomes truly generic for FF3.0, the type field needs to become localizable too, and perhaps this configuration should no longer live in prefs?
Axel: Now that this has landed, can you write a quick paragraph that describes exactly what people need to do to change these values in their locale?  You can drop it right into the l10n-requirements if you want, or stick it here, or email me, whatever's easiest.

I was playing around with this a moment ago and when I added:

browser.contentHandlers.types.3.title=Startowy.com
browser.contentHandlers.types.3.uri=http://www.startowy.com/dodajrss.html?zrodlo=%s

to the region.properties, it did not show up. When I removed Yahoo and added it as ...types.2 it appeared correctly.

Then I read the patch above and now it's clear to me that .3 can't work from region.properties. 

It's not that I want more than three in my locale, though.
