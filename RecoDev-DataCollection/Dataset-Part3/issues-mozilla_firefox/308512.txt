Firefox crashes upon successful entering of your password on my schools login
course site. Error output is as follows:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Login
2. Enter username and pass
3. Click submit

Naturally it would be nice if I could give my pass for better testing, but alas
not that is not possible.

Umm, why was this bug resolved as "FIXED". No indication was made as to how this was "FIXED" and why it shouldn't just be "INVALID" / "WORKSFORME"?
Umm, because this bug does not show up with the latest release of FF. I assume as thus it was fixed somewhere down the line between the time I reported it and one of the RC's that I tested that no longer showed the problem.

Change it whatever suits the bug better, doesnt matter to me. I just wanted to get it out of rotation. Though I have not tested this on the trunk builds, the branches no longer show this behaviour...
