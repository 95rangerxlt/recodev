Hi

I installed Firefox 1.0. Searching in the google quick search worked fine for
some days. Suddently entering a text in the quick search field of google and
hittinh ENTER, resulted in absolutely nothing happening. If I choose another
quick search engine, the search actually takes place, just not with google.
After a reinstall of FF 1.0 iw works fine for some time again and then the same
thing happends again.

You need to supply more details on what changes you made before it stopped
working if you expect anyone else to be able to reproduce this bug.
Well i cannot provide more information. It simply stopped woking!

As said;

The problem didnt arise with the FF 1.0 PR.

Im sorry but what can i tell more, it just stopped working. But if im the only
one having this bug - forget about it.

Thanks and

I think its related to a cookie setting. If i delete cookies, it appears to
invoke the described problem. Further; if i choose the setting to keep cookies
until i close firefox, the cookies are still there the next time i launch
firefox, i.e this option does not work

reg Jorn
Hi

i found out what happends; some times after cjanging cookie setting in FF, the
file google-src becomes corrupt. 
Here is the content of the corrupted google.src file;

" factor="10">
<inputprev name="start" factor="10">
<input name="ie" value="utf-8">
<input name="oe" value="utf-8">

<interpret 
    browserResultType="result" 
    charset = "UTF-8"
    resultListStart="<!--a-->" 
    resultListEnd="<!--z-->" 
    resultItemStart="<!--m-->" 
    resultItemEnd="<!--n-->"
>
</search>

and here is the content of the original well functioning google-src file;

# Mozilla/Google plug-in by amitp+mozilla@google.com

<search 
   name="Google"
   description="Google Search"
   method="GET"
   action="http://www.google.com/search"
   update="http://www.google.com/mozilla/google.src"
   updateCheckDays=1   
   queryEncoding="utf-8"
   queryCharset="utf-8"
>

<input name="q" user>
<inputnext name="start" factor="10">
<inputprev name="start" factor="10">
<input name="ie" value="utf-8">
<input name="oe" value="utf-8">

<interpret 
    browserResultType="result" 
    charset = "UTF-8"
    resultListStart="<!--a-->" 
    resultListEnd="<!--z-->" 
    resultItemStart="<!--m-->" 
    resultItemEnd="<!--n-->"
>
</search>

Any idea how to resolve this bug ?

I am having this bug as well. I have not had time to troubleshoot it well, but
if I do I will post more. The problem is only with Google Search. I am using
Firefox 1.0 on a Windows XP Pro box with SP2 and a bunch of Extensions. 

Just posting so you know this is not just one incident.

My google.src file

I found this in the location below after reading the rest of the bug comments.
Looks pretty corrupt compared to other src files in the directory.

Hi Philip

in order to give this bug adequate focus, could you change status to "confirmed" ?

Thanks and best regards Jorn
Upon further examination of the corrupted file I have posted, I noted that it is
a GIF file. Changing the extension results in a valid 70x70 GIF file with
"Google Eyes" I begin to wonder if this could have been overwritten by a Theme
or Extension I have installed which was not designed properly.

I do not have time to redownload and search them all now, but I will do what I
can when I do.

Themes:

Plastikfox Crystal SVG 1.5.1
Lure 0.5.0
Littlefox

Extensions:

DomInspector
All-in-One-Gestures
NukeAnything
ChromEdit
Mouse Gestures
Tabbrowser Extensions
WeatherFox
Wikipedia
Translate
Tweak Network
Wayback
QuickNote
Print It!
FoxyTunes
BandwidthTester
FireFTP
Homeland Security Threat Level
Hi Philip

thanks, i tried to change the status to "confirmed" as well, and i submitted the
bug, but i cannot either change the status

Regards Jorn
I have seen this with Google, and also with the IMDB search engine.  The
IMDB.png file got corrupted for some reason.  I'm not sure why.  After the file
got corrupted, the image no longer shows up on the search dropdown menu. 
Pierre, what if anything is being done regarding this bug? I have seen it happen
to several people. I have been unable to trace exactly where/when the original
good .src are overwritten, but it is obviously a more widespread problem than
just a single seach engine or site overwriting them. Whatever is causing them to
be overwritten, it seems like this would qualify not only as a bug but even a
security vulnerability. If the .src can be overwritten with a image file, surely
it can be overwritten to redirect the browser maliciously.

Regardless, several other sources have confirmed this bug. Could we please get
it marked confirmed.

i've noticed this on all firefox versions from 1.0 on. i'm now using 1.0.3 and
the behavior is still exhibited. which is, the google search engine in the
search bar does not work. after entering a search term and pressing enter,
nothing happens. all of the other search engines work. i tried messing with the
cookies settings, but nothing seemed to help (cleared cookies, changed between
cookies are cleared after to closing to cookies not being cleared).

also, i have only installed the "view in internet explorer" extension. no themes.

to reproduce:

- select the google search engine in the search bar
- enter a search term (e.g. "foo")
- press enter

Google Search src replaced with this HTML

In that case, the search engine update happened while you were using the
university connection, which redirects all requests and gives you the login page
instead of google.src on the mozilla.org server. Fixing that would be rather
difficult, we'd need to improve the validation of .src files so that invalid
ones can be rejected.
Fixed by bug 327932.
