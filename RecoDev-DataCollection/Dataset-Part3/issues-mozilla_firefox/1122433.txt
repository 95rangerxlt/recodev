+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1122356 +++

Expression closures (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) are a nonstandard language extension we'd like to remove from SpiderMonkey.

In AboutHome.jsm, this only affects the snippetsVersion getter as far as I can see:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/cac6192956ab/browser/modules/AboutHome.jsm#l30

The general pattern for getters is that:

get x() y,

needs to be replaced with:

get x() {
  return y;
},

Since you're already fixing a very similar bug, I'd suggest trying something different now, like bug 1122430.

Feel free to, as long as this bug isn't assigned and nobody has attached a patch.

Looks about right, but indentation is off (and should use spaces only, no tabs) and there should be a semicolon after the return statement...

The line with the return statement should be indented with 4 spaces and } with 2 spaces. Also, please make sure your diff is against the repository head rather than on top of your previous patch.

Something went wrong here... this file is basically empty, there's no patch
The same copy of the diff file is getting generated every time I run the diff.
I suspect you've committed your changes and diff only cares about uncommitted changes. What do you get when running hg out?
