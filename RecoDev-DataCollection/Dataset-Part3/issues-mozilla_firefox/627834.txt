Looks like this is a result from bug 625257.
Talked to zpao and we think that a session save state is being triggered from a previous test, or from changing the session save interval.

Rework test to not use session save events.

With this patch, the test manually does a save state but after the tab has loaded. This is to ensure that the tab has a history.count > 0, so that a save state will create a cache.

Because we do not wait for a save state, we no longer have to change any preferences!

Comment on attachment 505985
Rework test to not use session save events.

First thing's first: we don't need the state setting or checking. The test is pretty linear now and with the listners being attached mostly as needed, then we shouldn't get into weird states.

>-// First, the newly created blank tab should trigger a save state.
>-function test_bug625257_1() {
>+function test_bug625257_1(aEvent) {

Let's call this firstOnLoad or something and rename onLoad similarly.

>+  tab.linkedBrowser.removeEventListener("load", test_bug625257_1, true);
>+
>+  let uri = aEvent.target.location;
>+  is(uri, "about:blank", "first load should be for about:blank");
>+
>+  // Trigger a save state.
>+  ss.getBrowserState();
>+
>   is(gBrowser.tabs[1], tab, "newly created tab should exist by now");
>   ok(tab.linkedBrowser.__SS_data, "newly created tab should be in save state");
> 
>   tab.linkedBrowser.loadURI(URI_TO_LOAD);
>   state = 0;
> }
> 
> let tabsListener = {
>   onLocationChange: function onLocationChange(aBrowser) {
>     gBrowser.removeTabsProgressListener(tabsListener);
>-    is(state, 0, "should be the first listener event");
>+    is(state, 0, "should occur after about:blank load");
>     state++;

Since we're getting rid of the state checks, you can just check that the currentURI is correct

> 
>     // Since we are running in the context of tabs listeners, we do not
>     // want to disrupt other tabs listeners.
>     executeSoon(function() {
>       tab.linkedBrowser.removeEventListener("load", onLoad, true);

This listener will not have been added yet so nothing to remove here.

Otherwise it looks good and takes out the dependency on the save notification.
