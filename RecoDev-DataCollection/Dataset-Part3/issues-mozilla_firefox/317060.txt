Is dictionary really expected to be in all l10ns?
The proper list to use for verification has been very confusing.  Rafael confirmed that this is not a bug.
Apparently I got confused by my own script, it had a bug on the installed
search engines, and I didn't check that closely enough.

REOPENING for:

Remove dictionary, for real.
Fix icons for Google and Amazon.co.uk, both are broken on my windows install.

I did a clean install on pruned install dir and profile dir, no migration on 
profile creation, and dictionary shows up, and google icon is broken, amazon.co.uk
has no icon. Both are no binary on CVS. yahoo isn't binary as well, but looks ok.

cvs admin -kb amazon-en-GB.png google-dk.gif yahoo-dk.gif

dictionary.com still needs to be removed.
Axel : as in removing 
  browser/searchplugins/dictionary.png 
and 
  browser/searchplugins/dictionaty.src
