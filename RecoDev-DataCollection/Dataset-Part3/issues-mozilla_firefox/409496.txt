Hi,

I have the same bug in safe mode with FF2.0.0.12 and FF3b3 (java RE 6u3 and 6u4). It is related to javascript. When JS is disabled, everything's fine. IE detects some errors but doesn't freeze or crash.

Test it: especially on this page http://www.laguitare.com/result_page.php?evt_type=SL&evt_id=0,
after about 3 or 5 minutes, firefox freezes and its process increases about 50% of my intel dual core. I have to kill process or close firefox in the taskbar.

Seems to be ok FF 3.0pre
