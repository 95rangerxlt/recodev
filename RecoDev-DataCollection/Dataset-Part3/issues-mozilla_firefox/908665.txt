... and during self-review, I realized that [sizemode="maximized"] also excluded full-screen mode, which AFAIK we need to keep excluding.

Can you put up some screenshots and get ui-review on this first, especially regarding restored windows with menubars?
I don't think this needs ui-review. The selector is obviously just broken, so we should fix that. If somebody comes up with a better design, we can consider that, but that's orthogonal to the fact that this code should no longer care about the menu bar state or whether windows are restored or maximized.

The gradient's impact is going to be very different in a context where the window isn't maximized, and/or has a menubar above it without that gradient (but *with* a native titlebar gradient, leading to something like a bottom-left-to-top-right combined gradient). It also seems from the discussion when it was originally added (bug 624292 comment 12) that it was only chosen because we didn't yet have code to extend the titlebar down the right number of pixels. I.e., it seems like it was a low-risk workaround for an issue that we would have liked to have fixed otherwise (and in fact, is now fixed). Now extending the reach of that workaround without reconsidering seems imprudent.

We're not in a rush, as it's not like the current situation has had people screaming about it. We've found issues using automated testing of various combinations, and we should work to correct the issues. Let's get UI/UX input on this and figure out what we actually want, and then get it right.

I don't really see that difference. The combined gradient exists in maximized windows as well, and I actually agree it's kind of ugly. Again, that's a matter of figuring out a better design, which can happen independently from what this bug is about.

Yes, the context has changed. The title bar now reaches down for enough, but at the same time background tabs became transparent, creating a new problem.

I'm all for reconsidering. That's why I decided to file a new bug for this patch rather than hijacking bug 907336.

I should sanity-check my stuff before submitting it...
