Build ID: 20131001024718

Steps to reproduce:

After making a change which adds a new, disabled-by-default devtools panel, browser_toolbox_window_shortcuts times out.


Actual results:

The test tries to synthesize the shortcut key for the disabled panel. Since the panel is disabled, it's never selected, and the toolbox-select event the test is expecting never gets fired.


Expected results:

The test should enable all disabled tools at the beginning of the test and disable them at the end of the test.

FYI, there's a checkin-needed bug keyword too, so you don't need to muck with the whiteboard :)
