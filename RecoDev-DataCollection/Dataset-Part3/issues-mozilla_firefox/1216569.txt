If you resize the computed view to be really small, then the "Filter Styles" text is cut off.

I think this is due to the padding-right: 23px on .devtools-rule-searchbox, which is presumably there to give room for the 'x' when it's needed: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/themes/toolbars.inc.css#379
I think this also gets bit by the weirdness in Bug 1216615, so may as well wait for that to be resolved

Brian, wasn't my intention to change the asignee of the bug (side effect of bzexport!), but I think the patch fixes this issue. Should I add you as reviewer?

Nice and simple, fixes the problem and I don't see any issue.  Can you update the commit message to say something like 'Only add right padding to rule searchbox when it is filled' and then add me as the reviewer?

We should handle RTL for this but that's another bug.
