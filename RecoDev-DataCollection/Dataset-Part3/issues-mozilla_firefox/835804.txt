Focus rectangle should have the proper styles.
I am happy help with this, but I don't entirely understand what's needed here.

Do you mean that the computed view should have the same rectangle and blue tint as occurs in the edit mode of the rules and variables views?  If so, when is this supposed to happen for the computed view?  There isn't an editing state at the moment.
Paul fixed this as part of bug 836233 so nothing further is needed.
