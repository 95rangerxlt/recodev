IsHandlerForInstallDir should use SHCTX to determine if the Registry key should be updated. It is also possible that HKLM will get updated when HKCU is set.

patch rev1

This updates the handlers for both HKCU and HKLM during install and after update.

-  ReadRegStr $6 HKCR ".hht" ""
+  ReadRegStr $6 HKCR ".xht" ""
This was a typo

-!ifdef ___WINVER__NSH___
Makes it so we require NSIS 2.22

The remainder is to make it consistent when checking string equality.
Drivers, this probably doesn't need to block 1.9.0.2 but I would very much like to land it for 1.9.0.2. This is how we update protocol / file handlers when software update runs or the installer is run on top of an existing install.
