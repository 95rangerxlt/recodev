I've opened a new tab in several fresh profiles today, and the ordering of the content seems to be inconsistent.

In particular:
 (1) The "Example Tile [SUGGESTED]" vs. "Example Tile" are sometimes shown in the wrong order. (I assume we intend to show the [SUGGESTED] one on the slide that talks about suggested content & sponsors)

 (2) One time, the "In order to provide this service, ..." slide was shown first instead of last.

Here's a screencast I captured of this ^^.
There's two onboarding experiences. One is for existing users and another for new users.

Here's a screencast of this ^^.

That's good to know & may be involved.

I'm pretty sure both of these screencasts were captured with fresh profiles, though; and I think (1) and (2) from comment 0 are both unexpected, regardless of whether the experience is targeted at a new vs. existing user.
Hmm, looks like maybe (2) may be intended actually (and is the "new user" flow).

(1) seems like a bug though (and seems to be the "existing user" flow.)  The example tiles being shown there are definitely wrong.
dcrobot, is this the correct spec: attachment 8592387

Page 18 and 19 seem to indicate the [suggested] tag should appear in the two steps of onboarding that show a tile.

It's shown on first slide for new users as in your attachment 8606418.

It's shown last for updating users as in your attachment 8606416 because we've already shown the "in order to.." message from previous onboarding.

(Notice the title/header at the top of the slide 1/3 in each video)
Yeah, it looks like issue (2) from comment 0 is actually things behaving as expected -- sorry for confusing things there. I've narrowed the scope of this bug to be about issue (1), per updated bug-summary.
This should be fixed by bug 1165386
Yup, looks like it from your screenshot of the new onboarding flows (attachment 8607182). Thanks!
