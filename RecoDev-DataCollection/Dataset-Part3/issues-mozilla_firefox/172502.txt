I don't think we want to copy the item (at least not most of them). But we
should fix the pointer to not suggest a copy. 
Chris, is it alright with you if I morph this bug into "Do not allow
ctrl+dragging or remove the + pointer". If not then I'll mark this won'tfix and
file a new bug.
Fine by me.

This patch makes DROPEFFECT_MOVE the only valid action. If you try to copy the
item by holding ctrl, you will get the "no" symbol (circle with a line through
it) and the drop won't go through. That seems to be the standard windows way of
indicating a drag-and-drop attempt is invalid. I can't find a way to make it
simply ignore the ctrl press and always act like a move without mucking with
Gecko's internals; see
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/widget/src/windows/nsNativeDragTarget.cpp#211
if you're interested in why.

This is a trivial polish fix, but it makes us more consistent which is a good
thing.
I'll look at this later tonight, almost done!

Actually, on linux it does what you want it to do (just drag with the right
icon), if it just plain doesn't work on Windows that's fine, it'll clearly tell
people trying to do it that it won't work.
fixed branch and trunk
