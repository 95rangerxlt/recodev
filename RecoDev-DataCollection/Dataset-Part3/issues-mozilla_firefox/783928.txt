Twice within the last week I have accidentally removed the Social API from my browser by accidentally selecting "Remove from Nightly" instead of "Show Sidebar" (uncheck). Doh!

I toggle the sidebar on and off *a lot* depending on how social I'm feeling. Having these two very different menu options right next to one another is pretty dangerous (for this user, at least). 

This is obviously a usability bug; feel free to triage accordingly.

Conclusion from today's meeting: let's just remove this menu item. Toggling is still possible via the Tools/App menu.
