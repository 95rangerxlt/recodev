Whenever I attempt to open a pdf file the helper program(I have tried the
default - AcroRd32.exe and Acrobat6) is loaded but the file is never opened and
the browser hangs up.  I have tried Firefox on a Windows 2000 system and did not
have this problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. find a url that has a pdf to open and try opening it
2. When it fails to open try to go back to a previous window or close the
browser window.
3. When that fails as it always does, control alt del to end the program

Actual Results:  
I have not succeeded in getting any pdf file to open after trying several sites
that have pdf files in them.

Expected Results:  
I expected the helper application to start and the pdf file to open.

Bug is fixed.  It was a software problem in my Adobe acrobat program and not in
Firefox
