Given that is it passively accumulated as a result of browsing, rather than being the product of independent actions (logging in, filling in forms, saving passwords), it should arguably be under "Browsing History" along with download history. 

This should have the expected checkbox semantics, i.e. checking browsing history should auto-check cache, unchecking browsing history should leave cache to be set or not, per user choice.

Checkbox behaviour is as expected

Move Cache under History in the CPD dialog

blah - the hierarchy there sucks - because you want to be able to control them indepedently (what if I don't want my cache cleared, but do want browsing history cleared?)

Arguably better, at that point, to just pull in Alex's overall re-org of the options here.
