The command line options -new-tab is not suppported under os2, every time you open an url from command line it will be opened in a new window.
This option is available in unix builds, should be easy to enable also for OS/2.

What happens if you call e.g.
   firefox -new-tab http://www.mozilla.org

I took a quick look in the code and for Firefox it is implemented in cross platform code (browser/components/nsBrowserContentHandler.js line 353). Does it work on Windows?

> What happens if you call e.g.

tried on two different installations, always opened a new window with the url.

>Does it work on Windows?

Yes, windows support it, just tested with ffox 2.001 and NT4.


Then this is a real bug not just an enhancement request. ;-)

I confirmed this using my own build of FF 2.0.0.1. I guess that it is related to the problem with new windows that open when calling FF from external applications, even when browser.link.open_external is set to 3 (which should open a new tab instead and is the default). That is a problem that comes up every now and then in the newsgroup.
Hmm, I am a bit confused. From what I see in the code a bare -new-tab <URL> does not seem to be supported on any platform. What should be supported, though, is the -remote functionality, i.e.
   firefox -remote openURL(http://www.mozilla.org,new-tab)
As this doesn't work on OS/2, I am just trying to debug why not...

Both are supported, cross-platform (see http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/nsBrowserContentHandler.js&rev=1.33#371).

#define BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER on OS/2, too

Thanks for the hint Gavin, must have been blind not to see that... A little bit more debugging and I found out that our z-order stuff is as broken as on Linux so we need to #define BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER (as added in bug 302281 for Unix) on OS/2, too. This patch does just that.

Then -remote() with new-tab or new-window and bare -new-tab and -new-window arguments as well as the hidden pref browser.link.open_external works as they should.

#define BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER on OS/2, too

Is there a bug filed on the OS/2 Z order code being broken, or is it the same issue as bug 156333 comment 0? Either way, it'd probably be a good idea to file a new one so that this hack can be removed someday if that ever gets fixed.
Fix checked into trunk.
Good suggestion, Gavin. I filed Bug 370134 about this issue.

#define BROKEN_WM_Z_ORDER on OS/2, too

This is a simple OS/2-only workaround. But as it is in a cross-platform file, I would like to get approval for 1.8 branch.

approved for 1.8.1.4, a=dveditz for release-drivers
Checked into branch.
(QA team: as there are no branch nightlies for OS/2 this will as usual only appear in the next release at which point I will verify.)
