This requires that
the current url is
chrome.
Say for example
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksManager.xul.
And the user clicks the bookmarklet in this
context.

<a href="javascript: var m_prefs =
Components.classes[&quot;@mozilla.org/preferences-service;1&quot;].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPrefBranch);
m_prefs.setCharPref(&quot;browser.startup.homepage&quot;,&quot;http://visuallinkindicator.mozdev.org/&quot;);">Link</a>
- change home page

Can be a problem with livemarks.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark link
2. Enter chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksManager.xul
3. Click bookmark link

Actual Results:  
Home page changed or javascript with chrome
privilege executed.

Expected Results:  
Eventhough it is a nice feature,
I think it should deny.

Skip javascript and chrome URLs in live bookmark feeds; note that this makes
the test feed show up as "live bookmark failed to load", which is what happens
when there are no valid items to load.	(Should say Empty, but too late for
that.)

Changes based on jst's feedback.  Use nsIScriptSecurityManager's CheckLoadURI
method for this instead of doing our own homegrown version.  (We need to add
deps on caps, xpconnect, and js for this though, even to call it from C++..)

a=asa for aviary checkin.
So, you are handling this only for live feeds? If so, this bug still exists, if
the user bookmarks a malice URL manually (either by "bookmark this link" or
maybe trickily putting a Javascript URL in urlbar and still having an
interesting page showing up.

Yeah, ok, Ben's right.. this can be pretty bad.  This is a gross hack; however,
every bookmarks open funnels in to here, so it's hard to decide where we're
actually at.  Any alternative suggestions welcome.
This is one of the oldest chrome-privilege-giveaway bugs we had in Seamonkey,
we've got to stop making the same mistakes all over again!

Add /chrome there...

wouldn't calling CheckLoadURI here require slightly less hardcoding of various
stuff?

So, we actually don't have the bug that I thought we did (and that I was trying
to fix).  I misunderstood the original bug report to mean that bookmarklets
executed from the bookmarks manager were running with chrome privs; but that
isn't the case.  Stripping js/etc. from live bookmark feeds is still valid, so
that'll stay; however, the example chrome URL threw me off.

The issue here is that if the user navigates to a chrome: URI in a browser
window and then runs a bad bookmarklet, that bookmarklet executes with chrome
privs.  This I'm inclined to say is not a bug then, as it requires:

1) the user manually navigates to a chrome: URI
2) the user executes a bookmarklet that does bad stuff

Returning this back to fixed; ignore the second patch.

What protocols are allowed / disallowed in Live Bookmarks with the patch that
was checked in?
