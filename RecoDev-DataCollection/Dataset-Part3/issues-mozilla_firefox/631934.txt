The idea with childHitResult.shouldZoom is that GroupItem_childHit is able to return a false value to block the zoomin, but this actually isn't used, as far as I can see. We should simply remove this bit of logic from TabItem_zoomIn and GroupItem_childHit, instead using GroupItem_childHit to simply be called to return the callback, if necessary.

This is what I had in mind but, now that I look at it, I realize I think we could get rid of childHit completely... instead, in TabItem_zoomIn's onZoomDone, add a line that says:

> if (self.parent)
>   self.parent.collapse();

Removed the childHit method.

This actually needs to simply be |if (groupItem.expanded)|. This is bug 631936, but we could just fix it here.

Note: setActiveGroupItem will be removed from this section in bug 597980. I'll leave it up to Ian to decide how separate we want these patches to be, or, because they're all touching the same section of code, if we want to roll them all into one patch.

f+ with the if condition changed.

Yeah, we should just make the change here and retire that bug.

Let's land bug 597980 separately; that one actually fixes a bug, whereas this is just code clean-up.

Speaking of which, while code clean-up is certainly valuable, I think we're past the point where we should be doing it before the Fx4 release. It distracts us from fixing user-visible bugs (which should be our priority at this point), and it has the potential to cause new problems. That said, I'm okay with this patch (once it's been fixed up), as long as the drivers are, but please no more purely code clean-up patches before Fx4. Please do keep filing code clean-up bugs, but let's actually fix them after Fx4.

>+      else
>+        GroupItems.setActiveGroupItem(groupItem);
>+    }

Once bug 597980 lands, we can get rid of all of this, in favor of modifying this:

>+      if (shouldGroupCollapse)
>+        groupItem.collapse();

... to this: 

  if (self.parent && self.parent.expanded)
    self.parent.collapse();
    
Don't forget to add the self = this declaration back in, of course.

Only land this after bug 597980 has landed.

Not sure why this is called v1, but f+.

Looks good
What's the change in behavior with this patch? Any? Or is it just code cleanup?

Did it pass try?

Does the change need a new test, or does an existing test flex this codepath?

None. Just cleanup.

> Did it pass try?

Looks like it hasn't been sent. I'll send it now.

It's hit by multiple tests.

Passed try, modulo two known intermittent oranges.
