After landing Bug 599793.
Ctrl+Z is necessary twice to undo it.

First Ctrl+Z makes blank.
Second Ctrl+Z get previous value.

I think that first Ctrl+Z should get previous value.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Minefield with new profile
2. Open any page
3. Copy URL( or text) string to clipboard
4. Paste & Go( or Paste & Search)
5. Try to undo (Ctrl+Z or right-click > Undo)

Actual Results:
 Blank.

Expected Results:
 Should be previous value.

You mean this should be marked INVALID?
I don't think it's invalid. Seems like perhaps we should be using selectAll() rather than .value="".
Right, I just thought of that too.
Sorry spam .
This is valid bug.
