


To clarify, this bug is for creating a full browser theme based on the dark DevTools theme; for use in a DevTools specific branch.
I assume we will create the theme and then get feedback from UX? I would totally love to work on this.

Is this purely just colors or does it include tab shape etc.
Just a heads up, we will not be using all of the new dark theme colors from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors until Bug 947242 lands, but we should definitely use the ones from that palette for this theme.

By 'full browser theme' do you mean a theme that is installable via the appearance tab in about:addons?  I'm also curious how big of project you think this is going to be, or if you have any preliminary mockups available so we could make a guess.

I haven't really thought about the implementation aspects. I was referring to the scope of the theme covering all of the main browser chrome.

I don't have any mockups yet, so still figuring out what and how much will change.

oops, sorry.
Some notes:

- we should make sure this doesn't conflict with the "private browsing" dark theme if that's still something we want to do (Stephen?)
- I'm very worried about the tabs with no space above them, because they no longer allow the user to drag the window around. We had quite a number of bugs filed about that when working on Australis - Stephen, could we just skip that and work off the other side tabs from bug 1058854 ?
- Can we reuse the existing "inverted" iconset so we don't have to create yet more copies of Toolbar.png ?
- How far do we want to take this when it comes to dialogs, panels and (context) menus and the like?
- How do we envisage this vs. OS themes and things like Windows' High Contrast Mode and/or the "use author's colors" preference?

If someone wants to use this theme, it's unlikely that this user will use High contrast along with it.

Actually, that is very much false - good web developers test how their pages behave in high contrast mode (for accessibility requirements, among other things), and some (web) developers need to use high contrast mode in order to effectively use their computer.

As far as is practical given the timeline. It's very jarring to have a themed experience and then open a settings / preferences dialog and get the non-themed ui.

> - How do we envisage this vs. OS themes and things like Windows' High
> Contrast Mode and/or the "use author's colors" preference?

We should test high contrast mode to understand what the limitations are, and get feedback from Marco. I don't want to imagine problems where there are no reported ones yet, I want to tests and report actual bugs. So let's test this and at least understand what the limitations are wrt accessibility.

They are both dark, but they look different and PBM will still have another indicator.

I think we have an opportunity to do something here to achieve a specific goal without worrying about the implications on the broader release audience. I proposed we work around the drag issue by leaving some extra drag area on the sides of the tab strip.

I am fine with punting on the side tabs stuff since we don't have an exact plan there.

No, those won't match the DevTools theme.

We want to style those also, but I haven't done any design work there because I was focused on primary UI due to time constraints.

It should ignore OS theme variants, but might(?) want to take into account high contrast mode. Most high contrast modes are bright on dark though, so I am not sure exactly how beneficial that would be.

Does this mean it won't land on mozilla-central? Who's going to maintain this theme?

Also, why is this bug only visible to Mozilla employees?

The last I heard we were planning on the code living inside aurora/nightly only ifdefs, and for the actual theme to be toggled by a pref, which would be set by default for web devs using the special "devbrowser" edition of aurora to develop stuff. Last I checked it wasn't clear whether this would completely take over "regular" aurora or be a separate thing.

> Also, why is this bug only visible to Mozilla employees?

Because it's part of the birthday plans (9th of November, 10 years of Firefox) and, to that extent, "secret".
Saw this on Brian's build. I wouldn't use devbrowser as it is. The no-space-for-dragging is a dealbreaker. And for me the tabs looking like the devtools tabs is a bit confusing, and not as pretty as those rounded tabs. Otherwise looks good!

I don't think this one is necessary as an observer; changing theme requires a restart, right? So AFAIK the actual selected theme can't change at runtime. I don't know if the pref changes immediately if you switch to a different complete theme, in which case this would actually do the wrong thing right now.

There has to be a better way to do this... except I'm told that there isn't really.

You could use the chrome registry to get the URL for chrome://browser/skin/browser.css, and try to figure out if it's in the same kind of place as chrome://browser/content/browser.xul (we only ship 1 real theme, after all) but that's even more hacky, and this only fails if the user has set the pref to some non-existant value, so let's stick with this.

Stephen has said he wants different icons than the normal inverted ones, so I don't think we should be using this. We probably need a separate attribute that this code should set itself (because it knows what colors it's given to all the toolbars anyway, so calling into this (which causes sync layout flushes) isn't necessary).

We normally use attributes rather than classes on the window element; is there a compelling reason for classes here?

I'm a little wary of the light/dark stuff. The designs only feature the dark styles; especially with the discussion about the drag space / tab shape, if we use the current tab shape here, is there a compelling difference between "devtools light" and the regular theme that would require us to work on that right now (ie, what's the benefit of devtools-light over the 'regular' theme)? I think I would much prefer if we follow-up'd that (and only enabled this theme if the user had also selected the 'dark' option in the devtools prefs), but I'm open to argument otherwise.

This should include the non-aero variant of the windows file instead, with a define so that you can check for that case. That way you don't have to duplicate stuff between the aero and non-aero variants. See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/browser-aero.css .

Could probably do with adding a CSS var for Toolbar.png, and updating that if the devtools attribute is set on :root? (Would need to update the things that currently rely on the attribute inferFromText sets to set the var to the -inverted variant, while the devtools theme isn't enabled, with something like :root:not([devtoolstheme]) toolbar[brighttext] { --... })

Oh, on another note, once we start CSS variable-ifying stuff, this will need try pushes with talos runs (tpaint/ts_paint, probably), to ensure we're not affecting perf (too much)... I don't know how optimized our layout code's css variables stuff is. :-(

Yes, I've just copied the structure of browser.css.  I'd also be happy to make a single shared file and use preprocessor directives for platform specific things - I'm not sure how much will be needed.  A couple of comments below:

Good point, I've just tested switching themes with removing the listener and it is working better.

Hm, I wish that we could use the standard inverted icons at least by default so non toolbar.png fixes like bugs 1018845 and 1075415 will also work here automatically.  If not we will also need new images for the bookmarks chevron / full screen button / any other buttons that get inverted but aren't included in the toolbar.png sprite to match the new icon coloring.

IMO the inverted icons look pretty good with the dark theme even if they don't perfectly match the coloring in the toolbox as per comment 16.  But I can remove this from this patch anyway since it isn't necessary right now.

Note that you can get the same look for toolbar icons by using 0.8 opacity on current icons.

We don't really have theme tests, so I guess browser/base/content/test/general, for want of somewhere better? Either that or in devtools.

So now we're using the devtools theme irrespective of whether the user has selected the light or dark devtools theme, is that intentional? I kind of assumed we would keep this contingent on also having the dark devtools theme enabled; sorry if that wasn't clear before - I just figured, we'd use the normal, default theme for the devtools light case, and the devtools one if the devtools theme is set to dark.

(we should keep the general pref so that we can toggle this off for normal/other aurora builds and/or if something blows up and we decide not to enable it by default or whatever)

ToolbarIconColor.inferFromText should definitely be called here, even if you want to override some icons with custom ones.

Because the brighttext attribute is supposed to reflect reality rather than some previous state. Also, it's highly unlikely that you'll want to override all icons where that attribute is used.
It also looks like we'll need to update browser/themes/osx/browser.css to use [brighttext] instead of :-moz-lwtheme-brighttext. Up until now this didn't matter because the only means to get a dark theme on OS X was to apply a lightweight theme.

Thinking about this, I think it'd make sense to split out the devtoolstheme pref from the other ones, and not run _update for it (ie just update the root attribute). It probably makes sense to chuck that in a function (however trivial it is) so that we can also call it from init().

IIRC the data param should tell you which pref changed here.

Ah, no.  I misunderstood the last comment - I had just copied some of the boilerplate from another test in the folder but obviously it was doing more than we need here.

20:57	jorendorff	Gijs: shoot
20:58	Gijs	jorendorff: the question I asked in bug 1038259 is blocking some devtools stuff - can we rely on JS template strings shipping, ie can we use them in chrome?
20:59	jorendorff	Gijs: This is really a question about future compatibility. The danger is that the JS standard committee may tweak the syntax or semantics before ES6 ships.
21:00	Gijs	jorendorff: I'm hearing "no" :)
21:00	jorendorff	Gijs: In-tree uses will are fine either way.
21:00	Gijs	ah
21:00	Gijs	ok
21:00	Gijs	jorendorff: guesstimate how likely syntax/semantics changes are at this point?
21:02	jorendorff	Gijs: Very hard for me to estimate. They haven't changed now for months, but TC39 is super capricious about anything that hasn't shipped in multiple implementations.
21:02	jorendorff	Gijs: I'd say 92% chances ES6 ships with template strings basically unchanged.
21:03	jorendorff	Make that 90%.
21:05	Gijs	jorendorff: is anyone else implementing?
21:05	jorendorff	Haven't heard anything. cpeterson might know

21:11	Gijs	Mook_as, jorendorff: OK, thanks.

So ymmv. I will r+ with or without per jorendorff's "in-tree uses will are fine either way" [sic]. Note that you should push to try if you haven't already, to be sure the js parsable test (yeah, I added one after the css one...) doesn't fall over this because reflect.jsm gets sad. It shouldn't, but you never know (and I've seen it break on the previously-standardized array comprehension format). :-)
I have a try push and don't see any issues with the js parsing: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=651553f41efa.  I don't have my heart set on using the template strings, the code just looks a little nicer with it.

Updated as per comments.  I added inferFromText when the stylesheet was added / removed but didn't for when the devtools theme changes yet because it's not entirely clear when and how the devtools theme changes will affect toolbar coloring (and it seems to have a perf impact).  So I'll just add that part in for a future patch.

The entity name and the string are contradictory (disable vs. use).

Customize mode contains a dropdown for selecting lightweight themes. Seems like this checkbox would fit better next to that.

What seems ideal would be if this showed up in the theme listing just below "Default" and acts like the others (except that it can't be removed).  When all the conditions were right then this entry would be selected instead of Default (even though the Default theme is really applied).  I don't know how much work that would be, especially since similar things may have to be done in Customize mode.

DevTools seems like a Mozilla-internal type of name. Is that what we want to call this? <bikeshed>Maybe "Use the Developer Tools theme for &brandShortName;"?</bikeshed>

We'll probably also need a theme name that will be used for Customization mode as well as the Add-ons Manager unless that isn't being pursued by this bug (seems like comment #66 is saying that it is not being pursued).

Re-reading all the comments a third time, I guess you're asking for advice? While I'm flattered ( :-) ), this seems like a UX decision.

Adding a fake theme in about:addons IMO isn't a realistic option in the timeframe we're looking at (and even outside that timeframe, I think it's fraught with problems so I wouldn't recommend it).

Stephen/Philipp, can either of you advise on whether this makes more sense in the main preferences or in customize mode (or both) ?
Created attachment 8503287
devedition-string.patch

Talked with shorlander about this - we are going to go with a checkbox in customize mode with "Use &brandShortName; Theme" as the label.  This checkbox will only show up in the Dev Edition channel (though the theme can still be preffed on in any channel by flipping a pref).
Created attachment 8503351
devedition-part3-osx.patch

Dão / Gijs, I'd like some feedback on this general approach.  This patch just has the osx changes that basically extract some hardcoded or preprocessed values and turn them into CSS variables.  So after applying this patch alone the browser should look exactly the same as when it is not applied.  Then future patch would change these variables for the dev edition theme.

Beyond general feedback, here are the main questions / concerns I have:

1) In the toolkit files (popup.css, autocomplete.css) for some reason CSS variables don't work when applied to :root even though that works in the other files.  I can file a bug for this if nothing sticks out.
2) I'm not really sure everywhere that would be affected by changes to autocomplete.css.  I see it on the search box (which is what I want) but these seem like generic enough selectors that I'm not sure if I should find somewhere else to put these changes.
3) Should I change *all* preprocessor variables in browser.css to css variables or keep it to only the things that we need to change for now.  I'd imagine that there are some cases where it will not be straightforward to change the values, but I'm not sure.

Airport comment without looking at much else: I bet this is because the files you mentioned get included as part of XBL, and are "special" in whatever way. They don't show up in the devtools style editor either, for instance. Not sure how hard it'd be to fix this particular issue (which sounds like a bug, but I've not thought about it too hard nor looked at how exactly you're trying to use variables in there... perhaps setting the var on the root of the binding (ie the panel/popup bit for popup.css) might help? Unsure.

Because they're scoped stylesheets?

autocomplete.css is widely used, including autocomplete popups in the content area.

You made the normal region variable (not quite sure why) but not the one for hover, which doesn't make sense as they depend on each other.

Thanks Stephen for the designs.  Here is my current progress on the autocompletes.  I have 2 specific questions based on this:

1) For the in content popups (see the second screenshot in the image), should these have the normal white styling (unaffected by the new theme) or should they look something like they do in this screenshot (matching the search results area)?  I'm not positive if there is a way to distinguish between these two places in CSS, but I can check into that.
2) In the location bar there is a special highlight for the matching parts of the string.  Should that stay / go / be changed somehow?

As I've said in Comment 88, I'm not sure if there is a way to specify styles that should be applied only when the popup is opened on a particular element (like the search box).  Still waiting to hear if we want styles to be applied to all popups or just this one.

That's how the designs are mocked up.  Stephen has suggested to instead add 50px extra padding to the left and right of the tab strip to give dragging space.

Generally I would argue that accessibility and usability shouldn't be compromised even if the target audience /tends/ to be more enabled and advanced users. There are always exceptions to that tendency, and good reasons for having the space above the tabs don't become void here. (If the reasons aren't that good, we should just get rid of that space in the default theme.)

Another concern is that letting this theme unnecessarily depart from the default theme unnecessarily increases the maintenance cost. This is also a concern I see with the square tabs, considering that our tab-related CSS is rather complex. By the way, my question about who's going to own and maintain this theme still appears to be unanswered.

That's discussion to have with Stephen - the most recent thing I've heard is that the extra 50px on the sides will replace the space on the top.  FWIW I also have concerns about accessibility.  As one example, I've had times when switching between external displays and my smaller laptop screen where the browser ends up  wider than the screen and I need to drag it to a side to be able to resize it - the extra space on the sides may not be showing up in this case.

The less departure there is from the main theme the easier to maintain it will be (it'd be ideal if we could get this theme to eventually only consist of a set of CSS variables).  AFAIK The developer edition is going to be maintained by the devtools team.

Inverted Menu Panel Icons
There is another broken test, test_leaf_layers_partition_browser_window.xul on Windows 7 and 8 debug builds only. Not XP, not other platforms, not optimized builds.

It starts failing ever since the first runs of the mochitest-other suite, and it was only green at that time when you backed out the shared, OS X and Linux theme changes in a separate push (which means I should now apologize for whining about that push ;-) ). I'm guessing the shared patch is the culprit, but I'm sure you can confirm it easily by backing that out and running the test locally (I would have done that myself if my Windows VM wasn't about a year old, which basically means bye-bye weekend).

I started seeing some weird popup locations on my build about a week ago [0][1], even without any patches applied.  I'm not sure what is causing it, but browser_880164_customization_context_menus.js is failing for me locally even without anything applied, so it's very hard to debug.  I've pulled down the latest changes, clobbered, rebuilt and am still seeing the issue.  The weird thing is if I pull down a build from Gum I don't see the problem anymore, so I'm still looking into it.

The menu positioning stuff might be bug 1083724?

Blargh, treeherder's log viewer is hard to read.

If I understand correctly from what you're saying, we never show the toolbar context menu for the url bar correctly, here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_880164_customization_context_menus.js#111

Note comments:
117   // Need to make sure not to click within an edit field.
118   let urlbarRect = urlBarContainer.getBoundingClientRect();
119   EventUtils.synthesizeMouse(urlBarContainer, 100, urlbarRect.height - 1, {type: "contextmenu", button: 2 });
120   yield shownPromise;

If the new style means that height - 1 is inside the edit field, we probably get the wrong context menu leading to a timeout...

This is OS X 10.6 debug; is it broken elsewhere?

It's not super hard to just make that test add a non-removable widget to the navbar and test on that instead, so there's no context menu conflict, so we could do that to workaround?

Then there's the question of why it fails locally before the patch (which was what Brian said), which doesn't really make sense either... perhaps that's a separate bug?
Ah, so opt is also broken. That might make sense considering the explanation.

The windows failure is more annoying. You can search for other bugs with that test; it basically boils down to there being layers of chrome that overlap content. The best way to debug is... pushing a debug patch that makes it actually dump the frame tree, after which you then get to spend time trying to figure out where the overlap is (I'm not aware of us having a tool for this, but it's possible layout/graphics folks can help you there).

The alternative is figuring out what you're doing that might over/underlap content... if you're messing with the titlebar and/or removing the overflow: -moz-hidden-unscrollable stuff that we added to avoid this, that might be the thing.

As Dão pointed out, this is used pretty widely. Generally, we use platform-dependent colors there (I think?). I can point you to a number of places where OS themes make websites not display nicely if you use a dark theme, because the OS colors don't match the site, or the site sets only foreground/background and not the other.

I'd therefore prefer to have this stuff specific to the browser chrome through judicious use of selectors. We could technically use variables here and then only set the variables differently in the devedition theme for other selectors, I think? However, at that point I wonder if it isn't more sensible / less code to just override the colors for those autocomplete popups (for which we're already having to use more specific selectors) without the use of variables.

Does that make sense and/or do you think we should also be styling content autocomplete boxes?

Hm. It's kind of odd that this needs adding; is it not set higher up? i.e. if this is transparent then something else needs to be white here, I would think - why can't we CSS variable that?

Is there a way to specifically target just changes to chrome popups?  I think this would be best also.

Not that I know of, except perhaps by using a document url prefix query for browser.xul... what autocomplete dropdowns do we have in browser.xul though? Isn't it just the urlbar and search bar? Might make more sense to just select those specifically, assuming that's possible.

The urlbar is styled via .autocomplete-richlistbox, I'm not sure if that is used anywhere in content but it would be great if we could target it specifically for the URL bar just to be safe.

The search bar popup is inside the #PopupAutoComplete panel, but that is also used for in-content autocomplete popups, like here: http://codepen.io/michelmarrache/pen/JEGhr.  I'd like to know if there is a way to distinguish between the two using a selector, because the popup seems to be in the same place in the DOM for both.  Maybe there is an attribute for which element it is attached to?  I'm not seeing anything but I could be missing it.

The case where it would make sense to keep variables would be if the implementations were different between all three platforms (so we would need to have multiple duplicated selectors).  But I think they are using pretty much the same selectors in all three autocomplete.css files.  I can revert changes to autocomplete.css and instead add a change to the binding that will allow us to target certain popups more specifically:

#PopupAutoCompleteRichResult[autocompleteInput="urlbar"],
#PopupAutoComplete[autocompleteInput="searchbar-textbox"] {
  /* Only target the two autocompletes we care about */
}

Then add these selectors in devedition.css in the shared patch as suggested.

Two notes about the linux changes:

1) For the back button, the changes for OSX are in the part 2 shared patch in browser/themes/osx/devedition.css.  I believe that it's done differently across platforms, but setting border-radius: 0 and background-color: #252C33 should be a start.  I'm guessing that we won't be able to variable-ify that part of it, so if you can make the changes to that file and include it in the linux patch I'll split it out and put it back into the correct place.
2) Don't worry about any changes to autocomplete.css, those will be overridden in devedition.inc.css.

I'll double check with the back button on OSX, but it seems to work for me.  Could be an issue with retina or Yosemite if you are using that.

On OSX, you need to target #back-button itself.

While on Linux and Windows, you need to target #back-button > .toolbarbutton-icon

This fixes most of the issues on Linux. These are rather small changes. What's missing is text and separator colors in panels.

I'm actually a little confused... AIUI, the OS X bits to prep for this have landed on Nightly, but not the Linux or Windows bits, right? Can we split things up so that we deal with this platform-by-platform, and particularly, so we don't land/review/do dev theme stuff for platforms where the prep stuff hasn't landed/been reviewed/been done yet?

IOW, can I just review the OS X bit for now and/or review the Windows prep bits (which AIUI are a different, not-yet-landed patch)? :-)

Having looked for a bit... where do the search icons come from? Do we have a bug on unifying this instead of just overriding it? In theory, we should be able to use the text color and use a single SVG in all themes. I'm also confused on how this works with the light theme, or is this just the dark one for now - the colors look hardcoded?

From a casual look, it also seems this uses rather a lot of blanket !important (e.g. back button on Windows) which I should hope isn't necessary, and there's some unfinished comments in there ( "+/* Toolbar hover should be back to default when the */")

I'm not sure about this as it makes the tabbar look very strange, especially when the tab scroll arrows appear. I'd rather keep those aero border in this case.

The OS X bits haven't landed yet, but I could do that now (it's r+ but I wasn't sure if we should land it ahead of time or wait until the others were ready).  Do you think I should split that patch up to include just the variables that are needed for the primary changes, or leave it to include the variables needed for secondary changes as well?  FWIW the initial linux/windows patches will *not* include the secondary variables (hopefully we can handle the entire secondary UI in a follow up bug).

Sorry that this is confusing - the changes in the separate patches (window/linux/osx) do not include any visual changes at all, just adding variables.  Changes in this patch to windows/devedition.css, linux/devedition.css, and osx/devedition.css etc should be reviewable separately from the variable patches.  Would it make things easier I filed a different bug for these variable patches?

So, there are no inverted search icons in the tree right now.  We have this new Search.svg file that handles all the different variations that we may need for dev edition (inverted and non-inverted in both forward facing and backward facing variations).  All are toggleable via a URL fragment.  So you can load any of these:

chrome://browser/skin/devedition/Search.svg#search-icon
chrome://browser/skin/devedition/Search.svg#search-icon-inverted
chrome://browser/skin/devedition/Search.svg#search-icon-mac-inverted
chrome://browser/skin/devedition/Search.svg#search-icon-mac

I asked Stephen if he wanted to instead provide separate search-inverted.png icons for each platform, but he indicated we could stick with the SVG file in the patch.  I'm sure he could provide those images if it would be better for organization.

Thanks, I folded these changes into the primary and secondary patches.  Did you make any updates to the variables patch (attachment 8502514) or have you been working only on the linux/devedition.css file?

I think it makes sense to land the r+'d and ready variable changes now, mostly to get more test coverage / baking on nightly. If that includes secondary UI, that sounds fine to me. It'll help avoid bitrot, too.

I think I'd prefer to do this per-platform. Is there some reason that's not possible? I guess some things are shared; I don't think it's the end of the world if we land things that look temporarily not-great on platforms that haven't been reviewed/completed yet - it's all behind a pref anyway.

I don't really mind having it in this bug, it just felt weird getting an r? for a patch that depended on another patch that wasn't even on the bug (I mid-aired with Tim attaching the latest version). :-)

Review of attachment 8509838:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm only looking at mac so far, because it's easier to test considering the variable bits have been reviewed already, and because there's a lot of stuff to delve into there that applies to the other themes anyway. Don't get me wrong, it generally looks pretty good already, but getting this stuff right is hard (see also: http://www.gijsk.com/blog/2014/04/why-doing-visual-refreshes-of-firefox-is-hard/ - there are a couple of points here that don't apply, like lwt, but still a heck of a lot that do). f+ on the mac/shared bits for perseverance! :-)

General notes (more below):

- this seems to unconditionally apply even when I select the light theme in devtools. My thinking was that we could continue to use the default theme there for now? Is that difficult to implement? :-)
- I don't see secondary UI being affected (dropdowns, panels, etc.). Is that right or should I be seeing this? I've only applied the r+'d mac patch and this one, perhaps I'm missing something?
- the fullscreen button almost isn't visible anymore. If we get an asset for it, you could override the -moz-mac-fullscreen-button appearance and use an image and some sizing instead, so you can actually see it clearly. :-)
- the auto-hiding of the forward button is a little broken: the button disappears completely instead of just getting disabled. The sliding away seems to work as expected.
- the back button's icon is still bigger than the forward button's, even though the buttons are the same size. There's a different icon at the 'next' spot in the grid that matches; you should be able to use that.
- there's an odd white line at the top of the window in fullscreen mode when the titlebar is disabled (default); not sure if that's fixable.
- toolbarbutton colors are opaque, instead of rgba/hsla, so now when you put toolbar buttons on the tabs toolbar, their hover effect isn't visible at all anymore
- there is some kind of weird interplay with switching in and out of the theme in customize mode and pinned tabs / overflowed tabs toolbar. STR are something like:
  * start with clean profile
  * create enough tabs to overflow, and one pinned tab
  * enable devtools theme in about:config
  * go into customize mode
  * click restore to defaults
  note how now the pinned tab and the button for the tab overflow overlap. The same happens if you e.g. use the lwt switcher in customize mode.
- the 'active' download icon is misaligned or the wrong size
- PopupNotification anchors (e.g. geolocation/addon/password prompts) in the url bar still have a white background. I don't know how well the icons will work on a black background... that last part might just want to be a followup if they don't work well.

Instead of hiding it, can you set content: none? Then there shouldn't be an ::after at all.

More !important sprinkling. I'm not sure how I feel about this - on the one hand, I guess this keeps the selectors simpler, but on the other, without delving into this too deeply, it seems pretty random, which things get !important, and which things don't.

Forwarding request to Gijs, who has more context here
More notes:

- the url bar is too high compared to the search bar (they should remain the same height)
- the url bar has no margin underneath it, but 2-3px above it. Those margins should be symmetrical.

That'd be easy to implement, pending a UX decision about it.

That's right, the panels and menus are all in the devedition-secondary.patch file (which I hope to get reviewed/landed separately, since this is big enough as it is!)

Bug 1018845 is opened for that.  I got the impression from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1018845#c9 that it requires more than just CSS.

So it's using visibility:hidden because the current clip-path is wrong (it is a circle to cover the original back button).  I updated the patch to use a new rectangular clip-path which seems to work, but I don't really know what's going on with that so I'll definitely need another set of eyes.

Done - switched that for 1px 'normal' state in devedition.inc.css and 1x 'active' state along with 2x normal/active in osx/devedition.css.

Maybe is just that download-glow.png icon looking funny with the dark background?  I'm not really seeing it becoming misaligned.  Do you see the same issue on a dark lw theme?

Yes, this would probably be best in the secondary patch or not a follow up bug (for future reference: https://www.dropbox.com/s/m3wko1zf6homi0p/Screenshot%202014-10-23%2011.13.48.png?dl=0).

Taking this out causes the window resize buttons / fullscreen buttons to show up pretty low: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0tpv214h5rzvqw2/Screenshot%202014-10-23%2011.18.57.png?dl=0.

This also reminded me that I should change the shared CSS to only add the 50px left/right spacing when tabs are in the titlebar.

No, the size change isn't intentional.  Looks like it is because the hover border color is transparent but the active border color is hsla(0,0%,0%,.3) and not variable-ified yet (oops).  Also, I'm happy to change the active state's bg color (and I'll do so using alpha values so we can just lighten up the hover state and darken the active).

It is used as a border but it is styled with background-color.  Although now that you mention it, this is the wrong color for it, which explains why there was only 1px below the URL bar.  Targetting #navigator-toolbox::after only and switching the bg to --chrome-secondary-background-color fixes that issue as well.

Unfortunately there is a selector like #PersonalToolbar:-moz-window-inactive:not(:-moz-lwtheme), #nav-bar:-moz-window-inactive:not(:-moz-lwtheme) (http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#195) that sets the background for inactive windows.

Yes, just to be triple sure that it applies ;).  No, just kidding, that's terrible.  I've got rid of the important and moved it to the osx/devedition.css file, using only the fullscreen selector since this is the only time I've seen the issue (it fixes this issue when in full screen: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gpzfeoclujcbjmm/Screenshot%202014-10-23%2012.29.28.png?dl=0).

The brighttext stuff only gets :not([selected=true]):not(:hover).  So for the selected tab it looks weird without this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p23slmv80vqjpeq/Screenshot%202014-10-23%2012.32.21.png?dl=0.  I'll update the selector and add a comment to explain.

Don't do that with selector modifications that don't otherwise make sense, it leads to code that nobody understands. Use !important if you have to.

Because of the following bit you quoted. Note that that used to be without the [tabsintitlebar] selector, so the linux reset can probably just go away now - tabsintitlebar is never set there.

This seems like a more indirect way of saying "I don't want this displayed". Why would that be preferable over display:none?

Huh, that's surprising to me; the --space-above-tabbar definition is in shared, and that will affect Windows as well, AIUI. Brian?

Because I expected that with display:none the ::after gc will still be in the node tree, whereas content: none should just make it actually go away - it seems that isn't the case.

Personally, I still think that because the content property is what makes an ::after/::before frame actually exist, content:none is at least as clear. In any case, YMMV, I won't lose sleep over switching this back to display:none if you feel strongly.

To be clear: *both* display:none/content:none make the gc disappear from the node tree, which surprised me considering that's not what happens for normal display:none nodes. :-)

Can't this just be a flat background-color? Also, can we make this be ...combined-separator-backgroundcolor/boxshadow , as that's what it is?

And, if we want to change these, we should also be styling the separators of the zoom and clipboard buttons, which are in panelUIOverlay.css (but also affect the in-navbar styling)

As far as I can tell this selector and its win8 cousin are dead. We only use this for the menubuttons, not for the combined buttons, where we just style the real separators. I don't see a ::before in the inspector for any of the cut/copy/paste and zoom in/reset/out buttons.

Margin bottom - there is a 1px overlap in osx/browser.css: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#3036.  I've updated to be more specific and added a comment.

Yes, looks osx specific - it's this rule: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#3044.  I'll move it to the OSX file and make it important instead of using the lwtheme selector as you suggest later.

This doesn't really make sense to me. There's a checked style on aero as well, surely? Why doesn't that need to be updated for the devedition theme?

But now you've modified them here, but without changing the original rules in panelUIOverlay.css? I don't think that's the right approach - those rules are effectively dead now, right? Either do it properly here, or file a followup bug.

A couple of comments:
- shared/panelarrow-*.svg are missing. I added them myself.
- I changed --identity-box-*-background-image to --identity-box-*-background. This will require an update of the mac and windows patches
- there's still work to do for close buttons and arrow content.

checked style = active style.

Because otherwise, with the secondary patch, the sub popups of the bookmarks popup will be white, while the popup itself will be dark.

The OSX variable landed like this. So it'd make more sense to change everything in one follow up patch.

I'm actually thinking this won't work, because the same variables will be redefined in identity-block.inc.css (which is included in this file and will overwrite the default values of these variables).  So it will end up using the values from that file instead of the ones defined in the :root here.

It seems like it would be simpler to add in ifdef linux to http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/identity-block.inc.css#8 so that the proper colors are set in the first place (and this entire rule can be removed)

This variable is used in browser/themes/shared/identity-block.inc.css, and I'm not sure actually sure if we could change it to background (looks like the position/size/repeat are set in a different rule than the image).  See the note above about getting rid of this override in browser.css and moving it to identity-block.inc.css anyway.

I think we want the ability to style the full border in this variable though.  For instance, the default osx popup doesn't have any border width so if we changed this to just a color we would have to add a 1px transparent border by default (http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/osx/global/popup.css#10).

In that case, it sounds like we need to have more than one variable, or just deal with OS X by having the OS X devedition.css actually set a 1px border width?

Having to re-set the variable to some other value in the default theme (which, AIUI, is what the current theme does) is kind of fragile if/when we have to update the value.

The styles here were emulating the arrow panel styles, but without the arrow, as mentioned here :
"/* emulating chrome://browser/content/places/menu.xml#places-popup-arrow but without the arrow */".

We could do it that way (change it to border-color then have a width hardcoded in the osx file).  Would you prefer this change and the variable name change from --toolbarbutton-combined-boxshadow to --toolbarbutton-combined-separator-boxshadow (including updating osx) happens within this patch or should it be done separately once windows/linux have landed?

OK, let's do those refactors after the windows and linux patches land (especially since the CSS variable changes may have to be backed out depending on the perf regression).

Now I remember why I switched this to opacity, at least on OSX there is a border image with an arrow that is white.  Using opacity allowed it to not stick out so bad but to still have the arrow match.

As per a discussion with :jaws on IRC, we should actually be able to leave this alone since this is here to add an opaque background to the semi-transparent default background in identity-block.inc.css.  In our case with a fully opaque --identity-box-chrome-background-image, this color will not matter.

So this doesn't include the secondary UI variables needed for panels and menus, but it has enough for the primary patch (which I will upload next).  Also, the URL icon will be handled in the primary patch as well, since there the url history dropmarker is just using -moz-appearance: toolbarbutton-dropdown (nothing to override with variables).

Again, only looked at OS X and shared stuff so far. This looks better, but there's still quite some things that need help. Let's start with the last round, liberally snipped to omit bits that are either fixed, spun off, or hard/impossible to fix.

This: http://imgur.com/Gdi8eMh . Note how the line next to the < button is 1px less tall than the tab separators. I don't actually for sure know why this is, but it should ideally be fixed. :-)

Stephen, if the light devtools theme is applied, should we (1) keep the dark browser theme or (2) switch to Australis styling?  Ideally there would be a (3) here, which is use the devedition theme but with light colors, but that's not likely to happen for the initial release.

Changes since the last version -

* adds in variables for --toolbarbutton-active-bordercolor and --toolbarbutton-active-bordercolor
* improves the combined button styling.

Also folds in the linux devedition.css changes.  Carrying over the f?dao for the windows stuff from the last patch (you'll have to have the latest devedition-part4-windows patch applied also to see most changes).

Brian, you asked me earlier to look at the hover/active state of the bookmark widget on Linux. As far as I can tell, it works as expect. All these 6 variables:
--toolbarbutton-hover-background
--toolbarbutton-hover-boxshadow

--toolbarbutton-active-background
--toolbarbutton-active-boxshadow
--toolbarbutton-active-bordercolor

This is already set on non-aero with the same values and selectors. So it makes sense to me to remove them.

You're right, I missed that from looking at the interdiff. Carry on!

Note: the linux theme uses a single color, and uses it in border: 1px solid --var(); style. The Windows theme uses 3 separate colors in some cases, and uses it with border-color: --var(). A quick test seems to indicate that something along the lines of:

border: 1px solid red green blue;

is not valid CSS.

I don't know if the devtools theme is going to use multiple colors, but if it is, the border: properties below should be split so that we set border-color to the variable. In fact, maybe that's a good idea just to be safe.

So, if I call gBrowser.tabContainer._positionPinnedTabs(); after removing the devedition stylesheet this is fixed.  I'm assuming I shouldn't be doing this since that's an underscore prefixed function - is there is a better way to accomplish this?  I'm not really seeing the border between the tabs and navbar disappearing with or without the change, so I can't confirm it fixes that problem too.  I'll upload the patch with this change to see if it resolves both issues for you.

It's for the Windows menu bar - here is what it looks like without the :not(#toolbar-menubar) rule: https://www.dropbox.com/s/murackfjdzij1p6/Screenshot%202014-10-28%2009.37.53.png?dl=0.  And with: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ooceiatn8g5or7/Screenshot%202014-10-28%2009.38.51.png?dl=0.

It's because of http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/shared/tabs.inc.css#121, I've added a rule with margin-bottom: 0, which fixes this.  Ideally we could switch the @tabToolbarNavbarOverlap@ variable to a CSS variable, but I don't want to add anything else that might affect perf for v1.

Actually just needed to move this selector below the next list (the :hover style was overriding selected), so no more important.

Carrying over f?dao.  Gijs, see comments 188, 190, and 208 in response to your previous feedback.  I was going to hold off asking for formal review until getting further feedback on windows/linux and a UX review (which Stephen is working on), but if you can review / give further feedback on the shared/osx/linux bits I wouldn't complain.

Note: I'm aware of the issue with the white hover state with the back/forward buttons on Yosemite, which I believe is because the styles here include :hover which makes the selector more specific than the one in osx/devedition.css: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#1695.  This is another time where I'm not clear if it's better to update the selector list to match, or to just use !important.  Anyway, I've updated the selector list for now which hopefully will fix that (although I don't have Yosemite set up so I haven't tested it).

Asked Stephen about whether to use a transparent background here, and he said "I like fully transparent, but it might conflict with some of the icons".  So we are going to try transparent and see how things look.  Either way, the changes in devedition-secondary for notification-popup are not needed so I'll remove them.  I think this would be simpler to get this effect with just:

#notification-popup-box {
  border-radius: 0;
  border: none;
  background: transparent;
}

Which I'll fold into the primary patch

These have no retriggers; because of talos noise, you should ensure that each of the "o" and "s" runs has been run at least 5 times on the platform(s) you care about (linux and linux64, in this case).

OK, I've triggered ~ 10 times for each test.  The results seem fine for linux on cart, tpaint and tspaint - should we checkin the linux patch or wait for more data?

It's a linux patch, so if linux is OK (which it looks to be), I think we can land it. There's no sane reason as to how that patch would affect any other platforms. :-)

This is difficult to say... from a quick look, it seems that the code there relies on the boundingclientrect of the tabs within their container, which changes in this theme switch. I don't think we have any other code that alters this (adding buttons to the left of the tabs, for instance, will be outside the container. Dão would know better than me what to do here.

I think that we should ideally make sure that the menubar gets the same background as the tabstoolbar, and there isn't such an odd "gap" there - I imagine that for that to work, we'd need to give the toolbox a background and ensure that the menubar's foggy background isn't applied in aero themes. I'm OK with followup-ing that in the interest of landing this sooner rather than later, though.

Can you put a comment here and say that we normally rely on the pointer events on the other tab elements, but that this theme hides those elements and therefore we need the pointer events on this layer instead?

Done - I'll also upload a new patch because I think I've had to rebase since the last upload, and also done a few UX requests in the meantime
Created attachment 8513609
lwtheme-preview-listener.patch

Breaking the JS changes into their own patch.  The main thing this patch does is fix the lightweight theme preview as seen in the customize UI or the addons page.  It also includes the pinned tabs position fix.

I'm not actually sure this is the best way to do it - I would have preferred to just add a check to document.documentElement.hasAttribute("lwtheme") in place of the current check on the lightweightThemes.isThemeSelected pref in the hope that it would cover both previewed and selected cases.  But it didn't work as I expected - during the "lightweight-theme-styling-update" event, the attribute is exactly the opposite of what I would think.  If data is null then the attribute exists, but if data is the theme being previewed it doesn't.

Dão, as mentioned in Comment 220, do you have any thoughts about the call to tabContainer._positionPinnedTabs?  Is there another way to do this, or should I un-underscore-prefix that function if this is the best way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?

Rebased, some UX fixes, and without js.  Gijs, going to ask for review on the osx/linux/shared changes with the knowledge that I will still need to make some UX updates as Stephen completes testing - but assuming those interdiffs will be pretty simple.  Leaving feedback for Dão for the windows changes.

The lwtheme attribute is set in response to lightweight-theme-styling-update. If your observer runs before that, the attribute won't be updated yet.

This was going to be r=me for OS X and shared styling, with the two comments below addressed. However... I noticed the back/fwd button have no hover style on either OS X or Linux. Can we fix that? :-)

Linux needs some more work. There are some comments below already. The other thing I was wondering is why the menubar is unstyled on Linux, too (which looks quite odd/jarring), and why the buttons have a different border-radius style.

Not sure why there's a :not([brighttext]) here; the consequence of this is that I'm seeing dark close icons instead of the bright close icons that I see on OS X. Not intentional, I presume?

This should be 1px 0px. The background in the default theme is basically "light, dark, light", with the visual "border" being in the middle. This "border" should be in the same position to avoid it looking like it shifts when you toggle the theme (and to keep the spacing of the icon symmetrical).

I'm assuming you're calling _positionPinnedTabs because the measurements done in that method become off when removing your stylesheet, because that stylesheet changed the dimensions of the tabs, the scroll buttons etc.. Given that, I don't understand why you wouldn't need to call _positionPinnedTabs when /adding/ your stylesheet too.

Yosemite back button in :-moz-window-inactive

I promised I'd look at the yosemite stuff. That looks mostly fine, except for this: when you remove focus from the window, the back buttons get this look...

Probably just a question of overriding this set of selectors:

Right, I had only tested going from dev edition to classic but surely it is a problem going the other way too.  So you are OK in general with calling _positionPinnedTabs here, as long as it's done in both places?

lwtheme-preview-listener.patch

Dão, awaiting your approval for the use of _positionPinnedTabs as in Comment 231.  I've updated the patch to call it in both adding and removing scenarios.

Gijs, re-asking for review here because I fixed a bug in the customize mode dropdown where the default theme ID comes through in a "lightweight-theme-styling-update" message when picking it from the theme dropdown.  This was causing a bug when:

1) Apply dev edition theme
2) open customize mode -> theme dropdown
3) Select a lw theme
4) Select the default theme

At this point the devedition theme never got reapplied, because the default theme came through as a lightweight theme update (so we force removed the stylesheet).  With this change I ignore that message just as if no lw theme was applied.  I also added a test for this.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by unstyled menubar here.  I'm seeing something like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrulcbfqh7thos6/Screenshot%202014-10-30%2018.30.42.png?dl=0, which I looks alright to me since it matches the title bar above.  Also, which buttons have a different border-radius style?  I've updated some of the back/forward styling from your notes later, so maybe that fixes it?

OK, so there were a couple of things wrong with this.  First, it was including close-icon which it shouldn't have been.  Second, there was an lw theme selector in browser.css that wasn't being applied so I changed in linux/browser.css to use TabsToolbar[brighttext] instead of :-moz-lwtheme-brighttext.  The only change we needed to make now in this file is to .tab-close-button[selected]:not(:hover).

The syntax is broken, and if this rule worked, it would make the other one above entirely redundant.

Looks like a good number of my comments on the previous version still apply here.

The intention was so that we didn't have a variable called '--color', '--background-color', etc by being a little more descriptive in what it is styling.  I don't feel too strongly about that particular prefix.  The stuff that's just targeting tabs could probably be shortened to 'tab-*'.

Review of attachment 8514769:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I have a feeling the next one will be the one as far as OS X is concerned!

Apart from the code nits below, I have one more thing on OS X, spurred on by Matt's private browsing testing: if you turn on the titlebar and open a private window, the titlebar styling is messed up. :-(

For Linux, I added screenshots for a bunch of things (including the border-radius question you asked). The other "glaring" things are:
- as mentioned in bug 1091711, the new tab button looks 'off' (NB: also affects lw themes, but /should/ just be a question of using brighttext attribute...)
- the bookmarks button has a broken hover state when in the navbar - the separator in the middle goes missing, and there's an odd 'dip' in the contour of the dark hover background near where the separator should be. Probably a border-radius thing on the individual parts of the button?

This doesn't work on Linux; maybe make it mac/windows only, either with an ifdef or by having it in both the windows and mac stylesheets? (I'd lean towards the ifdef)

This should be OS X only, so as not to break windows hidpi, I think
... or, of course, I could poke some more and find more OS X issues:

- the pinned tab glow is a little messed up on OS X as well
- opening customize mode makes the tabs jump down when using tabsintitlebar


I think at some point we should just start landing stuff and incrementally fix fallout. I am... honestly not quite sure what our odds are of having this polished and finished on aurora by nov. 10. :-(

That is actually on purpose - I bumped it down because otherwise there was nowhere on the window to drag it around while in customize mode.

Yes, if we get it landed we can start opening up more specific bugs and I can get some help

Is there a bug opened for not using moz-icon://stock/gtk-add?size=menu for the new tab button (as I mention in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1091711#c3)?

Not to mention that this is preffed off by default in nightly / m-c and won't change anything unless if you've set the pref.

So I actually wasn't planning on changing the platform-specific border radius for toolbarbuttons (3px on osx and 2px on windows/linux).  I guess that's a shorlander question.

This is already overridden in linux/devedition.css.  I'd rather not ifdef for this case (since we already have separate files for each platform and it'd be only one rule to duplicate anyway).  I could move it into the windows/osx files if you think that's better than just letting the linux file override it?

I mean, it's just ignored, not actually overridden (-moz-image-region vs. background-image)... for clarity's sake (my initial comment on the patch was "why does Linux have its own override for the selected tab case, when there's already one in shared?") I guess moving it would be preferable. :-)

I couldn't find any open bugs; bug 947356 looks like it could have addressed it, but didn't? I guess that with full black background, the blue of the default gtk icon provides enough contrast. On the other hand, the default "Space Fantasy" theme that we ship on beta+ is dark blue-ish, and the new tab button all but disappears in that.

Just like the toolbar buttons, I imagine we can just copy the windows file for the [+] icon to linux and apply the appropriate CSS for the inverted case.

Sounds good to me - can we do this in a new dark lw theme bug like for how we handled the download glow icon?

rgba(..., 1) should just be rgb(...), and please remove the spaces from within these color values. Also, why are you using the same value as the background color and for the background image (which isn't really a gradient but a solid background image)? Why set a background image at all here?

we can fix the devtools/lwtheme issue with the existing windows inverted asset. that can't be said for that bug, which is asking for updated linux assets, AFAICT.

I've commented in 940326 - I don't see any reason why we can't just use the windows icons in that bug instead of waiting for assets.

Thanks!  I left more comments on reviewboard, but I believe that I have fixes for the PB indicator, the black menu bar text, the non-disabled scroll arrows, and the window controls overlapping.  So I'm going to ask you for review on the windows/devedition.css file.

OK, I've added the following rules, which seem to make it work for Ambiance/Radiance themes on Ubuntu:

#toolbar-menubar {
  -moz-appearance: none;
}
#toolbar-menubar menubar {
  color: var(--chrome-color);
}
#toolbar-menubar menu:not([open]) {
  color: inherit;
}

I have a feeling it may be harder than this to cover all cases (go figure), so if it becomes a big change I'd like to do it in a follow up if you don't mind.

Removed the titlebar-content styling altogether - it isn't needed.  It fixes this problem.

Looks like any button in the navbar is getting the default hover state, which tbh doesn't look bad at all on the dark navbar besides that border radius.  I'll look at it in the meantime, but this is all non-default UI, so could this possibly be handled in a follow up?

It's because the bookmarks-item use -moz-appearance for styling.  I added a 'fix' that just copies the selector list for the toolbarbutton-1 styling, but I'm not sure if that's what we want to do long-term.

Just realized that this is the exact same problem with the nav-bar buttons also.  We could alternatively *not* set the text color on hover for the bookmarks buttons and just let the default styling take over as it does on lw themes

Yeah, so if in linux/devedition.css I add this rule instead:

/* Allow buttons with -moz-appearance set to look normal on hover and open states */
#navigator-toolbox toolbarbutton:not(.subviewbutton):-moz-any(:hover, [open="true"]) {
  color: initial;
}

Then this allows the normal hover / open effect (which on linux is using -moz-appearance).  I can then remove the huge duplicated selector list - I think this is better because it is consistent with how the other themes work on the linux platform.  If these buttons get custom styling at some point they can use the existing variables.  What do you think?

I was confused here when I was replied here because I misread this and I was adding the buttons to the *menu* bar, not the nav bar.   Now I see what you meant.  There are separate issues with it on the menu bar and the nav bar, but I'll focus first on fixing the nav bar since that is the default location.

I looked more into this - the 'dip' seems to be an issue even on stable Linux AFAICT.  It's just not as noticeable because you can actually see a border.  Currently, the --toolbarbutton-hover-bordercolor matches the --toolbarbutton-hover-bordercolor.  I could see updating the border color for all buttons to be a bit lighter than the hover color to make things look a little nicer for this case.

Yeah, I trust that this works, esp. after Dão's suggestions, and we can followup if necessary after landing this. Considering it's preffed off, and just CSS, I'm fairly happy just landing this in the state it's currently in.

Nit: By convention, we only modify things with .toolbarbutton-1 so add-ons can opt out of our styling. So we should be using that here. Unfortunately, that doesn't fix the bookmarks case, so we should add a selector for toolbarbutton.bookmark-item to this rule:

#navigator-toolbox .toolbarbutton-1:not(.subviewbutton):-moz-any(:hover, [open="true"]),
toolbarbutton.bookmark-item:not(.subviewbutton):-moz-any(:hover, [open="true"]) {

Still working on tracking down the leak.  It seems to be somewhere in the test, as this push doesn't leak: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=cc324f595384.  I've also tried commenting out the _positionPinnedTabs stuff, which didn't seem to make a difference.

This version removes the devedition styling when the devtools light theme is applied, switching to australis instead so it will match better.

FTR, the other test here that uses LWTManager is disabled in e10s... dunno if this needs the same treatment or not...

Otherwise, rs=me in terms of the update as compared to the previous patch, which is fairly trivial.

If this doesn't solve leaks yet, please give my suggestion on IRC (make styleSheet load handler the object with a handleEvent method, instead of a closure'd callback function, and always removeEventListener when deleting this.styleSheet) a shot. Might be worth doing anyway in terms of code simplicity.

That's weird, the only reason I could think of is that the devedition.theme.enabled pref isn't getting cleared at the end of the browser_devedition.js test, but I'm not seeing any warnings in the log.  Let me see if anything else sticks out as the cause.

I'm confused now.  On windows or osx, when running `./mach mochitest browser/base/content/test/general/browser_devedition.js --jsdebugger` and commenting out the finish() call in that test, you can see that the stylesheet is indeed gone at the end, but the browser is still dark!  Even if you go and toggle the pref while the test window is still opened the browser is still dark.  I don't know if the fact that it is running in the test harness is making the browser display not refresh when the stylesheet is removed?  This obviously works when running the browser.

I think this is going to take some more debugging so we should probably back this out in the meantime.  I'm going to do a try push with that test disabled in windows e10s just to make sure that this is the issue.

So skipping the browser_devedition test in e10s on windows fixes the error, but I don't understand why.  Here's a try push: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=70a8ffdb663d.  It seems the dark theme is still showing up after the test ends even though the stylesheet has been removed.  I will need to dig into further, but it's clearly not a problem when the browser is running (and only causing a test failure on windows-opt-e10s) so I'm tempted to just skip the test.

lwtheme-preview-listener.patch

So the leak from the previous test changes turned out to be due to making two calls to LWTManager.previewTheme in a row without calling resetTheme()[0].  In the process I tried doing a refactor that Gijs suggested (using handleEvent to make sure that we could always unbind the load handler for the style sheet).  This didn't fix the leaks [1], but I like it more than how it was being done before so I'm going to leave it.  Copying over r+ with the handleEvent changes since that was a simple refactor on Gijs' suggestion.

Here is a try push [2] that didn't leak, and one I just pushed [3] for good measure.

lwtheme-preview-listener.patch

OK, I think I've tracked this down, this patch should fix both the intermittent leak from the js changes (see Comment 290) and the weird windows e10s failure.

I think the call to manually set and reset general.skins.selectedSkin in the browser_devedition.js test was messing things up.  Removing those calls locally the 'sticky' styling problem goes away, so I'm fairly sure that it will resolve the problem.  It's not an important part of the test (it was kind of left over from when I had a listener for the theme changing), so I just removed it.

Pushed to try with both patches: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=522a448c8ed2

So can it never happen in the real world that we fire two previewTheme calls without a resetPreview inbetween? I'm a little confused that this would throw anything off...

It seems that resetPreview is typically called before previewTheme is called again.  For instance, within customize mode the previewTheme is called on focus / mouseover and resetPreview is called on blur / mouseout [0].  The addon manager always calls resetPreview [1].  I think it's safe to say that there is no other cases in test coverage that call it this way, since removing the usage here stops the leak.

I don't completely understand why calling two previews in a row is an issue on Windows debug builds, but when I looked into the lwtmanager code it is not doing the exact same thing in between these two cases.  In the previewTheme with an existing previewTimer it just calls _previewTimer.cancel() [2] instead of resetPreview() which also nulls it out and notifies windows [3].

The weird thing is that it really should make no difference at all as far as the devedition listener is concerned.  The consequence of the different behavior from the above paragraph is that we have a sequence of events like this:

// No resetPreview
previewTheme("preview0");
observe {"id":"preview0"} -> call _toggleStyleSheet(false)
previewTheme("preview1");
observe {"id":"preview1"} -> call _toggleStyleSheet(false)

Instead of:

// With resetPreview
previewTheme("preview0");
{"id":"preview0"} -> call _toggleStyleSheet(false)
resetPreview()
null -> call _updateStyleSheetFromPrefs() which will toggleStyleSheet(true/false)
previewTheme("preview1");
{"id":"preview1"} -> call _toggleStyleSheet(false)

But if you look at the code in devedition.js it's clear that doing two previews in a row the second _toggleStyleSheet won't do anything.

For instance, on this push [4], I added consecutive previewTheme() calls in the test, but did it when PREF_DEVEDITION_THEME was false, which made the devedition stuff only call _toggleStyleSheet(false) a bunch of different times in a row, but it still leaks.

And the most clear reduced test case that I can find to reproduce the leak: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a93c88e77c75.  In this changeset (https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/467f9665f4ba) I remove everything that devedition does except for adding / removing an observer for lightweight-theme-styling-update.  The test is reduced to doing subsequent calls to previewTheme and returning with an ok(true).  And the push is leaking just the same as the patch with the full devedition machinery.

With this in mind, I'm going to reland the patches.

What the heck is that? :/ dummyLightweightTheme("{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}") certainly isn't the default theme.
