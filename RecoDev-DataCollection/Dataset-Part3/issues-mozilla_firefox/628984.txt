Kind of silly, looks like it's just an <img> tag. We should fix this test to use the test server, and load this from http://mochi.test or example.com.

hCard uses:

Indeed, the test doesn't mind at all.

Need to land it on 1.9.2 and 1.9.1 too, sometime earlier in a day.
Pushed to 1.9.2:
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/rev/71139309b45d

I had to change the hostname in the image URL from mochi.test to localhost, since the mochi.test changes didn't land on 1.9.2.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.
