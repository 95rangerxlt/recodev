After bug 337725 landed, the search engine selection icon is completely missing from the search box in trunk builds. If you happen to click in exactly the right spot, you can still access the menu, but the grippy/triangle isn't there. 

jminta thinks that the new icon is only built without places, so we should see about moving the icon into a new location.

use places icon

Patch uses a Places icon if MOZ_PLACES is defined.
joey, what do you think of doing it this way instead?

.search-go-button .toolbarbutton-menubutton-dropmarker {
%ifdef MOZ_PLACES
  list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/places/folderDropArrow.png") !important;
%else
  list-style-image: url("chrome://browser/skin/bookmarks/folderarrow.png") !important;
%endif
}
