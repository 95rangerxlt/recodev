Phoenix crashes directly on startup when it opens over my xterm and I was typing
something while it loaded.  This does not appear to happen if I was only typing
letters and numbers, but if I type return or an arrow key right when the window
appears.  The window then appears, thinks for a second or two, and then the
whole app crashes, taking down all of the icons from the web pages in the
bookmarks (which by the way I find _highly_ annoying and it deserves a bug
report in it's own right).  This would not bother me if there was a way to tell
Phoenix to start in the upper right corner, but Phoenix (bug three!) ignores
-geometry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start phoenix
2. keep pressing return or the arrow up key while it loads so that the new
window (your window manager needs to give it focus for this to work) receives
the events while phoenix is loading


Actual Results:  
*boom* *crash* *burn*

Expected Results:  
not crash and burn

I am using the default theme.

Please note that I cvs updated my phoenix yesterday and rebuilt it as well.  The
fact that the user agent string reports a version from over a month ago is also
a bug in Phoenix (let's call it bug 4).

Felix, please file seperate bug reports for different bugs - that makes it
easier to help you out...

As I haven't got Linux I can't try to reproduce your problem, but the problem
with your UA is very strange! I just remember bug #203607 or bug #203606 where
your UA seemed to be messed up, too and your problems went away just because of
nothing - so perhaps it would be a good idea to just download the compiled linux
binaries and install them together with a fresh profile and to give it a try -
just to make sure the problems aren't caused by your CVS environment!

btw: how does Mozilla react on this "typing during loading"? Ah, and for the
"-geometry"-thing there have been some bugs filed already : see bug #20573 and
bug #33378
mozilla does not trigger this bug for me because my X window manager asks me to
place that window, so I can't type into it by surprise.  I'm using fvwm2, btw.

My guess is that this is about a race condition in the history.  I see the
crashing most often with the up arrow.  My wild speculation is that phoenix gets
the keyboard events and tries to go up in the URL history but that is not
initialized or something.  That ought to be easy to rule out or confirm by
someone who knows that piece of code in the mozilla sources, right?
=> adding keyword 'crash' and CCing David, as I know he's using Linux, too, so
perhaps he's got the time to have a look on it...
Reporter:
Can you still reproduce with recent nightly build of Mozilla Firebird?
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/nightly/latest-trunk/
Looks like reporter hasn't responded in 30 days. I'm going to close this bug as
invalid for now, since we don't have a reproduction report for a nightly.

Reporter (felix-mozilla): Feel free to reopen the bug if you reproduce it in a
nightly.

I just confirmed the bug is also present in the current nightly build of
phoenix^WFirebird.
Works for me:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030910 Firebird/0.6.1+

What I did was
1. Opened an xterm
2. Typed "MozillaFirebird&" at the bash prompt
3. As soon as I hit enter, started hitting a key or keys, until Mozilla
Firebird was up and running.

I repeated steps 2 and 3 hitting enter repeatedly, hitting up arrow repeatedly,
and hitting the up then the down arrow repeatedly.  I tried it in KDE3.1 and in
fvwm2.  

Reporter, is there anything I should be doing differently to try to reproduce
this?
try not typing abcd but keys like the arrow keys or return.
I don't know if it works with KDE, I use fvwm.
I tried it with both arrow keys and the return key, on both KDE and fwvm2, and
could not reproduce it.
I can reproduce it every time.

Run MozillaFirebird.  Since this is such bloated monster software, it takes a
noticeable amount of time even on my Athlon XP 2000+ between the first outline
of the phoenix window being displayed and the full window display with menus and
bookmarks.  During that time, press Return with the focus on the phoenix window.
 phoenix will then continue loading and crash immediately after it is finished
loading and the window display is done.

My home page is about:blank.  Maybe it's a GTK2 port issue?
> Maybe it's a GTK2 port issue?

That's possible. You've been using one of the non-mozilla.org GTK2/XFT ports?

I believe that since September 1st the nightlies on mozilla.org have been built
with GTK2/XFT. Are you using those, or are you using a non-mozilla.org one?

If you're using a non-mozilla.org one, try the mozilla.org nightly and report
back if it works properly.

Also, I know that this is a bit tough, but would it be possible to try another
window manager and see if it happens there? (Also, by "fvwm" do you mean fvwm
2.x or are you actually using a 1.x?)

Felix:  Is this still a problem?
apparently fixed in current cvs
