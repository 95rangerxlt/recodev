hi adam,
We are making a big push to try and get as many extensions as possible working for the upcoming release of  Firefox 2 in a few weeks.  Do you know if this extension will be compatible and ready to work with Firefox 2?
Added to the umo review queue.
It's been approved :)
Version 9.8.1 is compatible with Firefox 2.0.
