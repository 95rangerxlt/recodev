The lock icons in the new fullscreen notification design, as well as their position and size are necessary for continuing the work on implementing the new design.

It seems I can reuse the icons in browser/themes/shared/controlcenter directly, which is also good for consistency. But what icon should be shown in what condition is still a question though.
Hmm, probably no. The color seems to be different from the design. It may still need independent artifacts. But those icons are probably useful for you as a reference.
Verdi sent me email said that we should just use the icons from control center with a different fill color.
