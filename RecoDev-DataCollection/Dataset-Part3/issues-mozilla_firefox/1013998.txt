Seems like Gaia renders the app icons with a bit of shadow so they stand up from the background even when it's bright too. But the AppManager doesn't, so it's hard to see in this case.

What should we do about that? Quite annoying.
Should we change the icons use by the templates?
Can't we render a shadow like Gaia do? That would make any icon "white background proof".
I tried shadows. In many ways. But:
1) it's hard to build a shadow that works for any icon shape
2) it's hard to figure out the right color of the shadow

Basically, it's very hard to build a shadow that would work for any icon.

We will have to create better icons. I'll give it a try.

These icons follow the style of normal gaia apps (here, I use the standard white background).
It's not perfect, there's still a lack of contrast with the mac toolbar.

I was thinking about using a much brighter color.

Using the standard orange we find in some gaia icons (like the Email app). I think this is better.

Ohh that's a neat idea. And it would match the style of Gaia too. Brilliant!

Do you have the hex gradient colours, or even better, the gradient as an SVG? I would like to apply these changes to the original SVG files and then re-render the PNGs.

These SVG are included with each app, e.g.: https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-privileged-remote-app/blob/master/img/icons/icon.svg

I don't. I just picked the color from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/master/apps/email/style/icons/email_126.png
OK let me see if I can find the sources or I will just update the SVGs and regenerate them.

New icon in place

I pinged Patryk and etc and I got some gradients we can use. I updated the two apps:
https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-privileged-remote-app/commit/67dd9b8aa45f8db8be5e111ef15c3a6ae7016d63
https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-privileged-empty-app/commit/7c6ceb27492bba545d3b109419244fa49d22aac7

They definitely can be seen now in WebIDE!

r-'ing since we got colours from UX
Looks good to me. Can you propagate the changes to http://code.cdn.mozilla.net/templates/list.json too?
I see the new icon in the zip, but the old icon in the json.
Me too. If I download it from the admin side of S3 I do get the updated version so I don't understand what is going on-the HTTP headers say that it was last modified 18 Jun which is not the case. Let me ping the person in charge of the CDN :)
Any update?
Appears to be fixed for me. Should we close this bug?
Sole?
I consider this bug fixed.
Me too!
