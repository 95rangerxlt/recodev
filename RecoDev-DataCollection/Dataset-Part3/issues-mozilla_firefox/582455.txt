Proposed patch.

The image on the grippy on the Web Console is currently overlaid on top of the knob, which looks strange on Mac and Windows. Also, the cursor changes to the "hand" cursor while over the grippy, which is, IMHO, less appropriate than the "ns-resize" cursor.

The attached patch fixes these issues. It touches only the CSS.

Because this is a serious UI issue that could confuse users, I'd like to request that it block the Firefox 4 release.

Sounds like you really want to just take out the grippy instead of covering up its effects. cf the (grippy-less) splitters in the Page Info dialog, the one used for the sidebars, the one in Library, etc.. Grippies aren't really used in Firefox. In fact, after a quick search on MXR, it seems grippies aren't used in mozilla-central *at all*.

I'm aware that SeaMonkey uses them quit a bit, but the code in question is also m-c.  Although, if this is going to see reuse in SeaMonkey, it might be appropriate to use a grippy and use a rule in the Firefox skin to make it "display: none;", which effectively amounts to "tak[ing] it out" there.
I'm joking. By all means take it out since Firefox will be the primary consumer. I'm sure we'll somehow manage.

[checked-in] Proposed patch, version 2.

New patch removes the grippy.

This causes a regression in that the splitter can no longer be double-clicked in order to collapse it. However, based on what I gathered from ddahl, the collapsing behavior was never considered to be final. Patches to enable more sensible collapsing behavior are forthcoming, and will be linked to from this bug.
