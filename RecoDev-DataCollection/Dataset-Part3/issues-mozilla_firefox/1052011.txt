Bug 1037162 introduces a bunch of UI elements into doorhangers that haven't been used there so far. We should give this a visual design pass to make sure they look right.

First design pass for the Sharing Permissions UI:

Assigning Philipp for design review.
Thanks Michael! Most of this looks great! I just have a few nits/questions/remarks:

1. In security review, there has been talk about blue not being »intimidating« enough. Since the new indicator is much more visible in general, I don't think it should be a concern anymore though.

2. There's currently no visual difference between combo boxes and button/dropdown combinations (Allow/Deny/Mute). It should be clear that the latter have a one-click action. It's buttons like these I'm talking about: http://cl.ly/image/2z2F0D1B1z3p

3. Should the »Details« control have any indication or hover effect to mark it as an interactive element?

4. When highlighting a screen, it's not possible to draw a border outside of the screen content ;)

5. The »Share selected devices« button in panel 4 should be disabled since no device is selected in the state shown.

From here on it's more about consistency in the mockup:

6. In panel 3, the microphone icon in the global indicator should have the strikethrough as well since it is muted (like in panel 9)

7. Panel 8 seems to have the wrong headline (should be the same as in panel 9)

8. Panels 8 and 9 show the wrong state in the global indicator. In 8, all icons should be active and in 9, all panels should be non-dimmed with the microphone having a strike through.

9. The close button of the panel has different alignments in various panels and is missing entirely from some of them.

and the button label should be "Unmute" rather than "Mute".
Thanks for the feedback, Philipp.

The mock below addresses the feedback from comment 2 and 3.

Thanks Michael!
One final thing about the disabling of the »Share« button when no screen is selected:
Acutally, just the button-portion of the control is disabled. The dropdown should still work since it contains the option to not share a screen (which is something the user still can do).
Updated the button-portion of the control.
