After a crash with 2 tabs opened, all bookmarks in Bookmarks Toolbar Items disappeared. Restarted several times, but could not retrieve the missing bookmarks, not even in safe mode.

I removed bookmarks_history.sqlite and I got bookmarks from bookmark toolbars back. However, all recent changes are lost (the last month or so)

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks shouldn't be lost.

I haven't got the talkback ID, however the pages I browsed was http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=1045792&TopOfYest=yes and http://www1.appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/sec_main.cfm

I forgot to add: I was unable to add new bookmarks in the toolbar either. Not until I deleted bookmarks_history.sqlite
-> Moving to Firefox/Places

blocks bug 328101 ?
This should be fixed

feel free to reopen if it hasn't
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
