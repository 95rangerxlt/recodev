The logs for the sidebar end up in the readinglist "sync" logs (which seems fine) although they are a bit noisy.  This patch changes some log.debug calls to log.trace calls (.trace calls will *not* end up in these logs by default)

While you are at it, please fix this to say "selectedItem" instead of "activeItem". I guess this was a copy/paste mistake initially.
