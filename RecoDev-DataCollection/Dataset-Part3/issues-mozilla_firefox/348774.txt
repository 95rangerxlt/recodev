patch coming
Ugh. Access key magic might make this a pain in the pane (har, har). I'll look at this when I'm done my blocker bugs.
k so this creates a need for a new access key as it was using the x in Extensions.  With a bit of shifting I've come up with a suggestion that kills two birds with one stone.  The i on Verification in the Encryption tab isn't clear, looked to me like it was f.

So, in Updates "(I)nstalled Add-ons"
in General "Search for te(x)t when I begin typing"
and in Encryption "View Certificate(s)" and "(V)erification"

In the future we should really make new strings that use b, j, q, and z to expand our options ;)
ok so I was going off of old screenshots and the i thing isn't a problem anymore.  My original irc suggestion of "Search for te(x)t" and "Installed Add-on(s)" works

s/Extensions and Themes/Add-ons

In Advanced/Encryption prefpanel there are two references to "Extensions and Themes". This changes those to use the new term "Add-ons", and also does an accesskey shuffle x->n (by changing the existing n->V, V->s and s->x)
(Scott, you might want to do something similar for Thunderbird 2.0)

Drivers: another string change, I think it's low risk enough to even warrant a cross-commit to trunk and branch, and am taking the somewhat untraditional action of requesting a? at the same time as r?

a=dbaron on behalf of drivers.  Please land on MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH and add the fixed1.8.1 keyword once you have done so.

Thanks for the heads up Mike! I filed Bug 348897 to track this for Thunderbird.
Checked in on the branch, leaving open for trunk checkin once the trunk reopens.

Should the second "add-ons" have a capital A?
