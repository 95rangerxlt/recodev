Chris tells me that you're on the hook for finalizing (with John) the list of en-US RSS handlers for en-US.

Please let me know when that process is finished.  As soon as we have that list, we can notify localizers of their duties.

The feed readers for en-US will be, in order:

- Bloglines
- My Yahoo
- Google Reader

Localizers may substitute Google Personalized Home Page if they wish, since Google Reader is not widely (maybe not at all?) localized.

If you wish to make other changes to the list of feed readers for your locale, please file an approval bug, per the L10n Requirements document at http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2/L10n_Requirements
I can't reopen and assign to someone else in one step -- hooray for Bugzilla!
We still need to update the en-US list in CVS, for which I nominate Axel.  This is the new correctly-ordered and -named list:

browser.contentHandlers.types.0.title=Bloglines
browser.contentHandlers.types.0.uri=http://www.bloglines.com/login?r=/sub/%s
browser.contentHandlers.types.1.title=My Yahoo
browser.contentHandlers.types.1.uri=http://add.my.yahoo.com/rss?url=%s
browser.contentHandlers.types.2.title=Google Reader
browser.contentHandlers.types.2.uri=http://fusion.google.com/add?feedurl=%s
Nominating to block release, unless Axel thinks we need it in by beta, but I'm thinking we don't need these lists that urgently just yet. Axel?

fix the order, rename "Google" to "Google Reader", set unchanged

Not really sure why this would be assigned to me, but whatever.

We only need this for B2 if the order of the readers blocks release, or the name change to Google. Feel free to take any landing buddy for this patch you can get.
