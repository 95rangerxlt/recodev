This must be intermittent, since the previous test run was green with the same changeset.

Copying Ehsan since he wrote the test, and mconnor since he reviewed it - this is a frequent intermittent orange - is there a real problem here, or just a faulty test?

SynthesizeKey on Linux has focus issues, see bug 495751.
if you see above the test failed only on Linux, and i can see why since it uses a bunch of synthesizeKey. Actually putting a window.focus() and focusing the textbox COULD be enough, but no reasons really, value is just working the same way.

patch v1.0

The window probably doesn't have focus, and making sure it does (by explicitly focusing it) should make sythesizeKey work.
Yes, but still focus on Linux is still bogus, and i really think we should not make browser-chrome tests that depends on focus if we don't really need.

i cannot guarantee this will work as reliably as patch v1.0, i still think that is the right way to go. But if we want to try focus fix first, here it is.

Yes, I'd prefer to try this first as it's more like what the user would actually do.

Actually, reading bug 495751 and bug 497839, it seems that window.focus might sometimes work asynchronously.  Given that, and the fact that the synthesizeKey calls in this test are merely an attempt at imitating the real user as much as possible and don't really have any special value to the test at hand, I would prefer the first approach in order to avoid any possible similar problems in the future.

Testing that focusing a text box and synthesizing keyboard events to it has the same effect as setting its value property should be a test in the XUL widget code, and it's not too important to worry about it here.

Given bug 495751, this is bound to cause further intermittent oranges.

Marco, please proceed to land this when the tree reopens.
thank you.
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a1de621405d2
Thanks for picking this up!  This needs to land on 1.9.1 as well.
oh. i thought test was not active there. i don't see failures on 1.9.1 above
I suspect that the test failures happen by something done by other tests.  I am suspecting the cert exceptions test which opens up dialogs, and hence changes the focus.  I'd rather land this now and avoid future oranges than wait till we see oranges on 1.9.1 and then land it there.

this failure is not relevat, it is on the push that created the 3.6a1 branch, and it's based on a changeset that is older than the fix for this test.
