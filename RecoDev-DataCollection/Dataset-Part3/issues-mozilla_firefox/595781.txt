Are you using the newer version?
http://crashme.googlecode.com/files/crashme-new.xpi

The old version will not work with the 4.0 betas due to some XPCOM changes.
(FWIW, crash reporting works fine for me on all platforms.)

To be sure, I downloaded also from here. On what build have you tested on ?
Okay, I just tested in the latest nightly (20100913) on Linux, and I get the following in the error console:
Error: __LOCATION__ is not defined
Source File: resource://crashme/Crasher.jsm
Line: 17

Looks like something broke __LOCATION__ in JavaScript modules, which is breaking "Crash Me Now!".
Oh, I'm an idiot. bug 533038 comment 142 explains it. I need to fix "Crash Me Now!"
Okay, I've uploaded a new version which fixes this.
