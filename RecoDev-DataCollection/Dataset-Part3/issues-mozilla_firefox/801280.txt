Update pdf.js to version 0.6.2

Only a few minor things here but I'd like to see follow-up before it lands.

You're not removing the same event listener here as the one added is that returned by bind(). I don't think this will leak as the content window is going away at this point anyway but either correct it or just remove this useless call.

The confusing variable names is ... confusing. Please just use this.types.length, it's cheap enough to not optimise it unnecessarily.

Is there any point in doing this if supportsIntegratedFind is false?

This is going to re-set pdf.js as the default handler even for users who have turned that off in the past right?

Correct, we wanted to reset this since pdf.js went to the beta version but was disabled.

Brendan, I'm assuming you'll handle the aurora uplift nomination.

Tim: thanks for spotting that. That is a little unfortunate. I've opened bug 806329 to get this fixed.
