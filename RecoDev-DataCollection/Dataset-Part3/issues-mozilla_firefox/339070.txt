patch

I forgot to set the defaults for their creation in the app specific file
Forgot to mention, I removed the commented out flash player copying that was duplicated from the XPInstall based installer. I talked with jst about this and it isn't needed for newer version of flash. I also added compreg.dat and xpti.dat to the uninstall.log along with explicitly removing defaults\shortcuts.

btw: I talked with jst about getting quicktime to also use the reg keys for plugin detection and we have had no success in getting them to add them. I'll bring this up to schrep after he gets back.
Checked in to trunk and MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH
