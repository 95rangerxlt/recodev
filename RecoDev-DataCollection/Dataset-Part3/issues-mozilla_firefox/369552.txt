This is needed on the branch.
rstrong: Would this cause the Program to hang around in Add/Remove Programs even after you run the uninstaller? Just want to make sure that bug is covered since both juanb and I have seen it on Vista and XP.
Yes

I'm going to double check a couple of things before request a1.8.1.2
fwiw:

I just verified this fix with robert's new.exe

with his 98.exe (an old build from him), the program hangs around on vista after uninstall.  when uninstalling, I see the short path in the uninstall UI.

but, with his new.exe (a new build from him with this fix), the program doesn't hang around on vista after uninstall.  when uninstalling, I see the full path in the uninstall UI.

note to robert:  trying 98.exe on my windows xp machine (which does not have your fix), after uninstalling the app, I do not see the program hanging around in Add/Remove Programs on windows XP.  (note, marcia did in comment #4).

There was a long delay, but as soon as the add/remove programs dialog came back, the program was no longer listed.

It also needs to uppercase the path since the compare is case sensitive on the branch. This did remove the values in startmenuinternet and uninstall.

note to robert:  fwiw, your new2.exe doesn't seem to have the long delay.  but the add/remove programs dialog can be slow, so your mileage may vary.
