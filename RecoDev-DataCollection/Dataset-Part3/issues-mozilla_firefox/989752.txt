The following strings, displayed when opening the Dev toolbar then running "help" command, are still displayed in English in localized builds.

The first string (1) has been added to l10n files when bug 933727 has landed, but is only used in the first-run pop-up (appears translated), while the string is also displayed in the help command pop-up (appears in English).

The second string (2) has *not* been added to l10n files yet, and is already in Aurora (string frozen).

(1) GCLI is an experiment to create a highly usable command line for web developers.

(2) Useful links: Source (Apache-2.0), Documentation (for users/embedders), Mozilla feature page (for GCLI in the web console).
