It is certainly not "nice" if favicons are grabbed when the Permission Manager is entered (Bug 658615).

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 658615 ***
Actually, this is asking for the *opposite* of Bug 658615.
This seems to be a problem with the favicon service API. What we really want is an API method that just returns locally stored favicon data if we have it, and does not try to connect to the host otherwise. It looks like this method exists in nsIFaviconService, but not mozIAsyncFavicons, so perhaps we need to add a new async method to do this?

I'm cc'ing Marco, since he knows more about the favicon service.
can you just use a moz-anno:favicon:pageurl src for the icon?

I wasn't aware that this was a way to get what I wanted. With this patch I'm not seeing any more network activity, but I'm still seeing favicons, so it solves the problem!

per IRC discussion, this is fine, but adds 2 queries.  You should fire the https request before the http one, and ignore an eventual second callback if both exist.

you can use gFaviconService.getFaviconLinkForIcon(aURI) to get automatically a moz-anno:favicon nsIURI (it just does the string concat practically)

gFaviconService should also be QI to Ci.mozIAsyncFavicons (you can .getService().QueryInterface() to get both)
nevermind QI, it's not needed, gavin pointed out we implement classinfo there, I honestly didn't recall :(

nit: this comment looks a bit ambiguous, may get some love.
