I haven't been able to isolate under what conditions this happens, but I find that the last character of the names of my tab groups disappears. It seems to happen singularly rather than in bulk, and I _think_ it only happens after I've edited a name (eg, upon creation). However, the loss doesn't appear instantly - I usually don't notice until I've gone into a tab group, and backed back out to the Tab Group UI.

Very strange, I just reproduced it. Will try to get an STR.
STR:

1) Drag to create a new group
2) Enter its title
3) When entering the last letter keep the key pressed and click outside the group while the key is held down (those two actions must occur pretty quickly)
4) Restart Firefox and notice that the last letter wasn't saved

Explanation: We save the title on every mouseup-event (which is not fired for the last letter with the given STR).
