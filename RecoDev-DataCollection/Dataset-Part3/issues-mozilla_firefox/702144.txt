Thanks for the bug report!

This looks like it works fine in Firefox 10+ with Orion enabled.

Presumably this will be a problem in Firefoxes 8-10 with the text-based source editor in place.

orion 11

In 8, 9, 10, 11 - same too.
Strange. I'm unable to reproduce this with your attached text on my machine in OS X.

Can anyone with a Windows machine try this out?
Not all the characters are displaying for me either.

Copying and pasting works fine. The script file also displays properly in Dashcode

convert input to UTF-8

I copied the code from exportToFile and it appears to work. We may be able to remove the manual conversion once bug 655658 lands.

convert input to UTF-8 v2

We probably want to pass the unicode version of the content to the callback. Stupid mistake
Will be implemented by the wrap of long lines in scratchpad (style editor and other) and file://, ftp://, http://, https://, etc protocols (in default or checkbox in settings)?

convert input to UTF-8 v2

this looks like it should do the trick.
Hmmm, looking at the documentation again. I'm not sure if converter.Finish() needs to be called when converting to unicode. It seems to work fine without it. Does anyone have more experience with nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter?

convert input to UTF-8 v3

Remove the Finish() call since it is only needed for ConvertFromUnicode() and not ConvertToUnicode()

I need help landing the patch on m-c
