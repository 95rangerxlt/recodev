Patch

When adding or disabling tests within browser/base/content/test/ it can become quite a pain because there is a complete lack of order within the list of tests. There are also complementary test files sprinkled throughout the list of actual tests.

Personally, this has caused me enough loss of time that I think it is a worthwhile change to make given that we will lose a bit of hg blame functionality. Devs can just blame the parent of this changeset, so only one more hurdle, and not to mention many of the test files include a bug number with them so blaming Makefile.in isn't such a useful practice anyways.

LGTM. Let's hope we don't introduce new oranges, I don't think tests currently are as independent from their ordering as we'd like them to be.

The running order depends on the file names and is independent from the order in Makefile.in.
Right, I completely forgot that although I just saw it when running tests in that directory :|
