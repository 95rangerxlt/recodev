Singular and Plural? Oh, if only it was so simple!

You'll be wanting to fix this in a followup. :)

I think this should be fixed before landing that patch, actually...
We certainly need this in before strings freeze, but I would like to keep the reviewing simple and land this in 2 patches if possible.
I have updated the CssHtmlTree patch. The change was sufficiently simple and I could implement this today.

You can mark this bug as fixed, if the changes I did are sufficient. Otherwise, please let me know what needs to be improved. Thanks!
