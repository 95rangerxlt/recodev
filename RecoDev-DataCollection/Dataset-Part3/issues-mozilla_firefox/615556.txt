When closing two or more adjoining unselected tabs, the closed tab will move left and overlap onto the one left to it near the end of the animation. 

(Might be that unselected tabs don't have a background color, but I think it shouldn't even move left.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up at least three tabs.
2. Focus the rightmost one so that the 1st and 2nd tab remain inactive.
3. Close the 2nd tab and watch the animation.

Another scenario: 
1. Open up enough tabs so that they stack up and start to shrink in width.
2. Focus any tab other than the last two.
3. Close the rightmost one.

Why does pinstripe need a different offset for the opacity transition? If this works better, wouldn't it work better for other themes too?

Probably. I didn't just want to overwrite the numbers you came up with in bug 604735 because I've only tested it on Mac. But I guess there's not much I can break here.
