Steps to reproduce:
1. Middle-click on an unvisited link

Expected: link changes color to indicate that it's been visited.

Result: have to reload for color to change.

Regression window (firefox trunk on winxp):
works:  02/10

Seing this as well with official zip build 20040213, Windows XP.
This happens on Linux as well for me with Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;
en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040214 Firebird/0.8.0+.  Does it happen on Mac OS too? 
Perhaps OS should be set to All.
Fixed.
re-fixed, see bug 236394.
