My main suspect is bug 1067337, but Eddy is bisecting now and should have results soon.

Boo!
This test wasn't failing when I pushed to try. Looks like something changed in the meantime.
The difference is that on Gum MOZ_DEV_EDITION is defined.

That's even weirder. Why would this pass locally then? Anyway, I'm taking this.
Make sure you are building locally with this in your mozconfig:

ac_add_options --enable-update-channel=nightly-gum

Or even with s/nightly-gum/aurora/.

Thanks for taking this. Would you be so kind to ping me on irc when you're about to land the fix on gum?
I managed to reproduce the test failure locally with the mozconfig line from comment 22. I've pushed the following patch to gum:
https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/gum/rev/527e37564f9d

This should take care of the problem. I only tested locally, but since the patch only affects the test, it should be safe to skip testing the patch on try.

So essentially, this failed on gum, didn't fail on fx-team because no DEVEDITION thing is defined... won't this fail on aurora when we do define that thing there? Shouldn't we push the same change to fx-team and ensure it gets uplifted, too?
This very similar to the fix I was going to land, as per the changes I made in a similar test for bug 1067337: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f3cc40b3abf2#l5.199 Looks like Eddy beat me to it :)

The plan is to eventually merge gum back into aurora, in which case this problem should resolve itself, no?

Either way, this still needs to land on m-c.

What Brian said. But also, I asked this only last week and was specifically told this was not the plan, so I'm now very confused.

Also, and I'm sorry for the impression of stop energy / bad cop here... but ideally the test change should get review. :-)

*looks*

Consider this comment r+ from me, but please factor out the expression for the expected number of placeholders into a variable (like, say, "expectedPlaceholders") and use that in the comparison.

Ugh. No offense, but complaining about style nits in a 2 line fix in a test *does* sound like spending energy on the wrong things.

I already pushed the patch to gum, so if you really feel strongly about this, I can cook up another patch that fixes the style nits, push that to gum, and then push both patches to m-c tomorrow.

Landing non-obvious test changes without review is something I think we should avoid; that the result of the review was just style nits is orthogonal to that.

As far as I'm concerned, there's no need to "fix" gum for the style nits considering it's already landed. But for what you land on fx-team, I don't think fixing it is that much to ask - it's essentially what would have happened if you attached a patch and requested review before landing!


I'd still love to have more clarity on whether or not we intend to merge gum to aurora.

That is the plan, so we do need to make sure things that stick there are reviewed.

The reason for landing this on Gum immediately was to confirm that it fixed the tests before asking for review.  And it was a simple enough patch that I assumed we could back it out and reland if it needed changes.  This made sense to me at the time but as I think about it more, I wonder if we could just use Try from a local Gum build.  This would get the same effect without needing to use Gum as a test server.  Here is a sample push with nothing else in the queue: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=8bcd65367907, and one with the patch that landed on gum applied: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=01653f6fc82b.  But I'm not completely sure if that's working as I hope, since the second push doesn't show the original changesets.

Ok. I can agree with that. I felt the change was small enough that I could afford a r=me. In hindsight though, since it's not obvious why the change is needed it might have been better to ask for a proper review. I'll keep that in mind in the future.

That's fair enough.

FWIW, the second push doesn't show the original changeset because you already pushed those to try with your first attempt. TBPL only shows newly introduced commits with each push.

I didn't lie last week, there was a change of plans yesterday :)
Although if we manage to get every necessary patch in Aurora through the usual route, which is still our regular M.O., we may have nothing left to merge in the end.

OK, the push looks green - I'm going to proceed with landing other patches on gum, but we should come back tomorrow and backout / reland this in whatever form is going to land on m-c.

Fix for permaorange for both m-c and gum

I've backed out the fix locally and prepared a new patch, with review comments bij Gijs addressed, that should be able to land on both m-c and gum. Putting it up for review here just in case Gijs wants to take another look at it.
