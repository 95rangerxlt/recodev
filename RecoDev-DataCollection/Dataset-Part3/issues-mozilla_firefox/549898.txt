Hmmmm, WFM with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a3pre) Gecko/20100303 Minefield/3.7a3pre ID:20100303040025
I'm using Aero if that makes a difference
Also a Windows DPI of 120
OK... it appears using 120 DPI is causing my problem.  I use 120 because I have a 24" widescreen LCD.  Using 96dpi is not an option for me.
Yes, that seems to be it. With 125dpi I see the location bar increase.
It's not just the DPI that does it.  I went down to 96dpi and then changes the font sizes in Windows 7 from the default of 9 to 11.  This also causes the location bar to change height.
