I recommend WONTFIX. Flat chrome is for debugging, and we shouldn't be packing it up for any reason I can think of.

Localizers who don't have compile environment may want to make langpack, while flat chrome is better for debugging than jar chrome.

This does not work with installers-AB_CD.

Should not remove AB_CD.manifest, just not packaging.

r=me, putting this on ted's and bhearsum's radar, too.

Single line nod-off review should be good enough.

I don't understand the details of constructing a langpack, but I don't see how this would break anything.

Carrying over review because it's just synced with 1.9.1.
Requesting approval for 1.9.1.

As the patch shows, the 1.9.1 tree never regressed, so there's no reason to land this on 1.9.1

The changed lines are same between the trunk patch and the branch patch.
trunk:
-	  $(ZIP) -r9D $(LANGPACK_FILE) install.rdf chrome/$(AB_CD).jar chrome.manifest
+	  $(ZIP) -r9D $(LANGPACK_FILE) install.rdf chrome chrome.manifest -x chrome/$(AB_CD).manifest

1.9.1 branch:
-	  $(ZIP) -r9D $(LANGPACK_FILE) install.rdf chrome/$(AB_CD).jar chrome.manifest
+	  $(ZIP) -r9D $(LANGPACK_FILE) install.rdf chrome chrome.manifest -x chrome/$(AB_CD).manifest

This was regressed on 2008-10-20, which was before branching on 2008-11-29.
Need to land also on 1.9.1 because the regression has been branched.
