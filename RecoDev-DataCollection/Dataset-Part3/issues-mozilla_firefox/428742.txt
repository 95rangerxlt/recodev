Recent attempts to fix the multiple tabs close warning issues have led to another problem.

I've configured Firefox to "show my windows and tabs from last time" when it starts. Yet, when I try to close Firefox, I am now asked if I want to save windows and tabs. So, now Firefox acts like someone with memory problems (besides leaks) and/or trust issues. I was specific and certain when I "told" it to "show my windows and tabs from last time" when it starts, and I don't want to be asked this question again. Well, maybe when I set an option "I am not sure anymore" or something like that, current behavior would be justified.

The situation seems simple to me: 
- if said "show tabs and windows from last time", do it without confirming every time.
- if I said "warm me before closing multiple tabs/windows", do it.

Reproducible: Always

I always have problems with this feature. For me it doesn't even ask me at all it just closes the window whether or not I have tabs open. Without saving them or asking me if I want to save.

Do you think this might be a Windows Vista only problem?

What build do you have? This has been "fixed" very recently (bug 419009). And you have to set certain preferences.
My tabs and windows have been saved and reopened (I set this in the Main tab in the pref dialog). My issue now is with the text and logic of the current warning dialog. It should simply ask if I really want to close 120 tabs that I have open :)

Confirming, because of superfluous "Quit" dialog when session restore is already the expected behaviour. This regressed on 10 Apr 2008, possibly from Bug 419009.
This was an intentional change from bug 419009. You can disable the quit prompt by disabling the "warn me when closing multiple tabs" pref, but that also disables the prompt when you close a window with multiple tabs.

To get the old behavior, you need to set your preferences as follows:

browser.startup.page = 3 ("save my windows and tabs from last time")
browser.tabs.warnOnClose = true (warn when closing more than one tab)
browser.warnOnQuit = false (override warnOnClose when quitting - don't warn)

The third pref is key - it also has no UI.
Beltzner: did you mean WONTFIX? This isn't INVALID.
Its INVALID since its intended behaviour.  But if WONTFIX is going to stick, I'll do that.  Reasoning is in the original bug.
Actually, I never meant to mark this INVALID. And especially since the quit confirmation dialog now contains useless-ui (a "Quit" button that doesn't actually not save and quit) I don't think this is WONTFIX.

Apologies to mconnor, I think I led him astray with the accidental INVALID marking. Reopening.

(Also morphing the summary; I don't think that the restart warning really applies here in the same way, as that warning kind of supersedes the tabs/quit warnings and is meant to remind that session restore isn't 100% dataloss-free.)

> (a "Quit" button that doesn't actually not save and quit)

That'd be bug 385582 of which this bug is a DUPE (or now vice versa).
invalid due to Bug 592822?
Wanted behavior was achieved with Bug 629485
