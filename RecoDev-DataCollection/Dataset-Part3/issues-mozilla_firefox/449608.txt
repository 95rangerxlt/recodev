don't build a few locales working towards 3.0.x still

I've landed mercurial repos for all shipping locales, excluding si and sk, as those still had bigger patches to land.

We should update all-locales to just refer to those repos that actually have content to make things easier.

si and sl ;)

Ouch, I'm not doing that mistake often.

The patch is right, though, it's sl.

I won't be around to actually land this, so checkin-needed.
Landed.
