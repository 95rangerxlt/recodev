Patch V 1

I checked with compiler team for this issue and below is the explanation I
received for the compiler behaviour.

' In the C++ Standard (ISO/IEC 14882), section 14.6.4.2 "Candidate functions"
describes that: for an unqualified function call that depends on a template
parameter, only function declarations with external linkage from the template
definition context should be found. 

 In this scenario the "static" function results in internal linkage and
therefore cannot be found. 

One solution is to make the function non-static by removing "static".

Alternatively we may make the function-call qualified. ' 

The patch submitted has taken alternate approach of making the function-call
qualified.
