chase/granrose can you help on this one?
choffman: Sure thing.

Pawell: Where do you recommend this file go in the mozilla source tree?  Also,
what builds is this file a part of?  We're not certain how/where it's being
packaged right now.
This file is part of firefox browser.xpi (bin/README.txt) package which should
be locale independent. The idea is to move the file from 
/mozilla/browser/app/ into 
/mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/ and every /l10n/browser/locales/@AB-CD@/ 
and then packed it into @AB-CD@.jar (bin\README.txt)

Thus you have to remove corresponding lines form
/mozilla/browser/app/Makefile.in and add them into
/mozilla/browser/locales/Makefile.in  

This is just my idea as a l10n guy, it must be approved/corrected/dumped by
Benjamin.

Related bug 263446
wonder if we could put a copy of the file in mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/ as
step one to allow translation work to get going, and then follow up with mods to
the build and installer packaging systems to start to pick up the file from the
new location... 
This was fixed on the branch -- did it get reviews and approval?
Which character encoding to use for README.txt?
Dean: The fix was discussed and reviewed by bsmedberg last week.  I just got
around to implementing it today.

I meant to post my write-up of the fix sooner.  Here it is:

Moved README.txt from browser/app/ to browser/locales/en-US/.  Updated
browser/app/Makefile.in to remove install of README.txt during libs target. 
Updated browser/locales/Makefile.in to handle installing README.txt for every
locale instance.
