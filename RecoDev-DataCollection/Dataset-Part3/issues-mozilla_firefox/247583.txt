I've tried to build firefox 0.9 as in
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/build.html, but after some minutes, it fails

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the ffox 0.9 source and uncompress
2. Checkout the mozilla/client.mk and mozilla/browser/config files
3. Create a .mozconfig file with just one line: .
$topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig
4. Run "make -f client.mk build"
Actual Results:  
After some minutes, the build stops saying "No rule to build the target 'export'"

Expected Results:  
Finish the build successfully

It happens in debian woody, but I've been told it happened to somebody else

Downloaded again the tarball, and found a problem. In the #firefox channel, I
was told how to patch the bug in the sources: edit the file
view/public/nsIView.h, and modify line 354 to look like this:

virtual nsIWidget* GetWidget() const { return mWindow; }

Then customized the .mozconfig with several changes for gtk
