mozilla-beta 25 still uses an NSPR BETA snapshot.

Wan-Teh, would it be possible for you to release NSPR 4.10.1 within the next few days?

Since Mozilla releases are expected to ship based on released library versions only, this should block FF 25.

(And Aurora 26 will require the same fix.)

NSPR_4_10_1_RTM pushed to mozilla-inbound:

Kai: could you push NSPR_4_10_1_RTM to the repository for Mozilla 25?
I am not familiar with the procedure. Thanks!
