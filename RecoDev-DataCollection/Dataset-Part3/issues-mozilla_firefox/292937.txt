You may have received Mikx's report about the "view image" option allows a
webpage to navigate to chrome page. This also works with the "view background
image" option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable popups for the PoC to work
2. Navigate to http://greyhatsecurity.org/vulntests/background.htm
3. Right click and press "view background image"
Actual Results:  
Popup opens, uses view-source:javascript bug, executes script in context of
all-powerful chrome :)

Expected Results:  
Background image url should be filtered

This is a different report than Mikx's; no dupe! :)

Paul:  Have you been able to reproduce this with Firefox 1.0.4?  I just tried
and although the popup opens, it doesn't look like anything bad is happening.  I
see the following in the JS Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Illegal value"  nsresult: "0x80070057
(NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame ::
http://greyhatsecurity.org/vulntests/runscript.htm :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 8" 
data: no]

And get the following JS error popup:

Permission denied to get property Location.href

Is that the expected behavior?  Or was this fixed between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4?
The testcase makes use of view-source:javascript which was blocked with bug
290982 in ff1.0.4, but there's still a missing security check on view
(background) image.
Fix incorporated into the patch for similar bug 292774, checked in
v.fixed on aviary with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.9)
Gecko/20050706 Firefox/1.0.5 using original testcase.  I get a blank window
after going back, but nothing bad happens.

This testcase relies on view-source:javascript:eval(). The eval() part was only
useful starting in 1.0.3, and the view-source:javascript part was disabled in
1.0.4 by the fix for bug 290982.
