STR:
1. Open https://www.youtube.com and play a video so that the tab sound icon is displayed.
2. Pin the tab
3. Hover the sound visual indicator in both mute and unmute states

ER: The icon shouldn't overlap the tab 

AR: The icon slightly overlaps the tab border: http://i.imgur.com/LzZOMFz.png

Review of attachment 8664849:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This still overlaps the pinned tab border for me. I see a second "hump" at the top of the tab. Shouldn't the margin-start become *more* negative, and the margin-top stay the same or *less* negative? Screenshot, http://screencast.com/t/KCkCDhiif
So after looking at this again, on a pixel level there does not appear to be a second "hump", but cognitively the extra weight of the white background color provides a strong anchor near the icon which gives an illusion of a second hump. I think moving it down one pixel and left one pixel will reduce this illusion.

Maybe margin-top:-8px, margin-inline-start:-15px ?

OK, can you review assuming |margin-top:-8px, margin-inline-start:-15px|?  ;-)
