In Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> General -> Edit Languages we have a XUL
menulist which says.

[ _S_elect a language to add ]

This is the wrong way to do a label for a XUL menulist. The <label
control="menulist-id"/> should be outside of the control. Unfortunately XUL
menulist makes this confusing by offering a label attribute, but that actually
sets which item is initially selected.

Anyway, that accesskey doesn't actually work if you try it. I don't think we
should make it work, mainly because it's not really the right way to label a
menulist, although perhaps I'm not being open minded enough.

Remove accesskey from menu option label

I suppose there's a deeper bug to be fixed here, but we need something simple
at least for branch.

r=mano. If this makes the branch as well, please don't checkin the DTD change.
time is short for beta so if this is gonna make the branch, it needs to land ASAP.
If this isn't landed today, it's not going to make the train.
I checked in the dtd change from this bug on the 1.8 branch since it wasn't checked in originally due to a l10n freeze.
