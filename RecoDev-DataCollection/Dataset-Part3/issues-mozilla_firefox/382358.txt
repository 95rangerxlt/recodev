this might not be checked into M8, depending on whether it ends up as another alpha, or a beta release.
per beltzner: "B1 won't be localized/localizable nor string frozen"

pushing.
moving back into M9, we were planning on shipping any locales that are ready, so this blocks that plan, and we need international testing sooner rather than later...

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
