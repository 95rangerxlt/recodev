In a PDF document (see the URL field), in its page 14, there is a word "Šiauliai" at the top of the left column. However, for some strange reason, letter "Š" in that text is not being shown. By checking with the page inspector, I've figured out that the text block in question has 'serif' font specified, which in my case (and probably by default) means Times New Roman, and this font definitely has the letter in question, so I think it must be a problem with PDF.js or some Windows-specific rendering issue, because the problem does not manifest on Linux.

I can repo in FF19, but looks to be fixed in Aurora.
