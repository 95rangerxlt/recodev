Device discovery currently uses the host name / Android device name as the device name it sends out, which then appears in the runtime list.

If you have multiple devices with the same name, then there's no way to tell them apart at the moment.  Should more info to the name or something to help discriminate.  Or perhaps expose b2g version, etc.?

Unique device discovery names for b2g

Paul, this gives a more unique name on b2g, such as "flame-1234abcd", instead of just "flame".

This would become important anywhere there are many b2g devices on the same local network (like most Mozilla offices I would guess!).

Unique device discovery names for b2g (v2)

To get the settings, use "@mozilla.org/settingsService;1". For example: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/device.js#58

I'll finish the review next week.

As mentioned in previous comment, don't use `window`, but the service.

Try is quite colorful, but looks like all issues were infra problems or known intermittents.
