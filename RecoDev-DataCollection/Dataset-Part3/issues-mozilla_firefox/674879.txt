Patch looks fine, all tests pass locally. Glad to see the Scratchpad tests in their own folder.

How about the scratchpad.dtd/properties files? Do those continue to stay in browser/locales?
I think initially. When we're ready to start hosting our own locale files we should probably create a separate bug to move them all over.
It might be nice to flatten the test directory, I'm not sure there's much use to the second "browser" in browser/devtools/scratchpad/test/browser/ (there are unlikely to be other kinds of tests for scratchpad, and even if there are, they can co-exist in a single directory).
yeah, I considered that. It was problematic to do that for the webconsole, but for scratchpad it might make more sense. I will do so!

Thanks for the review.
