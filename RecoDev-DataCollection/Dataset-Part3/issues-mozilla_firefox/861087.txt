I think the history subview could be done differently.

There should be first three general items :
-Show all history instead of "more" at the bottom.
-Clear recent History... -> bring the clear history dialog or second subview.
-Restore previous session.

If possible "Recently closed" (tabs and windows will be merged) -> this too would need UI (second subview ?).

And then the history last items.

If general commands aren't present it would be a pretty big regression compared to the old menu and these items would be accessible only via the menu bar and shortcuts. 

I know that subview inside a subview looks a bit "Inception-esque" but for certain items it should be at least considered.

We're going to eventually need a way to artificially constrain the maximum height of sub-views, filed bug 861703 for that.

Nit: Mixing self and bind. Since we don't care about removing the event listener, this could potentially be refactored to:

this.subViews.addEventListener("overflow", function() {
  // Resize the subview on the next tick.
  Services.tm.currentThread.dispatch(this._syncContainerWithSubView.bind(this),
    Ci.nsIThread.DISPATCH_NORMAL);
}.bind(this));
