That conflicts with Firebug, which could be a bad idea if we want the two to coexist.
I agree with Simon of course.

Agreed, that's bad and we have a problem with it on Macs anyway that apparently still map F12 to Dashboard.

Shift-F12 if Firebug's installed?
Firebug binds Shift-F12 to "disable". Not sure how many people use it, but at least I do.
Here is how Firebug is using F12:

                       Win+Lin   Mac
Open Firebug Panel 	F12 	F12 	
Close Firebug Panel 	F12 	F12 	
Deactivate Firebug 	Shift + F12 	Shift + F12 	
Open Firebug in window 	Ctrl + F12 	âŒ˜ + F12

Although I haven't played Quake et al in a very long time, my brain is hard-wired  to hit the backtick/tilde key when wanting to open the browser console. I hit F12 reluctantly...

Even as a secondary key binding, it would make a great easter egg!

Can we consider Cmd-Opt-I? I know it's used by the inspector now, but parity with Chrome, no conflict with Firebug (I think).

The bad thing, imho, with Chrome's shortcuts is that none of the three is tool specific. Even Cmd Opt I opens the last opened tool.

If we are planning to let remain the Inspector's, Console's and Debugger's shortcuts as is, then we might not be able to use Cmd Opt I to toggle toolbox.

To me that's good! I need a last-opened-tool shortcut.

Yes, the inspector shortcut would have to change.

Yes we need that. I agree. But lets not change an already popular shortcut's behavior this drastically. Inspector and Console are very widely used, changing their shortcuts might be too much of a surprise for the user.

I don't think it's a drastic change. It'll still open the devtools window, and they could read the new Inspector shortcut on the menu. The tools really aren't that widely used right now, in my perception. ~15,000 inspector opens on Nightly/Aurora in the past week.

We need a shortcut for toggling the tools. It would be ideal to use the same shortcut as another popular set of tools. If F12, some part of the 3 million Firebug users would be very annoyed. I think that leaves  Cmd+Opt+I .

It would be awesome to have a similar number for Firebug and then we can compare to form a decision. [i.e The number of times Firebug got open using F12 in last week]
Nick mentioned that we could use F12 (in addition to Cmd-Opt-I), but make sure Firebug overrides it.
Bug for Ctrl+Shift+I/Cmd+Opt+I: bug 892168
dibs!
For the first pass of this, I'm going to add the F12 shortcut if Firebug is not present.
I want F12 to work more than anything else in the entire world.

landed in fx-team : https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/fa4afb7214ae

But .. no tests ?
Backed out for talos xperf regressions.

for reference, the xperf regression was that we were accessing new files at startup (a perf regression) due to the addon manager being instantiated.
