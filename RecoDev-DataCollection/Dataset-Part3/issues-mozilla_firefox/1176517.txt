Latest Nightly, French

See attached screenshot, newtab-customize-panel-anchor is hidding "collecte" in newtab.intro.paragraph2 in French.

Tested on Dev edition, can't find newtab-customize-panel-anchor. So, only Nightly is affected so far.

You can't see it in English, because the text goes to a new line before reaching the white square.

I believe the anchor got added by bug 1168589 when the arrow panel was converted to a div.
Simple fix is probably to hide the anchor for the intro.
