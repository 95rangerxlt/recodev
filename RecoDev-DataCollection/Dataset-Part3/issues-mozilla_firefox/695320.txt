This was brought up by the browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js test once I attempted to land bug 692130 - the move to components meant the tabview tests now ran after the private browsing tests. That popupmode tests switching a window from being a popup to not being a popup and back, using ss.setWindowState().

Thanks to http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ed6776b1ac0d , setWindowState ends up calling TabView::init again to have the keyboard shortcut disabled correctly. Unfortunately, this only works for the transition from not-popup->popup, and not vice-versa. That results in the shortcut being broken in that window after the browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode test, which causes browser_tabview_bug595518.js to fail.

I propose we fix the code, since while browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode is doing something quite unusual, it's not easy to fix (using another window is complicated because of PB mode) and not something entirely unreasonable to expect to work (given behavior of setWindowState and its attempt to half-support that).
