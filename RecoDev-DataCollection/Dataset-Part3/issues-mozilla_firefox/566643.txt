i have a group that's stacked (let me know if my terminology is incorrect here!).

i keep clicking on the area inside the container but just missing the stack itself, and nothing happens. in the stack scenario, the whole container should be clickable, causing the stack to pop out and open.

(i do not think this is true for groups that are not stacks)

Aza, do you agree? Makes sense to me. Of course you would still be able to drag. 

I suppose one tricky area would be clicking to edit the title; if you miss the title, the stack will expand... not a very nice failure mode.
This has been implemented, but still lacks a good form of indication.
