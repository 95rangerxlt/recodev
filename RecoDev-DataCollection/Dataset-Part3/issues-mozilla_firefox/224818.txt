update CFBundleGetInfoString and CFBundleShortVersionString in Info.plist to reflect current version number
isn't this supoosed to be auto updated?
a previous incarnation of this bug (bug 206187) was marked duplicate of bug
180759.  i think they do intend to fix this in the build process so that it
happens automatically.  feel free to mark as dupe if you think appropriate.

centralize firebird version

So, this is one thing we could do to keep everything in sync in the future.  It
adds a browser/configure script which substitutes the version number into the
appropriate files.
Sweet! Let's get this in. 

Leaf, can you use this or something like it for SeaMonkey?

alternate patch

I'm going to do this instead, to avoid the problem in the previous patch where
the .dtd is not regenerated when the .dtd.in changes.
checked in.
In the latest trunk build, Info.plist is not build properly.

In mozilla/app/macbuild/Contents/Info.plist.in, @BORWSER_VERSION@ seems to be
set but not replaced.
I still seeing the problem in the 0.8 BRANCH build (pulled from CVS 2004-01-22
~10:00 UTC)
Version and short Version show 1.4a (should be 1.6) and BundleString shows 0.6.1
(should be 0.7+)
I hope it gets fixed for 0.8 final, it is very irritation to see a nearly-0.8
Firebird identified as "1.4a".
cc'ing myself. I just checked in a similar system for thunderbird. I want to
track this bug in case there are any problems with the patch.

@APP_VERSION@ should be changed to APP_VERSION.
Hi Brian.

Your patch in mozilla/browser/app/macbuild/Contents/Info.plist.in is not good.

You set two "<string>@APP_VERSION@</string>" 
at the line 85 and 136 in mozilla/browser/app/macbuild/Contents/Info.plist.
These should be set to "<string>APP_VERSION</string>".

Please check and fix as attachment 139981.

Looks good, and you actually missed a few other places.  I checked in the fix.
