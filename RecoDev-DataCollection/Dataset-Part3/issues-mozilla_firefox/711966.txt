The accelerator key for the 3D menu button in the Page Inspector is 'M'. We should change this to the number '3' key for Windows and Linux to match the string.

Also changed access key to D on mac.
There should be at least a localization note in the DTD file telling localizers that accesskey2 is for Mac...

Alt+3 selects the third tab on Linux.
Any reason against using D across platforms?

Alt+D focuses the awesomebar on Windows.

Maybe we can use 3 on Windows, D on Mac OS X and Linux? I just tested in Windows, Alt+3 doesn't apparently do anything.
that could work but it sure is a lot of keys for one button. :)

- use #ifdef XP_WIN
- set inspect3DButton.accesskey to D
- add inspect3DButton.windowsAccesskey with 3

Err, doesn't Alt+D focus the location bar on Linux as well?

Just saw it. Hmm, yes, it does.
3 on Windows and Linux, D on Mac?

Wait, no, comment 4 :(
Any other suggestions?
Label the button "3D View" and use V?
(In reply to Dão Gottwald [:dao] from comment #16)
> Label the button "3D View" and use V?

Or "3D DOM" and continue using M. Which one sounds better?
3D DOM doesn't seem to make sense to me...

Alt+V opens the View menu on Linux (probably Windows too).
I think we should WONTFIX this one.

We need to change the entity name here... Localizers have already picked up 3D on aurora, together with random bogus access keys.

Alt+W?

Is inspect3DButton.accesskey3d a good entity name?
No, accesskey3d doesn't make sense... You could just call it inspect3DViewButton.accesskey.

Found a better solution.

update the entity reference in the localization note
What can we do to prevent locales from picking access keys that conflict with the menu bar?

For Tilt specifically, we could add a test to check if using the access key indeed opens the visualization.

Well, we'd to run that test on localized builds... The concern also isn't limited to this single button.

W, eh? Why not!
So can we land this? :)
yes. please put [land-in-fx-team] in the status whiteboard when ready to ship.

Landed:

Quick note: accesskeys are case sensitive. You have "3D View" with "W" which should have been lowercase. (unfortunately, I just noticed after landing)

For future reference, please check: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL_Accesskey_FAQ_and_Policies
Will this make the button text be "3D View (W)"? We can do a quick follow-up.
