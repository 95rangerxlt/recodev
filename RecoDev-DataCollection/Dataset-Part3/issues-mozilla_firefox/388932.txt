I believe there were also a couple references to talkback in the shared toolkit/mozapps/installer files.
Checked in to trunk

Checking in mozilla/browser/installer/windows/nsis/shared.nsh;
/cvsroot/mozilla/browser/installer/windows/nsis/shared.nsh,v  <--  shared.nsh
new revision: 1.13; previous revision: 1.12
done
Checking in mozilla/browser/installer/windows/nsis/installer.nsi;
/cvsroot/mozilla/browser/installer/windows/nsis/installer.nsi,v  <--  installer.nsi
new revision: 1.30; previous revision: 1.29
done

When talkback isn't included in the build we exclude it during runtime.
