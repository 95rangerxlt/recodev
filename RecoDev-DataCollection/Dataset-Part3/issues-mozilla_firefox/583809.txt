This bug has two ways to find it:

Method 1:

1. Be asked to do a review a bug on the Web Console
2. While looking at the code, come across some existing code in a function called 'setFilterTextBoxEvents' which makes a button respond to the 'click' event rather than correctly using the 'command' event.
3. Slap the original developer.

Method 2:

1. Open Tools -> Web Console
2. Enter some filter text
3. Tab to the Clear Filter button
4. Press Space

Expected:
 The filter text to be cleared

Actual:
  Nothing happens

The workaround is to just focus the filter text field and press delete, which makes one wonder why the clear filter button is there in the first place.

The original developer who was trained in the proper setting of xul events?

good luck finding him. 

In the meantime, maybe you can use this bug to actually help train the original developer? kthxbye

The training is simple. One just needs to replace 'click' with 'command'. The training is complete.

Anyway, all kidding aside, here is a patch.

Cool, thanks. If you can r+ this patch, i think it could then be checked in. Cheers!
Er, I wrote the patch, so I shouldn't review it.
OK, so this was actually handled by bug 582121, so this is not needed anymore.
