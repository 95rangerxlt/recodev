In the Find toolbar, you can use Tab to move between the Find  entry and the Match Case checkbox.  Next, Previous, and Highlight All are not in the Tab order., however.

While these buttons are accessible via keyboard shortcut (Alt P, Alt N, and Alt A respectively), it requires that the user have vision to identify what the underlined letters are. :-)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Control F to move focus to the entry on the Find toolbar
2. Press Tab/Shift Tab to move among the controls
Actual Results:  
You cannot move focus to the Next, Previous, and Highlight All buttons.

Expected Results:  
You could move focus to the Next, Previous, and Highlight All buttons.

I'm pretty sure the reason the buttons aren't focusable is because you can use keyboard shortcuts for them: (Shift+)F3 for Find Previous/Next and Alt+A to Highlight All.
You can also check the Match Case checkbox with Alt+C, but it is still focusable. And please don't take my snarky comment as an RFE to remove its focusability. :-) :-) :-)

If you are blind and your screen reader announces that you are on a toolbar, and you've never been on that toolbar before, the logical thing to do is use Tab/Shift+Tab (or the Arrow keys) to explore what's there.  When toolbar items are not focusable, these buttons can go undetected.

If it wouldn't be too much trouble to add these buttons into the Tab order, I think it would be helpful for quite a few users.

Thanks!!!
I agree with this. Match case is already in the tab order, and the others should be as well. It's important for screen reader users.
then how about other toolbarbuttons? none of them is in tab order
It looks Arrow makes more sense than Tab here.
Once focus was put in toolbar, pressing arrow key to move focus among toolbar buttons is popular that pressing tab key.
This isn't really a typical toolbar, which is below the menubar and has parallel items in the menubar.

Please put them in the tab order. If they are toolbarbutton the add class="tabbable".

Sometimes these things are tabbable when there is no alternative. Look at print preview.
