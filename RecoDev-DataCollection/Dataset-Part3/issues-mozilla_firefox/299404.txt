It should be possible to "make -C browser/installer" to prepare a dmg for
distribution.  This isn't working for Firefox/DeerPark debug builds, because
when configured for debug, the packager expects the application to be built as
dist/$(APP_NAME)Debug.app.  The build machinery in browser doesn't special-case
debug builds, so you wind up with dist/DeerPark.app instead.

Thunderbird and Seamonkey both contain the logic necessary to append Debug, and
so should Firefox.

It's not likely that debug builds will need to be packaged often, but there is a
need for it right now.  The packaged-up builds are stripped of debugging
symbols, resulting in a 12MB dmg in the case of Firefox.
