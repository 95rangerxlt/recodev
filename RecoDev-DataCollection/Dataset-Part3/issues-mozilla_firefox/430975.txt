In bug 368091, I seem to have accidentally landed app-license.html without a closing </p> tag :(  As long as license.html remains html, this just breaks validation, but it's wrong nonetheless :(

Gavin, you're the reviewer of record on the browser bits; can you r this goof-fix?

Requesting approval to land this typo-fix.  There's no risk, and it makes the Firefox copy of about:license valid HTML again (and will be needed if bug 423104 makes about:license xhtml).
