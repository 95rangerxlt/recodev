The Firefox button has a difference from native Win7 caption buttons, if I click on the top right of a maximized window, the close btton is pressed, even if it's not under my mouse, the clickable area extends to the right till the screen side.

The same should be for the Firefox menu button, so that I don't have to aim at it, but I can just quickly move to the top-left of the screen and click.

One possible way of fixing this is to remove the left margin of the Firefox button when the window is maximized.

Where are we putting Firefox button bugs? Toolbar or Menus?
This was actually changed to the current behavior in bug 575243 because we wanted to be able to resize the window instead of using fitts law or too big of hitzone, but maybe the hitzone is too big?
by the way: try a clean new profile and you'll see that until you maximize the window or restart Firefox - the very first run on a new profile draws firefox button 1px to left and 1px higher than the whole window, e.g. the button is partially outside the window.
Don't want to file a new bug for that, since there are a lot of such micro bugs.

There is a bug for that somewhere probably, if not file another bug.

Actually I think that only applied to the normal state.  Maximized state should be fitts law here, just like the close button.

Effectively nudges the Firefox Button left 1 pixel.

The border of the firefox button does not touch the edge to match the visual style of other UI elements on Windows, like the close button and the start menu button.

I'm not sure I'm seeing the effect I'm supposed to see.
Did you test this with Aero Glass / Basic, Classic?

Desired effects:
(1) The left border of the Firefox button is the same distance from the left side of the screen as the right border of the window close button is from the right side of the screen.
(2) If you move the cursor to the top left corner of the screen and click, the Firefox menu appears.
(3) If you move the cursor to the top right corner of the screen and click, the window is closed.

Aero and Basic:
(1) adding patch gets it almost right
(2) adding patch makes it work
(3) already works without patch

Classic:
(1) firefox menu button is already too far to the left without the patch
(2) already works without patch
(3) doesn't work; patch doesn't help yet

If you have ideas that could fix this cleanly, feel free to post a patch and take the bug.
Meanwhile, I'll keep tinkering with it.

This is bug 606160.

patch v2

This still moves the firefox button 1 pixel closer to the edge than the window close button. The only ways I can think of to expand the clickable area without affecting the border are:
1. Wrap the app menu button in yet another container.
2. Set an event listener on its container. (Hack!)

Is it worth to go about the first one for pixel perfection?
We need to add padding to the titlebar buttons anyway (see bug 606160) so I would vote for the pixel perfect solution.

I think bug 606160 will fix this.

It did.
