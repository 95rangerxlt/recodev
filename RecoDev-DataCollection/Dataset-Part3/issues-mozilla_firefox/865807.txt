Steps to reproduce:

open a link for a pdf
internal pdf viewer is activated and shows the document


Actual results:

there were parts in the doc with transparency. This was completely ignored and rendering shows object with transparency = 0.


Expected results:

Transparency should be rendered also

I will try to create a reduced file and add it as attachment

Created attachment 742001
partial transparency of white waves is not respected
Created attachment 742037
screenshot of rendering error
Hint: Standalone PDF viewers like okular render correctly
The transparency is already fixed on trunk but confirming because we still display a compatibility warning
Warning will be going away soon too.
