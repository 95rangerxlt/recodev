This looks like a regression from bug 900865.
How so? Does the global-sharing for content scripts work differently in e10s builds?

I'm not sure why the access is considered an error. That might be worth investigating, since we use Services elsewhere in that file.

The problem I was worried about is that Services.search.defaultEngine will (I assume) only be correct in the parent process, so we should be sending its value in a message from the parent.

I'll try to look at this more closely next week.
Oh, I see - the search service initialization in the child must be failing for some reason.

I just passed the search engine name down from the parent.

LGTM, thanks for working on this!
I filed bug 930456 to cover the general problem of the search service not working in child processes.
