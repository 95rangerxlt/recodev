MozReview Request: Bug 1221500 - use a notification to warn people that panorama is going away, r?ttaubert, a?sylvestre

Hi Sylvestre! A little hiccup from mozreview there, but, this is a string patch that I would like to land on aurora.

Rationale:

We are going to remove tab groups / panorama.

We would like to warn users about this well in advance.

I would like to do the removal in 45. 45 is an ESR release and delaying one more release will mean any backports to 45 will be frustrated by the tab groups tests and feature being present. It's a relatively big feature to remove that has its tentacles everywhere in frontend code, and a few places besides that.

Philipp argued in bug 1221050 that we should warn people that this is coming the release before. That means doing something in 44 to warn users. The proposed way to do this would be to show a desktop notification. Which needs strings.

The one other option we have is to not show a desktop notification but to always just open a new tab with the relevant SUMO page. The downside of this is that tab groups users are more likely than ordinary users to have multiple windows, which creates the risk that such an extra tab would be missed. This would, however, avoid the extra strings going into aurora.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: tab groups removal
[User impact if declined]: we'd have to use a suboptimal method of letting people know the feature is going away
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: no
[Risks and why]: pretty low, aurora is only just cut, we can tweak the detection of tab groups usage if necessary (without further l10n impact)
[String/UUID change made/needed]: yes, 2 strings added

Do we really have to add even more strings to 44? We're already breaking the rules here.

I've added this, using the same strings, and using a button rather than a link, and with the same styling as the existing banner there (that tells you we've enabled session restore for you if you start using tab groups). I don't think it's worth making that banner look pretty, though if you feel very strongly the current styling is horrible then we can deal with that in a followup.

I think this looks OK, though it should probably be "Tab Groups" with a capital G.

P.S. It makes me very sad to work on this string. I use Tab Groups all the time!
This will need to go in to the 38.x (38.6.0?) ESR release as well, won't it?

We can't add new strings on ESR release, so it's a no on my side of things.

As gBrowser.hideTab() is probably used by other add-ons as well, maybe check TabView.firstUseExperienced too? These two conditions do not reliably tell whether the user just peeked once and then never used it again, or stopped using it, or still uses it, but I think that's the best we can do.

This seems unused?

Nit: We don't call it Panorama anywhere in here, iirc. Why not just notifyDeprecation() or notifyAboutDeprecation()? Not that it matters a lot anymore...
Sylvestre, can I get approval to preland the strings from this patch on aurora? I don't really want to show the notification until we have a decent SUMO page, and from bug 1221497 it seems that for that it'd be useful to know which add-ons work, for which more work needs to be done, which is going to take time. The issue here is the l10n thing which really needs to go in ASAP if it is going to get there at all, so please can you review that for approval so as to take some of the time pressure off? :-)
Why are we not just landing this on central and the feature removal in six weeks? As much as I support that this is finally happening, do we gain anything by taking a six weeks shortcut?

45 is esr, and backporting pretty much anything after that is going to be hell.
You mean conflicts in code outside of browser/components/tabview/ using the TabView API? I think those should be in the same ballpark as with other random code changes happening in any given six week cycle. "Hell" sounds a bit exaggerated.

That's the smaller part of the problem. My reason for saying hell is the following: if I write a patch for Firefox 46, and then uplift to 45 ESR, and touch anything related to tabs, docshell loading behaviour / beforeunload, or tabmodal dialogs, or stuff like that, I'm liable to break some of the tabview tests because they touch "interesting" parts of how we deal with tabs and tabmodal dialogs. The tests wouldn't be there for 46, but would be for 45, and so patches would bounce off ESR (and if we ignore the tests, they would actually break something that we would then still be shipping).

Bug 967873, for instance, has already had to jump through hoops because of tabview. It's too late for that bug now, but considering the focus on e10s and its performance, and some of the issues we've had with tabmodal onbeforeunload, I'm sure that there will be other cases once tabview is actually gone.

Really, all I'm asking for is to uplift 3 strings in the first week of aurora. Doesn't seem like the end of the world to me, considering the trade-offs.
Redirecting to Ritu as she owns 44.

Pike, heads up this patch here has some string changes that need to be included in Aurora44. I am leaning towards taking it. I know it is not ideal that this came after the merge but it seems like a good idea to include in Aurora44. Please let me know if you have any concerns.

This has been in Nightly for a few days and it seems like a good idea despite the string changes to warn our users of upcoming changes. This kind of stuff helps our end-users be more aware of changes that might be coming along the way. Let's uplift to Aurora44.
