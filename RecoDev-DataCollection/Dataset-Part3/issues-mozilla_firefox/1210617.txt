Using FF 44.0a1 x64.

STR: (in a clean profile)
- launch Firefox: it will open a Normal window
- open a Private window and open any PDF file, eg http://www.cbu.edu.zm/downloads/pdf-sample.pdf
Now, as it's displayed in the build-in PDF viewer (and it's completely loaded), 
click the 'down arrow' button in the build-in viewer in order to download it . 
Observe that:
1. the 'down arrow' button remains pressed
2. the animation in the Downloads button doesn't appear: if you clicki the button, you see that there's no entry for that file in the panel.
- Now, switch to the Normal window and click on the Downloads button:
you'll see that the entry for the PDF file was added there, instead.


Pn the other hand, if you download the PDF file 
via rightclicking on the document in the build-in PDF viewer and pressing 'Save Page as' instead, 
then the issue doesn't occur.

This issue only occurs with e10s enabled, i.e. in e10s windows.
This sounds very similar to bug 1199841.
Kostas: you filed this bug just a few days ago. Did you notice whether this is a recent regression, or you can't tell for sure? (i.e., you used to do this often in the past and it worked fine, even with e10s on)
No, unfortunately I can't tell for sure.
felipe, were you going to pick this up?
Yeah, and i'm hoping it's a dupe of bug 1199841, but we will see

The problem is that ExternalHelperAppParent implements nsIChannel but not PrivateBrowsingChannel, which makes nsExternalAppHandler::RetargetLoadNotifications miss the pb status when calling NS_UsePrivateBrowsing.

I think this should work.  I assume you've tested the patch manually?
Yep I did, it works.  I'm assuming that there's nothing that needs to be changed here given the new patch in bug 8690005?

(Not sure how I came up with that number, but) I meant bug 1199841
