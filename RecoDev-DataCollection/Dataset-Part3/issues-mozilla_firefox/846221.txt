Steps to reproduce:
 1) Open preferences.
 2) Go to the "Content" pane.
 3) In the Fonts & Colors section, click the button labeled "Advanced…"
 4) Look at the section labeled "Character Encoding"

Actual results:
The labeling of the section and the pop-up menu doesn't communicate the purpose of the setting. "Default" for what?

Expected results:
The labeling of the pop-up menu should communicate that the setting is the fallback character encoding for unlabeled legacy content. ("Fallback", "unlabeled" and "legacy" being keywords that should be present.)

Additional info:
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Localizations_and_character_encodings for additional info.

Label the pref more understandably
(Yes, I realize I didn't actually use the word "unlabeled" after all.)
Thanks.
