Seen while looking at crash stats. https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/list?signature=browsemngr.dll@0x11a7e3. Affects beta but there are crashes in 14.0.1 as well.

All the comments seem to be in Japanese. Will hunt down the version in the correlation reports- so far 2.2.565.25 looks suspect, 
http://www.performersoft.com/software.php seems to be the company that makes the software.

I tried contacting them through their site. I'll report back if I hear back from them.
This shows up on the explosive report today for 15, but is on other branches as well: https://crash-analysis.mozilla.com/rkaiser/2012-08-15/2012-08-15.firefox.15.explosiveness.html
It's #45 top browser crasher in 14.0.1, #129 in 15.0b5, #45 in 16.0a2.

It's software bundled with Babylon that makes those applications hard to uninstall except in Windows Safe Mode with anti-malware software.

Here are some comments, sometimes translated in English by Google Translate:
"The homepage has become absolutely babylon search."
"Search babylon screen would be displayed on the start page."
"Firefox does not boot at all after you install the babylon."
"Adon babylon made the serious problem. We need you to cope with such a crash like this."
"Can no longer start. This could be caused by babylon."
"Babylon is installed automatically when you install software, Firefox does not boot after uninstall perhaps. I can not even boot in safe mode. We can not be started in Safe Mode → babylon re-install I have installed the latest version of the Firefox uninstall → start Firefox the babylon. Be due to add-ons. Naa trouble."
"We will not start again to uninstall babylontoolbar, reset the default from babylon to the home page of the browser, and then restart."
"Firefox will not start up was to uninstall babylon toolbar"
"Firefox was not able to start babylon is installed when you install the mouse gesture of Chrome."

We should check after the merge is bug 721264 helps reduce the incidence of this crash on Firefox 16. It's a different DLL, but maybe the block will eliminate the problem.
Hi, All. Many thanks for report. Can you assign bug to me? We will investigate and fix it asap.
Here are recent correlations:
  browsemngr.dll@0x11bc23|Unhandled C++ Exception (98 crashes)
    100% (98/98) vs.   1% (1138/85590) browsemngr.dll
        100% (98/98) vs.   1% (483/85590) 2.2.630.40
A Babylon update was recently released that should fix this problem. There should be noticeable decline in these crashes now or soon.

I don't think so because the latest version is affected:
  browsemngr.dll@0x121a03|Unhandled C++ Exception (29 crashes)
    100% (29/29) vs.   2% (3207/147487) browsemngr.dll

The volume has dropped significantly though (now at #132 and #137).
Because of a new version of the DLL, or other reasons?
It seems like this was fixed with the last Babylon release. Please reopen if the crash rate increases again.
It's #87 top browser crasher in 15.0.1 and #60 in 16.0b5.
The latest Babylon version doesn't fix it:
  browsemngr.dll@0x121a03|Unhandled C++ Exception (117 crashes)
    100% (117/117) vs.   3% (5946/172838) browsemngr.dll

        100% (117/117) vs.   3% (4986/172838) 2.2.643.41

Startup crashes caused by third-party software fluctuate depending on the tap flow and the evacuation hole size of the bathtub.
Can we get an update on crash stats? The Babylon people are saying that they should have dropped by now.

I don't see crashes in version 2.3.787.43 and above of browsemngr.dll.
Calling this fixed per comment #14.
