STR:

1. Install Talkilla & Log in
2. Open the conversation window with someone
3. Start a call with that person
4. As the call starts, click to another application - before the permissions dialog is presented.

Actual Results

No popup appears, no camera icon in the toolbar of the conversation window

Expected Results

Grey camera icon is shown in the toolbar

Additional comment: when I click the area where the icon should be, the icon appears and the popup is displayed.
Looks like an edge case of bug 809085.

Patch v1

This patch fixes the bug reported by Mark for the SocialAPI chat windows. I'm not sure if this bug applies to the social sidebars too (how are we displaying permission icons for the sidebar? Is it in the toolbar button that we are in the process of removing?), nor of how notification icons are displayed for social status panels.
Only the chat window case seems to matter for Talkilla, but when looking at the patch, you may want to check that it doesn't break anything for other cases; if they worked now.

Requesting feedback from Shane who wrote in bug 809085 the code I'm modifying. Will request review from Felipe later if Shane says the patch looks reasonable.
The patch was a bit old, so I pushed it to try to be sure it didn't get broken: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=84bf8628d59f

The results were green enough, so:
