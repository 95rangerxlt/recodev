Build ID: 20150918100310

Steps to reproduce:

Launch Firefox.
Open a Web page that contains an element with a specific width and an automatic length of at least 700 pixels (sample file attached).
Open the developer tools (right-click > Inspect Element (Q)).
Right-click the <body> element > Screenshot Node.
Save file locally.


Actual results:

Instead of the specified width (in the sample, 1000 pixels), the image has a width 13 pixels smaller (987 with the sample). No matter what width is used, the resulting screenshot's width is 13 pixels smaller (resulting in broken images if the specified width is under 14 pixels). However, if the element's height goes under approximately 700 pixels (by removing some of the text), the screenshot has correct dimensions.


Expected results:

The entire element should be captured regardless of its size.

I can confirm this behavior on my system.

I also noticed it with nodes of lower heights like the performance comparison table on http://julialang.org/ (see attached screenshots).

FWIW, for me at OS-level zoom of 200% (Windows 7 HP), clipped area is approx 35px wide.
â€¦and approx 14px wide with the reporter's attachment 8667974.
In further testing, I think I've gotten to the core of the issue.

The 700px size in comment 0 is not really critical.  What is important is that the window is short enough vertically that a vertical scrollbar appears in the window.  The width that is cut off is roughly the width of the vertical scrollbar.

Mac uses floating scrollbars by default, but you can also trigger it there by setting Show scroll bars -> Always.

Looks good to me. Should we add some tests about this? To ensure that the image's size are correct both for element and window screenshot?

Well, reading from the clipboard was quite an uphill battle... but anyway, I've added some tests!
