As per subject, but add to that I do not get the message asking me whether I would like to save my current tabs. When click to close, Firefox closes without prompting me that I am closing multiple tabs. 

Installation on this and my work machine is similar. I don't have this problem with the work machine though. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox with Multiple tabs
2. Close Firefox, it closes straight away. 
3. Report to Bugzilla
Actual Results:  
Firefox closed suddenly instead of asking me whether I want to close as I have multiple tab. 

Expected Results:  
Firefox should prompt me to close.

The warning when I'm closing multiple tabs appear when the download window is open, but not when there are no other windows. 
I noticed this today too, running 3.0 Beta 1.
Tools > Options > Main > Startup: "When Firefox Starts" : "Show my windows and tabs from last time" <-- If this is enabled, Firefox will not prompt anymore when closing more than one tab. 

Marking this as resolved. Thanks to the people in the forum for spotting this. 
I am using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9b2) Gecko/2007121120 Firefox/3.0b2.

The behavior in FF3.0b2 seem to be different when you have the 'Clear Browsing History' enabled in 'Tools->Options->Privacy->Private Data->Settings'.

Even though you have the 'Tools->Options->Main->Startup' 'When Firefox Starts : Show my windows and tabs from last time' option selected, Firefox does not open the tabs and windows from last time (with clear private data enabled for browsing history).

Not quite sure if this is the expected behavior or if this is a bug.

Ideally i would've preferred to have the windows and tabs I had open last time (when closing firefox) re-opened when firefox restarts according to the Main->Startup option (even though I have set to clear browsing history). If I don't want to firerox to re-open windows and tabs from last time, I could always close all tabs and windows before closing firefox.

Lack of a warning when closing multiple tabs as long as the 'Startup' option is set to open tabs and windows from last time is fine, as long as it 'WILL' open them even with the 'clear browsing history' enabled.

As it is implemented currently, I wouldn't be able to achieve the behavior explained above (with the clear browsing history enabled). Fyi.. firefox 2.0.xx was able to achieve this behavior, with these settings.
After automatic update to 6.0.1 the issue has re-appeared.
