This is no more needed, now that bug 500081 is properly fixed.

This bug practically ends up in removing all the sections marked
#ifdef XP_UNIX
#ifndef XP_MACOSX
from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/places/content/browserPlacesViews.js and check the tests (there may be one to fix/remove)
