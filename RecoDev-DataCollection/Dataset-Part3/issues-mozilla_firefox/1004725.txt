Requests:
1. Remove 1.2 builds.  1.2 will never ship to consumers.  Carriers have opted to go right to 1.3 and newer.  The only was a user could have this is either from a geeksphone image, or from checking out the 1.2 branch of gaia and flashing that.  Therefor we should remove all traces of 1.2.

2. Remove 1.5 builds.  1.5 was renamed to 2.0, so scrap 1.5 builds.

3. Add 2.0 builds from here [1].

This part seems overly aggressive to me.  They work just fine.  Some people do have a Geeksphone image, or may have built that Gaia branch themselves.  1.2 simulators are not built automatically, so there is no ongoing cost.

Mozilla released a 1.2 version of the OS, so we have a simulator for it.

Down the road, if there ends up being some kind of burden to support this version for some reason (currently there does not seem to be, as best I can tell), then that's additional information that may lead to a different decision.

What would be the point to keep a 1.2 version? Any use?
Just for the sake of simplicity, if we can get rid of one simulator, that's better.
I'm not saying we should do it, but is possible to uninstall the simulator 1.2 from the user's machine?

There definitely are people who have 1.2 on their devices through some means, likely upgrading manually or downloading from Geeksphone, where it is easy to get any major version.  Such people are more likely to be developers if they have gone to this trouble.  It makes sense to me to want a simulator that matches the OS version on your phone, so we should offer it for them.

It's also good to have each major milestone for historical comparison:  If you're a developer wanting to know when a certain API or feature first appeared and the docs don't tell you, fire up some simulators to figure it out.

As an aside, I'll note that we currently appear to have nightly builds of Firefox on our FTP going back 10 years...

I don't see a reason to remove something here based solely on lack of uptake by carriers.  That's not something we have much control over.  We released a major version of Firefox OS, and here is it's simulator.  Why is that wrong?

I really hope it is not possible. :( We should not have the power to remove something the user actively chose to install.
Didn't ZTE also publish an update to 1.2 for the Open?
:past: I don't think so.

There is an official update to 1.2 from ZTE as described on hacks.m.o[1], but I do not believe it was published as a OTA update for all users.

[1]: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/01/upgrading-your-zte-open-to-firefox-1-1-or-1-2-fastboot-enabled/
This is what we will do:
- hide 1.2 from the list
- rename 1.5 to 2.0
- add a link to archives: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/ where we can find 1.2

Assigning Alex.

As I'm a poor html writer and web design, this addition can most likely be css/markup-tweaked to be nicer...

Let's try to keep it simple:
just add:
>       <li><a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/fxos-simulator/">archives</a></li>

below the buttons (in the same <ul>), remove the margin to .button, and add:

>       ul > li > a {
>        margin: 20px;
>      }

I don't think we should have a link to the night yet.

Done.
