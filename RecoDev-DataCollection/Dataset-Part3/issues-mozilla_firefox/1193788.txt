Steps to reproduce:

The performanceUI.exportButton in performance.dtd seems to be unused. See search below.

Instead, the label for the button is pulled from performance.properties:

Here's a patch that removes what I believe is cruft from performance.dtd.

Is it likely that there are other unused variables in performance.dtd which have been superseded by variables in performance.properties? If so, I could go through and find the other ones as part of this issue.

Thanks Lin! Yeah, we just moved over/combined the timeline and profiler localization strings, so I'm sure there's a few vestigial localizations in these files..

Thanks again!

This patch:
- Removes performanceUI.newtab.tooltiptext and performanceUI.exportButton
- Corrects comments for performanceUI.options.filter.tooltiptext and performanceUI.options.gear.tooltiptext so they use the correct identifier
- Moves toolbar.*.tooltips so that each is below the corresponding toolbar label
