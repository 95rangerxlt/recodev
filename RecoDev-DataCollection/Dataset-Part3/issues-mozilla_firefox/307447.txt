This has been there for months.  It also exists in the JavaScript Console.  I
fixed it in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301039 but Ben G.
reverted it back by removing that specific fix.  I have no clue as to why he did
that.  No real explanation was given.

In the default WinXP theme I see only a one pixel white line. Maybe meant as
(reflecting) light?

not going to block on this though I'm sure we'd consider a fully reviewed fix if
it's low risk.
The following changes to toolbar.css will fix this issue once and for all!

-  border-top: 2px solid;
-  -moz-border-top-colors: ThreeDShadow ThreeDHighlight;
 }
 
 /* ::::: toolbar & menubar ::::: */
 
 toolbar {
   min-width: 1px;
   min-height: 19px;
   border-top: 1px solid ThreeDHighlight;
   border-bottom: 1px solid ThreeDShadow;
 }
 
 toolbar[type="menubar"], menubar {
   min-width: 1px;
   border-bottom: 1px solid ThreeDShadow;
-  border-top: 0px !important;
+}
+
+toolbox > toolbar:first-child, toolbox > menubar:first-child {
+  border-top: 2px solid;
+  -moz-border-top-colors: ThreeDShadow ThreeDHighlight;
 }

don't assume the first toolbar is always a menubar
Checked this in on the 1.8 branch. Is this relevant to the trunk? It doesn't apply there.

I believe this issue does exist on the trunk as well.  I'm not sure if this patch will apply on the trunk though.

It won't. That's what I said in comment 7.
This isn't relevant on the trunk. Should you get the same issue there, please file a regression against bug 313388 (Windows Classic only).
