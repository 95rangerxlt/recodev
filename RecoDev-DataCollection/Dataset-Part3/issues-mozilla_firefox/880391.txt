UX reported that sometimes the menu panel seems slow or janky when it is first opened.

Blake, you're currently investigating the customization transition smoothness...if you have time, can you investigate this one too?

I think we can chalk this up to sync reflows caused by the mutation observers when the panel is being first populated.
Hopefully fixed by bug 880701, though there might be other performance improvements we can make on the panel later on.
