I am using a windows 32 bit UX 24.0a1 (2013-06-06) build on Windows 7 64-bit, with the latest patch before build being 788d4dc9aaca.
The context menu works, but for some buttons it consistently closes the panel on right click. The buttons affected are Preferences, Add-ons and Private Browsing. I haven't tested all available buttons thought.

All buttons that haven't toolbar's icons seem affected.
