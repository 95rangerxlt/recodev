Steps to reproduce:

We push out our own updates of Thunderbird by setting app.update.url.override to our own url. This has worked fine up to version 10.0.7esr. Now when a user tries to update to 10.0.8esr, no update is found even though we have made 10.0.8esr available for the users.


Actual results:

In the error log, the following is shown:
Error: Expected certificate attribute 'issuerName' value incorrect, expected: 'OU=Equifax Secure Certificate Authority,O=Equifax,C=US', got: '<our certificate provider>'.
Source File: resource://gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm
Line: 103
Error: Expected certificate attribute 'commonName' value incorrect, expected: 'aus3.mozilla.org', got: '<our certificate name>'.
Source File: resource://gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm
Line: 103
Error: Certificate checks failed. See previous errors for details.
Source File: resource://gre/modules/CertUtils.jsm
Line: 106

Apparently, version 10.0.7esr (and newer) checks the app.update.certs.x.commonName and app.update.certs.x.issuerName event though app.update.url.override is set.



Expected results:

The certificate checks should have been skipped since app.update.url.override is set.
This was the case in all versions we have tried including 10.0.6esr.

basically a dupe of bug 770594
IMHO this is not a dupe. 

These checks were enabled for Thunderbird (ESR) in changeset 9898:1d4617eeb9bd (http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-esr10/rev/1d4617eeb9bd) and the comments specifically states
"This validation will not be performed when using the |app.update.url.override| preference for update checking."
Apparently it does not work as the programmer intended since the checks are being performed even though we are using app.update.url.override.

The other bug deals with certificate validation through a proxy without having "app.update.url.override" set. But if this bug is fixed, I guess it could be used as a workaround for bug 770594.

I may be a bit confused, but even if the comment now states that app.update.override.url is only to be used for testing, the fact remains that the certificate checks are still performed when app.update.override.url is used. Either the code comment should be changed (again) to state that app.update.cert.checkAttributes is the only way to bypass certificate checks, or we need to investigate why app.update.override.url doesn't disable the checks.

It requires a user pref and not a default pref.

Ah. Thanks for clearing that up. I guess it would not hurt to clarify that in some documentation (mozillazine?) regarding the settings.
