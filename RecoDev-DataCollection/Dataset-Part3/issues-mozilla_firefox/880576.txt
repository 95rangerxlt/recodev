'none' is not a valid value for -moz-margin-end or -moz-margin-start. You probably want '0'.

Hehe, sometimes I need good bedtime reading material :-P
I guess the only questions that I have is that if this got checked in like this, and the 'none' value is ignored, did it need to be switched to '0' or could the lines have been deleted?
Mike, please see comment #3.

Ah yes, sorry about that; I wanted to delete the lines. KISS!
