We need to update this preference across all Firefox products:

pref("browser.safebrowsing.warning.infoURL", "https://www.mozilla.org/%LOCALE%/firefox/phishing-protection/");

New value:

Multi-review since this touches b2g/android/metro as well:

fabrice: b2g portion of the patch (just removing an unused-in-b2g pref)
dao: browser/ and toolkit/ changes
mbrubeck: browser/metro changes (these are untested, testing would be appreciated)
wesj: mobile/android changes (these are untested, testing would be appreciated)
