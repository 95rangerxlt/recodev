IIRC localizers don't have any way to set that width. If I'm right this bug should be in Firefox -> Preferences, since there's nothing localizers can't do to fix it.
Seems like we should set a min-width on the font dropdown. AFAICT the reason this works on en-US is that the text lower down in the dialog is forcing a wider dialog.
(we could add a width entity, but that doesn't port to 38)
Until we find a solution that we can uplift (as well as understand the root cause of this issue), can you try adding some non-breaking spaces to your locale files to give more width to the dialog? You could add them to the &languages.customize.Fallback2.grouplabel; and until you get a width that is desired.

Flod, could that work for JA? If so, do you know who to forward this to on the ja-locale side?
Abe, can you take a look this bug?
Tracking for 38+.
Any update here?

No problem on Firefox37
I wonder if the browser's window size matters. Also Alice's image uses Windows Classic theme, Abe's doesn't.

not reproduced when classic theme.
any conditions?
Please compare with width of other language and normal dialog version(prior to 37).
Font subdialog on Ja locale is much narrower than the others.

Bug1148923_firefox-39.0a2.en-US.png
indeed, ja locale is narrower than en-us.
but, does not look much narrow for me.

any concrete conditions?
classic, system font MS UI Gothic, size 11.
As preferences in-tab is a new feature (from the Release POV), it would be nice if this bug could be fixed for 38.

Min-width the font selectors

Arguably this is a pretty font+language-specific issue, but this fixes things to an acceptable degree for me (this is a patch against beta which I suspect will be easy to run on m-c as well). Tested against beta with the japanese language pack. Obviously if you have very long font names, 30ch is still not going to be enough, but it should be OK for most disambiguation.

(r?mconley because jaws isn't accepting reviews)

Looks good, this is a low-risk fix that we can uplift to beta.

Not waiting for the patch to be in m-c to make sure it is in 38 beta 5.
