See bug 330130 comment 7.
debug.js was originally included in globalOverlay.js but bug 330130 moved it out of there and #included it into browser.js.

It would be useful if debug.js were more available.

My particular interest is seeing it more available on the 1.8 branch. Right now it is not included in the scope of browser.xul on 1.8 branch while it is on trunk because the #include is in code ifdeffed MOZ_PLACES.

A simple start would be to move the include out of the ifdef making it always available.

Remove const declaration

The problem with having debug.js included in globalOverlay.js was that the second time it was included on Mac, the const declaration would fail. This patch simply removes the const declaration and re-includes debug.js in globalOverlay.js.

This is pretty low risk I think, it simply adds the function NS_ASSERT to globalOverlay.js.

It would be nice to have on the branch so it is in the same places as on trunk for extension developers.
