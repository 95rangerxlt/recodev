   $MOZ_OBJFORMAT is selected with "aout".
2. support amd64.

Okazaki-san, could you split bug into NSPR, NSS and mozilla?

Also, you should not attach diff of "configure" because some configure files are generated automatelly.

Okazaki-san, other code for freebsd/elf is checked in as bug 436806.  Could you test it? 
I can't test it since I can't get patched version from cvs,
but bug 436806's patch seems fine for me.

I patched by hand and tested bug 43806's patch,
FreeBSD/amd64 needs one more patch
 for  /cvsroot/mozilla/xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/Makefile.in.

Okazaki-san,
Although this patch is for *BSD, does it works on other BSD such as NetBSD/amd64 and Darwin/amd64??


I think they will work, but I didn't check it.
NetBSD's pksrc patch(pkgsrc/www/firefox3/patches/patch-ac) is 
also use xptcinvoke_x86_64_linux.cpp and xptcstubs_x86_64_linux.cpp 
for x86_64, so NetBSD/amd64 will have no problem.
It'll be more happy that pkgsrc's patches are imported.

a patch for FreeBSD/amd64

Should we rename *x86_64_linux.cpp to *x86_64_unixish.cpp like x86?
Also, *amd64_openbsd.cpp is same code of *x86_64_linux.cpp.  So if I have to rename x86_64_linux.cpp to x86_64-unixish.cpp, I should remove *amd64_openbsd.cpp and modify Makefile.in for OpenBSD too.
I agree with it.
