There are too many * and so on. How about:

----

[ ] Enable chrome debugging
[ ] Enable remote debugging
[ ] Disable JavaScript
    (This session only, will reload page)

----

When either of the first 2 are enabled we show an alert that says 'need to restart'.

The definition of 'session' is vague, but probably good enough to ensure people are not surprised.

Thoughts?

I agree. Although I think that the double dagger I added in bug 872670 might be actually useful (removes redundant text in case of multiple non supported tools) and its not an always visible thing too.
Enable chrome debugging and enable remote debugging both require a browser restart ... how would you like us to represent that?

We have many options:
- A notification door hanger, just like when you install a normal addon, it says restart now.
- A notification panel on toolbox with a button to restart
- A div at the bottom, just like IE's notification system, with a button to restart.

They would all happen after the checkbox is clicked and I think that being forewarned is better. I think that mixing the two methods will be fine, especially because "this session only" is only ever likely to be linked with one option:
[ ] Enable chrome debugging *
[ ] Enable remote debugging *
[ ] Disable JavaScript
    (This session only, will reload page)

* Requires restart

How does being forewarned make a difference? You click the checkbox, get a popup, and maybe a restart link appears. How is your life better/worse off compared to if you knew that you would have to restart before you clicked the checkbox?

On the other hand, having the text there slows everyone down because it gives you more to read.

My point was that people have a tendency not to read notifications and may be surprised when settings do not immediately take effect.
+1 for just adding a Restart link after toggling, and not cluttering up the panel before.

Maybe just add text right below the pref after toggling:
"This option requires a restart [Restart Now]"

Right, but I'm not sure we can't use "people don't read" as a reason to have more text.

Heather's solution is nice - possibly harder than an alert, but would look nicer, and due to the link, be easier to use.
I was thinking this : 
- A div at the bottom, just like IE's notification system, with a button to restart.

(the third option from my suggestions)

This should be :
- Catching enough  to get attention.
- Has the restart button to be helpful
- Is temporary, less clutter, clearly laid out to say that "restart is required"

Is there an advantage to putting the div at the bottom? Isn't that just further for your eye and mouse to travel?

How about this combination of all the ideas:

[ ] Disable JavaScript
    (This session only, will reload page)
[ ] Enable chrome debugging
[ ] Enable remote debugging
    <Browser restart required [Restart]>

(The section in <...> is hidden unless a browser restart is required, i.e. when the state of either of the 2 'enable ... debugging' checkboxes isn't what it was to start with)

+1 to Joe's suggestion.
