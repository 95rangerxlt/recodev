On the page(which is a form) at
http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=jrun, just enter an
e-mail address and choose the option "No, I will create now" and then click the
Continue button. Firebird crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=jrun
2. Enter e-mail address in the text field; select "No, I will create now" checkbox
3. Click the Continue button

Actual Results:  
The firebird window disappeared

Expected Results:  
Firebird should have gone to another page which would have been generated by the
browser as a result of pressing the Continue operation.

One important point to note. The same problem doesn't occur in Mozilla
(Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3) Gecko/20030314) on the same
system. Both had been compiled with gcc-3.? with Xft/gtk2 support. I downloaded
the pre-built binaries.

WFM winXP Gecko/20030913 Firebird/0.6.1+
and mozilla Gecko/20030910 

reporter, have you tried with a more recent version of mozilla? The comparison
between Firebird 20030901 & Mozilla 20030314 could mean that the problem is with
Firebird, or it could mean that it's started happening in the last 6 months.

Could be a linux-GTK2 issue.
No, it can't be a gtk2 issue, because Mozilla with Xft/Gtk2 support worked
correctly and rendered the page. 
Hey,

I got Mozilla Firebird 0.7 (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5)
Gecko/20031003 Firebird/0.7) with gtk2+xft support and the problem got solved !!
The next page is displayed correctly.
