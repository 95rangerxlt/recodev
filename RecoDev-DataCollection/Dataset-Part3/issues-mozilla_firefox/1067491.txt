jryans, this is the same actor patch(es) you reviewed in bug 960671, but I just want to rubber stamp it again since it is in a new bug now. I split the toggling of recording into a start and stop method, as you asked.

This is a combined patch of the allocations changes, the force GC/CC changes, and a tiny method exposing Debugger.Memory.prototype.takeCensus over the RDP. It was getting too hard to keep everything separate, sorry.

Still seems good to me!
Unless you're checking this in yourself, I think you should add a commit message to the patch.

Hrm, I can't repro locally. Digging into the test logs...

Ok just adding a check that the frame does exist in test_memory_allocations_01.html.

Let's see how this turns out: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=d00453950900
And I just realized I didn't include mochitest-chrome in that try push. Sigh...

Looks like adding that null check fixed it!
