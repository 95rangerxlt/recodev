-moz-border-radius on the network error pages renders nastily. Why not use
images instead, or just make the box square. 

Steps to reproduce:

2. when the error page shows, note the nasty aliased rounded corners on the info
box. ew.

I like the round corners, but they look a bit frayed indeed.
Possible Solution,

OBJECT use of a data: url for SVG, and a fallback to a data: url for png (this
to ensure it will "work" even if the build does not have SVG)
Complaint about aliasing: dupe of bug 16380?
But it looks like there are other rendering errors here -- the corners don't
even look evenly round.  Possible relation to bug 297937?

Not a core issue; netError is themed by whatever theme we have installed.  In fact, none of the CSS is in core.
Note, in current Cairo based builds the rounded corners are nicely 'anti-aliased' and no longer 'nasty aliased', so we can close this bug now?
