Providers can indicate content to be shown when one of the notification area icons is clicked - but not when the profile portrait is clicked.

Simplest would be to allow a new field - eg, 'portraitClickUrl' to the social.ambient-notification-area message (which already includes the URL of the portrait itself).  One downside of this though is that the provider doesn't get flexibility about how to show that URL - eg, they may want it shown in a popup panel like the other buttons (and conversely, some providers may not want the other buttons to be shown in a popup panel but instead in a new tab).  IOW, there may be a case for unifying all the URLs in the ambient area to be both consistent and flexible.

Assigning to Mike in the first instance to make a decision on the API.

this is related to the design in bug 763837.  I've pushed profile capability on the xulmenu branch, https://github.com/mozilla/socialapi-dev/commit/33d969b2cc9164b6773ffcbe1696299516f41bb6

As well, motown is sending the data to support this.  For ms1 at least, we can just open the profileURL in a tab.
for bug 765874 we'll need a larger profile image, and make sure displayName and userName are part of the profile request.
docs updated to reflect new profile data and status icon use.
