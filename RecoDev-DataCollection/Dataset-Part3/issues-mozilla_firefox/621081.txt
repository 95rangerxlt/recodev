The new icon for Web feed for Linux introduced in bug 596731 has a couple of issues:

- it doesn't have any visual disabled state when there is no feed in the page (contrary to Windows and Mac) which makes it useless on Linux and not light visually
- the image used is no longer the same as in 3.6, it uses the big square one which looks 'bulky' compared to icons we usually use in the toolbar menu. We should use the one 3.6 had and that we also use in the bookmarks menu

I am going to attach a patch for gnomestripe.css that fixes those issues (note that it is the first time that I do a patch for our software, I hope I did it correctly ;) )

I compiled Minefield with this patch on Ubuntu 10.10 and it works and looks good on a variety of themes I tried (Radiance, Clearlook, Ambiance, Hight contrast...).

I am going to also attach before/after screenshots.

patch to gnomestripe.css changing the icon and setting a disabled state
CCing a few people in front end realm, guys who should I ask a review for this patch?

It would probably be better to update the image in Toolbar.png instead of re-using the other image (whose size is different for large icons). Otherwise that patch looks good to me.

temporary solution

Current icons will be changed soon, so skip creating new icons and just set opacity for icon. I'll remove this line in bug 572484.
Pascal, feel free to file a new bug on using a different icon.
