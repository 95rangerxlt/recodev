We hang a TabItem off of xul:tabs, and currently we do it with the property "tabItem", but this is too generic for the context. I propose we change it to "_tabViewTabItem" to identify what it is, where it's from, and that it's not for general consumption.

If we're going to take an opportunity to rename things, though, why not _panoramaTabItem? Most code references are to TabView, now, but that may get confusing in the long run... might as well start to switch over now?
"tabview" seems alright as an internal name. I don't see us replacing all its occurrences with "panorama".
Raymond: ping?

Dao: I agree with keeping "tabview" and change tab.tabItem to tab._tabViewTAbItem.
Alright, are you going to write the patch?
Not at the moment, since it's a not blocker.
This should be done asap (in fact, it shouldn't have landed this way), since the later it gets done the more extensions will be affected.
You are right.  Let me work on this next then.

Looks great!
It would be nice to land this as soon as we can.  As mentioned in comment #7, the later it gets done the more extensions will be affected.
We've already told add-on authors that we're frozen; I'm fine taking this, but I would like to see a blog post explaining what's changed or some outreach to add-on developers.

Adding Jorge.

Jorge: Basically, we change a name of the reference from tab.tabItem to tab._tabViewTabItem.  Extensions can access the panorama data related to a browser browser using tab._tabViewTabItem instead of tab.tabItem.

Though it should be noted that this is no blessed API.

We should probably add a TabView.getItemForTab method.

Definitely. Work on "a real API" has been punted past fx4.

This doesn't seem to belong in this bug.
This might be worth a mention on the Firefox 4 MDC page.
Hm, this is not presently documented at all. Any design notes or anything for the panorama view from a developer standpoint I can use to add reference docs for this stuff?

Unfortunately we never got around to making an official API, so everything that's in Panorama is subject to change in the future. That said, our code documentation is here:

Let me know if you have questions.
