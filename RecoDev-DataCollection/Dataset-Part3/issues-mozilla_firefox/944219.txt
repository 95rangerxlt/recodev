Not sure why it's not hitting tbpl, but it started up on every local test run for me a few days ago.  The issue is that we often hide the sidebar in our tests, so the content view is not actually unloaded, "leaking" the last document in the sidebar.  The fix is to call "browser.docShell.createAboutBlankContentViewer(null);" after setting src to about:blank.
