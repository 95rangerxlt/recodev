hi Nicholas, if you have any questions about add-on support for multiprocess Firefox (e10s), just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

The developer has been contacted through AMO.
Hello,

I am a software engineer at Pearltrees and I am in charge of resolving this bug.
Even if my team mate reproduced this bug a week ago, I am unable to reproduce it today.

I have just installed the last version of Nightly (37.0a1 Dec 7th), e10s enabled, and I installed our addon in it (multithread enabled with the tag multiprocessCompatible at true in install.rdf). To my surprise, it worked perfectly.

Do you still reproduce this bug on the last nightly build? Does someone have a logical explanation, I would not like to see this bug coming back again at the February release.

Best regards.

Nhat Cuong Nguyen
The add-on appears to be working normally on nightly.
