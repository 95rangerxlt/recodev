when migrating from IE6 to firefox0.8+, the proxy settings are not corectly 
migrated. if my proxy is 192.168.68.1 and port is 8080,
firefox will migrate the following : proxy is 192.68.68.1:8080 and port is 8080

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set IE as default browser and install firefox. 
2.Open a clean new profile and firefox will migrate your IE settings.
3.Open the options dialog in firefox and go to the connection settings.

Actual Results:  
instead of proxy is 192.168.68.1 and port is 8080, firefox says proxy is 
192.168.68.1:8080 and port is 8080

Expected Results:  
connection settings in firefox should say:
proxy is 192.168.68.1 and port is 8080

Same problem witnessed here at work.  I'll vote for the bug.
We're actually dying here, although I can't figure out why myself:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/migration/src/nsBrowserProfileMigratorUtils.cpp#48


This affects migration from any browser, not just IE.  This might even be
all/all, but I haven't played with migration from other platforms yet.

Tested on IE 6 and Opera 7.5 migrators.
does this actually prevent the proxy from functioning or is it a cosmetic issue?

> does this actually prevent the proxy from functioning or is it a cosmetic issue?

Definitely, it will prevent the proxy from functioning. You will have to set the
proxy yourself manually. 


this is definitely a blocker then.  (And probably all/all, but I still haven't
tested that yet).
be aware this is a problem in Trunk and Branch (tried both)!

Created attachment 149132
use cautostrings instead of dependentcstrings

We do need to copy into nsCAutoStrings here because we need null termination.
Otherwise when we feed the result of Substring() into nsDependentCString's ctor
it asserts because the length it thinks its receiving (mLength) is not the same
length as the buffer (the full proxy segment).
This bug was introduced by 237190. The copy doesn't bother me so much since this
is not a performance critical operation. Fixed branch and trunk.

propose REOPENED
i/o displaying http://proxyname/:portnumber (which was wrong)
it now displays http://proxyname/ which does not work either.

only proxyname without http:// and without ending / does work
er, where'd the trailing / come from?

all this code does is take http://foo.bar:1080 and separate it to http://foo.bar
and 1080, if the original is http://foo.bar/:1080 and it should parse that
trailing slash out, that's a separate bug (although the question is how did that
work in the first place in the other browser?)
I allways had to remove the http:// part (also in 0.7 and 0.8)
additiional comment
I checked the settings here and the sysop had the proxyserver defined as 
http://servername/ (in IE).
IE doesn't seem to care , like in so many cases.
I don't know if FF shouldn't strip the http:// off if it's malconfigured in IE ?
But this bug can remain fixed.

If needed I can open a new bug for it, but only if it won't get a WONTFIX 
offcourse.
advice please.
if IE allows it, but we don't, then we do need to strip the hostname out of the
string.  Please file said bug and cc me on it :)
