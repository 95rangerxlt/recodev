When right-clicking any item in the back button menu, an obsolete back button menu opens at the point that was clicked.

I think this is obsolete and doesn't belong here.

The issue is that it's registering that click for the underlying back arrow which displays the menu on right-click.

Is this WONTFIX then?

Is that a regression from 3.6?

Looks like one. When I click on an item in this dropdown in 3.6, no additional menu is opened.
Would be great if you could check for the regression range.

From the pushlog it looks like the patch for Bug 582485 caused this.

Margarete, would that make sense to you?
That makes sense, but I can't reproduce this problem on OSX. It seems like the patch in bug 582485 probably exposed some underlying platform-specific issue, since the main thing it did was just take out some "#ifdef XP_MACOSX" lines.

I don't understand this patch. Where does this element get a non-empty "context" attribute (it's not defined in the XUL)? Why does "context" on a menupopup have any effect to begin with?
#unified-back-forward-button has context="backForwardMenu". The cloned popups don't have a context attribute set without this patch.
Seems odd that menupopups inherit "context" from their parents (particularly when they are themselves a context menu...). Shouldn't we fix that?
Also, why doesn't this affect other menupopups similarly? Is it because the click-and-hold code opens the popup manually?
The cloned popups don't act as context menus. This actually affects other popup menus, like the all-tabs dropdown menu.

I can't seem to reproduce this bug anymore (tried Linux/Mac/Windows). Can someone else confirm?
I can easily reproduce this on Windows.

I am using the 5/17/11 Nightly and do NOT experience this issue any more, as shown in the original uploaded video from comment 0.  When right-clicking the Back Button, you correctly receive the list of previously opened tabs.  Now, if I right-click on one of those entries, Nightly doesn't generate another list of previous tabs, but instead takes me to that page.  If THIS right-click action to take me to the page listed is in fact a bug (and only the left-click should be enabled here), let me know and I will file it on Bugzilla.

In case it helps.....I am running Windows 7 64-Bit (but the 32-Bit version of Nightly = http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f717485edc51).

I see this too. I even tested all of WinXP/Vista/Win7.
You hold the back button for the menu to appear, then you right-click the menu. I think this bug is just wrongly summarized.
Well, the summary isn't even wrong after all... I just failed to read it properly.

And I can reproduce this on Linux as well.

The behavior described in Comment 18 is still reproducible. Is this ok?
