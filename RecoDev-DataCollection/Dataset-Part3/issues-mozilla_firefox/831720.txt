Boiling Kevin's Docs down:

    Fixing errors
        Manifest missing
        Manifest parse error
        Bad mime type
        Missing resource
        cache-control: no-store wrongly set
        changing manifest file (kevin's #6)
        forgot to update manifest
        forgot to refresh a second time
    Additional errors
        When SSL, same-origin policy
    Confidence that it's working
        what came from the appcache?


Solution:

    Fixing errors
        Should be handled by web-console/log messages and "appcache show" command
    Displaying what we've got (appcache show)
    Manipulating the data
        appcache clear
        appcache edit (not needed for kevin's problems)
    Helping with getting it right
        appcache advise


Commands:

    appcache show
        If invalid:
            Explanation as to why (last error)
            Correction advice
            Links to MDN
            With 'retry' button
        If it's valid:
            Output a table containing the obvious URL|Type|Size columns
            With 'clear' button
    appcache help
        Links to MDN
        Advice if status is invalid
    appcache clear
        --all (?)

Do we need to surface a button in the toolbar?

Patch v1

We had to trim the tool back because some things are not possible using the current appcache service.

The tests don't run through as a batch so we will need to wait on bug 864834 to fix that but there is no reason not to review this patch.

There are changes to helper.js that we will need to move out to GCLI as discussed.

These 5 lines are fairly much duplicates from above - we could have just a doTest function that contains this 'if' statement?

I think we should get used to the pattern:
  let { X } = Cu.import("...", {});

No need to change it, but I'm not keen on the magic of Cu.import, and IIRC the magic is nasty because sometimes it imports more than you want.

I think it's worth a comment about why we couldn't use the system manifest parser here. There is a risk of the 2 getting out of date.

We're going to need l10n comments here?
I suspect that bug 864834 might not get any love any time soon. We can try having the valid test run first and the valid one running second. Failing that we should disable the valid test until bug 864834 is fixed.

You are right. I have now fixed this so that there is only doTest()

I have changed it just to help me get into the habit. In fact, I discovered that we didn't need NetUtil.jsm

Yes, there is no need for that function to be bound.

Done.

I also have the tests working using:
http://sub1.test1.example.com
http://sub1.test2.example.com

We need to hold off landing to fix a possible test issue.

Fixed security check and removed backwards compatibility issue

In the past few days a change landed that moves the offline data notification from the notification bar to a doorhanger which broke these tests. jwalker also discovered a small backwards compatibility issue in helpers.js.

These issues are now fixed.

Created attachment 744650
Removed inverse property and used post

We have now removed the inverse property and used post as this is far more useful for complex tests.

I have also improved feedback when comparing strings to output (this was skipped on passes and the actual text was missing on test failures).
