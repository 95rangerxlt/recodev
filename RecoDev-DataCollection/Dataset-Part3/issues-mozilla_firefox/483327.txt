bug 390734 reduced the padding and margin used by groupboxes and now there is some extra room in the options pref window.

I'm going to also fix a bug with animateFadeIn=true on Windows where the tabpanel bottom border isn't displayed.

This seems to make the window too small over here:

1. open the Options window
2. select "Content"
3. close the Options window
4. open the Options window
5. select "General"

-> the window gets taller

And this could use a more useful comment :)
It's pretty clear that it's about the Advanced pane, but it's not obvious what you're doing there, and why.
Which windows version / theme are you using. With or without animateFadeIn?

No problem adding a comment about why but I want to keep the section header since that seems to be the standard in this file so people can tell what prefpane it refers to... makes it easier for those that don't work with this file often.
The STR didn't show a problem for me on Vista.

Can I see a screenshot?
Also wasn't able to reproduce on Vista with Classic.
Windows XP, Luna, animateFadeIn=false. Sure you need a screenshot? Opening the window with a pane other than "General" and switching to "General" makes the window taller -- not much to see otherwise.
The difference is 9 pixels... from 434 to 443.
