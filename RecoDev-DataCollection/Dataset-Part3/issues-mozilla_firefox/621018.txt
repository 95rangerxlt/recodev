these tests should define extensions.webservice.discoverURL to something local if they really need to access about:addons

No network access please!

The toolkit one is fine, because of http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/test/browser/head.js#42

The fun part is that whether or not other ones are fine depends on the order the tests run in, since that clears the other two prefs it sets, but not that one.

I like it and I'd like to say yes, but really if we're just setting the pref and wanting it to stay set for hte lifetime of the tests then we should just do so in automation.py.in. I probably should have put it there in the first place.

Sigh. I thought I remembered seeing where we set some server prefs, but I didn't see it in runtests.py, so I just applied the power of my clipboard instead of my mind.

browser_discover.js depends on PREF_DISCOVERURL being defined so define it there but otherwise this looks good.
