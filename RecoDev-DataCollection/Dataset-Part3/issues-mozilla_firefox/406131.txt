I'll be in an airplane in the morning, but will be back online by mid afternoon. The message I left on Tinderbox is below:

This failure does not correlate to any check-in that I've been able to find. It's likely that the root cause of the problem is the test box, but clobbers and reboots did not fix it. I'm leaving the tree closed until build/QA can look into it in the AM, as I'm not comfortable re-opening the tree while there are known and repeatable test failures. Some more info:

    * The same 30 tests were failing on qm-win2k3-01 earlier in the day, and that was fixed by a reboot+clobber. This strategy did not work for qm-winxp01.

    * The same mochitests are not failing locally. However, 45 other tests are, so I have no trust in these local results.

Has a full sourcetee clobber been done?
Upon thinking further on this, it would probably not be a bad idea to do this
on both windows unit test machines.

Force them to both do a complete pull of the current source tree and start over
from that.  I think it is important to get them both reporting the same thing
either pass or failure so we know if there is a real issue to look for.

Both of these machines had a full source tree clobber + reboot. This fixed qm-win2k3-01 but not qm-winxp01
Robcee's full clobber seems to have fixed this.
