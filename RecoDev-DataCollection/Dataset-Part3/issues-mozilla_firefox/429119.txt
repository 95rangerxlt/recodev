If Firefox is not the default browser and Firefox is set to check if it is the default then the menu bar will not be visible on startup.  As a result no keyboard shortcuts will work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure Firefox is not default browser
2. Enable 'Always check to see if Firefox is the default browser on startup' is checked
3. Quit Firefox and relaunch
4. Click 'No' on the dialog box
Actual Results:  
Firefox appears with the menu bar missing and keyboard shortcuts are broken

Expected Results:  
Menu bar visible

David: I don't see the menu bar missing using when I follow your STR using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008041504 Minefield/3.0pre. Can you make sure you try it in safe mode and see if the same thing occurs? 
Marcia: The same behaviour occurs in safe mode too.  I was running FF3b5, but I have just tried it using 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008041504 Minefield/3.0pre' (normal & safe-mode) and am getting the same behaviour (although now the "Make firefox default...." dialog box is appearing mostly off the top of the top left of the screen).

The Minefield/Firefox menu item is visible but File, Edit etc. are missing (and the associated keyboard shortcuts located in there).

I don't have another Mac to test this at the moment but I'll try to replicate it elsewhere.
David: The off screen dialog box is Bug 424266. I will test again and see if I am able to reproduce what you see. 
Marcia:  I just checked the offscreen bug which has a video showing the behaviour.  That video also contains the behaviour I am experiencing.  The menu items reappear if focus is taken away from Firefox and then returned.
