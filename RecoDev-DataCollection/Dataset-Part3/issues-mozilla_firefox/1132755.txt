"total time" ?? This is allocations, not CPU profiling, what is being timed?

"total cost" not even sure what this is -- time percentage?

Same goes for self time and self cost.

"samples" this is clearly different from count, but I wouldn't expect it to be

I think we should only have:

* Self allocation "count" and percentage

* Total allocation "count" and percentage

But "count" is misleading because it is only the times we sampled an allocation, not the actual number of times an allocation happened. Total allocations ~= sampled allocations x (1 / sample rate), but I'm not sure we want to display that to the user. Perhaps just percentages, and relabeling "counts" as "sampled allocations".
