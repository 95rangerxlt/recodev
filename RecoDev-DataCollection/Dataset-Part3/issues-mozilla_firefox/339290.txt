unable to paste links into the organize bookmarks dialog

I know this is a regression (but not sure since when) and I think there is a dup in bugzilla, but I couldn't find it (yet).

The fix is very simple, and I found this bug while working on bug #315690 (in an attempt to see if CloneResource() was the culprit of that bug.)

I'll attach the low risk fix.

unable to paste links into the organize bookmarks dialog

I know this is a regression (but not sure since when) and I think there is a dup in bugzilla, but I couldn't find it (yet).

The fix is very simple, and I found this bug while working on bug #315690 (in an attempt to see if CloneResource() was the culprit of that bug.)

I'll attach the low risk fix.
the fix (on my work machine) is something like this to bookmarks.js:

-// XXX: we should infer the best charset
-BookmarksUtils.createBookmark(null, items, null, name, null);
-items = [items];

+// XXX: we should infer the best charset
+var createdBookmarkResource = BookmarksUtils.createBookmark(null, items, null, name, null);
+items = [createdBookmarkResource];

the code expects items to be an array of RDF resources, and not an array of strings.

later, we will get a JS exception when we try to do items[0].Value (because we expect it to be a RDF literal.)

this fix solves that problem, I'll attach a proper diff once I get my tree building at home.

I think your analysis is correct, but I'm really not qualified to review this patch. I'm not sure who I would suggest as a reviewer, maybe mconnor or vlad?

fix checked into the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH branch

note to QA:  to test this, try right clicking on a link and pasting into the bookmark manager dialog.

note, if we have it (in your history) we will use the page title as the name of the bookmark.
the trunk also seems to have this bug, but for a different reason.

the paste item is disabled (and note, when I do ctrl+v I get "###!!! ASSERTION: NOT IMPLEMENTED: '0', file c:/builds/trunk/mozilla/layout/base/nsDocumentViewer.cpp, line 2560" on my console)

I think it might be better to spin up another bug on this issue for places on the trunk.
fyi, in order to keep trunk in sync with the 1.8 branch, I've landed this change on the trunk as well.
Was a bug filed on the similar issue with Places?

oops, I forgot to do that.  Thank you for the reminder.  See bug #341953
oops, I never marked this as fixed (even though it was on the branch.)

the fix was cross committed to trunk (even though it uses places), but this is still an issue with places, see bug #341953
