On mac, if all windows are closed, Apple+T (or any tab-opening function) should open a new window to accommodate this new tab being opened. This is likely related to all of the other 'links from other apps don't open if no windows are open already'-bugs as well. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the browser. 
2. Close all windows, do not quit the application.
3. Press Apple+T and wonder where your new tab is.

Actual Results:  
No tabs, just disappointment, sadness and gloom. 

Expected Results:  
A new window pops up with focus on the address bar. Maybe not filled with your home page, but with a preference.newtab.starturl shown.

Experienced with Minefield, but I recall it being the case with all of tab-enabled firefox versions...

Confirming and taking. It's annoying behavior and easy to fix.

The bug is also mentioned in John Gruber's comparison of Safari and Firefox: http://daringfireball.net/2008/04/firefox_3_safari_3

Fix v1.0: Don't disable "File » New Tab" when no window is visible
Note that I made Cmd+T open a blank window. You can still press Cmd+N if you want a window loading the home page. Safari does the same.
Sounds perfect, can't wait to test it. Home page auto-loading is a nuisance.
