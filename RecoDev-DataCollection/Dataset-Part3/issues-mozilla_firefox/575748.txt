We are now running the Windows 7 unit tests on production but hidden.

This is one of the 4 test suites left to greenize on Windows 7 and we want to
make this green as soon as it is possible to help us move load from the Win2k3
machines to the Win7 machines (it will really help us). Any help that you can
give us will be really appreciate it since this block us to roll this goal out.

Do we know when this started?
I enabled these test suites last Thursday and have been orange since.
Any updates?
*** Bug 580141 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Test has been disabled in http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/9ba3b1ad7377
Created attachment 458619
patch

This seems to fix it on OS X, I suppose it'll do it on Win7 as well. I don't understand why it failed in the first place, though.
Something similar has happened before to me in another test (I think it was for the toolbar buttons), I needed to add the "1, 1" to SynthesizeMouse or whatever. If it works, it should totally be pushed...
I'm not seeing this failure in the current logs at:
http://tests.themasta.com/tinderboxpushlog/?noignore=1
for the "Mo (oth)" build on the Win7 line.

However, the test runs may be failing before they finish, so it could be covered up by an earlier failure.

I disabled the test since it started failing on OS X. The attached patch intends to fix and re-enable the test.

That's not this bug.
