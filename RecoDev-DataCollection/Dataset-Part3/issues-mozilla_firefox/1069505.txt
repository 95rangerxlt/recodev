Thanks for your help.
The developer has been contacted through AMO. The add-on hasn't been updated in over two years, though.
The add-on was updated. However, the dropdown you mention seems to be related to the changes in the Australis theme rather than e10s. According to the add-on page, there's a different add-on you should use if you want the right look.
