With the infobar landed from bug 663833, when scrolling a webpage with a node "locked" in the highlighter, the infobar "chases" the node around. We should disable the transition during scrolling.

The transition is kinda nice when the infobar swaps positions relative to the highlighter box.
yes, but not so much during scrolling. Probably a low priority bug for now.
I don't quite see the problem... when I'm scrolling with a locked node, the transition seems to make it easier to not lose track of the infobar.

This makes the infobar consistent with the highlight rectangle: both have no transitions once the node is locked. Thanks, r+!
