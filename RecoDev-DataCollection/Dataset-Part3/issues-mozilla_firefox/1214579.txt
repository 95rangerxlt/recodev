This is on current fx-team tip, so it includes all the other followup fixes, but it looks completely busted. I don't understand why yet. I was under the impression this was supposed to have been fixed in bug 1214244, but it doesn't seem to have been.

It looks like this is because there is no width or height being set on the back/fwd buttons at all, and on retina their imagery is too big, and so now they stretch because of that, leading to all the other bustage.
