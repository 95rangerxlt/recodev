Pierre, you might want to take a look at attachment 127363 a chrome
trace-report, which should yield some interesting information. Also take a look
at attachment 127430 and attachment 127431 (the script and the header file,
which generated the report).
Thanks to the passage of time, this is now just xbl-marquee, and the cookie accept dialog.
And, while the cookie accept dialog can be utterly painlessly moved to toolkit.jar, xbl-marquee is a little more tangled up in the tree, and, at this point this bug is pointless: we need both of the remaining things in there, and moving them both to toolkit.jar looks like it would pick us up a mighty 400 *bytes* of .jar overhead. Uncompressed.

patch

Bug 468011 is trying to consolidate the jars.
This is finally removing comm.jar.
Tested that the cookie accept dialog and <marquee> still work.

what do you mean by tangled up?
Wrong tense: the right tense for "mean (in February 2007) by tangled up?" is "did." Without an mxr indexing 1.9a2, dunno, probably something a bit like http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/search?string=xbl-marquee since SeaMonkey would have still been using the old installer, and embedding wouldn't have looked quite so abandoned back then.
