When platform bug 1120339 gets resolved, we'll be able to control animations' playback rate via AnimationPlayer objects.
Which means we'll be able to expose this to devtools users through the animation inspector panel.

When platform bug 1120339 gets resolved, we'll be able to control animations' playback rate via AnimationPlayer objects.
Which means we'll be able to expose this to devtools users through the animation inspector panel.
When bug 1120339 is fixed, the UI will first need to check that the setPlaybackRate method exists on the actor (as the rest of the feature detection is done on the front-end).
Also, on top of adding a UI control to change the rate, this same control should correctly the current rate when the player widget is first displayed (the rate could have been changed in content prior to the widget being displayed).
My plan is to add a small drop-down button next to the play/pause, rewind, fforward buttons. It would show the current rate, and on click would display a list of presets to choose from.

Ship It!
Landed part 1: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/2bb927ec6786
I have no idea how to use mozreview. You damn kids and your new tools that I need to learn. 

Consider this an r+.
Backing out the other animation inspector changes that landed prior to this made tests angry. Backed out to try to get things green again.

Relanded part 1 to fx-team, which only contains a really minor html/css styling change to the animation panel and was not related to yesterday's backout.
