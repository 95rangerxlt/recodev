this page crashes Firebird consistently.
Does not crash mozilla! 
It has pointers to Adobe to download svg viewer
and has SVG images on the page.  I suspect this
is where the problem is. ;-[ ;-[  there should be
some kind of catch for this. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download page
2. Observe crash
3. Since not graceful crash, a windows restart is needed

Actual Results:  
Angry words ! Hair pulling ! 

Expected Results:  
mozilla is ok --- firebird is not!!

And i thought that i could test by installing the plug-in!
So i used mozilla's menu which branched to 
plugindoc.mozilla.org   which refused a connection
so if i cant get help from mozilla.org   who am i supposed
to turn to. the svgview.exe is on my machine and clicking on 
it gives report that it is now installed  but it doesnt
show up on either mozilla or firebird plug-in list  RATS!!

WFM,  Reporter: can you download a latest nightly build from
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/latest-trunk/ install it
into a new empty directory and then report back on if you still get this bug?
Thanks!
testing on december 18  with mozilla dec 17 nightly
and firebird dec 16 nightly indicates that there is
no longer a crash on accessing this page without the
appropriate plugin. Thank you. Marking as resolved!
