The tap-to-click functionality supported by the track-pads in most laptops does not work in Firefox (at least since 3.5) on Silverlight content. It works in Internet Explorer and in Google Chrome on Windows, and in Firefox and Safari on Mac OS X.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure tap-to-click is enabled on your track-pad;
2. Tap a check box (or a button, or a combo box - lots of possibilities).
Actual Results:  
The check box is not checked (the button is not clicked, the combo box doesn't show its items, etc.).

Expected Results:  
The check box is checked (the button is clicked, the combo box shows its items, etc.).

The standard click works just fine.
