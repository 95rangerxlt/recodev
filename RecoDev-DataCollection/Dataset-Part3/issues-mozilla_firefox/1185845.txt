This is a landing from bug 1171344
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/b2a96402ed45/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/search.properties

It's really bad from a localization point of view.

> searchFor=Search for 
> searchWith= with:

1) Unless I'm mistaken, whitespaces before and after the separator are simply ignored unless they're in escaped form.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/Tutorial/Property_Files#Escape_non-ASCII_Characters

2) Concatenations are bad.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_content_best_practices#Avoid_concatenations_use_placeholders_instead

Unless the are huge technical limitations, we should avoid them at all costs and use something like "Search for #1 with:", and replace #1 with whatever needed.

> searchWithHeader=Search with:

Is this concatenated with the name of the searchengine? Having said that concatenations are bad, if you decide to take that road you always need to provide a "before" and "after" string. Not having that forces a grammar structure on other languages.

Side note: escaped spaces are pretty confusing, and might confuse some tools too.
Some context on why it was done this way in bug 1171344:
The design specified in bug 1106057 has the query text styled differently than the rest of the string. It is probably possible to format the string by replacing the "#1" or whatever with HTML code (rather unclean but it would work), but there was precedent in the main searchbox code so we went the concatenation route.

As for the searchWithHeader - no, there is no concatenation going on there. It stays as "Search with:".

This is the involved code, isn't it?

I don't think replacing the placeholder with the <span> HTML code would be that awful.

Thanks (missed the UX design in bug 1106057, so couldn't figure out how this was actually used).
Also realized that "Change Search Settings" is hard-coded

That's embarrassing.

Thanks! String-wise it looks good, only one localization comment to update.

Need to update this comment too.
