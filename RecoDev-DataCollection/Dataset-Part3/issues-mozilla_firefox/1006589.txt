Whenever you're paused in the debugger, the corresponding line has a blue background, referred to as the "debug location". This highlight can get lost when hovering identifiers, because hovering stuff may perform an evaluation, which blows away the stack. Blowing away the stack removes the debug location, and we're relying on setting it again when the new frames are retrieved. However, this doesn't always happen.

this improves readability quite a bit.

Hi Victor,
sorry had to backout this cset from m-c (and will also backout from the other integrations trees) because it seems the test is very fragile and so we have frequent test failures like https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=39252805&tree=Mozilla-Central
Backout: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/2a03b34c8953
Hopefully the test is fixed now: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a85a5e855e3d
Relanded: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/57430c4db8bd
