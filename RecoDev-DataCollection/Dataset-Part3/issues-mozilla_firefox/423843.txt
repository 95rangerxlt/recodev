Is this extension using a binary component? If so, it's passing null for a string argument, which would be a bug in the extension.

If it isn't using a binary component, then what is the JS code that is being called when it crashes?

Tomcat, can you get a C++ stack trace for the assertion?
Never mind, timeless says the JS stack (DumpJSStack) is more useful for this bug than the C++ stack.
for reference
components/ilUtilService.js:109
        value=this.RDF.GetLiteral(value);

tomcat provided the correct stack. however it's a bug in the extension, so it should be in some other product.
timeless agrees with the bug 421720 comment 7 doctrine ("abusing a scriptable API should not trigger assertions"), but thinks there's already a bug report about this assertion being bogus, so he decided that this bug report should be about fixing the extension.
All right, i see the problem.

I've made a fix, it is available at http://www.subtile.net/subtile-1.3b1.xpi

If someone can verify the error does not appear anymore, i'll submit version 1.3 of Subtile to addons.mozilla.org.

Hi Michel, i don't see this assertion with your 1.3b1 version of subtiles. So verified fixed. Thanks everyone for the great work here.
