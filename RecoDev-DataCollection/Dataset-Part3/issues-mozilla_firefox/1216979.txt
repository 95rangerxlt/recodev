Similarly to bug 1188413, we should add a key shortcut to reload WebIDE (and devtools resources) from local checkout.
Today, we have to either reboot firefox or close/reopen WebIDE(with all modules not being reloaded) or go to firefox window and ALT+CTRL+R and close/reopen WebIDE.
This is too much, instead we could replicate the same key binding in WebIDE and have it to just reload the modules and WebIDE document.

This patch replicated the same binding.
I had to tweak Loader.jsm's reload as
this method can also be called from toolboxes within WebIDE.
So I had to ensure that we don't try to reload a toolbox in background
if we hit the binding from WebIDE's toolbox.
The additional binding in WebIDE allows to reload WebIDE without a toolbox.

Also, it looks like toolboxes don't reload correctly (not always but seems quite frequent).
Not in WebIDE, but in firefox, connected to a e10s tab,
CTRL+ALT+R often ends up with a blank toolbox.
Adding a 1s timeout fix it. I wish I could come up with a better fix,
but I don't want to dive into yet another toolbox mess.

As for bug 1217559, this patch fixes the hot reload feature.
We have to wait before trying to reopen a new toolbox.
And it makes the magic key binding to work in WebIDE.

I'm not a big fan of the setTimeout, but listening to all possible destructions events sounds like a big hassle that may easily fail.

Great, it seems to work well with this patch and bug 1217559 applied.

We can always improve past setTimeout in the future.
