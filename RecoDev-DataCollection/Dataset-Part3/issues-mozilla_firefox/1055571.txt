It is already possible to utilize ToolSidebar object and create side bars in new or existing Toolbox panels. It's also possible to create new side-panels, but there is now API to remove them.

The implementation should happen in:
browser/devtools/framework/sidebar.js

Suggested patch, couple of comments:

1) New removeTab method implemented
2) Use event.target to get win+doc from the loaded iframe. iframe.contentDocument isn't set if the iframe is being loaded in hidden <tabbox> (could be related to bug 1056033)

Joe, I saw you did the original implementation of the code, so asking for review.

Changes look good overally - can you add a case in devtools/framework/test/browser_toolbox_sidebar.js to cover this new API?

You could call `let panel = this.getTab(id)`
