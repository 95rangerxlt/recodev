does this change make more difficult distinguish selected tab from background tabs?
now background tabs are darker in the upper while selected is lighter, so it's easy to dinstinguishe them because there is a clear colour change.

with this change selected and background are lighter in the upper, background tab is only a little less light.

i think that backgroun tabs thould have an inverted gradient so selected tab is lighter to darker, while background tab is darker to lighter.

Sounds scary to me... now how do you distinguish hovered from selected tabs?

I need to test this one out...

The active tab is connected to the bottom strip. Looks good to me.

Yeah, after playing with this, my concerns are gone; this is a good change.
