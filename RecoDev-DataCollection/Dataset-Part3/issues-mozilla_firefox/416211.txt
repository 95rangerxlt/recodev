If you tag a page and change the title, autocomplete doesn't show the bookmarked title if you match on the tag. However, it will show the bookmark title if you match against the bookmark (and not the tag).

This will be fixed by bug 414287. I'll attach a testcase to this bug.

This does not block the final release of Firefox 3.
Created attachment 302174
testcase v1

I'll land this when bug 414287 and bug 414426 lands.
This will be fixed by bug 401660 if bug 414426 doesn't land.
