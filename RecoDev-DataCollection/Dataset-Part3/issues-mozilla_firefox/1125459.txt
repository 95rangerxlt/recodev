These show some of the late e-mails. Please note the date and time.
Sorry, I forgot to add, All other e-mail (ads, apam . . . .) no delays.
This was fall out from bug 969182 - upgrade sumo servers to python 2.7. The celery servers (which among other things, send email) didn't get fully updated, and so weren't sending emails for about 22 hours. Once we fixed them, the emails all came out at once. Assuming you are in US eastern time, the time you got the flood of emails corresponds to when we fixed the issue.

This was fixed earlier today. It isn't an ongoing problem. Thanks for the bug report though!
