Currently, the items that are not yet in the panel or the toolbars appear once the transition into customization mode is finished.
We should fade them in instead for ~0.3s (lengthening the overall transition time if that is necessary) in order to make the entire transition look smoother.

Drive-by - I think this is going to hurt our CART results.

I think we should still apply hidden=false/hidden=true to the palette. Apply hidden=false, and then set the showing attribute, and then *maybe* we'll want to have a transitionend listener on the palette, and yield until that transition completes.

Same for the exit transition - remove the showing attribute, yield until the transition completes, and then hide the palette for better performance.

We get better performance because hidden removes the palette from the flow of the document, meaning layout doesn't have to worry about it anymore.

mconley's feedback is good, looking forward to a revised patch :)

The second version of the patch.

Let's try this instead.  :)

(I'm not using requestAnimationFrame because that doesn't give the dom enough time to be updated, and so the opacity doesn't transition.)

Mike, what do you think about this? I couldn't get Blake's patch to work for me.

The customize-entered attribute will be set on #main-window as soon as the CSS transition is completed, but _not_ before we populate the palette. I wonder if this is why you're requiring the longer transition time.

Perhaps instead of using the customize-entered attribute on the #main-window, perhaps we should select based on an attribute on the #customization-palette, which gets set after the palette is populated? And removed when depopulated?

Also, what did phlsa think of this?
phlsa gave it a ui-r+.

And I'll work on a new patch that adds a new attribute…

(Re-requesting ui-review from Philip, just to make sure this still works the way he wants.  Also to give him a chance to check it out on Jared's Windows machine.  ;)

ui-r+, assuming that this fixes the issues of the animation not triggering on Windows under certain circumstances.
