The livemarks service needs to add an annotation to all the bookmarks it adds, so that it's clear they're livemarks.  The annotation should have the name livemark/bookmarkFeedURI and the value should be the feed uri it came from.

I don't see you deleting the annotation. This should be removed when the item is no longer in any livemark folders. You will have to check when you remove it to see if its in any other folders, unfortunately. You should also respond to livemark folder deletion by removing annotations for each of its children.

Can you add NS_ENSURE_TRUE(foo, NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY) for each of these? I'm trying to do this more.


You never use 'queries' so you can delete all this code: (Plus it's wrong and you never free it.)

Here, you probably want to add "if (NS_FAILED(rv)) continue;" instead of ENSURE_SUCCESS. They may have somehow gotten a folder in their livemarks folder, so you'd want to skip it.

Use nsCAutoString instead, its supposed to be faster for smallish strings.

r= with these fixed.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
