I guess that looks ok, though please file a bug on factoring out the common usage.

maybe we could slip this in for RC3... a regression for web mail attachments and such.
Its really too late for this for 1.8.1, we should definitely get it into the 1.8.1.1 patchset.

Right click, Save As works for now, we should release note this for Fx2, and get it into 2.0.0.1 as soon as the branch reopens.
