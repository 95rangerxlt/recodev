I can mostly find my way out of this by clicking around randomly, and Gijs pointed on irc that I can press Escape or press the menu or customize buttons, but it would be nice if we presented a more obvious cue on how one should leave the customize mode.

Ehsan, what do you think of the design presented at http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups-interactive/australis-interactive-mockups/windows8.html ?
I think it's much better.  The only weird thing with that is the fact that clicking the menu button (not sure what it's called) in the customize mode closes the menu palette which contains the Exit Customize button.
