It would seem that we're running out of time on this, since we'd want to be sure to get this done before string freeze.
I guess I should have cc'd pike earlier. whoops.
We'd need to know a bit more precisely on what to do.

But, so much up-front, there's nothing good about dates and times :-(
Since we print a timestamp potentially every millisecond in our UI, we want to know how to properly localize timestamps. We also need to display milliseconds on each timestamp.
I assume that timestamps excludes dates, and is just hours, minutes, seconds, millis?

Then I'd suspect that 24:60:60.1000 should be digestible globally.

In French and other locales, the decimal separator should be localizable:
24:60:60,1000 (comma instead of dot)

This is fixed in the patch attached to bug 580454.

This wouldn't make any sense to a Persian user.

Why not? Is there a universal way to do this?

Hmm, people just do not represent milliseconds that way.

Not any that I know of.  In fact, come to think of it, I don't even know how milliseconds _should_ be represented in Persian, except when writing something down.
Would it be sufficient to simply make the timestamp a localizable string with placeholders for (24-hour) hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds? The patch in bug 580454 now does that.

Are you available to write down console entries for Persian web developers on paper?
To make my intentions for commenting here clear, I'm not saying that we should not proceed with the 11:22:33.444 format.  I was hoping to start a discussion from people from other locales to see what a good solution looks like.

FWIW, I think (hope) that Persian users would be able to figure the notation out if we ship with this format.

Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean here.  But what I meant was that every time I've seen milliseconds in Persian it has been in a context like:

"This operation takes 20 seconds and 300 milliseconds."
I'm going to close this one in favor of individual bugs (such as bug 580454) that track specific l10n issues with the console. I think we've found the various strings lurking in the console.

Given how close we are to string freeze now, I don't think we need a general bug like this any more.
Make sure to have :l10n or at least me on CC on those? Thanks.
