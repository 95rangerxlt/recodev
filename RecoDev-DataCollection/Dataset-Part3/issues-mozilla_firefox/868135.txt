With Australis, we will now have quite a few history-related items in our customization palette. Bug 855803 implemented the new history widget, and thus we shouldn't have multiple history widgets within our customization palette. Having multiple will just lead to user confusion and make guiding users through our support harder.

The History item that will be removed is the one that toggles the visibility of the History sidebar. We will keep the History item that allows the user to view their bookmarks in a panel/popup as well as convenient access to bookmarking the current page.

This bug is not concerned with removing the history sidebar.

I think this is not good for toolbar customization. Of course multiple history widgets in customization palette are not elegant. However, I doubt that we need to unify it to 1 widget.

If user selects the history toolbar widget from palette, he wouldn't use the other one. So there is no multiple history widgets on his toolbar. I feel it's no problem for user, and we would not pay the many cost for its maintenance.
The other approach we can take here is to rename the History sidebar widget to "History Sidebar" or "History Sidebar Toggle". Having two widgets with the name of "History" will be confusing, but we could also just change the names of them to disambiguate.

Changing the label sounds good. I think it's easy & effective idea.

Having a widget just to toggle a sidebar seems a bit superfluous, but "History sidebar toggle" could become a History subview entry.
as a note apart, we originally added a toggle to the bookmarks button to show/hide the sidebar, UX asked to remove it, since it's a not so common operations, and sidebars are likely going to disappear in future browsers.
