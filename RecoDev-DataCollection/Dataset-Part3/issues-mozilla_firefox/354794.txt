Try the page shown in URL, and press the yellow NEXT button several times. After 4 to 5 runs, Firefox stalls because of memory overflow. The error does not occur in IE, and most likely not in earlier versions of Firefox before 1.5 (not fully sure, because Java also changed). It can be reproduced with Firefox 2.0 RC 1.

The Java program uses JavaView by Konrad Polthier, who has confirmed this to be a possible bug in Firefox. Java Sources are available on http://www.menne-biomed.de/swallow/JSwallow3d.java.



Reproducible: Always
