Bug 304497 added UI for subscribing to feeds. The Bookmarks menu now shows a "Subscribe to This Page" menu item, which is enabled when there's one feed available. On sites with multiple different feeds, this item is replaced by a "Subscribe to This Page..." menu, which lists the available feeds.

While we're here, "Manage Bookmarks..." has been renamed to "Organize Bookmarks...".

Actually it's the other way round, the menu item is labelled "Subscribe to This Page..." and the menu "Subscribe to This Page". But that's negligible.

My knee-jerk instinct is to document how the item expands to a menu when multiple feeds are available, but I think not mentioning that is the right idea.  Most sites only have one feed, and it's not difficult to figure out what happened or how to use the menu UI if it appears.  :-)
Fixed on trunk.

I also did s/subscribe with/subscribe using/ and s/Content/Feeds/ to reflect the latest UI changes. So the sentence reads:
  If you have chosen to always subscribe
  using a Live Bookmark or a feed reader in the <em>Feeds</em> panel of
  &pref.menuPath;, the preview page will be skipped.
