When it's the first time the user starts the app manager, we should help him connect his device or install the simulator. We might also want to improve the placeholder in the list of projects when its empty.

When it's the first time the user starts the app manager, we should help him connect his device or install the simulator. We might also want to improve the placeholder in the list of projects when its empty.
Maybe we should have a wizard/setup assistant.
Any more thoughts on what we want here?  Something that takes up the main panel with buttons pointing to the Simulator and ADB?

Though it looks like you might have something for the simulator already in bug 912892.
I have a WIP patch. Basically, it's a wizard that helps the user to setup his device or install the simulator.
My initial thought was to build an assistant. Because we won't have time to do so, we will implement a basic first run screen.

For the assistant, see bug 916074.

I'd break the help.links out into an entry for each <li>, and I'd remove the mdn and amo link attributes. I think you can get away with just

<!ENTITY help.amo "Addon: <a>Firefox OS Simulator</a>">

and then use js to add the href and target attributes. Tools have issues with html attributes, sadly. You should link to https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/, like you do on mdn.

Also, it's "Add-on".

16:18 < robcee> I would change "install web apps to compatible devices" to "install web apps on compatible devices".
16:18 < robcee> and maybe the last sentence to "Use the bottom toolbar to connect a device or start the simulator"
And Darrin says:

16:19 < darrin> should "like Firefox OS" be either "i.e. Firefox OS" or "i.e. FirefoxOS devices?"
And Darrin adds:

16:20 < darrin> and last sentence should be 'connect TO a device'... no?
After hearing robcee's reasoning, i think 'like Firefox OS' is fine. No need for 'e.g.'.
Thanks Pike.

I'd second Pike's suggestion from comment 8 to break this string in 3 pieces: "Useful links:", and then one string for each list item. Also remove "en-US" from AMO's link.

What about setting the pref to false only when we select a tab and `firstRun` is true?
So that we keep it displayed until the user actually do something.

I do not have simulator builds yet, it's a bit more complex than adb as we need to build one xpi per platform and we need to host them on AMO to handle that easily.
But this link is misleading. What do you think about adding an entry on "Using the app manager" page that will say, today, that we do not have the addon ready yet and we would update this entry as soon as we manage to host it.

We don't need to have a valid page right now. We can always update this wiki page later. But what I need to be sure of though is the URL. Are you ok with it?

The links should be just hard-coded in the js, there's no point to expose them to l10n.

I'm wondering if the whole line of text really should be a link each. I would have expected to see fragments of text still?

These links should just be hard-coded, there's no point to expose them to l10n. They're functionality, not UI.

The page you choosed for the simulator will require significant amount of work before being updated correctly:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Installing_the_Simulator
As it mainly explains the dashboard, most of its content should move to a archive for the old simulator addon. So yes, it should end up being the right place to redirect, but in the meantime, it would be easier to refer to a short entry in the "Using the app manager" page.

We did that in a previous patch. I think it feels better to have the whole line as a link.
(we also need to update the "install simulator" link in the connection screen)

Can someone please explain why are we doing this? Unless absolutely needed, you should never expose the <a> tags to localizers. You are risking breaking the UI.

Meh. Sorry, that was totally stupid. Code changed a lot and ended up like that. My fault. I'll fix that asap.
See bug 916597.
Thank you, Paul. That's much better now.
