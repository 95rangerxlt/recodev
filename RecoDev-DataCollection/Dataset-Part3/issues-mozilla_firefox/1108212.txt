Steps to reproduce:

STR:
1. Go to this page: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/779e64334c1d/browser/devtools/inspector/test/browser_inspector_menu.js
2. Open the DevTools Inspector
3. Select #l1.21
4. Press delete


Actual results:

The previous node sibling is selected.


Expected results:

When the user presses delete, the inspector should
1. select the next sibling
2. If the latter doesn't exist, select the previous sibling
3. If there is no sibling anymore, select the parent node

For backspace, that would behave the same except that 1. and 2. would be inverted.

Drive by comments: we will need test changes in browser_markupview_tag_edit_04.js to cover the new cases here.

Please update the header comment to explain the params, and which element will be focused after the delete happens

:bgrings updated, thanks!

BTW, should the logic of the selection (after a node has been deleted) be updated too?
When you see |browser/devtools/inspector/test/browser_inspector_delete-selected-node-02.js|, the manual deletion selects the next element. But the automatic deletion (done through a javascript) selects the parent node.
If so, maybe we should fill another bug?

Looks good, thanks.  There is a bit of a jump in the inspector when pressing delete to move forward where the newly selected node becomes selected before it moves down in the tree, so it sort of jumps down immediately after becoming selected.  This must be due to the call to navigate() happening before the markup mutation comes through to the frontend.  There are probably ways around it, but I'm not sure if it's worth adding any complexity to this function.
