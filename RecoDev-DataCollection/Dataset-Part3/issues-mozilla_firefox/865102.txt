Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

Lowered the screen resolution to make the desktop and browser more readable on the tablet.


Actual results:

Firefox tab icons stay the same size, no matter what the screen resolution is. How is that even possible? The tabs get larger, but the icons stay the original size.


Expected results:

The tab icons should get larger along with the rest of the browser as the video resolution gets lower. Somehow they are kept the same small size that they were at the higher resolution. The mouse cursor gets larger, but not the Firefox tab icons. Only happens on the Surface Pro, not on a desktop computer.

Could you test Nightly (Firefox 23) to confirm the issue is still present (some features have been added about OS resolution settings).
See http://nightly.mozilla.org/
This issue appears to be fixed in the nightly build version. The tab icons are now the correct size for the screen resolution. Also the pages are easier to read without zooming.
So this was fixed by bug 844604, it seems.
