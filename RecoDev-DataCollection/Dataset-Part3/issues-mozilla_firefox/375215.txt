Add missing null check

Google's code search uses type "text/html" for the content. Firefox expects it to be "html" and fails displaying it with an exception (both Firefox 2.0.0.3 and trunk nightlies):

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIDOMHTMLParagraphElement.appendChild]"  nsresult: "0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///.../components/FeedWriter.js :: FW__writeFeedContent :: line 273"  data: no]
Source File: file:///.../components/FeedWriter.js
Line: 273

The problem is this code:

  docFragment = summary.createDocumentFragment(body);
  body.appendChild(docFragment);

summary.createDocumentFragment() will return null for unknown types. So adding a null check for body.append() fixes the exception - entries are still displayed, just without a summary.

There remains the question whether we should recognize MIME types in the type attribute. From the spec it looks that we should:

   On the atom:content element, the value of the "type" attribute MAY be
   one of "text", "html", or "xhtml".  Failing that, it MUST conform to
   the syntax of a MIME media type, but MUST NOT be a composite type
   (see Section 4.2.6 of [MIMEREG]).

We /could/, but we don't have to. (I edited that spec).

Recognize MIME types in Atom

I will reformulate the question: if we *could* do this, why don't we?

Recognize MIME types in Atom

Atom's escaped-html encoding rules don't apply to "text/html". 

http://feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/HtmlFragment.html

The correct interpretation of "text/html" would not be identical to "html", if we were to implement it.
Robert, does the first patch need sr? If so, could you please pick somebody?
