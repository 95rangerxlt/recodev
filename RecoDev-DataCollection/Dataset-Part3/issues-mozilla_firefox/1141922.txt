Which app list are you referring to?  I'm not sure I see what you're seeing.
If you are in the need info, you click on the drop down menu in the left corner where you would select an app to debug or run. There should be one that says main processes.
Okay I found the solution to the problem... you need a firefox browser of at least 39 to work with the 3.0 master... I would recommend adding a warning to the section about updating your flame on the mozilla flame page though to let people know... I am not sure what to mark this as... can some one with a better knowledge mark this properly.
I think that's why the v3 version isn't listed in the install.  Not sure.  Anyhow, I'll NI ux in regards to a warning or something.
Sorry, I don't understand the UX request. Would this be for a warning on device?
Im not sure where the warning would be... I know that the 3.0 is currently not listed on the updating your flame page so you cant really put the warning there... maybe in webIDE or something... all I know is im pretty sure sure im not gonna be the only one who runs into this problem...
A suggestion has been made by jryans to have a warning or something when connecting in webIDE.
Noting for later release, removing flag to myself.
This is happening again... But this time when selecting Main Precess it pulls up the page but it is just saying Main Process on the info screen, the rest is blank, and i cant access debugging app.
This is related to a change made in bug 1147042.  It requires versions of Firefox and device / simulator to all have the change made in that bug.  The hope was that people on these edge versions typically update regularly, so there would not be too much issue.

However, the simulator needed has not been officially released yet (see bug 1150577).
This should now be resolved once the simulator update is applied.
