For the initial landing, we'll want to place enhanced tiles at the right spot relative to the user's own browsing history.

dcrobot, Boriss provided some initial thoughts in bug 988447.

Some possible options of aggregating/deduping:

- find the score of the highest ranked history tile and insert enhanced tile before that history tile (if it's an exact match, the history tile gets replaced; if it's not an exact match, there'll be both an enhanced tile and a history tile)
- replace the first history tile with the enhanced tile while keeping other history
- only show one tile (history or enhanced) for a given site (eTLD+1)
\- either take the normal scoring and only show the highest ranked
\- or add up scores of multiple tiles to potentially bump it up to position 1

clarkbw, is this something you should decide while dcrobot thinks of a way to integrate longer term?

Ed, of the options listed, the one I had in mind was this:

"replace the first history tile with the enhanced tile while keeping other
history"

However, I will defer to Borris and / or the team if you guys decide otherwise. Just as long as there is never more than 1 single tile for any given content domain.

Would that tile point to the original history url or the one provided by the enhanced tile?

If the first history tile of the site is a sub page/domain, the user would be losing out on that original functionality. That's why I suggested the "find score and insert before then dedupe if exact" although it's not that trivial for an exact match as we have partner codes in the links. E.g., if I have smile.amazon.com high in my history and we want to show www.amazon.com/?partner=firefox enhanced, I would want to still be able to get to my original link.

But even if my top history was amazon.com, the actual enhanced link is actually http://www.amazon.com/gp/bit/amazonbookmark.html so matching all possible patterns could be difficult. Similarly do we replace someone's www.wikipedia.org history with en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page enhanced?

We need a short term answer, even if the longer term answer is different.
Ed, all tiles should take the user to the last page visited - for now.

Once we add further enhancements, then we can offer both the directory listing, and the "advertised" one.

Take the proposed WIRED tile, for example. Clicking the tile launches a YouTube video player with a big button along the bottom. The user will be able view more suggested content within the content of WIRED's YouTube page, OR they can always click the button below to go to the last page they visited on WIRED.com.

Furthermore, once we allow for tile customization, users will be able to specify whether they want a particular tile to be a directory link, or feature new content (like latest headlines).

Does this make sense?

That should be fine for now. It might just be a corner case where someone happens to have a specific page on a site, say the fashion section on nytimes, and we would replace the history thumbnail with an article, e.g., the "cybercriminals zero in on.." in the mockup, and the user clicking it would still end up on the fashion section.

Related, this might be something we just have partners keep in mind to not be too specific in the enhanced tile image right now where there would be an expectation to go directly to that content. So instead, partners would use the enhanced image as a way to draw the user back to somewhere on the site (and for most users I would guess, the history link would be the home page).

Just to clarify, the url that gets loaded is whatever would have been shown in that history tile (so not necessarily the *last page visited* but more likely the most frecently visited page from that site).

Does this mean we should keep the original title as well if we're keeping the original url and only changing the thumbnail to the unhovered/hovered enhanced image?

For example, if a user's top history tile to bmwblog.com would have been:
- title: BMW Cars Test Drives and Reviews
- url: http://www.bmwblog.com/category/test-drives/
- image: page thumbnail

We would keep the title and url and swap the unhovered image to be that one with the lens flare + bmw and add a hovered image of the BB logo?
clarkbw, one behavior that's still undefined is if there's 2+ enhanced content from the same site, e.g., mozilla.org/lightbeam vs mozilla.org/, where the behavior dcrobot described was to replace the first history tile from that site.

One simple way to sidestep this for now is to have at most 1 enhanced content for a site.

(Where I've been thinking site = eTLD+1, so smile.amazon.com == www.amazon.com == amazon.com)
Ed + Bryan, I personally never envisioned 2 tiles from the same content source. However, I could see multiple tiles for multiple services... Think Gmail + Drive (but never ever just "Google" x 2).

That seems like a reasonable approach for now.  Eventually we'll want to handle the espn.com/nhl versus espn.com/nba because they would likely be very different tiles.

Yeah, I would consider it a bug if we had google.com more than once unless it was with a different path like google.com/images and google.com/calendar/
Ed, is this an actual implementation/fix or just a decision-making bug? I'm interested in what can be done here in terms of QA.
This was a ux/pm decision bug. Thanks.
clarkbw, comment 6 had a comment: "We would keep the title and url and swap the unhovered image to be that one with the lens flare + bmw and add a hovered image of the BB logo?"

Is that how we're enhancing history? So the only thing changes is the image shown when unhovered and hovered?

Image changes are the major piece.  I don't think changes to the title had been discussed.  

I recall we had talked about improving the displayed title, which can often be a URL instead of a page title.
