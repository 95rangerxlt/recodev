Now that we have builds from MOZILLA_1_8_0_BRANCH and MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH it is important to be able to distinguish them. 

Please update the versions for MOZILLA_1_8_0_BRANCH builds to rv: 1.8.0.1 and Firefox/1.5.0.1

Stab

Chase is back in the office, but wasn't feeling well today.

I took a stab at this; I'll check it in for tomorrow's builds if someone can review it (don't know how to r? from...)
Err... don't know WHO to r? from...

r=chase, assuming we need to bump the Gecko milestone at all.  Asking for additional review from bsmedberg.

Landing this should happen along with build infrastructure version changes for patch packaging.

Yes, we definitely need to bump the gecko version (UA string, xulrunner version, etc).
