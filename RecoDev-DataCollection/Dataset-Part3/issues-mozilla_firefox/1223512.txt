When doing this checking, we can take the opportunity to change edge referents from node ids to pointers since the nodes hash set is frozen after being read.

This looks fine to me -- it is validating the integrity of the loaded heap graph, that all edges are known, otherwise the snapshot is corrupt. Correct?

> [Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

Will lead to null pointer dereferencing / undefined behavior / crashes when reading corrupted heap snapshots rather than simply rejecting them.
ni myself to remember to request uplift after this sits in m-c for a day or so.
