When you open View Cookies, sites are placed randomly (or in the order in
cookies.txt probably) now. Cookies should be sorted by 'Site' on load.

Still not working on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2)
Gecko/20050520 Firefox/1.0+
Cookies are now grouped by site in the new Cookie Viewer. But the sites are not
sorted alphabetically by default, as they should.

The call to sort them is commented out:

The problem I've seen when testing the sort is that performance gets REAL bad
when you go to the bottom of the list and start clicking up, and obviously the
same concept applies to other areas. I'll see if any optimization could be done
on it.

This was uncommented in bug 285002's checkin, which should also have fixed some
of the slowness. Can anybody verify?

That seems to be the only thing left for this bug. I have tested by putting sort
in there, but it's not consistent with its results (i.e. you can delete a cookie
from a site, visit that site and the entry for that site appears twice), plus it
gives the rendering of pages a hit if a cookie's being added on that page.

I say we don't implement sorting in this case. mconnor, your take on this?
Also, there is still a problem. When clearing a filter, the list becomes unsorted.
please file a followup on the other issues.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
