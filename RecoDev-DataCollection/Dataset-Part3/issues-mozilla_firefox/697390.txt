STR:

1) Have at least two groups with at least one tab per group
2) Restart Firefox
3) Open a new tab
4) Use switch-to-tab to jump to another group's tab

Actual result:

The tab from (3) was moved to the group we just switched to.

Expected result:

The new tab should of course not move around.

It turned out that it's caused by other patch.

The leak does't happen in this push.
