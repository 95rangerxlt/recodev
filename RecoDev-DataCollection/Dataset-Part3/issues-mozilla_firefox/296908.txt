Try to reproduce this with a nightly build: http://www.mozilla.org/developer
Tried with the nightly build and it was OK, but then tried with FF1.0.4 and it
was OK again; so don't know whether it was a problem with their site, an OS
error which required a restart or a glitch somewhere else which the nightly
build ironed out for FF. Will flag again and investigate further if it comes up
again.
