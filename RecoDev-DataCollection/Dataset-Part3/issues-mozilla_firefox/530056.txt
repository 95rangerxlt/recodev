Should probably be checking nsICrashReporter.enabled before calling annotate. The sessionstore code had a bunch of checks for this (crashreporter not compiled in/not enabled), I guess they didn't make it to the new code.
So this is why I keep getting this in home-made builds....

Safe fix to prevent error console spam. Should take next time.
