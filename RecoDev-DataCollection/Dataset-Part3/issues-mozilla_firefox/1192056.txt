I'm seeing all mixed content states are visible on any page in control center - see the screenshot.  This is in a local fx-team build with these commits applied:

Wow, sorry. Not sure what happened here but you're right. They're definitely there in my local copy and the patches git is exporting. Maybe hg threw them away somehow?
Fixed by backing out bug 1175702.
Oh :( Just found this in my console:

patching file browser/themes/shared/controlcenter/panel.inc.css
Hunk #1 FAILED at 0
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file browser/themes/shared/controlcenter/panel.inc.css.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)

Shouldn't push stuff that late in the evening, sorry again.
