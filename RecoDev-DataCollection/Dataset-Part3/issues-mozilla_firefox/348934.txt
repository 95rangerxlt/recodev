On Linux, partial tabs cut off by the two scroll buttons look different.  On the left button, a partial tab is drawn with a few blank pixels between it and the scroll button, which looks odd.  On the right this space is reduced, which looks less odd, though still not perfectly clean.

Right scroll button with partial tab (not hideous)

Left scroll button with partial tab (hideous)
This is polish, we should fix it for final, although I think "hideous" is overstating things a little; we're just leaving too much space on one side.
in bug #349286, my patch does the reverse, which is to add padding to the right scroll button (which pkcasting calls "not hideous").

I was going for symmetry, but my preference was to fix the other button.

but it beltzner and mconnor agree that we want 0px border between the button and the tab (instead of 2px), I'll go fix it.

the fix will be in bug #349286
thinking about it for a second, pkasting is right, not having the 2px separation is better.

fix coming soon to a browser near you!
