Patch v1
Brian, I think you'll want to patch the upstream pdf.js repo and submit a pull request there:

https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/babd8df1769a82b1b65a9e394a68cf695ed179dd/extensions/firefox/components/PdfStreamConverter.js#L347
Pull request opened at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2413
Was just about to do that, thanks saved me some time :)
Can we still push this to m-c or will we be doing another update to a newer version of pdfjs soon?
We need to update the version on m-c, yes. I'll file the bug for that once this is fixed upstream.
I think the pull request is already accepted to pdfjs
