--disbable-places dies with JS errors on startup because browser.js wants things that are defined only when Places is enabled (Cc as an alias for Components.classes, and Ci for Components.interfaces)

Patch coming to also define them in bookmarks.js :)

I'm running with a build with this in it, seems to work.

Just put this at the top of browser.js, ifndef MOZ_PLACES.

Try 2, in browser.js

Take 2, this time in a #ifndef MOZ_PLACES block in browser.js as requested.  Still seems to work :)

(heh, nsCI already exists in that file... Not going to touch it though.  I'm treating this as a temporary workaround until --disable-places gets killed completely)

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
