Steps to reproduce:

http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/default.aspx?centerx=30&centery=25&zoom=2&level1=140

Should track shipping movements -English Channel for instance should show, say, 100+ ships.


Actual results:

A small handful of markers are shown with peculiar details - even when all extensions are disabled


Expected results:

Site should show a multitude of contacts and be updated every 90 seconds. Works ok in FF10.

Have spent time tweaking my plugins. Reloading Shockwave for Director seems, rpt seems to have solved the problem
Bah! Take back comment 3. It is, for me, an intermittent problem. Will keep searching.

Thanks for the report, Peter! I just came across this bug and am closing it now, after a quick test to make sure it's still working. By the way, I love the marinetraffic site too and often check it to look at San Francisco Bay shipping! :)
