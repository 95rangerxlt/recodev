This problem started like 3 days ago...i've been using FireFox 3.0.1 for about two weeks in this new laptop...

Now When i sign in on eBay, Yahoo, Gmail,etc and i select to keep me sign for X days, and i close FireFox and open it within 1-3 min and go back to those websites I have to re-sign in everytime, I tried IE (i hate to admit it) and works fine, it keep my cookies fine, i dont have to sign in again... Now i re-install FireFox 2.0 (previous) and it works fine, FireFox 2.0 remembers where i was...
So i'm pretty sure that firefox 3.0.1 has nested a bug... but i might be wrong 
Help Please, i really wanna stay with FireFox 3.0.1 because in this one i have a lot bookmarks that firefox 2.0 can not recognize.
Thank You

Did you tested this in the Firefox safemode ?
Do you have for example Firebug installed ?
