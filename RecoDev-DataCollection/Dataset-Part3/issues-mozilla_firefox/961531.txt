There is an inline event handler on the requests-menu-reload-notice-button element.  This should be moved into shadereditor.js.  Victor, please correct me if you think it should be elsewhere, but I'm thinking it should be added and removed in EventsHandler.initialize and EventsHandler.destroy.

Thank you Brian. Can you please assign me in?

Sure :).  And if you haven't seen it already, take a look at our guide for getting DevTools built and running: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking.  You may also need to enable the shader editor panel in the DevTools options pane if you don't see it as an available tab.

This is not valid JavaScript.  I'd suggest you open the Shader Editor with the patch applied to test out the changes.

Secondly, rather than putting this in a new DOMContentLoaded handler, the button should have an addEventListener call in the EventsHandler.initialize function, and a removeEventListener call in the EventsHandler.destroy function.

You can use $("#requests-menu-reload-notice-button") as a helper function to get ahold of the button element in both places.
Sorry for the delay. I'm working on this.
Malintha - Are you still working on this?
Mike - Sorry, I got engaged in one of the GSoC projects. So may not be able to look in to this for some time. You can take this if you like. :)
Based on comment 7 unassigned the bug.
Hi, I'm interested in to fix this issue. May you assign me to this bug?

Looks great, thanks Ali!  I've included a couple of minor notes, but this looks ready to go after those are updated.  Also, in the commit message, can you replace 'event handle' with 'event handler'?  You can re-upload a patch and flag me for review again after that.

Please re-add the new line between these two functions
