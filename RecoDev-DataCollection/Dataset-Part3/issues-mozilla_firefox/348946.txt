After the landing of bug 348431, there is now a large white box next to your location bar when customizing toolbars.  This looks broken.  Screenshot coming soon.

Strange-looking white box is circled
At a guess this is the hidden drop down marker showing up differently in linux. I'll try to take a look at it this evening.

This isn't really related to the new theme.

patch rev 1

This patch changes to using display:none to hide the drop down. I have tested this under Linux and Windows and in both cases it gets rid of the remaining gap where the drop down was.
Please note that bug 347616 and this bug affect may each other.  Especially if we draw a non-native dropdown, we may want to just make it inactive rather than hiding it.

Can the dropdown just be disabled during customize mode instead of hidden?
