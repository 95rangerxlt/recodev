Patch (v1)

I think this failure is very similar to bug 500702.  I took a similar approach in fixing it.

The delayedStartup replacement code is pretty straightforward.  The updateTitlebar replacement code used a timer, because in one case (about:privatebrowsing loaded outside of the PB mode), the page's onload handler changes the title, so updateTitlebar would be called twice for that page.

the patch needs unbitrotting

btw, i did unbitrot it, but running it locally caused a fail:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochikit/content/browser/../browser/browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_windowtitle.js | The window title for about:privatebrowsing is correct (outside private browsing mode) - Got Private Browsing - Minefield, expected Would you like to start Private Browsing? - Minefield

since i can't be completely sure i have unbitrotted correctly (but that looked quite trivial) could you provide an updated patch? i can eventually test it.

patch v1.1

on the other side, giving some breath to the main thread, and increasing timeout to 300ms (especially this), solves the issue for me.

Being dependant on a timeout this could still be fragile though.
notice it was working even with a 200ms timeout, but i set 300ms because i'm a pessimist.

Does the same patch with a 200ms timeout fail?

You should use the DOMTitleChanged event instead.

Couldn't you just flag that case and ignore the first DOMTitleChanged event?
Or just always wait for for the load event.

can we please approve this patch for branches?

1.9.1 patch

So, on 1.9.1, we would need the fix to bug 506437 for this patch.  That fix got approval-minused because it was merely a polish bug, but now it's needed for this orange fix.  I would think that it's safe to take this patch.
