Things like bug 1062876 or bug 1114433 could have been caught earlier if we had had appropriate testing for getUserMedia used in a frame.

Tests

This is based on the browser_devices_get_user_media.js test. I also added in that file a test that the WebRTC sharing UI is correctly removed when the page is reloaded.

Then, the new test for frames is a fork of the existing test, running the relevant tests in an iframe, and adding tests for a few frame-specific cases.
