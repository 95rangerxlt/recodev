Since I've updated Nightly, I can't drag the browser around by window title bar. I am also using it on an external monitor if that helps.

I can confirm this. This is not dependent on an external monitor: It happens on both my iMac and MBP without external screens.
Seems to be fixed w/ the latest build.
