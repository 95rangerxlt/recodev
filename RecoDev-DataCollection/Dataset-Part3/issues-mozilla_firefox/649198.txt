Default to the aurora branding in the aurora repo (mozilla-aurora only)
Is the intention that we'll land this on Aurora every time we pull from m-c? catlee was talking about this yesterday and was wondering if we could do this without that manual step. I suppose the tradeoff is between "land a patch on every m-c->m-a pull" and "have something in aurora mozconfigs to switch branding".
No, we'll likely use configs. Gavan and I discussed that this was the best way for this merge.

I assume we could use --with-branding=/browser/branding/aurora  in the mozconfig
Yes, but I prefer the confvar.sh change, since it associates the branding change with the repository, rather than only our build slaves.
Hrm, that's going to require manual intervention at each m-c->aurora merge, no? I really think this ought to be a property of the build config, not the code itself. But I guess we'll see how much pain this causes.
Yes. I'm hoping it's not a lot of pain (particularly compared to the other merging work that will be necessary).
We can set it in the mozconfig that's used for mozilla-aurora.
