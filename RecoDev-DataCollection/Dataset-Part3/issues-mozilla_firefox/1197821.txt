Steps to reproduce:

i subscribe some Feed, for example
http://www.ghacks.net/feed/
and move the Feed from my Bookmark Toolbar in another Folder.


Actual results:

the Feed remains in the Bookmark Toolbar and the last Bookmark in the Toolbar will be deleted.



Expected results:

The Live Bookmark should move in the Folder i've selected without deleting another Bookmark in the Folder.
it works fine in Firefox 39 and happens only in version 40
try with safe mode and a clean Profile.

There are 2 issues:
1) the new feed is not moved in the selected place (folder or menu) and stays in the Bookmarks Toolbar
2) the previous folder or bookmark added to the Bookmarks Toolbar is moved to the placed selected for the new feed

So there is a swap in the order of the elements.

STR:
1) Display the Bookmarks Toolbar
2) Create a New Folder (or Bookmark) in the Bookmarks Toolbar
3) Open http://www.ghacks.net/feed/
4) When subscribing the feed, select the Bookmarks Menu in the field "Folder"

Result:
The feed is saved in the Bookmarks Toolbar instead of the Bookmarks Menu.
The New Folder is moved from the Bookmarks Toolbar to the Bookmarks Menu.
1st regression: new feed not saved in the selected folder.

Tracking for 41+. Too late to fix this in 40. We could likely still take a patch for beta 41.
mak or gijs, are you interested in a bookmarks regression? :)
I think Marco is more likely to fulfill all 3 criteria of: interested, capable, and having time (particularly because I am on PTO next week).
I wonder if this is due to promiseItemId/Guid in a batch, markh has a patch for that in bug 1190131 and it would be nice to know if that will help...

btw, considered it's RSS, this has a lower priority than other more critical stuff, sorry but for now I can't take this.
We are about a week away from building 41 RC and given that RSS feed gets saved to bookmark toolbar and not the intended folder, but gets saved nevertheless, I would not deem this to be a 41 release blocker. Updating status-firefox41 to wontfix.
Loic, this seems to WFM on fx41 beta9 on OSX - can you confirm this was fixed by bug 1190131?
Yes, it's fixed in FF41+.

Working range:
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/pushloghtml?fromchange=c6f1cb17384630670f190d24d21cdc7b357eb840&tochange=6f5c75b6c25507eacde18f73ba4698f5ffb6f45a

But bug 1190131 is not in this range, but probably more one of these bugfixes:

Marco Bonardo — Bug 1194568 - Renaming live bookmark while adding it renames the wrong one. r=ttaubert
Marco Bonardo — Bug 1199496 - New bookmarks dialog width is increased at each invocation. r=ttaubert
Marco Bonardo — Bug 1193621 - Can't change tag name in library. r=ttaubert
yep, fixed by bug 1194568.
