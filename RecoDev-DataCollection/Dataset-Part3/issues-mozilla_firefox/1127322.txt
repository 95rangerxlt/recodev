Note: sites === "allocations", timestamps === "allocationTimestamps" from the data returned by `getAllocations`.

Maybe mention MemoryActor.prototype.getAllocations? That has a lot of context about what is what in these type of objects that is lost here.

Also, this param is wrongly named and isn't actually an array either. I assume this is a hold over from an old version of code or something, but we should fix it :)

You can use `deepEqual(output, EXPECTED_OUTPUT)` now that we have the common js assert module in tests: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mochitest#Test_functions
