Hmm, is this a regression from bug 647216?
Mike, would this be an unintended consequences from private browsing's use of in-titlebar drawing for private browsing windows?
Ouch, possibly. Hang on - lemme poke at this.
STR:

1) Go to http://www.getpersonas.com and add a lightweight theme to Firefox
2) Open a Private Browsing window

Result:

According to DOMi, we're getting burned by this rule: http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mozilla/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser.css#42

I don't believe we need this rule in this new drawing-titlebar-in-OSX world we're living in now. Give me some time to confirm.

Hm, so we *do* need this rule until we're permanently drawing in the titlebar a-la bug 625989.
Ugh, and I was wrong about needing to have a lw-theme installed. Was using the wrong build.

The STR in comment 4 are no longer valid. Just opening a private browsing window is sufficient to expose the bug.

Don't display:none the titlebar if we're in a private browsing window.

I believe you want '#main-window:not([drawintitlebar=true]) > #titlebar' here.

> #main-window[drawintitlebar="true"] > #titlebar {
>   height: 22px;

And then you can change this to just #titlebar.

Oh yes - good thinking. That's much more direct.

I think here is still an issue:

Switching into (and out of) fullscreen with a PrivateMode Window with the shortcut SHIFT-CMD-F or CTRL-CMD-F is very smooth.

But when you use the Fullscreen-Button then you will notice a short break with the titlebar and you will notice that there is not a nice transition while switching into (and out of) fullscreen.

Same behavior, when you are in fullscreen with a PrivateMode Window and open a new one with SHIFT-CMD-P.

Is this a known issue or should I file a new one ?

Thanks.
Please file a new one.
