r=mano with a comment either here or inlined in tree.xml on the ip check.

I was thinking of separating this into a new type (TYPE_X_MOZ_PLACES_BOOKMARK?) when we get back to d&d code cleanup.

I added a comment in tree.xml.

Sounds like a good idea, better to be explicit about the transfer types.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
