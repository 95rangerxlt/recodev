I recently updated my Quicktime software. Since then, when I select Real Player
as my preferred audio player, I get the window with "open with Quicktime Player
(default)" and no other options, then I get the "unsupported transport" in the
Quicktime player. This has happened at the http://www.npr.org and at other sites
offering Real Player. The problem does not arise in Safari or Explorer. NPR sent
me the following solution, but it did not work:

"For Macintosh OS X:
In the Finder, locate the folder where your Web browser downloads its files.
This defaults to the desktop folder. In the list of files, find one that ends
with ".smil," for example: "npr1337.smil." Right-click (or control-click) on the
".smil" file in the Finder, and select "Get Info." In the window that pops up,
click the triangle to the left of the "Open With:" text, so that it points
downward. (If it is already pointing downward, there is no need to click it.)
Click on the drop-down box that says "Adobe GoLive CS (default)" or "QuickTime
Player", and select "RealPlayer." Click "Change All." Restart your Mac."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on any "Listen" button
2. Select "Real Player" as the preferred audio player
Actual Results:  
A dialog box appears asking me what Firefox should do with this file. In the
open with option it says "Quicktime (default)" with no other options.

Expected Results:  
In the "open with" list it should give me the Real Player option, then launch in
Real Player

Maybe related to bug 198809?
This is a major OS X helper application issue, where when one helper is already
defined for the file type, Firefox does not let you manually pick a different
one. Only choices are the default (despite the presence of a full pulldown menu)
and save to disk.

I suspect this is a dupe, will do some bugzilla sleuthing...
Surprisingly, I can't find a dupe. However, as mentioned in bug 267484, in older
OS X builds:
  Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913
Firefox/0.10.1

...there used to be an "Other" in the "Open With..." pulldown menu. So this must
be a relatively recent regression. (marking +reg)

This snafu is present on the 1.8/FF1.5 branch:
  Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b5)
Gecko/20051006 Firefox/1.4.1

...so I'm requesting blocking to have someone look at it. IMHO, it's a pretty
poor UI issue. There is NO way to change this SOLE action Firefox presents for
these SMIL files. Not in the download helper dialog, and not in
Preferences->Download Actions. (It seems to be picking up the SMIL->QT default
helper via system preferences, not from the helpers or plugins).

Can someone confirm the open with "Other" option is still available on other
platforms? I suspect this is OS X pp.
WORKAROUND, at least for SMIL files. The deeper Firefox UI problem remains.

Marilynn reported that NPR suggested changing the SMIL association through OS X
(Get Info). This change doesn't seem to be picked up by Firefox, nor is
disassociating SMIL in Quicktime Preferences, though this may be a prerequisite.
Here is what worked for me:

1) Start RealPlayer, and from the application menu ("RealPlayer", top-left next
to the Apple) select "Preferences...".

2) From the icons at the top of the window, select "Media Types".

3) You should see a list of four or so types, with check boxes next to them all.
On mine, SMIL was already checked. I unchecked it, which enabled the "Save Media
Types" button. Click it, and RealPlayer will say that it needs to restart your
web browser (Firefox). Respond to this dialog with "Configure". Now that you've
unselected SMIL, re-select it, and click "Save Media Types" once again.

4) Now start up Firefox, and sites serving SMIL files to you should give you the
RealPlayer as the only choice now, instead of Quicktime.

If that doesn't work, and Quicktime is still listed, you may need to first go
into OS X System Preferences -> Quicktime -> Advanced -> MIME Settings, expand
Miscellaneous at the bottom, and uncheck SMIL.

I wonder if this is only a problem for OS X users that either are still on 10.3
or that upgraded from it to 10.4. However, that's still the majority of OS X
users out there that are affected. I bet if you install RealPlater *AFTER* the
Quicktime upgrade that came out along side OS X 10.4, the SMIL file type
wouldn't be thieved by Apple's less-capable implementation. (Remember their
lovely PNG co-opting years ago?)
This happens to me with PDFs.  It only gives me the option of using Preview, even though I have Adobe Reader installed.  This is on a 12" Powerbook factory installed with Tiger, so I don't believe this is a 10.3 -> 10.4 upgrade issue.

Can the reporter please rewrite the summary to be more general?  Something like: Firefox on Mac OS X only gives one application option for "Open with" when opening links requiring an external application

Are we sure this is a regression?
