this should be SessionFileInternal._latestWrite, rather than SessionFile._latestWrite.

Great find, we should make sure to get this into Fx 28+29. Actually, it would need to go into Fx 27 as well, which isn't going to happen...

It is indeed to late for 27 (currently the beta branch) but no worries for aurora.

Any way to test this?

David, does this have steps to reproduce that QA can use to verify this is fixed?

I can't think of anything reliable, I'm afraid.

Okay, thank you.
What are the practical effects of this bug?
The effect is that we might not wait for the SessionWorker to finish writing on shutdown. Which in turn might lead to data loss if there's data that hasn't made it to disk yet.
In the worst case, we might end up with:
- a session store representing the browsing state as it was ~15 seconds ago;
- some intriguing console warnings.
