New bookmark, New folder, New separator and Move... commands in Organize should be disabled if the current view doesn't support them.

This is quite confusing, I found this bug while reading feedback on the new manager.

When verifying this bug I found a situation where the common Organize options are still enabled if the Downloads view is in focus.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox and perform several downloads.
2. Open the Downloads View using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd+ J on Windows and Mac OS X or Ctrl+Shift+Y on Ubuntu)
3. Click on the Bookmarks Toolbar and after that, in the right side click on any of the bookmarks
4. Move the focus from the Library window
5. Focus the Downloads View again by using the keyboard shortcut
6. Click on the Organize button to see the options.

Expected results:
New bookmark, New folder, New separator and Move options are disabled.

Actual results:
New bookmark, New folder, New separator and Move options are enabled.

Marco, would you prefer me to file a new bug or to reopen this one?

please file a new blocker bug, it's likely we missed updating commands somewhere.
Thanks Marco, filed Bug 836211.
Verified as fixed on Firefox 20 RC - the common Organize options are disabled when the Downloads view is in focus.
