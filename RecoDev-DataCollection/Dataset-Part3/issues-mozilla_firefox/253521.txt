I removed the "all" here, since there is no effect at all until you restart
Firefox. For example, mouse gestures still work after uninstalling All-in-One
Gestures.

diff -uw of that

Without the whitespace changes.
When I wrote the Language Style guide, I didn't mention sentence spacing.  I
considered it, but I didn't think it would matter much.  Perhaps it matters a
little more than I thought.

Sentence spacing has to be the most nitpicky change I could have proposed.  The
end user never sees it.  Both types of spacing are common.  Maintaining a
specific choice here requires a certain amount of effort.  Is the return worth
the effort?  Out of habit I always used two, so my changes in the docs I've
touched (which is probably most) are double-spaced between sentences.  I've also
seen some that were single-spaced (so my changes were double but the original
stayed single).

For this patch it doesn't matter because the work's already been done.  In the
future, tho, is it really a worthwhile goal to standardize sentence spacing? 
It's nothing the end user will ever see, and I get the feeling it'll just create
more nitpicky work for any would-be patcher or reviewer.
As an FYI, R.J., there are some minor changes for bug 253538 that might be worth
adding to this patch.  The change would correct a grammatical error.  I've
outlined the necessary change in that bug, and I don't think it'll impact any
l10n efforts.
R.J. said on IRC that we shouldn't use ">", because someone who needs Help might
not understand that. So instead of this:
  Select <span class="menuPath">Tools &gt; Options</span>.
we should use this:
  Select <span class="menuPath">Options</span> from the <span
  class="menuPath">Tools</span> menu.
A grep for "&gt;" in browser/components/help/locales/en-US yields 26 hits (after
I deleted my ~-files).

But then someone said that
"In Help code the standard form for citing menu items has been arbitrarily
decided as Menu > [Submenu >] Menu Item (encased within a <span
class="menuPath"> to keep consistency with the Mozilla Firefox site."
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/help-viewer/documentation_coding-style.php#use_correct_element

(I won't bother about spaces in the future, I completely forgot they're
invisible in (x)html.)

That was me thinking that it would be good to keep it the same style as on
http://texturizer.net/firefox/tips.html#beh_reuse (possibly after some minor
discussion).  If it needs to change I don't think anyone will care too much.  I
don't think it'll be particularly helpful for l10n, tho, because I remember part
of the reason for the [Menu] > [Item] format was to help make them less
confusing (by being consistent) and easier to localize.
R.J., we need a decision here: Use "Menu > Menuitem" everywhere or nowhere.

nowhere
Steffen,

We simply don't have time for this. It's too close to the release. A lot of the
localizers have already started translating help and I wouldn't want to put them
through this radical of a change.

We can do this after 1.0.
WONTFIX because what's used now is good enough, should be understandable, and is
used on <http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/>.
See comment 0: "click on Tools from the menu bar and select the Themes menu item."
That should be "select Tools > Themes". Reopening.
