When I load some pages in Firefox, it does thermonuclear and I'm afraid it's going to leave wads of hot melted plastic from laptop in my lap.  The Oct-25 build doesn't exhibit this behavior, but more recent builds do.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the latest Firefox nightly.
2. Open the attached file.
3. Watch your machine slow to a grinding halt.

Open this page to kill the Nov-02 nightly build of FF3
Doesn't sound accessibility-related. Shouldn't it be fired under a more general component?
I just did some more testing: if I disable accessibility support, the problem goes away.  :-(  So...this looks like it might be a problem specific to accessibility.

We just need to stop walking the frames. It's causing too many issues, including bug 359204.
