With branch build 20031218, "open as tabs" in the bookmark menu does nothing. No
Javascript errors in console either. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Bookmarks menu
2. Expand any folder in the menu with bookmarks
3. Click on "Open as tabs"

Yeah, I see this as well, using installer branch build 20031218 on win2k - no
extensions.
Seeing this nasty bug on my own homemade installer build -> Mozilla/5.0

Hmmm :

One of thoses patches could be guilty ?

They modify all bookmarks file.

Just an idea, of course :)
Does anyone know which build and/or which checkin broke this?
fixed on branch and trunk, thanks for the report!
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
