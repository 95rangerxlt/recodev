Minefield often freezes and lags when watching flash videos, seemingly more when in an inactive tab. This has only happened to me since Electrolysis was implemented into Minefield. This has occurred so far on Youtube and blip.tv.

This is on 4GB of RAM by the way.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Watch a flash video.
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Minefield freezes or lags.

Expected Results:  
No lag.

maybe bug 542447 (--> bug 542263), although it's not clear why it sometimes hangs and sometimes crashes
Apparently, for whatever reason, moving the mouse around seems unfreeze it.
Yeah, I'm seeing this with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20100131 Minefield/3.7a1pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) ID:20100131043113. Pandora is something that is also causing the freeze. But it isn't a proper freeze. The window doesn't respond to clicks, but I can go down the the windows 7 taskbar, click a tab preview, and then switch to another tab and it works fine until I switch back to the tab with the flash content.
Related to bug bug 539964 maybe?

Seems so. This one is more general though, and with the new implementation of Electrolysis. The old implementation accessible by about:config was not the same one that is built-in by default into Minefield, it was changed. I remember I tried the dom.ipc.tabs.enable before it was enabled by default, and it broke full-screen function on Youtube as well as other bugs.

By the way I noticed the freezing bug on PDF files too, it seems any plugin can cause it.

Lastly, there was an article released on Electrolysis: http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2010-01-27/multi-process-plugins-on-by-default/

To anyone having the problem ,you can disable Electrolysis by setting dom.ipc.plugins.enabled to "true" in about:config.
I meant set dom.ipc.plugins.enabled to "false" to disable, sorry.
This bugs seems to be fixed now. I'm not getting any problems now.
