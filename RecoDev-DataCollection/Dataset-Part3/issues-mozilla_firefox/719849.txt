-Cu.import("resource:///modules/source-editor.jsm");
+let tempScope = {};
+Cu.import("resource:///modules/source-editor.jsm", tempScope);
+let SourceEditor = tempScope.SourceEditor;

this is a good pattern, but I wish it weren't necessary every time.

Does SimpleTest really not tear-down its environment after each test instance? Seems like we could do something there.

in any case, this looks solid. Should land ASAP.

All browser chrome tests run in the same browser window, so if you add something to the window object, it's going to stick around. SimpleTest can't clean this up. The browser chrome test suite could open a new window for each test...

Thanks, but it's "D達o" with a tilde. (One reason why I usually push my stuff myself.)

Sorry D達o (proving that I *can* type the tilde). I've had bad luck with UTF characters in push comments before so I left it out. If the spelling's really annoying, feel free to backout and repush.

I wanted to land this on fx-team to let people who have in-progress patches that they might have to rebase some test code rather than get bit by a merge from inbound.

if you're on Win you may try with "hgencoding=utf-8 hg command", it worked for me in the past
