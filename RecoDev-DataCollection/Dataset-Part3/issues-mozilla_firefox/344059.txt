As of now, we always write the search engine metadata using mozStroage on shutdown. We should only do this if this metadata changed.

    if (this._needToSetOrderPrefs) {
      engineMetadataService.setAttr(engines[i], "order", i+1);
      dump("into saveSortedengineList\n");
      var engines = this._getSortedEngines(false);
      // here ----->
      for (var i = 0; i < engines.length; ++i)
        engineMetadataService.setAttr(engines[i], "order", i+1);
      // -----------
    }

If we expand engineMetadataService.setAttr(engines[i], "order", i+1) we get something like :
for ....
  begin transaction
  query
  end transaction

and that's the problem in bug 341850 (i.e. use of transactions in a bad way). 

This is meant to be applied in addition to the patch in that bug - it's just moving the current code.

OH ok :) So mv 'comment #2' /dev/null

This patch needs to be updated now that bug 341850 landed.

Just return early if (!_needToSetOrderPrefs), and save the indentation.

Also, I think you should set _needToSetOrderPrefs in an else block after http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/search/nsSearchService.js&rev=1.63#2329 .

OK. Think I got it this time...

Set _needToSetOrderPrefs to true inside the if() block at:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/search/nsSearchService.js&rev=1.64&mark=2220#2220
and r=me. Might also want to add something like "this needs to happen anytime _sortedEngines is modified after initial startup" to the comment near _needToSetOrderPrefs's declaration.

This patch has been on trunk since Thursday with no known regressions. It makes writing the order of search engines on shutdown only take place if the order has actually changed.
