2. Open the toolbox, activate the Light theme
3. Select the Inspector panel, inspect "nightly-title" on the page
4. Select the Fonts side panel. The font-preview foreground color is black
5. Go to the Options panel and activate Dark theme
6. Go back to the Inspector panel. The font-preview foreground color is still black -> BUG it should be white

If you change selection in the Inspector panel the font-preview is properly updated.

Nice work, very simple, I like the test, easy to read.
The patches from bug 1169993 need to land with this one or this patch causes a perma-orange.

Do they need to land together, or is it just that 1169993 needs to land first?

First or at the same time, doesn't really matter. If there's a working setTheme method available, the test works. If not, the test times out.
