QNX-only proposed changes for ARM platform, 1.8 branch

The changes in this patch were made in a way so that non-QNX code is not affected.

QNX-only proposed changes for ARM platform, 1.8 branch

Please get appropriate reviews and land on trunk before asking for branch check-in approval.

Would also inspire more confidence if this were assigned to a person. Since you patched it that probably should be you.

QNX-only proposed changes for ARM platform, 1.8 branch

I did not carefully review the assembly because I don't know ARM, so I'm trusting you to have it right.
Landed on trunk, waiting for branch approval:

QNX-only proposed changes for ARM platform, 1.8 branch

QNX needs this checked into the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH for Firefox 2.0-based browser.
branch status is handled through request flags and "fixed1.8.1.x" keywords, bug is fixed on trunk

approved for 1.8.1.10, a=dveditz. We're building soon (tomorrow?) so actual landing might be in 1.8.1.11 depending on how soon you get to it.

approved for 1.8.1.12, a=dveditz for release-drivers

Please land on the early side of the release so it doesn't miss the code-release window.
