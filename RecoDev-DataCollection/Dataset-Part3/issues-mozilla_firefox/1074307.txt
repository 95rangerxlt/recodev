Next steps:

- Meet with Growth Team to come up with message/theme concepts for helping users with their browser problems; find a balance between emotion and action.
We need to be careful with the "data to collect" items, and even the "It looks like you're downloading $BROWSER" notification part should probably have a privacy review just to be sure. Specifically, this could be viewed as a form of tracking/monitoring user activity. For well-intentioned and non-advertising purposes, obviously, but that distinction may not be relevant.
