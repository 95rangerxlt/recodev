STR:

1. Right click toolbar, choose Customize
2. Click "Restore default set"
3. Look at error console, see

Error: this._getParentSearchbar() has no properties
Source File: chrome://browser/content/search/search.xml
Line: 583

I sort of suspect this is the fault of the toolbar binding, for not having a currentSetWrapped setter that will call insertItem asking for a wrapper, but I'm not really sure.
