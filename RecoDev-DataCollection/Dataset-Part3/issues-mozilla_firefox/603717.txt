Margaret: do we need a new string for this, or do we already have it?

There's a "Connecting..." string in the sync locale files, but the right thing to do would be to add our own string to tabbrowser.properties (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/tabbrowser.properties).
I think we want to be able to get at the following strings, though for now only make use of the "Connecting" one. Should probably do this for b7 so that Axel isn't frowny-faces.

Strings to add to tabbrowser.properties:

Connecting…
Securing connection…
Searching…
Loading…
Waiting…
Downloading…

Localization note to include:

These will be used in the tab title or location bar to represent the various states as a web page loads.

What's the difference between Loading and Downloading? And what's "Securing connection"?

Asking because I don't know, and that's likely a good indication that localizers may have the same question.
In some cases the throbber will switch from the connecting state to the loading state but the title isn't ready to be shown in the tab yet. In this instance, the "Connecting..." string should switchover to "Loading..." with the throbber switch until the title is available to show.

Downloading is getting the data (page, images, scripts, etc.) from the server.
Loading is reading the downloaded data to produce what the user sees.

"Securing connection" is just a part of "Connecting" in the instance of a secured connection. Does a status for this need to be shown separately and would it even be shown long enough to be useful?

There's also the old problem of using the word "secure" when generally it's meaning "encrypted", which is not necessarily the same thing.

strings

r+ with the following nits:

LOCALIZATION NOTE: the following strings can be used in the tab title or location bar to represent various states as a web page loads:
 tabs.connecting = Firefox is sending a HTTP connection request
 tabs.securingConnection = Firefox is sending a HTTPS connection request
 tabs.searching = Firefox is searching for something (Awesomebar or Web search)
 tabs.loading = Firefox is loading the web page
 tabs.waiting = Firefox is waiting for a web resource to load
 tabs.downloading = Firefox is downloading a file for a helper application (PDF)
Also note that this bug is about allowing us to use tabs.connecting instead of tabs.loading for the connection state. Future bugs will be filed about making use of the other states, and how to use them so that the location bar / tab title doesn't become "twitchy".
Firefox or brandShortName? Not that brandShortName is trivial in .properties.

Also, should tabs.securingConnection be tabs.encryptingConnection? Not user visible, but may help internally.

The strings are fine as Margaret's patch has them; I meant for that to all be one big ol' localization note so that your l10ners would have a better idea.

Sure.
