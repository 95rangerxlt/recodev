To make firefox a true Unicode application, we need to get rid of 'A' API calls throughout the tree along with 'native' API invocations of nsILocalFile.

wooohoo!  This means that alot of the windows ce shunt can go away. 

What about backward compat... Are W routines available everywhere we care about?

Yes, they're because we dropped the support for Win 9x/ME in gecko 1.9. Gecko 1.8.x is the last branch to support them. See, for instance, bug 330276 and bug 359808.




Should bug 330276 and bug 359808 be set as blocking this?

No. Win 9x/ME support was dropped even before they're fixed due to our switch to cairo so that we're free to use W APIs here. 
I'll try and take a look at this. I guess I should also try and move all the native Windows registry API calls over to the |nsIWindowsRegKey| class while I'm at it.

Ryan, the code looks solid - excellent patch! I'm going to compile this before r+'ing to check a couple of things and will most likely r+ later today. Thanks!

nit: indent consistently

Once we get a unicode aware installer (e.g. MSI) we'll be in much better shape!

Ryan, please don't forget to update the patch prior to landing since gopher support has been removed.

Unless this needs a sr is it OK to request checkin?

Asking approval1.9 to remove this comma.
Comment on attachment 283158
fix mingw build failure

I filed a new bug to get approval1.9 for this patch, because this is probably missed by drivers thus far, see bug 403771.
