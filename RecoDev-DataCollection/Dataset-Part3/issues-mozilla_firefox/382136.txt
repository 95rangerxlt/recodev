Not possible to highlight a separator. At least it should take no action when nothing is highlighted. This looks related to Bug 381767 if I understand that bug correctly.
I managed to delete them sometimes but you need a pixel magnifier for that. You need to place your mouse carefully on the line or on the pixel below that line.

Yeah, a pixel magnifier might help me ;-)
It doesn't matter that much though.

We should NEVER delete a bookmark if it isn't selected/highlighted.
I'm having problems reproducing this on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a6pre) Gecko/20070612 Minefield/3.0a6pre.

Peter / Ria:  are you still able to reproduce it?
Yeah, fully.
I'm able to reproduce this.

1)  create a new profile
2)  open the bookmarks menu, open the "Mozilla Firefox" menu, right click on "Open in Tabs" and create a new separator (which will add it to the bottom, under "About us" bookmark.
3)  open the bookmarks menu, open the "Mozilla Firefox" menu, right click on the separator under "About us" bookmark, delete

actual results:

a) about us bookmark is deleted

expected results:

b) separator is deleted
after a bit of debugging, here's what I think is going on:

_removeRange() in controller.js is getting called with the wrong range.

specifically, we are getting called with the last bookmark that was active.

the reason is that in menu.xml, we set the view's selection when the DOMMenuItemActive event is handled, but that event is not getting fired for separators.

Additionally, I think we might want to clear the selection (set this._selection = null) on the DOMMenuItemInactive event.
as for how this worked in firefox 2, see http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/bookmarks/content/bookmarksMenu.js#173

the fix helps explain why it can be tricky to reproduce this.

menu.xml also contains a handler for mousedown that will also set the selection.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/places/content/menu.xml#750

but it can be really tough to click EXACTLY on the pixel for the separator.

If you do, we fire the mousedown, and the event.target is the menuseparator, and things will work as expected.

miss it slightly, and you think you are going to delete the menuseparator, but you are really not, and since we don't clear the selection (on DOMMenuItemInactive), you end up deleting the last bookmark that was active.

note, this is a windows only bug since mac doesn't allow you to do context menus on bookmark menus.

actually, might be better to set the selection to the result note.

testing that patch now...

for now, I think this is correct as it prevents dataloss.

In this scenario, you'll only be able to do new folder, new bookmark, new separator.  all other other commands will be disabled.

from some quick testing, we've got a bunch of bugs with context menus of containers and of the generated ("Open in Tabs" and "Open <feed name">) menu items which I'll spin off.

see bug #384375.
fixed.

Checking in menu.xml;

note, this patch caused a regression, see bug #384763
I can't get any context menu off of the bookmarks menu following the instructions in comment 5. Is there some special trick to this or do you mean the sidebar?
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
