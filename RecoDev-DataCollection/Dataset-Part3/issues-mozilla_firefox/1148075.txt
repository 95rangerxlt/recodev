This is prep work for modularizing the frontend a bit. I want to reduce globals and right now the <command> elements add an event handler as a string in the DOM, which requires global access. Let's allow each component to dynamically add commands.

Can you take a look especially how I added the utils file to jar.mn? I have no experience with that. This worked though.
Hi James, I don't think I'm the best person to review this patch. I have limited experience with XUL, and I have no experience with jar.mn either. I think Victor would be a good candidate to take a look at this.

Victor, could you do me a favor and take a look at this patch for me?
