flashblock-1.5.19a1.xpi

This is the latest version of Flashblock (there are no e10s specific changes)
Note sure this is a dupe. Need clearer explanation of what is going on.

Jonathan, please provide detailed steps to reproduce with what you observe is broken vs what is expected.  Thank you.
Still same with version above.
There used to be bug 946932 for e10s

Steps:
Clean nightly profile (ie e10s enabled)
Install flashblock and restart
Visit http://www.adobe.com/uk/software/flash/about/
Flash is blocked correctly
Customize toolbar and add the flashblock button
Click button to disable blocking. (Shows green circle)
Click refresh

Expect flash to load. Instead flash content is still behind block.
Same thing when things are whitelisted by type:

Flashblock> settings> uncheck "Block HTML5 as well"

Expected: HTML5 videos unblocked.

Result: Nah, still blocked.

It works correctly when e10s is disabled.
As noted in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1192022#c4 I hope to fix this by this week.

Flashlock version working around this bug

This is a 1.5.19 release candidate, based on the version uploaded by Philip Chee in comment 1, which apparently fixes this bug.

Philip, could you please review it and, if it looks good to you, merge and submit to AMO?
Will do. Thanks.

Phil, any news? Firefox 42 is behind the corner now...

I've just integrated your changes. Looks good. I'll upload a new version to AMO soon-ish.
Fixed and submitted to AMO, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashblock/versions/?page=1#version-1.5.19
