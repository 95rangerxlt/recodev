So we have landed code here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/

It is not compiled yet, and before doing so, I'd like to make sure we're getting l10n right. Locales code is not hosted in /browser/locales/ because we want this tool to be able to live outside of Firefox at some point.

Can someone from l10n could look at this and help me make sure we're doing the right thing here?

'webide' sounds like a huge pile of strings, there are currently only a few. I'm curious what the final scope of the project is going to be.

Technically, the placing of the files should work. I'd really like to leave those file out of localization until we're switching the feature on by default, or only shortly before that. In particular if the UI you have right now is going through some churn still, we don't need to do stuff like key changes until we officially start the l10n process.

The goal is to replace the App Manager. See some screenshots there:

Apparently, it does.

How do I do that without removing the .dtd and .properties?
Oh, a test fail on Linux:

KeyError: 'webide'
make[3]: *** [repackage-zip] Error 1
make[2]: *** [repackage-zip-x-test] Error 2
make[1]: *** [l10n-check] Error 2
make: *** [l10n-check] Error 2

Any idea of what I'm doing wrong?
I think the best way to do that is to make the jar.mn and the chrome files register and reference chrome://content instead of chrome://locale, and to make sure there's no l10n.ini in which browser/devtools/webide is picked up.

I wish our packager wasn't so picky in this situation, or at least explained why it's failing.

don't use chrome://locales

Ok. First step, we move .dtd and .properties in content. We'll revert that once the project is stable enough.

Setting leave-open, because I think that's what we want. I'm expecting follow-ups to actually switch stuff on when it's time, and that's fine to do in this bug. Paul, agree?

I'm far from familiar with the build system, but why are you keeping l10n files in /webide/locales?
Shouldn't they be moved to /browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/?
Try again with this patch, and that will make the error message a bit more explicit about what's wrong:

We're trying to keep WebIDE's code selfcontained, for maybe one day extract it as an addon or a xulrunner app.

Maybe it's not that simple. If not, I'll just move code into browser/locales
With Mike's patch: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=524256d9cb56
Note, we're missing a fragment in browser/locales/l10n.ini to pick up browser/devtools/webide.

I'm not too exited that we're having overlays of overlays of overlays in the browser file tree, tbh. It's just horrible to find the en-US files at this point. I'd really prefer to have devtools files in one spot beneath browser/devtools/locales/en-US

No idea how the packaging side works, though.

I'm not confident enough about how locales work to bypass the usual locales build system. And the value of isolating locales in /webide/ is almost null at this time. Let's go for the regular way.

So for now, I'll move webide files into /browser/locales/. But we could file a bug about moving locales in /browser/devtools/.

I realized I haven't looked at the strings in a while. Some minor nits since you're going to expose them for localization (not sure if you want to that here on in another bug).
