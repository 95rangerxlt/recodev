This patch removes the shortcut of start up DOMi for Firefox.

Should we remove the shortcut key from Firefox any more?
buildButtonsTooltip in inspector.jsm could just handle this by returning in case key is null.

I agree it is simple to resolve this bug.
However, at now, the need of DOM inspector is not high. It is rather low. I think that it is not necessarily useful that DOM inspector override the invoking keyset of Firefox default inspector...
Well, anybody without a need for DOMi can disable or uninstall it...
I use it way more often than the built-in inspector, since the latter doesn't work in chrome land.
Firebug is also add-on but it does not override the built-in keyset. I understand this may relate the historical reason.

Firebug provide fully upward compatible functions for the current built-in inspector. Also DOMi provides similar upward compatible functions but they are different from the direction of Firebug/built-in inspector. If Firebug overrides the built-in keyset, DOMi's overriding behavior may proper. But Firebug does not it. So I said that DOMi should not override the keyset of built-in inspector *any more* because I thought the direction of DOMi is not same for Firebug/built-in inspector ones.

Or I propose that we'll implement the preference for switching a behavior to override the default keyset.
Whatever we do, we shouldn't remove the key without a replacement.

FWIW, it would be appropriate for Firebug to hijack key_inspectPage since it basically implements the same feature.
OK.

I'll make a patch for buildButtonsTooltip in inspector.jsm could handle this by returning in case key is null for releasing DOMi 2.0.12.

And I file a bug later for replacing the invoke key for DOMi.

Need I change this bug's "Product" & "Component"?

Why do you move the brackets here and don't keep it in inspector.properties?
DOM Inspector is switching to a scheduled release cycle (bug 746784).  dom-inspector branches for localization today.  2.0.12 will not block for this.  There is no question that this is a problem, though.

In this case, DOM Inspector's slow development pace is fortunate.  Since this shouldn't involve any string changes, if you can come up with a patch (soon) for DOM Inspector that *conditionally* removes the devtools inspector's key, or remaps it, or something (in contrast to unconditionally clobbering it as we do now, see attachment 466560 from bug 569054), I will accept it on dom-inspector.

Since this bug is now concerned with how the devtools inspector end of things, please file a new bug for the DOM Inspector bits, or feel free to repurpose bug 688183.  Please keep in mind the condition I mention in bug 688183, comment 5, though: no approach will be accepted where Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I, by default, doesn't open DOM Inspector when it's installed.

If the case for key returns null when the keyset is overrided, the shortcut key string for tooltip will be empty strings.
So the tooltip will be shown "Select element with mouse ()" if I do not move the brackets from inspector.properties. This is strange.

I see.

I would prefer if you could create a new property for this case, like we did here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/inspector.properties#29

Can you also add a comment in this code to explain why sometimes the key is not accessible?

Thank you.

PS:

There's at least one localization that doesn't use (), http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla-aurora/source/zh-TW/browser/chrome/browser/devtools/inspector.properties#34

Also, if you make changes like this, you'd need to update the key name. Paul's suggestion for an additional string sounds right.

Nice word creation ;-)
I guess the "n" is a typo, though.

The patch attached here would require a string change and would have l10n impact. If bug 735214 is the regressing bug, should we consider backing that out from Aurora?
What if we just don't set the tooltip at all for Aurora if there's no <key> element, and for nightly, we add the extra string?

Make this one LOCALIZATION NOTE for each string and make sure to reference the right string name in both cases.
Rename inspectButton.tooltipWithAccesskey to inspectButtonWithAccesskey.tooltip.

Should we follow the naming rules in same file, like markupButton.tooltipWithAccesskey?

Make this two LOCALIZATION NOTEs, one for inspectButtonWithAccesskey.tooltip and one for inspectButton.tooltip.

And again, please move 'let separator' up like Paul did in his patch. It's probably best if you just start with Paul's patch and add your modifications to that.

nit: } else { on one line

>+# LOCALIZATION NOTE (inspectButtonWithAccesskey.tooltip):

Actually, inspectButtonWithAccesskey doesn't make sense, since this is a shortcut key rather than an access key. So we need a better name, such as inspectButtonWithShortcutKey.tooltip.

> # This button appears in the Inspector Toolbar. inspectButton is stateful,
> # if it's pressed users can select an element with the mouse.

This change can be avoided.

>+# LOCALIZATION NOTE (inspectButton.tooltip):
>+# This button appears in the Inspector Toolbar. inspectButton is stateful,
>+# if it's pressed users can select an element with the mouse.
>+# If the key of inspect is overridden by other addons,

Just cut this down to:

# Same as inspectButtonWithShortcutKey.tooltip but used when an add-on
# overrides the shortcut key.

It's pretty darned high if you actually want to inspect at DOM in a sane tree view in a separate window from the web page, fwiw.
