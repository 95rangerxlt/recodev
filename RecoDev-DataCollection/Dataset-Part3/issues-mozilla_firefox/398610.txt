To be honest, I don't see a difference in behaviour (hoped that would help against the z-index problem but it doesn't). Therefore, I don't go for review now

This helps against icons in the bookmark menu or bookmark bar to be displayed bigger than 16x16 (which some do after the movements in bug363130). When I use exactly the same patch as for winstripe/global/menu.css our menu-check mark grows to 16px (that's not so good looking ;-). Therefore the max- prefix. Alternatively, one could enter a fixed value fore the size of menu-check.png

That site's changed their icons. You can use the engine at http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=btjunkie&opensearch=yes&skipcache=yes&submitform=Search for the moment, I think, but any engine with an icon that's larger than 16x16px should work.

Actually, I didn t see the searchbar problem (and shouldn t this be fixed by now?) but I had some big icons in my bookmarks-menu and -bar.

It doesn't really make sense to add panel to both sections.

The new bookmark panel (the one that opens when clicking on the URL bar star) is such a panel. I think it looks nicer when adding it to the popup so that it gets the 2px top border.

Btw, should we not be able to merge the two blocks into one and add a small new block just for the two lines of 1px top border of menupopups?

I merged it, and so far it seems to work.
What I still don't like is that the top border of the add-bookmark panel with this patch comes in line with the top border of the lower location bar. (IIRC that is however the same in windows)

I think this should be used only for the 1px border case. So use this one

here, and the one with only ThreeDHighlight for the new menupopup section. Gives a small but noticeable difference.

looking deeper at the patch for bug400703 not the organizer.css changes seem to be crucial but http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?command=DIFF&subdir=%2Fmozilla%2Fbrowser%2Fcomponents%2Fplaces%2Fcontent&file=places.xul&rev1=1.104&rev2=1.105&whitespace_mode=ignore&diff_mode=context (removed a bunch of whitespace fixes) where the places bar was changed from separate toolbarbuttons to menus in a menubar
<menubar id="placesMenu" chromedir="&locale.dir;">                        
<menu accesskey="&organize.accesskey;" class="menu-iconic"
Obviously on native themes that makes no visible difference but on OS/2 it does.

[checked in] follow-up of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=283609 (finetuning of menu text position)

This patch is in part a correction to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=283609. In the first hunk we have to move the start of non-iconic menu entries 1px to the right (open e.g. the bookmarks or history menu and you'll see that the non-iconic entries are 1px shifted to the left compared to the iconic entries). The second part is correcting a problem with the new dropdown panel for the unified forward/back button in firefox. When this list contains an URL without icon and one hovers over the entries the menubar seems to 'jump'. Moreover, when the list entries are short, and one hovers over the entry without icon the menubar expands the whole panel to the right. Testcase for this start,  ff, load os2.org (with favicon), load netlabs.org (no favicon) and again os2.org. Then dropdown the list and move the mouse over it. The panel expands to the right when hovering over netlabs.org

Should we make the new forward back arrows look more OS/2 alike?

Peter, I attached a screenshot how we could make the new forward / back arrows look more OS/2 alike. I mirrored and then changed the black/white borders of the Menu-arrow.png from toolkit\themes\pmstripe\global\menu. We would need to patch browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css with %ifdef XP_OS2... I'm having a patch for it, but wanted to get your opinion about it.
Comment on attachment 311375

I have to say that I find it rather confusing to see this arrow on the left of the menu. As this is not a standard OS/2 control I don't think we have to do it. (And I don't think it's a good idea to start ifdefing in the winstripe subdirectory.)

This is OS/2 only in an OS/2 only directory, doesn't affect the main build platforms. The risk (even for OS/2) should be closest to zero

This came just to my mind when puzzling at the menu things. I was myself not 100% convinced (for the reasons you mentioned) but thought it would be good to get another oppinion

So, the menu should have the appearance of a toolbarbutton, this works on windows (xp and vista) but not on OS/2. I played around with moz-apperance: whatever I entered after the colon wasn't respected.
Any ideas why this don't work are appreciated
Could it be that most or all of the -moz-appearance properties are ignored on OS/2 because we never implemented nsNativeThemeOS2? At some point I understood how these things worked but now I don't find it in the code any more.

> Could it be that most or all of the -moz-appearance properties are ignored on

That's what I suspected, but wasn't sure about. -moz-appearance is also ignored when you start WindowsXP with the classic theme. In classic theme under XP the main menus of the "library" don't look like buttons. So, I'm afraid we can't do anything else than hoping that there's gonna be a change in organizer.css.

I still haven't even looked at the places menu thing or organizer.css... 
Reminder to myself!

Two other things, though: I looked at bug 426732 and I think we need to do something about the OS/2 colors, too, like adding a few lines in nsLookAndFeel.cpp. Not sure if bug 427979 also calls for a similar solution for OS/2.

Built it and in principle this is indeed implemented. The only consumer so far is the downloadmanager. But it doesn't look different after the checkin for two reasons: first ecolor_moz_eventreerow and ecolor_moz_oddtreerow have the same value (SYSCLR_ENTRYFIELD). Secondly and more important before bug 429188 was checked in it was decided that winstripe (windows) shouldn't use alternate colors in downloadmanager
toolkit/themes/winstripe/mozapps/downloads/downloads.css
1.30 reed%reedloden.com 2008-04-04 02:06 Bug 426007 - "Remove alternating row colors in the download manager"
For testing if the checkin in nsLookAndFeel.cpp would work in principle I moved ecolor_moz_oddtreerow to have SYSCLR_MENU and reimplemented the alternate backgroundcolors in downloadmanager.css and it shows now for odd rows a grey background. So, as said in principle it would work but no consumer at the moment and if we really want to have different even and odd row colors we would have to move ecolor_moz_oddtreerow to another place in nsLookAndFeel.cpp

I guess there is no native coloro for hyperlinks or an equivalent for COLOR_HOTLIGHT (used on windows) in OS/2, so we'd have to hardcode a color like mac does (aColor = NS_RGB(0x14,0x4F,0xAE);). Or what are you thinking?

For the link color I'm pretty happy with what the default is now (#0000ef), perhaps we should just hardcode that. The darker blue that you quoted doesn't fit as nicely on OS/2 as it probably does for MacOSX.

As for the download manager banding I'm not sure what to do. Just using a completely different color property because it gives some grayish value seems wrong to me. Is there any other (native/PM) OS/2 app that does banding somehow? I can't think of any, if you can't, either, then let's forget about it.

This should just be an example, how other platforms than windows do. I would guess as long as we do not experience weird colors in hyperlinks, we should probably leave it as is, a patch for hardcoding the link color would be relatively easy to apply in case, another UI change will result in bad coloring of hyperlinks.

With regard to the grayish color, that was as said only a test, if the new variables do work for OS/2, and they do. So if ever we need to change something, we know now, that we only need a change in our nsLookAndFeel.cpp and wouldn't have to change other files (like for gtk in bug 427979).
With regard to the downloadmanager I just rebuilt again, now there is a faint grey band between the individual downloads and it looks quite ok (and its the same on windows), so for the moment we can let it as it is.

As there were problems with the classic theme on windows, too, they checked in Bug 421529 - Menu items in bookmarks manager don't get a hovered look anymore with classic theme.
For us, now the button-like appearance is back again, when the menu is inactive and you hover over it. The only remainder that this is defined as a menu is the bold text and when you press such a menu you get the menu background color. So, it has gotten better, maybe not optimal but as we would have to do sth in a browser/winstripe css file, I think we should leave it for the moment as is, probably there will be other changes in the near future.

I'm not sure I understand why this is needed - does OS/2's native style implementation have different semantics for "-moz-appearance: toolbarbutton" or "color: -moz-DialogText"? Either way, would be nice to add a preprocessor comment ("% " prefixed) explaining that this is a fix for OS/2.
Gavin, thanks. Yes, "-moz-appearance: toolbarbutton" has no effect for OS/2 because we never found time to implement nsNativeThemeOS2.
