Go to any university professor's website (like http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/). It won't have any CSS. Load the Style Editor and see that it just shows the spinning loading indicator instead of letting you know there aren't any style sheets.

This is a regression from bug 816967. A testcase should be added for it as well.

Show 'no style' message if there aren't any sheets on page load +test

This patch reverts this regression. The remote style editor was individually sending 'stylesheet-added' events with no concept of document load, in anticipation of bug 839103. It now has a 'document-load' event with all the stylesheets available on the page load, so that we can check if there are none.

We can add back 'stylesheet-added' events when bug 839103 is fixed, right now it has no real use.
