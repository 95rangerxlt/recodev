The increment behavior using arrow keys (UP/DOWN) is different for 0.x values from .x values.

If the value is .9 and the UP arrow key is pressed the new value is .10 when it should be 1 (if you consider how it works for the [.1, .9] interval)

If the value is .9 and the UP arrow key is pressed the new value is .10 when it should be 1 (if you consider how it works for the [.1, .9] interval)
The problem is with a regex that matches the value [1] the rule always expects at least one digit before the dot (\d+) but that digit is optional, it should be \d*

Because of the failed match the value does not validate as a num [2] and gets incremented differently.

Right now browser/devtools/styleinspector/test/browser_ruleview_edit-property-increments.js is failing I'll have to look into that.

This looks good, but we'll need a testcase for it. I bet you could add one to that test file that was failing: browser_ruleview_edit-property-increments.js
Sure thing :)

Looks good, thank you. Can you do a Try run with the devtools tests?
