I thought I was able to remove some complexity in Bug 991810 by removing the #toolbox-tabs piece out of this selector:

.theme-light #toolbox-tabs .devtools-tab[selected]

But no, that was guaranteeing that even on an active state the background color would be the same.  So if you hold a mouse down on the already selected tab, it currently becomes grey, but is fixed with this patch.
