fix build config so that if anti-phishing is enabled, canvas is enabled

in my ff 2.0 / 1.8 branch build the anti-phishing feature doesn't work.

I get a grey page, and then the browser doesn't work properly (see attached screen shot).

In my console I get:

************************************************************
* Call to xpconnect wrapped JSObject produced this error:  *
[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VAL
UE) [nsIDOMHTMLCanvasElement.getContext]"  nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEG
AL_VALUE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///c:/builds/bonecho/mozilla/ff-debug/di
st/bin/components/nsSafebrowsingApplication.js :: anonymous :: line 3047"  data:
 no]
************************************************************

Tony tells me the problem is that I need to build with canvas enabled.

he suggested we make it so if anti-phishing / safe browsing is enabled, canvas is enabled.

note:  Safe Browsing works fine with the official bon echo builds.

screen shot of ff 2.0 when safe browsing is used and canvas is not build
I coulda sworn I made canvas/svg on-by-default on the 1.8branch (they are on-by-default on trunk). warning/erroring during configure is good: having safe-browsing implying canvas enabled is bad.
chatting with bsmedberg over irc, the right thing to do is follow what he did on the trunk (both enabling MOZ_ENABLE_CANVAS (see http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/configure.in#4002) but then disabling it for things like minimo.
updating summary.

following what bsmedberg did for #311198

thanks to bsmedberg for the guidance.

patch coming...

patch for mozilla/configure.in (will let the cltbld bot rebuild mozilla/configure ?)

rebuilding with this one now...
> rebuilding with this one now...

my patch built fine, just waiting for a review from bsmedberg,

note, the poor man's solution to this is to just do --enable-canvas in your mozconfig, but I think it should be enabled by default (for ff) since safe browsing is also enabled by default.
I plan on landing later tonight / tomorrow, as soon as I know I'll be around to watch tbox and deal with any problems.
fix landed on the 1.8 branch.  this change is not necessary on the trunk, as bsmedberg already made a similar (but different) change to mozilla/configure.in on the trunk.
