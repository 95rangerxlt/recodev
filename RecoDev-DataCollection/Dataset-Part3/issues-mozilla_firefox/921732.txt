Currently the bookmarks widget shows several icons when placed in the palette and a bigger font size when placed in the menu. It needs a proper icon and the font size should be adjusted.

This fixes the full icon set (the dropmarker was being shown inadvertewn inadvertently), it fixes the icon size on OS X retina (too small because it didn't match any of the panel minsize stuff), and it fixes the text size.

No, but those selectors were redundant, because those cases are already selected by the cui-areatype="menu-panel" selectors above it, and as I was editing this rule anyway, I removed them.
