The useragent string says Gecko 1.8, but that's incorrect since we have taken Gecko changes on the 1.8 branch.  It should probably say "1.8.1a1" to reflect the fact that it is an alpha 1 version of what will become Gecko 1.8.1.

Also, the GeckoVer registry key is wrong:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla\Bon Echo 2.0a1 [GeckoVer]
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Mozilla\Bon Echo 2.0a1 [GeckoVer]

These guys have a value of 1.7.5.

We should try to make sure that these version numbers are corrected for 2.0a2.

What should this be for 2.0a2? 1.8.1a2?
Probably, yeah.
Landed.
