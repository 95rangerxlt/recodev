r=me with some manual testing that the OOM error is properly recorded.

::: browser/components/sessionstore/SessionStore.jsm:795
(Diff revision 1)
> +        SessionStoreInternal.reportInternalError(data);

this.reportInternalError(data);

::: browser/components/sessionstore/content/content-sessionStore.js:717
(Diff revision 1)
> +    } catch (ex if
> +      (ex == Components.result.NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)
> +    ||(ex && typeof ex == "object" && ex.result == Components.result.NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY)

That's not super pretty... can exceptions really have those two forms? If we need both then maybe do:

try {
 ... 
} catch (ex if isOOMError(ex)) {
 ...
}

::: browser/components/sessionstore/content/content-sessionStore.js:724
(Diff revision 1)
> +      sendMessage("SessionStore:error"), {
> +        telemetry
> +      });

This isn't valid syntax, did you run tests and try that this sends errors to the parent as expected?
I admit I've been lazy with this first patch. I'll try and reproduce the OOM in a test, this should help.

Review ping?
Well if you set the r? flag then I'll see it in my dashboard :) Will take a look now.

It's great that you spent the time writing a test (which I think you forgot to 'hg add' btw) but I'm not a fan of such amounts of test functions in production code.

Can we somehow from the outside, maybe from another content script, override sendMessage? Otherwise I would prefer not landing a test (or rather not landing those test functions) and seeing whether the crash numbers drop.

Can we do:

} catch (ex if ex && ex.result == Components.results.NS_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY) {

Should work just as fine even if it's not an object.

Yeah, I hadn't realized that MozReview had turned it into a r+.
Thanks for the review.

Ah, good to know.
Ok, I managed to inject custom `sendSyncMessage`/`sendAsyncMessage` into the frame script. Ugly, but good to know.

This fails if ex==null (which probably can happen?). Should be |ex if ex && ex.result ...|.

The semantics of this `if` are... interesting.
