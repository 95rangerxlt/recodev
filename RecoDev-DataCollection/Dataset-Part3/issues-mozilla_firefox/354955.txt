Firefox 2.0rc1 works _very_ slowly on OS/2, this seems to be due to the recent changes to the Firefox winstripe default theme. I think this is because of bug 167884 (that cannot be solved on OS/2 currently) and the use of alpha-transparent, repeated PNG graphics to color the tabs and the tab-strip. The main offenders seem to be

   tab-left*.png
   tab-right*.png
   tab-middle*.png
   tabbrowser-tabs-bkgnd.png

The latter two are repeated in x-direction which is especially bad.

If nothing else helps browser.css has to be forked for OS/2, too, in such a way that none of these files are used.

Any chance of Harold gaining interest in the png code again?
Another thought, will a thebes build stay up long to see if the transparent png's work any better in it?

No, it doesn't come up at all last I tried (but it's high time that I work on that again). But this won't help for branch anyway...

Screenshot with a fix

OK, I attempted the fix by forking browser.css top pmstripe. This screenshot shows the result. In the image, the middle tab is selected, and the left one hovered.

I replaced the offending PNG with surfaces of a single color, that I computed by using the default OS/2 value of -moz-dialog (#cecfce) using the rgb+alpha values at the top of the tab-*.png files.  The drawback is of course that if someone has a non-standard value for their dialog background in OS/2, the tab colors will not adapt to that. But as opaque, repeated images are not an option, I don't think that we have much of a choice.

Patch upcoming.

v1 of a possible fix

OK, patch against 1.8 branch for review (should be identical for trunk). In parallel I will try to get some testing from the mozilla.dev.ports.os2 community.

bummer. Man I wish we could get an expert to help us with this problem.

v1 of a possible fix

ui-review is probably not necessary since this change is OS/2 only and doesn't really touch UI features.
Feedback from the newsgroup has shown that everybody is happy with the changes.

mkaply, as they don't allow checkins for 1.8 any more, can you please apply the patch before building the release? To be able to get this in soon after the release, I ask for blocking (which seems to be a prerequisite for approval).
yes, i will get this in the release.
This won't block the release of either gecko1.8.1.1 (though I can't unset that flag) or firefox2, but the patch can be submitted as a NPOTB non blocker and will most likely get accepted.
mkaply, if this is the right patch, could you nominate it for approval1.8.1?

this is the right fix.
It's os/2 only so we'd love to take it so we don't have to add it by hand into our release.

a=beltzner on behalf of drivers (NPOTB)
OK, thanks. Checked in to trunk and branch.
Oops, forgot to mark fixed...
