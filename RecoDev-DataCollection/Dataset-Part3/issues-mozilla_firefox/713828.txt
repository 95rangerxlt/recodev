page-proxy-stack is unnecessary, as it contains only one node (page-proxy-favicon). In pinstripe, page-proxy-stack can be removed right away. In winstripe and gnomestripe, it has padding which should be converted to margin on page-proxy-favicon.

Thanks!

A flawless first patch -- something you don't see very often. :)
It was a great example of good first bug although there was not much to fix.
