We should automatically black box sources whose URL ends with ".min.js" or "-min.js" or whatever. Probably safe to use the regexp /\bmin\.js$/

I agree that we need to do this, but some users hate this kind of automatic-behind-your-back smart behavior, as it can sometimes go wrong. I think providing a new option in the debugger UI or even just a pref to control the black-boxing could empower those users who draw the short straw.

Nit: indentation is off here, dots should be aligned.

This patch puts it behind a pref and adds an options menu item for toggling it.
