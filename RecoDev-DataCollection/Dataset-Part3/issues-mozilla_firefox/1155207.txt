Some investigation:
  Look's like, it happens when mouse moves over XULelements like address string at top browser.
In this case:
  (aTargetFrame1->GetContent() != aTargetContent) And (aTargetContent != nullptr)
So what is aTargetFrame1->GetContent() and what is aTargetContent?
In case address string we have:
[nsTextFrame] and [nsTextNode] at PresShell::HandlePositionedEvent()
but [nsTextNode] is not IsElement() and we need to get parent.
As result we find [HTMLDivElement].
After it we put [nsTextFrame] and [HTMLDivElement] into mCurrentEventFrame and mCurrentEventContent.
In this case mCurrentEventFrame is not related with mCurrentEventContent,
but obviously this comparison
> nsContentUtils::ContentIsDescendantOf(mCurrentEventFrame->GetContent(), mCurrentEventContent)
should be true.

frame_and_content_ver1.diff

This is too relaxing.
Just explicitly check that
aTargetFrame->GetContent() == aTargetContent ||
aTargetFrame->GetContent()->GetParent() == aTargetContent

+ Changed comparison for more harder check

It resolves issue with address string, but I cannot check if another cases exist.

If nobody have objections, I put checkin flag.
