1. Open multiple tabs
2. Press Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab

Actual Results:  
Location Bar is selected

Expected Results:  
Move to next/previous tab

Works for me in yesterdays' branch version (I didn't test on the trunk) :
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041016
Firefox/1.0
I can reproduced in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;
rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041018 Firefox/0.9.1+

WFM in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.3)
Gecko/20041018 Firefox/1.0
Fixed in RC2.
You reported this bug against the trunk, and we already know that it's a
trunk-only bug, so finding out that it works correctly on the branch doesn't
make this FIXED or WORKSFORME.
This bug appears to be present for me under Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20041217 Firefox/1.0+

We can't drop any known keybinding at this point.
FYI: it doesn't break the orginal bug which removed it (bug 251513).

> We can't drop any known keybinding at this point.

Well... we will have dynamic keybindings at some point... ;)


Thanks for review, but it's intended (see bug bug 169589, ported to toolkit on
bug 251513)

see bug 275519 for new keybindings.

asaf: so the "fix" for bug 275549 was checked in 6/28/05.  any trunk nightly
after that is going to have this problem.

ff 1.0.6 still allows one to switch tabs with ctrl-tab.  i guarantee we're going
to see a lot of folks reporting this problem as soon as there is a real release
based on the trunk.  at the very least, we're going to need to relnote this.

can we pref this behavior, or something?
oops.. that should have been bug 275519 :(

hey come on - what do you mean "WONTFIX"???

this is doing my head in - i only just found the keyboard shortcut to switch between the tabs and had been loving it.....

seems like there are a LOT of people re-filing this bug in protest....

X! - indicates that the operating system uses that shortcut. Do not override these shortcuts.

X! - Control-Tab - Move focus to the next grouping of controls in a dialog or the next table (when Tab moves to the next cell). See Accessibility Overview.

X! - Shift-Control-Tab - Move focus to the previous grouping of controls. See Accessibility Overview.
Command+Option+Arrow doesn't reliably work in 1.5RC3. Sometimes nothing happens. Other times it changes tabs but is extremely slow.
Control-Tab and Control-(Shift)-Tab switch between open projects in Photoshop/mac.  It's been this way for a long time, and I love it.  Clearly, there are other applications that ignore the below guidelines (and that's what they are, guidelines).  I was very disapointed discover this feature missing in 1.5.

The main advantage of Control-Tab is that one can switch through tabs with one hand, and leave the other hand free to control the mouse.   Option-Command-Arrow forces you to use two hands.  Maybe there is a one-handed alternative?

Two main problems with this change:

1. It used to work, so everyone that got used to using ctrl-tab is going to think something is broken and get confused/mad or file a bug report.

2. It works just fine on other platforms.

I use Firefox on Windows all day at work and on Mac when I get home. Having the same shortcuts makes it much easier to move back and forth then trying to remember which shortcut works on which system.
It is broken.  I am confused and mad.  I saw a hack for editing the keybindings in some XML file, and at the very least I will link you, Jeff, if I can find it again.

It's really lame that there's no way to switch tabs with one hand on a Powerbook.  (Neither Cmd+Opt+Arrow nor Ctrl+PgDn can be used with one hand on a Powerbook keyboard.)

Switching tabs is much more common than keyboard-navigating between frames.  Ctrl+Tab was originally kept for switching frames on Windows, but it was changed to switching tabs when we realized this (see bug 136915 comment 59).  What makes Mac different?

Regarding comment 22, the Apple HIG is vague -- it refers to "groupings of controls", which doesn't necessarily include frames and could include tabs.  Also, the HIG doesn't override individual application usability when breaking with the HIG in a small way improves that application's usability a lot.
Btw, rumor has it that Tantek Ã‡elik (lead developer of the rendering engine for the now-defunct IE 5 for Mac) is using Firefox 1.0.x rather than Firefox 1.5 because of this.

Not quite right; you can switch tabs with Cmd+1,2,3.  But that hurts my hand beyond Cmd+4 (so it barely scales) and doesn't work as well for muscle memory.

wow, I don't remember being ok with wontfixing this, but I was Mac-deficient in the old days, so I might not have paid attention.  I guess I just don't browse one-handed on my powerbook that much...
Fixed on trunk.
