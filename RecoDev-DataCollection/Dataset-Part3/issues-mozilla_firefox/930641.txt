remove-allowMultipleWorkers.patch

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #906839 +++

The attached patch is an updated version of attachment 817770. After updating it, I checked that no file in the browser/ and toolkit/components/social/ folders contained a reference to allowMultipleWorkers, and I cleaned up the 3 tests that still touched that pref.

I'm requesting review from Mark now, but we agreed this shouldn't land until mozilla-central is mozilla 28.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks!
Is it now time to remove this pref (the patch here has bitrotted), or do we prefer to wait another cycle?
I think we can remove this - it isn't going to be too painful in the unlikely event of needing to back this out.

Patch v2

Requesting review again as the unbitrotted patch is significantly changed, but the changes were straightforward though.

Patch v3

Apparently I picked the wrong day to unbitrot this patch: bug 935640 landed, which means I had to unbitrot again ;).

simple enough, I'll r+ it.  Please do a try run before landing.
