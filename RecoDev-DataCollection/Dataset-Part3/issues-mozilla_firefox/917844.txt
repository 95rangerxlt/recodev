There currently is no keyboard shortcut or keyboard access key for the Browser Debugger.

Available keyboard shortcuts are few and far between, so I understand that we may not want to apply one to a hidden feature like the Browser Debugger. However, keyboard access keys are cheap and easy to arrive at.

We should add one to the menu, so keyboard navigation of this menu is improved.

Currently to access the Browser Debugger on Windows, I hit: Alt+T, W, Down × 9.

With a keyboard access key, I should be able to press: Alt+T, W, E.

(I found that E was the first letter in "Browser Debugger" that wasn't used already in a sibling access key.)
