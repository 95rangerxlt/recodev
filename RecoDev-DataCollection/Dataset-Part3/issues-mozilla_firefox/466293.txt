Patch (unified format diff file and l10n tree)

Trying to follow updated tree rules for cvs (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=442888#c8), I'm filing this bug:

- CCing Axel
- requesting for approval1.9.0.5
- attaching a patch for the change

The patch is a zip containing:

- gl.diff - Unified format diff file for the entire l10n/gl updated tree
- l10n_gl.zip - updated l10n/gl tree

Compare locales on updated l10n/gl tree says:

../gl/:
keys: 896
unchanged: 500
changed: 4614
90% of entries changed

PS: I setted the blocking1.9.0.5 flag; just tell me if that is not correct to do that.

r-. This looks partly like an old tree to me. In particular the changes to region.properties, list.txt and intl.properties regress things that have been fixed before. Please take an in-depth look to make sure that there are not other regressions, too.

In detail:

region.properties is reverted to an old version.

browser/searchplugins/list.txt is reverted to an old version.

toolkit/chrome/global/intl.properties re-introduces UTF-7, which is a security problem

Yep, you are right something went wrong while updating local CVS sorry for that.

This one keeps those files untouched (including l10n/l10n/gl/toolkit/installer/windows/charset.mk).

Thanks,

r/a=me, please land this with a check-in comment referencing this bug and my approval. Land the ebay change separately, though.

A comment like "bug 466293, update gl with community feedback, a=l10n@mozilla.com" would be good. Use the fixed1.9.0.5 and verified1.9.0.5 keywords to track landing and testing.
All landed to CVS (ebay change separately), included that comment. I included "fixed1.9.0.5" and "verified1.9.0.5" as keywords in the comments of the commit.

Dashboard is red, showing "failed moz_comparelocales" and still showing 36 missing strings, but here compare-locales says:

compare-locales browser/locales/l10n.ini . ../l10n/gl/
../l10n/gl/:
keys: 896
unchanged: 500
changed: 4616
90% of entries changed

Don't know if I might do something more in some other bug, moving flags or anything else; just tell me in that case.
The missing files are the translation of about:rights, I just filed bug 466387 to backport your work in hg to cvs.

I'll be doing some adaption of the 3.1 files for 3.0.5, so just OKing the changes in that bug will be good enough, no landing on your part is required.

As for the landings, please stay closer to the check-in comments I suggest. The keywords I mention are actually keywords on bugzilla, too, and not in the check-in comment. I already set the keyword for fixed, once you have verified the fixes in a build, please change the keyword in this bug to be verified1.9.0.5.

I'm so dumb... :)

Thanks for that, I'll change that keyword in that moment.

Succesfully tested 3.0.5pre (24/11/08, 21:18:00), fixes worked OK.

Changing keyword to verified1.9.0.5

Thanks!
If that's verified1.0.9.5, shall we close this bug?
I think so.
