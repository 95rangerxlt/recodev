Added search engines to search plugins
Does this stupid bug blocks the Greek 1.0 official release? This had to be
announced in some way in order not to miss the 1.0 release. 
Patch created. Please approve it
Raphael will need to approve this.

Rafael, I'm marking a review request for you here. Please review the list.txt
part.

I wanted to see what Rafael thinks about this list before causing more work,
please cvs add the src files and cvs add -kb the images and attach a 
cvs diff -uN
That way, I will see that the actual search plugins are ok, too.

Plugins are OK. Actually there is no need to add more plugins at this time. The
reason I asked for approval is because I thought that this bug was blocking the
1.0 official release. I will add the plugins later, when l10n will be back on
the trunk...
