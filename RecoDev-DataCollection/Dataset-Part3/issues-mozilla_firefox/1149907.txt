Bug 987360 introduced a tag annotation to our tests that can be used to run all tests with the same tag using "mach testsuite --tags mytag". We should add a devtools tag to all of our tests, so that we can easily run all devtools tests. Bug 1149695 will allow us to use a single command to run all tests, "mach test --tag devtools".

Add a devtools tag to all devtools tests

That was a lot of copy & paste!
TIL: we have more than 50k checks in devtools tests.

Thanks for doing this. Looks fine to me.
We'll need to update the doc on the devtools wiki.
Also, afaik, this won't let us run *all* devtools tests, we still have to specify which type of test to run, right? (mochitest, xpcshell)
That's right, "mach test --tag devtools" needs bug 1149695 to be fixed first. I'll update the wiki after I land this.
