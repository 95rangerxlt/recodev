patch

When we started using aero glass, I made the location bar and the search bar transparent, as they were directly on glass. This mimicked the Windows Explorer look. With tabs on top and the text fields rendered on a solid background, this doesn't make as much sense. It makes the grayed out text harder to read and the bookmarks star and the history dropmarker seem to fade into the background.

Note that this only affects aero glass. The location bar and the search bar are already opaque when using aero basic, luna, etc.

URL bar appears to be focused with this. Maybe I am just not used to it. Can a slightly transparent background be used?
The search box in the addon manager should also have a white background.
