Observed: When enabling "Settings > Developer > Show devtools overlay", an overlay is shown over apps when they are being started.

Expected: Not only should it work for apps that are later started, but also for apps that were already running when the setting was enabled.

To achieve this, the devtools layers should query the list of running apps and track them. This can be done by extracting the `listRunningApps` method of the webappsActor.

Shouldn't we also track the system app?
Thanks for the review! We currently don't track the system app, because we first need to figure out a good place to display its metrics information. (The bottom right on the home screen is already used by the home screen, maybe inside the drop-down menu?)
