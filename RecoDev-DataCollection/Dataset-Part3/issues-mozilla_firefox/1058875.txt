As mentioned in Bug 875871 comment 18 and 19, we should skip any currently failing e10s tests.  Then we will be able to track new tests that are added that break e10s

The markupview and framework tests are working locally but are leaking on Holly: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=46482670&full=1&branch=holly#error98
The orange tests can be seen here: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Holly
Down from 240 errors last week (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=46486215&tree=Holly&full=1) to 120 errors from the merge yesterday (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=46912519&tree=Holly&full=1)

This is a WIP that skips some common failures in e10s for devtools test suite
Moving DevTools test bugs to e10s milestone M7 (i.e. not blocking e10s merge to Aurora).
I'm not sure if I understand the scope of this bug. Is it useful to have a separate bug for getting the devtools tests green on Holly when we already have bugs to get the devtools tests green for E10s for each separate tool?

This can be closed now, since we have dt tests running in e10s on certain platforms in m-c/fx-team.  It was needed when the tests weren't running in any other environments.
