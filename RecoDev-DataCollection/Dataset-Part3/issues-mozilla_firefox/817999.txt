I suppose this is a remaining part of the downloads in status bar thing, with the new downlods indicator this unmaintained code is likely pointless.
also the #download-monitor styling.

Gavin, is there a reason this was not removed? does it support some add-on or whatever else? It just looks like dead code to me, the only add-on using it looks like FireTorrent

Huh, I wasn't aware of the history here. Apparently bug 574688 removed the feature implemented in bug 402278, but only partially? Wonderful!

I don't see any reason to keep this code. http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d1ac428674f2 shows that you already identified all of the unused pieces, I think.
sounds like a relaxing bug to take.

This image is now unused.

This patch makes gDownloadMgr unused as well.
ah good, I thought I searched for gDownloadMgr, probably search failed :/

looks like the string have been added in another push:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e1214959aead
So this is other stuff to check

I couldn't find the original push for the image, looks like has been addes with the new pinstripe in 2008
