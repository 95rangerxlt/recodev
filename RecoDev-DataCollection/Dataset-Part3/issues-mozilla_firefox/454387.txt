I have a folder containing some 5 bookmarks as the first bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar. When I close Firefox and re-open it, the original folder is still there, but there is a duplicate of it placed after my last bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar, complete with 5 bookmarks in it. This happens every time I close and re-open Firefox. I usually delete that duplicate folder, but it always reappears. But I noticed that if I don't delete it, it is not duplicated any further. Firefox seems to think that 2 copies of the folder is enough :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put folder as 1st bookmark in Bookmarks toolbar, preferably containing some bookmarks in it.
2. Close Firefox, then open it again.
3. There should be a duplicate folder after your last bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar.
Actual Results:  
Folder was duplicated.

Expected Results:  
Software should not have duplicated the folder.

This works fine for me. Do you see the same in safe-mode or with a new profile?

can you please check in about:config if importBookmarksHTML is set to true and set it to false if that's the case? please report results here.
I just checked that setting now and it was already false. I also tried setting it to true and then back to false but it makes no difference, the folder is still being duplicated for some reason :(
ans what about safe mode?
Just tried safe mode now, and the problem does not seem to occur in safe mode. I deleted the duplicate folder and started ff in safe mode a few times and the folder was not duplicated. When I started it in normal mode again, the folder was duplicated again.
This is most likely due to an add-on, do you have any bookmarks related add-on, could you try disabling add-ons one by one and test till you find which of them is causing the issue?
You're right, it was the IBM CCK extension that was causing this problem, now everything makes sense. I guess this bug can be closed as it's not a ff bug. Thanks.
ok, thank you, please contact extension author to notify about this issue.

moving bug to extension compatibility
This has been fixed in the IBM CCK.
