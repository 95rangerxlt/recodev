To test it out, clone the pull req. and run ./makexpi.sh to build an xpi.
Adding "dogfood" keyword so this bug shows up on the e10s wiki's list of known issues:

Thank you Yan. Juanb, would you please verify that that the updated addon works with e10s?
I built an xpi from the e10s branch, and I installed it on the latest Nightly on Mac. I have been dogfooding it this morning without any problems. There are redirects to https for sites where available, and, if I specify it in the add-on, sites that do not have https are blocked. I'll continue to dogfooding it, but so far so good.
Should we mark this as fixed then?

No, we should leave this bug open until the stable release of HTTPS Everywhere is e10s-compatible. Currently, neither the 4.0 stable or 5.0 development releases (on https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) are e10s-compatible. I just retested them.
Telemetry data indicates that https everywhere regularly throws 3 different js exceptions.

FILE_NOT_FOUND 0 (probably means attempting to load some file throws)

toolbar_button.js 64

tabbrowser.xml 430
HTTPS-Everywhere 5.0 stable is working on Nightly now.
Jacob from the EFF says HTTPS Everywhere 5.0.0, the stable release, is e10s compatible. Please report any compatibility bugs to the EFF's GitHub issues page: https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues
