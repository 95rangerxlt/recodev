This seems to be a holdover from the early days of Places. There's an ugly (see URL) icon that seems to mean "drop the thing in this folder". It's not really necessary (drag and drop works fine on its own, and dropmarkers show up inside the folders) and the state ends up sometimes sticking.

Anyway, it should be removed.

on winstripe it's referenced here:

on pinstripe it's referenced here:

And for good measure we can take the file out of the manifests and not package it.
gnomestripe lost this in bug 410347.

Be gone!
Why are you removing the rest of the dragover styling?

*sigh*

I removed |-moz-appearance: none|, too, as I think that was used for the image part, but I could be wrong there...
