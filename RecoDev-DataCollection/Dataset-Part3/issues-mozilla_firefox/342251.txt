I forgot about the RTL header images... NSIS uses a rectangular header so the RTL image has to be mirrored.

In my rush I forgot mirroring would change the image. :P This and the ones I will soon attach are done correctly

Whether to flip images for RTL sometimes needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Could you attach a screenshot of the image in context?

I didn't bother with building an RTL to demonstrate this.
For an asymmetric image like the trunk one, the flipped image is aesthetically better, but I don't think it's a big enough deal to be even worth asking the question whether licensing permits doing that.

These should be ok to + for 1.8.1 as it stands without baking on the trunk. All this does is add the images into cvs. Bug 342253 will add the code to use these images.

a=darin on behalf of drivers (please land on the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH and add the fixed1.8.1 keyword to the bug)
Checked in to MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH for Firefox 2.0
Mass-assigning the new rtl keyword to RTL-related (see bug 349193).
