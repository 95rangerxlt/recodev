This is not actually in the default Fennec bookmarks - it must have been synced from a desktop Firefox profile using Firefox Sync.  This patch updates the default Firefox bookmark to use the newer URL.

See bug 537183 for more information/context.

Did you check that other addresses in that file are still fine as of today?

It should be fine, I've not found any test specifically using this uri.

No, I didn't check any other addresses (and I wouldn't know which ones are good).  Maybe abuchanan can double-check http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/generic/profile/bookmarks.html.in for any other problems?
The rest look good to me
