I confirm the exact same behavior, on Windows XP SP2 with Firefox 2.0.0.9, except that the problem is fully reproducible on my machine (and not only "sometimes").

Workaround: click the "older version" link of GMail...
does the same happen in Safe Mode? (http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Safe+Mode)
The problem is indeed absent when using safe mode, thanks. It is probably due to one of the 16 add-ons that I use :-)

With Firefox 3.0 B1 now available, I think I will live with the workaround a few days, then test if the problem is also present in FF 3.0.
You got HtmlValidator installed? Try to block google.com in it (under htmlvalidator options/exceptions)
Yes, I have HtmlValidator. Blocking "google.com" didn't help, unfortunately, GMail still quickly hangs FireFox.
This bug is fixed in newer versions of Firefox (at least now it works very well)

Even with HtmlValidator extension enabled

thank you.
