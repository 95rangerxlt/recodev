Right click on the toolbar or tab area.
"Menu Bar" and "Move to Menu" have the same access key (M)

Is this desirable?

Other similar menu items (open link, close tab and view page source/info) manage to have unique access keys

Egh, actually, I should have read better. This is a separate issue. Dolske? (NB: there won't be a "Menu bar" entry on OS X, but it'll conflict on Windows and Linux...)
Oh, nuts. I guess the simple fix would be to just change the accesskey to "o" for "Move to Menu" and "Move to Toolbar". (Not sure if that needs an entity change for L10N?)

Changed according to comment 3.

I've added a localisation note warning as the problem also affects es-CL and pt-PT.  Do they need follow up bugs?

Land this one instead.

Localisation note now also warns of the potential for clashes with personalbarCmd (Bookmark toolbar), which occurs in the 'it' locale.
