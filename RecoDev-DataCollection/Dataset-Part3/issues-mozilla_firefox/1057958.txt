Darrin, the same way we have play/stop/pause, can we get a "reload" icon? http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/themes/icons.png

Do you want me to try and add it to that sprite? If I follow that format it will break all the coordinates.

Not a problem. Thank you!

Perfect! Thank you so much!!!
Jen, can you take a look at this?

I should involve:

* Updating the sprite map and coordinates for icons
* Changing the play button to switch to the reload icon once the app is already launched / running
"It should involve..."

Thanks for doing this, especially with the sprite sheet.  I know it's annoying to update all the locations... :/

However, I just noticed that the new image seems to have removed the blue phone icon that's used once the runtime in connected.  So, we'll need Shorlander to put that back first.
Shorlander, please restore the blue phone icon in the new sprite sheet.

Oops, sorry about that.

With a small change like this after you've already gotten r+, it's good practice to "carry over" the r+ and set it yourself on the new patch.

This way, the sheriffs who land things when you set "checkin-needed" can be sure there was a review at some point.

Shouldn't this be uplifted to Firefox 34 beta so that there are no ambiguous messages when one accidentally wants to add the same app twice?
Petruta, I'm not sure if it's too late for that or not.  

Jen, do you want to nominate this for uplift to 34, or maybe 35?
I don't see why not if it's not too late.
As this is mainly a usability improvement and not a regression or bug fix, it seems more appropriate to let it ride the trains.

It landed with 35, so it's already there in Dev. Edition.  I think that's good enough.

If others feel more strongly though, feel free to request beta uplift. :)
Oops. Not sure what I was smoking this morning but yeah it's on 35 already. :)  Good enough!
