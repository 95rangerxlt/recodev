The chat window gets the "glass" theme on Windows but the title-bar can't be dragged, meaning there is no way for the user to reposition it.

Could have sworn I already closed this!  Fixed in d87296e45a98c35b2bbb26161f9382bf22f00dc9
I'm not entirely certain what use case this refers to. I certainly cannot open a chat from the sidebar and drag the chat widget title to move it.
This bug initially referred to when the chat window was itself a top-level window.  Now they are "embedded" in the window they again aren't movable - but let's track that in bug 791092.
Okay, thanks Mark. Flagging [qa-] as there doesn't seem to be anything to verify here.
