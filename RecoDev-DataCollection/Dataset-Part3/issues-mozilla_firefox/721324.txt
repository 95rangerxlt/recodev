The source editor (orion) currently only includes 'chrome://browser/content/orion-mozilla.css'. This means that third party themes, such as Walnut and Nautipolis cannot style the style editor nor scratchpad.

Please add a way to include a 'chrome://browser/skin/orion-mozilla.css'.
Possibly with the default theme with an import to the content version.
@import "chrome://browser/content/orion-mozilla.css"

Sounds like a good idea! Thanks Alfred!

Hello VD! Thanks for your interest to help us with this bug! I am glad to help you make the Source Editor themeable.

We have taken the discussion to IRC and VD is already working on a patch! Looking forward to his patch!

Path looks good. Thank you very much for your contribution VD! Awesome!

Dão: should we keep the content stylesheet? I think we can work only with the theme CSS.

Please remove any empty rules.

Please use 'hg copy' to move the mozilla.css contents to the new files (before modifying mozilla.css).

nit: indentation is off.

Please name the new files orion.css rather than orion-mozilla.css.

I expected 'hg copy' to create this file based on browser/devtools/sourceeditor/orion/mozilla.css rather than /dev/null. Did this not work?
Hi! I had initially done a hg add and then removed those files and did a hg copy of mozilla.css. Not sure why its still /dev/null!

Patch looks good for me! Thanks VD for your work and sorry for all the trouble!

Dão: the hg copy trick does not seem to do what we would expect - could be because the copy happens to three locations. Can you please r+ this patch from our contributor? I appreciate his work and I believe that this patch should land, unless there are other problems with it. Thank you!

[in-fx-team] minor update

VD: I removed orion-mozilla.css entirely from browser/devtools - not much point in keeping it.

. and I landed your patch! See:
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/e31fff76aeff

Thank you very much for your contribution! Much appreciated! Keep up the good work!

Please document the new themeable Source Editor (Orion) CSS files in Firefox 13. Thank you!
