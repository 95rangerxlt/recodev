See the url. Press PgDn twice and a part at the bottom (under position:fixed div's) isn't redrawn. Then press PgUp twice and a part at the top (again under position:fixed divs) is not redrawn. Works in FF2.004. This can also be triggered using the scroll wheel.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Parts of the page after scrolling are not redrawn.

Expected Results:  
All parts coming in view should be drawn.

I can't reproduce anymore with Minefield/3.0a7pre 2007070304, guess it's fixed by the patch in bug 385222.
