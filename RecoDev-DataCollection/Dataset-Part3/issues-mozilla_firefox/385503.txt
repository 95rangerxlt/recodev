'Set Desktop Background' on an image large than screen and position=center preview is too large.

Browse to very large image (see URL above) (larger than your screen size), and select 'Set As Desktop Background' and select 'center' in position. The monitor and the image itself then becomes much larger than the window.

Probably caused by bug 362239.

Clip the image when it is larger than screensize

overflow:hidden and using negative margins places the image in the right position.

V2: Get the signs right so that it works in all cases
If #monitor needs overflow:hidden (in bug 362239, I wasn't sure why that existed) and an explicit width/height, why not move that to the style sheet? (In return, you can remove the right and bottom margins.)

The margins for the image shouldn't be needed, given that they weren't there before bug 362239 was fixed.
I have a stylesheet-only fix for this (the regression from bug 362239, that is). Do you want me to create a patch?

Your negative margins actually fix another bug, which is also present in Firefox 2.

Do we want to split this into two bugs?

Ok, since I caused the regression, I'll just do it.

Alfred, I think you're on track with your negative margins. I think fixing the centering deserves a separate bug though.

patch

r=mano, untested though.
I did test the Winstripe part, can't test Pinstripe. The monitor images have the same "screen" size (i.e. 153 x 114 px), so it shouldn't make a difference.

Alfred, one final note: If you file a bug for the centering fix, please CC me (if you don't, I might file one later on.)
Checked in attachmentt 269523.

Litmus Triage Team: tomcat will add the test case for this one.
Litmus Triage Team: stephend will handle this test case.
If we want a Litmus test case for this we need a new sample since the URL now gives a 404 error. Thanks.
Marcia, you just need to use an image that's larger than your monitor's resolution. An image that's larger than 2560x1600 (the resolution of a 30" monitor) would probably work since not many people are going to be running resolutions larger than that. For example: http://flickr.com/photos/johnath/2724738037/sizes/o/.
