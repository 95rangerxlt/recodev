New certificates (one active and one standby) for aus will be acquired in Bug 583678 and the new certificates will be for a new host name (possibly aus3.mozilla.org). After the new host name is added with the certificate the app.update.url preference will need to be changed to the new host name and the existing app.update.certs.* preference will need to be modified and the standby cert added. The cert preferences were added in bug 544442.

Nick, just a heads up.
cc'ing Daniel to give him a heads up as well
Why is a hostname needed for this?
*new hostname, that is.
By adding a new hostname with the new certs the change can be implemented immediately without having to add the existing cert to the prefs and waiting for the beta 3 or nightly users to upgrade to the next beta or nightly since aus2 will still be available with the previous cert.
Why not just get two new certs for aus2.m.o? The current cert is just the normal wildcard cert, no? Just not seeing why the change in hostname is needed, especially since we currently don't do any cert checking on AUS, afaik...
We do cert attribute checking on the client side - see bug 544442 - so, we wouldn't be able to deploy the new cert until after everyone has upgraded.

Ah! I didn't know that had landed yet. Ok, this makes more sense now. :)
