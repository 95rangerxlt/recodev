Just use the am. link and play arround with the window size.

The three depicted images have a floating height and width definition. Depending on the windows size there may be a one pixel border to the right or at the bottom. Never at the top or to the left. The color of the border matches the css-defined background color(s). 

As FF 3.0, Opera, Safari and Chrome don't show this behaviour it has to be introduced with 3.5.

P.S.: I will delete the server files approx. one month from now. So pls. download them if it is necessary.

Reproducible: Always

As noby has even found the time to confirm the bug, I have deleted the example files and will adjust the status to resolved & fixed.
