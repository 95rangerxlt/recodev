Dave, given the last update, did you want to take a look at this too?
Comment on attachment 757493
Update pdf.js to version 0.8.219

Looks ok to me, but doesn't seem to include the fixed from bug 871530 comment 7.
Which bugs in bugzilla.mozilla.org are fixed?
Currently 299 unsolved "Component: PDF Viewer" bugs here.
Check the upstream bug number in the whiteboard or the description in the upstream PR. If you couldn't find the bug number, retest with the patched build and close with WORKSFORME if fixed (unless you want to bisect the PDF.js repo).
And a few more updates:
#3326 Simplify getting the pdf url.
#3315 Disable range request loading for safari.
#3334 Fix check for instanceof Uint8Array in IE9
#3289 Load all resources before getOperatorList/getTextContent.
#3339 Properly disables presentation mode
