This is the FB version of part 1 of bug 221484.

For each autocomplete search, FB creates an nsVoidArray, fills it, then copies 
that into an nsIMdbRow** array, sorts it, and then copies each element one at a 
time into nsIAutoCompleteMdbResult with AddRow.

FB should instead use an nsCOMArray.Sort(); this will get us better typesafety 
and remove one array build/copy round.
