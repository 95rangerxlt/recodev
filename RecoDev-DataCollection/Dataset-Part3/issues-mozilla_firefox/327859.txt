I believe this regressed between this build: http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/2005-12-02-06-trunk/ which doesn't crash and this build: http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/2005-12-03-06-trunk/ which does crash.

Thanks you for Windoze :-(
After a system reboot I wasn't able to crash anymore
But what was Windows doing?  Is there some error that the browser isn't handling correctly?
This bug really sucks.
After a few hours of browsing the same crash happened again twice and I have no idea why (I didn't use the testcase to crash)
Martijn, any change you could crash this one with a debug build, the current trace looks pretty useless

I really haven't seen anything out of the ordinary in windows David.
Somehow it requires some browsing before this can happen, and if it does it's reproducable 100% with the testcase.

Sorry, I can't reproduce this bug. 


This appears to have been fixed by bug 327655
I have not experienced any crashes since the 20060222 nightly
So marking WFM then?

Let me wait for the trace from TB15578362M which happened in a cairo build.
If that one isn't this I'll resolve this bug.
