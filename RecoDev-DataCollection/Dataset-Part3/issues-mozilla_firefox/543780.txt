choosing a "monospaced" font in the Options dialog

When the list of available fonts is presented in the Firefox prefs dialog, the function GDIFontEntry::MatchesGenericFamily() is used to determine if fonts match the CSS generics such as "serif", "sans-serif", or "monospace". This is done using the "windows family" property of the fonts.

In the Prefs dialog, this is used to sort "matching" fonts into the first section of the font list, and the remaining families appear in a second section of the list.

However, many fonts do not provide the proper metadata for Windows to classify them in this way, but are simply marked as FF_DONTCARE. This is especially true for non-Latin fonts, but also for many third-party Latin fonts. The result is that these fonts appear in the first (preferred) section of the list even when this is not appropriate; moreover, they appear in the first section of the list for ALL the generics (serif, sans, and monospace).

The attached screenshot shows the font list being used to select a "monospace" font; note that the list mixes many non-monospaced fonts in with the valid monospaced ones, so that the user is given little help in making an appropriate choice.

font list on the same system with FF_DONTCARE fonts excluded

Rather than treating FF_DONTCARE as matching all generics, it would be better to treat it as matching none of them. This way, only those fonts with a specific family classification will be "promoted" to the first section of the font list, making it much more useful as a way to find appropriate fonts. The others will still be available from the latter part of the list.

This second screenshot shows the same font dialog with this change to the internal behavior; note how the first section of the font list now contains a much more useful subset of the available fonts.

John, curious whether you think this is a good change - and does it behave OK in the Japanese locale?
