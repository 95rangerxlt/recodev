We should replace the two instances of string.indexOf in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-view.js with string.contains.

The usages are at:
> http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-view.js#384
> http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-view.js#398

See http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:string_extras for documentation on the new String.contains method.

Can you attach the diff of your changes instead of the updated file please?

Patch for bug 788229

Review of attachment 659755:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The changes to debugger-view.js look fine, but this patch removes 4 tests from the source tree that shouldn't be removed.

Tip: If you are using a Mercurial Queues patch file, you can apply the patch (hg qpush --move patchName), then refresh only the file that you want to keep (hg qref /path/to/debugger-view.js). This will now keep only the debugger-view.js changes in the patch. The other files will still have their changes but won't be part of the patch file. You can now revert the changes to the test files (hg revert --all). After running this last command, your tree will be back to a healthy state and your patch file will only contain the changes to debugger-view.js.

This looks good to me.

Please update your Mercurial [ui] username field to include your email address. When you have done it successfully, it should look like:
username = Abraa <address@example.com>

Tip: Please don't set the checkin flag when requesting review. This flag is only used for multipart patches that have already been granted review but need to land at separate times.

This is backwards. indexOf(...) == -1 means the string does /not/ contain the sub string.
Doh! Sorry, thank you for catching that Dao.

Change String.indexOf to String.contains in debugger-view.js

That was a silly mistake last time. Everything should be correct now.
Matt, have you run the tests with this patch applied?

No I have not yet. I will look into that.
I ran the mochitest-browser-chrome and their was no errors
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/b56ba10aea13
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b56ba10aea13
while I'm ok with this bug, in the future please ask a devtools peer for review before landing code.
