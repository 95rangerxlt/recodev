Use the child selector.

>+#social-provider-image:-moz-focusring > .button-box {
>+  border: none;
>+}

Why is this button focusable? Keyboard access?
Taking this as requested.
(easier to track this in the social component, since we're going to need to keep track of the bugs that we need to uplift)

WIP Patch

This gets it close, but the borders on the [open=true] state aren't completely matching the :active state of other buttons on the toolbar yet.

There is potentially a lot of cleanup in the CSS for the social toolbar button but I don't want to include it all for this bug.

Patch

This patch cleans up some of the CSS and gets the button to match the other Australis toolbar buttons in terms of styling.

Patch v1.1

I noticed that the border-width was being increased in the "open" state, so I moved it to apply to all states of the button with a default "transparent" border-color.

Patch v1.2

Sorry for the multiple patches, this one moves the border-radius to apply for all states and fixes the values being used in the :hover state.

Patch v1.2

>diff --git a/browser/themes/winstripe/browser.css b/browser/themes/winstripe/browser.css

>+#social-toolbar-button[open="true"] > .social-statusarea-container {

>+  box-shadow: 0 1px 1px hsla(210,54%,20%,.1) inset,
>+              0 0 1px hsla(210,54%,20%,.2) inset,
>+              /* allows winstripe-keyhole-forward-clip-path to be used for non-hover as well as hover: */

This comment seems unlikely to be relevant here?

> #social-statusarea-user {

>+  background-color: -moz-Dialog;
>+  color: black;

-moz-dialogtext?

>+  cursor: default;

Unnecessary.

Patch v1.3

Thanks for the feedback Gavin, I've addressed the issues you found.

I also removed the cursor:pointer that was set on the #social-notification-icon-container since our toolbar buttons don't usually have cursor:pointer;

Patch v1.3

r=me with the change we discussed on IRC (remove the extra two lines from the box-shadow style on #social-toolbar-button[open="true"] > .social-statusarea-container).
