In Bug 339185 we changed the installer to always install talkback and only enable it for a percentage of basic installs. To verify the code worked as it should we set the percentage to 75% for nightly builds. We should set it back to 100% so we acquire more talkback data from the nightly user community.

patch - set talkback percentage to 100% for nightly builds
Is this firefox only? Or maybe the question should be if this can also be applied to Seamonkey, Thunderbird, and Sunbird?

Thanks.
it is Firefox only... Thunderbird and Sunbird are already set to 100%... Seamonkey doesn't use the NSIS installer yet which provides this capability.
Checked in to trunk
