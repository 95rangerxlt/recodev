I'm working on it. Meanwhile a ff3 b2 compatible version is at http://www.thestasis.com/?q=colorfultabs. It's a beta.

re,
varun21
A ff3 b2 and b3 compatible version has been made available at AMO https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1368.

re,
cool!  thanks vaurn.  marking fixed for now and we can run though and check all the "fixed" bugs for the final version update.
Hmm, I see on your website that the version works with Fx3... however the forums and the maxVer on AMO are indicating that it is not compatible. Any idea what happened?
just checking in again. Any plans to update to 3.0pre?
I'm working on a ff 3.0pre version. May take a few days.
Varun - 3.0.* is available on AMO now. If you get an update ready -- we can make sure all the Firefox 3 users get it!

Let me know if you need any help!

Big troubles on Linux version! Very ugly appearence, much worst than FF2.
Varun, from your website I see that you're fully aware of the upcoming release. Any chance you can add your builds to AMO? RC3 (which is pretty much RC2), will become Firefox 3 if all goes to plan.
I'm on top of it. I was just planning time for this over the weekend. But now it will have to be sooner. Will start testing today.
ColorfulTabs 3.1 is compatible with Firefox 3 RC3 and has been made available at AMO. Users may please download it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1368 or http://binaryturf.com/software/colorfultabs-for-firefox/
Enjoy Firefox 3 release with ColorfulTabs.
Varun, thank you so much! This is wonderful.
