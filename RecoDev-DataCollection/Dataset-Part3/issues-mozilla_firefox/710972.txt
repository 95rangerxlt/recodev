Steps to reproduce:

I get build failure with trunk on Linux x86_64:

I backed out bug 682832 then I was able to get a clean build.

I'm not sure if it's related, but I use these two switches --enable-gio and --disable-gnomevfs.  Also I'm building for gnome2.

G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING_ARRAY is apparently new to glib 2.26. You're probably building against an older version of glib. I got the same problem on Debian squeeze, which comes with glib 2.24.

Define G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING_ARRAY when building against older glib

This should do the right thing.

Better without the spurious change in makemakefile.pm

Regression caused by bug #682832
Firefox 11 fails to build on older Linux distros when building with --enable-gio (which, it should be noted, is not the default)
Requesting per mail request from akeybl, but i don't believe this is important enough (that is, it is probably an edge case).

My only concern was that this would unnecessarily cause issues for Linux distros building Firefox 11 post-release. If that's not the case (and this is just an edge case), then there's no need to take on Beta 11.
