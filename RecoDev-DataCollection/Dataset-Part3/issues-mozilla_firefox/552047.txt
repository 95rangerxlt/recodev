When dragging an item to the tab bat, the drop indicator is displayed between tabs even when the item would be loaded in an existing tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag a link to the tab bar on top of the middle of a tab, and hold mouse down.
Actual Results:  
The tab drop indicator will be displayed on the left side of the tab if the cursor is on the left half of the tab or on the right side of the tab if the cursor is on the right half of the tab.

Expected Results:  
When the cursor in the middle third of the tab (horizontally), the tab drop indicator should be displayed on top of the tab itself.

See Google Chrome for a consistent UI implementation of this. Make sure that the tab drop indicator actually matches where the item will be loaded. This should be part of the Firefox 4 UI refresh.

The User-Agent above is Chrome, because I was testing how the UI works in Chrome when filing this :P
Lets ask our ux team.
yep, this is a flaw.  The item should turn into a new tab as soon as it enters the tab strip, and from there behave similar to a tab reordering operation until upclick.

If that's the case, this should depend on bug 455694.
