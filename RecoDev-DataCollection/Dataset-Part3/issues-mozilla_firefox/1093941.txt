[browser_urlbarAutoFillTrimURLs.js]

Waits indefinitely for onSearchComplete. Not sure why that isn't fired.

[browser_urlbarEnter.js]

The comment says this crashed on try. It might not anymore?

[browser_urlbarRevert.js]

Fails with: ESC reverted the location bar value - Got foobar, expected example.com

Presumably this has to do with synthesizeKey not working right? Maybe? It's a little odd though, because this is all parent process...

[browser_urlbarStop.js]
The test calls gBrowser.contentWindow.stop(), which doesn't work. I don't know why our shimming doesn't cover this; perhaps there are other ways of doing this that already work?

Otherwise, this will require a small bit of messaging. See e.g. http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/general/browser_save_video_frame.js#49 for an idea on how to do this.


Requesting tracking-e10s because I think esp. what with unifiedcomplete, we should make doubly sure that our location bar works correctly under e10s as well.

e10s test bugs block e10s, but not a particular milestone.

This single test will be fixed by bug 1100291. We'll have to rewrite it properly anyway and that will make it e10s compatible too.

There are only 2 tests that remain disabled for this bug. browser_urlbarAutoFillTrimURLs.js seems to work fine while browser_urlbarEnter.js needed a little love  - the first change should be obvious from the comment, while the second change is more subtle - waiting for the "load" event of gBrowser.selectedBrowser was actually waiting for the load of the *initial* tab (ie, .selectedBrowser hasn't been updated by the time that is called) - that load event never came due to the promiseTabLoaded meaning it already fired.

Nit: Could as well use BrowserTestUtils.browserLoaded().
