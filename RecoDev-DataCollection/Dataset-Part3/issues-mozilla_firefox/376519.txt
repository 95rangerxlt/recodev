testcase

See testcase, with the testcase you get with right-clicking a js exception in the error console, and you see all possible options in the context menu:
Error: uncaught exception: Empty href

The error is here:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js#941
It doesn't seem logical that Firefox throws here, does it?

patch v1

onLink should not be true in nsContextMenu when we are on an area tag without href value.

I assume that line was a copy/paste mistake in bug 266932:
(parent instanceof HTMLAnchorElement && elem.href)
