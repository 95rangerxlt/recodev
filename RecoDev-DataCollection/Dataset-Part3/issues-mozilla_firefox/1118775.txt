Given the current plan to implement Heartbeat on a 'tour' privileged thing, the Self-Support url will have to also be viewd by tour as privileged (or we can add a second pref for browser.repair.*).  

Not sure the right solution.

All of this is a temp hack, so choose a poison :)

This is done, at the moment, by granting the SelfSupport URL "uitour" privileges when loading the page in bug 1111022!
We can add the necessary domain to http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/default_permissions?force=1

This is the correct solution to prevent the permission from getting cleared by Clear Recent History.
(it's also unclear to me how to get localhost:8000 or such to get uitour permissions, for dev and testing.  Not sure if this a new bug or not.  Benjamin, ideas?)

tried:

```
let addPerm = function (uri) {
  console.log("ADDING:", uri);
  let pageURI = Services.io.newURI(uri, null, null);
  Services.perms.add(pageURI, "uitour", Services.perms.ALLOW_ACTION);
  let good = Services.perms.testPermission(pageURI, "uitour") ===  Services.perms.ALLOW_ACTION;
  console.log("ADDED:", uri, good);
};

addPerm("http://localhost/");
addPerm("http://localhost:8000");
addPerm("http://127.0.0.1:8000");
```

The perm manager tests 'true' for those same strings, but at localhost the object doesn't work correctly.  At other pages it does.
I don't know. Similar things have worked in the past for me, but rather than using "localhost" I've used internal computer names like "stravinsky". Maybe localhost is special somehow.
The problem is likely that we don't allow http unless you set browser.uitour.requireSecure = false.
Similarly, you can use the browser.uitour.testingOrigins pref to whitelist a domain for testing/dev (it's used as a comma separated list; no restart needed).
Blair, MattN, thanks for the suggestions here. I think once we have the url, it should all fall into place just fine!
