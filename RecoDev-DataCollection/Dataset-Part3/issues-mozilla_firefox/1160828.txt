Only seems to occur when importing a profile when first opening the tool (when markers have never been rendered yet). Think it's something to do with the graph changes that handles feature detection (the imported profile that causes this does indeed have the correct configuration set).

Emitted by Graphs.jsm, doesn't cause any failures and everything seems to work OK, just a race condition I suspect.

Possibly maybe the source of some race conditions elsewhere causing intermittents.
