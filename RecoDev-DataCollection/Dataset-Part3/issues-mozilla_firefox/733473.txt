in-content landing page

This patch creates the skeleton pre-processing file, landing page, and modifies the makefile(s) to add the in-content directory in the preferences folder. I did not modify the HTML5 history because of our discussion about using the search functionality to do the navigation.

Fixed the css issues. I am not sure about the display:block feedback since that style is being applied to the hbox, not the header. If I do remove it then the icons don't wrap to a new line properly...

I don't see anything I'd put in inContent.css (minus what bug 660726 will do). The in-content.css file here should really just be called preferences.css, and moved to the different themes.

Still waiting for various (most?) things to be fixed up from my review at bug 723328 comment 17.

Also, could you fix the indentation of, uh, everything? It sounds trivial but it makes it harder to read, and no patch will land without that fixed (and it's frustrating commenting on it every time). For example, landing.xul uses 4-space indent instead of 2-space; landing.xul and preferences.xul wrap lines by the second line doesn't line up (attribute should line up with the first attribute on the first line); landing.xul has 2 whitespace lines instead of 1.

This isn't used here, but it'll be used by other JS files for the various preferences. Which no doubt will also use Cc (Components.classes), Cu (Components.utils), and Cr (Components.results) - so you should define those here too (so they're not needed in the other files).

Also, before this line, add the following line:

That will opt-in to strict mode. We're trying to do that for all new JS files. Don't worry about doing that in the other bugs though, as it will most likely require a bunch of other changes in those files.

Use window.title instead of "Preferences" (as a bonus, it's already localized for you). Same with other uses of that string in this file.

  window.history.pushState(page, "Preferences");

Er, sorry, preferences.xul does indeed use the preprocessor - you need the * for that file.

Also, that file needs a newline at the end (in case that wasn't obvious).

I have no idea why the default style (:-moz-any-link) isn't applying here, to give the pointer cursor. Unless someone else has an idea, we can just leave in that style (but don't use the .inline-link class). In which case, you should file a separate bug to fix that properly - and mention that in a comment in the CSS file.

You don't need to set the border, background, and box-shadow properties to none in gnomestripe (they don't have any affect in this case, because buttons are styled based on the system theme by default).

To make sure this works for all links, you should select based on the tag (instead of adding a class):

html:a { }

And you'll need to add the following to the top of the CSS file:

@namespace html "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml";

Same with this comment.

Also, these styles are copied from the wrong theme (winstripe, rather than gnomestripe). gnomestripe (the Linux theme) uses system icons, and doesn't alter the appearance of the buttons.
You'll need to use the styles from:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/gnomestripe/mozapps/extensions/extensions.css#273

Again, these styles seem to be copied from winstripe, not pinstripe.
See https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/themes/pinstripe/mozapps/extensions/extensions.css

Not all of the relevant styles were copied, so the pressed (active) state is missing, and the disabled state doesn't look very disabled.

The only thing that differs between this style and .landingButton-icon is the margin - merge the common properties into one style. Same applies to pinstripe and winstripe.

I keep forgetting to ask: Why did you give this a value of 50px? It's overriding an existing style that sets it to 23px.

We should set document.documentElement.instantApply = true here (or as an attribute on the <page> element if that would work) so that the in-content preferences aren't dependent on the about:config pref being true.
