OSX + Dark LWT: The newtab icon and "list all tabs dropdown" icons are not visible. See right side of tabstrip:

Panorama and the native fullscreen-window control have the same issue.

(Also, what's up with the system menubar in that screenshot?)

That seemed to happen recently around the time I was automating the screenshots. I just restarted the computer so we'll see if it comes back.  My guess would be an OS X bug related to going into and out of Lion fullscreen repeatedly.
Not taking this for M7. Is this not an issue on current nightly?
AFAICT this needs inverted icons (newtab-inverted.png; newtab-inverted@2x.png) on OS X, which we do seem to have on Windows but not OS X? Needinfo'ing Stephen to confirm and get us icons for this... :-)
(ditto for alltabs-box-bkgnd-icon[-lion[@2px]].png and tab-arrow-(left|right)[@2x].png )

OS X tabstrip icons should have inverted versions for dark LWTs,

I don't even like black themes, but I have to say, this looks pretty slick. :-)

r+ assuming alltabs-box-bkgnd-icon-inverted* looks fine on all supported OS X versions. Sorry for the delay.

Was it decided to use the same inverted icon on the lions and Snow Leopard? You mention the lion files in comment 4 but I don't see a confirmation on the bug that the omission was intentional. Can you double-check with Stephen? It's probably fine since we don't have other lion-specific inverted images in this file.

Nit: move the "-left" above the "-right" so the left are all together.

There isn't actually a separate lion Toolbar.png image anymore. There's just one. See:

Some part of me thinks we may want to unify this to only use the lion imagery everywhere for consistency (ie, get rid of the '-lion' part of all filenames, remove all the lion specific includes etc.). But that'd be a separate bug.

Anyway, needinfo'ing for the question of what we want to do here and/or for the general case, just to confirm... Stephen, can you clarify your intentions? :-)
I clarified the Lion question with Stephen over IRC, we're good to go here when the tree is green.
