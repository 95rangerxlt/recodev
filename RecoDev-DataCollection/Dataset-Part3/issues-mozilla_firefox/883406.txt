As seen in the Browser Console while running UX Nightly:

Is this still reproducable?
Yes, this is still reproducible. To reproduce:

1. open Firefox
2. open the Browser Console.
3. type "local" in the Filter area to make it easier to see these errors.
4. open the Panel UI
5. see two errors about privatebrowsing-button and history-panelmenu.
6. enter customization mode
7. see an error about feed-button
I'm assuming this breaks something with L10N --> P1.

No, actually... it's just our code which is expecting shortcuts for all the widgets, which is probably wrong, especially as we don't really use them yet (that's being discussed in bug 887853). As in, these l10n props are completely separate from the actual shortcuts. This is easily fixable separately, though. Taking.

Shouldn't throw errors for missing shortcuts

This does the trick, and is, IMHO, the right fix for this specific issue.

I'm not really fond of passing an arbitrary string to `getLocalizedProperty`, but I can't think of a better solution.

If "none" seems arbitrary, we could also make it not ERROR() if you explicitly pass the empty string (rather than it defaulting to the empty string because you didn't pass anything.

Do you think that's a better solution?

Yes! You don't need to pass "none" or "", which means you can also strip passing the 'null' arg.

So only `if (!def) {}` would be sufficient I think...
As per discussion on IRC, pushed with the "none" solution.
