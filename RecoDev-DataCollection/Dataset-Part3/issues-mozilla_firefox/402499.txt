Steps to reproduce:
1. Focus a link.
2. Cmd+D (open the "add bookmark" panel).
3. Esc (close the "add bookmark" panel).

Result: focus is now on the page as a whole instead of on the link.

I'm guessing that fixing bug 395670 is the most sane way to fix this.

Fix checked in with bug 407359.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
