There are a few NS_IMPL_SUPPORTS and a NS_GENERIC_FACTORY_CONSTRUCTOR introduced by places that have a trailing semi-colon. GCC 4.0 reports an error on these. I couldn't find a bug on this. Patch coming.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put --enable-places in mozconfig
2. compile
3.

Actual Results:  
doesn't build

Expected Results:  
builds

checked in, thanks.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
