Bug 122951 improved the markup of MPL-1.1.html. We need to update
mozilla/xpfe/global/resources/content/MPL-1.1.html and
mozilla/toolkit/content/MPL-1.1.html as well.

I attached a patch in that bug: attachment 167549.

Sounds good to me, assuming the patch is just a file copy, and you've checked
that the original files were also pretty identical.

Check it in when the tree opens.

The patch is of course just a file copy. The original files are pretty
identical, except that the xpfe version is from 2002-01-15 15:40, and the
toolkit version is a copy of that, and both don't contain the changes you made
since (rev. 1.4 and 1.5).
