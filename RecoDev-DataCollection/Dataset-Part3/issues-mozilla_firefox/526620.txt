Resizing window to a small size -> taskbar preview small -> Restore window -> taskbar preview still small until hoverd over.

STR:
1) Load any page in at least two tabs
2) Resize the window so that about 15 pixels are showing
3) Look at taskbar preview and notice a few pixels of the preview are shown
4) Restore the window to the maximized size
5) Look at the preview and notice the taskbar preview is still small until you hover over the preview
