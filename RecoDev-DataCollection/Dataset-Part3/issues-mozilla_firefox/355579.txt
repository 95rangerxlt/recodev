This works just fine if you turn it on with NTT. All that needs to be done
AFIAK is that the maxver needs updating.
Seems the CSSViewer has been upgraded to FF2.0 compatibility (see https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2104/).  Tried to assign this bug to myself in order to set status to FIXED, but seems I can't do that.  Therefore, I'll only drop a note here to inform you that the extension is compatible with a vanilla-install of FF2.0.  There is one minor JS error, but it works nonetheless.
