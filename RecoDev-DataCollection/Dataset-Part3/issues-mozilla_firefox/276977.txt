WFM, no crash in Firefox 20050103 and Mozilla 2005010206 trunk builds on Linux.
(Firefox 1.0 on Linux crashes though.)
I'm running 1.0 by the way, like most people.

Reporter's testcase

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050408
Firefox/1.0+

WFM on latest-trunk, I get no crash, or anything really. Appears to display a
single word, 'test', on the upper left hand corner of the page, and doesn't
appear to have any sort of issues.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050407
Firefox/1.0+

What it does is this: prints 'test', but I have the "working in background"
cursor.  I can click and do things in it and the working in background stays,
unless I switch tabs.  When I switch back, back to 'working in background'.

Status bar reads "Done."

That looks like a seperate issue from what this bug was filed for.  Need to file
another bug for that issue, or find one already filed?
