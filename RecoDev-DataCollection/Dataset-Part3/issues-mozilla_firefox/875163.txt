HUEG SCREENSHOT

Screenshot attached. The New Window and Print icons are the correct size.

I suspect this rule, added by bug 866863, just needs to set the default icon size (or a similar rule outside the hidpi block, since the dimensions are the same either way)...

browser/themes/osx/customizableui/panelUIOverlay.css

+@media (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
+  #PanelUI-contents[type="grid"] toolbarbutton,
+  #customization-palette toolbarbutton {
+    list-style-image: url(chrome://browser/skin/customizableui/menuPanel-icons@2x.png);
+  }
+
+  #PanelUI-popup .panel-combined-button {
+    list-style-image: url(chrome://browser/skin/customizableui/menuPanel-small-icons@2x.png);
+  }

Look... it was said that we should have a touch friendly UI. You got a touch friendly UI. What more could we give you! Gosh!

I am unclear on why we're using something else than Toolbar.png... we now have buttons using Toolbar.png and using the new sprites, which leads to all kinds of craziness. For instance, if the bookmarks and history buttons are in the customization palette they have no icon at all... Are we waiting until we have final assets and small copies of all the icons in order to do that?

This patch fixes the hugeness, and uses the @x2 images for the combined buttons in customization mode, too (right now you can see them visually degrading if you go into customization mode...).

Ideally, I believe we want to merge all the new buttons into the primaryToolbarButton define in shared/browser.inc, but for that to work properly they need to share the same sprite, I suspect - I tried doing it to fix this bug and that led to icons disappearing for buttons in the customization palette. :-\

As Stephen mentioned earlier, the reason we're splitting out from Toolbar.png is because of the higher maintenance cost of having icons with different dimensions in the same spritesheet.

So there's no plans at this point to toss them into Toolbar.png.

The code looks fine, but I don't have a Retina Macbook to test this with. I'll spin up a build and see if somebody is willing to be my guinea pig.

According to some Retina-using folks, this patch makes everything jake.

Since Gijs isn't going to be here until Tuesday, I'll land this for him.
