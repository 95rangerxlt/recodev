If the media has multiple media objects, only the first is shown (despite the heading "Media Files"):


		<media:content url="http://a.wordpress.com/avatar/wattsupwiththat-128.jpg" medium="image">
			<media:title type="html">wattsupwiththat</media:title>

		</media:content>

			<media:title type="html">hp_filter_equation.png</media:title>
		</media:content>



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  See details.



Expected Results:  
I expected to see all media objects for each item, just not the first one.

Looks untested in the parser: I see tests for what happens with one media:content and one enclosure, and for what happens with two media:contents in a media:group, but not two ungrouped media:contents. Of course, the preview is untested too, and may well be at fault, but the parser doesn't get to rest on its tested laurels.
I wrote it that way because I thought you could only have one media:content tag in an item unless it was enclosed in a media:group in order to maintain "one item for each thing" in the RSS feed.

Re-reading the spec suggests that this isn't a strict restriction, but instead a suggested restriction.  Sorry about that.

This is definitely a FeedProcessor parser fix and it's not hard to do.  I can probably fix this--but it's going to take me a few days to get to.
It's actually not even a general suggestion: if your goal is to publish the audio or video ("I have a video, I want people to watch it"), then it's a suggestion to have an item per media-thing, but if your goal is to publish items ("I want to write about something, about which I have a video and three songs"), then multiples are expected, and ducking the unanswerable question of whether or not more than one enclosure is allowed per item is the prime benefit of using media:content instead.
I'm not sure I really follow....

Are you suggesting I need to revise the planned fix or are you just talking about the specification and expanding upon what I just said or some third thing?
Agreeing with your conclusion ("we should show the content from multiple media:content elements when they aren't in a media:group"), disagreeing with "a suggested restriction" - it's only suggested in one particular case, and whether something's in that case is a matter of how the publisher feels about it, so as feed consumer the suggestion doesn't matter to us at all.

I wouldn't have muddied the waters at all, except that I've seen drivers decide whether or not to take a fix based on not fully understanding a couple of words casually used just like "suggested restriction" so I wanted to make it clear that feeds like the one in the URL field are absolutely 100% correct, and fully spec-compliant.
Will, a fix would be great (especially if we can get it before Tuesday next) and adding reftests would be better sauce for the goose!

Removes restriction of one media:content per item.

This patch removes the restriction, fixes the mrss_content test case, and adds a test case specifically for testing multiple media:content per item.
Phil: I appreciate you clarifying.  Re-reading what I wrote and looking over all the other silly things I did today makes me wonder if someone switched my coffee with mud when I wasn't looking.

I miss hacking on Firefox.  I'll keep tabs on this and make sure it gets fixed up and landed before next tuesday.
