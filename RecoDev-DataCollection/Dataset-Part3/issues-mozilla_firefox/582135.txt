[checked-in] Proposed patch.

The Web Console filter box should be on the right, which both helps the "balance" of the design and matches the OS placement of search boxes on Windows and Mac.

This is a small, but important UI tweak to the Console, so I'm requesting approval for Firefox 4.

Requiring that we keep a reference to the DOM elements we're creating in makeHUDNodes so that makeFilterToolbar can append them is kind of silly. Can you refactor so that they're appended in makeHUDNodes instead, so that this can just use a local variable? You could even just inline makeFilterToolbar, since it only has the one caller...

(I wonder why we're dynamically creating the DOM here at all? I suppose it's because this component was designed to be app-agnostic? Even if we don't fix bug 579909, I wonder whether dynamically DOMParsing a static XUL file and inserting it into the document in one shot would be more efficient...)

I tried to create a console ui in markup a couple of times. The first approach was by placing the markup in browser.xul, with "display:none", then I would clone them and insert them in the tab. This did weird stuff, making it impossible to append logging nodes to the output node. Even people on the content team thought it was voodoo not worth trying to figure out.

I then looked at the way in which we dynamically apply overlays, but that won't work as it requires an id that is not dynamically generated.

There is a bug on making all of this UI into an XBL widget: bug 561458
