screenshot - Don't hide australis menu (≡) after clicking 'Move to Toolbar' in context menu.png

STR:   (Win7_64, Nightly 44, 32bit, ID 20150922030204, new profile, safe mode)
1. Click (≡), hover mouse over any button in that menu, right-click on that button.
2. Click "Move to Toolbar" menuitem in context menu.

RESULT:
The chosen button was moved to toolbar, and menu collapsed

EXPECTATIONS:
The menu should stay visible, because user may want to continue customizing. If I, let say, need to move 3 items to toolbar - I have to open menu 3 times OR enter customize mode. I could perform the same operation faster if menu wouldn't hide every time an item was moved to toolbar

NOTE:
I first thought that it's an enhancement, but noticed that it's actually inconsistency, because if in Step 2 you choose menuitem by pressing Up and Down keys, and then pressing Enter, menu doesn't collapse

That's a bug in the behaviour for Enter. The behaviour with the mouse is the one that's expected.

Philipp, thoughts?

Woah?! I've changed my mind, I don't experience this bug anymore. Please don't "fix" Enter key   v_v
Hm, I'm a bit confused, since I seem to get the exact opposite behavior:
- Selecting »Move to toolbar« with the mouse => Menu closes
- Selecting »Move to toolbar« with the keyboard => Menu stays open

Leaving the menu open seems like the better choice to me.
Oh, and I should really start paying more attention when reading bug, sorry.

Still, leaving the menu open makes sense to me, since it provides a bit more context (you see the item disappearing and re-appearing in the toolbar).

FWIW, I looked at the keypress case and I can't work out why we're not getting that. Even attaching system event listeners (or normal ones) to the actual menuitem got me nothing on OS X. No idea what's going on. If you have ideas, Matt, that'd be helpful. Not sure if this isn't causing wrong behaviour in other cases. Anyway, this fixes the issue at hand.
