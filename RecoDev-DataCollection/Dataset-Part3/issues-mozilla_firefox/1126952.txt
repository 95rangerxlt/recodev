Hi Michael -- Do you need "tokbox.com" to be whitelisted as well or just "*.tokbox.com"?
Both please.

tokbox.com added to screensharing whitelist
Chad/Brad -- Jishnu is deferring to you on whitelist decisions.  Can I get approval from either of you to add TokBox to the Firefox screensharing whitelist?  My plan is to land it on Nightly and then ask for uplift to Aurora and Beta (if there's still time to get it into Beta) since it's a trivial change.  Thanks.

Randell -- can you sanity check (especially for stupid typos) and land this today?  Thanks.
I got approval from Chad via email a few minutes ago.  We should be able to get this into tomorrow's Nightly.  Then I'll ask for aurora/beta approval.
