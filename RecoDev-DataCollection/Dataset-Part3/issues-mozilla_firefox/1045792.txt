In various brainstormings, the idea of promoting new (and old) features directly inside the main toolbar came up a few times. We should further explore that direction and create some mockups.
A possible feature to promote in that way in the near future would be Firefox Hello! (formerly Loop)

Extending the scope of this bug.

We have done some work on feature promotion using existing infrastructure in Firefox. Now we would like to explore some brand new ways of promoting features. The toolbar stuff mentioned above is just one of the components.

Some other ideas to explore:

- When a user opens the menu a call out could point out the item we want to promote (like the Sync "tip" in customize mode).
- Occasionally we drop a promotional door hanger on a schedule. What is the schedule? What are the triggers?
- Insert a banner into the menu above the strip about Sync.
- Sideways door hanger in the menu that highlights stuff in the menu.

Avenues to help with thinking:

- How would we promote light-weight themes or Loop?
- How do we promote stuff buried in customize mode?
- If items are not being put into the toolbar by default, how do we draw a users attention to those items?

This looks very good!
Next step is to coordinate with marketing and decide which of these we want to use in the near future. We can then file implementation bugs as needed.
