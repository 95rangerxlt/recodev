We need to si to all-locales. This depends on the corresponding tinderbox to be set up, thus this depends on bug 243652.

I might not be able to come up with a patch, so I need a patch buddy here, either from build, or Chris?

r=me, please request approval1.9 once we have the tinderbox tree up, and ready to be lit.
added blocking?   this gets us another locale building so would like to get it landed soon.
Checked in.

Chris restarted the buildmaster on l10n.mozilla.org, and we have the first test result there triggered, http://l10n.mozilla.org/buildbot/compare/linux-langpack/4632.

The easiest way to find the latest build on l10n.mozilla.org is to head over to http://l10n.mozilla.org/dashboard/, the 'Builds' tab has a box for 'si'.

Tinderbox build logs should show up on the next cycles on http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Mozilla-l10n-si.
