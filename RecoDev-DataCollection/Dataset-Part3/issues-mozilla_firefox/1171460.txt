The current setting of:

"comma-dangle": 1,

warns for trailing commas in objects, etc.

But, I find these are helpful in most cases, so that when you add a new item below, you don't have to worry about the previous item.

Anyway, to me I don't think this style point matters too much: it's fine to have them, and fine to not have them.

As discussed on IRC:

<pbro> jryans: I don't feel strongly at all about that rule, I don't think it's big deal if we are inconsistent on this, it doesn't hurt readability of the code, and can't be a runtime problem anyway. I disallowed it in the original version because we had 3 persons agree on that in the ehterpad

Could you elaborate why we allow trailing commas in this comment? Mention that that they make it easy to add new items to lists, and that they don't hurt readability of the code, etc..
I should add: I think these comments are very useful because they are basically our style-guide.
