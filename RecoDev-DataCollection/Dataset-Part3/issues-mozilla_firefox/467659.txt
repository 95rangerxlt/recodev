Is there a reason you're filing this now instead of waiting until 3.1b2 has been released? Some developers don't update until fairly close to the day of release. You should probably give them a few days after release to be sure.
This add-on works fine in win32 and Mac OS X86 with extensions.checkCompatibility=false. However, it fails only in Ubuntu 8.0.4

That is the reason I file the bug. 

I have done extensive testing on popular add-ons on three platforms and the results are available here https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Firefox3.1/TestResults/beta2/TopExtensions
So, the add-on is compatible with 3.1b2 but doesn't work on one platform? That sounds like a bug that should be filed with the extension developer. We typically use Firefox::Extension Compatibility to track extensions that are not at all compatible with the next release of Firefox (in this case, Firefox 3.1).
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Updating_extensions_for_Firefox_3.1 has good info on areas to check or make changes to for compatibility with fx 3.1
Yes, I see this. The javascript console says:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component is not available"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://flashblock/content/flashblock.xml ::  :: line 243"  data: no]

Line 243 of flashblock.xml is:

241: // Change the placeholder background when the mouse enters/exits the div.
242: placeholder.onmouseover = function()
243: {
244:	this.style.background = this.bgActive;
245: }

which certainly doesn't look like the culprit. Investigating further.

This was working fine on 3.1b1.
That line was a red herring... but it turns out that this was a bug in the latest unstable Flashblock (we were calling Components.utils.lookupMethod instead of Components.lookupMethod). I uploaded a fixed version of Flashblock unstable to mozdev, but it might be a while until all the mirrors get it (if you want to be sure, check the MD5sum - should be 326fa184dc8931ac52adb57c78a7c986).
Flashblock has no platform dependent code.

WFM with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20081210 Minefield/3.2a1pre.

I changed Components.lookupMethod to Components.utils.lookupMethod because I was getting 'Components.lookupMethod is deprecated" strict warnings in the Error Console.

If Components.utils is available in Win32 and OSX but not ubuntu/linux this points to a packaging problem or something else
Lorenzo if you go to the Error Console and evaluate this:

"lookupMethod" in Components.utils

What do you get?

If I type in the Error Console:

Components.utils.lookupMethod

I get:

function lookupMethod() {
    [native code]
}
FYI: WFM Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081211 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre

Lorenzo, are you using a nightly 3.1b2 from mozilla.org or building it yourself?
I get the same:

"lookupMethod" in Components.utils
true

Components.utils.lookupMethod:
function lookupMethod() {
    [native code]
}

This is 3.1b2 from the auto-updater. User-agent is:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2
OK. I can now reproduce the problem in 3.2a1pre (and probably in 3.1b2 as well, I just needed a bigger range of test pages to trigger this bug).

The Error Console message is:

Error: Permission denied for <http://www.bakketun.net> to get property XPCComponents.utils
Source file: chrome://flashblock/content/flashblock.xml
Line: 17
Perhaps you needed a bigger range of test pages because one of the lookupMethod calls was Components.lookupMethod and the other was Components.utils.lookupMethod? My change set them both to Components.lookupMethod.

:P

I've pushed the fix to the latest dev version at:
<http://downloads.mozdev.org/flashblock/flashblock-1.5.unstable.xpi>

I've pushed this to AMO as well:

<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/433>
Marking as fixed as I've filed a new bug more specific to the problem
new bug is bug 469844
