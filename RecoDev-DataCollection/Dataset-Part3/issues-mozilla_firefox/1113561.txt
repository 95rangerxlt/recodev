Reproducible on: Firefox 34.0.5 (20141126041045), Firefox 35.0b5 (20141218174327), Aurora 36.0a2 (2014-12-18), Nightly 37.0a1 (2014-12-18).

Affected platform(s): Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit, Windows 8.1 32-bit and Mac OS X 10.9.5.

STR:
1. Launch Firefox with a new profile.
2. From about:home's search bar, perform several searches for different terms, e.g. example1, example2, ..., example5.
3. Open a new tab and access about:home again.
4. Type 'example' without the apostrophe in the page's search bar.

Expected result: several past searches are displayed in the suggestions pane, along with a few suggestions for that term.

Actual result: only two random past searches are displayed in the suggestions pane (i.e. example2. example3), along with several suggestions.

Notes:
(a) The search bar displayed in the toolbar seems to display the complete search history - all five searches.
(b) If search suggestions are disabled, about:home and about:newtab display more than 2 past searches.

In the search box we use at most half of the 10 rows for history searches. It seems the about:home page uses at most 2 out of 6 rows (ie. less than half). Is this per design?
I don't know if it's per design, but it seems odd.
Assuming we can't/shouldn't show more suggestions in total because of the space restrictions on about:home, it still seems sensible to have the same 50/50 split as in the search box (so a maximum of 3 history searches)
The value 2 is at http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/63006936ab99/browser/modules/ContentSearch.jsm#l271

We should replace it with 3 per comment 2.

I would also like these two magic constants (3 and 6) to become consts at the top of the file with descriptive names.

It seems this cap to 2 history entries was introduced in bug 612453 comment 30. The reason given was "since I'm not implementing scrolling". Doesn't seem very compelling :-).

Looks good, thanks. I wonder if about:home had tests that could break due to this change. Please push to try and run mochitest-bc tests there before making this as checkin-needed.
