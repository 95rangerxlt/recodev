With the debugger paused on a line:
1) Click "Add watch expression", causing input box to show
2) Type the name of a variable in the function scope
3) Press enter

After the steps above, the message "Add watch expression" replaces the input box. No watch expressions are shown

What page have you tested on?

Does it still happen in Nightly? I remember an issue with watch expressions throwing and not showing at all if there was a "use strict" statement in the targeted script, but that should have been fixed with bug 832470.
Ah, yes, it does seem to be related to 'use strict'. I can add watch expression after I remove the 'use strict' declaration.
And it looks fixed in Nightly. Thanks!
