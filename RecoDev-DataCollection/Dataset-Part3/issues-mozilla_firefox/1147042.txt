In bug 1134180, we agree that |attachProcess| should be |getProcess| to match the new |getTab|, and also because attach is a separate concept.

Thanks!

There is a failure on try, but that looks unrelated...
Let's try xpcshell one more time...

Doesn't this affect Thunderbird, Fennec, WebRT and others?
It shouldn't as soon as they are setting DebuggerServer.allowChromeProcess=true.

Thunderbird is based on mozilla - central, right ?
We plan to uplift this patch in order to ensure all released version uses get process. So if Thunderbird is using its own branches, we would have to uplift also on TB branches.

The only thing to know is that it will break main process debugging when using a older Firefox version against a newer Firefox/Thunderbird 39/40 version. But it is going to work if you both uses the latest.
