Apparently, "Properties" is not well understood. "Computed" would make more sense.

Really? "Properties" is a plural noun. "Computed" is an adjective (or a verb in the past tense). I know other tools refer to "computed styles" but the word computed alone is not a great UI fixture.

...

Talked with Paul a bit and agree that there is no great descriptive word for these Computed Styles. For the sake of brevity, and consistency with other developer tools, Computed is probably what we'll need to go with.

patch v1

could you add a LOCALIZATION NOTE describing what "Computed" is? That it refers to the computed styles of the currently selected node in the Page Inspector's Style sidebar.

Thanks!

Why didn't you change also the tooltip key name with the other two keys?

Honestly I have big problems understanding what "Computed" stands for, could you please explain it with some more detail?

From MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.getComputedStyle
Computed styles are the final used values of all the CSS properties of an element.

It refers to this documentation: Used Value
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/used_value

Maybe "Used Values" is better than "Computed".

I think "Computed Style" is what web devs understand the best.
I think change the value of 'style.highlighter.button.tooltip' and not renamining will cause some trouble for localization!

Can you please file a bug for that?

I opend bug 728833.
Honestly I believe that's too late for that (don't do it on Aurora!)
We can still do it on central, and take that update with the next cycle.
