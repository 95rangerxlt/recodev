After the landing of bug 875488 the panorama icon has been switched back to the old version. It doesn't look good. The new one should be reimplemented.

The icons look identical to me on OS X retina, between Nightly and latest UX. Which platform/OS are you seeing this on?
Windows when the icon is in the menu panel or in the customization palette. Stephen mentioned that he will update the spritesheet to add it back in bug 875488 comment 9.
This sounds like visual polish which isn't the worst of our problems right now -> P4.

Screenshot of the issue

For the record, this is how it looks like on Win7 at the moment. The tab group icon is the only one that looks blurry.
Note that the icon in the list all tab menu should be updated too.
This is terribly blurry on Retina, and sounds like it's wrong on normal-dpi Windows too.

Steven, can we get an icon?
Per Stephen, Michael, could you take this too? :-)
