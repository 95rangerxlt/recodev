@Aza: I don't see the "List all tabs" button anymore based on the mockups.  If we don't keep the button, please mark this as invalid.

Raymond, that is a good point re: the mockups. I do not think, however, that we can get rid of the "list all tabs" button so easily, unfortunately. For now the "list all tabs" button should continue existing and should only show the tabs from the current group. I'll work on a full specification.
I'm going to assign this to Raymond on the assumption that limiting that menu to just visible tabs is work we'll have to do regardless of what Aza comes up with in his "full specification".

Reassigning to Aza in case he wants this bug for his "full specification" work. Otherwise, please resolve as fixed.
I like how you always put "full specification" in quotes. Upon further reflection none is needed. Marking this bug as resolved and fixed.
