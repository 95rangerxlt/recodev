Latest count: 144.

So I'm just going to go through and either update bug links, file bugs, or re-enable, as much as I can...

First off: there are 9 tests that are marked as depending on e10s zoom. However, e10s zoom is fixed, but the tests are disabled because of bug 1056146, it seems. They mostly still fail locally if I re-enable them. Here's a try push that re-enables one, which seems to work fine locally, and updates the comments for the other ones:

In other news, I'm tracking this in a spreadsheet because I think otherwise I might go crazy:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hLBi9xSvbO5HeZfS2fYU8FtpoGf0P7mYryFCOz9h2o8/edit?usp=sharing

I... can't say I've fully worked out how to sensibly keep this up-to-date yet, so I'm just marking rows as 'done' instead, so I can filter appropriately.

(while I could rerun the trivial grep that I used to make the list and re-paste it in the first sheet, when N rows go missing, any additional annotations I made will be off-by-N)
Oh, and I meant to paste:

The 10.6 orange appeared in the retrigger; it's an unrelated intermittent failure in session store, as best I can tell. Otherwise all the retriggers were green.

bug 961529, which the bug referenced in the comments (removed by this patch) was duped to, was fixed. The notifications are now properly propagated from content to the parent process, AFAIK.

No, skip-if lines apply to the [test] *above* the skip-if instruction. Think ini files with headers over sections. So browser_bug559991.js works now that zoom works on e10s.

> Does this one not use the promiseTabLoadEvent?

It does, via FullZoomHelper.load (in browser/base/content/test/general/head.js). However, promiseTabLoadEvent isn't actually broken in e10s; It seems the rest of the fullzoom (test helper) code is busted somehow for the other tests (all the other tests whose comments I changed fail locally). I guess I'll morph bug 1056146 to reflect that and update these comments.

> Other than this, this patch is all updated comments

Yeah; I guess next time I'll just land that part without r?; it doesn't really make sense to bother anyone else with that. Sorry!

Annnnd the next test to hit the network is browser_contextSearchTabPosition.js, which in a moment of impressive fail manages to crash the test(s) that run after it instead of itself. New try push:

This concludes looking at all the tests that are specifically disabled on e10s (ie not just skip-if = true) that have a comment with a bug number.

There are still some 40-odd tests other than the ones covered by bug 1094222 that need looking at. They split roughly equally into "says it's disabled because it touches content (without a bug number)" and "doesn't say that, but does have a comment, without a bug number".

I plan to spend the rest of the iteration looking at those, and filing followup bugs for whatever I don't manage to look at before Tuesday.

Surprisingly, all-green:

https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/2df1080da369
Not counting the test for which I'm waiting for review, this leaves 24 tests which need to be examined, which are the subject of bug 1094205 as they have 0 comments as to why they are e10s-disabled. All the other tests now have up-to-date bug numbers and as best an explanation I could find as to why they're disabled.

I intend to remove leave-open after the previous cset lands on m-c, and close this bug once I can land the aforementioned patch.

Had to re-disable another test because it basically only runs "meaningfully" on 10.8, which isn't run on try by default because of capacity issues, apparently... - and of course, it broke when I actually landed the enabling patch.
