The in-content preferences should be rendered the same way as about:addons, without the navigation toolbar.

To do this

1) Add a testcase for about:preferences to test_disablechrome.js (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_disablechrome.js#141). This is similar to the work that was done for bug 716464.
2) Run the test to make sure that the test fails for about:preferences.
3) Add about:preferences to the inContentWhitelist here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#4425
4) Run the test to make sure that the test passes for about:preferences.

remove toolbar

I have added about:preferences to the inContentWhitelist, but the new tests are still failing and I cannot figure out why. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

remove toolbar for in-content preferences

Everything appears to be working correctly! All tests pass :)

Gah, so many whitespace changes! They are for the better though, so we could undo the whitespace fixes or leave them. I'm fine with the fixes staying. r=me with Blair's approval.
yea, Blair said the same thing, duno how those happened :/

Keep the function naming consistent with the rest of the file - run_chrome_about_test_5.
Ditto for run_chrome_about_test_6.

I'd rather not have them land with this, on the odd change that this gets backed out at any stage (unnecessary churn in related code).

Fixed naming issues and removed unrelated whitespace from browser.js :)
