adds id="menu_BookmarksPopup" to the bookmarks popup

"menu_BookmarksPopup" is consistent with the other popup ids, but the proposed
seamonkey patch uses something different (
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175175 )
If this is fixed before 1.0, extension writers can have a nice clean interface 
which is widely deployed.

requesting review - Vladimir, if you're not the right person for this, please
throw it to someone else - blake?

works for me, r=vladimir@pobox.com

Note that once I get to reviewing/testing the patch in bug 169837, we might
even have a better extension story for putting in items (giving separate vboxes
within menus that extensions can attach into)

requesting approval - just adding a missing id for the benefit of extensions

Vladimir (or anyone else watching) - could you check this in for josh-m please?
thanks
vlad, do you know if this has been checked in yet?
Sorry 'bout that, checked in now, both branch and trunk.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
