Add ability to highlight Dev Tools in chrome.


Use case at hand:
In the /firstrun experience for the developer edition browser, we will:
- highlight icon in toolbar (appears as default in toolbar for this build) 
- extend a doorhanger from the feature icon with a brief message describing feature. Doorhanger will also include 'not now' link and green CTA button from our standard UITour doorhanger template.


We will not open the feature itself for this /firstrun tour.

Possible future use cases could be highlighting feature from a snippet, product page, or future first-run tour.

Added the ID's to the UITour's target, and modified the unit tests too to work with both m-c and gum.
This patch fixes also bug 1078454.

Matt, I set you as reviewer because you reviewed a similar patch for the loop button; but feel free to assign to anyone else if you think he/her fits more. Thanks!

In the future, you should probably be more careful about double-checking the commit information before pushing on somebody else's behalf.

And Matteo, you should probably make sure you have Mercurial properly configured to generate patches with the correct metadata included from the start :)

When will we be able to view this in Gum?
It is present on Gum now.

I don't see either "devtools" or "webide" when querying getConfiguration('availableTargets') in 35.0a2 (2014-11-03). Can someone please provide a link to the latest build so I can check again?
I can see this on gum:

gum$ hg log -r caaf56e6e947
changeset:   225809:caaf56e6e947
user:        Matteo Ferretti <zer0@mozilla.com>
date:        Thu Oct 30 13:35:25 2014 +0000
summary:     Bug 1078455 - UITour: Add ability to highlight Dev. Tools and WebIDE toolbar buttons. r=MattN+bmo, a=lsblakk

I don't know why it doesn't seem to work though. You can find the latest builds at:

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=gum
I downloaded gum from the link provided by Panos, and I checked that that build has the patch:

jar:file:///Users/ZER0/Desktop/FirefoxDeveloperEditionDebug.app/Contents/Resources/browser/omni.ja!/modules/UITour.jsm

The patch also modified the unit test, that use `getConfiguration('availableTargets')`, so I'm pretty sure the method returns both `devtools` and `webide` (the last one if the pref is set):

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/test/browser_UITour_availableTargets.js#28

So I guess it should works with this build, Alex. But let me know if there are any issue.
Thanks Matteo,

When I download the latest build from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/gum-macosx64/latest/ I see the targets as expected! Looks like this patch just landed :)

Oddly, the latest build comes up as Aurora for me (with the light UI and no dev branding). Not sure why, but that's unrelated to this bug.

Unfortunately that URL does not contain the actual latest build (perhaps because there are some jobs still pending). You should download the one here:

This is because that build didn't have all the necessary changes.
