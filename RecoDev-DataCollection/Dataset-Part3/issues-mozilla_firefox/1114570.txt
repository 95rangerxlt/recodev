The go button should be an arrow, not a search glass.

The selector used to change the icon should be specific to the non-oneoffui : searchbar:not([oneoffui])

Florian/Brian, not sure who knows about this.

Tim, can you provide more details? This is working for me in beta, and right now it's not clear to me whether this is devedition (theme) only, also on Nightly, a regression, needs specific steps to reproduce, or something else.
My guess is this refers to http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b915a50bc6be/browser/themes/shared/devedition.inc.css#l249

For the normal themes, we have 2 rules:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b915a50bc6be/browser/themes/linux/searchbar.css#l57
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b915a50bc6be/browser/themes/linux/searchbar.css#l93
Brian, want to have a look? I promise fast reviews! :-)
This rule [0] should also be made specific.

Nope, actually, this element doesn't exist for the oneoffui search bar.

We should fix the arrow for the oneoffui case, too.

The arrow used by the oneoffui is the urlbar one, and there's a bug filed about the urlbar icon being too dark : bug 1095836 (which is waiting for assets).
Should we wait for bug 1095836 or can we land this fix ?

No, and no. We should fix this to use the same icon, then when the icon gets replaced, this fix will "just work".

Tim, could you update this patch as noted in Comment 10?

So, right now devedition isn't using any custom asset for that 'go' icon.  We are waiting for one in Bug 1095836 - there isn't anything to switch to right now.  So unless if I'm misunderstanding the request, I'd vote for landing this fix.

We can land it because it's better than nothing, but it'd be good to get an updated asset for the (default) dark case... :-\
