remove distribution dir when not packaging testpilot

This directory houses the testpilot extension, when channel == beta or aurora. We already add testpilot to removed-files when the channel is something different, we should this directory, too.

:rs told me that we should drop searchplugins/ from the list as a ridealong, because it's no longer empty.

I don't think this is right *at all*! We don't just use this for testpilot, Wouldn't we would be blowing away all the custom partner builds on update, which is very very bad.
Entries in removed-files.in that end with a slash will only be removed if they are a directory and the directory is empty. Entries that end with /* will be removed recursively.

Signed,
actually knows this stuff ;)
