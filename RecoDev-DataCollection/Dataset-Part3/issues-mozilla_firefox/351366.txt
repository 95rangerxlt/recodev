I honestly don't see how this check-in could've caused these leaks. Gavin checked something in shortly after, but according to the logs his patch couldn't have possibly gotten into this build. I'm thinking maybe one of the tinderbox configs. changed.

TR:

Could you see if any of these configs changed around this time? CVS should have the info (and I'm pretty sure the balsa-* VM's are on auto-update.

Please let us know if they're not.
Is this for firefox? None of the firefox tinderbox configs have changed in the CVS in over a month.
Now that I look at it I'm pretty sure that Mano's patch could've caused this. Sorry, build guys.
When mconnor did the theme update last night (2006-09-11 03:02) he killed the CSS that had the XBL binding for the <hbox> that Mano added that caused this leak (whew).

In fact, mconnor's patch brought down the leaks a bit more. :)
