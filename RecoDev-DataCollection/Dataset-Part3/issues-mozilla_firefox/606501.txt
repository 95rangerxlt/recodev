If the text entry line the clipboard is being pasted into already has characters, any tabs in the paste buffer will appear as four spaces. If there are no characters on the line, the tabs are retained.

Having additional characters in the paste buffer (including line breaks) does not affect the outcome.

Pasting the onto a new line then deleting the line break preserves the tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a tab character into your paste buffer (here's one:	)
2. Paste into any text input field, on a line which already has characters
Actual Results:  
Any tabs are replaced by four spaces

Expected Results:  
Tab character are pasted intact

using notepad.exe and 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101022 Firefox/4.0b8pre ID:20101022043027

copy tab char using notepad exe.
paste into textarea or input which already has characters in this page.
Oh yeah, testing in a nightly would have helped. Looks like it's already been fixed.
