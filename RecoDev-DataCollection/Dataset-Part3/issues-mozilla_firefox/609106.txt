Now that Firefox trunk uses out-of-process plugins we need to add the plugin-container.exe file to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\ShimInclusionList registry key as otherwise WMP falls back to version 6.4.

Adds a simple registry key so that Firefox users will not get the old Windows Media Player 6.4 plugin fallback (instead they'll then get the current WMP plugin).

rs=Standard8 by inspection. I've not tested this.

Well, uh, thanks for that, but can I check-in my patches myself? Someone already reminded me of that patch today.

Sure: I just (wrongly) assumed "SeaMonkey Patch Needs landing" on SM Status Meeting and no reply here for 2.5 months meant "checkin-needed" :-/
