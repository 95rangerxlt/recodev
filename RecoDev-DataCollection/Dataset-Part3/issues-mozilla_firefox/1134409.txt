STR:

1) Visit a site with some <video/>s on it in an e10s window
2) Right-click on a <video/>, and choose "Full Screen"

This causes an "unsafe CPOW usage" warning in the Browser Console.

In browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js:

  fullScreenVideo: function () {
    let video = this.target;
    if (document.mozFullScreenEnabled)
      video.mozRequestFullScreen(); <-- Causes CPOW warning
  },
