Yes, this most probably IS about the newly introduced border-color transistion.

Of course, I'll back that up and confirm this by pushing some try-runs.

I don't think introducing a .14 regression on TART is acceptable against keeping a transition that is hardly noticeable... right?
Yes, I think we'll want to remove the transition.
Baseline push: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=b5b2a8f12eca
Push with transitions disabled: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=77b707ea721c

Comparison table: http://compare-talos.mattn.ca/?oldRevs=b5b2a8f12eca&newRev=77b707ea721c&server=graphs.mozilla.org&submit=true
The comparison table shows a solid .12 and .14 win on TART for Windows 7 and 8, respectively.

Next up: patch to remove transition for realz.
