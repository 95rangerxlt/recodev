I discovered two major flaws in the private browsing implementation inside the download manager module.

1. We should prompt for all active downloads when the user is leaving the private browsing mode, not just non-resumable ones.  Because once the user leaves the private browsing mode, they will no longer be able to access their downloads inside the PB mode.

2. We fail to register the NS_PRIVATE_BROWSING_REQUEST_TOPIC observer, which means that the prompting code has never been in effect, and so far the download manager had never prompted any user while switching the PB mode.

I have a patch which fixes both these issues, and also adds a test to make sure that this behavior would not regress in the future.

Won't take this in 3.5, will take a reviewed/tested/baked patch in a future 3.6 release but not "blocking".

nit: (void) the unchecked AddObserver call please

r=sdwilsh
Landed with the nit in comment 3 on trunk: <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4d7bde383df5>.
Backed out due to test failures, please stick around in #developers for a time after landing to deal with any problems that occur.

Shawn, do you have any idea what might be going on here?

I know zero about that code.
*** Bug 553773 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I found out that the assertion in comment 8 was caused by a bug in the cache code.  I filed that as bug 567680 with a patch.  Once that patch lands, this one can also reland without modification.

Patch (v1)

The unit test for this bug requires the patch in bug 567680 as well (which should be pretty safe.)  I'll apply that patch for approval as well.
This seemed to have turned three browser-chrome boxes orange, so I backed it out again:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b89301b59521

The failure logs:
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1274727181.1274727881.26342.gz
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1274727171.1274728361.28455.gz
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1274727330.1274728455.28851.gz

I'll investigate this tomorrow.
FWIW, I've verified that my patch in bug 567821 solves the unit test failures.  I'm currently waiting for Gavin's review of that patch to land this bug.

We will not be taking this for 3.6.6. Moving approval request forward.

If you disagree, send me an email.

Christian, what happened to the approval request on this bug?  Did it get lost somewhere along the way?
