patch v1.0

this works upon patch in bug 422181 (i'll review it soon), since i need a places command to add a bookmark on an history page.
For this reason won't make 3.5, but would be cool to have this on 3.6 to test for changes in bug 491221.

"Dialog window should not be closed by pressing Esc in folder name textbox..."

Looks good, but I'd like to run it here when bug 422181 is done.  Thanks for cleaning up the other parts in the file.

+            self.window.document.documentElement.cancelDialog();
+          });
+      }, false);
+    foldersExpander.doCommand();
+  },

Too much indentation for both the addEventListener and executeSoon callbacks.  With that and the nit in comment 2, r=adw.

since bug 422181 can't make 1.9.1 (l10n changes), this can't make 1.9.1
