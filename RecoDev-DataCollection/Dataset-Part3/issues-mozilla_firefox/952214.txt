We faced at least 2 major regressions this week that ended up breaking the app manager device support completely.

We used to face exception happening during actor instanciation due to some specific around actor loading on b2g and/or specific behavior of JSM on b2g.
It doesn't hit existing tests, as they all start DebuggerServer manually.

Ideally we would have a more functional test that would experience real world codepath for starting the debugger server.

We can easily do that by tweaking the existing webapps actor mochitest plain test script in order to trigger shell.js code instead of spawning our own server instance.

Re-enable webapps actor mochitest on b2g desktop and cover shell.js debugger server initialization

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=09172eea8c4d

First thing, this mochitest was disabled on b2g desktop...
Fix a small thing in specialpowers to get it working again.

Then, on b2g, I toggle the remote-enabled setting in order 
to trigger b2g/settings.js, that itself calls shell.js:RemoteDebugger.start().
I have seen the test fail on styleeditor regression as my tree was outdated,
so it could have avoided such regression!


Now that would be worth looking if we can somehow test getAppActor request,
and see if we get working tab actors out of it!
The test fails on the emulator, but works fine locally on b2g desktop :(

Sounds like a race between the chrome script and the setting toggle.

This will need to be revisited once bug 942756 lands (I'll take care of that).
