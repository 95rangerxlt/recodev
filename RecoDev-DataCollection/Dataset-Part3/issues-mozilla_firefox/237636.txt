Simple. I grabbed cvs sources (up to date a midnight - mozilla.org time), and
build them.

When I try to enter a search in the search box, or if I try to enter an
incomplete adress, like google.com instead of www.google.com, nothing happens.

But, I have this error in JS console (on each try) :

Error: [Exception... "'Permission denied to get property XULElement.searchParam'
when calling method: [nsIAutoCompleteInput::searchParam]"  nsresult: "0x8057001e
(NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_STRING)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: no]




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Grab up to date sources
2.Build them
3.see details

Actual Results:  
nothing and error in JS console

Expected Results:  
Doing search / going to URL.

Bugfix for bug 226365 could be guilty here.

Build is not usable at all :[

Confirmed in official build, downloaded from

Adding regression keyword, because it is a really nasty one :[

Confirmed with the latest Win32 installer using Windows 2000:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040316
Firefox/0.8.0+

Linux is affected as well: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7b)
Gecko/20040316 Firefox/0.8.0+ (Steffen).
A workaround is to use the Go button.

Probably already fixed:

Firefox/0.8.0+1

"Backing out the fix for bug 235457 since it made typing URLs, and autocomplete
in the the URL bar not work." ! 
Works again on Linux as well. Marking fixed and clearing blocking0.9? flag.
