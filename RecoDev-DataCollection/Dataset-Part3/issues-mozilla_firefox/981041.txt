We had a pref to disable the CSS transitions when the Style Editor changes a style on the page.

It was unused, but we should add it back so we can disable the transitions for tests (see the orange at bug 966805).

This involves adding a new pref "pref("devtools.styleeditor.transitions", true)". And setting this pref to `false` for the test at browser/devtools/styleeditor/test/browser_styleeditor_sourcemap_watching.js.
The code for disabling the transition would go in browser/devtools/styleeditor/StyleSheetEditor.jsm in the "_updateStyleSheet" function, the second argument to stylesheet.update() is whether or not to use transitions (right now it's always true).
I would like to work on this bug.

Thanks,

Hi Sayan, let me know if you can work on this. I can do it if you don't have time, no problem.
Hi,

Sorry for being late, took me sometime reading stuffs. 

I want to know whenever i set "devtools.styleeditor.transitions" to false via browser, I get an error "this._notifyStyleApplied is not a function". I tried search for the function but did not get. How to solve this error?

Also, I want to know do I need to create the browser_styleeditor_sourcemap_watching.js file as it does not exist.

Hm, I'm not sure why you're getting this error, if you post your current patch, I could take a look though.

Ah, this file is at browser/devtools/styleeditor/test/browser_styleeditor_sourcemap_watching.js

That's coming from toolkit/devtools/server/actors/stylesheets.js

Yes, the error is coming from that file. The method notifyStyleApplied is not defined, so should i define that function?

Rebased + bug fix

Here's a rebased patch.

Thanks Sayan for the patch, it looks good. I figured out that issue and made the minor fix. I'm sorry for taking so long to get back around to this.

Since this is for our tests (and thus also covered by them) I don't see a reason for additional testing from the Manual QA team. Setting as qe-verify-. Set it back to qe-verify+ if you think it needs the attention of the QA team.
