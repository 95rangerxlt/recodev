Test Case

STR:

1. Load the attached test case
2. Open up the web console
3. Select [...]

Expected:

I'd expect a truncated string within a dialog to appear with some ... to indicate the string is too long to display.

Actual:

Firefox will get hung at this point.

Thanks for the bug report! Going to submit a patch ASAP.

proposed patch

This is the proposed patch. The problem seems to be related to the veeery slow rendering of big text nodes. This is why the entire Firefox UI hangs.

The approach for this fix is to limit the text node length for strings coming from the LongStringActor. The constant I picked is based on my system: I picked a value that is rendered instantly. I did not limit the length of strings at the protocol level - if you think we should, please let me know.

The test uses the new waitForMessages() helper, with improvements. I expect I will continue to improve that, on a case-by-case basis (whenever I need it).

Jason, Panos: do you believe we should make a patch for Aurora as well? This doesn't seem to be a hang that users would encounter often.

Thank you!

I don't see how we could make a useful fix without a new warning message and Aurora is string-frozen.

test fixes

Previous try push failed. 500000 chars in a text node is too much for debug builds on the try servers - had failures.

Lowered to 200000 chars and made other minor test changes and now I had a green try push:

Thanks for the review. I intend to land this patch tomorrow, once bug 859858 reaches fx-team from inbound.

If a patch for aurora is needed we can simply limit how much we display from the long string (as we do now), and have no additional warning.

I expect this to result in new bugs filed: "console doesn't display long strings correctly". IMHO behavior that could be interpreted to indicate data corruption should be avoided.

For Aurora and Beta one would prefer such data corruption over a complete browser freeze that, depending on the string length, can result in a forced kill, which in turn results in more data loss.
