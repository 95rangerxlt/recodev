If the tabs are hidden, the background that's usually on the nav bar when tabs-on-top is activated, is still there.

Reproducible: Always

Steven, what is the design direction here?
The nav bar doesn't need the background, and it's only there so it should match the active tab.

A side point: I think that the tabs on top menu button should be invisible (or disbled) when the tab bar is hidden.
This bug is also on popups (there's a worthless background around the nav bar).
Steven, could you comment here?
Are we marking this as won't fix or blocking final release?
