This was regressed by the flat panel styling. :-(

Review of attachment 8368533:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This seems somewhat on the high side when placing the item before non-wide items post-customizing, and conversely, while customizing, putting it before a 2-line-labelled small item, it seems quite small (which goes away after customization ends). However, it's clearly better than what we have and the consequences of this will change again once bug 897496 lands, so I think we should take this as at least it's a big improvement.

For bonus points, please add (in the correct place, probably in customizeMode.inc.css, check if we don't already have a rule for this):

#wrapper-search-container[place="panel"] {
  width: @menuPanelWidth@;
}

Although perhaps we should auto-fix a class to the toolbarpaletteitem wrapper for .panel-wide-items and use that... but that's definitely a separate bug.
