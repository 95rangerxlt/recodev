Which ones look blurry, and which ones don't have the correct opacity?

Are you saying that you were seeing these issues before bug 951726 landed?

No, I'm saying that the old results were the same as the build just before bug 951726. Sorry, I wasn't clear here.
Just to clarify, the issue only happened after the bug.
Can you say specifically which icons on the tab bar are blurry, and which do not have correct opacity?

This seems quite obvious in attachment 8356751 :
Blurry :
- All default tabbar icons (aka non-addons), you can notice this better when selecting a tab.
- All command buttons


Opacity :
Close/sidebar/dock to bottom buttons
The debugger, options and profiler icons are not too much blurry actually. Inspector, Console, Network and Style Editor icons are the most visible. (Again, command buttons are blurry too).
This might actually be a regression of bug 947309.
Updated the problematic bug. It was actually landed on the same day, that's why I thought it was the other bug.
> Opacity :
> Close/sidebar/dock to bottom buttons

The brightness on the docking and close icons isn't quite the same as the others (you can see this in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8356751).

needinfoing Darrin to see if we should replace dock-side, dock-bottom, close, and undock images.

As far as blurriness, I'm not sure that I'm seeing all the same issues you are.  Assuming I'm just not seeing the problem, it is possible that we should just use 1x icons, but if it is possible to tweak the 2x so that they downsample better (especially for the tab icons, which are a bigger deal to provide alternates on), I think this would be ideal.

By the way, the images currently in use are from 'DevTools - Icons @2x - 01' in Bug 837188.

I guess you could provide both, pretty much like Firefox's UI does.
Then use media queries to target hdpi.
As shown in the screenshot, the command icons are a bit too bright too.
To my eye the dock, undock and close icons all share the same (less bright) appearance. The command icons (responsive, etc.) are brighter by design. Is this what you were referring to?

Sorry, to clarify: "too bright" in comparison to what?

I see the same thing you do.  I just realized that we don't need a new image though - they are less bright because of opacity after all.  Should I go ahead and remove that opacity to bring the brightness up to the level of the command buttons, or add opacity to the command buttons to bring them down to the others?

Compared to the tab icons ? But that might just because 2x icons were scaled down.

In reference to Comment 17, here is what it looks like when bringing opacity up or down uniformly.

I think this is too bright, maybe you could just bring up the opacity of the close/dock buttons
Regarding the blurriness:
Instead of pushing 2x icons, and then force scaling them back to 16x16, and hardcoding image paths in .js, one could also just set class names and let the theme assign the correct icons (including 1x/2x selection.

I don't think you'll need JS to add specific HDPI images, you can do that with CSS.

I should be clear - the tabs are special.  Since extension developers can add their own tabs, the icon URL is part of the panel definition (specified in JS and used in an <image> tag in the markup).  There isn't really a great way to move this logic to CSS, and we would prefer to not have to specify more than one image here to keep the API as simple as possible.

To be honest, I never really thought the dock/close icons being less bright was an issue. I personally think their current appearance relative to the command icons looks best, but would be open to hearing an argument otherwise (vs. "just too bright").

This is fine with me.
I think the brightness should be consistent, but not too bright. A bit like attachment 8356753 shows.

Here is the inspector icon. Original at 16px snapped, so it's off center (may need to nudge it 1px right). Let's see how it looks.

Darrin, here is the screenshot comparing SVG vs png (left vs right).  I think it is a lot clearer, and worth trying out all the tab icons as SVG like you've done with the inspector icon here.  Can you send them over when you get a chance to convert them?

And one more thing - can you send over new 1x and 2x dark theme icons for the command buttons that currently have a drop shadow?

Not sure what you need here, Stephen Horlander attached them in the main bug.

Can you add the SVG icon for debugger-paused?  It is the debugger icon with a green outline, you can see the current version over at Bug 837188.

And also the icon for the options panel (currently tool-options.png).

Ah, I keep finding them one by one.. I also need tool-scratchpad.png.  I think those three are the only ones I need.  So:

* tool-debugger-paused.png
* tool-scratchpad.png
* tool-options.png

Darrin, here is a screenshot at 1x and 2x with the new tool and command icons.  Note that I'm reusing the inspector icon for the option icon until I get the latest.  This is also increased to 28px from 26px.

Patrick,
Can you have a look at the CSS and jar changes I've made here?  Basically, I've just replaced some pngs with SVGs, and added / updated the command 1x and 2x icons.  Pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=3b98eccddd9b

Much better ! Though, the style editor icon is still a bit blurry, and the brightness issue is still there.
