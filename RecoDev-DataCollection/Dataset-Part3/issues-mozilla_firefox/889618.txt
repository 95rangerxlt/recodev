On startup with today's nightly build, if Session Restore restores the Firefox OS Simulator's Dashboard page, and that page is the active tab, then the Dashboard doesn't display the list of apps registered with the Simulator, and its Simulator toggle switch doesn't work.

Some investigation shows that the Dashboard's script is being loaded, and it does post messages to the addon's content script (which mediates communication between the addon's main script and the Dashboard).  But the content script doesn't receive them, so it doesn't pass them on to the addon, and thus it doesn't trigger the addon to send the Dashboard a list of apps, toggle the Simulator, etc.

Reloading the page corrects the problem, as does opening the tab anew as well as starting on a different tab and then switching to the Dashboard tab.

Yesterday's nightly works fine, as do Aurora, Beta, and Release versions of Firefox.

Per Gavin, likely dupe of bug 888972, so marking as such until evidence to contrary.

I thought this was maybe related to bug 888986? If yesterday's Nightly works fine then it shouldn't be caused by newtab preloading.
Hmm, let's see what it breaks indeed!
So the problem is that we start loading an invalid page before the add-on had a chance to initialize channels and protocols. I wonder why this worked before - I mean I can see why it did but it's not like it was guaranteed to.
Bug 888986 has been backed out.
Backout is now on m-c.
