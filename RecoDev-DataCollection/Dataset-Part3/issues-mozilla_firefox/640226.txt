on both my machines pdf files become transparent (everything is transparent except for the white parts) when I go into fullscreen mode of the browser (f11)
also the top bars don't disappear any more when looking at pdf file.
happens with all pdf files I've found so far (including pdf files from random google searches)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use a theme (not default theme)
2.go into fullscreen mode (f11)
3.open a pdf file
4.make top bars appear
Actual Results:  
pdf file was transparrent + top bars stay though they should go out of sight

Expected Results:  
firefox should display the pdf file normally and give the full screen back after using the bars at the top (url, tabs)

both machines work on windows 7
doesn't happen with default theme does with both Krivan and Yosemite

Able to reproduce. After installing a persona and going into full screen mode and opening a pdf file becomes opaque. Hovering the move on top of the screen, shows the navigational bar. Hovering or clicking on the window, navigational bar does not hide.
confirmed. This should be fixed by bug 633282. But it won't get into the 4.0 final, unfortunately.
For some reason glass margins all go negative in this case. I've got a bunch of patches applies at the moment so I can't debug but I'll look into this this weekend to be sure it's not a widget/glass bug that can be easily fixed.

don't skip plugin tests w/mHideChrome

> it also just happened with flash video

yes it'll happen for all plugins. We'll try to get this into 2.0.1 which should be out pretty quick after the initial release.

I can still reproduce this on:
Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110404 Firefox/4.2a1pre

The navigational bar does not hide after hovering the mouse on the top of the screen.

The transparency issue was the only part fixed here. Auto hide issues with pdfs displayed in tabs is covered by bug 437929.
