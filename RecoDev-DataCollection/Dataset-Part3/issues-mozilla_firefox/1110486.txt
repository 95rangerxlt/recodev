This is my fault.

Apparently MarkupView uses promises from deprecated-sync-thenables that don't have .catch shorthand. This patch replaces the .catch with a rejection handler directly passed to .then method.

It won't catch exceptions from the .show method but at least it fixes what it's supposed to fix (bug 1024910).

Sorry, I didn't catch this at review time either. Thanks for the quick follow-up fix Sami.

For future reference, you can use

.then(null, () => {
  // rejection handler
})

in place of catch, so that there is a separate |then| to also catch errors from the resolve handler (the |show| method here).
