I spent lots of time yesterday trying to figure out why browser_248970_b_perwindowpb.js is leaking and I alas haven't been successful. I suggest disabling this test for now (to unblock bug 932898) as it's covering quite basic stuff that should be taken care of by other tests as well.

The test should also be rewritten, it sets, collects, and compares form data in an outdated manner and we should be able to simplify it a lot. I will file a follow-up bug to address this.
