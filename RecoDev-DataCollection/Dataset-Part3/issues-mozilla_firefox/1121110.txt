For strings like "width×height", "ms", and other hardcoded strings that we have throughout the tools, we should have a shared properties file. This, combined with ViewHelpers.L10N should make it easy to replace hardcoded strings with their localized forms.

Adds shared.properties file and replaces hardcoded occurrences of width×height in frontend with a localized version.

I tried to keep L10N usage / declarations consistent with how it was used elsewhere in the file.

Nit: have a const for the shared properties file, along with STRINGS_URI.

Needed on assertion fix in browser_canvas-frontend-img-screenshots.js (it was expecting a space between the multiplication symbol and dimensions).
