Firebug defined the de facto standard console object (see http://getfirebug.com/logging). I just confirmed that Chrome has all of those same console methods. Currently, we only support log, warn, info, error.

We need to add dir, time, timeEnd, trace, and group. The profile method should be added separately once we have a profiler.

The work for time and timeEnd will be tracked in bug 658368.
Every dependent bugs has been documented, so I consider this one as documented too.
