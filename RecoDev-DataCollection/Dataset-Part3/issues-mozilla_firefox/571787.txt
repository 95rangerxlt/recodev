For javascripts that open pop-up windows, there should be a top-border for the nav bar (since tab bar is not visible in this mode). Screenshot attached.

Javascript pop-up window (without top border)

Screenshot showing the non-existent top border.
Update your browser. There was a bug fixed where the ff button isn't supposed to be in popup windows.

This isnt about the FF button. This is about the top border of Nav Bar. See the screenshot.

It's probably caused by the FF button creating another toolbar. How old's your build?

That screenshot was from an old build. Here is another from today's build... the problem still exists...

Seems like it's because your color scheme kinda blends with it. Looks okay for me.

Compare the top border with the borders on left and right. The ones on left and right are clearly darker (real borders), while there is no border on the top. 

The reason for that is in the normal window mode when Tab Bar shows up (for Tabs on Top), the intention is not to have a border on top so that the Nav Bar blends well with the Tab Bar.... but in Pop-up windows, where there is no Tab Bar, the state should change and a border should draw on the top edge. Its a simple CSS change...
Now seems to be fixed
