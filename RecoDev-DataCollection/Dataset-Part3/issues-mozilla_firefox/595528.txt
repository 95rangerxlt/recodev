After when I mark an text in an input text field or an textarea the keyboard doesn't work anymore (write or delete text). Now i must click with the mouse into another field then the keyboard works again.

Sorry, i'm not a native English speaker.

Reproducible: Always
P.S.: In Beta 4 (i think), the error does not exist.
Solved with the new Beta version.
