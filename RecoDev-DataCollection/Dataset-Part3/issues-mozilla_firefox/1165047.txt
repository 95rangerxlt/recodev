STR:
 1. Open Browser Console (ctrl+shift+J)

 2. Click any link on the right of an error/warning.
   (For example, you could load this URL in your browser:
     data:text/html,hello
    ...and then click the "data:" link that appears to the right
    of a character encoding warning in the Browser Console.)

 3. Look at the Browser Console again, after the "view source" window appears.

ACTUAL RESULTS: This warning:
{
DEPRECATION WARNING: The arguments you're passing to viewSource.xul are using an out-of-date API.

(I hit this in current Nightly, fwiw -- 41.0a1 (2015-05-14))
We're likely to uplift bug 1025146 to 40 as foundation for view source in a tab, so this will likely need to track.

But this _should_ be a pretty straight forward migration.

jryans - did you want this? Or should I do it?
I'll look into this after my in tab work in bug 1067325.
This was fixed by the DevTools changes in bug 1067325.
