yes,it's causing crashes.
But why do you opened a bug about that here ?

There is a new beta in process.  It is almost ready to go live.

E-mail Meg at beta.piclens@gmail.com for more information.

Is there another tracking bug I missed?

Well, sent to me on the 13th April, "we hope to turn this beta into a full release version within 24-48 hours".  I'm guessing it has been delayed as I have reported several bugs.

Only other bug I think that may relate to piclens is this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=429297
Piclens has just uploaded their Firefox 3 compatibility version and it works
fine. I tested it on Fx 3.0 Beta 3 and Fx 3.0 Beta 5 on Mac & Win. So, I'm
going to mark this bug resolved.
