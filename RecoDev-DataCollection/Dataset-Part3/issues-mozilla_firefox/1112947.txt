That last instance is absolutely bug 1114541, a broken slave and nothing to do with you, the next to last probably is, and so it's extremely likely that all of them are. I'd totally ignore it unless it ever happens on not-Linux, if I were you.

So my patch for bug 1142669 made this perma orange on Linux until it was backed out. The test got slower due to excessive JIT compilation (I'm fixing that of course).

But the test will fail this way when the 10 second setTimeout below fires too soon. Using setTimeout in mochitests is strongly discouraged (see bug 649012) and we should probably update the test to stop doing that.

function waitForOutlineItems(document) {
  var deferred = Promise.defer();
  var timeout = setTimeout(() => deferred.reject(), 10000);
  var interval = setInterval(function () {
    if (document.querySelectorAll(".outlineItem").length == PDF_OUTLINE_ITEMS) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      deferred.resolve();
    }
  }, 500);

:mossop, since you reviewed the patch that originally added this test (bug 875766), I'm hoping that you can review this too.

Please note: Unfortunately I don't have access to try, so I'll need help testing this (but note that it *does* pass locally).
:mossop, Thanks for the review!

Could you please push the patch to Try for me?

Is the bc3 test bustage realted to this push ?

I don't believe it is, since the test that this patch fixes runs in bc2 (bc1 in e10s, but it's skipped there).
Also, this line in the Try push looks suspect in the bc3 failures: https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/4c5fb77ce9f0#l2.13. Given that the patch doesn't even touch that file, the failures should be unrelated to the patch as far as I can tell.
When re-reading my response in comment 25 I realise that I probably didn't express myself clearly, sorry about that!

It appears that the Try push, by mistake, modified a line in a test file that the patch in this bug does *not* actually touch.

Based on the above: can the patch be checked-in as is?
Or does it require another round of testing (in which case I'd need help with that, since I don't have Try access)?
Sorry looks like I must have had some other changes in my tree when I pushed this to try. I think you can safely ignore the bc3 failures.
Based on comment 27, I'm re-adding the checkin-needed flag.
