fixex tow problems 1.) initial problem (preference has no properties) and 2.) advanced js button stil active when js disabled

I noticed another problem: the button for the advanced js settings should be
disabled when javascript is disabled. (a regression from bug #299424
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299424)

the patch fixes both bugs, the initial one and this one.

console errors for both where:
TypeError: button has no properties
*** No preference found for pref.advanced.javascript.disable_button.advanced

We need to add this new pref to the <preferences> element, not remove it, since
that lets sysadmins lock down the panel.

- added the new pref to the <preferences> element instead of removing it (sry,
didn't noticed that)

You need to ask for review from someone specifically, otherwise it won't be
noticed.
