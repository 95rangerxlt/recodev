We have a stub installer for en-US from bug 322206, but I don't see them built for l10n repacks.

They're not on ftp, and I don't see trace of them in the repack log either.

Correct. We are getting the en-US done first and will take care of this after I have some breathing room.
Not blocking for deployment, although we need to do this to deploy with localized builds.

Kyle, it isn't clear to me where the best place to do this is so if I am way off be nice. :)

This seems hackish, but i guess this is good enough. I'd like Pike to take a look, though.
I won't have time for a thorough review anytime soon, sorry.
Maybe Benjamin Smedberg can review this

I was able to run the extra checks performed on the build system (didn't know there was a MOZ_PKG_PRETTYNAMES verification build step) and was able to fix up the patch. I'm running it through try

This works locally for me but for some reason the try build didn't get the quoting.
I don't recall the exact when-which, but there is a pattern on when to use ESCAPE_WILDCARD, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=ESCAPE_WILDCARD. Maybe this is a spot.
This could also be related to bug 794472, which i'm going to land today.

I'm an ID10T. Not sure if the patch in bug 794472 made a difference but I should have realized that the dir might not exist yet.

For good measure, you may want to quote the path here too.

Since it passes l10n build checks, we can try this out on Aurora (18) and back out later if anything unexpected regresses.

Definitely a lot of problems with this patch. I'm finding the l10n stub builds on http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-l10n/ and http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-aurora-l10n/, however, such problems seen so far include:

- The stub installer l10n executables are not signed builds in each directory. This is different behavior than what's seen with the full installer l10n executables, as they are signed builds
- The stub installer l10n builds on the central and aurora directories are using wrong artwork, wrong release channels, etc. This doesn't make sense, as these l10n stub executables should be for nightly and aurora for latest-mozilla-central and latest-mozilla-aurora respectively. Instead, I'm getting 16.02 release stub executables in each directory
- None of these stub executables appear to have localized strings at all. All of the wording shown is in english.

Brian - Any ideas? What's going on here?
It sounds like 2 problems.

I'm setting this too. I think RelEng needs to sign the stub because the full alongside the stub is being signed correctly.

I'm seeing this for both full installers and stub installers. I tested with the French builds. I think this is an l10n problem in general and not specific to the stub work here.  The branding is always Firefox specific.

If I go to file properties on the stub itself says 18.0a2. But when I install from the stub on these localized builds I'm seeing the same thing with 16.  Sounds like the same problem as above.  The branding is Firefox so it grabs the Firefox full installer when downloading.

> - None of these stub executables appear to have localized strings at all.
> All of the wording shown is in english.

The wording on the installers themselves are localized (checked with French builds). I think the download link it is pointing to is not yet correct though.  So again I think this is the same problem.
Bug 804090 is the branding bug.

The localization is due to the lcale not being localized on aurora yet. Look at the ar locale to see a localized stub that also happens to be RTL.

The signing will need to be worked out though I am not familiar with how we accomplish that for l10n, etc. I suspect someone from releng can help out with that.
It may be best to post a separate bug for RelEng to investigate signing the new stub l10n executables.

And for the second bug, Rob gave the link.  Most of the symptoms you mentioned, other than signing, would be fixed by that bug.
Sounds good. I've filed bug 806280 for the l10n signed builds.
