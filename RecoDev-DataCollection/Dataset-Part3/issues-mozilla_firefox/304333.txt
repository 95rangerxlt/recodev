Reading through the help it's probably not necessary to change anything.

The only potentially needed change would be to:

      By default &brandShortName; automatically checks for updates to itself as
      well as to extensions and themes so you'll always know you have the most
      up-to-date version. 

To prehaps:

      By default &brandShortName; automatically checks for updates to itself as
      well as to extensions and themes, and search engines so you'll always know
                  
      you have the most up-to-date version. 

However the grammer of that sentance doesn't work and it doesn't read well, so
the best option is probably to leave it as is.

"and to search engines"

I wasn't sure whether or not to capitalize or not search engines, since
extensions and themes are lower-case.
Patch checked in on both branch and trunk.
