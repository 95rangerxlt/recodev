From phlsa:  The buttons are very large relative to the size of the tile. Given that the 99.9% case for the user is *not* to click on those buttons, we should consider shrinking them. I tried quickly scaling them to 70% which works quite well (http://cl.ly/image/2h2P2G103938).

The current icons are 32x32, so 70% would be 22.4. What size should it be? 24? 22? These are SVG, so we can scale it to whatever we want.

Let's use 22px then.
Note to people wanting to take this bug:

The code is scattered across browser/themes/shared/newtab (CSS and SVGs) and browser/base/content/newtab (JavaScript and XML source). Let me know if you need more help, either in a comment here or on IRC.

Didn't change gear, debatable, like it the way it is. 

Didn't change the .svg files to keep rescaling easier in future

LGTM, though are you going to resize the gear in a different patch?

I won't be able to grant review+ for this patch, but someone else can.

Suggested patch

dcrobot says the gear should be 27px and phlsa says tile buttons 22px. Although for the tile buttons, there's a shadow so 24px could be fine and 28px for similar svg spacing?

nit: space after the ":"

Also, could probably move the background-size to the .newtab-control and explicitly background-size: auto for sponsored although that icon be removed soon with bug 1040369.

What Ed said in comment 5, including moving background-size.

And apparently we want the gear at 27px?
I agree that the pin should have been smaller. I made it 24 px specifically after the older versions which were pretty fine. 

One of the reasons 'pin' looks better when smaller is that it obstructs the background less. That is not true in case of the gear. My opinion is that the gear should be left as it is.

Whether we want the pin to 22/24/26 is still open to discussion.
Ok, over to UX then.
24 pixels is fine with me.

> 24 pixels is fine with me.

What about the gear icon?
The gear icon should be 28 x 28
Kumar, you can create the patch ignoring newtab-control-sponsored as I'm removing it in bug 1040369. And dcrobot says the gear should be 28px.

Is the auto necessary? You don't have it below for the 24px controls and it seems to work. Also nit: space after the ":".

You should be able to set the background-size here...

... then override it here.. I think?

Sorry I wasn't more explicit in my previous comment: "... then override it here," but the sponsored control isn't using the svg file, so the background size needs to be of the original controls.png height/width instead of being overridden by the newly added "background-size: 24px;"

You can test if the sponsored icon is showing up correctly by creating a new profile.

screenshot of v3 (background-size: 32px;)

Here's what it looks like with background-size: 32px with controls.png for the sponsored button.

in .newtab-control-sponsored, setting background-size to auto does the job. In fact, I tried all other combinations. This is the only option that works.
Also, the lines 200/201 i.e. width and height setting in .newtab-control-sponsored is overridden by another css property to be 14px. Should I remove it altogether?
