*** Bug 1063846 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
IME does not support e10s yet, so we'd (temporarily) like to disable e10s if IME is enabled.

Is this possible? Can IME be toggled on/off while Firefox is running?
This bug should be fixed for the e10s M2 milestone.
does it have to actually be turned off or just inaccessible?

Looks like we're going to black list languages

   HKL locales[30];
   int count = 30;
   int result = 0;
   result = GetKeyboardLayoutList(count, locales);
   printf ("ANAAKTGE result is %d\n", result);
   for (int i=0; i<result; i++) {
      printf ("0x%x isIME = %d \n",locales[i],  ImmIsIME(locales[i]));
       //http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318693%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
       // maybe blacklist cjk
       // last 4 hex, last 8 bits  & 0xFF
       // fold into patch for felipe
   }
Whenever you want to input with IME, you can use it in any locales. So, I don't understand what you want to do in this bug.

We need to fix all bugs which blocks users to use Nightly comfortable before enabling e10s in the default settings...
This bug is a giant/hack bandaid for the crash-landing e10s on Nightly for a few days *this* week (orders came from on high). Then it'll get flipped off.

The idea is that if we detect any of this set of languages that need imes (cjk), to then start the browser in single process firefox where ime works.

Other, better ideas are welcome (this is afterall a very sucky hack), but we have til friday.

Yes, that means bad things if a user switches on ime during a running e10s firefox, bad things happen.

I had sent you some mail with related questions earlier this week.

Masayuki: Andreas would like to enable e10s for a couple days of testing very soon (perhaps next week). We know major features (like IME, a11y, and printing) will be broken during the test days, so we are trying to disable e10s for configurations that we know won't work.(In reply to :ally Allison Naaktgeboren from comment #6)

Ally: for these test days, would it be safer to whitelist e10s just for, say, en-* locales?

So, this is very bad. And please note that currently, TSF is enabled in Nightly. It's a new IME framework of Windows and also used for hand-writing system and speech input. Similarly, on GTK build, IME is used for hand-writing system of tablet.

Yeah, I'll check it. I'm back from summer vacation right now.

IIRC, fixing bug 975260 is temporarily enough Nightly testers to test e10s mode with IME. Why don't you ping him in it?

How about tablet PCs?

Thanks. I'll ping Makoto.

Good point. The ideal solution is to postpone our e10s test until these bugs are all fixed, but the faster "fix" might be to programatically detect tablet PCs so we can disable e10s. <:)

Bill & I talked about that, plus european languages, but decided against it when the list got too long.

Like I said, I'm open to better ideas, but the deadline is fast approaching.
:blassey indicates that tablets are  not a concern for the m2 crashland
I realized that GTK and Mac use IME for implementing dead keys. Does it work on both platforms?
If fixing NS_QUERY_TEXT_RECT bug 975260 is good enough for Nightly testing, then this bug doesn't need to block our M2 milestone.
fwiw, I've been told to finish the patch as a backup. I fervently hope we don't have to land it.
so has the landing of 975270 fix m-c enough that we can wontfix this one?

30 and 10? Match these up. Maybe we should query GetKeyboardLayoutList for the actual number, then allocation the buffer dynamically?

I'll try to check this today or tomorrow. But if you will add the patch, it's better.

Hmm, this check cannot help for some specific environments. When we need to check if a keyboard layout is an IME, I *guess* we should use ITfInputProcessorProfileMgr. If you want an utility method for it, I'll *try* to create it and check the behavior.

r- due to the feedback we're waiting on from masayuki, plus review nits.
Jim: IIUC, in comment 21, I think Masayuki recommended landing Ally's patch until the fix in bug 975270 is shown to be adequate.
On Windows, TSF mode doesn't work fine. Bug 966157? Looks like IMM mode almost works.

On GTK (Ubuntu 14.04), both iBus and SCIM work fine to me.

On Mac (Mavericks), Japanese IMEs work fine.
Ok, sounds like we still need this on Windows. Ally, can we get an updated patch with review nits addressed?
damn. ok

I am ashamed to put my name & Jim's on this patch.

Jim, I can't dynamically allocate the buffer because I have to give the buffer to GetKeyboardLayoutList to get the number of keyboard layouts(int result in this patch). This is clearly very old C style.

You need to 

#if defined(XP_WIN)

this code block and move isIME above so it's valid on all platforms for use in the final check.

Hi, could you provide a try link for this change, thanks!
This is probably bit rotted by the patch in bug Bug 1068199, but it should be easy to touch up. Also, I forgot to mention in the review, in the updated patch please add a comment above the main block explaining what we're doing here.
Can we wait a few hours before landing this? It occurred to me last night that this patch will make it impossible for anyone who has any CJK keyboard layouts installed to test e10s, even if they know what they're getting into. I don't want to lose Alice0775 White as a tester :-).

I'll post something in a bit.

This patch makes it so that:

- If we detect IME, we don't ask the user to enable e10s on startup (although the damage is probably mostly already done here...)
- If the browser.tabs.remote.autostart.1 pref is set (see bug 1058358) then we won't actually enable e10s if IME is enabled.

However, the user can still turn on e10s via browser.tabs.remote.autostart.

One problem with this patch, which it shares with the a11y disabling patch, is that the "Enable E10S" box in prefs is checked if browser.tabs.remote.autostart.1 is checked, even if IME is present. I don't think this is a huge concern. It would be kind of a pain to fix, since the behavior of the checkbox is already pretty complex.
