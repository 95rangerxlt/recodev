v.1 Set the effect to "none" and flush before setting an effect

There was nothing to trigger the effect again if the specified effect was the same as the current highlight. This is for the case where you simply want to move a highlight without calling hideHighlight in between. This was brought to my attention by :agibson.

The workaround is to always call hideHighlight before a showHighlight so this is P5.

Holy gaping hole in the web api, batman.
Agreed, having to think about layout flushes as a web developer feels dirty to me.
