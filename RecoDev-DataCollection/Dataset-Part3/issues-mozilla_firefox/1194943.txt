On Windows 8 we use the same hardcoded border color as on Windows Vista and 7 for the default state, but strangely not the accompanying colors for :hover and [focused]. This patch removes this inconsistency.

Alternatively, we could make Windows 8 use the Windows 10 styling. I think this would actually make sense but it would be a more radical change from what we've been doing on Windows 8.

Review of attachment 8648347:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Code-wise, this looks excellent.

Visually, I'm not entirely convinced. I rather liked the darker blue for the focused state. It also seems like it matches the hover state for the toolbarbuttons on the bookmarks bar (caused by moz-appearance: toolbarbutton, so not entirely sure what the colors are there and judging purely by eye) better. Is that just me? Maybe check in with Philipp/Steven?

I don't think we should over-rotate on this. Windows 8 should soon be a walking dead thanks to the free and aggressive Win10 upgrade. Generally I think our quality on 8 will benefit from treating it like 7 or 10 where appropriate rather than having special treatment that engineers and testers are increasingly unlikely to dogfood.
Philipp, do you have thoughts on this? Should we use the URL and search bar's hover and focused styling we introduced for Windows 10 on Windows 8 too? If not, I think we should align it with the Windows 7 style as done by my patch; this would be a rather subtle change from what we're currently doing on Windows 8.

Here's another option. The focus color hardcoded for 7 is very close to the native Highlight color, so by just using that we can get the desired blue shades across the board.

Yes, I prefer this. Thanks!

(I also ran into bug 1010676 when reviewing this, and I wonder if we should port the fix you wrote in bug 550366 to the new-style customization mode, because bug 559561 doesn't seem to be getting too much traction...)
