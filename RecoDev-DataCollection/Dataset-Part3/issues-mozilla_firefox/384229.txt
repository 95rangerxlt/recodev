Screen-readers are not reading the labels associated with the search and location boxs in FF3.  This could be because the labels don't exist.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.
Press ctrl+l

2. If you wish, press tab to get to the search box.
3.
Actual Results:  
You hear the type of field, i.e. edit or edit combo, but not it's name.


Expected Results:  
Same  behavior as FF2.  Upon pressing ctrl+l you should hear "Location" foby the field type.  Pressing ttab should yield "search."

Sorry for the mess.  I'll clean up once I go back to FF2.

Fix nsHTMLTextFieldAccessible() so that XUL parent's name is reused for it, 2) Provide nice accessible name for <searchbox> e.g. "Search Google"

I guess... note we didn't do this for the grayed-out text in this field because of engines like "MSN Search"; for the screen-reader case that's still better though.

please add the readonly attribute to your getter, r=me otherwise.
