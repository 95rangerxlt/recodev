marking fixed, but it would be nice to verify it on the three platforms
Just some humble questions, since these changes makes it harder to maintain the
keyboard shortcut list:

Why is all this needed? Wouldn't it be better if Ctrl+I opened Page Info on all
platforms? I know IE uses Ctrl+I for their Favorites sidebar, but who uses that
shortcut? 

And on Linux, is Ctrl+K to "kill end of line" a global Linux shortcut or just an
Emacs shortcut? If it's the latter, why on earth do we want to break consistency
because of a special shortcut in an advanced text editor?

I think its more or less global. Ctrl-K works in bash, csh, konqueror, mozilla.
It didn't work in nautilus (gnome's file manager). I think we should keep it.

Also, I second the motion of having Ctrl-I map to Page Info on Windows.
AFAIK, ctrl+K is only used in emacs (and derivatives) and most shells (ksh being
the only exception that I know of).

That being said, I think it would be better to have the shortcut be the same on
all platforms.
Different key bindings between Linux and Windows is something that falls into my
"seriously" annoying category, and is the main reason I tend not to use
Moz/Firebird for Win. I expect the same program to behave very close to the
same. IMO, different bindings on differing platforms = broken. Why must we
conform to emacs key bindings if we're not an editor? 

Would it be possible to "theme" key bindings? Then users could customize themes
to be IE, Emacs, konq, etc. and get their preferred emulation.

This site has information that is only correct for Windows:
http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/keyboard.html

Since this site is linked to from mozilla.org, it should probably be updated
with information for all three platforms. It would prevent the filing of invalid
bugs, such as bug 232153.
The "Why use Firebird" page also refers to Ctrl-K as the key for moving to the
search bar. 

http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/why/

It would be appropiate to have these as standard across all platforms. 
Isn't 2004 supposed to be the year of the Linux desktop ? It would be nice if
switchers from Windows had the same keybinding

I was happy to find that other readline bindings: ctrl-w (kill word), ctrl-a
(line beginning), ctrl-e ( endof line), ctrl-u (kill to bol) also work in
text-boxes. In fact, adding ctrl-y (yank) wouldn't be so bad either ;-)  (It's
duplicated by the current ctrl-z though).

I'd consider it a documentation bug that these bidings aren't included in the
"Firefox Keyboard Shortcuts" page of the help. Especially so because these
bindings have different meanings inside and outside text-boxes!
This drove me quite nuts.  I've been using firefox on a windows box at work and
got used to ctrl+k.  Just installed it under linux at home, and ctrl+k didn't
work.  The clincher - I actually RTFM (aka help) and it lists ctrl+k as the
shortcut for the search bar.  The help file for linux needs to be updated.
