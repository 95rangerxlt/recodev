ts / txul regression from bug #406094

I was not expecting anything, and looking over the patch, I'm not seeing what could have caused it yet.

locally, txul doesn't seem to have regressed.

I'll investigate tomorrow morning and backout or fix.

Thanks to reed for the heads up.

note the supplimental fix for bug #405231 would need to be backed out, too.

	reed	er, was that expected to regress perf?
        sspitzerMsgMe	where?
	reed	see Linux perf
	reed	Ts shot up
	reed	and Txul
	reed	before: Ts:891ms; after: Ts:905ms
	reed	before: Txul:212ms; after: Txul:219ms
	reed	talking about bug 406094
	reed	or do you think it's a box problem?
	reed	could wait to see what happens to win32 and mac
	sspitzerMsgMe	hmm, I was not expecting any txul / ts from that
	sspitzerMsgMe	looking...
	reed	mac's high, too
	reed	:/
	sspitzerMsgMe	investigating.

the only ts problem could be for this.ensurePlacesDefaultQueriesInitialized(); but that makes a simple check on a pref value, and if it's true it returns. Could this be caused by the concurrent checkin of change to the createddefaultqueries pref?

pal-moz on the mozillazine forum reported that the new smart bookmarks folder has not replaces the old Places folder, i think that that could cause a txul (http://img263.imageshack.us/my.php?image=sbrc8.jpg)

does the build machine use a new profile?
since importbookmarkshtml is always true until a bookmarks.html is imported, the 

    else {
      // this covers the case the places database gets corrupted (or removed)
      // but the bookmarks html backup file does not exist
      this.ensurePlacesDefaultQueriesInitialized();
    }

is always executed, but there is no other way to understand if places.sqlite has been replaced since other prefs are already been fixed by the places core start. 

the else should be

else if ( check to see if places.sqlite has been replaced ) {
      // this covers the case the places database gets corrupted (or removed)
      // but the bookmarks html backup file does not exist
      this.ensurePlacesDefaultQueriesInitialized();
    }

the only pref that could be check is the leftpanefolderid (should still be -1), but i don't think that nsbrowserglue is the right place to refer to that pref
alternatively, if bookmarks.html does not exists set importbookmarkshtml to false (in the else clause)

this way however will not allow a user to put a bookmarks.html at any time, without setting the importbookmarkshtml to true
oops, i noticed now that if bookmarkshtml is false the ensurecreateddefaultqueries is still executed in 

    if (!importBookmarks) {
      // Call it here for Fx3 profiles created before the Places folder
      // has been added, otherwise it's called during import.
      this.ensurePlacesDefaultQueriesInitialized();
      return;
    }

so the case touching up the TS should be:
- importbookmarkshtml is true (default until a bookmarks.html is found)
- bookmarks.html does not exists

imho, a new profile will always fall in this case, the supplimental check to createdsmartbookmarks pref will affect TS
I backed out the patch from bug 406094 since it is causing a perf regression and because MaK77 has found some other problems with it.
thanks for backing me out, reed.

I've landed a new version of Marco's fix for bug #406094, and I'm watching tinderbox

(I haven't been able to reproduce the ts txul problem locally.)

I'll log a spin off issue on the nsBrowserGlue.js change that didn't make it in (and the scenario for why we want it) and refer back to this bug about potential Ts / Txul issues.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
