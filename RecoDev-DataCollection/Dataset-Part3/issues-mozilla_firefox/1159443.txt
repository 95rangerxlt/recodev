Found in today's nightly build (40.0a1 (2015-04-28)).

I updated to today's nightly build and set the required flags and restarted Firefox. Then I signed into the dev pocket server and tried clicking the Pocket button in my toolbar, but my item doesn't get saved to my Pocket list.

This worked in yesterday's integration build, so something is a bit off w/ the Nightly build today.

Maybe the nightly got built before the fx-team -> mozilla-central merge. Could you please try again with the next nightly?
Seems to be working now on 40.0a1 (2015-04-29)
