Both control + <number> and command + <number> are switching tabs, when there is
a tab opened matching <number>, instead of activating the accesskey.

Tab switching is handled by command + <number> on Macs. Accesskey activation has
always been control + <accesskey>. 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page with numbers as accesskeys
2. Open a few tabs
3. Use control + <accesskey>



Actual Results:  
Tab switching occurs.

Expected Results:  
Accesskey activation.

Aaron, is metaKey both command and control on Mac?

meta is just command.
note: only cmd+[1-9] keyboard shortcuts switch tabs, at least here ;)

That's correct. I should have been more clear.

So, what's the bug?

duh.... sorry folks, I misread the above.


cmd+[1-9] should switch tabs. ctl+[1-9] should activate accesskeys.

The bug is: ctl+[1-9] switches tabs when it should be activating accesskeys. If
there is no accesskey[1-9] on a page then nothing should happen when presing
ctl+[1-9].

I see this bug on 2 different installs of FF 0.10
This bug really has to go away as it severely harms web applications that rely on number accesskeys. In 
our application we use it for addressing internal sections that are permanently used and flipped and FF 
1.0RC1 behaviour is disastrous as it totally breaks the accessibility of the page.

CMD-Number switching is okay. Mapping CTRL at all on the Mac is just evil. Please remove this asap. 
We'd be migrating back to Mozilla Suite if this would stay in.
er, we don't have Ctrl mapped to this at all.  I don't think we have
Ctrl-anything mapped explicitly.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/base/content/browser.js#1058
is the code in question, it uses metaKey (Cmd) as the trigger on Mac, Alt on
other UNIX platforms, and Ctrl on everything else (i.e. Windows).

So I'm not sure what's going on with you, but it shouldn't be working if it is.
Don't know too much about other platforms but on the Mac CTRL is the de-facto modifier for 
accesskeys. Safari and all WebKit/WebCore browsers are using it. ALT is a general modifier to type all 
kinds of special characters and CMD is the general command key and the only one that makes sense for 
switching tabs. CTRL should be used for accesskeys.

It would be even better to have it configurable but as long there is no configuration opportunity, CTRL 
is the way to go and no other programs functions should reroute CTRL key combinations.
restating in simpler terms: The code uses Cmd on Mac, Ctrl on non-UNIX, and Alt
on UNIX.  End of story.

Ctrl shouldn't work.  Period.

To make it even more clear _Ctrl works on mac ff_ for *accesskeys*. For tab 
navigation (by numbers) the keybinding is Cmd+1-9.
Pretty sad this bug is still in Firefox 1.0 final.

It totally disables the use of 0-9 shorcuts on Mac OS X.
The behaviour of Firefox is abolutely correct if only one tab is open. In this
case CTRL + Number really acts as accesskey. But as soon as there are more than
one tab all numbers where tabs exist act as tab switcher. If there are 2 Tabs
open CTRL + 2 no longer acts as accesskey but switches tabs. This behaviour is
not correct. I would expect CTRL + number to always act as accesskey no matter
how many tabs are opened.
By chance are you guys using any sort of tab extensions?  There has to be some
reason why keys that aren't bound in the code are somehow working for you.
I /think/ comment 13 isn't related (using windows?)
The problem as I describe it is the behaviour under Mac OS X. I am not using any
sort of tab extension. Nevertheless I disabled all extensions but the problem is
still there.

Yeah, we suck that much.
The patch solves the problem.

Thank you very much :)
