This is actually to do with the fact that we add/remove flex from the parent node, but bug 899576 hardcoded the added flex on the toolbar rather than the customization target, which means we remove flex from the customization target, which leads to all the weirdness.

Personally, I think we should just remove all the flex logic, for which see bug 900593. In this case, the simple patch is swapping the flex attributes of the customization target and the nav-bar (1 and 501, respectively). Trivial patch in a second.
