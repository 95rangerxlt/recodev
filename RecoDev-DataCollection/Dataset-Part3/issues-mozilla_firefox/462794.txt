I've been seeing this on my machine all the time.  The following command:

python runtests.py --browser-chrome --test-path=browser/components/sessionstore

would start the test and the main browser window would close along the way.  Removing the tests from the Makefile one by one, I once saw this happen with only browser_454908.js in the suite, but I've seen this happen with several other ones even after removing browser_454908.js...

I think Aaron might have some experience with this problem as well, as he wrote the tests for bug 248970.
Can you post some steps to replicate? I have not had this happen.

Like explained in comment 0, here are the STRs:

cd obj-dir/_tests/testing/mochitest
python runtests.py --browser-chrome --test-path=browser/components/sessionstore
Were you using a clean profile for every test run? The test for bug 454908 could close the browser window if browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo has been incorrectly set to 0.

Hmmm, I didn't do anything special in this regard...  Isn't a clean profile created for each run of chrome tests automatically?
I'm not sure. I just noted that what's more probably the cause is a single blank tab (instead of a tab with the homepage loaded) which is then automatically closed by undoCloseTab. Could it be that you accidentally blanked the first tab during your testing?

This might be it!  On my system, the home page in the testing profile is always about:blank.

I also verified that a new profile is created for each run of browser chrome tests.
Created attachment 346073
make tests take a single blank page into account

This should make the two affected tests more reliable when the testing environment doesn't use a homepage.

Thanks for the patch, Simon.  Works great!
Maybe we should set browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab to false for the tests?
