listenManual=Firefox can allow remote debugging over a TCP/IP connection. For security reasons this is turned off by default, but can be enabled using this command.

All hardcoded instances of Firefox were removed in recent bugs.

Patch fixing hardcoded Firefox

This patch should work, unfortunately I can't test it locally since the current nightly doesn't have the "listen" command yet.

Asking review to :dcamp based on the commit comment (even if I don't see him in bug 839862's patch review)
