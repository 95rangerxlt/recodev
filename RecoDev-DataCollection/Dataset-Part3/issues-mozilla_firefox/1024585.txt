In bug 995417, we are attempting to outlaw connecting to non-local hostnames during tests.  browser_cmd_inject.js explicitly connects to ajax.googleapis.com, resulting in failure with the patches from bug 995417 applied:

09:57:00     INFO -  Non-local network connections are disabled and a connection attempt to ajax.googleapis.com was made.  You should only access hostnames available via the test networking proxy (if running mochitests) or from a test-specific httpd.js server (if running xpcshell tests).
09:57:00     INFO -  TEST-INFO | Main app process: exit status 80000003
09:57:00  WARNING -  TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/devtools/commandline/test/browser_cmd_inject.js | application terminated with exit code 2147483651

This test should be changed to use local test files only.

I decided to remove the offending test case first to unblock bug 995417. I will address injecting a test js file and testing if the function was added in a separate bug.
That way to stop the test running works just fine.

It's worth mentioning some alternatives when you want to stop a test running:
This is the normal way:

Also for GCLI commands you can use skipIf and skipRemainingIf:

http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/commandline/test/browser_gcli_exec.js#160
http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/commandline/test/browser_gcli_pref1.js#48
Also, I make that 59 mins from initial filing to patch - nice work.
Thanks for the rapid response!
