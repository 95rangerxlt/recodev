Add-on Compatibility Reporter 2.0.3 is installed.

On 32, the addon page does not show report buttons for compatibility issues.

I cannot of course test in safe mode/empty mode since this is an addon issue.

I cannot of course report the problem via the compatibility reporter.

I did recently get a make a report pop-up, which is useless since it disappears as soon as you try to test anything.

It works on 29.

Would you like to help and find a regression range (when this started to happen)? There is a tool called mozregression for that - https://quality.mozilla.org/docs/bugzilla/guide-to-triaging-bugs-for-firefox/finding-a-regression-window/
Unless I'm misunderstanding, which I often do, it may be intentional due to:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=760356 Only show the add-on compatibility UI when actually necessary
Which UI.  I'm talking about the report button in the addon's page created by the add-on compatibility reporter, not the check at upgrade.

It makes no sense to me to assume, at least in a testing situation, that some add-on's are OK and can't possibly need a report.

I'll try to find the date of change.  It appears bug 760356 was only fixed today or yesterday.
The "report issue" button for each add-on entry appears in the 5/16 nightly and no in the 5/17 nightly.
