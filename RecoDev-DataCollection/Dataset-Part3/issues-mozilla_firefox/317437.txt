It's a pain in the posterior to have to use methods with out params all the time from script. Methods in nsINavHistory.idl make this problem worse. 

getSourceQuery should be replaced by:

void getSourceQueries([retval, array, size_is(aResultCount)] out nsINavHistoryQuery aQueries, out PRUint32 aResultCount);

and

readonly attribute nsINavHistoryQueryOptions sourceQueryOptions;

... so that script code can do:

var queries = result.getSourceQueries({ });
for (var i = 0; i < queries.length; ++i) {
..
}

and

var options = result.sourceQueryOptions;

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
