Build ID: 20110902072738

Steps to reproduce:

Whenever I close a tab in Nightly, before the tab actually closes it will show the tab I am trying to close for a quick second before it will actually close it. This is only if you're on a different tab to the one you're trying to close.


Actual results:

I have explained in the above paragraph.


Expected results:

It shouldn't have shown the tab I was closing at all.

Does the issue still occur if you start Firefox in Safe Mode? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode

How about with a new, empty profile? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic%20Troubleshooting#w_8-make-a-new-profile

I'm getting this too, it's probably because of the fix for bug 679255.

I have just got done trying it in both safe mode & a new profile and the bug still persists. And according to the comment above this one I'm not the only person with this problem. Thanks for the reply.

I think I see what you mean - it does briefly appear to change to the tab before closing

patch

I tried to write a test for this, but it's a pain since tabbrowser.xml uses setTimeout in addTab() to show the close button and tabbox.xml uses setTimeout in the mousedown handler.

Note that there's another drawback from 679255's landing. Right-click on the active tab focuses the tab itself occasionally, showing the dotted lines.
