When we expire visits for a page, we reset the frecency to -1 because potentially we cleared out all its visits. But we don't need to be so aggressive in resetting because we can check if the place still has visits and/or bookmarks. If so, we can reuse the frecency as a better estimate than just -1.

Patch is part of bug 417810.
