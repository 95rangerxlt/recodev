I'm using windows XP Service pack 1 and am logged in as an administrator.  The
XP themes service is turned on.  Firebird is set to be my default browser and is
using the default theme.  I am also able to reproduce this bug on a friend's
computer with windows 2000.  The error does not occur in mozilla 1.5 or in a
linux build of firebird.  When I navigate to the given url or refresh the window
an Internet Explorer window opens with a document containing some fragments of
vbscript code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to URL

Actual Results:  
An internet explorer window opens with the following content: <HTML><SCRIPT
LANGUAGE=vbscript>var __w=[code];if(__w!=null)document.write(__w);</SCRIPT></HTML> 



Since this bug opens internet explorer which is less likely to be kept up to
date by a firebird user it might be possible to use this to open an internet
explorer window and exploit unpatched vulnerabilities there.

This was fixed for Seamonkey in bug 163648.  Maybe the prefs just need to be
copied over.
Clearing confidential flag since bug 163648 is public and Firefox is an obvious
next thing to test. This is fixed by bsmedberg's pref-unification changes that
made the 'birds pick up the default GRE prefs.
