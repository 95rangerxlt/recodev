STR:
* Open 2 chats.
* Focus the first chat you opened.
* Optional: move focus to URL bar or similar.
* Press Accel+Shift+C - the keyboard shortcut to focus the chatbar.

Actual:
* Focus is moved from the first opened chat to the second.

Expected:
* Focus remains in the previously focused first chat.

If you use the sidebar to click on a user and select a different chat, then this new chat always gets the new focus.  IOW, it isn't actually the "most recently opened" chat that always gets focus, it's the "most recently selected via the sidebar" chat which does.

FWIW, while I can see the second chat get focus in this case, I can't see where we actually set focus.  Is it possible the facebook content is managing to shift focus?

When using the keyboard shortcut, the focus is set by http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/diff/cd2b8f31f59b/browser/base/content/browser-social.js. I do believe that the Facebook content is also calling element.focus() after onload.

Patch

This patch returns focus to the selected chat when the keyboard shortcut is used.

Patch v1.1

After talking on IRC, I updated this patch to not adjust focus if there aren't any chatboxes in the DOM. If there are, then selectedChat will be non-null.
