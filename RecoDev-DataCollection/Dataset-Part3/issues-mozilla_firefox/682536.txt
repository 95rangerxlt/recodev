For example, the case of people taking advantage of the great Firefox strength in customisability of moving many UI items onto the same bar as the back/forward button, would this detect and prevent such customised UI elements from jumping? I don't want to see this blowing up into more negative tech press.
This is indeed an annoying side effect, plus the sliding is jerky for me.

I don't think UI elements should move without a good reason (like tab reordering), this is very visually distracting.
This is happening now on Nightly-Windows (10/11/2011) with a clean profile.

With a fresh profile this still resizes the search bar until you manually resize the urlbar/searchbar splitter. I noticed the same thing on the Windows and OSX versions.

Is there any way around that?

That's expected as far as this patch is concerned. Bug 694084 covers the rest.
