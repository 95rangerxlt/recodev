patch 1

what happens if the tree panel isn't open?

We probably need a more generic method than the one in treePanel (deleteChildBox).

Not sure to understand.

The deleteNode function does 2 things:
1) delete the node from the document.
2) delete the node from the tree panel.

If deleteNode is called if the tree panel is closed, there's no reason to delete the node from the tree panel.
ok, my bad. Carry on. :)
