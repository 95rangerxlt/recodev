The URL and the exact steps to reproduce are necessary.
The problem persists in safe mode with addons disabled.
Where is the link to open a captcha in a 2nd window?

Please, provide clear STR to save our time.
STR:
1) load the given URL
2) click on "login" at the top right
3) use "testcc@mailinator.com" and "123456" to login
4) load the given URL again
5) click on the big "enter" under "walmart"
6) click the "submit" button
7) a CSS "popup" with a captcha should open but it's empty.

I can confirm the issue with Firefox and that it's working in Firefox16.0.1
Matthias, thanks for the STR.
But it's only broken in FF17, it works fine in FF18+ (see http://i.imgur.com/6NQSz.jpg), so I guess the regression is already fixed and this bug is a dupe.

Sorry that I forgot to mention that it's already fixed on trunk.
I had no time to dig deeper in this issue, thanks for doing the regression search.
We are at beta1 at the moment ?
There is a good chance that the fix will be in beta2.
Yes, only 17b1 at the moment.
It would be helpful to find a smaller regression range and/or when this was fixed. Anthony - can you help with that?

Jet - I think this bug is in your wheelhouse. Let me know if I'm wrong. Also CC'ing roc just in case.
CSS pop-up content shows in 17.0b2 and does not in 17.0b1. I'm guessing something was uplifted that fixed this.

Pushlog between 17b1 and 17b2:

Using the tinderbox builds I think the regression range is between the following changesets.

Suspected fixed by bug 786740 - Fix invalidations on out-of-flow frames (roc,r=cwiiis,a=lsblakk)
So it's fixed on 17 now. We can close this bug, then?
Yes, it's a dupe of bug 786740.
Okay.  So, if the fix is in 17b2, how can I get a copy of it?

I don't know the exact release date for beta2 but it should be soon, Your beta1 build will update to beta2 and the issue should be gone.
Our current plan is to release Firefox 17.0b2 on Monday, October 22nd. If you simply want to test that this is fixed, you can grab the candidate build from here:
