Expression closures (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) are a nonstandard language extension we'd like to remove from SpiderMonkey.

In browser-fullZoom.js, I believe this only affects the following handleResult method:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/0b3c520002ad/browser/base/content/browser-fullZoom.js#l165

The general pattern is that 'function (x) y' should be replaced with 'function (x) { return y; }'. However, I don't think we actually want handleResult to return something, so the 'return' statement should be omitted.

I would like to work on this.

Please go ahead and let me know if you have questions.
Hello Dão, Should the handleResult methods on lines 234 and 498 be replaced as well?

Yeah, looks like I missed them earlier. Good catch!
Ok great, hopefully I'll get the patch in by this afternoon. This will be my first!

Looks good, just two minor things: Can you please add a space after { and before } and a semicolon after hasPref = true?

>-      handleResult: function (resultPref) value = resultPref.value,
>+      handleResult: function (resultPref) {value = resultPref.value},

same here

>-      handleResult: function (pref) value = pref.value,
>+      handleResult: function (pref) {value = pref.value},

and here too
Sure thing, Thanks!
