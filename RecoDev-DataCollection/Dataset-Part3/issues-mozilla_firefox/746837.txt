This should probably just be calling browser.focus()?
Maybe!  I don't have any idea what I'm really doing here ...

'browser' is the tabbrowser here. It should be renamed accordingly, 'let browser = tabbrowser.getBrowserForTab(tab);' should be added and then we can focus the browser in the callback function.

better patch?

It seems that we don't even need the setTimeout anymore. This doesn't regress bug 342432 comment 6.

Make this `tab.linkedBrowser` and we have a deal.

Indeed, as of the great focus rewrite (somewhere between 3.5 and 4, I forget when) focusing the browser is the way to go (except in certain unrelated cases where you specifically want to raise the window at the same time).
