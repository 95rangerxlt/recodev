Antonio: Could you provide TalkBack incident ID?
(please ignore my previous comment)

Antonio wrote me by e-mail: 
Well, I prepared a scenario for you guys to do some testing. I noticed this
private message bug since 0.9 (on 0.91 and 0.92).

Version 0.8 freezed on the Admin Panel, but private messages ere OK. On 0.80 you
couldn't put the cursor on the Subject box when posting a message to the board.

Please be free to use:
http://www.acutron.net/forum/

I enabled private messages, so you may register there and send me (ajoliveira) a
private message. I tried and when I put the cursor on the message field,
bang...it immediately freezes.
I also see this bug.  I frequent www.rubiconownersforum.com and routinely lock
up when replying to private messages.  I'd be happy to send any info needed.
I don't think this is a problem anymore, I frequent 4 different phpBB message
boards (and one phpNuke one whose 'forum' part is simply phpBB embedded in the
portal) and have never had these problems. Unless someone still has these kind
of problems with phpBB boards, I think this bug can and should be resolved.
This bug is now fixed.
