> @johnath: I am waiting on reviews.

Typically, then, you should set the review:? flag and name specific reviewers for each patch. If you need help finding reviewers, I suspect dherman can help out.
uggh.. I messed up :(

I confused this bug with 707275 (SSL telemetry) where I am waiting for review.

For this bug, I want to get initial feedback from Sid Stamm. I am meeting with Sid today, and we will be discussing this. I will then request a review. Sorry for the confusing comment earlier.

Thanks for your interest. If you have thoughts on the feature and what things we should measure, I would love to hear them.

1000?  Are there really 1000 things we're gonna measure?
Nope. I will change the final value once I am done with all of them.

Your patches need more lines of context.  I'm only getting three which is not enough for reviewing.  Need 8.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Creating_a_patch_that_can_be_checked_in

The approach looks reasonable.  Fix my nits, then we'll flag it for review (probably mossop on this patch).

Nit: this line is way too long, please wrap it.
Sorry about the context, I was pretty sure I had fixed my .hgrc. 

There are two popups in the addon install flow. The first is "Firefox prevented this site from asking you to install", once you allow the site to ask you, the site actually tries to install and Firefox prevents that and shows up a dialog saying "Are you sure you want to install?" This is why I chose "ADDON_ASKING_PREVENTED" as the name here: PREVENTED_ADDON_INSTALL doesn't seem right.


browser.js already has some pretty  long JS lines; so I figured that line wrapping was only recommended for C/C++. What's the recommended way to wrap JS lines? I tried breaking on property accesses (the dots), but it looked pretty ugly to me.

@dao: thanks. I will fix those along with other nits I will have to fix after feedback.
I just talked to Taras, and he told me that changing the number of buckets in a Histogram would require changing the name of the histogram. In that case, it seems sensible to me to have a large bucket count for enumerated values such as these.

Ah, this += is a bitwise OR, then?  Please actually use a bitwise OR to avoid mistakes where the same flag is included twice.

For shorter lines, assign Components.interfaces.nsISecurityUITelemetry to some local var (say nsISecTel) and use that instead of x.y.z.foo.

Thanks Honza. I have fixed the patch; it seems I can't actually carry over the review+ though. Can you please set the flag for the new attachment?

Also, re moving the idl file: I am not certain whether that is also the correct place for it (maybe it is better to keep it in components/toolkit/telemetry). Since updating the location means updating all the patches, I am going to keep it in the current place for now and move it once I have further input on the correct place.

It is also important to limit the number of buckets. I suggest cutting the number from 1000 to 100 or less.
Comment on attachment 640405
UI Telemetry for SSL Warnings

Review of attachment 640405:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

How does the enumerated histogram work? Does it value gets its own bucket, which don't necessarily have any statistical correlation? That sounds ok, just trying to understand if that's what it means.

The OR'ing of values you're doing in exceptionDialog.js seems weird to me. You should just add a data point entry for each of the cases, otherwise the data for a single case will be under-represented for when it's merged (OR'ed) with another value. (sure in theory the data will still be there but it will make analysis harder)
Also you're already at the powers of 2 limit because adding another one will make it fall into the next group (e.g. 30 + 4 + 8 will be mixed with 40 + 2).
If there's any value in the merged data you can always report it in an extra bucket.


And the variable name 'telemetryId' isn't really great because all this data is going to the same histogram (with id="SECURITY_UI"), so if you still need to use it there or elsewhere I'd suggest "telemetryBucket" or "bucketId" for example.
@bsmith: sure. Do you also have input on where to put the idl ?

You can reduce the telemetry footprint being added in this file by doing:

let bucketName = isMalware ? "WARNING_MALWARE_PAGE_" : "WARNING_PHISHING_PAGE_";

and then on each about:* case you just need to add one line:

Thanks, bsmith! I have moved the location of the IDL, and modified the histogram. We are already nearing 50; I propose keeping it at 100. 

Moving the location changed all the patches: I don't have the privileges to carry over the review flags. Can someone with the requisite privileges carry the review +s ?
Thanks felipe. I have modified all the patches. As discussed on IRC, I am keeping EqualsIgnoreCase since aboutRedirector.cpp lower cases everything before redirecting. Thus, about:CertError could also work; so I am being conservative.
