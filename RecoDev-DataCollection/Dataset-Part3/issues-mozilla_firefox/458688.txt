changes setTimeout to executeSoon

This patch switches "setTimeout" to "executeSoon". The tests pass on my local machine. I do wonder if the pages will load fast enough on tinderboxen.

This patch also enables two simple tests in browser_Extensions.js, so we get even basic coverage on that code.
I'm not sure I understand the motivation here. executeSoon's advantage over timeouts is really only just that it's more explicit about why the delay is needed (one spin through the event queue). If 1 second timeouts are causing problems, switching to executeSoon is unlikely to help and would probably even hurt.
what you probably want here is to wait for a load event, then use executeSoon

v2 - uses "load" events for intial pages

This patch is the same as the previous except I dropped the "executeSoon" used to wait for the pages to load. Instead, I use sequential page "load" events, then use "executeSoon" for other hand-off situations, but not page loads.

[this was based on feedback from gavin and shawn on IRC]

browser_Browser.js is currently failing intermittently on tinderbox when I don't recall seeing that happen before. Should this be backed out?

See comment 0 and comment 1 !?
Ok the problem here is that you are racing two page loads. When one page completes it triggers the test to finish. You rely on the other page loading first. Is loading both at the same time necessary?

I don't see how that answers my question. Presumably if I haven't seen it before it is failing more than previously.

This changes the loads to be one after the other. Use a web progress listener to verify the load of page B is completed before checking how many times the load event fired.

It is not supposed to answer your question about a backout.

More often, maybe, I don't know.

Test code only so I think I can r+ this. After Dave explained the issues with me on IRC, I understand why the webprogresslistener is a better choice for monitoring page loads when frames are involved.

Suggests the progress listener is never seeing a state change with STATE_IS_WINDOW + STATE_IS_NETWORK + STATE_STOP. Seems strange

Perhaps someone who knows network code can help here.
Or rather it might be seeing it before the corresponding onload, no?  I'm not entirely convinced the ordering of those two is guaranteed, but that's only my best guess as to what's going on here.
Er, nevermind.  It's timing out, not failing the onload test.  Pretty odd.
No, as soon as the progress listener sees STATE_IS_WINDOW + STATE_IS_NETWORK + STATE_STOP it calls onPageBLoadComplete which does a test which would show up in the log. If the load events fire after the progress listener sees that then we'd just see a test failure.
I can't see what might be going on here and won't have time to work on it further for now.
This test sporadically timed out today, FWIW:

The difference is in the 196612 (0x30004), 65552 (0x10010), 65552 (0x10010), 131088 (0x20010) pattern.  This is where the timeout occurs. For passing tests on windows we get three 0x10010 states, and on mac and linux we get two.  On a failing test, it always times out after the first 0x10010 after the 0x30004.

bitwise AND'ing these states to all possible values of the state flag produces the following results:
= 196612 (0x30004) = 
STATE_TRANSFERRING  
STATE_IS_REQUEST  
STATE_IS_DOCUMENT  

= 65552 (0x10010) =
STATE_STOP
STATE_IS_REQUEST 

= 131088 (0x20010) =
STATE_STOP
STATE_IS_DOCUMENT

This honestly doesn't tell me a whole lot, but I'm posting it to see if it spurs any thoughts.  I'm wondering if we're in some kind of race condition with the onPageBLoadWithFrames listener.  I'm going to kick off some runs with that commented out and see what happens.
Still fails with the event listener commented out, but now it does two 0x10010's before timing out in the same place.  So I've affected it slightly, but not enough to make the test pass.  Will try to get the debug HTTP logging turned on and see what that says.
The test was disabled on m-c, but not on 1.9.1, and it's failing on that branch.

I think the issue with this test is that there can be multiple browser windows open, and then Application.activeWindow isn't necessarily the one that the test lives in. There's no straightforward way to get the fuelWindow for the current window, which is a FUEL design flaw.
This was also an issue with browser_discovery.js on 1.9.1, btw. I fixed that by using the tabbrowser and DOM APIs instead of FUEL, a solution we obviously wouldn't want here: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d53e256b5cb6

If the problem is that there can be multiple browser windows open then doesn't this change make the test fail in that case? Where are the multiple browser windows coming from? Is a previous test not cleaning up properly?

My assumption is that if the window re-gained focused, the other window is closed.

They must come from previous tests, but usually they try their best to clean up. I think the problem is that window.close isn't completely synchronous, at least on Linux.
Another case where the issue turned out to be another window is bug 498704.

It's true that window.close isn't synchronous, but there are ways to listen for when a window finally closes. We should probably try to file bugs on tests that don't do this and fix them, or maybe we can do something in the test harness to wait for additional windows to close before running the next tests.

If this is easily reproducible in a VM, could someone try it in a record-and-replay VM?
One problem is that virtual machine record-and-replay simply does not work with multiple virtual CPUs due to fundamental hardware limitations. Namely, with truly parallel execution on multiple cores, different cores can have races in shared memory, and it's impossible for the virtual machine monitor to detect and reproduce those interactions.

The only way to record and replay genuinely parallel races in shared memory with existing hardware is to instrument instructions that access shared memory, and that's certain to be high overhead. Low-overhead solutions require hardware support (e.g. Bodik et al.'s "Flight Data Recorder") which doesn't exist.
Ah, bummer. :-(

Let's disable this test, IMO.  It was disabled for a while, until Dao thought he had a fix for it, and we should just go back to that state if we can't figure it out.

dtownsend: is there a bug on auditing the tests with multiple windows to make sure that they wait for the close to finish?  I think that sounds like a promising direction, might help other tests as well.
Note the details and the patterns, though. It started up again on May 2nd, only because the 10.6 debug mochitest-other was unhidden on May 1st, and for whatever reason, it has failed all along more on 10.6 debug than anywhere else. Then suddenly on May 11th, we picked up a few non-Mac fails, then in a separate sudden, after the releng downtime this morning, and then the failure to realize for a while that we weren't getting sendchange on 10.5 after the downtime, every single 10.5 debug mochitest-other has failed. _That_, unlike all the other randomness, makes me think the test has caught something, either in one of the things we pushed while we didn't realize we weren't running Mac tests, or in a change from the downtime.

nthomas was kind enough to trigger builds for the missed changesets, and a few extra tests for the changeset from before the downtime, which I hope will be enough to tell us whether we landed a regression today, or we still haven't noticed all the brokenness from the downtime (or, I guess, whether we just hit a really bad run of luck with those seven runs in a row).
And while the builds for the missing chunk of pushes are still going, the extra tests against 6a71deda9822 (the last changeset from before the downtime, which was the last one to have a 10.5 Mdoth not hit this) both did hit this, pointing an inexplicable finger at something from the downtime as being the reason this test is now apparently permaorange on 10.5 debug.
I was looking at the logs, actually when we browser.addProgressListener, we would expect browser to be waiting for us, really looking at the log it is loading a bunch of pages, or at least many are open:
about:blank, http://example.com/#randomnumber#, about:config, http://example.com/, about:mozilla

All of these pages seem to come from sessionstore/test/browser/browser_522545.js that runs not much before this test... I think disabling this test won't bring anything useful, we should look at tests that run before this one, or, as a workardound, this test should ensure status of the browser on startup and wait for eventual pages that are still loading.
hm, or those tabs/windows are just being destroyed... btw the fact "onStateChange:" is called as soon as we add the progressListener is bad, since something loading is removing the listener before we use it.
sigh, nvm previous comments. The only problem is that onStateChange does never receive complete.

this is what we get in the last log:
STATE_IS_NETWORK + STATE_IS_WINDOW + STATE_IS_DOCUMENT + STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_START
STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_START
STATE_IS_DOCUMENT + STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_TRANSFERRING 
STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_STOP
STATE_IS_WINDOW + STATE_IS_DOCUMENT + STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_START
STATE_IS_WINDOW + STATE_IS_DOCUMENT + STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_START
STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_START
STATE_IS_DOCUMENT + STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_TRANSFERRING
STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_STOP
STATE_IS_REQUEST + STATE_STOP

what we expect
STATE_IS_WINDOW + STATE_IS_NETWORK + STATE_STOP

I landed this: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8e48c8fb8299

NeilAway: dao1: yeah, it would make a difference, given that weak references are broken on trunk

NeilAway: see bug 533290 comment 11 in particular
What you did is compatible with what i was observing, the progresslistener was stopping at random positions, and the windows from previous tests were being collected, thus I guess GC was running and collecting the listener... good catch.

Is it possible that the installation of the resistors onto the Rev3 Leopard machines (bug 563836) affected this? I went over all of the downtime bugs and I can't see anything else that could've.
I think/hope we're done here. Obviously the underlying problem still needs fixing in bug 533290.
