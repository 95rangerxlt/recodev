It works if you go to View -> Larger Font, but the keyboard shortcut doesn't work.

Oddly enough, 'cmd/ctrl -' does work for shrinking the font.

I am testing on Firefox 35 and Nightly [Linux] and it works using 'CTRL +' and 'CTRL -'. Not sure about Mac OS, but seems to be fixed. So, could be this a non valid (=fixed) issue any more?

Just double checked, and 'cmd +' still isn't working on OSX.  But this definitely helps narrow it down.

Added 2nd commandkey "=" for OS X compatibility.

Hello,

I found that 'cmd =' failed in OS X but 'cmd +', that is pressing shift and '=' key worked. So added another commandkey `commandkey2` as `=` and it works now.

Nice. It would be perfect if you could add the same comment about "=" that is found in browser.dtd.
