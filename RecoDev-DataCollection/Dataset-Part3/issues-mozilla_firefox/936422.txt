See the light theme mockup in which the highlighter is in locked state. It has the separators. The dark theme is in unlocked state, so we do not exactly know the color .. Thus choosing the best possible color from the palette is the solution :

But don't start on this until we're sure of what we're doing. See bug 935956 for details.
This needs to be done before anything else as the separators are missing on Aurora too.
This is not dramatic. I even prefer with no separator :)

Maybe Albert can help.

Patch 1.patch

I attached a patch that restores the border removed in bug 927815. I also changed the colors and margins (I think in the mockup there is more space between the tag name and the separator than between the buttons and the separator).

I took the color from the sidebar tabs separator (bug 929127 comment 23) but if you think it must be changed, I can do it.

Can you explain why you needed to change the value of -moz-margin-start?

Well, it's not exactly related to this bug, but in the mockup (http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups/devTools/ux-refresh-2013/LightTheme-Inspector-Locked@2x.png) it seems to be more space between the tag name and the separators than between the separators and the buttons. However, I can set it back to 6px.

I don't think you need to use `border: 0 solid #5a6169;`.

You could just set `-moz-border-end: 1px solid #5a6169`.

And you're right about the margins.

Patch 2

'border: 0 solid #5a6169;' is how it was before bug 927815, however I made the changes you proposed as they make sense.

I don't upload a new screenshot because it looks they same.

Patch 3

I don't know where my head is, the last patch is not correct, it would be a regression of Bug 931834.

This one is the correct one.
