In browser/devtools/styleinspector/test/browser/browser_bug683672.js we add an event listener:
browser.addEventListener("load", tabLoaded, true);

It is never removed and could potentially cause a memory leak (not sure how the test passes). This was copied from other tests so we should go through at least all of out DevTools tests and ensure that the listener is removed.
