Track whether the project editor is used in WebIDE.

Track whether the project editor is used in WebIDE.
Currently I am measuring:

* Displaying the project editing (existing project, new, etc.)
* Saving a file
* Creating a new project
* Importing an existing project

Happy to hear any feedback on additional metrics to measure.

Axel, we've talked about this in the past a bit.  Any additional editing metrics we should gather?

Alex, you may also have additional ideas.

We could add many more probes, but I think that's enough for the project editor.
`webideProjectEditor` was really the most missing one!

I think we are going to call toolClosed multiple times if we switch between multiple non-project-editor decks.
Not a big deal if toolClosed handle this nicely.

Ah, I suppose you're right.  I'll remove my comment about only calling the function on a change.

Anyway, `toolClosed` does handle multiple calls in a row fine: it just stops a timer, if one was already running.
Fixed test:

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Additional Telemetry in WebIDE to drive upcoming product decisions.  Most WebIDE users are on Dev. Ed., so this accelerates metrics collection.
[User impact if declined]: No real user impact, would just have to wait a cycle for useful metrics.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: On m-c, updated test coverage.
[Risks and why]: Low, WebIDE only.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
Jryan, just got back into town, realize this ticket is in "resolved mode" but here is some additional input. A useful metric would be how long user is on one project once he's opened it and also a time on the editing usage. We need to try to identify repeat usage in some way.

Should be low risk on the aurora release and should not impact the product. taking it.
