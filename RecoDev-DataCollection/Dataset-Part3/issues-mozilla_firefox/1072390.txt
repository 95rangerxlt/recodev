With Nightly, get the below crash.  With Beta, works fine.  I have also reported this to the site owner, but given the difference between Nightly and Beta, it seems like this is also a Firefox bug.

The crash is trac crashing, if I understand correctly?
And if so, can you reproduce if you turn off spdy on Nightly?
This works in current Nightly.
