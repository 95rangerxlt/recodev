This bug is about injecting the notification UI properly on all windows, track the amount of times it has been displayed, track if the user clicked on X/Learn More to stop displaying it, and so on.
Note: the same popup element is used for the searchbar and web content. In order to make it not show for content, we will need to use this snippet somewhere:

> let popup = document.getElementById("PopupAutoComplete");
> let searchbar = document.getElementById("searchbar");
> popup.addEventListener("popupshowing", function(event) {
>   if (popup.mInput == searchbar.textbox) {
>     // this is a search from the searchbar, unhide the footer
>   }
> }, false);
Hi Blake, can you provide a point estimate and if this bug should be marked as [qa+] or [qa-]
I'm going with a 5, because I'm not sure how we're going to log the info we're tracking, and I'm also not sure what the full set of info we'll be collecting is.

Philipp, are you sure you want to limit this for the first session after the switch, and not just limit it for five searches, independent of how many sessions that takes to reach?

Good point! Thinking about this again, I'd change it even further:
- Show it a minimum of 5 times (regardless of sessions)
- Show it a minimum of 1 session (even if the user has seen it more than 5 times)
- Clicking the close button or changing the search provider hides it immediately

That way we prevent the case where someone would like to act on it *next time*, but seconds later the notification is gone.
The work for this is done, but the code review is happening in bug 1029818.
So I'm going to close this, and do any further work over there.

Hi Blake, is the [qa+] still relevant then?
Hmm.  Good question.  Let's say "no", and do the testing over there, too.
(Actually, that bug seems to mostly be about testing.)
