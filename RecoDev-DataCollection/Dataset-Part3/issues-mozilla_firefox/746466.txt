STR: Open about:home.  Resize your window so it's short, and a vertical scroll bar appears in the about:home tab.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page.

Notice that the dark gray bar ends one screen-height from the top of the page.  It should instead extend all the way down to the bottom of the page.

If you make the window short enough, it looks like two background layers overlap, and more fun things happen.
Re-adding background-attachment: fixed; fixes this specific issue, but it's not actually what we want. (Also, that would regress bug 740235.)

Actually, the -moz-linear-gradient in the background-image isn't extending beyond the first screen height.

Moving the background-color and background-image values from html to body doesn't help, even with background size: 100% 100% for the gradient, because background sizes on body and html don't seem to follow the actual computed heights of the body and html elements, as a strange special case.

My solution was to bring back the #container div and set the backgrounds on that. It's not pretty, but it works without regressing bug 740235. If you have a better solution, it is welcome. :)

Did you move both?
Moving only background-image works, but it seems that also moving background-color causes the background-color only to be painted for the first viewport height.

Setting backgrounds on body is bizarrely handled. See the following testcase:

data:text/html,<style>body { background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(cyan,cyan); border: 10px solid #000; }</style><body><script>document.body.innerHTML=getComputedStyle(document.body).height</script></body>

The computed height of <body/> is 0px and the border is drawn as expected, but the cyan background gets painted over the whole viewport.

I think I moved background-image only.

This is very minor UI polish - no need to track for release.
