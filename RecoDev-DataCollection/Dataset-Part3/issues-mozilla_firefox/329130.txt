I have the start page set to about: so I can easily tell I've gotten the version I'm expecting (I update to latest nightly build 2-3 times a week).  Today's (2006/03/02) bombs out with this error msg:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: jar:file:///usr/local/firefox/chrome/toolkit.jar!/content/global/about.xhtml
Line Number 82, Column 1:
<a id="mozlink" href="&releaseBaseURL;1.6a1.html">&brandShortName; 1.6a1</a>
^

and things go downhill rapidly from there (history and bookmarks fail to be found, so the 'Go' and 'Bookmarks' menus are essentially empty.

The 2006/02/24 build I'm running now works fine.  The actual history and bookmarks are still there and intact, so presumably it's all an error cascade from the same root cause of XML parsing issues.

Reproducible: Always

I see also the error on WinXP, latest trunk.
It appeared for the first time between 1.9a1_2006022414 and 1.9a1_2006022423.

Re-branding is a separate issue which I didn't want deal with.
You don't need another review since this is basically the same patch.
And please request approval-branch-1.8.1 from someone particular.
Could someone check this one into 1.8 branch, please (Gavin?)
