I don't think you need to change the key. Come to think of it, it may cause additional work for localizers who will no longer like us that much. Can you post in dev-l10n or ask in #l10n what's the right thing to do for that? r=me if they are fine with it.
Ok.
Pike: I wonder if something like "show only enumerable properties" would be easier to digest in general, and it doesn't negate the name that might stay in English. and you could add a comment that "enumerable is a state of a property defined in JS. When in doubt, leave untranslated"

victorporof: that's acceptable, but it negates the default value it has now (which is true). so, if "Show non-enumerable properties" is true, then "Show only enumerable properties" would need to default to false

Panos, do you think it's an acceptable compromise to change the default pref? I somehow incline to believe it's fine (what does "hidden" mean, really?), but it's your decision.
I'm OK with that change. Are they OK with changing the key label while leaving the content the same?

Made the changes to the pref and, as per Pike's suggestion, added some extra explanations in the dtd file about what "enumerable" is.

Yes, as long as I change the label. Explaining what "enumerable" is brings some extra bonus points :)
