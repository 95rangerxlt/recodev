s/rc2/rc1/ -- unless, you want the win32 builds to go somewhere else than mac and linux ;)

^^^ Why does this say 1.5.0.7? Is it unused?

Was going to have cf review and rhelmer sr, but the flags got screwed up. This is better.

For releases, yes.

Update verification config changes for 150eleven

You'll want to remove the "from" and "to" for the previous (1.5.0.9) release, or else it'll take much longer.

I think:
+release="1.5.0.10" product="Firefox" platform="Linux_x86-gcc3" 

is missing de ?

The 1.5.0.10 buildids on linux, mac, win look ok.

I confirmed what bc saw.  "de" is missing for Linux in that patch.  Mac and Windows are ok (no gu-IN or pa-IN for Mac as expected).

We should be using the shipped-locales file to verify the locales we are putting into these configs.

Preed also mentioned that the update checker scripts that run do not pull the locales based on the shipped-locales file, but are grabbed from some other source.   We should be using that file for any l10n related build automation to ensure we are shipping pieces for all locales.
