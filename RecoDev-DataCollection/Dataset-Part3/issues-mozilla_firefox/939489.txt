Seems documentElement._lightweightTheme can be null, if an add-on sets lightweightthemes=false on the <window>. Easy fix to avoid breakage is to just add a null-check when we try to use this in CustomizeMode.jsm.

Nice and defensive. Thanks Blair!
I wonder if we should make the catch blocks in customization enter/exit display some kind of message if something borked when entering/exiting. Pretty bad UI breakage if any of it breaks, tbh.

Possibly... but that would also mean we're *far* less likely to found out about issues, which IMO is more important at this stage.

To be clear, I would put something like "Uh-oh, opening customization mode failed with the following error: ... please report this here: [custom bugzilla link]." but I see your point, I guess.
