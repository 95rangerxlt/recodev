Make menuitems checkbox type

This makes the menu items for enabling spell checking and the dictionary list checkbox type.

Ben reviewed the original frontend patch so I guess this is his territory.
Thanks for finding this.

You'll also have to fix the "enabled" menuitem in
toolkit/content/widgets/textbox.xml in input-box-contextmenu
This is the context menu used by chrome.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
