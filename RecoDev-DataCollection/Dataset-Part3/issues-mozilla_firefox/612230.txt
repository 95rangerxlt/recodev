In RTL mode the bookmarks toolbar works fine as long as it fits into the window width with no overflow. As soon as any bookmark overflows the width, all the bookmarks disappear into the overflow pop-up.

Regression range: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=29bc8f25685d&tochange=014349e11696 which looks like bug 528884

tentatively assigning to Mano, feel free to opt-out if you don't have time available.
Blocking. The impression of all toolbar bookmarks being gone is pretty serious primary UI breakage.

this indentation change is probably a typo

thank you!
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a1e24da8518f

and the nit fix (mano, don't put checkin-needed if there's more fix needed!):

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/622d3a8f8ab1

the first check-in i forgot to set mano as user, so probably going to back this all out again and re-land. ugh.
And now I've totally screwed my tree up trying to backout these. I'm going to leave it in as-is. Mano, if you want me to change it, ping me and I'll figure it out.
In case you back this out and reland it: the second getComputedStyle argument is optional.
Thanks.
