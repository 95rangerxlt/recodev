> pref("browser.uitour.readerViewTrigger", "^https:\/\/www\.mozilla\.org\/[^\/]+\/firefox\/reading\/start");

(added in bug 1134501) triggers 9 warnings on a startup in a debug build:

WARNING: preserving unexpected JS escape sequence: file modules/libpref/prefread.cpp, line 393

Backslashes are supposed to be escaped in pref files. I'm guessing "https:\\/\\/" and so on, but I didn't test.

(a similar case was recently fixed in bug 1146097)

Looks right to me. I think it would also work with / in place of \\/, since you call the RegExp constructor rather than eval'ing a literal delimited by slashes.
Thanks for the r+. I'll leave it as-is for now wrt the backslashes being necessary.
