Currently GCLI comes with a ``help`` command pre-installed, but not all environments will want this, and all environments will need to install their own commands, so there is little benefit in pre-installing this one.

Opinions?
I think it is valuable to have a place to list commands, whether or not that command is "help" or "gcli list" or "gcli help", I'm not sure which is best. I think there should be some way to see a complete list of what is available though.
I guess I'm suggesting that help should move to demo/commands/help. That way it's clear that embedders get a clean slate when they start.

I'm not sure what happens if someone starts GCLI with no commands, which would be more likely to happen with this change.
It sounds like you might need a "base" gcli command stub that pops up some kind of "no commands registered". Or maybe ship with a single command to create new commands. Probably outside the scope of this bug though.
Created a branch for this in my github to keep wip. Low priority though.
