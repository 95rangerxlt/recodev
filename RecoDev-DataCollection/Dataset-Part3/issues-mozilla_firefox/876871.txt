When I focus on the Google search field on OS X, the halo is cropped at the top and bottom, breaking the glowing metaphor.  See screenshot attachment.

Issue with downloads button

I don't know if there are bugs for these too, but the downloads button is having the same problem.
*is a bug for this.
Doesn't seem as severe for me (Retina, 10.8) with a current build, vs screenshot. Did this get better?

It did. We can ensure this just doesn't happen by changing our overflow settings for the overflowable toolbar. This will also mitigate bug 886939. Patch in a second.

Overflowable toolbar should only overflow in x direction,

Trivial patch.

don't have a scrollbar instead of nothing,

Except, of course, this sets overflow-y: auto still, which doesn't really do what we want it to do. In fact, because the back button is 31px high, with a negative margin, we trigger a vertical scrollbar on OS X. Sigh.

Backed out in bug 0e19ff24a086 because using overflow: hidden in one direction means that even if you explicitly set overflow: visible, Gecko will actually render it as overflow: auto/scroll. See bug 353599. I'm hoping this will make nightlies so that we don't get a slew of "my navbar has a scrollbar" bugs filed.

Seems like the only way to fix this permanently would be to increase the inner height of the toolbar with a min-height, or stop using overflow altogether. I'm not sure if the latter is possible. Unassigning as I'm not sure of what a permanent fix here would entail. :-(

How about this?

patch v2

or even this, if that other patch isn't enough (I don't have OS X available to test this)
Comment on attachment 809075
patch v2

This wfm. I believe that per spec, we need to change the horizontal padding on the navbar to be less than 4px (that is, the back button is currently too far out of the border), but we can take care of that in another bug.

BTW, note that this sadly didn't happen. So today's nightly, at least on OS X (but possibly elsewhere) will have a vertical scrollbar in the navbar. Sorry. (we can't retrigger nightlies because of bug 846104)
