No bug and thousands. Bug 551849 tracks the general App and Home tab project, bug 588230 tracks Home Tab snippets which is what we want (for the Sync Key at least).
Bug 544819 is probably the closest bug we have on file for the kind of Home tab we need for this. Adding it as a dependency.

Yup, because about:home currently doesn't run with chrome privileges. We would need to turn them on in AboutRedirector, just like we did for about:sync-progress, and get a security review for that.

Part 1 (v0) about:home tab, scrapped

since raising privs on the page breaks the local storage, we will not be pursuing this compromise for ffx10. work uploaded for posterity.
We're going to do the same hack that we do for the session restore button (thanks for the pointer, Margaret!) . Here's what should happen in this bug:

Part 1: Duplicate openSetup() and openAddDevice() from browser/components/preferences/sync.js to browser/base/content/browser-syncui.js so that we can use them in browser.js. Note that an older version of openSetup() already exists there. (The code duplication sucks, we should fix this at some point, but not now... see bug 583366.)

Part 2: Add two links to the bottom of the about:home page:

  "Set Up Sync"    "Pair a Device"

Little bit like in this mockup (only shows one link, but you get the idea): https://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/projects/sync/setup-i3/n-m-d%204%20-%20activate%20page.html

There are two cases to consider:

(a) Sync is not set up: Show both links. "Set Up Sync" launches openSetup(null), "Pair a Device" launches openSetup("pair").

(b) Sync is set up: Show only "Pair a Device" which launches openAddDevice().

Very nice work! There's a few nits here and there and the links don't do exactly what they need to do yet, but this is easily fixed. See below for details.

No need to qualify the tag name here. Just doing ".sync-link" is enough and actually preferred (cf https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS#Don.E2.80.99t_qualify_Class_Rules_with_tag_names)

Yeeeeaaaah we probably don't want to mess with this. I realize the mockup I mentioned in comment 6 doesn't show this link, so I'm not blaming you for removing it. But I bet the Engangement would love to have a word with us if we remove this. :)

Just keep the "aboutMozilla" <div> and add the buttons in the "syncLinksContainer" <div> below. If you look at https://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/projects/sync/allFlows-i2.png, that's how it's arranged. (Yes, the "About Mozilla" link says "Firefox answers to no-one but you. Learn more." but that's a change that's outside the scope of this bug. :))

This is not entirely correct. As I said in comment 6:

(a) When Sync is set up, this calls gSyncUI.openAddDevice()
(b) When Sync is not set up, this calls gSyncUI.openSetup("pair");

Awesomesauce. Over to :gavin for browser peer review.

Note: this is only the first step for this bug. Two more parts to come:

* Update about:home, if it's open, on weave:service:setup-complete and weave:service:start-over observer notifications
* Tests! See browser/base/content/test/browser_aboutHome.js for the existing tests. Can easily add test cases to that file.

Oh hah, onLoginFinish() is also called on "weave:service:setup-complete". Yeah, let's separate those cases out. Let's create an onSetupComplete() method that calls onLoginFinish() and does this work.

Simpler:

  let browsers = gBrowser.browers;
  for (let i = 0; i < browsers.length; i++) {
    let b = browsers[i];

Unless I'm mistaken, the following is equivalent:

  if (b.currentURI.spec == "about:home")

(Death to regular expressions!)

Any particular reason you're catching errors and then reporting them to the error console? I *think* the observer service does that automatically already.


Same comments apply to onStartOver(). In fact, you could even factor the whole "find about:home and show or hide this button" logic out into a helper showHideSetupSyncAboutHome() that takes a single bool argument for the .hidden attribute of the button.

I didn't make the helper function - to change visibility requires the browser object, and I guess I could have passed that and a bool to the helper, and then gotten the button from the browser dom, but that's a lot more code to replace just one line.

Turns out I was lying. We have that string *with the ellipsis*. But the link shouldn't have the ellipsis. Sorry about that. Can you bring it back?
Comment on attachment 568514
part 1, v3: reversed "pair" and "setup" positions per mockup

I just gave this a spin. Some feedback besides the string thing I just mentioned:

* It seems the default colour for links is not 'blue' but #0000ee.
* The links need more top margin so that the distance to "About Mozilla" is a bit higher. margin-top: 1em seems to look ok to me.
* When you click the buttons, the text shifts slightly to the right. That's because buttons have this 3D effect. You can see the default CSS in [1]. So we want to add something like this:

  .sync-link:active {
    padding: 0px 6px 0px 6px;
  }

Part 3, v1: tests for aboutHome sync links layout, sync links behavior after sync setup/unlink

Looks great. It occurred to me that we can and should also add tests to verify that clicking on the buttons open the right dialogs. You can use

  EventUtils.sendMouseEvent({type: "click"}, button, win);

to synthesize a click event (`win` is the window that `button` is in, in this case the contentWindow of the about:home page). To observe the dialog window being opened, do something like this:

  let expectedDialog = "Weave:AccountSetup";
  Services.ww.registerNotification(function onWindow(subject, topic) {
    let wintype = subject.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIDOMWindow)
                         .document.documentElement.getAttribute("windowtype");
    if (topic == "domwindowopened" && wintype == expectedDialog) {
      Services.ww.unregisterNotification(onWindow);
      executeSoon(runNextTest);
    }    
  });

Of course, this needs to be done before you send the synthesized click event, and you want to change `expectedDialog` depending on which dialog we're expecting :).

String re-use in different contexts is usually frowned upon, it's easy to run into issues with different locales wanting different strings despite en-US working fine with the same (due to e.g. length issues or contextual differences in language). It might be a good idea to run this through dev.l10n as a followup (I think it's already the case that these strings are re-used in different places).

This works fine for subsequent loads, but it won't hide the link on the page that you clicked it on, after setup is complete. Is there a "sync-setup-complete" notification (or something like that) that you can use to hide the link in already-loaded tabs? See Browser:HideSessionRestoreButton for similar situation (bug 644998).

Here's a better version, one that will hopefully work:

  let expectedDialog = "Weave:AccountSetup";
  Services.ww.registerNotification(function onWindow(subject, topic) {
    let win = subject.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIDOMWindow);
    win.addEventListener("load", function onLoad() {
      win.removeEventListener("load", onLoad, false);
      let wintype = win.document.documentElement.getAttribute("windowtype");
      if (topic == "domwindowopened" && wintype == expectedDialog) {
        Services.ww.unregisterNotification(onWindow);
        executeSoon(runNextTest);
      }    
    }, false);
  });

This looks great, but you could avoid a lot of code duplication by creating a helper function, `expectDialogWindow(expectedDialog)` that contains basically the following lines:

>+    Services.ww.registerNotification(function onWindow(subject, topic) {
>+      let win = subject.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIDOMWindow);

And then just call it in the tests with `expectDialogWindow("Weave:AccountSetup")` etc.

STR: Behavior for sync links ("Set Up Sync" and "Pair Device") on about:home

On load of about:home, if Sync has not been set up, both links should appear below the "About Mozilla" link.
After setting up sync successfully, the "Set Up Sync" link should no longer be visible on about:home, without refreshing the page.

On load of about:home, if Sync is already set up, only "Pair Device" should be visible.
Unlinking Sync (Pref->Sync->unlink) successfully should cause the "Set Up Sync" link to be visible on about:home, without refresh.
looks good on s-c nightly.  

Note last line of STR's in comment 39.  Statement doesn't exclude Pair Device, which should always be present.
