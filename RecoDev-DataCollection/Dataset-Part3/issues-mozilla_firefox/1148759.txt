Created attachment 8585031
demo.js

First two block in attachment works ok. The last (third) block prints just

> "before"

but node.js (0.12 with --harmony flag) outputs

> before
> { value: {}, done: false }
> after
> { value: undefined, done: true }

as expected. I.e. line 

> console.log(result);

ceases the execution.

maybe a regression from bug 1033153? it adds the code.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2548cc70c191
Simpler testcase:

  console.log({ x: Promise.resolve() });

So basically the problem is in prettyprinting an object with a property value that's a Promise.
Or even simpler, open the console and type:

   ({ x: Promise.resolve() })

Ensure that we can inspect objects that reference a Promise
