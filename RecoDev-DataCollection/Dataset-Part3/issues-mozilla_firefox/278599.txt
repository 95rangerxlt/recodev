patch - fixes annoying focus

This is regression since 2004-07-29.

"this.focus()" has no meaning because "things like cut/copy/etc" are called by
right click (aEvent.button == 2, see line 523).
dup of bug 189938 ?

> dup of bug 189938 ?

Bug 189938 is about Mozillla Suite and seems to be fixed - the focus correctly
switches to content area.
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050116

This is bug in Firefox code.

patch - fixes annoying focus

How odd. Vlad seems to have put that in himself, as part of his mostly bug
252875 checkin last July, but the comment isn't... er, was that where that was
supposed to go? Surely we don't get past the openBookmark() line doing anything
like cut/copy? Personally, I'd refocus the sidebar on a metaKey+click, but
that's just me.

To get anywhere with a patch, you need to ask a peer for review: since it's
Vlad's code and bug, he's the likely candidate.
So, here's the problem.

You click on a bookmark in the sidebar.
That bookmark is selected *and opened*, since we open on single-click so we can
be like IE.
Focus goes to the content area.

Now, at this point, you have a bookmark visually selected.

What if you want to hit C-x/C-c to cut/copy it?  It's (almost) impossible to use
keyboard shortcuts to cut/copy/etc. in the sidebar without this patch, as the
focus will never be where you want it to be.

So that's the issue -- you can either have working copy/cut/etc shortcuts, or
you can have the content area get focused.

If we weren't trying so hard to be like IE here, we'd just open on double-click
like any sane tree, and this problem goes away.  Gonna bounce the review to
mconnor, so he can pick his poison ;)
Is this bug related to bug 299514 (Random unresponsive keyboard shortcuts and
context menus due bad focus in tabs)?
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
