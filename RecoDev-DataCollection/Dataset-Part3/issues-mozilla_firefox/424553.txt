When right clicking on a title of an item in Google Reader the context-sensitive menu has a LOT of extra items and selecting "Open link in New Tab" does not work. However, it appears that that if you click on the title to have it open a new tab and then go back to Google Reader that the proper functionality is then restored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://reader.google.com
2. Right click on the title of an item
3. Select "Open link in New Tab"
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, but you would expect that the tab should have been opened.

Expected Results:  
The menu should have not contained the extra items, and the tab should have opened.

As stated previously, it appears that if you click on one of the titles and then go back to Google Reader that the proper functionality is restored.

This appears to have been fixed in Beta 5.
