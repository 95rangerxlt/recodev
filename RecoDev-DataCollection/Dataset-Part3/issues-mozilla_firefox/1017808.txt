Making browser.xml's get_messageManager more robust
I could give a r+ for the change itself (hard to argue against "making xx more robust"), but I wonder why this failure is happening in the first place (a browser without a frameLoader?).

Checking to see if Drew has any ideas..
*** Bug 1017813 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Thanks for flagging me.  This is the error I was expecting to see in bug 1013722.  When I was debugging it and actually looking at browser.QI(Ci.nsIFrameLoaderOwner) and browser.QI(Ci.nsIFrameLoaderOwner).frameLoader, what I saw was that browser.QI(Ci.nsIFrameLoaderOwner).frameLoader was null, so the messageManager getter should have been throwing an error like this one when it does frameLoader.messageManager, but instead the getter was returning undefined.  I fixed my bug and didn't ask questions.

What I seemed to be seeing in bug 1013722 was that frameLoader was null after the browser had been closed.  Given that, I think this patch here is good.  Maybe the alternative is to find out why it's null in that case and if anything can be done about it.
So, can I land it?
See my comment in bug 1019670 comment 2. Ping me on IRC and I can help with that.

I'm more convinced that this patch will be the right thing to do in the end, so r+. Though I think it would be good to understand what set of tests causes the problem to show up. It could be simply that this patch is missing, or that a test or the service itself is adding a message listener and forgeting to remove it. Can you file a follow up for that?
Will do.
