Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]: UI change in WebIDe
[Suggested wording]: WebIDE now has a sidebar-based UI
[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]:
Happy to add this note for 43. Is there anything documenting it or showing it that I could link to?
Will, let's discuss what we could do to document this change.
I've updated (I think) all the pages under https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE to deal with this change. Please let me know if it looks all right!
