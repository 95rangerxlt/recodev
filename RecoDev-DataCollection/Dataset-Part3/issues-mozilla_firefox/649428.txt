Is this the version bump? 4.2a1pre isn't the right file any more, right?
If they're broken on all platforms with the same error, I strongly suspect one of Rob Strong's patches, bug 313956 is Windows-only, and "createprecomplete.py" is a file that Rob added.
createprecomplete seems to show up in both linux and windows, looking at the tails of the two logs.

http://l10n.mozilla.org/~axel/nightlies/?date=2011-04-12 has links to tons of logs.

I suspect that the new python script is running into the same problem as the jar optimize python script. If someone could check if this fixes it while I'm driving into the office I'd appreciate it.

khuey r+'d this over irc and I verified this fixes win32 l10n repacks locally. I'm going to wait on the Mac nightly fix before landing these.
