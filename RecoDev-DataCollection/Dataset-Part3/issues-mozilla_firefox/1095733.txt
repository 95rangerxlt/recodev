Steps to reproduce:

on about:startpage paste
navigator.mozGetUserMedia({audio:true, video:true}, function (stream) { console.log('yay'); }, function (err) { console.log(err); })
into the javascript console.


Actual results:

Nothing. 
With
NSPR_LOG_MODULES=mediamanager:5
I get the following output:
System JS : ERROR resource://app/modules/webrtcUI.jsm:181 - NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIURI.host]

Possibly caused by uri being undefined in http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/webrtcUI.jsm#156 ?


Expected results:

the getUserMedia popup should have appeared or the error callback called.

make gUM work from js console on about:home

Reuse Martin's origin code (NB: I changed your asciiHost to host. Hope that's ok).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure about this.  If we want to do the permissions right here, we should be storing permissions against an origin (not a host).  That differs from other uses, so maybe that's not appropriate for this fix.  WDYT?

If you are using "origin" as the name here, it's going to be surprising if this is bound to uri.host and not uri.prePath.

make gUM work from js console on about:home (2)

I shouldn't have named it getOrigin. To rule out confusion, here's the patch again with a less confusing name.

I hope this makes it clearer how feature-neutral I believe this patch to be. The only significant differences I believe it makes are:

1. Rather than throw, use made-up hostname for about: in gUM, like you do in IdP.
2. Use .host rather than .asciiHost in your existing IdP code.

#2 comes from purely from my attempt to consolidate code.

Please run this by me again on the new patch, as I don't understand whether it's a comment on existing behaviors or my patch. And please understand that I barely know the difference between an origin and a host. ;-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, this is easier.

I think that I'll open a new bug on tracking permissions against an origin.  That's a bigger change.
Is there a Try link handy for this? :)
I don't have one unfortunately with try being down.

Hi Jib, does this fix the failures from the try run too ?
