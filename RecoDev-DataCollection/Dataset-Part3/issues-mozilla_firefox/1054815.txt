This is very similar-looking to bug 1054411: for some reason once the new HTTP cache is enabled, this test is now connecting to google.com, which gets caught by our test infrastructure and the test is failed.

In that bug the solution was to Cancel() the channel earlier, IIUC.  Can we take a look here and see if it's the same issue?

This is blocking turning on mochitests for the new HTTP cache, which is about to land on release, so fairly urgent.

See the try results here for examples of the failure (note the patch that turns on the new cache):

Raymond:  you wrote this test--any chance you could look at this?
