Change descriptions of optional components - v1

Change the descriptions of "Developer Tools" and "Quality Feedback Agent", as per beltzner and myself's wordsmithery. Notice, I changed "Inspects" to "Inspect" to have proper subject/verb agreement with "Developer Tools".

Robert, I know you took issue with the changes to QFA_DESC, but both reed and I thought that "crash information" was a little more cryptic than "information about program crashes".
I have no problem with the new revised text... I took issue with
"Sends information about crashes to Mozilla."

which reads poorly to me.

I am waiting on word from bsmedberg as to whether the build foo he wrote picks up name changes in the installer's properties files and if so then these names will need to be changed so the l10n boxes will pick up on the change.
i of course have issues w/ both changes. Mozilla because it's the wrong kind of creature, and domi as mentioned in the other bug.

Let's change the keyname to be kind to l10n.

beltzner, though it is planned that there may be more than one developer tool in the installer for Firefox 3 there is currently only one tool while the checkbox label string is "Developer Tools". Just pointing out what I believe is a long standing discrepancy...

Change name and descriptions - v2

Rename "Developer Tools" to "DOM Inspector", use the new description, and rev the entity names. Already has ui-review+ from beltzner@IRC.
