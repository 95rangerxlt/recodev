The id should be changed to appmenu-edit-label or something like that.

The corresponding -moz-appearance: none; and background: transparent; in browser.css should be removed:

Does disabled="true" pick up the gray text color for labels?
Since this is a label and not a proper menu item, please make it use its own label text rather than reusing editMenu.label. We need that to localize it properly.

Yeah, comment 3 makes another good point. This is a slightly different context, so some locales might want to alter the string.

Please remove this class as well.

Does this keep the label aligned with the other menuitem labels? If not, it might be better to just change the id and the entity to make it clear that this isn't a menu item, conceptionally, but let it be a <menuitem> under the hood.

It actually doesn't show at all once I change it from menuitem to label even if disabled="true" is removed or changed to false.  Uploading patch so you can see if I did something wrong or if we should just leave it as a menuitem
Yes, let's do this: change the id and the entity to make it clear that this
isn't a menu item, conceptionally, but let it be a <menuitem> under the hood.
