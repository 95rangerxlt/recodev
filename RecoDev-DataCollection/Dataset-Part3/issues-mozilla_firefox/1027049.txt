We have two unused plugin infobar preferences: plugins.hide_infobar_for_blocked_plugin & plugins.hide_infobar_for_outdated_plugin.

We should remove them.

yeah, I am interested to do that..
how can I proceed....???
Since I was new to this ...Can you help me how to proceed...?
There is a general developer guide here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide
If you don't have yet, you should check out the source & build Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions

Comment 0 here describes the lines that need to be removed. Once you have done that, it would be good to confirm that the basic browser tests still run through fine using:
> mach mochitest-browser browser/base/content/test/

Then you should create a patch with your changes that you can submit here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/How_to_Submit_a_Patch

Feel free to contact me via IRC or e-mail if you get stuck.
