Both the browser-tabstrip and various non-native widget (buttons/menulists in particular, checkboxes too, very likely) has no feedback in proto/new pinstripe. This is extremely annoying in the advanced search UI in the places organizer for example, and regresses out aceessiblility story on mac just to where it was about three years ago...

Since both the buttons and the menulists are already not even close to the native ones, I think it'd be just fine to use images for this state too.

Example of described problem

Specifically these graphics?

I can't see what you are describing in the tabbar though.
The tabs have been fixed in bug 417904.
Kevin, we need your help here...
This was in Proto 0.16.1 but it didn't land with the Proto changes. Kevin?
I'm pretty sure that now we have focus feedback for controls that accept focus. What are we missing?
 * The "views" button within the sidebar
testing proto .17, it looks like the focus ring around the match case checkbox in the Find toolbar causes the checkbox and label to shift to the right a pixel or two.  other than that, things look pretty good.
