It does not. However, if you do `./mach build` and then re-run the STR it does.

I feel like it is not linking the new object file, since I do see "HeapSnapshot.o" in the log when running `./mach build devtools/shared/heapsnapshot`.

I believe this is specific to C++ linking, which you also seem to be guessing.

Does `./mach build devtools/shared/heapsnapshot toolkit/library` work?
And when I do `./mach build binaries` I see logs which I think are XUL being linked, that do not show up in doing `./mach build devtools/shared/heapsnapshot`:

> 0:03.52 libxul_s.a.desc
> 0:03.53 XUL
> 0:10.83 ld: warning: could not create compact unwind for _ffi_call_unix64: does not use RBP or RSP based frame
I believe the issue is that our dependency tree in dumbmake (which is used to auto-run toolkit/library) is not correct.

We can likely update this list to resolve it.  There was recent talk[1] of removing this feature, but there was no decision made.  It may be best to become comfortable with ./mach build binaries in any case.

This does work.

Why can't we just link if we re-built any object files? The other options seem like hacks...

I refer you to your nearest build peer for questions of this nature. :P I'm sure it would work once we've set the current system on fire sufficiently.

Does this cause `./mach build devtools/shared/heapsnapshot` to do what you mean?
