I had a question but forgot what it was and somehow sent the comment, Sorry!
What does a new-tab icon for Windows 8 look like? I looked at IE11 and didn't see anything unique to Windows 8 there. Thanks!

They are flat icons, without the slight gradient in it.
How did you make Toolbar.png specific to each Windows version ? I'd like to use the same technique for this bug. Thanks !

Tim, are you going to put up a patch here?

Yes, I've made one, though, I noticed it introduces a contrast regression, which is why I haven't posted anything yet. I simply need to update the colors of the new graphics to a darker one first :)

If I understand correctly, you've moved the original png files to -XPVista7.png -- why aren't these reflected as hg moves in the patch?

You can just use this file and have it be packaged as toolbarbutton-dropdown-arrow.png in the classic theme, can't you - the non-aero theme doesn't ever get used on Windows 8, I thought? That way we can avoid shipping the same files multiple times. See how this was done for the menuPanel.png images.

Same here and for tab-arrow-left.

Why no update in the classic theme for toolbarbutton-dropdown-arrow.png - that should also use the XPVista7 thing, right?

But the r- is because you override *.png with *-XPVista7.png on osversion<6.2, which includes XP, where (non-aero) you don't package a file called *-XPVista7.png. You should override on 6.1 and 6.0 only.
