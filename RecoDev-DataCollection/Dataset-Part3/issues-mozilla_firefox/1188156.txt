In bug 1161138 Pocket was switched over to the Mozilla L10N system.  This bug is for ensuring we turn on the remaining locales available to Pocket.  Many of these translations are already in the system, this change is targeting Firefox 42.

The current preference is: browser.pocket.enabledLocales = [en-US de es-ES ja ja-JP-mac ru]

Which we need to expand to include the following locales:

fr
pt-BR
zh-CN
en-GB
pl-PL
it
nl
zh-TW
es-MX
ko
cs
hu
pt-pl

Also, Pocket uses the code 'es-la' which I couldn't find in our locale list, hopefully the l10n crew can weigh in on which one that matches to.

This bug may not be necessary, bug 1168481 comment 11 indicated that instead of continuing to use the locale list we may want to open up to all locales even if Pocket does not support them.  I'll file a new bug for the pref flip and close then when done.

Also en-GB and en-ZA (one of which is in your list below) from bug 1168481 -- didn't land these on Firefox 41+ because we we assuming we'd just disable the .enableLocaleList instead of updating the whitelist.

> pl-PL

Firefox just has "pl", not "pl-PL".

> pt-pl

Hmm, Firefox has a pt-PT, but not a pt-PL. I'm assuming the former is meant here, for "Portuguese (Portugal)".

la as in "Latin America"?

We only have 4 es-* locales: es-ES (already shipped), es-ES (added here), es-AR, es-CL. Presumably the latter two [Spanish (Argentina) and Spanish (Chile)] are the possibilities to add here.

Patch v.1

Updated locale list from comment 0 with corrections from comment 2. Did not include es-AR/es-CL.

Kinda seems like we should really just flip browser.pocket.useLocaleList, but either way is simple.

Shouldn't this target 41? That's the release that bug 1161138 landed in (halfway through the Nightly cycle). We could double check to see if the relevant locales have actually done translations, but I'd expect them to do so, and so this should be fine to uplift to Aurora/41 in the next week or so (before it branches to beta).

According to http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/shipped-locales#60, there is no pl-PL locale. It is just listed as 'pl'.

r=me if you either confirm that pl-PL works or switch it to 'pl' and check that 'pl' works.

And this was pointed out in comment #2 actually (just read it now). Any reason why this stayed in the patch or did this just get forgotten when you wrote the patch?

Err, oops. I apparently just messed up when editing the list.

Bug 1188156 - Turn on locales available in our L10N and Pocket. r=jaws
Comment on attachment 8640674
Patch v.2

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Pocket
[User impact if declined]: Pocket not available in more locales.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
[Risks and why]: This basically is enabling Pocket in-product for the locales supported by the web service. Strings were added to the normal L10N flow in bug 1161138, so if this was any other Firefox feature we simply wouldn't have a whitelist at all.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: See comment 4. No string changes here, just  enabling locales.

Go go Mozilla! Push, push agenda and don't bother consulting users or local communities, no matter whatâ€¦
Comment on attachment 8640674
Patch v.2

Approved. I checked with l10n to be sure and they have no concerns with uplifting this.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/835bf8618bc4
I verified that Pocket is available in the locales added to 'browser.pocket.enabledLocales' across platforms (Windows 7 64-bit, Mac OS X 10.10.5 and Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit) using Firefox 41.0RC.
Verification on 41 RC should be enough here.
