After the latest checkin to Bug 246078, Firefox no longer checks if it is the
default browser on startup when "Firefox should check to see if it is the
default browser when starting" is checked.

Seems like something we would want to work for 1.0.
This should be blocking the pr.


Of course the workaround is to go to tools-options-general-"check now" under
firefox should check to see if it is the default browser.
Simple fix, PR_TRUE -> PR_FALSE.

No messing with other people's bugs. Unless you are the bug assignee, or have
some say over the use of their time, never change the Priority or Target
Milestone fields. If in doubt, do not change the fields of bugs you do not own -
add a comment instead, suggesting the change.

That is why i didn't change it ;)
what the heck was that comment about?
I think the poster was confused and thought that PR_TRUE -> PR_FALSE was
removing a priority flag from the the bug.  But it would still make no sense as
Blake was the assignee anyway.
Fixed.
