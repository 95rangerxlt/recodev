The Share button tooltip reads "Share This Page". Tooltips shouldn't use title capitalization, i.e. this one should read "Share this page" instead.

This needs to be fixed here (social-share-button.tooltiptext):

Fixed social share label and tooltip capitalization.

Marcus, thanks for the patch. social-share-button.label should actually use title capitalization, only social-share-button.tooltiptext should not.
