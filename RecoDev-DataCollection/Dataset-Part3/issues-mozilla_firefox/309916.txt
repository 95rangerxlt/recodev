If you have a mime-type handler that no longer exists, the View & Edit
Actions... dialog throws when it tries to get the display name, and doesn't show
any actions at all.

STR:
1. Click http://philringnalda.com/mtests/handlergone/hard.cheese
2. In the dialog, select Open with, Browse to a program you don't mind moving,
and check Do this automatically...
3. Change either the filename, or any part of the path, for the program you used
in step 2.
4. Open Tools/Options/Downloads, and click View & Edit Actions...
5. The dialog is blank, and the jsconsole says "Error: uncaught exception:
[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012
(NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsILocalFileWin.getVersionInfoField]"  nsresult:
"0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://browser/content/preferences/downloadactions.js :: anonymous :: line
251"  data: no]"

After customHandler.initWithPath(externalAppPath); we need to be sure
customHandler exists.
