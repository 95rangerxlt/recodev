Robert, any idea?
Let's add bbondy since he wrote the patch for Bug 760671
Is a different version of NSIS used? It sounds like AtMostWin2008R2 is not defined.
I bet it is using 2.33 which doesn't have 2008 defined. I bet it will need something similar to bug 668574 to add the capability to deal with 2008, etc.
Yup if it's using 2.33, I just verified and as Robert said, the latest it has is Vista.  I'll try to get a patch together today to fix this.
FYI, RelEng is going to be installing NSIS 2.46u because Thunderbird needs it, so it might be possible to switch mozilla-central over to that. Bug 762218 tracks getting it on all the slaves.
Is this happening really soon? if not I'll still write a patch for this.
Hmm, missed that it is unassigned so you should probably go ahead with a workaround in the meantime.

Patch v1

Tested by making a local nsi file and including override.nsh with the change inside this patch.
I tried this on win7, win2008r2, and win8 and the check works correctly on all.

Patch v1

Hey Jim, would you be able to pickup this review? I don't want to keep l10n builds broken for too long and rstrong is flooded with some critical reviews for app update and about 7 other patches I asked for review on for telemetry data.
try builds work with this patch also:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=aad2c0eb66ed
Verified this locally by replacing my makensis 2.46 with 2.33 and doing an l10n -fr build.  Could reproduce before the patch and can't after the patch.
