Suppose you want to set "text-align:right" on the root element of a document (or any element).

STR:
 1. Open web console (ctrl-shift-k)
 2. Type "document.documentElement.style.text", and see what the suggestions are.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
The Web Console's suggested autocompletion is "text-align", which is *invalid*. (see below)  It also pops up a list of selections, including "textAlign" (the correct thing), "textDecoration", and "text-align" and "text-decoration", and many other "text" CSS properties in their camelCase and hyphenated forms.

EXPECTED RESULTS: Just the camelCase form should be suggested. If you accept the suggested the hyphenated version, you get this error afterwards:
> document.documentElement.style.text-align = "right" [RETURN]
> x ReferenceError: invalid assignment left-hand side

Note that *this* works:
  document.documentElement.style["text-align"]
but this does not:
  document.documentElement.style.text-align
...I think because JS interprets the "-" as a minus sign there, and tries to subtract the two things.

I think we will have to special-case the hyphens in the property name in WCA_onAutocomplete:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/webconsole.js#838

We should just hide properties with hyphens in the name, because modifying the text already typed by the user could be annoying.
I'd like to work on this bug, could someone assign me please ? Thanks
Thanks! It's yours.

Apart from the change I mention below, we need to add a unit test to ensure we don't accidentally break this in the future. test_js_property_provider.js is particularly suitable for this, as it already contains similar validation checks. You can run it like this:

./mach xpcshell-test toolkit/devtools/webconsole/test/unit/test_js_property_provider.js

"contains" is now called includes, but it would be better to just use indexOf as above:

I ran the test_js_property_provider, I think it went fine. How am I supposed to add a new unit test to ensure it will not break ? Thanks :)
Open that test file and add a new testObject, say testObject2, that contains a property with a hyphen. Then ensure that calling JSPropertyProvider on the object doesn't return that property.

First time working with unit tests. Am I doing it right ?

This is perfect, thanks! Just a couple of minor style issues to fix.

Nit: space after the comma.
