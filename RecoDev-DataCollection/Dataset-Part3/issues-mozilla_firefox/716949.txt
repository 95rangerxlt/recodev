Thumbnails are currently stored in the file cache. Unfortunately, the file cache gets purged way too often (crash, force-quit, clear history [on shutdown], cache full). We need a way to pin special items (like our thumbnails) in the cache so that they don't get lost that easily.

Juts want to add another case in favour of this: the cache is cleared with a clean profile after the first restart on Windows, thus all thumbnails from sites visited in the first run will be blank after the first restart.

I highly recommend that you do not store these in the cache to start with. 

Realistically, there are always going to be times when we clear the disk cache due to one kind of crash or another. We (the networking team) are going to greatly reduce the frequency of these events. But, even that reduction is more than a quarter away. If you need a solution for this problem in Q2 then you should move the storage of the thumbnails elsewhere. If you can wait until Q3 then coordinate with Michal and Nick to see if they can promise a solution in Q3.

Thank you for your advice. We're going to build a custom thumbnail storage in the near future that won't use the file cache.
Will be fixed by bug 744388.
Fixed by bug 744388.
Since this is fixed, probably no longer deps on bug 105843.
