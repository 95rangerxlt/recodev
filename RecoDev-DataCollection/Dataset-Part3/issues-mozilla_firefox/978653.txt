When you update a style sheet in the Style Editor, a global transition rule is inserted in the document so that any changes to the page style will have a smooth transition.

bug 966805 is an orange caused by the Style Editor firing a 'style-applied' event before the style on the page is fully updated. It's instead fired in the middle of a transition.

Double wait time before firing 'style-applied'

Before we were waiting for the transition duration plus a small buffer. This patch increases the buffer. It also gets rid of a related line of code that wasn't being used.

As we use a global transition rule and we're blind to what rules change when we replace the text of the style sheet, there's no way to know if we should expect a transition to occur or how many should occur, so we can't listen for an event like 'transitionend'.

Increase wait time before firing 'style-applied'

Actually, thought it was odd that the buffer was a multiplier before. Small change to add a constant buffer time instead of making it a multiple of the transition duration.

If this solves the orange, then fine with me (I've re-launched a few bc runs on the try build).
However, I'd like to suggest that, for tests only, we introduce a mode where there are no transitions. This should reduce the chances for failures, right?

That's a good point. We used to a pref to turn off the transitions, but it wasn't being used. Maybe we should add it back.
