Even though I do not have the browser open, at times (this is a random occurance), XP reports that Firefox.exe is not responding and to restart the system.
Another proble, which is again random, is when I try to close the browser after going through a link which has PDF file, the OS reports that FIREFOXE.EXE is not responding and I have to close the task manually

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to open a link containing a PDF file (http://www.nasscom.org) has a lot of PDF file.
2.Go through the file and try to close the broswer
3. FIREFOX.EXE is not responding and I have to stop process manually

Actual Results:  
I had to manually kill the process from the task manager. However this is a random occurance. The more critical problem is whn the browser is not open and XP is running, at times (again random cannot be generated over and over again), XP comes with a message "FIREFOX.EXE is not responding. Please shutdwn the system and restart FIREFOX.EXE). I have done it after that process and I am sending this report, but it has happened several times earlier

Expected Results:  
1. Restarted the system for non responsive FIREFOX.EXE 
2. and in the first case, killed the process to shut down Firefox

The browser should have closed on click the lcose ICON.

The browser window should open, when Firefox is not running for problem No. 2
