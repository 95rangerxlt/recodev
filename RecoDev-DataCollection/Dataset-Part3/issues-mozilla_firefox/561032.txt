Since now the Firefox branding is tri-licensed, there is no reason to keep it in other-licenses. I think it is time to move it where it belongs, and that should be browser/branding/official.

This looks like you're effectively removing the official branding from l10n. Is that intended?

That's why I asked review from you, too.

In both l10n files, it looks like the browser directory is handled. Wouldn't the browser/branding/official directory fall into this ? In that case, the only worry would be the transition for translators, I really don't know how this works.
For the l10n infrastructure to work on these files as "browser", the branding files had to be in browser/locales/en-US/branding/official or so, but beneath browser/locales/en-US.

I'm not sure if the branding dir magic would work with that.

Patch v2

I take it that this would work, then. Would there be a problem with transition for translations ? Would it be worth, for example, having something handling the move in the l10n scripts ?
Looking at the code in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/config/config.mk#741, I expect that the relativesrcdir needs to be "browser", and then you need to fiddle with the jar.mn to actually start picking up for branding/official.

You'd really want to try to do some repacks locally, I'd suggest trying es-AR or fr from http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/. You'd do your normal build, but with a --l10n-base-dir=path/to/parent/of/fr argument to configure. Then you cd to browser/locales and do 
make installers-fr

That should do the magic and trigger the code at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/Makefile.in#190, which we use for repacks.

The other (not so common) path is to use --enable-ui-locale as an argument to configure, I guess both ways need to keep working.

Turning this into an actual r-, see my previous comment.

Actually, there is no need for that. Everything works fine with the patch as it was.
The only problems were with compare-locales, that use l10n and filter.py, with which the output is better if other-licenses/branding/firefox is left there, so that the output looks like:
fr
  browser/branding/official
    brand.dtd
        // add and localize this file
    brand.properties
        // add and localize this file
  other-licenses/branding/firefox
    brand.dtd
        // remove this file
    brand.properties
        // remove this file

As for --enable-ui-locale and make -C browser/locales installers-fr, both worked properly.

sorry, breaking compare-locales is an r-.

Patch v2.1

Misunderstood the previous comment, got all confused by my own code and modules on top of each other.

Seems to work in practice, so r=me.

I suppose we want a followup on removing the other-licenses/branding/firefox references at some point?
And a timeframe. When do we want this to land? FF6? Later?

Any reason not to land this right now?!

Because I'm not confident enough about the impact on the release process. Landing at the beginning of the 6-week train would help ensuring everything is fine before merging to aurora.
So I guess landing tomorrow would be good.

You can land it any time now, aurora has been branched.

Refreshed patch

Refreshed to fit context changes.
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/afc62991f24c
It looks like compare-locales is broken. After renaming the files to  browser/branding/official they are reported to be removed.
That's interesting. When I tried (but it was nearly a year ago), it worked fine.
So, what I did try last year was with a current l10n, and that still works:
$ ./compare-locales/scripts/compare-locales ./mozilla-central/browser/locales/l10n.ini ./l10n/ zh-TW
zh-TW
(snip)
  browser/branding/official
    brand.dtd
        // add and localize this file
    brand.properties
        // add and localize this file
(snip)
  other-licenses/branding/firefox
    brand.dtd
        // remove this file
    brand.properties
        // remove this file
(snip)

What doesn't work correctly, though, and that I apparently didn't test, is after updating the locale:

$ ./compare-locales/scripts/compare-locales ~/hg/mozilla-central/browser/locales/l10n.ini ./l10n/ fr
fr
  browser/branding/official
    brand.dtd
        // remove this file
    brand.properties
        // remove this file
  browser/branding/official/brand.properties
      +homePageImport
      +homePageMigrationDescription
      +homePageMigrationPageTitle
      +homePageSingleStartMain

It's interesting to see that on top of saying to remove the file, it *still* presents the new strings for brand.properties.

That does sound like a bug in compare-locales.
So, the root of the problem is that compare-locales can't distinguish, in the l10n directory, between something that originally was under browser/locales and something that originally was under browser/branding/official/locales.
