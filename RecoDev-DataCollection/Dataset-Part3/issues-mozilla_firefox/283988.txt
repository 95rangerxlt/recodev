When I enable the Checkbox only "dom.event.contextmenu.enabled" is set to true.
if I close the options dialog and open it again the checkbox is re-set to false,
but "dom.event.contextmenu.enabled" is still on true.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Options
2. Go to Content
3. Enable "But disable common annoyances" Javascript option
4. Close Options screen
5. Open option screen

Actual Results:  
Checkbox is not set AND only "dom.event.contextmenu.enabled" is set to true
("dom.disable_window_flip" and "dom.disable_window_move_resize" are not touched)

Expected Results:  
An enabled checkbox and the "dom.disable_window_move_resize",
"dom.event.contextmenu.enabled" and "dom.event.contextmenu.enabled" set to true?

I see this as well.

->New
It regressed in the 20050227 build (20050226 worked fine).

My JavaScript options extension has also stopped working in the current build
probably due to this bug. I wouldn't be surprised if there were other
preferences also not working.

My best guess would be that the onpreferencewrite handler isn't being used
correctly?

Its a bit odd, I have many checkboxes, all calling the same onpreferencewrite,
yet some work and some don't. Nothing shows in the javascript console.

Ok, sorry for that last comment, looks like my extension isnt seeing the
problem, unless its something intermittent.
