Unfortunately I and several other people forgot that strings can't really be removed on m-c vs. holly. If we don't fix this before uplift, in the case we need to use holly, the l10n problems will be pretty dire, in part because of how tools deal with repos (or don't, rather).

I just discussed with Francesco and it seems best to just get this over with ASAP before uplift.

Some of these are Australis changes, some of them are Fx accounts changes, some are Metro changes, so I'm CC'ing some folks.

browser-l10n

I just merged m-c tip to holly.

As best I can tell, this is a diff of the browser l10n files from holly to m-c.

As best I can tell, any removal (ie lines with -) that isn't readded in the "Strings to be removed post-australis" section at the end of browser.dtd, is wrong.

(I've manually removed all diff sections that just had additions, except for the aforementioned 'remove post-australis' section)
switchToMetroCmd2.label is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=950730#c7
It was added to Holly and mozilla-aurora but never to mozilla-central

Changes to preferences.properties and sync seem to me only a matter of timing (I recall finding these strings yesterday morning).

So basically it should be enough to restore deleted strings in browser.dtd in the soon-to-be-gone bucket (openLocationCmd.*, bookmarksMenuButton.tooltip) and aboutPrivateBrowsing.dtd, restore openLocation.*

This doesn't make sense to me. The holly and m-c revs were in sync before creating the diff - there should be no difference between the two anymore. Any differences that still appear are likely there to stay. :-(
I think we should add this one, just merged

This is the changeset from bug 966511
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/08ef155181f6

I could be wrong but all FxAccounts changed strings are from there.

Ah. But I had to back that out on holly because it conflicted. I can see if I can un-backout just the relevant bits, but that should probably get a separate review.
Created attachment 8369199
fix up Australis-removed strings in browser.dtd, aboutPrivateBrowsing.dtd, openLocation files,

This does the easy bits, which is basically comment #2 and comment #4. I'll look at that backed out cset separately.

toolkit-l10n

Then there are the toolkit diffs, those are universally my own fault. :-(
Created attachment 8369250
resurrect toolkit strings deleted by Australis on m-c,

So these should go back, too. Checking the rest of the tree now (but don't expect anything there)

Looking at your browser-l10n diff, this seems fine to me.

I think the last one is a duplicate? Seems to be defined above.

Fortunately, nothing else was different in any other directories, as far as I was able to tell.

I'm still seeing a difference on determiningStatus.label (browser/preferences/sync.dtd) between holly and central
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=966511#c6

Everything else looks good, ignoring some some strings in devtools that probably didn't land yet on holly (debugger.properties, netmonitor.properties).

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/44ba69cacd7e -- that still needs merging to Holly, too, so we should be OK.
... after some merges and relanding bug 952277, I think we should be good now.
Yes, I see only additions in files, both /toolkit and /browser, so we should be good.
