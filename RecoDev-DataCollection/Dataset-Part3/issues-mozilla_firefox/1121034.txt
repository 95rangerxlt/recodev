patch

Currently, breakpoint conditions are passed inside a location object. They really should be passed as a separate argument, since they have nothing to do with locations at all.

This bug is part of the cleanup of the breakpoint code, and should make it easier to implement breakpoint sliding on original locations later.

To be clear, this doesn't affect the protocol, right?

Bumping this over to James.

r+ We've been needing to do this for a while. I don't see anything wrong in here. This doesn't change the protocol (`onSetBreakpoint` still takes an object with all the location and condition info).
