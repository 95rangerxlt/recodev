It is the on;y -aero.css left, so removing this will remove this aero dependency to overrides for .css files
There's no such file in the Firefox theme. Toolkit's downloads-aero.css has been removed in bug 1150006.
Ugh, the component story here is super confusing.

/r/7023 - Bug 1154218 - get rid of webapprt's downloads-aero.css, r?dao,baku

Pull down this commit:

hg pull -r 0af11f1e1037a24d20a1d2787c74787a6c549fe6 https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/gecko/
Apologies for the binary file stupidities, but I'm hoping that at least now with the actual cset I won't have trouble committing this like DÃ£o did with some previous bugs. Essentially what the change is doing is moving the non-suffixed assets to -XP, and the -aero-suffixed assets to be unsuffixed, and then updating the overrides to be XP-only. This matches what we've done in the main browser theme and should make it easier to maintain the code in conjunction with the browser code.

I cannot review this code. Sorry.

Assuming the image changes are correct (I don't know yet how this new review tool works, the image changes are stripped from the diff file) and the patch has been tested, this looks good to me.

I am pretty sure the code changes are correct from a logical perspective, but I have no idea how to test this. How can I test this? :-)

You can simply host this app somewhere (localhost for example), install it, launch it and then see if downloading still works.

Thanks! Had to tweak it a bit, but worked it out in the end. Tested and landed.
