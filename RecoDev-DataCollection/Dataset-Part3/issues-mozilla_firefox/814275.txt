+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #813533 +++

I find a special case which is not fixed in Bug #813533

Enviroment:
*Firefox Nightly 20.
 http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4f19e7fd8bea
*Intel Mac OS X 10.8

Step to reproduce:
1) open window 'A' & turn on Private-browsing.
2) close window 'A' (but keep running Firefox in dock).
3) open a new window 'B' with "clicking dock icon".
   if you opened one with context-menu or menubar, this bug does not appear.
4) open a URL in window 'B'.

Result:
The opened URL is recorded in browsing history.

My suspicion is that this now works in builds compiled from mozilla-aurora tip, given the backout we performed there.
Sigh. There are a nontrivial amount of places in nsBrowserContentHandler.js that open windows directly and will cause similar breakage (including other situations such as performing a search from the Windows 7 start menu). I'm putting together a patch that sets the privacy status of new windows in nsWindowWatcher based on the global service value.

When the global service matters, force all new windows to conform to the global private browsing state.

I have come to the conclusion that there are far too many ways new windows can be opened in Firefox.

Nit: please use if(...)foo=bar; instead of the bit-op here.

Fine, I won't give you generous drive-by reviews any more.  :P

I tried your patch. This patch fixes the case which I reported, and following case: opening a new window via opening links other applications when Firefox is in OSX dock.
This patch will fix well. Thank you! (if I find other pattern, then I'll report it immediately.)

I reproduce this bug on Aurora (http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/4e0a8f234a6d).

Hmm, that's not expected...  Josh?

Phew!  :-)

Josh, we don't need this for Aurora, right?
Correct.
