dependentlibs.list now lives under Contents/Resources instead of Contents/MacOS since it is a data file. We need to fix up our XPCOM glue code to pick this up properly.

Will request reviews once we've fixed up all the other dependencies that have been broken by the new bundle structure.

This needs more comments about we're modifying tempBuffer and what the goal of this code is.

Oh how we need a C++ library equivalent of python os.path.

Addressed feedback.

Try push is almost completely green, so requesting review (updater xpcshell test failures and gaia python integration test suite failures are handled in separate bugs):

Why did this change from an #ifdef to an #if? I believe #ifdef is still the standard for these.

Please put this back or explain why it had to change, r=me

Oops, I meant to change this from an #if defined() to an #ifdef, but forgot to add 'def' after removing the defined(). Thanks for catching this!
