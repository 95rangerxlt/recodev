Steps to reproduce:

Using Aurora 20.0a2 (2013-02-19)
I clicked a hyperlink in email or messenger client


Actual results:

The link opened in a new aurora window


Expected results:

It should have opened in a new tab, as all my preferences are set that way.

Also, I have noticed the issue only happens when I am using private browsing mode.

Can you provide a page that reproduces this behaviour for you?
Any URL will do.
To reproduce, make sure settings are set to open new windows in a new tab instead and turn private browsing on, then click a link in an email or something.  It ignores the settings and open in a new window.

Then try it again without private browsing and it will open in a new tab as expected.
A URL that demonstrates this problem for you would help us ensure that we're performing the same tests that you are.
For example, despite my test page at http://joshmatthews.net/newtab.html opening a new window with the "Open new windows as tabs" setting disabled, I do not see the problem you describe with it enabled in private browsing mode in nightly builds.
I was just using http://www.google.com.  Just to clarify, I'm talking about clicking a link in an external application in my case Fraise which is just a text editor.
It's also possible the issue has been fixed in the nightly build as I'm using the Aurora update channel.
Ok, can you be more explicit about the windows you have open when you see this problem? To be clear, external links will never open in a private window. If no non-private window exists, I would expect a new one to be spawned.
Also, my apologies: I apparently skimmed over both the title of the bug and your first comment, because you made it pretty clear that the problem was with links being opened from other applications. I'll work on my reading comprehension skills in the future.
Hmm. I've been using private browsing as the default for awhile now, but never noticed external links opening in new windows until the last month or so.  But if that's the behavior that's always been there that's just the way it is I guess.
Do you mean that you're running in permanent private browsing mode (ie. Settings -> Privacy -> Never Remember History)?
Yeah actually that is correct.  Also the issue doesn't happen if I have it set to Settings -> Privacy -> Remember History
This is a legitimate oddity you've pointed out. I think we'll special-case perma-private mode when opening external links to make the experience more pleasant. Thanks for raising the issue!
Thank you!
