Yahoo!'s GameChannel and StatTracker alike will not update at all automatically.  I have to go in and restart GameChannel whenever I would like to see the updates on there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/gamechannel?lid=189984&type=mlb&matchid=
2. When an event occurs that should update the GameChannel, it doesn't update.
3.
Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Update when changes occur to each game.
