open it and it does not open the last tab

open the tab bookmark "bugreport" and reproduce it. the malformed url is
imported from galeon.
I have a similar scenario which I thought I should add here rather than create
another bug.

Version: Firefox 0.9 release on Windows ME

How to reproduce:
1. Create a bookmarks folder with several bookmarks in it (say 10).
2. In this bookmarks folder, add a bookmark to a local HTML file.
3. Move the bookmark to local file so that it appears halfway down the folder
listing.
4. Move/rename the local HTML file that the bookmark points to (thereby making
the bookmark invalid).
5. Start with a new browser window.
6. Select "Open in tabs" on the bookmarks folder.

Result:
Tabs are created for all the bookmarks up and including the local bookmark. At
which point the following error message appears:

"The file /C:/<filename> cannot be found. Please check the location and try again."

This error message halts the "open in tabs" operation, and the rest of the
bookmarks in the folder are not loaded in tabs.

Expected result:
All the bookmarks in the folder should be opened in tabs. The error message
should appear for the local bookmark, but this should not prevent the rest of
the bookmarks from loading.

Additional information:
If the user has selected "open in tabs", he will expect all the pages to appear
in new tabs. The fact that he has an invalid local bookmark should not cause the
action to halt prematurely.

I suggest that the following would be a better summary for this bug:

"An error during "Open in Tabs" operation will prevent the remaining bookmarks
in the folder from being loaded"
