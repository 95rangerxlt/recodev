I get the same error trying to use it in the web console, so I think it's legit broken:

navigator.registerProtocolHandler("mailto","https://www.fastmail.com/action/compose/?mailto=%s","FastMail");

I have a custom protocol handler (for magnet: scheme) in an addon and it apparently stops working with e10s, although I see no errors in the console.  Works fine in nightly with autostart.1 pref set to false, but just stops handling magnet links when e10s is enabled.
Would like to add FireBible to the list of affected extensions. The sword:// & bible:// protocols that FireBible adds no longer work with e10s enabled, pretty much breaking the extension entirely. http://thegoan.com/firebible

Use the Services jsm to simplify a few lines.

There were a few places that could be simplified by using Services.

wip for registerProtocolHandler

This should make registerProtocolHandler work, I still need to test it in the e10s case. Unfortunately it appears that test_registerHandler.html requires registerContentHandler to work as well. I have a plan for making that work, dealing with pref branch observers that I'll base on top of this patch.
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=72e2a85fafe1
Does this bug, or will this fix, also cover registerProtocolHandler with nsIProtocolHandler?
Ian, I don't think this bug will affect that. What API, exactly are you talking about?
I think you're right.  I've finally got a custom scheme working in my addon using the component registrar in a frame script.  It doesn't work from a javascript component any more.  It wasn't working in a frame script, now it is.  I don't know what I was doing wrong.

Small patch to the test

This test passes the parameters to is() backwards, making it confusing to debug. I corrected that. While I was here, I fixed a todo() that wasn't written correctly either, that became a todo_is, like the rest of them.

Dao, you're the last person to review anything in this file, please let me know if there's a better reviewer for these patches.

I'm playing a little fast and loose with the URI stuff, but I think it's correct.

Fix an odd bug

According to the comment I'm removing, this isn't supposed to throw, but the function returns undefined in this case and nobody checks for it, so we'd throw anyway. Furthermore, according to the current spec[1], we are supposed to throw.

Enable this test on e10s.

With these patches, this test now passes.
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=76161d332813

With these patches, registerContentHandler should work, but I still need to implement nsIWebContentConverterService for the feed page to work properly (the current implementation will try to set prefs from the content process. It should be possible to do this with relatively little work and some refactoring (plus some pref observers). Should I do that in this bug?

You can use Services.io here.

You can also get rid of the underscore prefixes for these method names since Utils isn't exported from this script.

You could use browserElement.getTabBrowser().getNotificationBox(browserElement) here like you did elsewhere.

Using the nightly build: 42.0a1 (2015-08-04) - my protocol handler is still defunct when e10s is enabled. Is this issue supposed to be fixed in the above build, or have I misunderstood the extent of the fix?

I see a "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because one of the following protocols (bible) isn't associated with any program or is not allowed in this context." error. Can't see any protocol related errors in the log though.

When e10s is disabled, the protocol handler works just fine.

Extension can be installed from: http://thegoan.com/firebible for testing - the extension signing check will need to be disabled.
A quick look at your code suggests that FireBible is not using a web content protocol handler.  It is using a chrome custom protocol handler (nsIProtocolHandler).  This is the same confusion I had.  This bug is not relevant. Look at the latest beta versions of my addon for code that works (frame.js is the frame script, frame.jsm contains the handler):
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/torrent-status-tool/

To the best of my knowledge, the only way to use these with e10s enabled is to manually register your protocol handler in a frame script.  I could not find as way to do this using the old chrome.manifest registration.  Protocol handlers registered in a component exist but are never called to handle content.
Ian, appreciate the explanation, thank you. It does look like the the nsIProtocolHandler issue is being addressed in bug #1176646 though, so I can wait on a fix there before testing further; hopefully changes to the extension will not be required.
