Here's what's left to do :
- Network sidebar toggle icon
- Stop black boxing this source button in Debugger (this uses the image="" attribute, so it's a bit harder)
- Style Editor and Shader Editor Eye icon.

I couldn't think of anything more.

Part 1 : Network monitor

I haven't done the eyeballs yet, since I'm getting conflicts when applying your patch, so I'm probably gonna wait for it to land on m-c.

And for the debugger stop black boxing source button, I couldn't figure out a good solution yet. Do you know what could be possible ? I thought of checking retina after load, then change the image="" attribute if it's a retina screen.

Are you talking about black-boxed-message-button?  If so, I'd say let's move that into CSS instead of debugger.xul.

Also, could you remove the file themes/devtools/shared/images/debugger-blackBoxMessageEye.png?  I don't think it is in use anymore.

I'm getting rejects applying the patch - somehow :).  Also, I think this is actually doubling the size of the icon when in 2x mode after looking at it.

I haven't tested the patch yet unfortunatly, I had to do a full rebuild.
This patch addresses the following :
- Removes some references to background-noise-toolbar.png
- Adds HDPI support for the network monitor
- Adds HDPI support for the style and shader editors
- Removes the file you asked

It doesn't address the debugger black box button yet.

I can't seem to fix this issue. I tried to adjust the height and width, but no luck. Maybe I should switch to background-image ?

Yes, I would switch to background-image

If you'd rather stick with list-style-image - there are plenty of places in browser/themes using list-style-image in this context, so I know it is possible.  If you search for '2dppx' you will see them.

Not sure why, but I get an error applying to styleeditor: '1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file browser/themes/shared/devtools/styleeditor.css.rej'.

Otherwise, it looks good once the 2x icon for netmonitor.inc.css is worked out.

Looks good - were you also going to update black-boxed-message-button in this patch?
