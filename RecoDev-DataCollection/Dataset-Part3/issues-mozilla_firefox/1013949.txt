Depending on whether a variable/property is configurable, enumerable or writable, dashed underlines of different colors are added. Since this information is not *that* important most of the time, and it's accessible anyway via a tooltip, it might be a good idea to remove the visual noise.

Panos, what do you think? Should we remove everything except WebIDL, or simply all the underlining?

I think removing the underlining and keeping the tooltip info makes the most sense. I rarely remember what the dashes and colors actually mean, so I always consult the tooltip :-)
