Turns out that listening for "oop-browser-crashed" in SessionStore and then adding |browser.permanentKey| to a WeakSet didn't work because |updateBrowserRemoteness()| assigns a new permanentKey. I assume that tearing down the <browser> and re-inserting into the tree somehow causes the field to be re-initialized.

I'm actually surprised this works. I would have thought that we'd have to change the permanentKey after adding the element back into the DOM. I guess this is fine if it works, though.
Yeah, me too. But it does. That reminds me I should add a test to ensure that :)

I did that explicitly before putting it back into the DOM to have a correct .permanentKey before the first setupSyncHandler message arrives, which I believe would be synchronous at least with an InProcessTabChildGlobal.

Extended browser_e10s_switchbrowser.js to ensure this works and doesn't break in the future. Ensured locally that the test does indeed break without the patch applied.
