User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

This problem occurs on 2 of my 4 computers.  When several Firefox windows are
open and each window has several tabs, the last or sometimes even the next
Firefox window will hang when the windows are being closed window by window. 
For example, I had 8 windows open each with about 12 - 20 tabs.  I notice that
this problem can be intermittent, but definitely will occur when Firefox has
been running for a while, say 24 hours, with all these windows and tabs open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open several windows, say 5, each with more than 10 tabs.
2.Wait 24 hours
3.Start closing Firefox windows.  The last window will not close, and Firefox
hangs.  

Actual Results:  
I had to use Task Manager to shut down Firefox.exe

Expected Results:  
All Firefox windows should have cloed, and Firefox should have stopped running.

A hang is significantly different to a crash.

If you do mean crash then:

Please can you use the instructions at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Talkback to
install the talkback client, then when firefox crashes send the incident and
copy the incident ID from /components/talkback.exe in the firefox directory to
this bug.

Also you might want to try firefox safe mode:
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_mode
incase this is caused by an extension.
works for me with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9a6pre) Gecko/20070610 Minefield/3.0a6pre ID:2007061004 [cairo]

Resolving this as works for me since no Feedback for comment #1.

Ted, if you still crash with a recent release like Firefox 2.0.0.4, fell free to reopen. Please see also comment #1. A Talkback Id would be great if you still crash.
Next versions of Firefox no longer produced the problem.
