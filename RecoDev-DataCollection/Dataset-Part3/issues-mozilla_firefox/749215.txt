Install the debug server jsms as symlinks, when appropriate.

At the moment, the debugger Makefile.in copies the JSMs in toolkit/devtools/debugger and toolkit/devtools/debugger/server into dist/bin/modules/devtools. It should symlink them in, to make development easier.

Note that the "ac_add_options --enable-chrome-format=symlink" doesn't provide this functionality. I'm not sure why, but those JSMs aren't installed in the same way as the .js files.

Talos sent me email claiming that I'd regressed performance. I wept for several days, but then gathered my wits about me and looked at this chart:

http://graphs-new.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=[[196,64,21]]&sel=none&displayrange=30&datatype=running

and decided that my commit, on May 1st, was not responsible for the regression.
there there, jim. Talos can't hurt you anymore.
