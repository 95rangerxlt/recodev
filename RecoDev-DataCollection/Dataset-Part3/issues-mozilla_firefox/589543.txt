It's already in-litmus, in fact to the extent they still exist it's a smoketest, since there's a "You should be taken to a page which has UI at the top with a light yellow background that allows you to select the feed reader you want to use." step in https://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?id=10126

Fix v.1

Seems like the test would be better off as a browser-chrome test, but I won't be picky. (Are the enablePrivilege calls really needed?)
It's a miserable document to work with, and maybe it would have been less miserable from browser-chrome, even though it's really more content than chrome. UniversalXPConnect (or at least something more powerful than UniversalBrowserRead) is needed to avoid "Security Manager vetoed action arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentXBL.getAnonymousElementByAttribute]", and you're right, I didn't need UniversalBrowserRead for whatever I'd first added it for, with that.
