The inner vertical padding of the identity box is too small, causing the height of the address bar on Windows and Linux to be different if there are no other elements on the toolbar.

I've tested this on Windows and OSX and it seems to work fine, and does cause popup windows nav height to match normal windows.  As far as I understand, this is restoring the margin size previous to Bug 1185362 so it shouldn't cause any problems
