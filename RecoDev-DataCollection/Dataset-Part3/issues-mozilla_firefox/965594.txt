Noticed this go by in my terminal-spew, when starting up mochitests:
{
JavaScript strict warning: file:///[path]/obj/dist/bin/components/Weave.js, line 84: setting a property that has only a getter
}

The line of code is:
> 84       this.fxAccountsEnabled = false;
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/services/sync/Weave.js?rev=974df2f038ae#84
and it was added in bug 959548.

I think the warning is saying that the assignment there is ineffective (?)

The warning is actually saying it is naughty :)  But it works.

This will be fixed when part 2 of bug 959222 lands.
Fixed some time ago - we no longer set this.fxAccountsEnabled
