is why this is failing, apparently. Trying to figure out why now...
Ah, so this is because the button ends up in the customization target (an hbox inside the toolbar), and then it keeps the parentNode and tries to insertItem into that - but it's an hbox, not a toolbar, which is why this breaks. I'll check if we can potentially fix this on the browser side...

Extend customization targets to support insertItem

This is slightly frightening, but it works perfectly.

I suppose this does assume that something calls that getter before someone tries to insert into the customization target; I'm not sure if that assumption is problematic (it isn't in practice, in my testing, but it's an interesting assumption).

If we don't like this assumption, though, we should probably change the customization target's property to be less lazy and extend the target in _init or something like this.

Can we change this to:

> if (!this._customizationTarget) {
>   this._customizationTarget = this;
>   this._customizationTarget.insertItem = this.insertItem.bind(this);
> }

That way we can just do this the first time that the property is accessed?

The assumption thing is weird, but I'm ok with it for now.
(In reply to Jared Wein [:jaws] from comment #4)

Sorry, I misunderstood the patch. r=me, but maybe switch the order so that the truthy condition comes first.

if (this._customizationTarget)
  ...insertItem = ...
else
  ... = this;
