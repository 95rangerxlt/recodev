Not a duplicate, because bug 624129 - for x86 Windows 7
This bug on Windows XP.
It's the same code. Even though Windows XP still uses the menubar as default, it can also display the tabs in the titlebar (otherwise you wouldn't have seen the bug in the first place).
Same code, quite different bug report.
Dup of bug 624225 instead?
Just note: under Windows 7, the bug is not exposed. Firefox 4 under Windows XP should behave just the same as under Windows 7.

Tab clickability face to face to top screen edge with no any unclickable gaps is very important for usability of tabs placed in titlebar.

This bug ONLY under Windows XP !
In Windows 7 all OK.

This is exactly what is my comment about.
I think this should be a softblocker for XP. It's not the default toolbar state but for those who do switch, it's an unfortunate shortcoming in a very common usage case.

Johnath, here's another one for your list.

Windows XP - 120 DPI

I'm running Windows XP on a laptop set to a DPI setting of "Large size (120
DPI)" and the different is a lot worse.  Tabs only take up about 60% the title
bar.

I never even realized it was supposed to take up the entire title bar.
Just to give you some values of the different elements heights on my machine:

1. The titlebar vbox has a height of 32px.
2. The TabsToolbar toolbar has a height of 23px.
3. The tab-view-deck deck has a height of 1158px.
4. The entire window has a height of 1170px.
New branding changes triggered this bug again.
Re-opening as per comment 19.
Bug 640490 has been backed out, closing again.
