Let's increase the size of Reader's default type size by one increment, this would in turn eliminate the smallest (unreadable value) and provide a larger max size.

Why did you need to change this from body to #container?
Because _setFontSize sets the font-sizeN on the container, not the body, at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/reader/AboutReader.jsm#362  (And that was changed so that we didn't repaint the toolbar when we changed the font-size as part of bug 1149520.)  I'm not entirely sure how the code was working before…

Doh, I just noticed this myself while working on the patch for bug 1158194. This must be a regression I introduced in bug 1154028.
Oy. Sorry for missing that. :-\

Approving for uplift to aurora and to beta (from discussion with Sylvestre) because we want this to be in the  38.0.5 but not in 38.0 since Reader Mode is disabled for 38.0 on Desktop.

Isn't this 38, and beta 38.0.5 ? Did I miss another memo? :-\

(neither were marked 'fixed' with this comment, which is presumably also an issue)
beta merged to release yesterday
Towkir please mention which build did you check the fix.
build of the fixed version is  :   20150521175336

Thanks :)
