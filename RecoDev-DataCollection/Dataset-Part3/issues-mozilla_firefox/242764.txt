Everytime I close the firefox program down, it crashes and brings up an illegal
operation error displaying the text:

FIREFOX caused an invalid page fault in
module KERNEL32.DLL at 0197:bff9da1a.

This happens every time I shut down the program, and perhaps only on
Windows98se. This was a fresh install of the OS too, only a few weeks old.

When I click on the close button, it doesn't do anything except re-fo the error
window again. It stuck in an infinite loop and I can only get rid of it by
restarting the OS.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Go to a webpage - optional
3. Close firefox

Actual Results:  
Brings up illegal operation error.

Expected Results:  
Closed properly and not bugged me again.

Unable to reproduce with the latest firefox and windows 98. 
powastryker@icqmail.com, can you reproduce this with Mozilla builds? If so, does
it trigger a talkback report?
I have since reinstalled Windows98 and no more problems. I think it was caused
by the Windows Security Update cd which I installed right after a fresh install
of Win98 a week earlier.

Everything works ok now on a fresh install without update cd.
