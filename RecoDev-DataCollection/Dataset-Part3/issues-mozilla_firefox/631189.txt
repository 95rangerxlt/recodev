I guess we could want a min-height on the page.

Patch v1

This hides the 'About Mozilla' link when the screen gets too small. I also tweaked things such that the 'About Mozilla' link doesn't overlap the 'Restore Previous Session' button for a ~470px window.

Patch v1

Review of attachment 549637:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

the patch looks good, but trying to resize the page, the jump due to the searchbox height change becomes too much visible.
Thus I suggest that in addition to this we also replace:

@media all and (max-height: 450px) {
  #searchContainer { height: 30% }
}

with:

@media all and (max-height: 500px) {
  #searchContainer { height: 25% }
}

@media all and (max-height: 370px) {
  #searchContainer { height: 30% }
}

for a smoother balancing on resize (and to balance your top change at 500px)

Patch v2

Updated patch with suggestion.

I noticed the jumpiness too while testing; I'm not sure this change reduces it by much, but it does make things look more balanced.
In my queue, pushing to inbound once confirmed everything builds locally.
s/everything/everything else/

Also, for future patches, can you check your hgrc is set up like here:
blog.bonardo.net/2010/06/22/so-youre-about-to-use-checkin-needed
...since the current patch was missing the |# HG changeset patch| line, which causes hg qimport to break and put the author in the commit field etc.

Thanks :-)
