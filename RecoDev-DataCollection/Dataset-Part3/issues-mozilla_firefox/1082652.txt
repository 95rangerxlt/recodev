When a touch gesture occurs inside an app, the events are of course dispatched to the app, but the system app can also listen for the touchstart/touchend.

Some features are built on top of this, and in order to write tests for them we need b2g-desktop to implement the same behavior.

I'm making sure we listen for touchstart/touchend (including those coming from marionette) then redispatch them to the system app only when they're not already targeted at it.

What do you think?

Sorry for the noise, this is the correct version of the patch.

Looks good. Hopefully that's the last hack on this pile!

nit: would have called this one sysWindow.

Patch - Revert "Bug 1082652 - [b2g-desktop] to match on device behavior, touchstart/touchend should always be dispatched on the system app too"

Going to look to see if I can figure out how to address the failures in our Gij tests before landing this, but if I can't, then I suggest backing out to get to the last known "good" state.

On try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=e27533451ac8
New try run as I didn't select the right options apparently: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=55d4f283179c
If these green up we should be good: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=55d4f283179c&showall=1&searchQuery=b2g_ubuntu64_vm%20try%20opt%20test%20gaia-js-integration
Backed out in 
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/b2g-inbound/rev/fc8e45f09f78
Oh gosh I'm sorry, this was clearly failing (and being hidden) on the try-build :/
Merge of backout:

New try build now that the gaia fix landed:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=08a9f03696f2

How come this try syntax triggers windows xp build?
Hum.. looks like my gaia fix wasn't landed yet, new try build:

Gij green on the last try build (retriggered 2 intermittents, now green).
