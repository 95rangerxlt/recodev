For the next Pocket release Marketing would like to have the remaining en-* locales shipped and turned on such that we can be globally working in english language variants.  This helps with english press around the globe who run similar stories but currently won't have access to the feature.

I don't believe this depends on bug 1161138 but if that were to land we might get the additional locales as part of the process.

en-GB and en-ZA are the only other en-* locales I'm aware of that we're missing.

Dolske had recommended continuing to use the locale framework we currently have considering the 39 time frame.

Pike: should I file separate bugs for each of these locales?
I'm not sure what the status is for 39 and en-GB. Ian?

My suspicion is that whatever we do for en-GB is gonna be fine for en-ZA, CCing Dwayne to make sure.

I don't think that we'll need an extra bug, and given how well-known the differences are, I would actually suggest that we do the patch by our engineers and just ask Ian for review.

locale changes for 39 have landed now for en-GB.

Seems very straight forward, so which ever way is easier.

I assume you're talking about the general L10N state of en-GB in Firefox 39? There are no localizable Pocket strings (at least in the normal L10N system sense), since they're currently hardcoded for the supported languages. Bug 1161138 won't fix that in Firefox 39 or 40.

Also, do we need to have actual translations (different strings), or can we just use the existing en-US strings? I ain't no expert in the Queen's English, but it seems like the existing strings would have few -- if any -- changes, and so we should just add code to use en-US instead of duplicating things. But either is fine.

Assuming this is what we want to do (see previous comment), this is basically the same thing we did in as bug 1164407.

The horrour!
Nothing needs changing specifically for en-GB with the current strings.
Ok, let's land this then.

Patch v.1

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: Pocket remains unavailable in the UK / South Africa locales.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: n/a
[Risks and why]: None, really.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: No L10N impact, still hardcoded strings.
(Note that this patch doesn't need to land on Nightly/41, because bug 1161138 is changing Pocket to the normal L10N flow there.)

Patch v.1

Approved for uplift to aurora and beta.

Marking for verification to do a quick check for Pocket on en-GB and en-ZA in the next Beta.
I've verified this on Firefox 39 Beta 5, on Windows 7 x64, Mac OS X 10.8.5, and Ubuntu 14.04 x64. The en-GB and en-ZA builds now show the Pocket button by default, in the toolbar, and I can login and save pages to Pocket. I've also tried update from 38.0.5 and 38.0 on Windows, and the Pocket button gets added and works without issues after the update is performed.

Will there also be a What's New page for these two localizations? Similar to what we had in bug 1135820, with Pocket info.
Not sure -- Cory?

Wasn't the whatsnew page only for 38.0.5? I wouldn't expect it for beta. Also, the list of locales was hard-coded (some had a video, others Pocket, other Pocket+video).
(In reply to Justin Dolske [:Dolske] from comment #17)
> Not sure -- Cory?

If Pocket is now available for these two locales, we can add them to the Whats New Page. It would take requesting releng to include these two URL's, and some code on bedrock.

As far as the life expectancy of whatsnew, I think this is currently TBD. We could add these locales mid release though.

NI dolske - is Pocket up and running for en-ZA and en-GB release channel?
No, this en-ZA and eb-GB won't be in release channel until 39 ships at the end of the month.
