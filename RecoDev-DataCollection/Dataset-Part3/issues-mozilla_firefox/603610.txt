Seeing a lot of these interspersed with other tests after landing of bug 581069.
Taking the bug. It's a test I wrote.

proposed fix

Proposed fix. Now it gets the chance to actually check if the document has focus after closing the Web Console. (3 tests pass, instead of only 2) Also, the notificationBox variable being null error is fixed.

This is a test-only change and does not require toolkit peer review.
landed and backed out:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/toolkit/components/console/hudservice/tests/browser/browser_webconsole_bug_588342_document_focus.js | content document has focus - Got [object XrayWrapper [object Window]], expected [object Window]
Oops, sorry! That must be a problem with the new XrayWrappers that I did not expect. I have tested the patch a few days ago. Tomorrow I'll rebase and fix the patch.
I think we have a lot of issues that we need to iron out with this new wrapper type. arrggh.

Hehe, no worries. I'll do hg pull from m-c tomorrow and rebase all test fixes I have waiting to be checked-in, ironing out the issues with this new wrapper type.
I disabled the test: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/249a1313aa52
disabled the test but didn't reland? This fix should be safe to checkin now, with that test disabled, right?

We should add that test to the list of bugs to fix and land in bug 604536. Adding there.
I didn't reland the patch, no. I don't know what exactly is left to do here or in bug 604536 -- my main interest was to stop the mochitest-browser-chrome log pollution.
yep fair enough. I'll reland with some other fixes this morning.
