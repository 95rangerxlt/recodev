If you starting typing a url which , starts from "ab"... , Awesomebar suggest "about:blank" for "Switch To Tab" , when typed from a blank page , which i don't think is desired. Why would a user type "about:blank" just to get a blank page , or even want to jump to a blank page already opened ?

This is my perception , would like UX team to consider this

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a blank page. 
2.Type about in awesomebar (url bar)

Actual Results:  
You find about:blank (switch to tab) in the dropdown list

sorry for the typo*
Could be a dupe of bug 558626.
This is mostly the same as bug 555694 (showing current tab in results). I don't think that we need to special case about:blank - not showing the current tab would fix the majority of the problem
I tend to agree with comment 3.  This is not exactly a dupe of bug 555694, but a fix there will resolve this issue.  Resolving this as WONTFIX.

This dependency can be expressed in bugzilla.
On a related note, I'm unable to reproduce this bug. Is it just me or did something else already fix this by now?

I'm able to reproduce this quite easily.

On Mac:
1. CMD+T
2. Type "about" into awesomebar
3. Select Switch-to-tab result for "about:blank"
Updating the summary to reflect the issue more accurately.
Ok, I can reproduce with a different profile.

However, suggesting about:blank if it's not the current tab doesn't seem helpful either, nor does it actually work (bug 555694 won't solve this).
