The patch

This patch removes the remaining uses of Add-on SDK Promises in the Firefox for Desktop front-end code.

The only test that needed to be changed was the sanitizer. The production code was logically correct, but the test assumed synchronous processing when clicking the OK button.

Won't this result in the window staying open if the promise is rejected? That wasn't the intent of the old code...

As I read it, if the sanitize promise is rejected it goes reportError, but in any case both success or failure go through window.close(). The third then is to handle window.close exceptions.
