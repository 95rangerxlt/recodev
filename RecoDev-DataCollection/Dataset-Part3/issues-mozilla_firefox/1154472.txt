+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1153900 +++

At least for me on Win8, the expiry time is turned into a date which we pass to Services.cookies.add, which turns it into a timestamp, which we then multiply by 1000 before turning it back into a date, leading to it being really high (year 40000-odd).

I'm not sure if this is a regression or not, but from the code I suspect it's been like this for a long time, and nobody noticed...

I guess the usual timestamp vs PRTime...

Btw, I have ctypes working for the test, I can set a cookie with an expire time, so this should be testable too.
Tested, upcoming patch fixes things on my local Win8 IE11 machine. I'll report back with a WinXP test
in a bit, but it seems likely that this is the correct fix everywhere - if the format had changed on the IE side, the new Date() call would never have worked in the first place, I assume...

Actually... while we're here, I think this gets timezones wrong still? Maybe? Let me doublecheck...

Yup, both debugging and https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724280%28v=vs.85%29.aspx indicate that this will be returning UTC, and the new Date() constructor will use local time. I'll update the patch.

nit: I'm fine if you wish to shorthand to

fileTimeToSecondsSinceEpoch(aTimeHi, aTimeLo) {
