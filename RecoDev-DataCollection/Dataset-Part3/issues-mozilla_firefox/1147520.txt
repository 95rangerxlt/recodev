User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20150320092323

Steps to reproduce:

Fedora 21
firefox-36.0.3-1.fc21.x86_64
gnome-shell-3.14.3-1.fc21.x86_64
Lenovo X1 Carbon, HiDPI Screen (2560x1440)

Certain icons show up misaligned on FF 36 on Fedora 21 on a HiDPI screen at 2x font scaling. You can see this on https://access.redhat.com and http://cnn.com.


Actual results:

On Firefox 36 on my F21 system with 2x scaling, the icons are misaligned. Please see screenshot 1 and 2.


Expected results:

On Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and other browsers on a different Mac OSX machine, and Google Chrome on F21 (same system), the icons (wrench, magnifying glass, briefcase, etc) are centered.

My friendly neighborhood web dev claims "Icon-font pseudo-elements have issues with line-height and alignment with parent element". This means very little to me. All I know is the icons show up centered in the shaded circle in other browsers, but not on this HiDPI system.
