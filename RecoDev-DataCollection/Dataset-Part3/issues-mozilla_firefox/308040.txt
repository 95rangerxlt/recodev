I'm having this problem in both the trunk and branch. I've seen Bug #291154, but
it doesn't mention the "View Cookies" aspect.

I have all the selections in the "Clear Private Data" checked and also have Keep
Cookies set to "until I close Deer Park". 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load any website with cookies allowed.
2.Go to Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> View Cookies
3.Close "View Cookies" (or leave open)
4. Close FF
5. "Clear Private Data" dialogue opens; Click "Clear Private Data Now".
Actual Results:  
FF closes normally, but when it re-opens, the cookies are still there. 

The only way to eliminate them is manually using Ctrl+Shift+Del to open the
Clear Private Data Dialogue (checked to erase cookies) or using Clear Cookies Now. 

Expected Results:  
The cookies should have been erased.

When the browser is closed without my having looked at the cookies, and then
re-opened, and then closed again normally (with the Clear Private Data checked
to clear cookies and "Keep Cookies until I close Deer Park"), the cookies are
eliminated as expected.

Works for me in trunk and branch.
First deleted all cookies. Then set Cookies to "Keep Cookies - until I close
Firefox". Went to www.yahoo.com. Verified that a cookie was set.
Closed Firefox. After opening the cookie was gone.
I've discovered one more "component" to the bug: it only applies to cookies that
you have allowed as "Exceptions" to override the general ""Allow sites to set
cookies" setting.

Example:
1. The "Cookies" entry in "Clear Private Data" is checked.
2.. Allow cookies is unchecked ("Keep cookies -> until I close Deer Park" is
checked" but inactive since Allow cookies is unchecked.)
3. "signin.ebay.de" is desginated in the whitelist as an Exception under "Allow
cookies".
4.. Log in at EBay (with cookies still unchecked). Login is successful.
5. End session by closing FF.
6. Dialog "Clear Private Data" opens; "Cookies" entry is checked.
7. Click "Clear Private Data Now".
8. FF closes.

Expected behavior: When re-opening FF, EBay cookies should be gone.
Actual Behavior: When re-opening cookies, EBay cookies are still there and must
be removed manually.
