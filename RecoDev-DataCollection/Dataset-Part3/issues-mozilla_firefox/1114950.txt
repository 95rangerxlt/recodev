Almost all the options and tweaks of ColorfulTabs add-on works, but it does not confirm to the new Australis look of the browser.
The Underline of the e10s mode is white in color instead of the default black

Its goes back to box shaped tabs.

Binary Turf, are you the developer of the "ColorfulTabs" add-on? The add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Ally on this bug. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colorfultabs/
Please attach screenshot. How does it work with the non-e10s?

As I've mentioned the add-on works fine, except that it does not confirm to the australis look which Firefox has adopted. The add-on makes use of box tabs.

Also the underline is white, its black as default on e10s without the addon.
It has more to do with using the persona theme than anything to do with e10 at all.

1) When reporting bugs please make sure you report them https://www.binaryturf.com/forums because that's where I provide support.
2) I do not consider compatibility issues with third-party addons necessarily as bugs. Two addons trying to style the tabs will break something.
Binary Turf forgive my knowledge and my misunderstanding that the box tab look was related to e10s
