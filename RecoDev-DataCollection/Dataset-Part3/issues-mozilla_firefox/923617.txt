Alice, I saw 1 to 2 second load times during development, and didn't see any see any perf issues. The bigger directories are about a megabyte of HTML though, so I'm interested in getting in more details from you.
Now it is 5000+ folders/5 month.
And UI freezes while loading page(about 3-4 sec).

It is 10000+ folders/year.
I suppose that UI comes to freeze for approximately ten seconds.
Lets make this bug RelEng specific given that the underlying problem here is bug 680767 and would cause a duplicate. Would there be a way to handle that better on the new server?
Actually I noticed the same thing until I used the profiler now to analyze where we spend the most time in. So in-fact it is working fine when Ghostery has been disabled. Alice, are you using this extension or another content blocking one?
Adblock Plus+easylist maybe.
Anyway it is not affect for normal user. I think it is not so serious.

We're planning to keep 24 weeks of builds (4x 6 weeks), so the number of directories is bounded. We also have only half a cycle until we hit the peak size.

I see this too - there's a delay after the initial page rendering until you can scroll/interact with it, which goes away if you disable Ghostery. Can't reproduce with Adblock Plus though.

I will CC Felix, who is the dev for Ghostery. Would be good if we could get this fixed.
Did you hear anything back ?
No, but we could wait for a long time here if I don't actually CC Felix! :/ Sorry for that. Putting needinfo on him for feedback.
Hi all, thanks for adding me to this bug. I do see a lot of chatter that Ghostery generates on this page and I'm taking a closer look at this point.

Ghostery passes all remotely loaded elements through a matcher to determine if an element is a tracker. This includes images and this page has many images (folder icon). Ghostery should skip scanning or even selecting the images from the same domain, but this is applied inside the matcher, so on this page each image produced an emit event that added up to the biggest slow down according to profiling tool. I've fixed this and it sped up the page, but there are many other things I could do to speed up apparent loading times.  In any case, I'll release a beta today and update this ticket so you may confirm if I'm on the right track.

Thanks!
Released into the beta channel: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/versions/?page=1#version-5.0.6rc1
That is a ton better, Felix! I still get a short freeze but that seems to be Firefox specific and related to reflows. 

Thanks a lot for the quick fix! I think we should move this bug into extension compatibility.
Fixed by new Ghostery version.
