One of our providers uses the exact same URL for every flyout, and magically adjusts the content to suit whatever it is they want to show.

In effect, this means the social flyout is resized once for the initial load, but is never resized after that, meaning the panel is often an inappropriate size for the content being shown.

We can probably use mutation observers for this - https://github.com/mozilla/socialapi-dev/blob/develop/content/toolbarStatusWidget.js#L119 might be useful...

use a mutation observer to dynamically resize and tweaks to the sizing itself

Hopefully is fairly self-explanatory.  I did tweak the resizing itself as it has picked up a little cruft from the old addon we did for this that isn't necessary now.  Note that for some providers, the height of the notification panels may be too small, but AFAIK this is an issue on the provider side.

Use offsetHeight instead of scrollHeight

After chatting to Jaws on IRC, this new patch reverts to using offsetHeight instead of scrollHeight

offsetHeight won't include the marginTop or marginBottom. Can you add those in here too?

let cs = doc.defaultView.getComputedStyle(body);
let computedHeight = parseInt(cs.marginTop) + body.offsetHeight + parseInt(cs.marginBottom);
let height = computedHeight || 300;

(The "configuration of the observer" part is implied.)

Please add the following after this:
document.body.offsetWidth; // force a layout flush

Could you dispatch an event here and have browser_social_flyout.js listen for that event? This should let us remove the executeSoon call.
