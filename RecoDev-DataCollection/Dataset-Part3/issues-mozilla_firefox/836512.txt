When I clicked the button on the notification bar in Aurora 20.0a2 (2013-01-27), I get taken to the advanced pane of perefences, on the "Data Choices" tab. This tab is empty. It's devoid of any words, numbers, pictures, checkboxes, radio buttons... or anything else. This makes it very hard for me to change the settings.

Cannot reproduce on 2/4 Windows Aurora build.  The pane shows Crash Reporter and Telemetry.

Tom, if you're seeing this on current Aurora can you check for any errors in the JS console?
Should be fixed on Aurora after bug 837459 landed.
