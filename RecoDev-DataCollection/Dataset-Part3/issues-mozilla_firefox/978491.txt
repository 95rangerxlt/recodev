The new sidebars widget has no inverted icon when the subview is shown in the panel. It should for consistency.

The new sidebars widget has no inverted icon when the subview is shown in the panel. It should for consistency.
Fixed by backing out the sidebars widget ( bug 960198)
The issue is back in latest Nightlies.
The icon is missing from the spritesheet on Windows and Linux. I should have caught this when reviewing 960198 (unless they were removed by one of the other changes...) Shane?
I think it may have been caused by bug 969904.

Indeed:

Stephen, Mike? I also noticed in this (somewhat 'dumb') visual diff that the find icon was reversed. ISTR that was discussed on IRC and *wasn't* intended? Maybe I misunderstood the conversation at the time...

(note that it seems like the icon was changed to have the sidebar separator further from the right, which means we can't just put back the part of the icon that was deleted. :-( )
I didn't catch the missing inverted icon for the sidebars widget. It should be re-added!

The find button should be inverted for windows, compared with OSX, at least that's what Stephen told me. If this is wrong at the moment, then this would mean I checked in the wrong patch and that would make me super sad.

As much as I hate being the bearer of bad news:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/menuPanel.png
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/menuPanel.png

have it pointing the same direction.
Yes, it seemed like Stephen didn't update the menuPanel.png resource properly and I didn't check thoroughly enough, which I should've done.

Stephen, can you post a corrected menuPanel.png in this bug please? I can produce/ review the patch if you'd like. Thanks!

If the find icon is inverted in menu panel, it'd be nice if the toolbar icon was too (for consistency). It's not currently the case.

Yes, would be nice for the toolbar also. I don't think it currently has a toggled state attribute though.

Patch for linux

Shorlander forgot to fix the problem for linux.
Here's a patch that uses the Windows menuPanel.png asset for linux (as it always did before).
