I can confirm this on:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040119
Firebird/0.8.0+

Problem also exhibits on Linux too.

I'm not sure if this is the intended behaviour or not, though. But there is
definitely an inconsistency between how the Bookmarks sidebar and History
sidebar are handled. Thus there is a bug somewhere, as this should at least be
consistent. Clearly one of these is exhibiting the wrong behaviour.
It's fixed by blake.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
