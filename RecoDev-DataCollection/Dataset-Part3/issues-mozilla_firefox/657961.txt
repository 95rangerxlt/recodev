I got rid of the _favicon cache because getFavicon is only called once.
notice that the callback is declared with [function] so you don't have to build a object in js :)

Thanks, Marco :)

I was debating between making getFavicon just take a nsIFaviconDataCallback as its callback, but I think I like abstracting that away in the Site object. However, I don't feel too strongly either way, so I can change it if that would be better.

You should consider placing this call in a try-catch and Cu.reportError an errors that happen.

In this case, we'll always prefer the https favicon (assuming they are different).  This is likely fine.

Everywhere else that we use this with the exception of panorama, we actually set the default in CSS, and then override it with the real one if needed.  I think we should probably do the same here.

Addressed comments. To set the default favicon in CSS, I also had to put in a style rule to get rid of the favicon image for the "All Sites" item. This adds a little bit more complexity, so I want to make sure it's still what you think we should do.

This is just an implementation issue. There isn't anything visible to the user, other than better performance.
