Having a Return scope then a <return> pseudo variable just to show the returned value is awkward and looks clunky. We need a better way of addressing these situations.

Ideally, the same UI mechanism should be used for the Parameters scope, so we need a better and consistent design for both.

Maybe we should also show the function name in the VariablesView.

This is fixed in the latest iteration of bug 929349, so this can close when that patch lands.
