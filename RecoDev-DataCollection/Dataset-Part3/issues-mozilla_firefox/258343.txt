HA!
I love this one. very good catch.
patch is trivial, I'll do that today.
Comment from Quark (IRC) after your checkin:

I had the size of my searchbar expanded - #search-container {-moz-box-flex: 200
!important;} - and pch's checkins broke it, the inner text box doesn't expand
with the search-container.

If it's related ?

Just a note, this affects any place in the context menu that's not selectable,
so you can get this around the entire border.

I am sorry for the inconveniences, I'll post tomorrow in the mz forum to ease
the conversion.
-> fixed.
