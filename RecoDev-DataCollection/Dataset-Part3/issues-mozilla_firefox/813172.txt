that's probably accurate, isn't it? Since we're evaling inside the scope of that function, arguments is likely just an empty array. Not sure we need to special-case this or not.

Well, what we're doing is a hack (avoid multiple client evaluation requests), and we shouldn't expose this fact. Neither Chrome nor Firebug has this behavior.

alrighty then. Maybe this is worthy of a comment around the arguments argument and the regex to help future generations.
