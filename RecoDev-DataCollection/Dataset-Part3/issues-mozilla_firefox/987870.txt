Type "color:" into a new rule property
A dropdown opens with a suggested list of colors
Press 'down'

Expected that pressing arrow keys moves around the list.  Won't move around the list until you start typing a character and one of the results becomes selected.

Not converting to metaKey in synthesizeKey as there it wants accelKey to simulate cmd.

Found another weird bug here (with and without patch applied).  If I type "color:" and the list opens up then select one of them with my mouse the property disappears nothing gets applied.
That is a regression from a long time back when some output parser refactoring was done. I don;t know if I have a bug on file though.

Comparing with Nightly, I think Bug 912189 has aggravated this problem.  In nightly, after selecting one with the mouse it picks it but the popup sticks around - and if you do it a couple of times some weird stuff happens.  Now if you pick with the mouse then everything disappears and the property is deleted.

We need to either fix this problem here or make sure that a bug is filed that will land along with 912189 to fix this one.

This bug already clubs 2 separate issues. Followup is the right way imo.

Fine with me - I've filed Bug 988001
Let's wait for try to return before checking in to make sure our meta/accel keys are working across all platforms
green enough. (random unrelated oranges)
