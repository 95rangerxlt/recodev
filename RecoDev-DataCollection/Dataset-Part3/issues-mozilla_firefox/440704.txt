Hello,
When I install Firefox 3 RTM on Windows XP or Vista using the /INI=path\config.ini
for a silent unattended installation, there's no way to avoid Firefox 3 to be setup as the default browser.
It's not the same question as the bug # 433249.
I want to deploy firefox silently using an unattended answer file (config.ini) and set there an option like "SetAsDefaultAppUser=False" and "SetAsDefaultAppGlobal=False"
Thx for modifying the NSI installer according to my request and needs :-)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. setup.exe /INI=path\config.ini

Actual Results:  
Firefox is set as the default browser

Expected Results:  
Firefox should not be set as the default browser

My corporate default profile for Firefox already turns off the user prompt asking if firefox should be the default browser.

Currently my workaround is to execute:
"%systemroot%\system32\ie4uinit.exe" -reinstall
So that IE is set back as the default browser in my corporate environment.

Ted, could you review this? I'd prefer not to bother Benjamin with this simple patch.

To set those you can use the following
"<path to install dir>\uninstall\helper.exe" /SetAsDefaultAppGlobal
note: must be called with the permissions to set as the system default browser

"<path to install dir>\Mozilla Firefox\uninstall\helper.exe" /SetAsDefaultAppUser
note: must be called as the user that you want to set Firefox as the default browser

Drivers, this patch checks if the installer is running silently and skips the setting as the default browser for the user. See comment #2 for additional info
