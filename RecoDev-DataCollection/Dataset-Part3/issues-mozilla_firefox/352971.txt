We should remove the width and height attributes altogether so we can replace the images in the future, even post-release, without having to use the exact same dimensions.
(For instance, I regard the searchbar image as pretty large.)

The document will shift slightly when the images are loaded, but only the first time since the images are cached. This is different from Help in Firefox 1.0, where the documents would've jumped heavily because of the screenshots of the options dialogs and extensions/theme manager.
Must-fix for Firefox 2. Patch is simple, just remove the width and height attributes.

... and affects each and every locale at the same size. Wouldn't it be easier to redo the screenshots to have the old size? Maybe just pad them with transparency.

If you change size of online images this will affect at least italian locale: since we were so close to the cvs freeze, I saw the first patch proposed and changed using_firebird.xhtml with updated sizes.


Other locales are not affected unless they take the change from bug 346888 from 4 days ago, which changed the base URI of the help images. And if they take that, they should take this change as well.

Here are searches for the old dimensions:

Francesco, this is getting relly difficult to fix if some (almost all) locales hardcode the old size and others (yours) the new size...

I know... Unfortunately this is an inevitable consequence of the short time (4 days) left to localizers to make such big updates on the documentation (also en-US documentation is not perfect, see bug 352968 still marked as NEW).

Even this is not the right place, I think it's time to make some serious reflections about moving help out of the build process (I've already made my suggestions in a discussion on mozilla.dev.l10n).
