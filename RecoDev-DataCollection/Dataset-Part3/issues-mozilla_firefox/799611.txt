Review of attachment 670106:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

r+ but the links all lead to the same page with the same layout, and the Nightly link doesn't even have a Nightly download button.
I assume this will be fixed after or around when this lands?

That is the plan per bug 794109 comment #36.
It would be good for the query string reading to be done before the new stub is out there, but it's not a big deal.
Even without it we still want it to open a web page asap instead of trying to download the full installer directly for several reasons.
