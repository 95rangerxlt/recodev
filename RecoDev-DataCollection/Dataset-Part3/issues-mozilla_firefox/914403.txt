Part 1: Fix explicit selection removal with remote highlighter

This cleans up a flawed part of the basic highlighter test.  The call to selection.setNode(null) would fail because walker.highlight would blow up when passing null to _installHelperSheet.

Part 2: Convert basic highlighter test to Task.jsm

I've converted this test to use Task.jsm.  It makes it generally easier to read and simpler to extend in part 3.

Part 3: Clear selection on remote inspector destuction

This fixes the main issue mentioned in comment #0.  The highlighter would correctly disappear after it timed out, but if you closed the toolbox before the timeout fired, the highlighter would remain forever.

This forces the selection to be cleared on inspector destruction.
