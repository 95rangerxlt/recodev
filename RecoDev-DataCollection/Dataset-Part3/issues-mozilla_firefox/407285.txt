code cleanup:  remove type=0 from place:type=0 and queryType=0 from place:queryType=0 as those are the defaults

I had a patch for bug #399266 that did this, but dietrich wisely asked for a minimal patch, and asked me to spin out these changes.

doing this in bug 428690
fixed with bug 428690
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
