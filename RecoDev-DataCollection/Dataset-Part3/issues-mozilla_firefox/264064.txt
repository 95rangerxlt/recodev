This fixes the lose of the security indicators when customizing toolbar on a
secure site.  The reason the indicators are lost is because the init function
of the statushandler is called when the toolbar changes.  My fix changes the
init function to try and get the security information off the securityui if
available.

Fix v 1.0

the if/else statement is unnecessary here, securityUI should already be inited
in the browser constructor, and is expected to not fail.  We assume so already
elsewhere.  See bug 180962

I'll r+ a patch that just has the required two lines changed.
