On my Windows 2000, the following three registry values for IE6 SP2 are DWORD rather than REG_SZ, but they're treated as REG_SZ in IE migrator. 

Can someone else confirm that their IE6 have the same value types for them as mine?

"Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Settings" : Always use my color, Always use my font face


"Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main" : SmoothScroll

On WinXP/IE7 they are all DWORD, as is 'Always Use My Font Size'.
fixed by the new migrator
