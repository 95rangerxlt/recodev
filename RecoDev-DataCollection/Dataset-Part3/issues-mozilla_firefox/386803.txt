Does this happen for you even at http://xkcd.com/c252.html?  (Hover over the comic for a tooltip.)

Hello
I did as you told me and hovered over the comic, but it is the same.
But I managed to find the cause. Its the theme I use. This theme makes the tooltips' background black and the font white. Firefox simply uses the same font color in tooltips as windows, but it always uses its own background color which is white, that's why the tooltips appeared as white boxes.
I changed the font color of the tooltips in the display properties, and the tooltips started to appear normally.
But this means that I must not use the tooltips' colors of my theme.
May be you have a another solution.
I've been using Firefox for a long time now, and it has been updated several times, but till now this littel bug contiues to exist.
Is it so difficult to make the color of the font in tooltips always black ?

Thank you
This bug was fixed in Firefox 3. Tooltip background-color now adheres to the system settings.
