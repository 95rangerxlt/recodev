dveditz was seeing an exception in NewTabUtils.extractSite:

Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIURI.asciiHost]  from NewTabUtils::extractSite

nsIURI.asciiHost throws NS_ERROR_FAILURE for nsJARURI and nsMozIconURI, and indeed he had some jar URIs in his PlacesProvider's top sites.

No need for the extra uri and host variables anymore. We can just put the return newURI.asciiHost.replace directly in the try and catch return null because both try/catch blocks just return null. I suppose technically yes, .replace shouldn't throw and could be left outside of the try -- in this case, just a "let host" and one try block still.
