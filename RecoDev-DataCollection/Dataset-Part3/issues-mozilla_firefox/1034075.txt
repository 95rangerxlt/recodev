It is useful for debugging to know whether at least one write has been completed. We should add this to the state of the SessionFile AsyncShutdown blocker.

Sorry for the delay in review, I was mistakenly assuming some of the feedback
from when you were trying to uplift this stuff would apply here. My bad!

This looks fine to me.

Just an aside though, I was reading inside AsyncShutdown.jsm when reviewing
this patched and noticed there is mixed indentation with tabs and spaces[1].
I haven't checked this patch to make sure it's only using space characters
for indentation, so you should probably check that your editor is configured
correctly.

This seems like a strange, roundabout way to accomplish this. Is it really the only way to report and cause a test failure?

Ah, thanks.

I can think of several variants, but they all revolve around using `Promise.reject(someException)`. Now, instead of `Object.create`, I could create a new error, copy the stack & co and add a new error message.

Sorry about that, I uploaded an incomplete patch.
