I customized Australis, and got this: http://screencast.com/t/djdt5kLPu36p

The forward button keeps taking up space even when it should be gone. It's hidden and becomes visible on hover.

I didn't see this at first, so it's definitely something about the customization process. I'll try to reproduce with a fresh profile in a minute.

Gijs says that this is not the same as bug 700363.
