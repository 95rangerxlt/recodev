When opting in to tracking protection, a user should be able to choose a blocklist provider, when there are multiple options.

People opt into tracking protection in Preferences, so this choice should probably be made there.

Expanding the scope of this bug to include the general design of the switch. The point value can stay the same.

Wireframe attached.
This has been discussed with Chad and Madhava.
The strings are still subject to some debate, but the structure stands.

Styling-wise, we can use the controls we currently have in In-Content-Preferences.

I updated the mockup based on feedback from mmc and mconnor:

1. Added ability to remove sites from the personal whitelist

2. Removed the functionality to add custom blocklists. These lists are way more complicated and require in-depth knowledge to manage effectively. Therefore it doesn't make sense to expose anything beyond disabling/enabling lists in the UI.
