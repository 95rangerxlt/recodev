Ehsan, I looked through mxr and didn't find an existing test for this. Please let me know if there is one and I just didn't find it. Thanks!

I don't think we have a test for this, but let's give Josh a chance to prove me wrong!
Sorry, :jdm, not :jsm!
I found nothing.
To note: about:cache will be broken after the new cache code will land on m-c.  There will be apis to walk private browsing cache content, it will probably be better to use in tests.  Those apis are planned to be used for any newer generations of about:cache anyway.  See [1], [2] and [3] for more info.

Create a browser chrome test that checks about:cache after private browsing

The test passes on Mac OSX, but has one fail on Ubuntu, when checking the number of entries under Memory cache, in the private window.

I don't know what could be the problem on Ubuntu. Ehsan, could you please help me with some feedback? Thanks in advance!

You need to use clearUserPref when your test is done to make sure that you're not affecting tests run after this one.

Use example.com.  Our tests are not supposed to access external resources.

What does the test failure here look like?
Sorry for this late reply, but I was on PTO. Thanks for the prompt review! :)

I used "example.iana.org" because I observed that both when running the automated test and performing it manually, after typing "example.com" in the adress bar, it redirects me to "example.iana.org". Also, when manually checking the number of entries under Memory cache, in "about:cache" from the private window, I get these 3 entries:

http://example.iana.org/

http://example.iana.org/favicon.ico

http://example.com/


I assume I only need to take into account "http://example.com/", so I'm checking to see if there is this particularly one entry, right?

This is the fail that I get on Ubuntu (when testing with both "example.iana.org" and "example.com"): Memory cache reports some entries from example.com domain - Got -1, expected 1

Sorry, I should have said example.org.  example.org is redirected to a local web server which runs the mochitests.

If you open about:cache after the test has run, do you see a memory cache entry for this site?

Yes

second version of the test

The test passes both on Ubuntu and Mac machines.
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/269b7a2b7310

Please make sure that future patches have a commit message that summarizes what the patch is doing before requesting checkin.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/269b7a2b7310
Note: this will break after new cache backend lands.
Better note: this *might* break after new cache lands.  However, we will turn all test to green before it should go to the tree.  However, one of ways to make the tree green is to disable this test.  We will see, maybe I just speak to soon ;)
