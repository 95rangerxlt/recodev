I'm splitting this out from Bug 520837 since the 2 codes are separate and caused regressions at different times.

looks like Jumplists don't check for wintaskbar availability before trying to Cu.import the module, Aeropeek does that. So we import the module just to discover we are not on Seven and bail out.

There could be other reasons for the regression though.

11.43% on XP, 8.12% on Vista
hm, jumplists did not land on 3.6 from what i can see. clearing blocking req.
I'd rather not have a Ts regression on 7 either, so maybe there is a way to delay the load of all this since it's not central to startup of the browser.
well sure, but at the same time why losing time on other OSes, even if we remove this from Ts it is still useless work. Aeropeek and future downloads progress are doing that, so i think jumplists can do the same (and maybe use the same WIN7_FEATURES define that is added there for that purpose)
Just pushed a fix for a bug where the jsm wasn't being imported due to a bad filename. It'll be interesting to see how that effects this.

win7 trap for import and delayed update v.1
Created attachment 405099
sysinfo trap for import and delayed update v.1
I've pushed both of these to try to see what effects they have. Using available might be slower since you have to initialize the taskbar object to get the result.
Went away after the bad import path patch (bug 518666) landed.

See bug 521104 for details on various issues related to bad import paths.
out of curiosity, did one of the two patches above show any improvement on tryservers? i'd expect them to bring an improvement on XP, since there the module is completely useless but it is still imported.
nevermind i've seen the patch in bug 518666. even if all of these patches are related it's hard to notice patches on an already fixed bug :)
