This means its harder to have a third branding directory without code changes, which sucks.  I want to add a third branding (Gran Paradiso) to trunk for alphas, while leaving the nightlies as Minefield.

r=me, but as a caveat, this breaks if you have a space, even when quoted.  That's outside of the scope of this bug.

As a note, I landed browser/branding/unofficial with the right files to take advantage of this, if someone wishes to test the patch
Fixed on trunk.
Is there any chance to checkin this patch onto 1.8 branch?

I mean only the configure.in hack to make %branding_dir%/configure.sh
backwards/forwards compatible ?

+REAL_BRANDING_DIRECTORY="${MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY}"
+
+if test -e "$topsrcdir/$REAL_BRANDING_DIRECTORY/configure.sh"; then
+  . "$topsrcdir/$REAL_BRANDING_DIRECTORY/configure.sh"
+fi
