We'd like to get the Firefox language packs on AMO for the FF2 cycle. In order for  this to happen, we at some point need to bump the maxVersion setting in the langpack install.rdf to 2.0.0.*. This should only happen right before the release cycle.

And we should probably add this to some release-team checklist or 'nother.
We're less than three days from the RC freeze, and we haven't taken any l10n changes since beta 2, so we should be good to go here whenever you have a patch.
Re the no l10n changes, we still have bug 350422 coming up, removing of one entity. Though that wouldn't break an langpack, as that is just leaving unused stuff in there.

r+ on the browser part, r- on the mail part. Thunderbird isn't string frozen yet.
The browser part shouldn't land before we resolved the help links between pref window and help content in bug 341899. Hopefully that's the only one of that kind.

a=schrep for drivers
Fixed on MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH. I'll file a separate bug to track the tbird langpacks.
