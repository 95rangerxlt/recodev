This is a follow-up to bug 1066447. I fixed more callers and added an isContentWindowPrivate variant for content scripts.

It would be nice if we could throw in isWindowPrivate if the argument is not a chrome window, but I'm not confident enough to do that yet. Let's let the warning sit for a while first.

There's a whole load of mobile/ changes as well, let's ask a mobile peer for review too.

Can we mention that isContentWindowPrivate() should only be used by frame scripts?

Thanks for the heads up, Tim. The /mobile changes look good to me.

Added dev-doc-needed because this introduced PrivateBrowsingUtils.isContentWindowPrivate() and deprecated PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate() for content windows - yet the documentation (meaning only https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Supporting_per-window_private_browsing from what I can see) is unaware of that.
