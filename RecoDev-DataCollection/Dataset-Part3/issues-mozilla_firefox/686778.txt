Patch for bug

Bug 684561 moved the close button to the right on Windows but accidentally moved the close button to the right on Mac as well. Also some toolbarbutton margins that were increased on winstripe are also needed on gnomestripe.

Here's what the buttons look like for me on Linux without this patch. This looks ok to me, I don't think more space around them is needed.

Patch for bug 686778 v2

Removed the style changes for gnomestripe since it wasn't too terrible looking on gnomestripe pre-patch.

HUDService.jsm was r+ from dcamp whereas webconsole.css review was forwarded to dao. Therefore, I'll carry forward r+ from dcamp.
