As part of Ben's checkin from 2004-06-22 17:16, which was about "remove some
old, unneeded files", he also made this change to tabbox.xml:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsview2.cgi?diff_mode=context&whitespace_mode=show&subdir=mozilla/toolkit/content/widgets&command=DIFF_FRAMESET&file=tabbox.xml&rev1=1.10&rev2=1.10.14.1&root=/cvsroot

You can now change tabs by pressing not only Ctrl+PgUp/Down, but also by
Ctrl-Left/Up and Ctrl/Right/Down.
This breaks the jumping to the previous/next word in textboxes by pressing
Ctrl-Left/Right. This is highly confusing. I keep switching tabs all the time.

We didn't use Ctrl-Up/Down before AFAIK, so we can keep that.

patch (backout of changes to Ctrl-Left/Right)

This reverts the changes to Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right.
Ctrl-Up/Down still switches tabs, in addition to the Ctrl+PgUp/PgDown we always
had.
Note that this only affects branch builds. Considering the checkin date,
official builds starting today will be affected by this.

I've spoken to Ben about this over AIM, and he's about to back it out.
Fixed - backed out accidental checkin.

This is obsolete then.
