Menus are disabled after Customize Toolbars until browser is restarted. This
problem appears to occur on Linux only.

Steps to Repro:
1a. View | Toolbars | Customize
-or-
1b. Right-click on a toolbar, Customize.
2. Do something (or nothing).
3. Press Done.

Expected Results:
Menus should work okay.

Actual Results:
Menus are disabled until browser is restarted.

I have a feeling this *may* have the same root cause as bug 243210, but I'm not
sure on that. Regression window appears to be similar. Today's builds do not
work, yet builds from 2004-05-08 do not have problems.

I'm also having the same problem.
Reproduced with the same steps.

This does not happen with build 20040509 on Win2k.
Confirmed on Linux. I was forced to return to a 20040507 build, which is NOT
broken. The build ID of the broken build is:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040510 Firefox/0.8.0+
(daihard: XFT+GTK2; opt. for P4/SSE-2)

One bug that may be related to this is bug 243210, which also appeared in the
build enumerated above.
Confirming this aswell, Linux.

http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=76261 says this is fixed.  Is that
true?
My build of Wed May 12 18:59:54 CDT 2004 has this fixed.
