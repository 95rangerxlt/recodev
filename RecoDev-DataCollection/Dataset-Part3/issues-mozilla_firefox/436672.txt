Polycom PVX is a desktop H.323 videoconferencing client.  If it is closed while any Firefox 3 (Beta 5 or RC1--doesn't seem to matter) window is open, the computer restarts approximately 3-5 seconds later.  No core dump, just straight to the BIOS for reboot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox 3b5 or RC1 window.
2. Start Polycom PVX.
3. Close Polycom PVX.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SAVED ALL YOUR WORK.
Actual Results:  
Complete system restart.

Expected Results:  
Exited normally--closing a program shouldn't crash the machine.

This bug occurs with the default theme and no unusual plugins installed.

I can be contacted if anyone requires a trial copy of the software--it will be sufficient for testing purposes.  Cheers, -P
As of Release Candidate 2, this issue seems to be resolved.  I will update further if it reappears.  -PW
