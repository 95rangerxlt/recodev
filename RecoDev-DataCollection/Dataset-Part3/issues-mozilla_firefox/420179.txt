This doesn't actually affect the build, so I'm just going to land it.
mozilla/browser/locales/all-locales 	1.31 
What was this good for? sr is now both on incubator and on trunk, which is rather confusing.
I think I filed this because I noticed that the tinderbox had been set up. I thought that implied that it should be in all-locales so that tinderbox would actually build it. I didn't realize that you intentionally keep locales that could be building out of all-locales.
