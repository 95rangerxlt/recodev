Bug 1134550 will create a tiles v3 endpoint. This will require a change in Firefox to point to the new endpoint and to read/handle the new format:

{ "related": [{"title": "tile", "type": "affiliate"},
  "directory": [{...},...] }

oyiptong has a good point that Firefox 38 assumes the content is all affiliate suggested tiles, but for Firefox 39 we'll want to serve sponsored suggested tiles -- probably using the same v3 endpoint. This means for Firefox 38, we'll want to explicitly only allow type=affiliate to avoid accidentally showing sponsored tiles without the correct messaging.

In the process of updating tests for bug 1140496, I ran into an exception here because I didn't include frecent_sites in the tile object. We should probably skip over invalid entries. We had a previous bug where we expected an array as the value of "en-US" key, but when the server accidentally served { en-US: { en-US: [..] } }, it completely broke new tab pages for Firefox users.

Although I believe an exception in the insides of getLinks will trigger the failure path of the promise resulting in reportError and returning [].
