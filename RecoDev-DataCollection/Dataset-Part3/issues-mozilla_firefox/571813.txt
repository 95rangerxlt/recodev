Alongside the other Aero bug we've been having with full screen mode, the introduction of the Firefox Button to nightly builds has also caused an issue, causing it to still appear if the toolbar is set to auto-hide.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go into full screen mode on the default theme.
2. Set the toolbar to auto-hide
Actual Results:  
The Firefox Button remains visible on the handle for retracting the auto-hidden toolbar.

Expected Results:  
The button should either not be there, or be docked on the same line as the tabs in full screen mode.

Oh, and also because of this, the hot spot for the reactivation of the toolbar ends up being the line below the strip with the button on it.
This is fixed with most recent hourly, please dupe against bug 575994 since that fixed it.
Scratch that, its still not fixed, but now you cannot use autohide now that bug 575994 is there.

--> Bug 575449.
The button should only be hidden when the toolbar is hidden, but shown when the toolbar is not hidden, so that one can still access the appmenu when the toolbar is not hidden. In short, only hide the button when the toolbar is collapsed/hidden.
This is about full screenmode not maximized or normal mode.  Its not suppose to show at all. -  we didn't show the menubar in fullscreen mode before either.
