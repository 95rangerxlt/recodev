When I visits some of my often visited websites I sometimes, after typing a few
of the letters, click on the correct link in the autocomplete dropdown. However,
as I have visited these sites alot of times, I am very used to typing the url,
and sometimes I am actually still typing while clicking on the correct link in
the autocomplete dropdown. When that happens it looks for an website with the
letters I have already typed. Fx if I want to visit the mozilla.org website and
click the autocomplete link while having typed only 'moz' it starts searching
for 'moz' domains

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type the first letter of a site in the autocomplete list in the location bar
2. Move the mouse to the correct entry in the autocomplete list. Don't click it yet.
3. Enter some more letters of the domain quickly while clicking on the correct
entry.

Actual Results:  
The browser started searching for an domain with the letters I have already
typed myself.

Expected Results:  
The browser should have just launched the website that I clicked.

I can see the bug.
Actually, you don't have to act quickly in step 3. Just don't move the mouse
while typing an extra letter and then click is enough.
I see this also happening for input form elements (but with different results,
you just get returned the typed text).
It seems like -until you move the mouse- the new content (from the url history)
of the autocomplete popup is not 'seen' by the browser.
I see this also with

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

My example:
1. Type "moz" in bar.  You should see some mozilla site appear first in the
dropdown.  
2. Move the mouse over the first line in the dropdown so it is highlighted.
3. Type "ill".  The highlight in the dropdown list will disappear.
4. Click the left mouse button.  FF will start a domain search for "mozill", as
if you had hit Enter, instead of using the entry from the dropdown.

If I try this with a regular input widget (say, the Search box on
www.mozilla.org) then the autocomplete dropdown disappears when I type more
letters on the keyboard.  So, I can't yet reproduce this with a regular input
widget.  However, I suspect it's a general widget issue and not specific to the
location bar.

I can certainly confirm on Gecko/20040913 on my Win98 and WinXP systems. 
Because I tend to have my mouse under the Location Bar as a habit, I get it a
lot and it's quite an annoyance.

Also, this may be duplicate of bug 168623, but that bug seems to be assigned to
a Joe Hewitt who is apparently, "gone".
dumping this in firefox since that was the origially reported product.
