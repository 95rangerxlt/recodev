The notes for localizers in places.properties from bug 406355 are unfortunately not of much help, another wording should be used.

The notes for localizers in places.properties from bug 406355 are unfortunately not of much help, another wording should be used.
Perhaps something like: "Used to describe the location bar autocomplete icons for users with screen readers"? Is that clearer, Abdulkadir?
Although perhaps that's not entirely accurate, since the descriptions might not necessarily map to icons in the popup. Seth might be able to come up with something better.
Would definitely be better, it's not so important that the description is 100% accurate, in this case it would be enough to just know, whether the labels are used as nouns or verbs.

based on the above feedback, I'd probably do "Noun used to describe..."

Btw, tentatively asking feedback to Kadir
So, maybe "Noun used to describe the location bar autocomplete result type to users with screen readers"

why did Autocomplete become uppercase? maybe it's just your text editor's fault, please fix it.

I'd probably break after type, but that's not that much important.

yes, you did it!
autoland currently only works on try, is that your purpose?
Yes, but it doesn't actually seem to be working. I realize that TRYing a comment change is trivial, but I was testing out the functionality for future.

(I really need to pursue my L1 access).
