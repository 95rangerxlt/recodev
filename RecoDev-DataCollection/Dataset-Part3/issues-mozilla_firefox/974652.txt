Personally, my add-on(s) seem to be triggering that message very often when disabled, but all the widgets they insert are removed correctly (and it doesn't trigger it on every widget, in fact it's quite random the amount/frequency with which that message appears).

I can't figure out what widget/action is causing that message exactly, not even by keeping track of every on* event that CUI dispatches (weird, right?!). The ID of the widget in that message would go a long way.

Also perhaps the aArea parameter passed as well? Something like "Widget aWidgetId not found, unable to remove from aArea".
This should just add the relevant strings into the message in the code linked in comment #0.

I think this should do it.

Thanks, looks good!
