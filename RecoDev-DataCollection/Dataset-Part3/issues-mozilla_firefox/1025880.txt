There are various rules for highlighting elements in the page:
- when nodes are hovered in the markup-view
- when nodes are selected from the page, or by clicking on the breadcrumbs widget
But as of now, the default selection when the inspector opens or when the page is reloaded gets highlighted too, which isn't wanted. It gets in the way more than anything else.
And if you haven't selected any node yet and you just open the inspector from the menu, then  <body> is going to be the default selected node and therefore the whole page will be highlighted for a second, which is a bit weird.

The try build showed that my simple one-line change broke 2 highlighter tests which were relying on the fact that the highlighter would be shown when the inspector started.
This isn't the case anymore with this fix.
So I took this opportunity to rewrite those 2 tests in a consistent way.
Mike, I think this therefore requires another round of review.

Here's a new try build: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=31968f2b19c6

Nice!

I was in the middle of reformatting those two tests myself... r+ assuming a green try.
