I refer to using_firebird.xhtml (the date at the end of the page is 12 july
2004).

In Navigating Web Pages->Retracing your steps, there's a reference to a missing
image, between point 2 and 3:
http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/firefox-toolbar.jpg

In "Searching within a page" there's a description of the toolbar definitely
different from the one I can see in the 20040729 nightly.

At last, at the end of the page, there's a reference to "Contributors to the
Firebird Help Project."

Not on this end, but I'm using an older build. I'll download a recent nightly
and see if I can reproduce.

That is correct. It's copyrighted to the contributors of the Firebird Help
project. You could debate that this project was absorbed into Help Systems, but
that's something we'll do later.

Looks the same here. Could be that the help documentation wasn't updated yet in
your nightly build. Try installing a new one.

Resolving bug, since all other issues are fixed. If I'm wrong, reopen.
