This is needed to synchronize the profiler data time range with the framerate recording range, since any given profile only contains a fixed specified amount of most recent samples (which is pretty large, but enough to overflow after a few mintues), while the framerate actor just keeps on going without scraping off old data.

nit: this comment line should perhaps be moved just before 'this._ticks=null;'

Should this test also be checking that using stopRecording() with no params returns the expected default values?
(or perhaps test_framerate_01/02.html already do that)

test_framerate_02 does that already.
