STR:
1. Open page from URL field.
2. Add live bookmark.
3. Once the feed has loaded, notice that there's no 'Open "Bug List"' item at the bottom of the menu popup.

(A one-item feed saying "This feed is dead, you should have changed the URL" is a more common way of seeing it, but I can't find one offhand.)

Fix v.1
+      if (numNodes >= 2 || addHomePage) {
+        if (numNodes >= 2) {

It'd be more legible and robust to define a boolean (say, "hasMultipleFeedEntries") rather than repeating the numNodes conditional in multiple places.

Fix v.1.1

I'm in favor of legible (though not FeedEntries, since this is feeds-or-bookmarks, for Open in Tabs), and also of requesting review from an account that doesn't talk about a vacation last December in the realname.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
