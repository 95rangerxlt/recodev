At the page http://www.nature.com/index.html, pop up windows appear each time I
visit the site.  But other sites with pop windows are regularly blocked.  I have
turned on the pop up blocker function under Options/Web Features/ menu, and I
have no allowed sites.  The pop up windows at this site are blocked with
Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to http://www.nature.com/index.html
2.  Pop up ads should appear automatically, even with pop up blocker function
turned on.
3.

Actual Results:  
Pop up ads appear

Expected Results:  
Prevent pop up ads from appearing

WFM, using this build. I also turned off the blocker but nothing popped up.
Tried in I.E also and it was ok.
The problem does not occur with Firefox 1.5 beta.
