Steps to reproduce:

I can't do anything. I am reporting the Bug to you.


Actual results:

Expected results:

What should happen is, FF should keep my settings after I close it. Getting real old. about to switch browsers. Version 33.0

Reporter, have you tried that?  Maybe a file is corrupted in your profile.
A supposed copy of your profile will be made on the desktop, but you can make your own backup manually instead.
Reporter seems to be gone
