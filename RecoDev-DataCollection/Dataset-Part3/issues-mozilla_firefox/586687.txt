I realized that switching to full screen mode with cmd + shift + F when running Flash content, such as surfing on youtube, you experience a crash of the player.
The thing does not occur by setting the mode through the graphical interface, and then from the context menu at the top.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a tab
2. visit youtube.com and play a video
3. go to the full screen mode with the shortcut
Actual Results:  
flash player crashes


no special configuration, I use this only for beta testing. Add-ons are installed only the dictionary, flagfox and firefox Sync. That's all.
