The current return value appears to be unused and returning a window is non-trivial in the in-content case, so we should instead remove it. The test in bug 722978 should use observers or something.

How would using observers get us to the right window object?

Via the subject argument, or the test would just look for the window itself using window watcher and tabbrowser APIs.
@Dao, @Ehsan, will this bug block bug 722978 ?

BTW, I think I can work on this :)

No, I morphed it. This bug is now about making openPreferences never return a window.

Hmm, I think so, yes, since now you cannot use the openPreferences() function in a straightforward manner there.
