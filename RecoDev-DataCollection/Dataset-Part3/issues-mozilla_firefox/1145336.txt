This is a completely untested patch. I'm curious if this is at all the right approach (by putting this in GMPService), or if we need to tackle this differently. Chris or Anthony, can one of you answer this question, or is there someone else familiar with GMPService?
I'll let cpearce answer this.
Looks about right. :jwwang can review the GMPService changes.

:jwwang, would you be able to give me feedback on this approach? Do the changes to GMPService seem acceptable to you? I don't expect a full review just yet, I'm merely looking for initial feedback whether or not I should pursue this potential solution. Thank you!
FYI: I finally got around to testing this patch and it as far as I can tell, it works exactly as advertised. The old GMP is correctly removed from disk during an update.

(mPath, mOperation == REMOVE_AND_DELETE_FROM_DISK)

I am fine with the naming. But it occurs to me there is apt-get on Linux which has a "purge" command.

Btw, I think we also need to call AbortAsyncShutdown() to ensure the plugin is closed/shutdown immediately.

Thank you for the helpful feedback! I'm setting this back to r? to have you look over one additional change that I made to the patch (see details below).

I believe you're right, but now that I'm reading this again I also believe that we need to call CloseActive(false) when we're removing the files from disk. Do my changes in this patch seem correct to you?

Thanks again for your help!

This simply adds a removeAndDeletePluginDirectory method to our MockGMPService in our tests to avoid JS errors saying that it isn't a function.

|aDeleteFromDisk == true| should do all things that |aDeleteFromDisk == false| would do in addition to |pluginpath->Remove(true)|, right?

Combined patch for aurora

Note: this patch requires the combined aurora patch for bug 1140263 to be applied first!

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Adobe EME
[User impact if declined]: When GMPs are updated, we would not delete the old files and leave them on disk.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: We have mochitest and xpcshell regression tests. Local testing confirms that old GMPs are properly removed from disk during updates.
[Risks and why]: minimal
[String/UUID change made/needed]: The UUID for mozIGeckoMediaPluginService had to be updated due to the addition of the new |removeAndDeletePluginDirectory| method.
