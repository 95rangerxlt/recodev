Can't reproduce this on current OS X builds. Can you try this build? I suspect Jared's fix for undo close tab fixed this: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/ux-macosx64/1369751904/firefox-24.0a1.en-US.mac.dmg

Egh, scratch that, I can reproduce weirdness, at the very least.

I had this in my patch for the "undo close tab" bug but the patch worked fine without it. It seems that the change was necessary after all :)

Oh yeah, totally. How did that stuff get down there after the beforecustomization event fires? :/

I have a sneaking suspicion that was my bad. r=me.
