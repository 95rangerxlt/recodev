Steps to reproduce:

2. Right click on a tab and choose Undo Close Tab.

Results:
Tab clicked on remains focused with dotted outline showing.

Expected results:
Newly-opened tab's content area needs to be focused.

This is an addition to the main undo-close-tab feature. Shouldn't block bug 342179, which is unrelated AFAICT.
Re: bug 343803 comment #4, the fix for this bug should also address which tab gets focus when re-opening multiple closed tabs via the history menu.
I'm guessing that Dietrich meant to take this when he marked it as assigned... :)
Adam: can you still reproduce this issue?
Yep. I can reproduce on current trunk and branch. 

This only happens if you use Undo Close Tab from the tab context menu; the page is focused correctly if you open the tab from the History > Recently Closed Tabs menu.
Right, this still happens if you right-click on the _current_ tab (which gets the focus with the click and won't let it go).

I'm not sure whether the correct solution should rather be to just move the focus rectangle to the reopened tab though. Or maybe - for accessibility reasons - we're not supposed to move the focus at all.

Aaron: what would the correct behavior be in this case?
The right thing to do would be to focus the new tab's contents.

I can't do superreviews and anyway you don't need them for chrome. You need a toolkit/browser peer to review this (and I'm not one, I don't think dietrich is either). Try bugs.mano or someone listed on mozilla.org.

I know, I know. OTOH you're the accessibility guru and I'd like to know whether the solution chosen is acceptable from your point of view (and "superreview" is the closest to an "access-review" flag we have).
