Isn't this fixed now that I partially backed out the patch from bug 330705?

This fixes it, but I'm not really sure why.
Apparently, the adding of a functional blur method for xul elements, which I did in bug 330705, has caused this bug.
additional:

if you quickly rightarrow, you can get to other tabs.
So the focus is properly applied, but lost due to one or another timeout.

Perhaps due to http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/toolkit/content/widgets/tabbrowser.xml&rev=1.216#669 ? </random guess>
Or perhaps the delayed setFocus stuff further down in updateCurrentBrowser.

Yes, thanks!
That is the cause of the bug. When the tab is the focusedElement, it gets blurred now. The extra check I added prevents that. I copied it more or less from below, where a similar check is used.

This should be very safe, but I wonder why this blur() line is even there. Maybe because of Mac problems showing the outline through the background tab or something?

It seems to have been added by attachment 152579 from bug 175893, by Aaron. Maybe he remembers what it's for?
Also affects SeaMonkey tabbrowser btw.
Filed Bug 364969 for xpfe/.

Oops, sorry, the patch should use document.commandDispatcher.focusedElement
instead of this.mCurrentBrowser.focusedElement.

Ok, this patch is for xpfe and toolkit. I haven't tested the xpfe version (my seamonkey build not working right now).
I had an irc chat with Aaron on this. Basically he agreed that we should try to remove this code, but he suggested to me that I should file a new bug on that, and put the accompanying patch for the removal in there.

It's not obvious so I won't ask you to alter the patch but mCurrentTab hasn't been changed yet so that we don't technically need to check parent nodes here.

Maybe add a comment explaining the check? ("Only blur the focused element if it isn't another tab, to avoid breaking keyboard tab navigation"?)
Er, s/another/a/, I guess.

I filed bug 367806 on actually removing this code again.
