Created attachment 224345
add the setTabTitleLoading bits from bug 292865

The alternative would be to replace the call to setTabTitleLoading with

tab.label = tabbrowser.mStringBundle.getString("tabs.loading");

in nsSessionStore.js. However that seems a little bit too hacky IMO (after all, the string bundle is supposed to be private).
We should just land all of bug 292865's patch.
I backed out the patch for bug 338661. We can reland it on the branch when 292865's patch lands, so I think this bug can be closed now.
