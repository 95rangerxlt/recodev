It's generally not safe to allow using an http:// page for self-support, so we should add code to only allow loading https URIs.

This will also require changing the dummy URLs used in Talos (similar bug 1138823) and in addon-sdk/source/python-lib/cuddlefish/prefs.py and addon-sdk/source/test/preferences/no-connections.json.

Thanks for reporting this. It's on my radar and I'll be working on it asap :)

This patch makes SelfSupport backend report an error if the self support URL is not using HTTPS. It also changes tests accordingly.

What about convenient local testing or developing without https?
For other components we allow overrides with a hidden pref (with no default value).
Prefs can be abuse, easy enough to modify the relevant code locally for dev testing.

you are aware this will resolve to a 404, but http vs https will still be valid :)

The other fonts are uppercase, while this is lowercase. Is it the same? Maybe we should keep the case to be consistent with the other entries. What do you think?
I had to think about that for a moment, I will fix it to be uppercase and land it!
