We need to disable this pref in 40 due to problems attached to bug 1195607.
Some documentation:
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Hotfix
* http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/firefox-hotfixes/file/tip/README

Previous pref-flip hotfix that you can `hg copy`:
* https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/firefox-hotfixes/file/tip/v20150402.01

Note that if you hotfix a pref-flip you likely should change the pref name for future builds so they users who have the pref flipped won't be stuck in that state for the future.
Aaron, does that help? 

Sylvestre, I tracked this and am needinfoing you so you don't miss it. 

We should probably file a followup bug to change the pref name for 41+.

Patch
The patch seems to be doing a rename instead of a copy. Please fix this before landing.

Fixed. Thanks for catching that.

Felipe, thanks for the prompt review!

OK, thanks Liz! Please go ahead with the hotfix!

This fix would automatically reflect on all FF 40 clients irrespective of any firefox browser setting I assume? Is that correct? Or what needs to be enabled to see this fix?
Once it goes live it will be deployed to all versions of Firefox with automatic updates enabled. It hasn't gone live yet though.
This went live last night in bug 1196078, and should be in place now for Firefox 40 on all platforms.
Please change the default value of the prefs in beta41 and release40.0.3 tree.
Because the hotfix seems too slooooooooooooow to deployment through network for new profile.
See Bug 1198590. The pref has been disabled with Firefox 40.0.3.
Firefox 40.0.3 won't be proposed when i ask update from Firefox 40.0.2. Is it still beta?

40.0.3 is still building.

Hotfixes get out to users faster than Firefox updates do. That said, including a disabling patch in 40.0.3 was surely the right thing to do in any case.
Thanks for version 40.0.3, the problem is fixed
Welcome.
Fixing 40 as we pushed the hotfix & shipped 40.0.3
