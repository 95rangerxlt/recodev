How can you tell this is a memory leak?

I understand this bug to mean that your window object sometimes has a 

  chrome://global/content/bindings/resizer.xml#resizer

property on it.  That's not necessarily a leak.

Moreover, I can't reproduce that behavior.

I test firefox nightly and Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0

chrome://global/content/bindings/resizer.xml#resizer xxxxxx just like something memory address
Okay, I see this on a Windows machine.  On Linux, the alert reads "null", as expected.

I still don't think this is a memory leak, though.  This looks pretty benign, to be honest.
Ok. if it's not memory leak. leave it alone

Justin: I see this resizer.xml in the Web Console on Linux as well. Do you know why it show on the window object?
Fixed by bug 990290.
