I think we should disable the "Menu Bar" option if we're using a window where the menubar cannot be displayed.

Actually, thinking about this more, there are bugs on file about some of those popup windows making it "impossible" to print if you are a heavy mouse user and/or don't know about keyboard shortcuts. How hard would it be to just fix this to show the menu bar?

So this is slightly more complicated because if your main browser window has the menubar permanently on, this problem happens as soon as you open the window. :-\

Increase space in the chromehidden situation

This WFM in the sense that there is no more difference in how far the menubar is from the top. It doesn't fix the issue that using the menu bar toggle does not have any effect in this window (but this is the same on Nightly, and I'm not brave enough to unilaterally decide that we won't honor website's preferences in this respect anymore).
