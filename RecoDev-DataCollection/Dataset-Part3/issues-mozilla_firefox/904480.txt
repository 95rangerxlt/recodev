We don't actually use the return values of these two functions, so let's clean this up and turn the 'return' statements into function calls.

I've started working on this one. Will update with questions/concerns/patch.

Edits _SessionFile.jsm

This is my first time making a patch. I had to manually edit this (and another) one because I didn't realize how Mercurial worked so I had the two bug fixes combined into one patch. Hopefully this works, otherwise I can try to edit the patch again or just upload that combined patch.

Thank you Andrew, that patch looks great. The only problem is that I unfortunately can't apply your patch on my Unix machine - that is caused by DOS line endings. Can you please set your editor to use Unix-style line endings, re-save your files and generate a new patch? Thanks!

Thanks Andrew, this looks great! Can you please prepare the patch for checkin-needed? That means giving it a description like "Bug 12345 - Test bug; r=reviewer", uploading it again and adding the 'checkin-needed' keyword to the bug.

Bug 904480 - Test bug: r=reviewer

checkin-needed
Like that? There wasn't a field specifically for keywords.
That's not quite right, sorry. Please see bug 901126 comment #20 on how to do this.

No worries, we all had to get used to that process :) Thanks a lot for your patches, both of them should be landed soon!
