The filter button for filtering console.log() etc messages should be renamed from "Web Developer".

I was talking to a web dev, and he said "I don't use that 'Web Developer' button, whatever that is". I remember an initial confusion with the naming too, and continuing confusion even though I know what it is now.

I suggest "Logging".

Yeah, that makes more sense to me.
Commented in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=703615#c2 too, but I forgot to mention here that potch also suggested merging the 'Web Developer' options under 'JS'.

Respectfully disagree because of what I said in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=703615#c3.

Patch looks good. Thank you Sonny!

Please also update the localization note.

Axel: should we rename the property name as well?
(obviously not Axel) Yes, please rename the property to make all localizers aware of this change. 

Not sure if the "page" explanation in the localization note is still needed, since "Logging" is easier to understand. Maybe this is enough?

# This is used as the label for the "Logging" button on the toolbar. It
# shows or hides messages that the web developer inserted on the page for
# debugging purposes, using calls such console.log() and console.error().
I think we should conserve the page explanation because others menus are about logging stuffs too.
Tell me what you think.

Yes, you need to change the property name.

Still need to replace "Web Developer" with "Logging" here. Looks good otherwise. Thanks!
