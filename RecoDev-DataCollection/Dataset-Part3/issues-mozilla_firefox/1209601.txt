My hope was that you wouldn't need to toggle and could just access AlertsService.doNotDisturbTemporarily. Did that not work?
Imagine in the future if there are notifications for toggling this, we wouldn't want code to run in this case.

Since this is running in-content you should be able to use console.error which would include more info such as the URL I think.

This isn't really a TODO since the correct behaviour is to not run the rest. i.e. if someone is going through TODO to find things to test/fix, this wouldn't be one to consider. ok(true, â€¦) is better IMO.

The getter name should perhaps be changed to mention DND if that's what it's actually looking for.

Nit: This should return null or undefined explicitly since a getter should return a value.

This functionality doesn't belong in the settings, since this is only a temporary pref whereas all other prefs are persistent in the settings page.

Can you file a new bug to figure out a better place or wording for this?
