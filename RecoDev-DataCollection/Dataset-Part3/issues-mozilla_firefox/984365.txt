In particular, we'd like to:

 * Collect a boolean of whether or not the bookmarks toolbar is open
 * Collect the number of times a bookmark is opened from clicking items within the bookmarks toolbar

This is the first UITelemetry probe that will be applicable in Australis-land, so this'll give us a good excuse to land bug 942244 on mozilla-central as well.

Patch v1

Logs clicks on PersonalToolbar items that are containers and items that are not containers.

mak - are there other things that can go inside PlacesToolbarItems that I'm not considering? So far, I'm just differentiating with the container attribute...

It depends if you care about measuring the chevron, it's an overflow of the toolbar, so if you care to measure the toolbar usage you should probably take it into account. That is also connected to whether you intend to count clicks on items that are inside containers on the toolbar, this code doesn't seem to differentiate at first glance (on Mac it may be more common to mousedown a menu and mouseup on an item inside it.

Is there nothing else in here? What if I click an empty part of the bookmarks toolbar?
Oh, and it doesn't look like you've addressed comment #3... do we not care about items in the chevron?

I don't think we care about that case (we don't care about clicks on empty parts of the other toolbars either.

Ah, but we do care about that case. Thanks for reminding me!

Sure, but you'd register the mouseup, end up in this handler, and register it as clicking an item, if I understand the current code correctly (unless the PlacesToolbarItems node has a container attribute, too).

Ignore items that don't have the bookmark-item class.

Patch v1.6 - non-Australis

Good call, Gijs - I was actually recording clicks on the empty space. This patch only reacts to clicks on bookmark-items in the bookmarks bar now.

Dumb question: can a node have container="false" ? Otherwise, this seems fine.

According to mak, it's just "true", or not present at all, so I think we're good here. Thanks for the review!
