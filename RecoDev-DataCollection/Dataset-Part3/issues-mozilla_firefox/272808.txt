Apologies. The ffbug01.gif screenshot shows the _correct_ rendering of the page.
The ffbug02.gif screenshot shows the error.

There is a single gif (http://cuppanews/images/images/cn_images/bgTile.gif) that
produces the effect of a tiled repeat-y background for each of the columns.

I did have a javascript attached to the page (nicetitle.js) which I've since
disabled. The problem is still there. The problem doesn't exist in IE6 (with or
without the javascript).
Can please you provide us with a url, or a testcase so that this can be
investigated.
Thank you for the quick response.

I've set up a test case for you at
http://cuppanews.com/images/pub/testcase/index.html. I'm using the HTML
generated by ExpressionEngine and the same CSS as in the "real" site. The page
in this test loaded correctly, but after the first refresh, showed the problem
I've described. I'd suggest loading it, leaving it for the first refresh (240
seconds), and then checking it.
Just realized now that, now only is the "wrapper" div bkgd not being redrawn,
but neither is the border or bkgd of the "footer" div.
Yeah I'm seeing this too. Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2
Sorry, I managed to screw up the test case. Until I fix that, I've opened up
access to the "real" site. Just go to http://cuppanews.com.
OK, test case is fine now (http://cuppanews.com/images/pub/testcase/index.html).
I'm turning off access to "real" site so that I can get back to work on it.
Sorry again for the interruptions!
I experenced this problem with Firefox 1.0 but not with 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20041201
Firefox/1.0+

Which means it has allready been fixed in the trunk.
Thanks for the followup. I'll look forward to seeing this fix in the next
release of Firefox.
