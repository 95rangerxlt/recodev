Where is this called from and why is it not covered by <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/989c1c75889c/browser/base/content/browser-thumbnails.js#l128>?

This doesn't look right to me. Neither updatePreviews nor updatePreview directly mess with the content window and the path that would do it should already be covered.

Please suggest an alternative fix then.  I don't understand how else we would fix this.
It seems like tabPreviews_capture should guard the PageThumbs_captureToCanvas call with a gMultiProcessBrowser check.
It could also just return early:

if (gMultiProcessBrowser)
  return new Image;
