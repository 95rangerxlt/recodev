[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
Sigh. Yes, this got missed. I think we were assuming we'd have a Nightly to verify all the L10N stuff before enabling, but then we YOLO-landed everything to make the schedule. :(

Patch is trivial, will take "what do we do for beta1" to a release-drivers thread.

Patch v.1
Landed on m-r for an immediate respin for 38.0.5 beta1, build2. 

https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/rev/fff143cacb66
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/569d3999242d
Tested Spanish again, I have a Pocket button and strings localized in Spanish in the UI.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/569d3999242d
Verified that de, es-Es, ja and ru locales have Pocket enabled using Firefox 38.0.5 beta 1 build 2 under Win 7 64-bit, Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit and Mac OS X 10.9.5.

Please note that ja locale doesn't have Pocket installed under Mac OSX, probably because the build here is named ja-JP-mac.
Also under OS X, the elements in the Pocket drop-down for the ru build are not aligned.

There is no icon for other locales.
Justin, can you please take a look at the above comment and let us know the next actions?
Petruta, are bugs filed for those yet?

Also, for ja-JP-mac, it'd be interesting to know if fixing browser.pocket.enabledLocales to include ja-JP-mac fixes the issue. I wonder if the pocket strings would need adjustments, too.
