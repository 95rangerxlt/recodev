The stopwatch icon is used in the network monitor, the profiler and the canvas debugger (I think). Let's add support for HDPI in each of those tools (for the stopwatch icon).

The stopwatch icon is used in the network monitor, the profiler and the canvas debugger (I think). Let's add support for HDPI in each of those tools (for the stopwatch icon).
For this bug, I was hesitating between :
- Using directly tool-profiler.svg (we do something similar with the settings icon in the debugger)
- Copying tool-profiler.svg and rename it to the current icon name (to avoid confusion)
- Using the 2x icon provided by shorlander (I see no advantage here)

What do you think is best ?

I'm thinking 1 or 2 since we already have a vector version of this icon.  Let's go with 2, making a new profiler-stopwatch.svg icon to replace instances of profiler-stopwatch.png.

For now let's keep the checked and normal state in separate files. We can sprite them in a followup

I don't think we still need the -moz-image-region here (and in all the other places in the patch that it is used) - it is no longer a sprite.

Also, I'm seeing some weirdness when setting layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 2: https://i.imgur.com/KxEYZ30.png.  We may need to convert these to background-images or have some sort of sizing on list-image.

Is this a new issue that you found when working on this?  It doesn't seem like switching the image would affect the filter that was being applied

This issue was present before already. But I could put the change in light-theme.css if you like.

Actually, can you add it in toolbars.inc.css?  There are a list of rules to deal with the filters there
