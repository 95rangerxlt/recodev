nsFormHistory.cpp calls NS_QuickSort() to sort an array of PRUint32s, but it
passes in sizeof(nsIMdbRow*) as the size of the items to sort. That happens to
work on 32-bit platforms, but not on 64-bit platforms where sizeof(nsIMdbRow*)
!= sizeof(PRUint32)... Patch coming up.

Pass in the correct size, and don't waste time sorting n' allocing when there's nothing to sort... (diff -w)
