The bookmark pupup dialog now shows a star (yellow or white, depending on the state). This seems to be a windows-style star. I did not see this icon listed in the inventory, is this only temporary or do we need tango-style stars in 48x48 size?

It's probably Winstripe.
The 48x48 star icon was added at the last minute.  I'll be adding it to the icon inventory for milestone 3 (working on that now), but you can start creating one in the tango style, we also need an unstarred version.
Already done, I will attach it to the M2 icons bug which also has the missing rss, key and block icons.

You guys are disturbingly efficient :)
It's now fixed, I think.
