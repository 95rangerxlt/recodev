Fix v.1

Between the no-bug creation of /browser/extensions/layout-debug, and the "make /extensions/layout-debug work for Firefox" of bug 278859, we build two ways: if you build Firefox with make -f client.mk build, you get browser/extensions/layout-debug's Fx-only version, if you cd objdir/extensions and make, you get the Fx/Sm shared version. Not an actual problem, yet, but it's only a matter of time.
