As master in these cases can you look on this issue?
I can't reproduce this on Nightly. How are you closing the tab? Are you doing this with a clean Firefox profile? Is the tab in the background or the foreground?
1. I start local WebServer with my 2 files from attached ZIP.
2. I open only 1 Tab(dont happend if any other tabs opened) and write adress http://127.0.0.1/fftest/ and press return. 
3. Click on "new Tab"
4. new tab is in foreground and i click small "close tab" button.

may be its bug only on FF 37?
its happend too if i install actual Firefox on clear Windows XP on Virtualbox.
I can't reproduce it too.

@ Juri Hahn - you can try testing this using latest Nightly ( https://nightly.mozilla.org/ )
its dont happend on Nightly, but its BUG on FF 37.0.2
I can reproduce on 37, and it looks like the reason it's fixed later may be somewhat coincidental... (I see JS errors in the console), so I'm going to poke at this some more.

Boris... strange question perhaps, but is window.close meant to work from onbeforeunload?
If I have both of the tabs open and try to close Nightly, I see JS infinite loops in tabbrowser.xml... unless Core is allowing things to happen that it shouldn't be, this begins to seem like a frontend issue to me... Tim, CC'ing you per your previous work on some of this. If you have ideas, that'd be helpful.
From IRC:

09:55	Gijs	aaaaaaaaargh
09:56	Gijs	goodness do I hate XBL sometimes
09:56	Gijs	ttaubert: so, wanna hear something fun?
09:56	Gijs	ttaubert: remember how we do some magic to keep track of whether a tab is closed by keeping track of it in a "closing" field? :)
09:57	Gijs	specifically http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-cen...ase/content/tabbrowser.xml#2144 and various other checks
09:58	Gijs	ttaubert: so "closing" is a XBL field
09:58	Gijs	ttaubert: guess what happens when the tab gets removed from the DOM? That's right, we kill off the XBL field.

I have a patch, but I want a test, too.

r=me with a better solution for waiting until the tab opened by window.load() has finished loading.

Can we access contentDocument.readyState without a CPOW? Can't we just call window.open() from the content task and listen for load events there to trigger when the task resolves?

Just to make sure, maybe add a check the .closing=true right after clicking the close button.

IE asks ("This website is trying to close the tab"). Funnily enough, IE asks even if you close the tab yourself...

Chrome keeps hanging if I try to navigate away from the tab that gets opened by script while the devtools are opened. If I don't open the devtools, it doesn't let you close the tab.

Seems to me like we should not let beforeunload close the tab if you navigate the page to somewhere else... I'll file a separate bug.

FF 38 have problem with my example, if i close new tab first time: its ok. But if i open and close new tab second time its crashed...

This fix was checked in for Firefox 41, which is what "FIXED" means here, so please don't reopen the bug based on the behaviour in 38. I'll investigate and see if it makes sense to uplift this.
Also, if the browser crashed, can you go to about:crashes and give us the link of the crashreport corresponding to that crash?
hm... Crashed... its not work for any time and than showing message:
Script: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml:2216

its stoped to work and i can select: ignore and run, break this script or debug it...
and if i select break(stop) script, both tabs are closed.
I can reproduce the issue in comment #19 if I unapply my patch. I'm going to request it be uplifted to Firefox 39 and 40; I don't think it's safe enough to uplift to 38.0.5. Firefox 39 is currently in beta ( https://beta.mozilla.org/ ) and should be released in a little over a month from now.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: n/a -- issue with the browser not dealing well with tabs that close themselves while they are being closed
[User impact if declined]: browser hangs / internal bookkeeping of tabbrowser gets very confused
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: has a test!
[Risks and why]: low. The fix is a correctness fix which really really shouldn't be breaking anything else, only fixing our keeping track of which tabs have already closed, so it's pretty safe. Just don't want this on 38.0.5 ("release") because there's almost 0 time to shake out any issues. It *has* baked on Nightly for a bit, and I went through issues filed in the last week that mention "tab", and saw nothing relevant to tabbrowser behaviour / this bug.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: no.

Approved for uplift to aurora (40) and beta (39). This has had some time on Nightly without obvious problems.
Andrei, this is one I'd love to see tested for the test build of 39.0b1 build 1 which should show up for your team tomorrow. If you have time from your testing of 38.0.5! Thanks.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/d2cc6cf1930e

Backed out for browser_tabs_close_beforeunload.js timeouts.
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/10093acd851e

This initially hit a lot of problems due to Beta39 not having all the necessary BrowserTestUtils functionality the new tests use. I backported what I could and got those cleared up, but in the end, it was still timing out and I had to wave the white flag :(
(Clearing Andrei's needinfo because this didn't make b1)

Tim, it seems like sessionstore:update never "isFinal" on beta because beta doesn't have bug 1109875. Is that safe to uplift at all? And if not, I guess we should remove removeTab from BrowserTestUtils, and reimplement 'wait for the tab to close' some other way in the test?
I think it would be fine to just replace the |yield removeTab()| with simple gBrowser.removeTab() calls. Closing tabs is sync on Beta so that should just work.
Tracking in case you end up trying to uplift again.
Yes, I need to make a branch patch and land it. Not hard, need to just not forget. Will try to get to this Tuesday (not here tomorrow or Monday)
