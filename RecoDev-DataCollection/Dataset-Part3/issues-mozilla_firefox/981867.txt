I noticed that the tooltip for the CSS category mentions only "CSS parsing errors". Going forward this will include a broader class of CSS-related warnings and errors, so we should update the tooltip.

Make the tooltip for the web console CSS category more general.

A one liner to make the tooltip more general and remove the focus on parsing.

You need to update the entity name of the string, so that localizers will be aware of your change.
Please see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Making_String_Changes

Since Aurora is string frozen it's too late for Firefox 30, but please land a follow up patch on m-c

Good catch, noticed locally by coincidence, apparently most locales haven’t:
 http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla-aurora/search?string=btnPageCSS.tooltip&find=&findi=&filter=^[^\0]*%24&hitlimit=&tree=l10n-mozilla-aurora

Any action needed?

Yes, opening a bug and attaching a patch. I put that in my TODO if nobody does it before me.
