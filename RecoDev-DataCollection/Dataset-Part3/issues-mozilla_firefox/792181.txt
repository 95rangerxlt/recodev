Questions from email for this bug

I am fairly certain that it would suppress all WN pages for that version. Is that ok?

Regarding assigning it to me, when do you need this by?

Yep - that'd be great. As long as 16->17 isn't suppressed (we may want a WN page there).

Next Tuesday would be the beta 5 go to build, so it'd be great to get it into the build prior.
Also, since this will only be needed on the Firefox 16 train it only needs to land there.

Patch rev1 - tested - beta branch only
Is getPostUpdateOverridePage garanteed to be called in all cases? Wouldn't it be safer to also remove the values of the startup.homepage* prefs?

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-beta/source/browser/branding/official/pref/firefox-branding.js#5
to be honest, if I were to go with a "safer" method I would prefer to do it with code removal and not with pref removal.

I'll stop my other work on the stub installer and dive further into this to make doubly sure.

Thanks, I should have realized that would happen with the removal of the code it tests. :(

Verified that the "What's new page" is suppressed when updating to Firefox 16 beta 6 (used the test case from Comment 22 - Bug 789422).
