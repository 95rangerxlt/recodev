Ryan, 90% of this patch is re-indenting the comments and replacing utf8 dots with normal dots (it always bugged me to see garbage in my diffs).

Also, I thought I could drop the magic pipe behavior (not setting a host creates a pipe transport) and just use this new transport argument and create the pipe transport by doing: connection.connect(DebuggerServer.connectPipe()), but for some reason, creating the pipe transport too early would break tests. I didn't figure out why (it doesn't look trivial (to me)).

Anyway, this is required for feverdream.

I'm surprised that creating the pipe early like you say breaks tests...  but this approach seems fines, so I am not worried about it.

Huh, I've never noticed this issue in the past...  Guess I've never tried non-ASCII chars before.  Some searching suggests the combo of git & less is to blame, since git without a pager does the right thing, but I couldn't find a way to get it working.

I guess I would have used an asterisk, but periods are fine too. :)

This default value seems unnecessary...  It will just end up undefined if it's not passed in, which works the same for your various if checks.

Allow connection-manager to use a custom transport

Updated to remove the default value.
