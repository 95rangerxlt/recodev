In FF 3.0 RC 1, double clicking on Unsorted Bookmarks in the Library window causes 100% CPU use and takes over 3 seconds to open the folder, even when there are no bookmarks in this folder.  This bug does not occur in FF 3.0 Beta 5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the Library window using the menu: Bookmarks > Organize Bookmarks
2. Double click on the Unsorted Bookmarks folder
Actual Results:  
100% CPU usage and over 3 seconds to open the folder

Expected Results:  
Should open up almost immediately, with relatively little CPU usage (as per FF 3.0 beta 5).

Is this still visible in latest version?

I can't reproduce, can you try launching firefox (safe mode) if that still happens?
Yes, I just confirmed this behaviour this morning in the following version:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1pre) Gecko/20080905031348 Minefield/3.1b1pre

The bug is reproducible in safe mode as well.

I did, however, find one important difference that I didn't record in the original bug report: this bug only occurs when using the right pane of the Library window, and not the left.

In the Library window, you have two options for opening a folder: single clicking with the mouse in the left pane, or pressing the Enter key (or double clicking with the mouse) in the right pane.  Using the first method doesn't cause the bug; using the second does.
In addition to causing 100% CPU usage, this bug leaks memory as well.

Also note that this bug also occurs in Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 using the following version:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Firefox/3.0.1
can you guess how many bookmarks do you have inside Unsorted Bookmarks?
Inside Unsorted Bookmarks, zero.  Which is why this bug is so strange.

In total, I figure I have somewhere between 2000 and 3000 bookmarks.

How did you obtain this information?

Looks like I spoke too soon here.  When I double click on Unsorted Bookmarks, I can see the Firefox memory usage climb 7-8 MB in the Task Manager.  However, if I wait a little bit longer, I see that within 2-3 seconds it falls back to its previous usage.
Not going to block the 3.1 release, due to spotty reproduction. Please renominate if you have solid STR.

could be potentially solved by bug 475273
can anyone reproduce on current trunk or 1.9.1 branch?
resolving as fixed by bug 475273, in case this happens still on trunk or 1.9.1 branch, feel free to reopen.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
