A popup window containing form submitting code doesn't seem to work.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Open the URL provided. Find the form at the bottom right of the page. It's a
loan application type of thing. Enter a number - 100000 and press the button
labelled 'Beregn din ydelse'.

A popup window appears. The html has an onload spec in the body tag that says to
submit the form, but nothing seems to happen. No warnings either.

Actual Results:  
Blank popup window


Expected Results:  
Results from form submission appearing inside the popup window. Try in Internet
Explorer - works fine there.


As far as I can tell this should really work. If I am mistaken and this turns
out to be a problem on the web site of the url provided, I naturally apologize.

I took the liberty of setting the severity up one notch from a trivial bug
because I've seen it on a couple of other web sites as well, and it really is
annoying because you have to start up IE to get the expected results.

The page throws a dozen+ JavaScript errors.  It's probably using some IE
specific coding.

Probably? You mean you don't really care to find out? I'm sorry, that was
one lazy answer I think.

I get a couple (not dozens) of JavaScript errors on the original page, but
only errors that relate to the fancy navigation menu they use on the page.
The problem I describe has nothing to do with the menu navigation.

The code in the popup window that appears when you press the 'Beregn din
ydelse' button does not contain any javascript at all. Only:

<html><head><title>GE Capital Bank</title></head><body
onload='MyForm.submit()'><form name='MyForm' id='MyForm' method='post'
action=Calculate.asp><input id='LoanType' name='LoanType' type='hidden'
value='2'><input id='LoanAmount' name='LoanAmount' type='hidden'
value='100000'><input id='LoanPeriod' name='LoanPeriod' type='hidden'
value='6'></form></body></html>

In the JavaScript console an error appears that says simply "MyForm is
undefined". If you look at the code this seems incorrect. IE runs the onload
code without incident.

I appreciate your help but if you are going to look at this then please do
it properly.
works for me with 1.0PR on win2k.
