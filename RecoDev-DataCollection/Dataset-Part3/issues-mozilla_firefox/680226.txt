In Bug 660905 Comment 16 we made a change so this extension would not be available for users above Firefox 5. However, during testing I found I can install it in both Firefox 6 and 7 (See attached screenshot).

Currently it ranks as the #12 top crash on Firefox 6 and is again correlated to this addon.

I looked at the add-on history and there was no other activity after I changed the maxVersion down to 5.*. I have changed it again. Let's see if it sticks this time...

On a separate note, version 1.6.1 is pending review and claims compatibility up to Firefox 8. Are there any crash stats related to this version?
