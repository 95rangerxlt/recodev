Actual Results:  
A green jigsaw-piece is displayed . Clicking it fires up plugin finder which

Page works for me, despite the 53 errors
written with IE in mind,

The buttons in the main body of the page (i.e. all buttons below "Websites of
Railways which have helped inspire this layout") are Java Applets, and so need a
Java Virtual Machine installed, for example from http://java.sun.com/.

The links at the top of the page are using Javascript to swap the images, so no
plugin is needed for them.

I'm surprised that Firefox couldn't figure out that it needed the Java plugin -
I'm sure I've seen it detect correctly for other pages containing applets. My
instinct is to blame FrontPage, but that may be unfair.

Should this be under "Plugin Finder Service" rather than "General"?

=============

It's a pretty important fundamental fault. Whether or not MS Frontpage is to
"blame" or not. Is it possible to modify Firefox to look for this plug-in? There
must be literally millions of websites created this way. Reiterating: this was a
totally standard, automatically generated website created and published from
within MS Frontpage without any manual intervention. I can't write HTML, so it
has not been altered in any way.

Further info: Loading the java virtual machine download from the site suggested
above fixes it immediately.

Thanks for the info.  I'm OK now but millions might not be. :-)
Should this loophole be plugged? Should Firefox need to be able to realise this
plugin is missing as initial setup?
Would somebody who knows more than I please decide if this problem needs to be
elevated and fixed on the next release?
