patch

- this affects Orion's use of GCLI because Orion's use of dojo creates elements that currently throw off the positioning of GCLI's input elements

Steps:
- start with the example index.html from GCLI's root dir
- put its "gcli-display" and "gcli-input" elements into a div, so that they now look like:

<div style="position:absolute;top:100px;width:100%;height:70%;">
  <div id="gcli-display"></div>
  <input id="gcli-input" type="text" autofocus/>
</div>

- view the page
- the GCLI-created input elements are placed incorrectly because their absolute positions are computed in Inputter.prototype.getDimensions() relative to the document origin, but if there's a 'fixed' or 'absolute' ancestor then at render time this position will be considered to be relative to that element, not to the document origin

- patch that demonstrates a possible fix is attached

This code should not affect firefox, but does alter gcli.jsm so we need to check that there is no breakage.

Updates for gcli.jsm

Minor fix. We need to ensure that we're using the correct document. This is important both for when gcli is in an iframe, and for when it's embedded in a xul document.
