for completeness:

hatted with sayrer over irc about this patch.

this patch duplicates some code in the livemarks service into the toolbar code, so that on start up, we don't have to instantiate the livemarks service (and do all the work it will do on instantiation.

note to qa, this is on all platforms, but you need --enable-places-bookmarks to test it.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
