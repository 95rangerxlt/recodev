Bookmarks sidebar context menu items are disabled after loading bookmark on the backround from the sidebar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground = true so the bookmark is loaded on the backround when it's opened on new tab.
2. Open the bookmarks sidebar and open any bookmark on new tab.
3. Open the context menu for any other bookmark except for the one you just loaded.
Actual Results:  
Menu items items in the context menu are disabled and will remain disabled for all bookmarks until bookmarks sidebar loose it's focus.


On step 3 if you open the context menu for the same bookmark you loaded on step 2, menu items are not initially disabled.

Yep.
Also an issue with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090420 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre ID:20090420031111

This was fixed by the patch for bug 488846.
Excuse me, as I'm not totally familiar with all aspects of Bugzilla.

Do I understand correctly that this is solved, but is blocked by another bug/improvement?

I still experience this problem as of v3.5.3

Thank you!
This bug is fixed and will be part of the next major Firefox release (Firefox 3.6).
Perfect.  Thank you!

As always I can't wait ;)
