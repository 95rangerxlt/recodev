Document it, change some existing links

I changed some links that point to the existing prefs location for updates to
point to the new menu item, because it's far more useful for updating.	Now
that updating's accessible from elsewhere, the update prefs really are
"advanced".

r=me.
We have to be aware that the menu item is to be moved to the Help menu though
(http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:1.1_Software_Update_UI).
But that's a trivial change once this patch is in.
Patch checked in.
