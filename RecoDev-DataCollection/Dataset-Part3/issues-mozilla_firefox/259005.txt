Currently when a user selects Print Preview, the statusbar for the previewed
page remains visible. This means that the user can create live bookmarks, change
pop-up settings, and switch stylesheets (bug 258800) using the statusbar icons -
which really have nothing to do with printing and, thus, is confusing to the
user. The only reason currently for showing the statusbar might be to show that
the page is secure, but the user should be aware of this before even printing.
For what it is worth, IE hides the statusbar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit a site that triggers a statusbar icon (like http://www.mozilla.org/).
2.Select Print Preview.

Actual Results:  
You can still access the statusbar icon (in the case of mozilla.org you can set
a live bookmark).

Expected Results:  
Hidden access to any site triggered statusbar icons.

Another acceptable option would be to follow the approach in bug 258800 and
leave the statusbar visible, but collapse all of the icons. This would also
allow for the security icon to remain visible, if desired.

This is also similar to bug 257178.

unlikely that there is time to get this into 1.0 -- renominate if a patch appears.

patch

This patch will hide the status-bar when you go into print preview. I have
tested it by manually applying the patch and have not run into to problems. I
don't have much programming experience (at least not in programming for
applications), so this diff was blatantly stolen from bug 258800.
Renominating as there is now a patch. On a side note, how do I make a review
request?
Also, if this patch gets checked in, you might want to update the comments:

  //   (*) sidebar
+ //   (*) statusbar
  //   (*) find bar
So why don't you update your patch with the added comment?
You should call it "statusbar", not "statusbars".
For bonus points, create your patch with "cvs diff -up8". '8' is for additional
context, and 'p' shows the function your changes are in.

To make a review request, click on Edit next to the patch, set "review" to "?"
and add the requestee in the textbox. The list of Firefox reviewers is here:
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/review.html
Choose on of the first three, or mconnor@steelgryphon.com.

updated patch

Thanks Steffen for your help - I think I have covered all of your concerns with
this patch. I have never used CVS before (or a diff for that matter), so this
is a bit of a learning experience for me. If I have made any more mistakes,
please let me know.
