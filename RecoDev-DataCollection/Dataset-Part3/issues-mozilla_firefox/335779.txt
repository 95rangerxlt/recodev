Bug 232272 introduced a new Search Engine Manager.

At the very least we need to change this sentence in Using Firefox - Searching - Searching the Web: "Select Add Engines... to install additional Search Engines" since "Add Engines..." has been replaced by "Manage Search Engines...".
Also, bug 317107 changed the "search for selected words" context menu command from using the default search engine to using to current engine.

patch

I've added new sections "Selecting the Search Engine to use" and "Manage Search Engines". I've also addressed the new "search for selected words" behavior.
Would be nice to have for a2, but that's only a few days ahead.
Gavin, is this ready for documentation, or should we wait for things like
"reset defaults"? I don't have your buglist, but this one looks like a candidate.
I don't expect the current manager functions to change. Additions may be made (e.g. drag and drop, "restore defaults"), but I don't think those make any of the documentation already submitted by Steffen incorrect.

If images are turned off, "as pictured below" makes no sense, particularly since there's no alternate text.  Since the image is mostly superfluous, let's replace " as pictured below:" with a period and either keep or remove the image.  I don't think there's any real harm in leaving the image in place, but I don't see how it really helps, either.


>+<h4 id="selecting_the_search_engine">Selecting the Search Engine to use</h4>

"to use" seems unnecessary here.


>+<p>You can click on the Search Engine icon to choose another Search Engine.

This should refer to the arrow next to the icon, not to the icon itself.


>+  You can also switch between installed Search Engines by pressing
>+  &accelKey;+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> and &accelKey;+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>.

I don't think we want this sentence here since we're planning to de-emphasize that shortcut in bug 339485, but I don't think we want to replace it with an F4/Alt+Up/Down sentence.  Tell me if I'm wrong about this, tho.

This sentence (specifically the "there are" construct) is weak.  How about:

Some Search Engines, like Google, search the whole web; others, like Amazon.com, only search specific sites.


>+  <p>Select <em>Manage Search Engines...</em> to add, reorder, or remove Search

Nit: un-indent this.


>+  Engines. Select a Search Engine and click the respective button to move it up
>+  or down, or remove it.

The phrasing of the last bit of this and the single comma are a bit strange.  How about "...to move it around within the list or remove it."?  Also, I think "appropriate" is a slightly better choice of word than "respective".


> Click the <em>Get more search engines...</em>link to
>+  visit a site which offers a range of additional Search Engines.</p>

"a site which offers a range of additional Search Engines"?  There has to be a better way to write this sentence, but I'm having trouble thinking of one right now.


Anyway, there are still a few loose ends to wrap up here, so r- until we can wrap them up.

fixed.

The image is useful because people might confuse the search bar with e.g. the find bar. It needs to be updated to the new UI, but that has to wait until changes to that UI are complete.

>> +<h4 id="selecting_the_search_engine">Selecting the Search Engine to use</h4>

fixed.

>> +<p>You can click on the arrow next to the Search Engine icon to choose another Search Engine.

Indeed. So how about "You can click on the arrow next to the magnifying glass"?

>> +  You can also switch between installed Search Engines by pressing
>> +  &accelKey;+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> and &accelKey;+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>.

Yeah, let's remove it. It's not really comfortable having to press CTRL+k and then ALT+up/down to open the engine selection menu.

sure, fixed.

fixed.

both fixed.

How about "You can install additional search engines from the [link] Firefox Add-ons web site."? That's like we do it for add-ons.

Per IRC,

"...click on the arrow at the end of the Search Bar to choose..."

> How about "You can install additional search engines from the [link] Firefox
> Add-ons web site."? That's like we do it for add-ons.

It sort of sticks to see, "Bon Echo Add-ons", but I do think we want to use the &brandShortName; entity instead of directly referencing Firefox in text.  Also, don't bother with "the" or "web site" -- just do "...from [&brandShortName; Add-ons]".
Checked in trunk & branch, with comments addressed.
