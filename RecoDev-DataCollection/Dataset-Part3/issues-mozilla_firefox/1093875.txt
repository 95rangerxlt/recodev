These lines are ignoring native anon content if we aren't in a XUL document: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/inspector.js#3249-3256.

But in the case of http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/atom.xml the yellow box at the top with subscribe controls cannot be inspected.  In this case the XUL is inside of a non-XUL document.

This works for me locally, but I won't have time to get this tested and reviewable at the moment.  Probably not until next week at least, but feel free to apply the patch locally if you need it to get work done.

Patrick, there was an issue with XBL content not showing up when loaded in an HTML document (because the check was just looking at the element's ownerDocument).  I've updated this and added a test.  Pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=5e03b8dab303
