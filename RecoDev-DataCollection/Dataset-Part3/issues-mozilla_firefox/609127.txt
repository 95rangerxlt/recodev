On Firefox 4 there is a new add-on bar and widgets created with the Jetpack SDK are placed on its right.

On Mac OS X, this is also the only corner where the user can resize the window, there is a little "gripper". Unfortunately, it is placed over the widget even if it's not visible. Consequently, it's impossible to click on about half the widget's surface.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension create with Jetpack and displaying a widget.
2. Try to click on the bottom-right of the icon.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens, the onClick event is not fired.

Expected Results:  
onClick event should be fired and the associated code should be executed.

The red triangle reveals the zone where we can't click
Confirmed on beta7 build 1. Also, where is the gripper image? :/
The Add-on SDK is no longer a Mozilla Labs experiment and has become a big enough project to warrant its own Bugzilla product, so the "Add-on SDK" product has been created for it, and I am moving its bugs to that product.

To filter bugmail related to this change, filter on the word "looptid".
This needs to be fixed in Firefox, since it applies to any add-on in the bar, not just Jetpack-built add-ons.
It is not only related to the add-on bar. For the Sync error messages, the close button is in that area and only the small top portion of it can be clicked.

We need to make sure #status-bar is the right-most element. This is important for the resizer on Win XP as well.
Ehsan, which side does this effect in RTL windows on OS X, i.e. is the gripper on the left or on the right?

It is currently on the right side, but that's a bug (filed as bug 631729).  That said, the add-on icons appear on the left side in LTR mode for me, so I can't reproduce this bug in its original version in comment 0.

When I switch to RTL mode, the resizer stays on left, and the add-on bar icons move to the right, but again they don't overlap with the window resizer...

So, in short, I'm not sure how to answer comment 8, but I would love to provide a better answer if you can lead me on how to reproduce this problem.

Why does this add a ridiculous ordinal to the statusbar element? That doesn't seem necessary to fix this problem.

In addition, I know for a fact there are people who want to be able to move the statusbar element around, by placing toolbar elements on either side of it, and doing this effectively kills that ability.

Also, have you confirmed that doing this won't cause issues like Bug 602971?

See comment 7.

No, as that bug is news to me. I'll take a look at your example extension right now.
The new ordinal value also affects the add-on Nosquint.  The zoom percentage is now fixed to the very right of the status bar.  Before, I could move it around relative to the other icons on the statusbar.
Posthumous blocking+.
