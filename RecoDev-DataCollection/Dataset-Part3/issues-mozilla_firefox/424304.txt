Mochitest needed for bug 417760 - Cannot focus img with a tabindex.

Draft testcase, gives me some problems
Mats, when I run the attached testcase within the chrome testharness, I get 0 passes, 0 failures, and 0 todo's. I call the "is" function twice within the testcase. If I put an alert(elemCurr); before it, I even see that theoretically both tests should pass, because I get the correct values.

IOs this in principle the right approach, or am I on the wrong track somehow?

Thanks for your help!

Patch

This is the Mochitest for bug 417760. Johnath helped me out with the problems I was having, so these tests now pass.

You should have a backslash there.

I don't think we want an external ref to http://trac.bitstructures.com/
in case that server is down...
Easiest is probably to include an image in the same directory and
name it file_bug417760.png (that is, not using a test_ prefix).
(add it to the makefile too, next to the test_ it belongs to)

Not a requirement, but it would be nice with a third test:
an <img> without tabindex and:

      // now test the img with no tabindex attr
      focusElem("img-no-tabindex");
      checkFocus("img-tabindex-minus-1", null);

The one thing I didn't find out was how to actually put the .png file into the patch as well. I'll attach to the bug as a separate attachment and will ask that this be checked in along with the patch.

Did I understand correctly that the image without tab index is not supposed to gain focus?

Looks good. r+sr=mats

Yes, calling focus() on a non-focusable element should not have any effect.

Don't forget -kb when you add the image file:
"cvs add -kb file_bug417760.png"

Thanks, will remember that for future reference, don't have CVS access yet.

Do I need approval1.9 for this patch to land, or can I just request checkin?
Tests does not need approval.
