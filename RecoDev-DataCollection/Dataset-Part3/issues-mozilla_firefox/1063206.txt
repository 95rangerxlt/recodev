In app manager I could start an app and there was a nice big debug button that took me to the developer tools so I could see the console. 

I was completely confused on how to do this in WebIDE until dcamp saved me in IRC by pointing out that its the "pause" button. I never would have guessed that and didn't hover over it. I realise now its the same button as the "debugger" in the developer tools.

Personally I liked the word "DEBUG", but I found the pause button confusing.

Should this just be the toolbox icon that we use in the toolbars?
Perhaps, but maybe a label is still needed?  Others have mentioned the same thing.  More discussion here, so I'll dupe to this bug.
*** Bug 1055340 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
What about a showing a window with a box at the bottom with "devtools" written in it? Like this: http://i.imgur.com/ivzd9Zg.png - it's explicit and has a label.

We need help from UX.
More UX flags in case that helps...
This shouldn't block bug 1067337, but will be much easier given an icon in that bug.
