On any https site with an invalid certificate, the Untrusted Connection page shows. Unfortunately, clicking any button there does not work at all.
From searching I see these bugs seem to crop up every some releases.

Already tested with a fresh profile, so it's not extension-related.
Current regression range is after at least 3.5.5. I will attempt to narrow it down by testing previous betas.

The bug disables many SSL sites that don't want to pay for a proper certificate.

Fixed the title typo.
Last working release is Firefox 3.6 beta 2. Quite a few commits to bisect though, I could use some help.
I can confirm that and I also have bug #529779  perhaps these bugs are related... My machine is incredibly slow for compiling so I can't help much with the bisecting :(
My machine is 32bit linux but that should not really make much of a difference..
somehow this got fixed when I installed the fix for bug #531053 (don't know how they are related but it worked for me ;) )
So it's perhaps only a duplicate...
Doesn't happen in any trunk build I've tried. (both own and mozilla's)

Will check again vs latest 3.6.
This is definitely gone in 3.6.6 and up. Should've closed it a long time ago.
