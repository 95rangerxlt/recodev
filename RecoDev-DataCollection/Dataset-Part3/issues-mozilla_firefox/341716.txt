Bug 340849 replaced the "Match case" checkbox on the Find Bar with an automatic case-sensitivity detection. It searches case-insensitive unless you type any uppercase character. When searching case sensitive, it displays "(Case sensitive)".

Bug 340849 replaced the "Match case" checkbox on the Find Bar with an automatic case-sensitivity detection. It searches case-insensitive unless you type any uppercase character. When searching case sensitive, it displays "(Case sensitive)".
Here's my summary of what my patch did (this is mostly redundant with comment #0):

* Find bar no longer has a "Match case" checkbox
* Find bar's case sensitivity now has three modes, controlled by accessibility.typeaheadfind.casesensitive:
-1: Automatic case-sensitivity [default]
 0: Never case-sensitive
 1: Always case-sensitive
* Automatic mode is case-insensitive when the search string is all-lowercase, and case-sensitive otherwise.  This is similar to the behavior of emacs, less, and many other editors/text utilities.
* Whenever the Find bar is in case sensitive mode, either automatic or manual, "(Case sensitive)" appears after the Next/Previous buttons to indicate this.

The goal of this change is to fix two UI problems:
* Users who want case-sensitive searches have to move their mouse to a checkbox and click it
* Users generally want case-sensitive searches only for a particular search, and are often tripped up by the statefulness of the "Match case" checkbox

There is one use case where the new UI is poorer than the old UI -- when a user wants to do a case-sensitive search for an all-lowercase string.  This is a tradeoff.  (Users can still accomplish this by switching the pref in about:config, which will take effect immediately, but the expected behavior is that users will simply manually skip incorrect matches.)
Thanks for the detailed explanation and rationale!

Should that be "The search automatically begins as soon as you type something into the search box"?
Oops, of course.
Bug 345786 will bring back the "Match Case" checkbox. So I'll remove the sentence "The search is case-insensitive", and readd this part:
   <li><strong>Highlight</strong>: highlight occurrences of your search string
     in the current page.</li>
Err, I meant this part of course:
-    <li><strong>Match case</strong>: limit the search to text that has the
-      same capitalization as your search string.</li>
