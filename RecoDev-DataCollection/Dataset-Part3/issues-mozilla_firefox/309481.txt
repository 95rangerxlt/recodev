It seems some files were not tagged with FIREFOX_1_0_7_RELEASE, for example see
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsgraph.cgi?file=mozilla/profile/Makefile.in Version
1.12. All other Firefox 1.0.x and Mozilla 1.7.x releases are listed there, but
FF 1.0.7 is not. This should be fixed so people can build FF 1.0.7 from CVS.

This is a very odd problem.  I'll take a close look at it this morning.
Apparently around 26,750 files were tagged and 450 missed.  I'm not sure why but
it looks like the tag process exited abruptly.  This should be fixed now.
