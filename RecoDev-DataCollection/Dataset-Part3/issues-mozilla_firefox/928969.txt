-----------------------------------------------------------------

The changes outside of shumway.js and shumway-worker.js look good to me. I obviously haven't looked through those two.

However, I'd like for this to be two patches: one that introduces the Telemetry support (so the changes in the .jsm files and avm-sandbox.js) and one that contains the shumway-internal changes. The latter you can land with r=me, the former I'm not really qualified to review. You probably know who should review that. If not, I bet bsmedberg knows.
