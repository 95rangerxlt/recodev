bootstrap-fx-18-branch.cfg

New Firefox 2.0.0.x bootstrap config; I'm thinking of checking this in as
bootstrap-fx-18-branch.cfg, so we can track it as a separate file, and maybe
make boostrap.cfg an example config. What do you think, rhelmer?

oldRc should be rc3 - http://stage.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2.0.0.1-candidates/

l10n config changes for 2.0.0.2

One minor diff to this diff: I think the win32 builds are going to be put in the rc2 directory, due to bug 353948.

Do we know why this changed?

No reason to add .eu twice.

remove extra eu

Thanks for catching that extra EU. Looks like the Linux build ID was entered incorrectly for 2.0.0.1 AFAICT. I'll download a linux 2.0.0.1 build and double check this, but I am pretty sure this is the case since we QA'd it with the build ID in this patch.
