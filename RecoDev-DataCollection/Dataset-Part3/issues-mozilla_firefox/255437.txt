the new bookmarks.html file

i've also sent this file to Ben directly. the only thing that needs to be
verified is that the code for the Latest Headlines live bookmark is correct. 
otherwise, this should be ok to check in.
At the very least, I think the things in the Personal Toolbar Folder should have
ICON=... attributes to get the favicons there upon creating a new profile.


vlad, i'm not sure how to do that stuff.  can you take this over the finish line
or do I need to get Rafael to polish this up so it will be acceptable to you?

bookmarks.html with ICON attribute for personal toolbar item

Was only one thing in the personal toolbar (beside the folder), so I gave it an
icon.  However, http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/index.html uses the
mozilla icon -- it should use the firefox favicon, no?
you mean, as opposed to the Mozilla favicon?  yes, that'd be nice.  I'll ask the
Silverorange guys to add the Firefox icon to the Firefox product page, but if
you can just swap out the icon directly in bookmarks.html, that'd be even better
of course.

Bookmarks.html file, including Del.icio.us, Spreadfirefox
The new version includes two new sites (Del.icio.us and Spreadfirefox.com) and
removes the Google ID in the quick search.  I'm not sure what the RDF
identifiers are for, but tried to include RDF id's following the model.  Pls
check those.
If you want this localized, it's probably a 1.0PR thing.  (sorry for bugspam)
Yes, this is a PR blocker.  Thanks for reminding me.  I thought this issue was
already resolved (minus Del.icio.us, which is fine).  
Shouldn't there still be a Google quicksearch?
we have the search plugin, so its duplication that isn't needed.

> we have the search plugin, so its duplication that isn't needed.

Hmm.. I disagree there (re the google quicksearch).  Being able to type in
Control-L "google blah blah blah" is extremeley useful, as there is no way to
switch the active search plugin from the keyboard.
(In reply to comment #11)
> we have the search plugin, so its duplication that isn't needed.

Personally I'd prefer the opposite, pick the searches you want to ship as
default then provide them as both plugins and bookmarks, it's not as if there is
any confusing UI duplication since bookmark searches are fairly well hidden. At
the moment I can search Yahoo from the search bar but not from the address bar.
OTOH I can search stock quotes from the address bar but not the search bar. Why
are some searches provided as bookmarks and some as search plugins?

p.s. Dictionary search is provided as both a default search plugin and a
bookmark search (with attachment 156856).

On Windows at least you can use Ctrl-K Ctrl-Down (or Ctrl-Up).

I haven't even heard of most of those, and frankly having looked at some of
them, I don't think I want to associate Firefox with them at such a high level.

(The list above is all of the "Firefox Crew Picks" other than Google and
Wikipedia, the only two really high quality sites on the list.)


>    </P></DT><DT><H3 ID="rdf:#$6wPhC3">Quick Searches</H3>

I think we should add IMDB as quick search, which would probably be more used
than any of the other sites on the entire list except Google and maybe
Wikipedia.

new-bookmarks.html

I've just checked this in with favicons.  A few problems/questions:

- Do users migrating from IE get these bookmarks at the top of their bookmark
list?  If so, we might want to cut the number of top level items down to like..
two.

- I added back a google quicksearch (if someone complains loudly i'll take it
out, but I really hope it stays) and moved the Quicksearch folder to be back
underneath the personal toolbar folder -- otherwise we'd have people's own
bookmarks getting added right after the quicksearch folder, which would look
odd.

- Feedster has a too-large favicon which causes some issues (there's a bug# on
file, we essentially don't scale the icon down in bookmarks views)
- Some of the sites we have don't have favicons (lonely planet,
homestarrunner).  It looks a little odd, but whatever.

Comments/feedback?

I agree. It looks very unprofessional to list these.

><DD>Handy searches that can be performed in the addressbar

The correct terminology in Firefox is Location Bar (case intentional).	That's
the way we've referred to it in Help, and I'm all but certain I haven't seen it
any other way anywhere else.

Also, after actually looking at the file now, I've also got a few comments.

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%s">Urban Dictionary</A>

Hmm, not sure about that one.  It could go in or not go in, given that it
probably could result in visits to some things that wouldn't be particularly
"couth".

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</A>

Unless the Mozilla Foundation is getting paid for this one, I see no reason for
it to be present.  Actually, it's ad-cruft for most people, so I'd say just
take it out anyways.  I don't think it's worth making a buck or two if you'll
get people turned off by the "ads" (cf. Opera, even if removable ads in
bookmarks aren't nearly the same thing as non-removable banners or Google ads).

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craig's List</A>

Why?  This seems like a completely random pick.  Most of us *don't* live in the
San Francisco Bay Area.

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</A>

The Onion jumps towards sketchy relatively often.  It's okay a lot of the time
but not all the time.  If you want to cultivate that type of image, so be it. 
Personally, I don't think it's such a great idea.

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</A>

Blogger could be genuinely interesting to some, and it's a free service.  I'd
say keep it.

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.archive.org/movies/movies.php/">Internet Movie Archive</A>

Why is this a link to the Internet Movie Archive and not to the Internet
Archive itself?

Whatever.  It seems out of place to me, though.

>        <DT><A HREF="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</A>

Sketchy ads, if you ask me.  I can't link to a specific instance because they
were served by a PHP script.  You'll probably see one if you visit, tho.

>        <DT><A HREF="http://homestarrunner.com/">Homestarrunner</A>

Seems reasonably safe to me, and I don't see any other humor sites that I'd
keep.  Add a little levity!

>        <DT><A HREF="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/">Pitchfork Media</A>

I'd think not, given that they pushed the following ad into my face when I
visited (note the customized clothing scene):

That's a rather audience-specific site (only college students at some
colleges?) that I'd toast.

As for any other comments:
I'd toast the IDs and favicons (tho the favicons are less an issue than the
IDs).  The IDs add nothing to the file, and I don't know what happens if you
try to import a bookmarks file with IDs that duplicate IDs already present in
the bookmarks.html that's in the profile (a common activity for at least some
nightly build users).  Essentially they're cruft that bloats build size a
little.  The same goes for favicons: they bloat the download, and I don't know
that the better UI makes it worthwhile.

Anyways, it's your choice.
Remember that one of the targets for this might be businesses and schools.
Businesses don't want their users on these useless sites wasting time. Schools
might even prohibit some or many of them. So, do you want to send out something
which will be either frowned upon or outright prohibited by many of the places
you seek to use this product? 

What's wrong with a simple CNN, National Weather Service, a few search engines,
and maybe some links to government web sites? Go for the common denominator here.
The purpose for the new "Firefox Crew Picks" is to offer a set of bookmarks that
the Firefox crew considers interesting.  We don't want this to get filtered down
to a lowest common denominator.  It's mean to be spicy and interesting.  It
wants to show "the spirit of Firefox" as cutting-edge, not freaky cutting edge,
but show a number of sites that are interesting to us.

The editorial team for this folder includes myself, Blake, Ben, Vlad, Rafael and
Asa.  Feedback from others is welcome, but I'm not inclined to make many changes
to this file at this point, unless one of the editorial team members requests
such a change (I believe we've decided to take out Urban Dictionary).  We can
always make changes over the next few months (in fact, I still like the idea of
turning this into a Live Bookmark that gets regularly updated).
Spicy doesn't increase the number of sales (in this case, downloads).

Spicy WON'T get installed at schools or businesses. I guess you don't want those
people included as Firefox users either.

Schools and businesses can and will override the default bookmarks in a profile.

I wasn't aware that I was on the review team for the sites though :)  The site
list can probably get pared down some, but there's time to really finalize this
before 1.0.

I understand, but frankly, several items in the current list suck. :-)
So Firefox Help won't be included in the bookmarks anymore? Makes me a bit
confused. Sorry about the bugspam.
i know, it's a tiny one, but in the final file, wikipedia has a dot at the end,
while the other quicksearches don't have it.

Type "quote <symbol>" in the location bar to perform a stock symbol look-up

Type "wp <something>" in the location bar to look up something in Wikipedia, a
free online encyclopedia.

(it's "mierenneuken/muggenziften" as they say in dutch :) )

Bookmarks need to be updated based on this and other discussion; I'm punting the
assignee on this back to bart also.  Removed fixed-aviary1.0.
The "Stock Symbol Quicksearch" is a *simple* google search, and it's triggered 
with "quote", those three don't fit together.
Still needed?

I just looked here, and was hit with a string of profanities (I think from one
of their ads). This is not right to put into a school or business where someone
could get banned from the internet for bringing it up.
