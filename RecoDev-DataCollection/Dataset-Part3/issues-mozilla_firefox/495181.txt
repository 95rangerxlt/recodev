This control is mostly visual noise, let's just remove it like we did for the other 3 themes.  Discoverability of the ability to re-size these fields (without mousing over to investigate) isn't worth the cost of a lack of minimalism, especially on OS X.

This is a bit of a mess, because the location bar and the search bar are bigger than they look. For example, -moz-margin-start: -6px should really be -4px.
Bug 482086 and bug 482105 will solve this.
This had already been done for the firefox 3 theme, btw. For some reason that I don't know, or for no reason, it came back with a proto update.
Do we really need this? Comment 2 and 3 make me wonder why we think it's super-important to take this for Firefox 3.5 at this time in the cycle.
(at the very least we should include the comments from comment 2 in the patch)
I'll include comment 2 before landing.

Told Dao that we should try this on trunk, first. a=beltzner for mozilla-central only.

I don't think I want to mess around with this in 191 this late in the game.

Fine to keep it on trunk, though.
This bug's priority relative to the set of other polish bugs is:
P1 - Polish issue that appears in the main window, or is something that the user may encounter several times a day.
