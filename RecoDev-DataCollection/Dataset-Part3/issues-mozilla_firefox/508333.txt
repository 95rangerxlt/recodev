The Preferences/Options window in Windows does not allow the user to interact with open windows and tabs while it is open.  Clicking away from the window produces an error sound until the Preferences window is closed.  This seems an unnecessary restriction for users, and there are valid use cases of having the preferences Window open while browsing (eg looking at a site whose password has been saved).  The functionality in trunk for OSX - allowing the preferences window to be open - seems a better approach.
