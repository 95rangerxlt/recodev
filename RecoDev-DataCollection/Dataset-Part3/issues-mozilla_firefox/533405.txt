NOTE: This problem is observed only on *Windows* and not on *Mac* with Firefox 3.6 Beta 4 and *NOT* on earlier beta builds.

The Yahoo! toolbar has pop-up XUL windows tied to certain buttons known as slideout. A mouse click anywhere within the slideout causes the window to close.

For Example, Open a slideout by clicking on the gear icon in Yahoo! Toolbar. Click anywhere in the window and the slideout will close.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Yahoo! Toolbar.
2. Open a slideout but hitting the gear icon.
3. Click anywhere in the slideout.
Actual Results:  
The slideout closes instead of the click propagating to the underlying HTML element.

Expected Results:  
The slideout should not close and the click should propagate to the underlying HTML element on which the mouse cursor is.
