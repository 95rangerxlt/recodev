If I click the DOM mutation button, I get errors of the form 

Error: aEvent.target.getAttribute is not a function
Source File: resource://gre/modules/HUDService.jsm
Line: 2753

in my error console, and general misbehaviour (network logging doesn't happen, can't turn off DOM mutation display, script errors with no message or location info in the HUD itself).

That error and this one:

Error: Cannot get outputNode by id
Source File: resource://gre/modules/HUDService.jsm
Line: 2684

continue to appear periodically even after I close the HUD and switch to another tab, leading me to believe that we might be doing work even when the user has it closed.  Not sure if that's the same bug.

shaver: do you have the url where this broke? I cannot replicate the problem, but see the dom mutations not working on some pages.
I think it was on gmail.  I'll come by your desk in a bit.
Oh, ok, on GMail I see exactly that behavior. I was assuming that all event targets would be DOM nodes with getAttribute methods. That is not the case. I need to collect some sample JS to build up some test pages for this functionality. I am thinking about disabling DOM Mutation logging for now while I build a better test suite and make some changes to how I track the contentWindow event listeners in bug 568658
also, the DOM Mutation listeners are all-or-nothing right now, which turns on all of these listeners:

2712   this.trackedEvents = ['DOMSubtreeModified',
2713                         'DOMNodeInserted',
2714                         'DOMNodeRemoved',
2715                         'DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument',
2716                         'DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument',
2717                         'DOMAttrModified',
2718                         'DOMCharacterDataModified',
2719                         'DOMElementNameChanged',
2720                         'DOMAttributeNameChanged',
2721                        ];

Which really slows down the page loading. bz mentioned (in irc a while ago) he might be able to make this more efficient.

the main point is that having one button to toggle all of this is not a very nice solution for understanding Mutation events.
Filed a bug for the DOM Mutation activation UI: bug 575791
After tinkering with this I have decided it is not ready, we need to decide a few things:
1. How do we present thisin the UI since a lot of activity is lumped into the dom mutation button.

2. This code is interacting strangely with jquery and functions called in GMail, so we need to understand why it is removing the reference to the console inside of the event handler.

3. We need to focus on more primary functionality.

Passes all tests. This code will be re-worked at a later date on user repo.

r=me. for tracking purposes, please file the bug on re-adding it in the future.

Yeah, that's clearly bogus for the list of events in comment 4.  A number of those will only fire on CharacterData nodes, and others will fire on either CharacterData or Elements or DocumentType or .....
Or was there something else you were looking for from me?  Silent ccs are really hard to understand...

Sorry about that. I meant to clarify. You explained what is happening here. Thanks!
