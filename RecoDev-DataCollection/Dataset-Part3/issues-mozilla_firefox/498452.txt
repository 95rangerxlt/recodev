add urlbar delay as pref

Right now the autocomplete timeout lives as an attribute on the autocomplete element, and it defaults to 50 in the XBL binding.  There's no pref for this currently.  This patch exposes a pref for this, and sets it to the default so there should be no change in desktop Firefox.  It's useful to increase this value on other platforms where the cost of starting autocomplete is much higher.
