Should I be seeing different colors here for the hovered search result?  That's what I was assuming this was addressing, but it must be something else.

Not there :) Type @ in the searchbox to search for functions, or search for a file.

Review of attachment 8369081:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is an improvement for sure. We should also consider doing something about the hover background colors for unselected elements in both themes (it is barely visible).  We could pick a different color from the list, or maybe do something just to add a bit of contrast on hover, like:

.theme-dark .simple-list-widget-item:not(.selected):hover {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .1);
}

.theme-light .simple-list-widget-item:not(.selected):hover {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .1);
}
The hover colors were already picked from the wiki, but it guess they're pretty light. I did as you suggested and it looks better!
(although i'm going to use a very slightly lower alpha)

Addressed comments. Had to overwrite the colors in debugger.inc.css to prevent the global search look bad, but the file/function output panel uses the rgba() suggested approach.
