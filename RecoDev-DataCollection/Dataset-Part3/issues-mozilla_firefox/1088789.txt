Seeing lots of these errors while running tests on fx-team right now:

Property contained reference to invalid variable.  Error in parsing value for 'transform'.  Falling back to 'initial'." {file: "chrome://browser/skin/browser.css" line: 7287 column: 226408 source: " translateY(calc(0px - var(--negative-space)))"}

negative-space doesn't seem to be defined anywhere.

Dang, that should have been --space-above-tabbar.  I'll submit a fix

This was a mistake between reviews.  Because of a limitation with variables where I couldn't do: -var(--foo) to get a negated version of the variable I originally just added an extra variable like this:

--space-above-tabbar: 9px;
--negative-space: -9px;

Then we figured out that you could do this instead and not have to duplicate the variable name:

calc(0px - var(--foo))

So I switched to the expression but forgot to change the name in this attachment: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?bugid=1088789&action=enter :(
