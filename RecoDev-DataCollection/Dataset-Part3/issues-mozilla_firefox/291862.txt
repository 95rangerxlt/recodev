There is an error in extra-jar.mn which causes an the Dutch trunkbuilds are not
produced. I have a patch, whitch I will include.

Reproducible: Always

Normally Tim Maks handles this, but because he is away I started this bug. I
hope someone with CVS-access can check this in.

Patch which adds spaces before each line [checked in]
->NEW
The patch should fix the build issue, but one thing puzzled me while investigating
what really happens.
Do we really unconditionally require l10n to provide firefox help now?
We shipped with help in 1.0 too. What would be the problem? Also, could the
patch be checked in if it is correct so we get a Dutch testing build instead of
nothing :-)

r=me. The question about localizing help was a question in general.
And bsmedberg answered with "yes, all l10ns need to have help, even if they
just copy the en-US one over to their dir"
thanks for the review, but can someone check it in because i don't have acces 
to my computer right now.

greetings

gandalf checked it in. The change did not appear on the tinderboxes though:
 <http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Mozilla-l10n-nl>

... perhaps that takes a while.
thanks, there is always almost 3 hours between every build. so i will wait.
The problem is still there, but yesterday I noticed another problem. The images
in http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n/source/nl/browser/chrome/help/images/ could not
be viewed and that could be why the build still fails on extra-jar.mn, which
refers to those images. I already contacted Tim Maks about this and hopefully
the problem is solved if the images are correct in CVS. Since Tim Maks must be
at home again today, he can do this himself.
- ~22 hours ago i fixed the problem with the images, still no go
- ~19 hours ago i put the pl version of the extra-jar.mn in the nl trunk, still
no go
- ~16 hours ago i remove the line locale has help in defines.inc, still no go
- finalely i put a empty (with only the commen) extra-jar.mn and still it gives
the following error:

bad jar rule head at: locale/nl/help/images/cookie_ask.png        
(%chrome/help/images/cookie_ask.png) at ../../config/make-jars.pl line 556.

has anybody a clue what the problem can be?

checked in a fixed version of revision 1.7 of extra-jar.mn. Now the end-of-file 
is ok, too.
We removed ro from the build, so hopefully it will actually pull now.
windows trunk fails on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287262#c34
now, cvs update showed a lot of progress for quite a few locales :-)
thanks axel!
