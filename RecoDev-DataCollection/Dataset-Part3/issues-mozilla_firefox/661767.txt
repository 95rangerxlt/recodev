I suspect that's because the search strips http and https from the url before starting the search.
The reason is practically the same as bug 658242, since now the locationbar and the search box share the same code, they have the same behavior.

We should figure out a non-breaking (add-ons) way of matching like the old search, we could maybe add a MATCH_ANYWHERE_PLAIN behavior that won't do any magic filtering or normalization.
should have been fixed by the patch in bug 658242
