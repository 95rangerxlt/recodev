Doesn't look like all of the modules imported here are needed on startup (see bug 986323):

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/apps/src/Webapps.jsm#36

For example AppDownloadManager.jsm or WebappOSUtils.jsm
I think these may use DefineLazyModuleGetter.

I didn't check what's using WebApps.jsm on startup, though it may be worth to verify what this module does when loaded since that happens.

Also WebappManager.jsm and NativeApp.jsm

I think these should be the only modules not needed at startup.

WebappManager.jsm is already loaded lazily in nsBrowserGlue.js (in |_finalUIStartup|).

There's also a module imported by ActivitiesService.jsm that isn't needed during startup.
The two prefs are basically static, this is why I'm using those to decide whether the modules should be loaded or not.

In particular, I think "dom.webapps.useCurrentProfile" could be replaced by a #ifdef MOZ_B2G.

I changed my mind, using defineLazyModuleGetter we don't load those modules when not needed and we still support changing those prefs.
