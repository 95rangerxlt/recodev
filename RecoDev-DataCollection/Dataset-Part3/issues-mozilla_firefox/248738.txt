Your Build Identifier says 0.8 yet you say Help: About shows version 0.9?
Did you install 0.9 into the same directory as 0.8 was in without uninstalling it?

Please read http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/0.9.html and note
that you currently CANNOT install on top of old versions of Firefox.  Can you
try installing 0.9 into a clean directory and then responding whether or not you
still see the issue?

I had done a reinstall of Win2k. Thus I lost all my settings. I installed 0.9
but restored the profile from the old win2k image.

I repeated the same thing this time, but this time imported the bookmarks from
the old settings. It works fine now.
