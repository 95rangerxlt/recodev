There are currently 3 links when you select Mozilla Firefox in Control Panel:
* Help link: http://www.mozilla.com
* Support link: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox
* Update info: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox

I think two links are enough with the right values:
* Support link: http://support.mozilla.org
* Update info: http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/$(version)/releasenotes/

patch rev1

Gavin, are you ok with these links?

The link titled "Support link" is actually URLInfoAbout and is suppose to be a link to the application home page so I left it pointing to https://www.mozilla.org  for all channels.

Since we don't have release notes for anything but the release channel I've special cased adding URLInfoAbout it so it will only be added on the release channel. It was pointing to http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox on everything but release and that page has been defunct for quite some time.

HelpLink points to https://support.mozilla.org/products/firefox for all channels.

Also, remove the value in case it already exists instead of waiting for a version change.

patch rev2

>diff --git a/browser/branding/official/branding.nsi b/browser/branding/official/branding.nsi

>+!define URLUpdateInfo         "http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/${AppVersion}/releasenotes"

This should be https - and it's probably a good idea to switch URLInfoAbout to https in the other files as well, while you're at it.

>+!define HelpLink              "https://support.mozilla.org/products/firefox"

Since these tend to be "set and forget" and we don't have a great way to keep them up to date automatically, I'm tempted to suggest just using https://support.mozilla.org/ (omitting the products/firefox) in case SUMO's URL structure changes in the future. But I suppose you could ask a SUMO person about how confident they are about that URL lasting a long time.
Thanks for catching that. I fixed it and then unfixed it! :)

These aren't really set and forget... they get updated after every update.

I meant they are "set and forget" in our code, in practice, given how long it has taken us to fix this bug :/

Put the wrong link in the conditional. :(

The followup missed the push to mozilla-central so reopening for that.
