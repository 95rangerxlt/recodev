We have a hacks post coming up (Dan, do we have a date?) that we should have something to link to ideally
No firm date yet, need to confirm the calendar with Havi. Friday or this coming Tuesday are both likely, though
I've drafted a page on this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Memory

Please let me know if it covers things.
This looks really good, thank you Will!

Regarding "(no stack available)":

In addition to types of allocations we just can't currently record allocation stacks for (which you mention w/ scripts as an example), sometimes an object is allocated when there is no JS on the stack. For example, DOMEvent objects are allocated _before_ the JS is run and then the even handlers are called and passed the event. Most (maybe all?) of these exceptions are DOM-related. Probably worth mentioning because there are often many "(no stack available)" things.

Just FYI for the future: we will soon have allocation stacks for strings too.
Looks great, Will! Pinging Dan w/r/t to this so he knows it's around, there's a hacks post coming soon I believe
Thanks for the quick review Nick & Jordan!
Yep! Hacks post scheduled for Thursday, including links to the docs :)
