When the download manager automatically starts showing the new download it
doesn't get selected.

Sometimes I can see a selection being created and then removed. It's as if a
dummy download item is first inserted, and then removed and then the new one is
added.

The original fix I had for initial selection in the download manager fixes this.

Doron, sorry you didn't like that fix -- but I have complaints about this not
working and would like some fix for Firefox 1.5.

Make sure it doesn't cause problems in the extension manager.
I have to admit, I cannot reproduce this on the 1.8 branch in firefox.
oops, I somehow reset the blocking 1.8b4 without getting a mid air page
You can't repro if you get a file naming dialog in the middle.

What kinds of problems? Selection always goes to the first item both in nightly
builds and with this patch.

How do I disable getting the file naming dialog?

listens for template rebuilds.	It assumes each element has an id and that the
id stays same for each refresh, but works fine for download manager.

Aaron, could you see if that fixes the issue for you?

This also works, and Doron would prefer we use this patch for <richlistbox>.

Had to do more code to make it more generic, might be too much for branch
though.

Also removed some EM code no longer needed because of this and added code to
download manager to fix pause/continue of downloads losing selecting (they
don't rebuild the template but do other changes that can't be listened to
easily).

Mike, is this new patch from Doron better? It also fixes the problem, and Doron
prefers it.

I think you mean this._selectedItem = item here, I hope, because I don't know
what else calls this.

if gDownloadsView.selectedIndex is greater than getRowCount(), then
selectedIndex - 1 is still invalid, we should use var rows =
gDownloadsView.getRowCount(); and set gDownloadsView.selectedIndex to rows - 1;
to get the last one if selectedIndex is too high.  You do this right in the
binding.

see previous comment.  And yes, I know this is cut and paste, but it seems
wrong and we should fix it now that I've noticed.

This does seem to be the better patch, and does some necessary cleanup, though
its bigger.  Let's go with this, with comments addressed

Can you get this landed on the trunk and verified there before checking into the
branch, please.
checked into trunk
This patch made it so that if you Alt+click on a download and you have more than
a screenfull already, the new download starts scrolled off the top of the
richlistbox so you can't see it unless you scroll.
I backed this out of the branch. The original fix which still has review doesn't 
have this problem.

We can handle this in 2 ways:
1. Use the original fix after all
2. Fix Doron's fix

Doron, are you willing to look at #2 or should we just go with #1?
Backed out of trunk.

This patch seems to have at least 2 problems:
1) it scrolls off the first item when there is more than a page full of items,
so that you can't even see the item you're downloading when the dialog opens
automatically
2) If you tab to a cancel button for an ongoing download and hit Enter, the
arrow keys won't work after that.

I am going to seek a= for the original fix, which deals with the problem of
items going away in templates in one place in the code, and it works. I don't
like this need to scatter fixes piecemeal all over for each special case. We're
never going to get every one, especially because anyone can use richlistbox.

Use original fix for initial focus in <richlistbox>

We could also remove the downloads.js changes from bug 301435 if we check this
in, since they're just one special case related to avoiding invalid selection,
and it's better to deal with it all in one place.

Would probably have to special case that in downloads.js

That probably means the focus is on the dialog and not the richlistbox.

Don't have time this weekend though, will take a look monday.
We should fix the problem as close to the source of the problem as possible,
otherwise there is always going to be another place to patch.

please re-request branch approval when you have a working fix landed and
verified on the trunk. thanks.
Used original fix this time.
I filed bug 306522 for doing this the correct way.
If this is fixed on the 1.8 branch, please add the fixed1.8 keyword. Thanks.
fixed1.8, i assume.
