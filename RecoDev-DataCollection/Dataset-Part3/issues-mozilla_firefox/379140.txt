Something else I forgot to raise in my review comments: We still haven't found a solution to the problem of Application being accessible to content. I believe this shipped in a4 for the Mac, but not Windows and Linux due to bug 379139. I think we need to fix this for a5.

add privileged properties

The easiest way is to just add a new category for global properties that are chrome only. This patch adds a new category type which adds properties that can only be accessed from chrome callers. I think that's probably a better approach than any privileged caller. Not exactly sure if this is right security wise, but an attempt to access 'Application' from chrome works, whereas an attempt from elsewhere just throws 'Application is not defined'. Thoughts?
I think this is a very nice way to limit access to global properties. It certainly would work for FUEL.

Who are good reviewers?

jst, mrbkap, sicking

The patch doesn't define JAVASCRIPT_GLOBAL_PRIVILEGED_PROPERTY_CATEGORY, unless I'm missing something.

let's wait until after 1.9a5 to commit this. I need to change the FUEL tests to chrome. This patch will break the current content based tests.
moving to a6 per Mark's comment
Reassigning to Mark for the tests as mentioned above.
Actually, I'll just check this in without the fuelApplication.js change.

Good enough. I can make the small change to FUEL when I land it
Moving this to b1 for Mark's piece to land.
