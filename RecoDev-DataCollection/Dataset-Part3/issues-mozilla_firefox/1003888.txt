PanelUI.isReady() is a function that returns true if the panel has already ensured that it's ready for use.

A getter would probably be more appropriate.

Hi. I would like to start working on this bug as a part of my assignment at school. I have already downloaded and built mozilla-central. Can you please give me some more advice for this bug? Like where to find source code related to this problem? :-) Thank you.

Hey Jan! Sounds good - I'll be your mentor for this bug. Thanks for stepping up to take it!

The source code you'll need to change is in browser/components/customizableui/content/panelUI.js and browser/components/customizableui/src/CustomizeMode.jsm.

Take a look at the patch in bug 994712 - an isReady() function was added to the PanelUI object, but that functions as a getter, and should probably be a getter.

Let me know if you have any questions on how to proceed - the best way is to check "Need more information from", and then put my email address (mconley@mozilla.com) in to the text field next to the dropdown, and then Save Changes. That'll put this bug in my queue to answer the question.

Alternatively, e-mail me, or talk to me in #fx-team on irc.mozilla.org - I'm mconley.

Thanks again!

Perfect! Thanks! :D
I am little bit confused right now. Is this bug already fixed by vikneshwar as I can see in diff?
Hrm.

Yes, there appears to have been a collision here. It looks like Jan called this bug, but then vikneshwar produced a patch for it. The patch is correct, so I'm not going to r- it or obsolete it just so that Jan can repeat the work.

So I think this is mostly my fault because I didn't immediately assign this bug to Jan. :/

So thanks for the patch vikneshwar, and my sincerest apologies Jan for not immediately assigning it to you.

Jan - would you like to work on bug 1003204 instead?
Well, that's ok. No problem. :-) I didn't start working on this yet so I will start working on the bug 1003204. Thank you. :-)
vikneshwar, thanks for the patch! However, has this been run through the Try server? If it has, please post a link and re-request checkin. Otherwise, please do so :) Mike can assist you if needed.
Try push:

remote:   https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=5bdbe73f5e17

Doing just mochitest-bc, since that's the only test suite that exercises the panel in any capacity.
Just setting a reminder to check the try results.
Try run looks good. Let's pull the trigger.
