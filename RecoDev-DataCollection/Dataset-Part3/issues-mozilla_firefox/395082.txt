I'm not sure if this is the same bug as Bug 342491 or not but I get this assert:
ASSERT: null node
Stack Trace:
0:PU_nodelsFolder(null)
1:PU_getURLsForContainerNode(null)
2:PC_buildContextMenu([object XULElement])
3:buildContextMenu([object XULElement])
4:onpopupshowing([object MouseEvent])

The steps are:
1. Open the Bookmarks Manager.
2. Select a folder in the left pane.  This should result in no items being selected in the right pane.  
3. Right click in the right pane where there is no item.

this also happens on Mac and in the bookmarks sidebar.

looks good, r=sspitzer

style nit, up to you:

I prefer:

+      if (!openContainerInTabsItem.hidden && this._view.selectedNode &&
+          PlacesUtils.nodeIsContainer(this._view.selectedNode)) {

instead of:

+      if (!openContainerInTabsItem.hidden && this._view.selectedNode != null &&
+          PlacesUtils.nodeIsContainer(this._view.selectedNode)) {

hmm, those typos were part of the fix for bug #175124 which has been verified.

looking at the typos you found (good catch!), the folder-but-excluding items scenario must be broken.  

let's figure out how to test that, as it seems like you've fixed a bug that we could put into litmus.
here's what's broken that you have fixed:

before your fix, we can't right click, "open in tabs" on folders in the left hand pane of the organizer (excluding items = true).

the menu item is disabled because the existing code will throw the following exception:

ReferenceError: node is not defined

style nit addressed

requesting approval: fixes this bug and a regression from bug 175124.

But, while testing, found and confirmed bug related to "Open in all tabs": bug 437686
don't need to have a test case that explicitly checks for assertions, it's sort of assumed testers will be keeping an eye out for such things in all testing.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
