For example:

> echo { (function() { return 'foo'; })() }

Requisition._tokenize will fail due to the nested { and }.
Commonly we expect people to use the scratchpad for complex JS expressions, and to properly comprehend this issue isn't just as simple as counting the nesting levels (due to strings, regexes, comments and other dangers)

The full solution would involve uglify/narcussus or the embedded JS parser in FF.

We should consider at least detecting this problem and warning the user rather than acting bizarrely.
