Also, we'll need to alter the patch message to reflect the title of the bug.

I'm not sure where the Ci->Components.interfaces came from, but I don't think we should be doing that. Happens in several places in this file.

There's quite a bit of adding and removing blank lines. It's a bit of a nit, but unless there is a reason for it, we should avoid it, and since we're in this patch fixing the Ci/etc and the '.', we should do less LF churn IMHO.

Some of the descriptions have periods/fullstops, and some don't. So we need a standard. I vote no periods/fullstops because that's normal in menus.

Makes sense?

Agreed, removed.

Ja, alles klar

:( Can you please revert that change? My non-debug build console is getting spammed.
Nevermind, I just reverted it:

Thanks, I was hunting this down :)
addonListUnknownHeading=The following addons of the selected type are currently installed:

Not sure about this string: "selected type" and "unknownheading"? When is this label used?
pagemodRemoveAttributeRootDesc=CSS selector of root of search
pagemodRemoveElementRootDesc=CSS selector specifying root of search
pagemodReplaceRootDesc=CSS selector to root of search

pagemodRemoveElementSearchDesc=CSS selector specifying elements to remove
pagemodRemoveAttributeSearchElementsDesc=CSS selector of elements to include

Shouldn't these strings use the same structure? If the answer is yes there are probably other strings with the same problem.


Elements matched by selector: %1$S. Replaces in text nodes: %2$S. Replaces in attributes: %3$S.

Replaces->Replacements?



Restarting Firefox...
Should use single unicode character instead of "..."
