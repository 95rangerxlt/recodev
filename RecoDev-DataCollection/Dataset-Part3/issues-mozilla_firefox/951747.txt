This has already landed for non-Australis in bug 943606. This bug completes the work for Australis. Probably should have kept bug 943606 open for it, but whatever.

We're interested in collecting:

* The list of default items that are not in their default toolbars
* The list of default items that are in the palette
* The list of non-default items that are not in the palette

We'll be checking for only the built-in default and non-default items. Items supplied by add-ons will be skipped.

Can you move this comment to be located above the "toolbar-menubar" property?

You'll need to update this to include "developer-button" once bug 941002 relands. Can you file a new bug that blocks 941002 to update this?

It doesn't appear that you are worried about the ordering of these items, but maybe that would be interesting to have? If so, you'll want to track bug 951487 which may reorder these placements. It'd be great if these lists didn't have to be separate copies, as they may get out of sync with the actual placements used in CustomizableUI.
