I just stumbled upon a test that's still using the about:newtab TestRunner (meh). Getting rid of that isn't hard as the test is already async fortunately. Let's clean up some more old helper functions while we're at it.

This patch does the following:

1) Removes whenBrowserLoaded() and replaces it with promiseBrowserLoaded(). Remove whenTabRestored() and replace it with promiseTabRestored().

2) Gets rid of the about:newtab TestRunner().

3) Fixes a place that was using promiseBrowserLoaded() where it should have been waiting for promiseBrowserRestored(). Not a big difference in that specific test but certainly more correct.

4) Combines setTabState() & promiseTabRestored() calls into promiseTabState().

5) Refactores browser_819510_perwindowpb.js which invented its own TestRunner.

6) Adds forgetClosedWindows() to head.js as a helper function to forget all closed windows.

7) Removes some unused helper functions: whenBrowserUnloaded(), promiseBrowserUnloaded(), and loadPage().


I know this won't be super fun to review (sorry!) but I thought it was important to at least do a little cleanup after our tests can be so much nicer with add_task() and Promises now.

If we're touching this anyways might as well fix up the typo.
