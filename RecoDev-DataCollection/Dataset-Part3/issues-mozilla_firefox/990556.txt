Once a web page has started rendering its contents, the loading indicator on the tab becomes more or less obsolete. Seeing the page itself is the best indicator for judging whether it has loaded »enough« in order to start interacting. By showing it until the last (possibly out-of-view) bit of the page has been loaded and rendered, we are making people watch the clock and thereby hurt perceived performance.

There are two ways out of this:
1) Hide the indicator completely once the page started rendering
2) De-Emphasize the indicator once the page started rendering

Since both should require similar engineering work, it makes sense to treat them as one bug for the breakdown and then test both approaches in the wild.

For a little context, here's the analysis from where this proposal came:

As discussed with Blake, we should develop this as a telemetry experiment that runs for a week and then asks users whether or not they felt an improvement in speed.
So, the first version of this is up at http://people.mozilla.org/~bwinton/quick-load/ and I would like to close this bug.  We should, however, file follow-up/breakdown bugs to turn this prototype into an experiment, add a survey, and add a few different buckets of behaviour for people.

Does that sound reasonable, Philipp?
Yes, that sounds reasonable!
And on a first look, the new behavior works (subjectively) very well!
Okay, marking as fixed then.  Thanks!
