Please attach the install.log file located in the installation directory
ApplicationID doesn't load that dynamically. (SHCreateItemFromParsingName is only available on Vista and up.) Although from testing I seem to remember load fails on nsis add-ins didn't bork the install. You would think XP users would be screaming like crazy if this was the problem.
I suspect that the os version detection might not be working on this system similar to why there is the registry check for Vista if it reports pre Vista. But as you say, it shouldn't have bork'd the install.
Reporter, can you please attach the install.log as you requested in comment #2?
Bug 621873 makes it so we only call the plugin that uses SHCreateItemFromParsingName in the installer when on Windows 7... adding dependency.
I added code in bug 621873 so that this plugin isn't called except on Windows 7 so this should be fixed by the checkin of bug 621873
