Link to Github pull-request: https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2012

After lots of debugging and stupid mistakes, this series of patches actually fixes the Loader-related issues with the JW Player test embedding.

The first two are important, the others are just improvements to debugging stuff and asserts. So a close review of the first two would be appreciated.
Fixed by merging https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/2012. Thanks for the review.
