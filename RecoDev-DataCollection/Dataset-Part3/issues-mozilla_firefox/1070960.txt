The app template you start with in WebIDE is needlessly complex. It assumes a lot of existing knowledge, and forces someone new to go read and understand documentation, to learn all the numerous parts that are specific to that template structure. Essentially, this is a form of tech elitism.

(I'm not arguing that WebIDE shouldn't have a template like this, as it is perhaps best practice for a well designed app for someone who is familiar with everything. But it's inappropriate for getting started.)

Can you describe what a "get started" template should look like? Just 5 files (JS/CSS/HTML/icon/manifest), with the strict minimum in it?
I agree it's not the "bare minimum".  It tries to provide more structure / best practices as well.

At the very least, we may want to tweak the description to not say "bare minimum".
Some context: I started thinking about WebIDE when discussing with someone who teaches workshops similar to WebMaker, how most programming tools are needlessly complex - and are essentially built on elitism and privilege. This creates a walled garden, excluding many people.

I think a "get started" template should be something appropriate for a Hello World app, for someone who does not have existing knowledge of the specifics of WebIDE/FirefoxOS/whatever. ie, you shouldn't need to learn the unique details of a specific tool to be able to get started.

IMO, 5 files is still a lot of unneeded structure/boilerplate/whatever. I guess the icon and manifest are required? Other than that, a single HTML file is the only thing you need to get started:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello, world!
  </body>
</html>

So first, I agree, we should offer a super basic template. And we should call it "Hello, world!".

But it will have to be a little more complex than that:
- it will have to have 5 files. Because of CSP restrictions, we can't have inline code, and this is the top one failure people run into when starting an app (with invalid JSON for the manifest)
- to that, I'll add a viewport meta tag + the <link> and <script> tags
- and <meta charset="utf8"> because at least it needs to be valid HTML5

how's that?

ICON
MANIFEST (not sure what it should contain
HTML:
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
>   <head>
>     <title>My App</title>
>     <meta charset="utf8">
>     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"/>
>     <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
>     <script src="app.js"></script>
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     Hello, world!
>   </body>
> </html>
JS:
> window.onload = function() {console.log("Go!")}
CSS:
> body { border: 1p solid black; }
Sounds good! This would be a vast improvement. Maybe a short comment to mention that code needs to go in app.js, and styles in app.css? There's no indication of that being a *requirement* otherwise.

Sole, can you review this?

If you're happy with the code, can you upload it?

Also - about the icon, don't fight it. This is not negotiable.

Added a comment about CSP restrictions.
In app.js:

- Can we just use single quotes for simple strings like 'load'? (not overly concerned about this one)
- Do we want load or DOMContentLoaded? (but perhaps you don't want to introduce too many novelties here)
- Maybe you want an alert instead of a console.log if you want to get some output? In another template I use I just add stuff to body.innerHTML so it's still visible but it's not as obtrusive as an alert.
- We probably don't need 'true' when adding the listener

In index.html:

- Why user scalable = no? This creates problems to people who legitimately want to zoom in on the content.
- I usually just put the meta tag with the charset first thing before the title, as to make sure it is interpreted correctly (the browser parses it as "ASCII" until it finds a meta tag IIRC), but I'm not sure if that applies too to Gaia.
- If the MDN page is correct ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/CSP ), the "inline scripts" comment should not apply to stylesheets-it's possible to have inline stylesheets in privileged/certified apps, so the comment should be moved to be right above the <script> tag and not above the <link> tag, because it led me to doubt for a moment that CSS could be used inline or maybe considered "scripts" in CSP parlance.

In manifest.webapp:

- Do we need to make it privileged by default? they might get their app rejected in the marketplace for requesting privileges and not actually using them (not even requesting an specific permission!). I'd say if they're starting with a bare bare bones template they are doing it on purpose, and should figure out when/if they need to ask for privileges later on.

Oh apparently I don't know how to review. My previous comment is the actual review. Does it work? Sorry, sorry.

100% of our apps are not zoomable. So let's keep it that way.

Ok.

Removing the CSS file then.

I don't know about that. It's soooo annoying we can't comment a JSON file.

Double quote everywhere or simple quote everywhere. It doesn't matter.

"load" is easier to understand.

The problem with the alert on "load" is that the "ok" button is covered by the "App Installed" message. It's confusing.

Looking good!

We should probably have a mortar-github kinda project, and add a README and a license too.
But then oops, number of files++.

Right. We want to keep it light. As soon as we get Blair's feedback, let's push it to the CDN.
If I download a random thing from the internet it would be cool to know where it came from.
If I don't add a LICENSE somebody will (rightly) complain about that--it's happened already ;)

Hope Blair is OK with these required formalisms :)

That this gets downloaded seems like an implementation detail to me. Especially considering that's (rightfully) rather transparent in WebIDE (I wouldn't have known if it weren't mentioned here).

*sigh* We programmers really do like to repeatedly punch ourselves in the face, don't we?

At the very least, do we really need the full text of the Apache license? That seems massive overkill. I'd have expected a two-liner for public domain, and maybe a blurb saying something to the extent of "do whatever you want - have fun!"
Let's land that with no license. If we ever get a complaint about it, then we'll reconsider this.
Sole, for the "privileged-empty-app" template, let's change the description to "A basic localized privileged template". For this template, let's call it "hello world". Can you update the JSON on the CDN and add the right icon and sha1 to it?
So I saw that Mozilla is relicensing tests+snippets of code as public domain, and this thing is small enough that can totally be considered a snippet of code.

I think I'll just add a small note in the index.html and say "public domain - have fun!" and be done with that. I'll do that and put it into the CDN.

thanks for the feedback!

Works for me.
Just uploaded everything to the CDN, but as usual it's slow to propagate. The new template will show up... at some point.
