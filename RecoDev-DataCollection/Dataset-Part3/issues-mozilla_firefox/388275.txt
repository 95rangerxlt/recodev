We have the known bug of not displaying an error message here, like IE7 and Opera, but this messes up the menu somehow as well.

copy of feed
This breaks the UI, so it looks like a serious stability problem, even though it isn't. The fix will be low-risk, so we should take it in 2.0.0.6.
Not a 1.8 branch blocker, but if the fix is in fact low risk write one up, get it into the trunk (or is this a branch-only problem?) and we'll look at approving it.

null checks

Feeds that trigger fatal errors can still get events after the fatal error event. Make sure we check for nulls there.

null check in FeedConverter

OK, so trunk has had the patch from bug 350365 applied for a while now, which is the main fix for this.
Robert: What remains to be fixed on this?  It loads an empty feed instead of a broken one.  Should we close this as resolved?
Or is there a better workaround?
This patch landed as http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7ebd8c4e8315. As far as I can tell this is fixed, but we still have bug 350365 for a better error UI for this.
