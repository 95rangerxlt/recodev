You shouldn't have to migrate anything, customization code should gracefully handle IDs pointing to items that don't exist anymore.

I haven't adapted the toolbar sprite image for this bug. I'm not sure if we'd consider the resulting churn worth it?

Please leave this comment alone. The throbber example remains meaningful as to what kind of UI should be updated here. Whether we do or do not have a global throbber doesn't matter much for the sake of giving an example. Note that we no longer have a progress bar either.

Fix off-by-one when moving widgets

Found this trying to see if there were bits about our current code that break when the placements array contains non-existing widgets.

It looks like notloading_16.png will be unused after this patch. We can probably just remove it as well.

Out of curiousity, what happened on osx when the throbber wasn't in the busy state? From the looks of it, it seems like no list-style-image would be supplied.

Huh, seems you're right. I checked for loading_16.png, that's still used in a couple of places, so I figured this would be the same.

Correct. (on 22b, at least)

We can update Toolbar.png later when we get images for the new widgets added to it.

Hello, this bug is referring to individual cut, copy and paste buttons and you are likely referring to the unified cut/copy/paste set which are expected.
I am not seeing any cut, copy and paste buttons. Unified cut/copy/paste is there which as per the previous comment seems to be expected. So,given this state, this bug is fixed now.
