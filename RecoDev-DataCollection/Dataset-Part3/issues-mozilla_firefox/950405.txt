In-product version of bug 940660.
Do we really want to restrict this to en-US? For nightly users, showing an en-US page to non-en-US users is probably fine, and will get us feedback from a wider set of users.

Here's a patch that does limit to en-US, but I'm inclined to remove that part per comment 1.

It adds a handler for the OVERRIDE_NEW_BUILD_ID case, and then checks/sets a pref (browser.showedAustralisWhatsNew) to ensure that we only show the whatsnew page once (and not on every Nightly update). browser.showedAustralisWhatsNew will stick around in all Nightly user's profiles forever, but that shouldn't be a big deal.

Currently uses https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/29.0a1/whatsnew/ as the URL, but we can change that to whatever it needs to be.
Hi Pascal and Flod-

What do you think about showing an en-US page to all Nightly locales?  Or, what do you think of the assumption that most Nightly users will read a mozilla.org page in English?

Thx,
Jen
Note: the patch has http://, not https:// as comment 2 says, not sure if that's wanted.

What's the timing for this (when the page should be displayed, how long, how does the survey looks)? I don't like the idea of displaying English content, but that's also true that only few locales (10-15) work on trunk, and using resources to translate a one-shot page could be overdoing.
I am not a fan of showing the en-US page to locales either, people using nightly builds are our core contributors and those that choose a nightly build in their language do that on purpose, we don't advertise the localized nightly channel, that means that people using it looked for a build not in English on our ftp, it's probably because they don't want to get English content. Is there something blocking us from translating the page? Technical internationalization difficulties because of the survey? I would prefer the page to be technically localizable even if we don't have time to translate it for all the locales affected in time, at least I am confident we can do that in Italian/French/German on time. That also means that the patch shouldn't hardcode the locale code in the url btw.
Hi Pascal and Flod-

Thanks for your input.

I think I recommend just showing the page to en-US only then, because the survey is only in English and the SUMO team would like this live by Thursday, December 19 at the latest.

You can see the link to the survey here:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947433#c1

Gavin - does that work for you?

Thx,
Jen

This URL still isn't confirmed, but the rest of the patch needs review.

The intent is to land this for a little while and then back it out prior to the next Aurora merge.
The page on mozilla.org is up.

Tyler, should I just go ahead and push the patch to enable the whatsnew page?
