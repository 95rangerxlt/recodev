Hey Matt - is this a dupe of some pre-existing UITour work to e10s'ify it?
Tomasz already did the majority of the work in bug 1073238 so pages like https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/37.0a1/tour/ mostly work but there are some APIs like this one (showFirefoxAccounts) which needed more work. Also, fixing the tests (bug 1073247) will help discover more of these issues.

This can be fixed by using the `browser` variable already defined and using its loadURI method with the URL instead.

Development:
See https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/uitour/UITour.jsm?rev=fd73cdfd2009&mark=330,565-571#328 including the code starting at line 565.
* Docs on <browser>: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/browser 
* loadURI specifically: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/Method/loadURI

Testing instructions:
Test on the URL from the summary in a profile that doesn't have Firefox Sync setup. Clicking "Get started with Sync" should load the sync setup page. Test this with e10s and without to ensure it works with both. (The File menu has options to open both kinds of windows).
Note that you can omit the 2nd and 3rd arguments to loadURI

Yes. Thank you very much!

Pushed with cleanup of the contentDocument variable so others don't use it and break e10s.

Nit: For the future we don't put spaces inside function call braces.
