The patch for bug 263844 ended up causing crashes when initially landed (bug 265790), so a followup fix was pushed to tabbrowser's DOMWindowClose handler to work around it (attachment 163514).

I think that code is unnecessary now (the testcase in bug 265790 doesn't crash without it in Fennec), but we should make sure before removing it.
