I think we want a flat style for Yosemite
I like this, but the first thing that comes to my mind is - Does it really have to be that thick? I mean, isn't the current height of notification bars 31px enough?

I believe you know what I'm talking about. If the notifications are this thick (40px), they feel less like a part of the browser and the users are more likely to mistake them for a part of the website, thus often paying them no mind.
We could add an arrow pointing to the hamburger menu I guess.

Google Chrome does that, and we don't want to make Firefox look (even more) like Chrome.

No no, the problem here is simple - everything has too much height. I can understand why the buttons in about:preferences are 30px high, but this is a notification bar (a part of the browser chrome) we are talking about. We should be consistent with the rest of the browser styling.

Take the notification bar for hidden plugins ("Allow www.site.com to run 'the plugin'?"). The bar is 34px and the buttons on it are 28px. This is perfectly okay, and even though it's still more than Windows' buttons (which are 24px in height), it still looks acceptable.

However, the new Translation bar's buttons are 30px, and are flat, which doesn't correspond with the nav-bar's background gradient (at least on Windows 7). That, and the buttons on the nav-bar are 24px on hover (even though they have wider hitbox).


And this is also curious: What I'm talking about is a problem only on Windows - in a (virtual) Mac OS X the buttons are small and nice.
