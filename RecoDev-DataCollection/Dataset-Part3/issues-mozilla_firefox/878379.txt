There are two requests on the inspector, querySelector() and querySelectorAll(), that let the client find nodes without having previously seen all of its parents.  This patch changes those request to also return all nodes that the client hasn't seen that are needed to connect to the root node.

This will be used in a later patch to let the client have a real ownership tree of nodes it has seen.

Could we make the remote protocol cognisant of Sets?

Yeah, that should be doable - filed bug 880402.
I can't apply this on top of 877300 (failures in inspector.js and protocol.js), is there anything I'm missing?
