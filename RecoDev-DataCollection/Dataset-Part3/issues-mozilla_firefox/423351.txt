the UI will not be updated if only undo-ing a
cut of a few items. since the transaction count is less than
MIN_TRANSACTIONS_FOR_BATCH in nsPlacesTransactionsService, these changes are
wrapped up in a single transaction when cut/undo-ing of a single bookmark for
example. therefore there's no batching, and the front-end receives and
processes OnItemAdded before the date changes occur. we don't send
OnItemChanged for added/modified because mostly those values are changed as a
result of other changes that will send a specific notification.

the workaround is to cause the UI to reload the container (by clicking another
folder, and then returning, for example). you'll then see the restored dates.

one option might be to add aDoNotify to SetDateAdded/SetLastModified, however,
this is pretty clunky and serves only this unique case. another might be to
just get the date values directly from the bookmark service in treeView.js, but
given the quantity of UI updating in the treeview (every mouse move over the
cell, etc), that's likely going to cause performance issues.

fixed in bug 393498
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
