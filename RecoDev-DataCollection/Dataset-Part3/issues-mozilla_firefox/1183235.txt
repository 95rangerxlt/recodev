Fixed a crash.

Previously, the lifetime of mTimelineMarkers was bound to the lifetime of the nsDocShell. In this bug, that was changed to be tied to the lifetime of an ObservedDocShell, meaning they are created when recording is enabled, and destroyed when disabled. However, `nsDocShell::PopProfileTimelineMarkers` doesn't handle the latter case, and assumes an existing markers storage.

Updated the patch to handle the null case.
