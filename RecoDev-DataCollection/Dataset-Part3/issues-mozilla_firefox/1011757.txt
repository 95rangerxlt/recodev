Added aero for the icon, not the styles unfortunately.

../shared/devtools/webaudioeditor.css does not exists. You should simply use devtools/webaudioeditor.css
(or.... get rid of themes/*/devtools/webaudioeditor.css and rename themes/shared/devtools/webaudioeditor.inc.css to webaudioeditor.css and import ../shared/devtools/webaudioeditor.css in all three jar.mn and remove the * from each entry)

This should also be uplifted to aurora
The aurora (31) version of web audio editor tools are much different than this, not too sure we should worry about it as it's really rough and shouldn't be promoted

How does it matter what are the contents of the file? The aero entry is missing in aurora's jar.mn file, so this patch will just add it back.
Fair enough!
