Noticed this go by in my terminal when firing up devtools in a debug build:
{
System JS : WARNING resource://gre/modules/devtools/LayoutHelpers.jsm:18 - assignment to undeclared variable LayoutHelpers
}


Comes from this line:
> 18 this.LayoutHelpers = LayoutHelpers = function(aTopLevelWindow) {
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to declare "LayoutHelpers" with "let", presumably.

Created attachment 8480107
fix v1 (declare LayoutHelpers w/ "let", and set this.LayoutHelpers on a separate line)
