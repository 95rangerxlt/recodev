While making my own plugin I was having a problem with NSIS not seeing my DLL, so I tried to build the ApplicationID NSIS plugin to try that.

While doing this I noticed the .rc file in the ApplicationID project specifies resource1.h but it should be resource.h.

Created attachment 570423
Changed from resource1.h to resource.h to resolve build problem
