Bug 808215 added per-window private browsing support to Social, which required pre-processing of some social modules so #ifdef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING blocks could be used.  Bug 817477 removed all support for "global PB" mode, which removed all #if[n]def blocks from those modules.  Thus, there is no need to continue pre-processing these files.

Asking Ehsan for review mainly to check this is now an appropriate thing to do.
