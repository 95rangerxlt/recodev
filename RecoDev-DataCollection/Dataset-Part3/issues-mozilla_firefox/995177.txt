The fix

Currently necko_websocket.xpt doesn't get packaged on Firefox Desktop - it does on B2G & Android. This means chrome javascript can't access the websocket interface, despite the fact that the rest of the websocket code is build and shipped with Firefox.

We should just add the xpt and make it available (we found this issue where we are temporarily working around not having push notifications, by writing some stuff in javascript).
