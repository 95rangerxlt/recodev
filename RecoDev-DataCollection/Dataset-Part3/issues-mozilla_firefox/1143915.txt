With console.profile recording, we ultimately need to get additional start times from these actors, as we can have multiple recordings at once with different start/stop times.

We can have a separate "getTime" method on these actors, or can have subsequent "start" calls just return a time if its already recording (currently they bail out if already recording, so this just provides a way to get the accurate timing.)

Probably should be uplifted to Fx38.

Thoughts on uplifting this? Should we do the same for stop methods, even though we don't currently use them?

While we're at it, let's remove the `this._startTime`, since it's not used anywhere anymore.
