Steps to reproduce:

1. Select Tools/Options
2. Tab to Connection Settings button.  WindowEyes speaks "Connection. Connection Settings. O. Button.  Determine how Bon Echo connects to the Internet."  In order, this is the group box label, the button label, the button accesskey, the focused element type, and the associated text label.
3. Now tab to Choose a Feed Reader button.  WindowEyes speaks "Feed Reader.  Choose Feed Reader.  F.  Button."

Expected outcome:
WindowEyes should speak "Feed Reader.  Choose Feed Reader.  F.  Button.  Choose a Feed Reader to subscribe to web feeds with."  In other words, it should read what it's reading now, but then also read the text of the associated label.

Can we say "massive bitrot"?  See bug 340677, and sorry about that.  :-\
This is fixed on trunk already.  Is the new feeds pane being backported to branch?  if not we still need to fix this on branch.
mconnor says the prefs re-org is landing on branch, so I'm closing this bug.
for reference, bug 345516 tracks landing the new prefs on branch.
