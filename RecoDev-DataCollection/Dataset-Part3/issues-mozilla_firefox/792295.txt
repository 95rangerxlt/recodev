If a social flyout panel is open and the provider requests a new popup, the popup URL changes correctly but the yOffset does not - it remains in the same position as it is currently open at.

It all works correctly when the panel is closed and reopened at a new position, just not when already open.

Move the panel with a new panel request is made and it is already open

Update the panel position if it is already open.  Slightly more painful than it should be, but it does work.  No tests as this is very hard to write sane tests for and the behaviour is easily verified visually.

Looks ok. Ideally the panel code would handle this situation, but I'm not sure how complicated would be to fix that.

Can you make it work with getBoundingClientRect()? boxObject is supposed to not be used anymore

We should ask Neil! Really seems like we shouldn't just wallpaper over this in the front-end.
A case could probably be made that openPopup still works as normal if the popup is already opened (ie, it would just move the popup).  Best I can tell, this is prevented by http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/xul/base/src/nsXULPopupManager.cpp#1378, which declines to "open" an already open one.
http://adblockplus.org/blog/getting-screen-coordinates-for-an-html-element seems to talk about this issue a little and the code looks like it will be more complex, but I'll have a go at this tomorrow...
Only the x,y,width and height properties of boxObject are deprecated. (getBoundingClientRect should be used instead). boxObject.screenX and box.screenY are not deprecated.

Can you file a bug for fixing the core issue and add a comment in the code with a reference to the respective bug?
The intent here is that you want to move the popup but keep it anchored? I don't see from where the open method you changed in this patch is called from.

We want to keep it anchored to the same element, but with a different yOffset.

It is called by providers, via the API we inject into their sidebar, at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/social/MozSocialAPI.jsm#113.  The providers *only* supply the yOffset and we provide the anchor internally (the anchor is the sidebar itself)

TBH, I'm not sure what the "core issue" is - is it "openPopup() should not be a noop when already open but instead move the panel if necessary"?  Or maybe that a new method specifically for this use-case is needed?  Neil, what are your thoughts?

Jaws: Given the comment the box object and screenX etc is OK, are you OK with this being landed?
The core issue being comment #3 and #4. I think openPopup should move the popup to that new location regardless of it is open or not. movePopup should move relative the current location, but openPopup should be using absolute location (i hope that makes sense).

Yeah, I'm fine with landing it now.

The latter.
I filed bug 793157 for this and attached a patch.

Is there a way we can verify this is fixed? Perhaps with Shane's socialapi-demo?
