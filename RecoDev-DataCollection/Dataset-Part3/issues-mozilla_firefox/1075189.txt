No tests for this?

Hmm, I thought we did have a test (in the suite that we're working to enable in automation over in bug 899707), but I just checked, and it looks like we don't.

Marco: can you add a test for this?

In the meantime, this run should at least ensure we haven't broken anything in the browser:

There's a bug opened to add such a test (bug 1006394), I had some problems with it that may have gone away in the meantime (the transition to WebIDL may have fixed them).

Can we land this and track the addition of a test in bug 1006394?

Yes, that's reasonable, given the circumstances.

Just fyi, I had to add the bug number to the commit message to meet the commit hook requirements.
