css-tokenizer.js

The css-tokenizer.js part of the patch is rather messy,
so I thought I'd attach the complete file in case you
want to see it directly.

Review of attachment 8601631:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Tom, feels good to get rid of so much code in css-tokenizer.js
You're right, the diff is very messy, but I applied the patch locally and looked at the file in my editor anyway. The changes look great to me. I just have a few remarks about documenting the functions in this file better.
The changes in the 2 other files seem good to me too. They look enough like slight API output adjustments that I didn't spend toooo much time reviewing the details. A Try build will be much better at spotting problems with these types of changes (did you push already?).
All my local manual tests did work fine, so R+ with a green try push.

Can you add a comment for this function?

I think this comment should also say that it's advised to use the cssTokenizer function instead, and that the CSSToken offsets isn't the only reason, but also because it's a generator function so the lexing can be stop at any time, whereas cssTokenizerWithLineColumn goes over the whole string every time.

This variable isn't used.

ditto.

Not yet.  On #devtools I was advised to generally get a review before
a try push, so that's what I've been doing.

I do try to run all the relevant tests locally that I can think of before
marking them r?.

Naturally "try" pointed out that I forgot test_parseDeclarations.js.
This required a minor change to make parseDeclarations sanity-check
its input.  And, it required some test changes -- for the better, as
the parsing utilities are generally better about preserving things
as-authored at a low level now.

Carrying over r+ on account of the nature of the changes.
