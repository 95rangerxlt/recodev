When there are hidden tabs next to the current tab, moveTabBackward/moveTabForward has no effect until another visible tab is encountered.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some tabs and focus the first one
2. Move the right tab of the current tab to a new group
3. Focus the current tab itself (Ctrl+K to search bar, then Tab)
4. Ctrl+Right Arrow, no effect
5. Ctrl+Right Arrow again, it works



Expected Results:  
The hidden tabs should be skipped.

Skip hidden tabs when moving tab backward/forward
I've tried to reproduce this but i couldn't.
When in panorama, wit ctrl+right/left arrow i can scroll trough all tabs.
The same behavior on Win 7 as well.

You need to focus the tab itself first. See step 3 in comment 0 (tabs on bottom), or press F6 (tabs on top).
This still happen on the latest Nightly.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:11.0a1) Gecko/20111202 Firefox/11.0a1

Detailed steps to reproduce:

1. Start Nightly with clean profile. You'll see tabs on top,
   and there is just one tab (about:home).
2. Press Ctrl-T to open a new tab (it is the second tab).
     [about:home][about:blank(selected)]
3. Press Ctrl-T to open a new tab again (it is the third tab).
   Then, you have three tabs.
     [about:home][about:blank(1)][about:blank(2)(selected)]
4. Right-click on the second tab, and choose "Move to Group" => "New Group"
   from the context menu.
   Then, the second tab becomes hidden:
     all tabs:
       [about:home][about:blank(1)(hidden)][about:blank(2)(selected)]
     visible tabs:
       [about:home][about:blank(2)(selected)]
5. Press Ctrl-1 to switch to the first tab.
     all tabs:
       [about:home(selected)][about:blank(1)(hidden)][about:blank(2)]
     visible tabs:
       [about:home(selected)][about:blank(2)]
6. Press F6 key. Then, a focus ring appears on the first tab.
   Now the tab has focus.
     all tabs:
       [about:home(selected,focused)][about:blank(1)(hidden)][about:blank(2)]
     visible tabs:
       [about:home(selected,focused)][about:blank(2)]
7. Press Ctrl-Right(right arrow key). Then "gBrowser.moveTabForward()" is called.

Actual result:
  Nothing happens visually. The focused tab was actually moved, but
  moveTabForward() simply moved the tab to the right of the next hidden tab.
  Visual tab order doesn't change.
    all tabs:
      [about:blank(1)(hidden)][about:home(selected,focused)][about:blank(2)]
    visible tabs:
      [about:home(selected,focused)][about:blank(2)]

Expected result:
  The focused tab visually moves right of the last tab. moveTabForward() moves
  the tab to the right of the next visible tab. Visual tab order changes.
    all tabs:
      [about:blank(1)(hidden)][about:blank(2)][about:home(selected,focused)]
    visible tabs:
      [about:blank(2)][about:home(selected,focused)]
