Today, I merged mozilla-central into UX.

The good news: it mostly went well!

The bad news: it didn't all go well. In particular, the changes from bug 748894 had to be resolved manually, and I didn't do a good enough job. The merge I did ended up breaking browser.xul with invalid XML.

We need to fix this stat, and merge it into Jamun because I was too overzealous and merged it into jamun before I figured out this breakage.

No, it isn't! I read this wrongly.
Fixed in UX as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/fd26cf8fc03a

and merged into Jamun as https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/jamun/rev/fd26cf8fc03a
More bad news - there was one more fragment lost in the merge:

We're calling BookmarksMenuButton.updateStarState(); in browser-customization.js, but this was changed to BookmarksMenuButton.updateStarState(); on mozilla-central.

This means that exiting customization mode is failing (this is why tabs aren't going back into the titlebar in maximized mode, and the customization button is still disabled after exiting).

This fixes broken-ness after exiting customization mode.
