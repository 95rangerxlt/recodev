out of the blue, browser began to crash unexpectedly. i noticed that this happens usually if there is a dynamic content on that page as flash or java. the only thing which changed between "stable" and "unstable" state is that i updated Tab Mix plus extension. I tried to disable this extension, but crashes continued. Im using default theme. The crash message is:

user@computer ~/ $ firefox-bin
No running windows found
/usr/libexec/mozilla-launcher: line 119:  2794 Segmentation fault      $(type -P aoss) "$mozbin" "$@"
firefox-bin exited with non-zero status (139)

i'm using gentoo and www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.6

i have run into this problem with some java applets before as well.  If the crash is the browser not responding and eventually ending in a crash then its the same problem.  It doesn't seems like an extension incompatability problem so i wouldnt go disabling them.  Ive never ran into that problem with flash though...maybe you just need a flash update?  give us a link to a site that does this to you and we will try to help from there.
i;m sorry, but i've been away some time.. the site where firefox surely crashes is e.g. www.rozlobennimuzi.com it's site with videos(youtube-like). just roll the page from top to below and it crashes.
no crash when i visit the site http://www.rozzlobenimuzi.com/  and i went a few pages in and still no crash.  possibly there is a problem with your extensions although i highly doubt it.  if you list out your extensions i should be able to pinpoint which one is causing problems, if thats the problem.  make sure your running the latest version of firefox.  if updating doesnt fix it and the extensions arent the problem, then the only thing i can think of is a conflict with Linux.
i tried disable all extensions, but the crashes went on. but i'm begining to suspect flash library, because i found out that it always crashes if there is a flash, so java is not the place where to investigate :)
seeing as there is no crash for me it isnt a problem with firefox unless theres a conflict with linux.  unfortunately i dont know enough about linux so i cant help you there.  the only other thing i can think of is maybe your drivers?
Well, im almost sure that the part which is broken is my flash plugin, because the only sites which crash are those ones with flash. So i will wait for its new version and then will report here my results. Thank you for your help.
if you think that theres a problem with your flash plugin then go to macromedia and reinstall flash.
well, i've downgraded my flash plugin to version net-www/netscape-flash-9.0.48.0-r1 and everything's working now! solved. thank you for your help.
no problem.  always happy to help.
my firefox keeps on erroring everytime i play shockwave...once in awhile it will error while playing flash...i play Neopets and they use alot of flash and shock wave....normaly when im playing a shockwave game it either errors and closes or it just closes on its own...this is very annoying...
