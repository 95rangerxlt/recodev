Since this function isn't a constructor, and the returned object isn't a FrameWorker object, I think it makes sense to change the exported symbol's name.

I picked "getFrameWorkerHandle" because I'd chosen "WorkerHandle" in the previous patch. I'm not particularly attached to that name, though, and it is kind of ugly. Feedback desired!
