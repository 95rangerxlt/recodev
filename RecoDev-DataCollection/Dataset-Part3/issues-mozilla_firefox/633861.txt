I do not know why browser_overflowScroll.js has been disabled on linux since there is no description in that log <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/cf5f013caa80> but I guess the reason is that that test fails on linux.

I found the failure reason that scrolldown of tabbrowser on linux has "border-radius: 4px" so that the down button does not act the event in that test.

browser/themes/gnomestripe/browser/browser.css:

  1560 .tabbrowser-arrowscrollbox > .scrollbutton-down {

  1561   -moz-border-start: 2px solid transparent;

  1562   -moz-border-end: 0;

  1563   -moz-transition: 1s box-shadow ease-out;

  1564   border-radius: 4px;

  1565 }
