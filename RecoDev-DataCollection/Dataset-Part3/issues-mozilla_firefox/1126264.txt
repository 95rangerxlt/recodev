Our research has shown that users are very sympathetic towards the idea of tracking protection, as long as they have a general idea of what is happening and why.

Therefore, it is important to give some guidance once a user enables tracking protection.

Objectives of this bug:
- Decide on what information is absolutely needed when turning on TP
- Decide on the best presentation form for this information (using as little text as possible makes sense, since we know that users rarely read that stuff)

Just as a note: we'll need to do some more work on the copy here (e.g. for existing DNT users it makes sense to frame TP as an improvement of DNT). Otherwise this works great!
Mistakenly filed against Firefox 38 and should be instead 38 Branch. Sorry for the spam. dkl
