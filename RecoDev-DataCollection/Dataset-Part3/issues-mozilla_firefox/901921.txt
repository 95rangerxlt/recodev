Starting with today's nightly, the menu bar has no items in it, other than the Apple menu and the automatically created "Nightly" menu (which is empty).

Possibly related: the console.log shows several instances of

firefox: Mozilla has caught an Obj-C exception [NSInvalidArgumentException: *** -[__NSArrayM insertObject:atIndex:]: object cannot be nil]

when launching this build.

Interestingly, my local (debug) build of the same changeset does not throw these exceptions, and the menu bar looks fine.
So, weirdness. I tried to figure this one out and tried these two builds:

Broken: nightly from http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a0dd80f800e2
Working: http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/a0dd80f800e2

(yes, these are the same revisions, just on m-i vs. nightly)

I'll check m-c tinderbox (non-nightly) next. Maybe it's related to ifdef'd code?

The non-nightly version from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-central-macosx64/1375759256/ (same cset) works. The Nightly version does not. That's... bad, because we can't really bisect it very easily. :-\
I wonder if we should disable updates, given how hard this build is to use.

FWIW, these exceptions seem to be thrown when trying to paint the menu bar:

I suspect they're a -result- rather than a -cause- of the brokenness; the menubar didn't get set up correctly.

IMHO yes; this is bad juju indeed.
Same exception just "focusing" the app:

I've just tried that build and this one:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013/08/2013-08-06-03-02-03-mozilla-central/

This one is the nightly build. They both work fine for me.

Updating from the day before to today's nightly does not work.

This feels more like an update issue than a build issue.
I did a diff between an updated nightly and the raw downloaded one. It turns out that the res/ directory is missing. If I copy that from the raw nightly, then the updated one works fine again.

Blame shows this changeset as removing all of res/:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f87e93861239

which means this is a regression from bug 649607.
Bug 649607 backed out:
remote:   https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/1e381c91885d

Nightly respun :-)
Fixed in respun build: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2013-08-06-10-45-38-mozilla-central/
I got the update, but the build is still broken. Is there anything I can do short of installing from scratch?
Partial update does not fix the issue. Still missing the menu after updating with about:buildconfig showing it built from: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/1e381c91885d

Will probably need a full update to fix it for all nightly users.
*** Bug 902178 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Still not working after the update.  In fact, now even the built-in "Nightly" menu refuses to work.  

I am unable to re-open the bug, but it has not been fixed.
I filed bug 902281 to potentially force a full update on Nightly.
*** Bug 902323 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Downloading this build fixed things for me: 

https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-ux/firefox-26.0a1.en-US.mac.dmg

Funnily enough, Firefox was still really useful to me with this issue as I apparently don't really use menus. :)
One way to trigger the update that Blair posted somewhere it this: "put chrome://browser/content/aboutDialog.xul in the urlbar and hit enter."
Then click on the "update" button.
