Moving the "Tag Groups" button onto the nav toolbar marginally increases the nav toolbar's height (on Windows at least).  

Of the buttons present in the stock configuration, it seems to be the only one that does it.

Jared, this was caused by bug 956130 because the tab groups icon is now no longer part of the main set of toolbar button icons and so we increase the padding for it in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#478 .

Why was the button removed from the set of primary toolbar buttons? IMO the right solution would be to incorporate the icon in the main toolbar button set, and likewise in the menuPanel sets for display there, rather than upscaling the existing icon...
This was fixed by bug 888601.
