Please provide details about your transition plan away from the plugin to use HTML5 technologies. You can put it here in the bug or send private email to pluginwhitelist@mozilla.com.
Transition Plan:

We are currently investigating our options (HTML5 and standalone) for migration away from NPAPI, with a target timeframe of 1H 2015.  We have many customers (pay-TV operators and telcos) using the current NPAPI plug-in and it will take time for them to prepare for a migration of their subscribers.  Any guidance form Mozilla on preferred approaches would be appreciated.
The best person to coordinate with in media is Anthony Jones, the eng manager for media playback.
I have made contact with Verimatrix.
Application accepted.
This has landed in Nightly builds. Please download a nightly build from http://nightly.mozilla.org/. Using a fresh profile, verify that the plugin activates by default and shows as "Always Activate" in the Firefox addon manager.
