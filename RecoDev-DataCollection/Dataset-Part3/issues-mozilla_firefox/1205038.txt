Bug 1191242 was supposed to add the BROWSER_SET_DEFAULT_ALWAYS_CHECK histogram but it wasn't part of the Histograms.json changes that landed.

Because it is missing it is also causing the BROWSER_SET_DEFAULT_DIALOG_PROMPT_RAWCOUNT histogram to not get recorded.

The Histogram for this is,
  "BROWSER_SET_DEFAULT_ALWAYS_CHECK": {
    "expires_in_version": "never",
    "kind": "boolean",
    "releaseChannelCollection": "opt-out",
    "description": "True if the profile has `browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser` set to true."
  },

and was reviewed in bug 1191242.

To clarify for the record, this is because the getHistogramById("...ALWAYS_CHECK").add() call throws, and so the _RAWCOUNT probe is never run.

We also noticed the BROWSER_SET_DEFAULT_TIME_TO_COMPLETION_SECONDS probe wasn't being recorded. This ends up being because the |this| scope on the timer callback was wrong, and so |this._setAsDefaultTimer.cancel()| was throwing before the probe was recorded. 

That's a trivial fix with an arrow function. Seems to work now on OS X, with a workaround for bug 1205066, which is causing another exception to be thrown elsewhere :|.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 1191242 implemented this
[User impact if declined]: none, but we lose highly desired telemetry
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: n/a
[Risks and why]: low-risk, fixes two spots that are currently throwing (harmlessly, due to a catch-block, other than not recording the telemetry data)
[String/UUID change made/needed]: n/a

Bug 1191242 was uplifted to beta/41. At this point it looks like uplift/and release/41 RC builds are done, so I'm not sure if this is actually feasible to get into 41 unless there's a 41.0.1? (I probably wouldn't respin/chemspill for just this, but I'd like it to be considered for a ridealong.)

Patch v.2

During RC week, only bugs which are sec-crit + easy to exploit, severe crash/hangs and major regressions that make the release unusable are being considered. This bug does not seem to be a release blocker. Wontfix for 41.

Same as the Beta uplift comment.

We can take it in 42. Plenty of time!
