A part of pages that include Google Ads and a repeated background disappears.
The part's size is proportional to the Google Ad's size. We only see the
background of the page and when we scroll the page, the hole in the page is like
floating over the background. The only way to resolve this bug is to click on a
link (or on the tolls bar).
I've notice this bug only in Firefox (1.0.3 and 1.0.4), Mozilla 1.7 and Netscape
7.02, all for Mac OS X. The Windows' version is NOT affected. Camino (on Mac OS
X) is NOT affected. I've tried with an alpha version of DeerPark, and I've
noticed the same problem.

PS : Excuse my English I'm French! :P 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go on http://www.aecdn.org/?page=discuter or http://www.aecdn.org/?page=evenements
2.The left-top corner disappears, letting appear the background
3.Scroll down the page to see the hole "floating"

Actual Results:  
A part of the page disappears.

Expected Results:  
A page correctly displayed.
