There are two common issues uncovered by the python compare-locales version on the 1.8 branch, and we should just wallpaper around them by extending filter.py.

Firstly, we still have a few obsolete strings in other-licenses/branding/firefox/brand.properties, from the homePageMultiple stuff. Doesn't hurt anybody, let's ignore it.

The other part is a tad more tricky, en-US imports brand.dtd in browser/chrome/browser/preferences/tabs.dtd. The only reference to that file is in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/components/preferences/tabs.xul#42, which already references brand.dtd in the xul file, so not having the DTD included again doesn't cause problems.

Both are no issues on the trunk, and aren't real bugs on 1.8, so let's just wallpaper over it.

Simple fix, just intended for the branch so that we can use current tools on old trees.

     # we only have exceptions for browser and extensions/spellcheck
+    # and other-licenses/branding/firefox

nit: that comment reads funny with two 'and's

Requesting approval to land the tooling fix on the 1.8 branch. NPOB, but part of the reporting infrastructure.

Approved for 1.8.1.15, a=dveditz for release-drivers

But we're not likely to actually wait for this one to tag the tree, so land ASAP.
Checked in, thanks.
