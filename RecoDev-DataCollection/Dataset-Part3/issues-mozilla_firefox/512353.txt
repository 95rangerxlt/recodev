When I open Minefield with a new profile (with the default three bookmarks in the toolbar), the chevron appears at the right side.  When I click it nothing happens.  Doesn't occur on 3.6.
So this is probably regression from bug 382466, the only thing that can cause the chevron to appear is an overflow event on the scrollbox that is containing items (a pinstripe problem?). I tested the patch on Mac but it was not causing this, could be still that some last minute change broken that.
So, looking  at this with Drew, looks like it just happens witha new profile, but as soon as you add any bookmark and restart browser, then everything works like expected.
There might be a vertical overflow. event.detail will expose that.
sure, that's a really plausible cause, could be on pinstripe the bar has nota min height, so we overflow vertically.
Drew can you try patching the toolbar.xml code to ignore overflow/underflow events if they are vertical overflow? I can't test on Mac from here.

This ignores overflows that are purely vertical (detail == 0).  As Marco says, it's conceptually correct, but combined horizontal-vertical overflows (detail == 2) sometimes occur when it seems like they shouldn't.  e.g., with a new profile, hide the nav bar and restart.  A detail == 2 overflow occurs, quickly followed by an underflow.  With this patch, that makes the chevron briefly appear until the underflow occurs.

right patch this time...
both winstripe and gnomestripe define
#PersonalToolbar {
  min-height: 26px;
}
probably the value is wrong in pinstripe, but could you check if adding a min-height changes anthing about that flickering issue?
Well, setting min-height does indeed get rid of the vertical portion of the combined overflow; now there's only a horizontal overflow. :\
the previous implementation had a min-width:1px, uncommented and apprently useless. could be that was needed for mac... so i'd say to try with that too.
I don't think the min-width would make a difference.
We should probably both take the min-height and ignore vertical overflow events.
Dao, that is fine, but we get an useless horizontal overflow that is still causing the useless chevron. See comment 8.
That's fine, as long as we get an underflow event as well.
we do, but we also get a Ts hit when that happens, because we apply a Places result to the chevron, that we don't need to. So if we can avoid that, we should do it.
I don't think a min-width will solve this. Maybe the Places result should only be applied when the chevron is clicked? Otherwise you get the same Ts hit when bookmarks actually overflow the toolbar.
Also, I suggest handling this in a separate bug.
it's applied on view, opened (queried) on popup opening. Yeah we could even apply it on first use i guess, but that would be a Tsnappiness issue than (minor one since it's mostly an if check).
Even if we cannot be sure about min-width, worth a try, if it just works won't be a problem having it. will take just 2s to try.
well i merely tried in a vm, so i could be wrong, i admit. Btw, adding a min-width: 1px completely solved the problem here. i  added it to as a scrollbox style, but actually could be that adding it to the personalToolbar style could be enough.
So please, someone on a real Mac, test that :)
The horizontal overflow is Mac-only? If so, why?
dunno, but if we can workaround it for now, i'd take a patch for that with a clear comment on why we are doing it and followup bug ref, and file a followup to discover why happens on Mac.

Drew, could you please try this patch (is intended also to fix bug 515106 and another drop glitch i found about dropping between buttons)

I don't see a chevron flickering but i'm unsure about testing that, since this patch does not have any min-width set.

vertical underflows should probably ignored as well.

Why that? Wasn't the code expected to deal with that? The indicator looks properly aligned to me without that margin.

This looks wrong. The min-height should be all what's needed to fix bug 515106.

doesn't make a difference, in underflow we just collpase the chevron, if it's already collapsed nothing will happen. If you want that just for completeness no problem.

Yes but it's flickering on first drop on OS X, all buttons move right by half of the indicator, then they move back, but we uncollapse only after moving the indicator. Can't say why offhand, the code deals with the margin doing the same thing, i'm just adding the initial value consistent with code.

This is to fix another problem, actually when you drag on the empty part of the toolbar it consider that as a drop at the end of the toolbar, the problem is that pinstripe adds a 1px margin between buttons, that mens while you drag over this small 2px part, the drop indicator flickers between the right position and the end of the toolbar.

If it's not collapsed yet, it will be collapsed incorrectly.
hm, i'm not sure when we could receive a spurious vertical underflow without a spurious vertical overflow... Btw, adding that ignore to underflow is just a minor thing, we can do that for code consistency, without hitting any issue.
The chevron actually disappeared from my bookmarks toolbar yesterday and never showed up again during that session, although I'm not sure it was caused by this.
assigning, per comparison with an old nightly the correct min-height must be 23px.
I still have to test the overflow/underflow flickering issue.

sounds like the min-height got rid of all spurious overflows.
I'm unable to reproduce the flicker, i tried with new profiles, old profiles, windowed or fullscreen. if they will still be reproduceable after this, we will need some more STRs.

i got rid of the start-margin changes, i'm unable to reproduce the flickers above atm, so no need to add something that i'm unsure fixes anything.

I think the min-height belongs to #personal-bookmarks, since the item can be moved to a different toolbar. (The correct value will be 21px there, but you should test this yourself.)

> toolbarbutton.bookmark-item {
>   font-weight: bold;

This makes the first item touch the toolbar border. Could be fixed by adding -moz-margin-start:1px to #personal-bookmarks.

>+  padding: 0 1px;

This should remain padding:0, I think. -moz-padding-start overrides part of it anyway:

>   -moz-padding-start: 7px;

*I think* the correct value will be 21px there. But as I said, please test this yourself.

sorry for late, i was recompiling on other platforms, i compared the heights on all three platforms with 3.5.3. On gnomestripe the min-height was low, was probably copied over from winstripe, notice this change does not increase the size.

afaict, everything looks fine

Note that the bottom padding was 1px larger than the top padding...

Since you removed the paddings, this needs to be margin: 0 0 1px; in order to align the buttons properly.

Windows looks good, still need to test Linux.
i'll compare labels v-positions on Mac then to ensure they are fine
