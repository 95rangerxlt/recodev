Right, LZMA support is going to be a requirement soon-ish.

Alon, does your lzma.js support streaming decoding? As in, we pass in an incomplete chunk of the file, the decoder parses until data is exhausted, stores state and resumes as soon as new data becomes available? If so, I think it'd be our best bet.
I'm afraid you probably don't want lzma.js because it's a port of lzip, which is GPL licensed. But also, it is a commandline tool, so I'm not sure it supports streaming, although the headers do have some methods to process chunks (not sure if that's what you need or not).

I ported lzip because it's the smallest standalone LZMA implementation I could find. But performance turned out to be not very good, due to heavy use of 64-bit ints. Not sure if other implementations have the same issue or not.

Better options might include

The game still doesn't work, but this particular issue is fixed.
