It seems like iFrames get associated to the WebConsole that is opened in the current selected tab and not the WebConsole of the parentWindow the iFrames is added to.

Testcase:

Open the WebConsole on http://www.heise.de/ and on another page. Reload heise.de and switch over to the other tab with opened WebConsole. You will see network logging of iFrames of the heise.de page in the false/other WebConsole.

Patch:

The patch enclosed checks if the initialized window is an iFrames. If that's try the top most parent window is queried and the hudId is looked up by looking up the hudid associated with the parentWindow.

proposed patch

Proposed fix. The previous patch was correct in its intent on how to fix the issue, but there were some bugs which caused the entire WebConsole to fail during windowInitialize() - I think Julian did not have sufficient time to test the patch.

In this patch I've corrected the fix for the windowInitializer method, and I have also included an automatic test for the problem.
