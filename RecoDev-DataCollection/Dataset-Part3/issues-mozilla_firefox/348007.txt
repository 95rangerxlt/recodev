Ginn, is -1 a legal index to pass in, which means get last child?

If so, I think this code should live in refChildCB, because then all the GetChildAt() implementations would benefit.

Note: we don't say this is a legal index in nsIAccessible.
I think it's illegal.
I'm fine if we check it in refChildCB.

note: this patch was taken from nsAccessible::GetChildAt.

And this bug is a potential issue for Firefox on Gnome new builds, this didn't happen just because of a bug of atk-bridge. (gnome bugzilla 350552, http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=350552)

I think we should also fix this for 18branch and 180branch.

I think it will be safer to patch nsAppRootAccessible.cpp, too.

I recall this comment, the possibility is quite low.
I didn't find a testcase without modify mozilla code.

forgot to close it.
