Catalin, did you restart the browser after step 2?  (iirc, it is required to make the config change stick)
I've tried again using the latest FF 42 Nightly and I've restarted the browser after step 2, the bug is still reproducible.
Can you try disabling the sandbox by setting security.sandbox.content.level to 0
I'll wait to respond until after Catalin answers comment #3.
The bug is not reproducible when security.sandbox.content.level is set to 0 .
I have some more questions for you, Catalin:

Does the bug happen with a clean profile (save for the change you made in your step 1)?

Is the bug a recent regression?  For example, does it also happen with FF 39, FF 40 beta and current Developer Edition nightlies (with clean profiles)?

What directory is displayed in about:sync-log?

Oops, sorry.  I forgot this bug only happens in e10s mode, with the
content sandbox on.  Do test in a current Developer Edition nightly,
though, with e10s on.
(In reply to Steven Michaud [:smichaud] from comment #6)

> What directory is displayed in about:sync-log?

sync logs are in the profile under: /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<salted profile>/weave/

Is that inaccessible when running sandboxed?
> Is that inaccessible when running sandboxed?

I don't believe so.  But the relevant sandbox rules are very complex, and it's possible I'm reading them wrong.

In any case, I want to get as much information as I can before I start digging into this.
The bug is not reproducible on the latest FF 41 DevEdition with e10s enabled, the bug is reproducible using 
a new profile and the latest FF 42 Nightly build id:20150716030208 .

The directory displayed under about:sync-log is:

///Users/svuser/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/7ybfeu28.73/weave/logs
I can reproduce this bug with yesterday's m-c nightly.  (For some reason there isn't any Mac m-c nightly for today.)

Oddly, the browser has no problem *writing* sync logs -- only reading them.  I suspect they're written by the main/chrome process, but read by the content process.  That isn't ideal -- all file access should (ultimately) be brokered through the chrome process.

But in the meantime we do need to fix our content process sandbox rules.

I wasn't able to reproduce this bug in yesterday's Developer Edition.  The reason, it seems, is that the content process sandbox is either missing or off in the Developer Edition.

This is a minimal patch -- it fixes just this bug as reported.

I figure anything more ambitious should wait until we've proxied as much file access as we can through the main/chrome process.

Yes, that's the only way we can work around such issues for now.
Looks fine to me.

Seems like a simple change, let's uplift to Aurora.
Catalin, could you please verify this fix on the latest Nightly build? Thanks.
