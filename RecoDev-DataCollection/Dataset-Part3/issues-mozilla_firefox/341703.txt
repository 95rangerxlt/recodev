Firefox locks up and stops responding while it is loading a page, and I try to change to a different page, or application.

I have reinstalled twice, both having the same issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox, and go to yahoo.com.
2. While yahoo.com is loading, tried to go to cnn.com OR/AND opening windows media player 10.
3. firefox stops responding.

Actual Results:  
Locks up, and no longer responds.  I have to close firefox using windows task manager.

Expected Results:  
Simply gone to the other site, or allowed WMP10 to have screen priority.

This bug seems to have been fixed as of the latest version for me.

Thanks
