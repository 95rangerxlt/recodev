When building with --disable-places, chrome://browser/content/places/placesOverlay.xul doesn't exist, so the overlay fails.

(Building with that fixed to see if it does anything else to my build... :/ )

Oh, if --disable-places isn't going to be supported, might want to consider telling me in configure ;)

Manually editing browser.jar got everything to work again, still building in case I screwed up.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
