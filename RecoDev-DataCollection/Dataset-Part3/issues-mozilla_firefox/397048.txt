Do you know why the tinderbox do not have this problem ? They're building on Win 2k3 using VS 8 SP1.
I would guess it's busted for static/non-libxul - tinderboxes are getting it from http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/library/Makefile.in#230 and -enable-static doesn't get into /toolkit/library/, does it?

I think so.

Drivers: essentially no risk, since it's in an #ifdef that official builds don't hit.
browser/app/Makefile.in: 1.137
Please see bug 397388.  It seems to be the same problem, for Seamonkey.
