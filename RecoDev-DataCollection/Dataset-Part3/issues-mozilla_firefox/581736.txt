Not sure what .visibleTabs should report, but showOnlyTheseTabs should probably skip over app tabs?

Don't hide app tabs but this will cause strange reorderings for now. 

Seems like app tabs will keep reordering among themselves when you switch to an app tab.. perhaps because of showOnlyTheseTabs is triggering to switch the active group if you switch to a different group's app tab.
