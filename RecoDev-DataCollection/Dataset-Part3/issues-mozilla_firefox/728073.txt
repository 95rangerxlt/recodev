Example of a MDN link in the Style Inspector

MDN links in the Style Inspector (see the attached screenshot) point out to English pages, even if my system is in French and that corresponding French pages are available on the MDN website. For example, we see in the attached screenshot a link for the "background-color" property. This link points out to the following page:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/background-color

even if a French translation is available:

https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/CSS/background-color

We should be pointed out in the system-language page (if available) before the English one.

Internally, we just need to remove the `en` from the URL:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleinspector/CssHtmlTree.jsm#740

MDN will automatically redirect to the right page.
