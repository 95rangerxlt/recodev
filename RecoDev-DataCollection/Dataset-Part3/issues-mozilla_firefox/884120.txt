When entering customization mode without a lightweight theme applied, LightweightThemeListener.observe dereferences themeData even if "null" was passed as aData.

We should only disable lightweight themes if one is applied when entering customization mode, since this looks like it may break consumers unexpectedly.

No, consumers have to expect null being passed in. This is a bug in 
LightweightThemeListener.
My fault so I can take this eventually.

Unclear if this actually breaks something.

nullcheck themeData before using it in LightweightThemeListener

This was annoying me, so I looked... I think this is all we need here?

Are you sure you can't just return if !aData?

As discussed on IRC, aData is 'null' in this case because of JSON.stringify being called on null so this is fine.

Nit: we generally prefer early returns:
  if (!themeData)
    return;
Pushed with nits fixed:
