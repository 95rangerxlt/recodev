After installing the 2005-04-06 build of Firefox 1.0+ on MacOS 10.3.8 (upgraded
from 1.0) to get rid of the JS buffer exploit, the browser will hang and/or
crash after opening/closing the About Firefox dialog box from the Firefox menu.

This has happened on 3 different machines, each with few or no extensions installed.

I'm sorry if this is a duplicate; my search returned nothing like this for
Firefox, though there's an off chance it might be related to bug 273227 (Sunbird)?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "About Firefox" dialog
2. Close said dialog

Actual Results:  
Firefox hangs, requiring a "Force Quit" -OR- immediately crashes (unexpectedly
quit, says Apple).

Expected Results:  
Firefox should remain functional and responsive.

1.0.3 is the branch, you've reported this against a trunk build

> 1.0.3 is the branch, you've reported this against a trunk build

This is using the build from the latest-trunk/ directory.  I'm not using 1.0.3
AFAIK; if I'm mistaken I apologize.  Additionally, this problem was introduced
AFTER the 2005-04-04 build, where I don't encounter the erroneous behavior.

There's an additional bug in 2005-04-06 where there are NO scroll bars, but I'll
have to file that as a different bug.
right, so why have you asked for blocking1.0.3?
I realized you were referencing the blocking flag shortly after posting.
Brain-fart.  Sorry.

No problems here on Win32.  As to the 'other bug', it's already been reported
and fixed, you can find more information on bug 289248 and bug 286000.

Stack trace for crash on closing About box

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050407
Firefox/1.0+

I have been seeing this stack since 2005-04-06 14:03. The crash occurs 
when closing the About box, and possibly at other times.
wee, seeing this on 20050406 too, what has regressed this?
Based on the stack, looks like the same basic issue as bug 289379
this is also a problem with Thunderbird on Mac.

(not a problem on Linux, either.)
plussing as this is a no brainer. 
*** Bug 289791 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Please retest in tomorrow's builds now that bug 289379 has been fixed?
WFM in 20050412 bits.
Confirm fixed w/ trunk nightly 20040412, MacOS 10.3.8
make that 20050412, just for clarity's sake
sorry for the typo (& bugspam)
Shouldn't this be resolved WFM, not Fixed, since there is no patch on this bug?
 The on it depends on was the one fixed...

1. I've lurked for a while, and read as many docs as I could, regarding
Mozilla's use of Bugzilla.  In the grand scheme of things, I'm new at this, so
if there are additional guidelines I'm missing do feel free to drop me an e-mail
and lend me a clue. :-)  I've been going slowly, trying not to make too much of
a pain of myself... hopefully.

2. The Bugzilla help says to mark FIXED if a patch was checked in that fixes
this problem; it doesn't say that the patch _must_ be attached to this bug entry.

3. The same document says WFM is for bugs that were unreproducible, etc., which
was certainly not the case here.

4. I marked RESOLVED FIXED as it seemed appropriate to do; waiting for
additional confirmation before marking VERIFIED.  If there's anything different
or in addition that I should do to put this bug to rest, again, let me know.


William, FIXED is definitely the right resolution, since you know exactly which
patch fixed it.
