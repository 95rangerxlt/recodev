There is a dialog in Firefox that triggers on this Unicode Chart page because
the script is running for so long. It says:

   A script on this page is causing mozilla to run slowly. If it continues
   to run, your computer may become unresponsive.

   Do you want to abort the script?

                                              [  Cancel  ]   [   OK   ]

where "Cancel" means "Abort the script" and "OK" means "Continue running the
script".

The buttons should be labeled "Abort" and "Continue", respectively.

mpt suggests:
  1. Changing "abort" to "stop"
  2. Naming the buttons "Stop Script" and "Continue"
This is fixed in trunk, no? (bug 145523).
Yep. Sorry.
