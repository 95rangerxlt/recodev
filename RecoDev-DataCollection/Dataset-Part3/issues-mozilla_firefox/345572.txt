Options window
I'm actually seeing this on Linux, too, believe it or not. Either the height or width of the dialog needs to be made larger.

adding regression since this is new (as of the options dialog rewrite)

it doesn't block FF2b2, but would be nice to fix.

(I'm hoping beltzner / mconnor / ben agree)
I suppose that this is the same (or at least a similar) issue which also causes the Profile Manager to look slightly skewed: we display two lines of text but during the layout the frame claims to be only one line high and it doesn't trigger a reflow when it becomes obvious that that one line isn't enough.

Cheap work-arounds: shorten the checkbox's label or add an explicit style="height: 5ex;" to the checkbox (from a l10n perspective the latter is better, although even two lines might not be enough for some languages).

using the "height: 5ex;" style rule for the checkbox, per simon

is there a bug on that?

thanks for the suggestion, simon.  

Using the dom inspector, I confirmed that your work around fixes the problem.

Bug 343964 and/or bug 321984 (depending on which gets duped). There's probably more.

Nit: em measures the width, ex the height of a character. Your patch might break for fonts with an extreme width/height proportion. Rather use the proposed 5ex (2ex per line and 1ex per line spacing - although that might be slightly off as well).
Blocking, let's get in on trunk and an a? on it ASAP, please.

Incorrect.  See CSS2.1 section 4.3.2; the em unit's equal to the computed value of the font-size property of the element or its parent, depending on context, and it may be used for vertical or horizontal measurement.

Patch checked in on trunk, with the request for branch approval in a sec...

I don't see that, but the missing space at the bottom seems to have got worse:

especially since bug 346044 landed on branch.

The cropping issue fixes with the default XP theme, but I also don't see the missing line:

seems to be system font size(family) issue.

[XP default theme]
standard font size http://img106.imageshack.us/img106/830/xpstdje5.jpg
large font size http://img114.imageshack.us/img114/8373/xplargedm5.jpg

can this be fixed?
We break with non-default font families/sizes. We always have and probably always will. So what we do is tailor the options dialog to best fit the default font size/family. See the bug Ria mentioned in comment 18. 

The issue you're seeing is beyond the scope of this bug, so please stop commenting.
verfied with Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP SP2 and standard font families/sizes with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060829 BonEcho/2.0b2


Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060828 BonEcho/2.0b2

Looks good on Linux, too.
Note, this fix causes some ugly side effects, in some themes where there is a border around the checkbox. See the screenshot I'll attach.

In Nautipolis theme, the check for default buttons is too large...

Note, this is caused by an hardcoded 'height:3em' in:
/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/main.dtd, line 44 -- <!ENTITY alwaysCheckDefault.height "3em">
Please file a new bug for that issue.
