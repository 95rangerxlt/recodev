More  details from Youtube investigation  - 
The extension "Download Flash and Video" or alternately "Flash and Video Download" (not be confused with "Flash Video Downloader") has several points in it's code where it looks for the video id, but determines it's the video id with var.indexOf("video_id") != -1, so if "video_id" is anywhere in the string it assumes it's the id. Notably, annotations and related playlists both contain "video_id". The code then takes the id, appends it to "watch?v=" and requests it every 4 seconds until it's successful.


Expected results:

No spam requests.

The developer has been informed about this bug.
