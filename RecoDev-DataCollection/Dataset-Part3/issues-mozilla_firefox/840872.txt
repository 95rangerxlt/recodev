There are a number of cases when we silently refuse to open a chat, including that the chat URL is not of the same origin and when a user is not logged in.  We should Cu.reportError() in those cases so the provider has some clue as to why the request failed.

is it worth mentioning that this might be because there must be a logged in user for it to be available? not sure
I didn't change the message to reflect the user might not be logged in as we have another bug on file to remove that restriction, at which time this message will probably have been forgotten and therefore wrong.

Should this get a test?

Nah, I don't think it is necessary.
Is there anything worth QA verification here?

Nope - it's really just diagnostics for people actively developing a provider - it should be impossible for you to see with any existing providers.  I can't remember what flag this implies I should add though :)
