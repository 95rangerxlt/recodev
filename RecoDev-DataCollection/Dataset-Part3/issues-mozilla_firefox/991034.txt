"the following strings are unused in Australis, they're kept here to avoid warnings from l10n tools like compare-locales on l10n-central. They will be definitely removed when Australis is ready for mozilla-aurora."

Australis is on mozilla-beta now.

I'll file a bug so we detect the missing strings sooner (and in a more clear manner).

Bug 992316

Probably "again" rather than "still"...
