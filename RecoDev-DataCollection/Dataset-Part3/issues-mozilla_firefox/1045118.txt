Various devtools Makefile.in's have |libs::| rules for installing .js and .jsm
files.  The recent work in bug 1044162 has eliminated the need for those
rules.  Let's remove them.

move install rules in browser/devtools/*/Makefile.in to moz.build

Move everything to EXTRA_JS_MODULES.  We need to be careful in projecteditor/
because INSTALL_TARGETS_FILES will happily install directories, not just
files.  I admit that the new hotness here is...well, not all that hot.

The comments in projecteditor's Makefile.in appears to be sorely out of date,
so I have removed them as a casualty of this conversion.

(This patch needs bug 1044162's patches to be applied, if the dependency isn't
going to make that obvious.)

Yeah, it would be nice if we could wildcard some of this stuff. Everything here looks fine for now though, but again I seem to be having trouble getting all these patches applied so this was just a manual review :(
This landed: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d5718ab53065

I guess mcMerge missed this.
