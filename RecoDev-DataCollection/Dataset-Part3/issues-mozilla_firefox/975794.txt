Patch 1

I think it would make more sense to update http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/31113754db3b/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#l474 to only affect buttons in a toolbar.

Unfortunate descendent selector, but I see no better choice.
Thanks for fixing this!

Why not use [cui-areatype="toolbar"]:not(.overflowedItem) ? This is how we've tended to solve this elsewhere...
Thanks for the patch! Can you please update it with commit information and re-request checkin? :)

Because the cui-areatype isn't set on toolbarbuttons in a toolbaritem, for instance.

When combined with .toolbarbutton-1, that would be a bug.
Need an updated patch before this can land, per comment 7. Unless someone else wants to fix & land it.
