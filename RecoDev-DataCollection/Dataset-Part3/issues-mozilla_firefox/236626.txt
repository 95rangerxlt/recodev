The 'transparent' background around a favicon in a tab has the wrong background
color when the tab is not being hovered.  Upon hovering (but still keeping tab
in background), the transparency around the favicon is normal.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open three tabs.
2. Hover the mouse over one of the background tabs.
3. Look at area around tab favicons
Actual Results:  
Notice how the background around the favicon in the hovered tab matches the rest
of the tab background.  Compare to the non-hovered background tab, where the
color around the favicon doesn't match the tab background.  This happens with
the default favicon (little globe) or a real favicon.


Expected Results:  
The favicon background should match the rest of the tab background, regardless
of whether you're hovering over the tab or not.

Screenshot showing tabs and their favicons.  Look at the differences in the
background around the favicon for tab 2 vs tabs 3 and 4.
