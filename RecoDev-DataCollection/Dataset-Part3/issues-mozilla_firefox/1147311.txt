Bug 756022 narrowed the permissible value space for the font.language.group pref which tracks the currently-chosen group in the font settings, but the patches didn't deal with font.language.group being left with an obsolete value.

BG__migrateUI() in nsBrowserGlue.js should be amended to check the value of font.language.group and, if the value is "tr", "x-baltic" or "x-central-euro", set the value to "x-western".

I was hoping this was upliftable to Aurora and Beta, since problem this patch addresses was introduced in Firefox 34. I guess fx-team taking 28 in the mean time makes uplifting too much trouble. :-( Or is there a good solution?

the only solution would be to move migration 28 to migration 30 (it will run again but should not be an issue) in Nightly.
