I think it's fare to ask you to review & land this given that you broke it ;)

Review of attachment 8416252:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm tempted to r+ this patch as is, but I'm confused about the need for the async stuff in head_dbg.js. Please clarify :-)

For consistency, I'd prefer it if we used an absolute path here, as we do for all the other requires.

"async function"

Is errorback a thing now? That's horrible :)

Why is this necessary? We don't seem to be using it anywhere.

This is probably misleading. Doesn't assert take a message as its second argument? do_check_true doesn't.

Ok I have updated patch to address comments, it also looks like in previous patch I forgot to include actual test file which is probably part of why things were not clear.

I've added async utils to make test definition clear & free of callbacks as I find it a lot more easy to maintain.

Can you please land this if this looks good.

Thanks
