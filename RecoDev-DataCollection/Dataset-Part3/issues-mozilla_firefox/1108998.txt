I've updated the development server with fixes for this.  You can test by changing the preference social.shareDirectory to https://activations.paas.allizom.org/sharePanel.html
Sorry, my comment was for bug 1108995
I'm actually not clear on the STR for this bug.

So my share panel on beta has a [+] in the strip on the left side, with the tooltip "Find More Share Services..." and a facebook logo. I don't know how the facebook logo got there, but it has no tooltip and no other accessibility-usable label. Does that help?

At least on aurora, I have a tooltip that has both the name and the base url of the provider.  Unless you've activated Facebook, there is no way that it would be an option in the list.

Using a clean profile with the latest nightly download, I have to move the share icon to the toolbar, open it, and click on facebook to get it to appear.  I see the tooltip.

Can you show me your social.* prefs ?

Sorry, my description was from memory and inaccurate. It does have a tooltip, but it's done using a tooltip attribute which points to a tooltip element, which presumably gets populated with the relevant data onpopupshowing. Our accessibility API can't deal with that (not least because under normal a11y usage, the popup might never be shown "over" a specific node).

The working node has a tooltiptext attribute which just has the right data.
added a label on the buttons and pushed to try

not sure of best way to test on osx.   Marco, can you look at the builds once they are available?

I will try the build on Windows once it becomes available, but in the meantime, not even aria-labelledby would help here because if the tooltip element only gets populated on a certain action, the data won't be available, or it will, depending on randomness of the mouse pointer sitting somewhere. Since a blind user never uses the mouse, the approach taken in the try build might be the right way (haven't seen the patch yet, though).
Can confirm that the button is now labeled. Its label says "Facebook Share".
