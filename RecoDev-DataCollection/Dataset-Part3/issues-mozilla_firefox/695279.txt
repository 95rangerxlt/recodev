The debugger UI must be properly internationalized like the rest of the developer tools. GCLI might be a good inspiration as it is also HTML-based. The proper location of the text files will be determined in accordance to bug 687851.

This bug required another fx-team merge, in order to get the new l10n bits:

WIP

Converted everything but the iframe to get strings from resource files. This will need to be converted to xhtml AFAICT and I'll get to it next.
In bug 700036 we started moving our xhtml/html documents to xul-documents-with-html-as-the-default-namespace.  This helps solve a few things (such as ltr).

This is an interesting data point in our html vs. xul discussion. However, I propose we deal with that issue in a followup, in order to move quickly towards merging with m-c. If the debugger does indeed suffer from the same bug, I think it would be easier to get people like Ehsan to verify it using a nightly, rather than getting them to build remote-debug. Doing work in smaller chunks will also help with our growing patch queue and the merge conflicts we're encountering with Victor.

That followup could be bug 700639.

Can we drop this alert entirely?

Yes, there is another one as well a few lines below. I've been meaning to take care of them after I update this part to use a fresh version from the Source Editor, after it lands. In fact I wanted to file a bug to extract these functions into a utility module. I'll convert them to Cu.reportError for now.

I'll do it as part of bug 700351, in order to avoid rebasing the rest of the patches in the queue, and the modularization patch in particular.
