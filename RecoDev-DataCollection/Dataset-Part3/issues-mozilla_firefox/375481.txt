[places] unable to dnd bookmarks to the personal toolbar

I'm using my own Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a4pre) Gecko/20070326 Minefield/3.0a4pre.

when I dnd the favicon from the url bar, the "I" shappend drop cursor stays after I drop (but the bookmark is not added)

when I dnd from a link in the page, the cursor does not persist after I drop, but the bookmark isn't added, either.

the last thing in the console is:

*** PlacesCreateItemTransaction(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?produ
ct=Firefox, 4, -1)

in the error console, I see 

Error: TYPE_X_MOZ_URL is not defined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/places/utils.js
Line: 662

hmm, that should be this.TYPE_X_MOZ_URL maybe?

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
