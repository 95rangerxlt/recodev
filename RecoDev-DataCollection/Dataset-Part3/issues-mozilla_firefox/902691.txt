Bug 846918 landed before we started adding the "Learn More" link to security related warning messages. We need to write a MDN page that provides more information about Strict Transport Security and link to it from the warning message. 

This should be as easy as adding a new logical branch in addMoreInfoLink in browser/devtools/webconsole/webconsole.js and reusing some of the content for these blogposts: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/12/26/http-strict-transport-security-2/
https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/

or reusing and perhaps adding more content to this mdn page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security

Please remove the /en-US/ part to allow MDN to redirect the user to the page that best fits user's regional settings.

nit: this function is growing now. Wouldn't it make sense to change these ifs into a switch block with cases for aScriptError.category? should be easier to follow...

Once 875456 lands, I will change the if block to switch statements and also replace all of the learn more links to use the non-region specific links. Thanks for pointing those out.

As part of this bug, shouldn't we update https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security to include a section that clearly explains the webconsole error/warning and provides guidance on how to fix the issue?

I think that's a good idea. We can probably add a section about web console messages and describe common causes.

Another strategy could be to have pages dedicated to being the destinations of embedded "learn more" links that would have short descriptions, but heavily link to other pages of MDN.
You may want to discuss with the MDN team for a convention that would allow tracking of when people go to MDN from the console. Something like ?from=console at the end of URLs.
Anyway, happy to discuss linking and page organisation strategy at https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc
