If a stylesheet is added to the injectedStylesheet array but is not present in the preferences.xul file, the openAndLoadSubDialog() helper function will fail when making sure that all injected stylesheets are found.

This is because the function is currently looking at content.document.styleSheets, but it should instead be looking at content.gSubDialog._frame.contentDocument.styleSheets.

Since the frame is already loaded in this case (we're in the load listener) this should be fine. Thanks
