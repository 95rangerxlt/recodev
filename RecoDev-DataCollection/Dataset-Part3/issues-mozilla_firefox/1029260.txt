Story:

As a product owner, I want to assess user satisfaction with a variety of default search providers so that I can prioritize future product offerings.  


Acceptance Criteria:

*I can change the default search provider setting for a subset of users on the EN-US Beta channel.  

*These users can change their default search provider at any point after we change their default to any other search provider that Firefox supports

*12 weeks after we make the change to the default search provider, we will end the test and change the user’s default search engine to what it was before we changed the default.

*Users have the ability to opt-out of the test if they want to

What's the intended behavior at the end of the experiment, if the user changed their default search provider during the experiment period? Keep their new option, or reset to what it was originally?
