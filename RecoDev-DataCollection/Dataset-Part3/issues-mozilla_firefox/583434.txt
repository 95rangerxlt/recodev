When giving a name to a tab group, it's impossible to deselect the name so that typing doesn't automatically replace the current name.

Normally in a text box/area, when you select text with the mouse or shift key, using the arrow or clicking outside the selected text deselects the text.

However there appears to be no way to deselect or stop editing the title for a tab group.  Attempts to "click off" the title area only blow up the tab group which is not the desired effect.

Similarly, hitting escape or even clicking the pencil icon (both unintuitive ways of ending the editing of a tab group title, IMO) also don't work.

So it feels like once you start editing a tab group's title, you're "stuck" in perpetual "edit mode" for that tab group.  Nothing I did turned off that editing, except for hitting the X - which closed the entire tab group without a confirmation (and for which I submitted a separate bug).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit the tabcandy icon ("Open a visual tab interface")
2. Drag one tab off the main tab area to create a new tab group
3. Drag another tab off the main area onto the new tab group so it has 2 tabs
4. Click the pencil icon in the tab group to edit the title bar
5. Type a title for the tab group
6. Hit escape and notice that the cursor still blinks at the end of the tab group title editing area (indicating you're still editing it)
7. Click somewhere that isn't in any tab group (in a blank area) and notice that the cursor still blinks.
Actual Results:  
The tab group title bar stubbornly remains in editing mode no matter what is done including hitting escape or clicking off (in an area which is not the main tab area or any other subgroup). The only way to end the tab title bar's editing mode is to close the entire tab group, which is not an acceptable way of ending the editing of the tab bar.

Expected Results:  
Hitting escape or "clicking off" (in an area which is not the main tab area or any other subgroup) should end the editing of the tab group title bar.

Even going "into" (restoring) a tab group into a Firefox window doesn't work - when you click the tabcandy icon ("Open a visual tab interface") the title bar text is still highlighted indicating it's in editing mode (argh :)
