The latest version of Google Gears is incompatible with the Fx 3.5.1 update. The reason is that the maxVersion in install.rdf is "3.5" instead of "3.5.*". The fix is to update the install.rdf to use the "3.5.*" maxVersion.

Seems like Google put out an updated version (0.5.30.0) which corrects this bug but the updateURL they're using did not prompt for an update. The following updateURL is specified in install.rdf:

<em:updateURL><![CDATA[https://tools.google.com/service/update2/ff?guid=%ITEM_ID%&version=%ITEM_VERSION%&application=%APP_ID%&appversion=%APP_VERSION%&dist=google&os=osx]]></em:updateURL>

Aaron, can you check to see if this URL is responding correctly on your end as I wasn't prompted to update from 0.5.29.0 to 0.5.30.0 on Mac OSX.

Conversely, my 2 Windows XP boxes all updated fine to the latest Gears versions.
According to Aaron, this should be fixed as of tonight.
