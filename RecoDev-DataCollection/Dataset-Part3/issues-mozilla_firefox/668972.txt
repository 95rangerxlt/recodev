The menuitems have references to the content window (menuitem.requestingWindow) and document (menuitem.requestingDocument) and stick around when the options popup closes, until you open it again, at which point there will be new menuitems with new content references.

How can this be verified?

Sounds like at worst we leak one pop-up when this happens? If so, this doesn't seem like the kind of change we want to put into Beta.
Can anyone please provide some STR / guidelines to verify this fix?

Thanks!
