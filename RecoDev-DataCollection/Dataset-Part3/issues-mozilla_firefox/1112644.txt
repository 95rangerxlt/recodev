make timeline tests work on e10s

This changes the timeline marker tests to work with e10s.

I also took the opportunity to share code which was formerly copied
into the various test files.  I put the browser process code into
head.js and shared content code into a new "frame-head.js".

make timeline tests work on e10s

The basic idea of this patch is to split the tests into a small
bit on the browser side, that loads the real tests into the content
process.  "ok", "is", and "info" are defined on the content side
to just forward messages to the browser process.
Is there any value in running these tests in a remote tab?

What about running them in a chrome mochitest instead? Them we would not have to deal with E10S.

I didn't realize this could work for these tests.
I'll investigate.

I don't want to block this. And I believe using a chrome mochitest might not work well as we want to use an actual tab.
Thanks, Paul.
