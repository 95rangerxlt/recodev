Some of the tests (http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/accessible/tests/mochitest/events/docload_wnd.xul possibly among others) use tabbrowser elements outside of the browser.xul context.  That way, the TabView object does not exist, and we'll get errors like:

JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml, line 722: TabView is not defined

on the console.

This will cause some tabbrowser methods to throw, which _could_ cause some leaks in the tests because some stuff won't be cleaned up completely.
