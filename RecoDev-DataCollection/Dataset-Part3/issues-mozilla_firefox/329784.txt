WFM. Sometimes after changing versions I see http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/central/ but certainly not after clicking the home button.
I also noticed that the bookmark toolbar had disappeared altogether. The Bookmarks menu had only two entries - Bookmark this and Manage Bookmark.

There was a Places link which was blank. Managing bookmark brought up a webpage of blank(looks like the new interface for managing bookmark).
Can not reproduce these bugs anymore.
