In the new cookie manager dialog, I frequently hang after opening / closing a
cookie group.

This happened to me when I wrote the new RSS subscription manager UI as an
outliner view because I wasn't calculating the # of rows correctly after
toggling a container back to the closed state. Maybe its the same issue here...

If someone is able to provide a set of steps to reproduce or a cookies file for
this it'd be great, since I've never seen this one. 
all i have to do is delete some cookies, open and close a cookie container and I
hit the hang. Ben, make sure your row count is being counted correctly in your
Toggle method for the outliner
I'm pretty sure this:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/preferences/cookies.js#382

should be

gCookiesWindow._tree.treeBoxObject.rowCountChanged(aIndex, delta);

and not

gCookiesWindow._tree.treeBoxObject.rowCountChanged(aIndex + 1, delta);

That's why the hang is happening.

In Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > View Cookies I sometimes get crashing.
This seems to happen most when I have lots of cookies in the browser and I try
and scroll to the end of the cookies list. The further I scoll down, the more
sluggish response seems to be; ff eventually hangs.
Yeah.. the whole new cookie manager is very slow, and I get the crash when
closing the folder for the sites as well. I like the new interface, but we
really have to do something about the slowness.

I think I have come across this as well though I seem to find it when doing
things quickly, in fact if I open the cookies view and just click around in the
tree area very quickly the thing soon hangs.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Cookies Window
2. Open two folders
3. Click on a child of one to select it
4. Click on the twisty of the other one to close it

Expected Results:
- other one closes

Actual Results:
- application hangs. 
I can confirm that those steps cause the hang for me.

patch

1. Reverts earlier attempt at quick fix. 
2. Makes sure getParentIndex always returns -1 for items that are at the top
level of the hierarchy (this is not a problem for filtered view, since in that
case the function just always returns -1.)
I filed bug 285002 for slow scrolling/redrawing in new cookies window with many
cookies
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
