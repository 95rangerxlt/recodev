According to this page [1] canvas in Mozilla can have the dom attribute "dom-opaque"="true" (bug 430906) and this could speed up their rendering.

Since, I believe all our tab canvases are always opaque, we should be slapping this on all our canvases.

Whoops! Make that "moz-opaque".

Do we need a test for this?

Looks good to me, bug I'd also like to hear from roc, for verification that this is a good idea.

No test needed.

Why so? 'true' seems to be working.

Right, and when someone wants to revert this, they'll use moz-opaque='false' and have a hard time finding out why that doesn't change anything. See <http://www.whatwg.org/html/#boolean-attributes>.
Agree with Ms2ger on ='true' being bug-bait. But shorter's better, so why not use just moz-opaque (no ='' or =anything)?
