Meta bug for a variety of context menu issues that have come up recently.
Many of these bugs will be because commands aren't being updated properly, likely because they're using the child process UpdateCommands rather than the parent. I filed 1060529 on this issue.
Move old M2's low-priority bugs to M6 milestone.
I think 1058787, 1058883, 1058539, and 1068736 and possibly others may be caused by the spellchecking error, bug 1071771, of which a workaround is now checked in. I can reproduce some of them before that patch, and not after, and the remainder I cannot reproduce at all.

Can we close bug 1071771? Its currently marked leave-open.
We can, but we should then file another bug about fixing it properly.
No dependencies, so closing.
