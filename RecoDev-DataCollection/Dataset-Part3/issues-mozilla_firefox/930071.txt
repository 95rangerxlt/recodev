From https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/2013-October/001041.html we shouldn't keep around Telemetry probes that aren't being used and don't have a future goal in mind that is keeping them around.

We have a Telemetry probe that measures how long it takes the Site Identity panel to open, but it isn't being referred to in any current work and I don't see a use for it in the near future.

It also needs to be removed from Histograms.json.

Devdatta had been using these security/identity probes for some research. I don't think this particular one was being used, but I'll let him confirm.
