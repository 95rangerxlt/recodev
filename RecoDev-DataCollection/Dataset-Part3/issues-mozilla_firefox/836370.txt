I have two Windows machine. Only difference between them might be HWA enabled/disabled. But on one of them, Tab to complete works, while it fails on other.

I will try to investigate further to find the cause.

Not enough details, TAB works for me. Closing. Please re-open if more details emerge.
From last 2 days in Nightly, on Windows 7, Tab complete is broken. Nothing happens when you press Tab. I have tried with add-ons disabled too. Can you get a Windows 7 PC to check ? or some other Windows 7 person can confirm ?
I don't see this any more.
