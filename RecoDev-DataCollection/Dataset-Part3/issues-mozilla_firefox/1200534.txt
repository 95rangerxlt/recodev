James, could we upgrade React to 0.14? It contains a fix to generate XML-compatible void tags and boolean attributes, needed for use in XUL and XHTML (see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4756).

Setting needinfo.
Awesome, great find! Sure I'd love to. Let's check the status of 0.14 though to make sure it's stable. I'm pretty sure it's beta status and about to be released, so I'm sure it's fine.

1200534.patch

Here it is. The only problem with doing this is Honza is trying hard to get bug 1132203 and seems really close, and I feel bad switching this out from underneath him.

Jan, would it be ok if we let bug 1132203 land, and than afterwards we can land this and help deal with any issues? Not much changed in 0.14, so there isn't any wasted work there.

You can develop locally on top of this patch for now. Sound good?

OK for now, but I'm aiming to land something that needs this by the end of September.

Shouldn't be a problem, if Honza continually has trouble landing the JSON viewer we'll just go ahead and land this, and help him make any changes. I'd like to give him a week at least to see if it will land smoothly (it's already been blocked a lot).

Yes, sounds good. I've quickly tested JSON Viewer on top of 0.14
(the attached patch) and all look OK

Yes, sounds like a plan.

Honza
James, given that bug 1132203's patches just landed in fx-team, and that Honza's JSON Viewer seems to work on top of 0.14, would you mind if we land this bug soon?
("just landed" being 6 hours ago)
Yeah, let's work on landing this. Feel free to make a try push, otherwise I can do that later today or tomorrow.

Upgrade devtools version of React to 0.14-rc1.

James, I stole your patch, rebased it on top of our giant file move, fixed the upgrade instructions, and imported React v0.14-rc1 (instead of beta3). Does that work for you?

Looks good to me, thanks!

I don't have time to look into this right now, but doesn't 0.14 split the packages out into React and ReactDOM, the latter being the one you use for the DOM backend? I guess it's still bundled in here somehow, which is fine but I'm curious why we weren't affected by that.
Sheriffs, please land this just before the patch in bug 1196785.
