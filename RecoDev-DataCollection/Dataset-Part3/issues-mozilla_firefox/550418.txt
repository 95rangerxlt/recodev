all other add-ons disabled and problem persists.  whitelisted getpersonas.com with Adblock as well.  screen of the problem http://i49.tinypic.com/9sqh7b.jpg
fwiw, I see adblock plus in the top right, so not all add-ons were disabled. ABP probably isn't the issue, but it means there could be another add-on causing the problem.
Also "iGoogle" in the first tab is red and italic, which must be done by an add-on.

Please reopen if this has steps to reproduce that don't involve add-ons.
this was taken when they first observed the problem.  the thread is here http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-personas/browse_thread/thread/196530dabc3ae17c/352743107e9fcde7?hl=en_US&lnk=gst&q=Navigation#352743107e9fcde7
Why have you marked this "fixed"? Did the problem go away?
