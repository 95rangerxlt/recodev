Panorama should use the thumbnail service to display thumbnails for not-yet-restored tabs. We can rip out the whole thumbnail storage and other code parts with this.

Also, this will fix bug 738128.

Part 2 - Correct Panorama tests

Explaining some changes:

>--- a/browser/components/tabview/test/Makefile.in
>                  browser_tabview_bug596781.js \
>-                 browser_tabview_bug597248.js \
>                  browser_tabview_bug597360.js \

Removing the test for bug 597248. No need to make sure Panorama's thumbnail cache is solid anymore.

>                  browser_tabview_bug626791.js \
>-                 browser_tabview_bug627288.js \
>                  browser_tabview_bug627736.js \

Removing test for bug 627288 because TabItem.showCachedData() retrieves its data now from TabItem.getTabState() which is never stale. Title and URL (and therefore the thumbnail) are always up-to-date.

>                  browser_tabview_bug673729.js \
>-                 browser_tabview_bug677310.js \
>                  browser_tabview_bug678374.js \

Removing test for bug 677310 because we can't control whether all thumbnails have been captured before transitioning into private browsing mode. This is okay since we shouldn't execute any sync operations and most thumbnails should have been stored anyway before entering PB mode.

Part 1 - Make Panorama use the thumbnail service

And again explaining some changes:

>--- a/browser/components/tabview/content.js

There's a lot of stuff we can remove from the Panorama content script. The majority of the code was there to figure out the storage policy for thumbnails.

>diff --git a/browser/components/tabview/storagePolicy.js b/browser/components/tabview/storagePolicy.js
>diff --git a/browser/components/tabview/thumbnailStorage.js b/browser/components/tabview/thumbnailStorage.js

We don't the thumbnail storage and its storage policy anymore.

>--- a/browser/components/tabview/tabitems.js
>   _reconnect: function TabItem__reconnect(options) {
>     Utils.assertThrow(!this._reconnected, "shouldn't already be reconnected");
>     Utils.assertThrow(this.tab, "should have a xul:tab");
> 
>     let tabData = Storage.getTabData(this.tab);
>     let groupItem;
> 
>     if (tabData && TabItems.storageSanity(tabData)) {
>-      this.loadThumbnail();
>+      // Show the cached data while we're waiting for the tabItem to be updated.
>+      // If the tab isn't restored yet this acts as a placeholder until it is.
>+      this.showCachedData();
> 

We never show stale data, we just create a placeholder while the tab is loading/restoring or waiting to be restored. So we can just unconditionally call showCachedData() because this gets removed when the TabItem is updated.

Forgot to remove the now empty TabItem.loadThumbnail() method:
