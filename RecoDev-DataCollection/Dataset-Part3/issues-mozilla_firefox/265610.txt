Scrolling content behind a transparant GIF is a real slowdown.
My AthlonXP 3200+ with a Geforce5200 has around 90% CPU load.
Performed a testcase with the same site and a transparant PNG> much faster and
acceptable scrolling speeds!


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to above mentioned URL
2. Scroll vertically
3.

Actual Results:  
Real slow scrolling and a high CPU load.

Expected Results:  
normal page scrolling speed.

Noticably slow are the scrolls when clicking on the arrows of the verical
scrollbar (and visible on high resolutions).

Confirming

I didn't have the problem before because I used 16-bit color i/o 32-bit
It makes a huge difference in performace for me (32-it a lot worse)
Actually to me it seems that the scrolling content behind the transparant GIF
scrolls at the speed it should do; it's the rest of the page outside the GIF
that is lagging whilst scrolling.
Updated the URL (previous URL disappeared)

This bug may be related to bug 201198.

And checking 201198 with various driver / monitor depths is an excellent idea! 
I'll try it....

Excellent example of bug 284986

Sorry to be slightly off topic, but the URL for this bug turns out to be the
best example of bug 284986 I've seen yet.  I'd bet they're related.
Could this bug be related to  Bug 64401, Extremely slow performance with png
background??
There's been some progress on transparent GIF speeds recently, and it may have
effected this bug.

Reporter, can you try this with a latest nightly?

It is fixed here, no more high CPU load during scroll.

But I'm still seeing the problem described in comment#4: content in the
transparant gif 'box' is painted before the rest of the content. But that
problem may not be in the scope of this bug?

Scrolling up and down quickly with smoothscroll enabled and an MS Intellimouse 4
I can get my CPU usage up to 83%, but at all times scrolling is fast and

New testcase, previous not working anymore
This is WFM using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10
can be marked as dupe of bug #595671
FIXED as per comment 13 and comment 14.
