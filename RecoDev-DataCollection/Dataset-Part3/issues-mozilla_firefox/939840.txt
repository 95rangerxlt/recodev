In Firebug's box model pane, we can see all positioning information for an element, if it's relatively or absolutely or fixed positioned (and "position: sticky" could be nice to know now too).

We can also see the z-index although that's less useful to me.

In my day to day debugging, I really miss that ability in the native Dev Tools.

r+ assuming that try is green
Maybe I was not clear enough in comment 0, but I'd like to see also the top/left/right/bottom properties when the element is positioned.

Alright. This is the first part (showing position), for top/left/right/bottom properties, it will happen in bug 940275.
