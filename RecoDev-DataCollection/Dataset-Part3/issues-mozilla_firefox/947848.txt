There's really no room available, so displaying them is pretty useless.
This is as simple as adding

#body[layout=vertical] #stackframes {
  visibility: hidden;
}

to the debugger css files.
I'm free to help, can I be the fixer?
Sure! Let me know if you need any help.
Great. Let me see what's going on, I will ping you asap if I have any queries.
