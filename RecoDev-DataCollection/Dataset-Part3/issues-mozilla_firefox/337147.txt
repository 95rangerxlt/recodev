This works for me with the latest 1.8 branch build on windows.

WIP fix -- might need some CSS work in winstripe

This fixes the problem on other platforms, but I can't figure out how to make the hover border not show up on the search-engine icon button in Windows.  Work In Progress pending that polish.

Simpler solution for all platforms
Mostly looks good--why does the patch remove the inheritance of "src" from the go button?

The "._textbox" part is unnecessary here (see http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/search/content/search.xml&rev=1.56#165 )

It was left over from when the go button was also the engine icon.  Since the go button doesn't change icons anymore, it's no longer needed and potentially confusing.

I saw that, but to me it's clearer to call the method on the object that's  being focused, since it's readily available in that handler.  Is there a benefit to calling it on the searchbar instead?

Probably not... I was thinking that one of those methods may be extended to do additional things in the future, but I guess that's not very likely.

When (and why) did this change from how it works in 1.5 (clicking on the favicon opens the engine chooser menu and moves focus to the box as well)?

In the 1.5 searchbar you can click the icon, choose your engine (or press escape), and immeadiatly begin typing (any previous text is selected and replaced as soon as you type).
Bug 335441 added a Search button to the right of the searchbox, analogous to the Go button for the location box, and moved the engine selection from the icon to the new Search button so more people can discover that it exists.

In the 2.0a searchbar you can click the Search button's drop-down arrow, choose your engine, and immediately begin typing (any previous text is selected and replaced as soon as you type).  Or if you want to use the engine already selected, you can either click on the engine icon, which also selects all the text in the field, or you can click in the textbox and replace the existing text in the usual way (drag over it, use the Select All command, use the Web Search command, etc.).
