I need to bump the app version strings to 1.4.1 on the branch.

Also need to change the hard coded labels to Beta 2 instead of Beta 1.

cc'ing Darin and Ben to make sure they recognize and are ok with beta 2 being:

1.4.1

presumably the RC's would then be 1.4.2, 1.4.3, etc.

The first RC and each after should have version 1.5.  It should look exactly
like the final release so it can be a true candidate for that release.
