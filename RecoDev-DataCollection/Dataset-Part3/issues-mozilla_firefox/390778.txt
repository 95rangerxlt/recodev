1. New profile, start firefox
2. Install TMP 0.3.6.0.070714 from http://tmp.garyr.net/tab_mix_plus-dev-build.xpi
3. Restart firefox

Expected:
Bookmarks in Bookmarks Toolbar

Actual:
No Bookmarks in Bookmarks Toolbar, browser consumes 99% CPU time.

Works: 20070802_2342_firefox-3.0a7pre.en-US.win32
Broken: 20070802_2359_firefox-3.0a7pre.en-US.win32

Checkins to module PhoenixTinderbox between 2007-08-02 23:42 and 2007-08-02 23:58 :

Due to bug 378866, but since this is an extension problem I guess it's TMP's responsibility to work?

Actually, scratch the bit about 99% CPU usage, that's wrong. But add this in the error console:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Operation is not supported"  code: "9" nsresult: "0x80530009 (NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR)"  location: "chrome://tabmixplus/content/tabmix.js Line: 204"]
IMO, we should keep the patch for bug 378866 and if some extensions 
break, they are doing evil things. Would be great to have 
minimal testcase of what TMP does.

er, maybe not. Have to test something...
doh, I thought there was a case bug 378866 didn't handle properly, but 
it should be ok after all.

But I found still one other case bug 378866 doesn't handle (not related 
to this bug), so I'll have to back it out.

Or I may have to back it out.


Backed out bug 378866.
