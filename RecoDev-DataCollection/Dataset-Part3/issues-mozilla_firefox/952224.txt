Bug 918024 Removed the synchronous start up fallback for sessions store. We left the calls to |_ensureInitialized()| so we would throw an error if someone attempted to trigger the removed code path.

Since Bug 918024 landed, we haven't seen reports of these errors and we should eventually remove this code if everything stays quiet.

Remove calls to _ensureInitialized() (version 1)

If I'm interpreting this correctly, it sounds like we want to remove _ensureInitialized() and any calls to it. I went ahead and did that in this patch; let me know if I'm on the right track.

Assuming that this is the right approach, it looks like doRestore() would no longer have a possibility of throwing an error, so I removed its |@throws| line as well.
