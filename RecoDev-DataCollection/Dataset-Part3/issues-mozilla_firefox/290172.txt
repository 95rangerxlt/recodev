8.focus in the locationbar

10.press [left arrow] .... 
11.page reloads
12.focus/cursor is no longer in the locationbar
let's try blaming bug 283777 for a start :)
This was caused by 283777, as far as I can tell. The easiest solution is
probably to check for an open popup (using mInput->GetPopupOpen) before calling
HandleEnter.

fix

Restores location bar to proper working order.	This is a reimplementation of
the changes from bug 283777 attachment 175688.	Rather than na√Øvely call
HandleEnter any time a left or right arrow is pressed, only fill the text box
if the popup is open and has a selected item, then close any open popup. 
HandleEnter doesn't work in the location bar or search bar because pressing
enter in those contexts causes the browser to load the URL or perform the
search.

this isn't in 1.0.3, 
thankfully, but this should go into 1.0.4 if there is one, but we'd need a
modified patch to replace what's on branch properly.  If you could do that it'd
be great.

I'll land this shortly, thanks a lot!

Mark, can you port this patch to the aviary 1.0.1 branch so we can take that
instead of the patch for bug 283777?  If not, please let me know.
Pulling the 1_0_1 tree now.  Thanks, Mike.
Bringing this back over to bug 283777 for work on the AVIARY_1_0_1 branch.  The
problem patch never landed there and thus this bug doesn't apply.  Attachment
180857 is a port of this trunk patch to the 1.0.x branch.
