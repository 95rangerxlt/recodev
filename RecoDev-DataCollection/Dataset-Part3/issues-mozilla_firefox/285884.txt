Flash-based movie makes Firefox crash if you play and pause it somewhere in the
movie. Sometimes it doesn't crash when you close Firefox. This time, however,
Firefox doesn't start when you try to open it again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL
2. Play and pause Flash-based movie
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes or crashes. It's visually more obvious if the page is opened in
a tab.

Expected Results:  
Should not crash or freeze.

asteko83: Could you provide Talkback incident id of your crash?
Talkback doesn't run, even though it's enabled. Here's is a screenshot of that
moment. Notice that 'close tab' button is in 'pressed' position. Title of
Firefox says "Mozilla Firefox (Not responding".

(Same build, but English-US and on Windows 2000).

You point out this is a flash based movie. What version of Flash do you have
installed? Have you tried updating / reinstalling that?
I re-installed Flash player version 7,0,19,0. This time Firefox freezes for less
than a second, but it keeps working.

Changing status to FIXED.
