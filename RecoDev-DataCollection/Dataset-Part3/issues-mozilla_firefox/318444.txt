Use the treeview to create a folder on the places toolbar and a folder inside of it with some bookmarks.  Now try to click the folder on the toolbar and look inside the subfolder.  When you try to open the popup menu for the subfolder, you get an assertion "You can't dereference a NULL nsCOMPtr with operator->()."  The popup menu from the subfolder never shows up.

The assertion comes from line 1309 of nsMenuFrame.cpp, which is "mOpenTimer->Cancel();" (in nsMenuFrame::Notify())

Putting log statements in the _rebuild method of places-menupopup shows that it gets called for the subfolder and creates menuitems for all the bookmarks, and I can see the popup menus in DOM Inspector.

Annie, you might want to run in the debugger and reproduce this and see what's causing. I see it too. 
The problem was that the handler for the popupshowing event in the places-menupopup didn't check if the event.target==this.  So the child menu event propogated to the parent, which tried to rebuild it's menu while that menu was showing.  This caused the assertion.

I fixed it by adding an event.target==this check to the handler, and accidentally checked in the fix with my patch for bug 318444.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
