search.rdf appears to be obsolete, yet we have code in firefox to support it and we include it with our distribution.

I believe it was used for the (no defunct) search sidebar?  (was this replaced by simply allowing bookmarks to be loaded in the sidebar, see bug #213236?

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder makes it sound like the functionality of search.rdf was replaced by search.sqlite (but looking at jminta's patch for bug #335101, it looks like he just moved the functionality from prefs to mozStorage, so perhaps search.rdf was deprecated a while ago.)

additionally, it is part of the localizations http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n/find?string=search.rdf, yet of the 56 locales it 43 of the search.rdf appears to be identical.

spun off from bug #364599

Yeah, that file has never been used for anything useful in Firefox, as far as I know. It was copied because the old search service depended on it, and should be removed now that we don't use the old search service anymore.

That article is wrong. Let's see if I can find my old kb.mozillazine.org account...

Fix v.1

bsmedberg: tagging you for review in hopes that if anyone knows if there's a reason why our directory service handles panels.rdf it will be you (the only in-tree caller, the suite's nsSidebar.js, expects that if it doesn't exist it will be created with a copy from defaults, which we don't do, so I'd expect anyone doing a sidebar panel extension already works around us).

That seriously sucks, that 13 locales thought they had to translate something which has never been used. We really need a low-friction way for localizers to tell us about the useless stuff we never notice because there's no reason for us to look at it.

Fix v.2

Where by "v.2" I mean "v.1, only the diff including all the files that I saved in the wrong place, not the one only including some of the files that I saved in the right place."

I was a little worried that mozilla/extensions/inspector/resources/content/prefs/pref-sidebar.js gets and uses the panels file, but it appears that pref-sidebar.js is only used to overlay a SeaMonkey-specific file, so this should be OK.

Theoretically this might be used by extensions, but I think the chances of that are low enough (and it's easy enough to work around) that we don't have to worry about it

Need to make the same change to mozilla/browser/installer/windows/packages-static too (that file doesn't get indexed by LXR for some reason).
I think we should also add this removed file to http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/installer/removed-files.in, so that the installer and software update will remove it.

it won't hurt anything by having it there (I don't think), but we should clean up after ourselves. 

gavin, what do you think?

Yeah, that's a good idea.

I know it's not reasonable to ask, but since I don't build on Windows, it'd be comforting if one of you two built with this, and made sure the installer removes the default search.rdf without removing either body parts, or C:\
thanks for working on this phil.  is the removed-files.in change the only difference between the two versions of your patch?  if so, then r=sspitzer on that one line change (since you have r=gavin on the rest).

important note:

the removed-files.in change makes me want to test one thing after we land it on the trunk:  I want to make sure that on windows, if search.rdf has the "read only" attribute set, then both partial / complete software update will work.

I claim that it should, since I fixed the updater on the trunk (and branches) to deal with this exact scenario, but this would be worth triple checking.

this scenario could happen in the real world, if a user happened to go from 2.0.0.1 de windows to 2.0.0.x latest (which would have the fixed updater.exe), and then to Firefox 3 (one day) via a major update, so the fixed updater.exe could handle the read only attribute on search.rdf.

for more information, see bug #367084 and bug #364599.

I'll gladly help test this after it lands.
Two changes, adding to removed-files.in, and the comment 4 removal from browser/installer/windows/packages-static
