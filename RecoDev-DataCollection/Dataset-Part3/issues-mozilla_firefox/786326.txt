Why does this only affect the first popup?

> Why does this only affect the first popup?

TBH I'm not certain, but I think it has to do with panel.boxObject.show setting up display prior to css being set during popupshowing.  I haven't traced everything through the boxobject class, there's a lot to digest.  Maybe Neil can give a more informed answer?
The side attribute can be computed dynamically based on where the panel is opened, the position of which can be specified differently for each call to openPopup. However, the computations only work when the horizontal or vertical arrangement is known beforehand (defaulting to vertical like the bookmarks panel). This issue can also occur if you open a popup to the side and then open it vertically. Since changing the orientation isn't a normal operation (indeed, we haven't seen usage of side arrow panels yet), the arrow panels don't currently handle it.
