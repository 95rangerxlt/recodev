After using this: http://www.kevinroth.com/rte/demo.htm rich text editor, meta
refresh stops working.  I realize this:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209020 bug has been made/fixed
already, though I think that bug is in reference to another rich text editor.  I
thought it would be fixed in 1.0.7, but it doesn't seem to be the case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.kevinroth.com/rte/demo.htm
2. Go to another page that uses <meta http-equiv="refresh"> in it
3. Watch it not refresh

Actual Results:  
It just doesn't refresh

Expected Results:  
Refresh to the page specified

The 1.0.x is a static codebase there have not been many changes since August of
2005. Firefox 1.5 will be the first release with this fix in it. 

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 209020 ***
This isn't a duplicate.  Please actually look into this. Before using that
editor <meta refresh> works.  After, it doesn't. I realize maybe I'm wrong about
this, but as I noted in my original Comments, I have read the bug that this was
marked as a duplicate of, and still think I have found a bug.
Well can you reproduce it in a current nightly,
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.8/ or
Firfox 1.5Beta 2 which should be released in the next week.
Yes, the nightly build seems to have resolved this issue.  If my
misunderstanding was at fault for reopening this, many apologies.
