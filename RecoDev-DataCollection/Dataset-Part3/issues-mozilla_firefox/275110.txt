On line 587 of contentAreaUtils.js, you'll see:

fileName = fileName.replace(/^"|"$/g, "");

This strips quotes returned from getParameter(), where it is asked for the file
name suggested in the Content-disposition value of the HTTP response header.
This violates RFCs 2183 and 2616. This line appears to be a hack added in
response to bugzilla sending incorrect headers, which biesi and I discovered
today. See bug 275108. The value you get from getParameter() is the correct
suggested value - it shouldn't be messed with.

The solution is to just remove that line.
ccing jshin, since that "hack added in response to bugzilla sending incorrect
headers" was actually added in bug 215493 as a port of bug 158006 (where I don't
see any mention of bugzilla's headers) which Seamonkey used right up until bug
160454 pulled all that code out in October. Might be worthwhile finding out why
it was there before we rip it out as having been a bugzilla workaround.
Phil, that bug did not add this line. see the patch there - attachment 126311
shows that the line existed before, it was just moved.

Instead, bz added it in bug 121509. it seems to me, though, that at least since
we have nsIMIMEHeaderParam we don't need it anymore.
Note that this line exists in and should be removed from the code that the moz
suite uses for the same purpose...

hm... really? I can't find it; could you mention the location of that line?
biesi is right -- this line can just go.  

And I also can't seem to find it in trunk seamonkey....
