Steps to reproduce:

I you clear all the history of your profile, New Tab Page removes thumbnails until next restart, but not immediately (press F5 to refresh New Tab Page and observe).

Another side effect: if you clear browsing history + cache, New Tab Page removes immediately website thumbnail but keep a blank thumbnail (gray background) with its title.

We need to ensure that the test continues *after* every other callback has been called.

That's legacy code referring to a non-existant object.

The cache isn't properly re-filled when setting it to '[]'.

hm. i don't know what's more resource efficient - keeping a flag around for the lifetime of the app or making a method that memoizes itself into a no-op after first run.

I'd at least expect the JS engine to optimize and remove empty functions and all calls to them. Also, I like this more than keeping the flag around.

This fixes bug 733329. We shouldn't access the grid and its cells before the page has been initialized.

I needed to change this back because this is the cause of the leak. I didn't understand why this causes a leak but this fix isn't really necessary. We don't really use resetCache() in the wild, only for testing.

i don't really like the way cells is used globally, but that's not really part of this patch. can you file a bug to update it to at least be gCells or something?
