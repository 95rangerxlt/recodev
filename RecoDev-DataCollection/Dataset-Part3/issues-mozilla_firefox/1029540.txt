numberWithDecimals(0.0001, 2) // "00"

It should be "0" or "0.0" or "0,0" instead, but since we don't know the localization settings ("," or "."?), we should simply return "0".

I think browser.ini needs to be rebased.  Looks good besides that, just a couple of questions about the early return.

I'm actually not sure what case this is catching.  Is this just an early return to prevent some computation or is this actually changing the output of the function?  For instance, if I run l10n.numberWithDecimals(123, 10); with or without the patch, I get the same result.

Also, do all locales use , for grouping?

Scratch that, I see the case in the first comment
With the patch applied:

l10n.numberWithDecimals(0.0001, 2); // "0"
l10n.numberWithDecimals(0.001, 2);  // "0.00"
l10n.numberWithDecimals(1.00001, 2) // "1"

I'm not really sure what the right result here is, but it is a bit odd that some decimals become NUM and some become NUM.00.  Luckily this also fixed what looks like a really bad bug without the patch applied:

l10n.numberWithDecimals(1.00001, 2) // "10" ? huh
This is Number.toLocaleString misbehaving. There's nothing I can do about that, like for 0.0001 vs. 0.001.
