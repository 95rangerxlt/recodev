The new Profiler tool that landed in bug 795268 has its UI hard-coded in English. The only thing that is localizable is the tab in the developer tools window and the item in Firefox's Developer Tools menu.

Make Profiler UI localizable

Made all UI (incl. Cleopatra) strings localizable. Not that for Cleopatra I updated only those strings that are used in our Profiler.

This looks fine, although it totally breaks cleopatra out from the original repo. We're a total fork now.

I guess this means we can seriously consider making it themeable as bug 823026 suggests.

do these need string arguments? If so you should explain what they are.

Added additional comments explaining string arguments for startProfiling and stopProfiling strings.

Rob, my plan is to push strings.js (although modified) upstream. Then all we will need to modify is strings.js which makes it easier to pull changes from upstream.

Can someone explain what "self" is expected to mean? I'm trying the profiler but I'm not sure about it.

I would also say that the strings displayed between the moment you stop the profiler and the graph is displayed are still hardcoded(processing working request..., finished and a couple others before these).
"Self" is how much time was spent doing work directly in that function. As opposed to the total time which is how much time was spent in that function and in functions it called.

As for progress strings I was thinking about removing them at all (or replacing with "Loading...").
Filed bug 837735 about removing strings.
Thanks Anton, I think that adding this as a localization comment inside the file would be greatly appreciated by other localizers.

P.S. If you go for "loading...", don't forget to use the proper single unicode character ("loadingâ€¦")
