The favicon and logo in about:home are not retinafied.  I see these images ship in the client, looking at 
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/9ca690835a5e/browser/base/content/abouthome/aboutHome.xhtml

Can we get retina versions of these to be used in appropriate builds?  Thanks!

Huh, I thought we had already made sure that all of the about:home iconography supported HiDPI. The favicon has _32.png in the filename for example.

Frank, was there a reason we left these out? (I don't have a retina to test with.)
It should be "retinafied". We're definitely using the 32px file. Laura, where are you seeing this in pixelated form?
To be clear, the favicon is a sufficiently high-resolution image, as far as I can tell.
The logo is an image that is slightly lower-resolution than it needs to be to support "Retina" displays. Currently, we're displaying a 210px image at 154px CSS pixels (308 screen pixels).
We saw an image from a user on twitter pointing out the problem areas on retina displays:

That's what sparked this. Laura already filed another bug for the snippet image for the snippets service. Is there anything that can be done about the search icon?

That's bug 795495 and is fixed in Firefox 23. Thank you for filing these to make sure that they were addressed.
Morphing this bug as the Firefox logo appears to be the only thing non-snippet that can still be made better.

We fixed the favicon (bug 848150) in Firefox 22, which as of this writing is still in beta.
We're currently displaying the logo at 154 CSS pixels, so a 2x version would be 308px, but perhaps 256px is sufficient.

If so, we could simply remove about-logo.png, which is a rather non-standard size (210px square) and simply use default256.png instead. Unfortunately, default256.png is only available in browser/branding/official/, and it's not even used in the codebase as far as I can tell, so I'm not sure why it exists at the moment.

What do you think, Stephen?

I am doing some work in this area today. Will try and figure out the best way to go.
Bug 884011 has fixed this en passant.
