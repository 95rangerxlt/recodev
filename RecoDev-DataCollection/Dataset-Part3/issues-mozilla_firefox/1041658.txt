Hi Florian, can you mark this bug as either [qa+] or [qa-] for verification.
I'm a little confused here: if I'm assigned as QA for a ticket for writing tests, does that mean the expectation is that I'll be writing the test, or the assigned person writes the test and the QA contact verifies the tests are working? :-)

I think you were assigned as QA by mistake, [qa-] in the QA whiteboard indicates that QA isn't needed here.
QA Contact really just means that you're the person responsible for testing. If the bug doesn't need testing, as indicated by [qa-] then there's no action needed on your part. However I still think it's useful to keep the QA contact assigned in case something comes up that invalidates the [qa-] or in case follow-up questions arise that need input from QA. 

It just saves people from having to track someone down.
Florian -- Are we going to uplift this to Fx33?  I believe we are NOT (based on our irc conversation).  So, are you ok with removing "[sceensharing-uplift]" from the whiteboard?

I think we will, yes. Changes here will be test-only.

The bug I mentioned during our IRC conversation was bug 1041660.

Patch

Requesting review as the test passes locally for me on both Mac and Windows, and a previous try run was green, but you may want to wait for the results from try for this exact patch (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=04f3ac66f1c8) before reviewing.

Nit:

let win = Services.wm.getMostRecentWindow("...");

Nit: replace 578-586 with:

let {video: expectVideo, audio: expectAudio, screen: expectScreen} = expected || {};

then you could add the same !! to the 3 is() calls afterwards, but I think it's not even necessary, as is() doesn't use strict equals.

Perhaps for the following 3 is():

for (let item of ["video", "audio", "screen"]) {
  is(elt.getAttribute("sharing" + item), (expected && expected[item]) ? "true" : "",
     item + "global indicator attribute as expected");
}

It's up to you.
Thanks for the review!

This would cause "reference to undefined property expected.screen" JS strict warnings.


I don't have my Windows machine with me today, so I pushed to try again to ensure I didn't break anything while addressing the other 2 comments: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=9374d045164a

I think we should kill the JS strict warning implementation of this type with fire.

In the meantime, I guess you could use some variation of this or leave things as they are, if you prefer.

I actually find this warning quite useful, several times it saved me a lot of time by identifying quickly typos (typically a letter having the wrong case) that could have taken a while to debug otherwise.

There may be a few edge cases where the warning should be disabled.
Try (from comment 9) was green.
