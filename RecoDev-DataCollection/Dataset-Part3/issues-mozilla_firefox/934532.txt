STR:
Add an extra button to the menu panel so that there are two blank spaces at the bottom of the menu panel.
Click on one of the blank spaces.

ER:
The menu panel should not close.

AR:
The menu panel closes.

I don't see why we would want the menu panel to close in this case, and the current Firefox application menu doesn't close when the blank area beneath the Help button is clicked.

This was simpler than I thought.

Our convention is to place these on their own line.

This doesn't make much sense. Once inItem becomes true, it will never lose its truthiness. But the while loop above only enters this block if inItem is false. I think maybe you meant to reference a different variable here (or you can just drop the `inItem || ` part of the expression since it is guaranteed to be false).

Yeah, I added the \!inItem check to the loop condition as an optimization, and forgot to remove the or. Fixed now. Also, I disagree with our no-joined-declarations policy, but I guess I will have to live with that.
