If we had a command line flag to auto-open devtools it would get rid of a step in the process of building / running / testing changes to the devtools code base.

My proposal is that if you `./mach run --devtools` then when the browser starts up a toolbox is opened first thing on the selected tab once the browser starts up.

Haven't heard any objections on the mailing list, so flagging for review.  What do you think about this Ryan?

Seems fine to experiment with these flags however we like.

Would be great to also extend to open a specific tool.

Nit: Please appease my OCD and name this `handleDevToolsFlag` not `handleDevtoolsFlag`
