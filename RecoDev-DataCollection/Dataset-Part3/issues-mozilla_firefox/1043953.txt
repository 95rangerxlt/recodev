This pull request add all the package.json files to each gaia apps
and also ensure setting `origin` attribute in webapp manifests.

pull request 27201 - set origin attribute in each app manifest

Ricky, this patch is necessary in order to tell WebIDE which origin to use when pushing the app. I cleaned up histocal code that was trying to help supporting Fx Nightly and also remove very old comments.

pull request 27201 - set origin attribute in each app manifest

Patch looks fine. I'm curious in what's different between manifest.webapp and update.webapp. It looks like we didn't use update.webapp for a while right?

Gaia owners,

This patch is going to allow you pushing your apps directly from WebIDE,
without having to go throught the command line and running $ APP=foo make install-gaia.
Also, it will work on both simulators and devices!

WebIDE just need these package.json files living in app folders in order to know which command to run to build the app and where to find the built package.

I'm asking review from every owners so that you learn about this file and agree putting such new file in your app!

Can WebIDE take the zip instead of build stage dir? There are still difference between the content of build_stage and the actual files in the zip.

https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/155461a49/build/webapp-zip.js#L130-L172

If you read webapp-zip.js you will find it still do final changes to the files. I know they should all have moved to other steps and changes build_stage directly (Ricky?) but I know at least the |getCompression| part is something only nsIZipWriter can do explicitly (see bug 959047).

Other than that I don't see any problem with the approach here.

Not today, but that's something we can add. It's not easy as WebIDE expect sources unzipped for a validation step where we do various sanity checks before pushing the app and it will be harder doing it from a zip file or we would have to unzip it again :o I'll get back to you about that.

Looks good to me. I didn't try testing it, though.

I suspect that there really shouldn't be a package.json file for apps/sharedtest however, since that directory exists only to host tests. There isn't really an app there.

Fine for the network alerts. Just wondering if this part is necessary or removable for production build?

Patch has problem since build_stage is not currently in final stage. (but it should be)
After finishing build_stage, our workflow continually execute webapp-zip to archive files.
It calls isExcludedFromZip() [1] in order to exclude unnecessary files and adds new l10n files [2] into zip.
That means the result of build_stage is different with application.zip, so there still remain some further works before landing this patch.

[2] https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/155461a49/build/webapp-zip.js#L149-L172
I don't really worry about extra files being included in WebIDE generated zip -- it certainly can be improved but that does not block this bug. The l10n part [3] is especially worrying -- it looks like we will be replace the HTML with the ones got pre-translated -- that means pre-translation will not be picked up by WebIDE.

Should we consider that as a blocker to this feature here? Gandalf? Stas?

BTW, Ricky, could you file bugs on all these? Things don't happen automagically with a "it should be" comment :)

Patch looks good assuming there isn't any considerable impact as stated above. Thanks for working on this!
Bug was filed! See bug 1125031.

You are correct. Without that, we will not have a pretranslated file so we'll be testing non-default locale scenario even for default locale.

In the worst case, you will develop experiencing the startup performance that every non-default locale user does experience. The perf hit currently is minimal to non-existing, so I would say it's not a blocker.

r=me for the added file.

Note that I'll likely not use this much, but because I have some existing habits using custom tools that work for me, not because this is useless ;) I think this could especially be useful for new contributors that don't like the command line much.

The music part looks good to me, thanks!

Ricky, I tweaked this patch in order to blacklist package.json files from zip files, according to comment 18 from Steve.
