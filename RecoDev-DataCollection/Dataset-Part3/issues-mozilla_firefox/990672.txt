If the css file url has anything beyond the css file, like a query string, the style editor will fail to find the path to the linked css file on disk.

Looks good to me.
It's too bad the NetUtils thing we use doesn't allow to remove the query params part itself. 
But I guess there's no harm removing after the '?' character since it's not supposed to appear anywhere else in a URL.
