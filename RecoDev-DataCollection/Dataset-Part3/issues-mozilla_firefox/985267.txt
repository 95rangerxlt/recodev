Steps to reproduce:

Use a Windows 8 RT dark theme on a Windows 7 (x64) machine. Open up the Nightly build. Right-click near the top of the window and check "Menu Bar". View the lack-of-contrast in the menu bar.


Actual results:

The menu bar has very little contrast for the text and the background. It's relatively difficult to read and is very unsightly to say the least.


Expected results:

The menu bar should have been clearly readable.

I've checked https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=863862, in which I observe the actual opposite happening: the inactive menu is more readable than the active menu.

This is similar to the following bug, yet that bug is marked as Windows XP-specific:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=925156

I should note that I've used this theme without problems on the current Firefox release. It only appears to be an issue with Australis.

Attached the inactive menu bar image.
I think the problem is that we can't adjust the menu bar fog based on the system theme colours using CSS-alone. We would need to write code to figure out the colour value and then do something like LightweightThemes and figure out if that colour is "light" or "dark".

I think we can probably fix this more easily by moving this rule to only apply when -moz-windows-default-theme is true since the original commit said this was just for Glass. Do third-party Win7 themes use glass-like transparency? Does anyone use them?

An easier fix would be to remove or reduce the opacity of this fog now that we have the glass fog from the tabs.

Marking P3- as this can stop the menubar from being usable, especially for people who need more contrast.
We could also just make the text color black (instead of the current CaptionText/InactiveCaptionText) like we do for background tabs in this case IIRC.

This. We should just not be using CaptionText for these wherever we have the fog (but we *should* be using it elsewhere, see the XP bugs mentioned originally)

don't use captiontext when we have menubar fog (in compositor),

This should work. Checked that it disabled the rules on win8 with compositor. I still don't know exactly what makes this fog, but I've verified that it isn't there in aero basic, so I believe that 'not compositor' should cover it correctly.

Seems like we'd fall back to MenuText without these rules. That's not guaranteed to be visible on the hardcoded white background either.

No, we don't. See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/browser-aero.css#131

The code you linked to won't change the MenuText color from menu.css, as that targets the menu elements directly.

I guess you could just use color:inherit here to pick up the right color from the toolbar.

Blargh. I totally blame the devtools inspector, which doesn't show these rules when inspecting the menu element in the inspector view, just the browser.css ones - oddly enough, the rules do show up under the 'computed style' view. Go figure.

How is this?

nit: add :not(:-moz-lwtheme), as your comment also only applies in that case. menu.css takes care of :-moz-lwtheme.

I think this should get some QA testing since we had several complaints around this and similar issues.
