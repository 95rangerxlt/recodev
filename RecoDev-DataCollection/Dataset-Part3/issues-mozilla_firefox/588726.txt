Rules show as matched even if they are not matched, in the new Style panel. Example: given a web page with two stylesheets, one for media=screen, and another for media=handheld.

1. handheld.css

h2 { color: red }

2. screen.css

h2 { color: blue }

3. HTML

<h2>hello world</h2>

When you highlight the element, you see that both rules matched. Depending on the CSS files order, you can even get the handheld.css property to show as best match. In truth, handheld.css is never applied to the page.

I think this issue affects any stylesheet for any other @media, and any alternate stylesheet that some pages have.

We need to find a way to check if a certain stylesheet is actually applied or not.

This was an easy fix, it seems. I'll update the main patches from bug 582596 with a fix for this bug as well.
