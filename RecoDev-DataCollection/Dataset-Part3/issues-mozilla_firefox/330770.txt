The upcoming Firefox Alpha1 release will need an update channel of 'beta' rather than 'default' or 'nightly' (whichever is included by default) in order to address that audience as we intend to.

I can help do this Paul if you're caught up in 1.0.x/1.5.0.x fun.


Do we want the update app version/extension versions to be 2.0a, as well?
I've done this, but I'm going to set the blocking flag, since I need to know whether we should tweak any of the other update flags.
I think the 1502 builds should be set to "release", but I'm not sure.  I've asked qa to check the existing builds.
Sounds like we want to include this in 1.5.0.2 so we should plus it.

Davel- Any response from QA?
Please note: this bug is about the release channel status for Firefox 2 alpha1 which Paul correctly changed from Release to Beta on the 2.0a1 builds right before the release. It had no impact on 1.5.0.2/1.5.0.3 at all. I'm not sure where that thread came from.

I believe the bug is being left open because there are a couple other variables we may adjust as well such as app version and ext_version in tinder-config.pl. 

Paul, did you mean to nominate this for blocking-firefox2 perhaps instead of 1.8.0.2?

In any case, if there is some change we want to make to the 1.5.0.x channel (I don't believe there is), we should file a new bug for it since it has nothing to do with the alpha update channel for firefox 2 :)
changing flags per comment 6
This was done ;)
