As opposed to:

openUILinkIn(url, whereToOpenLink(event), { relatedToCurrent: true });

This doesn't work:

openUILink(url, event, { relatedToCurrent: true });

The attached patch fixes that.

these don't match up (allowKeywordFixup and referrerUrl)

Should have a test that would've caught this if there isn't already.
