The "rows" element inside the grid in the bookmark properties dialog box should have an id attribute so extensions can overlay additional properties into the grid.  It would also be helpful if the title and location rows had id attributes, like the shortcut and folder rows have, so extensions overlaying properties into the grid can position them anywhere in the grid.

patch v1: adds appropriate id attributes

This simple patch adds appropriately-named id attributes to the rows element and the title and location row elements.

Looks good, thanks for catching that.

nit: use interCaps instead of foo-bar... it makes reflection into variables easier, because you can just copy-paste the ID:

var placesInfoRows = document.getElementById("placesInfoRows");

sr=ben@mozilla.org with that change.

patch v2: per Ben, uses interCaps

Per Ben, here's a version of the patch that formats ID attributes in interCaps.  I also updated the existing attributes to use interCaps for consistency.

Might as well use editShortcutBox rather than editShortcutbox for consistency with shortcutRow.  Also, take care if landing this patch after 329792, since that patch removes the need for some of the indentifiers you changed.  Thanks!

patch v3: *box -> *Box and editUrlbar -> editURLBar

> Might as well use editShortcutBox rather than editShortcutbox for consistency
> with shortcutRow.

Ok, this patch does that and makes the same change to other identifiers ending in "box":

editTitlebox -> editTitleBox
editShortcutbox -> editShortcutBox
tagbox -> tagBox

I also capitalized the "bar" in "editUrlbar", and I made the "Url" all-caps for consistency with usage in browser.js:

editUrlbar -> editURLBar

patch v4: resolves conflicts with checkin for bug 329792

Here's the previous patch updated to resolve conflicts with the checkin for bug 329792.
Fix checked in to trunk and 1.8 branch.  Thanks Joe and Ben for reviews and sr!
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
