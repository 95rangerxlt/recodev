All it should need is bumping maxVersion and commenting out the "turbo mode" code as I believe it's a Mozilla feature that only generates an error in Fx console.
Actually, the "turbo mode" was an attempt to re-implement the Mozilla (suite) functionality that doesn't exist in Firefox.

What is needed is to re-build against Firefox 2 sources, with VC6.0.  Hopefully with no (or trivial) changes...
I;m not sure that fx2 builds under vc6, but shaver might be able to round up someone to assist in getting this ported over.
Umm, given that about:buildconfig on a Firefox 2 shows it was built with that (cl 12.00.8804), I'd sure hope it builds with VC6! :)

(I'm developing on VC7.1, but for some reason users tend to not have the required C runtime DLL...)

The changes I mentioned are because I haven't built this since bsmedberg moved some things to disallow extensions from poking into the rest of the tree too much.  But that should be trunk-only, so 1.8branch should still be safe.
1.8 branch builds against VC6, yeah.
My apologies.  I've been super busy with my new house, backyard, family, job, etc.  

Plus my yahoo account died.   I'm getting that all back up.  I want to get the extension out within a day or two.  I know how many people use this thing.

Sorry about the grief!  :)
I just realized I'm going to be spending tomorrow night with my nephews at a Utah Jazz game.  So I whipped out and quickly tested a new version tonight.  It's now awaiting approval.
