As discussed...

When installing a sherlock .src file containing a searchForm parameter in Bon Echo, it is expected that the parameter will be copied to the mozSearch .xml file but it isn't.

Reproducible: Always

Morphing this bug a little bit, I found another attribute that isn't saved to disk after installing a Sherlock plugin.

patch

SearchForm is being read but not written, IconUpdateUrl isn't being written at all, so it's lost after a restart.
The exact effects of this bug are:

1) Icon updates don't work after installing a Sherlock plugin and restarting the browser.
2) Tools->Web Search or pressing enter in a blank search bar will not go to the correct location if a Sherlock engine specifies a searchForm and the browser is restarted after install.

Since the patch is simple, and introduces little to no risk of regression, I think this bug should block Firefox 2.
I checked this in yesterday but forgot to mark the bug.

This may not be the best place to ask...

Should this be working in either Fx2 nightlies or beta 2?

Because I still seem to be getting the old behaviour. I guess this is something to do with branches but if you could post a one liner to explain it to this ignoramus I would be grateful.
Ugh, yes, this bug as summarized is fixed, but I just realized bug 352768 is not. I will fix and try to get that into tonight's builds.
