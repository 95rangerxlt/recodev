nsNavHistory.cpp and nsNavHistory.h are very long and confusing. More stuff should be moved to the supporting files.

Patch

This patch adds nsNavHistoryQuery.h and nsNavHistoryResult.h and moves the helper classes out of nsNavHistory.h into them. It also moves all the "query" objects out of nsNavHistory.cpp and into the existing nsNavHistoryQuery.cpp.

No code was changed, stuff was only moved around, and I added a few comments.

Hopefully, things will be much easier to find.
On trunk
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
