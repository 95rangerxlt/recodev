-----------------------------------------------------------------

This looks good, but one question.  This should not pass with bug 816524 backed out, right?  In that case, I'm not sure what the landing plan for this and bug 816524 should be, since bug 816524 also regressed a whole bunch of other tests.  Can you please do a try push with the patch from bug 816524, this one and the MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING thing and see what else in the "bc" test is failing?

Thanks!

Hmm, that's pretty good, it doesn't include any new failures.  I'll push both patches momentarily.
(Filed bug 817931 about the last failure on Linux.)
