Trace something until you hit a breakpoint and the debugger pauses (and tracing is still enabled). Hover over a variable. This performs a client evaluation, causing an (eval) call to be displayed in the Tracer function list. I'm not sure if this should happen.

But what if you call "foo" which calls "bar" etc etc and then something in your app throws? You probably want to see that and also know where it originated.
1. Go to http://htmlpad.org/debugger/, start tracing
2. Click me
3. Hover over "window" in "window.pAsProto = pAsProto;".

There's a ton of stuff shown that we don't care about. As a web developer, I will wonder what "initializeCollector" means and get sad.

This is what's shown for a single eval call.

Clicking on any of these calls trigger the following error:

console.warn: notDebuggee: cannot access the environment of this function.
Handler function _onSelect threw an exception: TypeError: params is undefined

Yeah we should definitely filter out self hosted functions. Not sure if that is what all this junk is. Been meaning to file a bug.
