Hello Firefox-Team,

the Bookmark-Bar-Menu overlays the bookmark-folder (or is to close to it). It could be some pixels down (like in Safari)!

Thanks in advance !

screenshot_white_line_is_missing

Hi together,

thank you for fixing the bug. It looks really good now :-)

But I have noticed, that there is the "white line" missing at the bottom of the Bookmark-Bar-folder when it is pressed.

**Please see enclosed screenshot**

Thank you in advance.

Mehmet
Yeah, the bookmarks bar needs some padding because it's overflow:hidden and cuts the box shadow off. I'll file a bug on that.

I've filed bug 551582 on that.
