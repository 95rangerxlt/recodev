wip patch

the annotation policies implemented in bug 319455 execute against the date an annotation was created, instead of the last time it was modified. this is wrong.

attaching a wip patch. not quite there yet.

this causes annotations to be deleted before their time, so needs to make M7.

What is the normal policy for deletion? Is there a specific number of days that we can use for verification of this?
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
