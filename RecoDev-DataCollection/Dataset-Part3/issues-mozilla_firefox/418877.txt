It has been decided that for the Error/Warning/Information/Question (M3) set of icons we will use GTK stock icons:

Error: gtk-dialog-error
Information: gtk-dialog-info
Question: gtk-dialog-question
Warning: gtk-dialog-warning

We need to find all the places where we currently use a buildin icon and replace them with the right GTK icons. Mostly:

- Error/Warning pages/fav icons
- Notifications
- Error console

This shows a few places that need to be fixed, but there are many more... Hopefully someone can find a way to reliably find them all.

Console icon for error console

Let's cover the whole error console here. The old general/console/console-toolbar.png included error/warning/info/clear, which can all be used from gtk: gtk-dialog-error, gtk-dialog-warning, gtk-dialog-information, gtk-clear. The "main" icon is the only remaining icon on this bitmap (I don't think we need teh disabled state).
I include the winstripe results because in the case of "console.css", we need
to copy it from winstripe first.

gnometripe/global/findBar.css
gnomestripe/mozapps/update/updates.css
gnomestripe/browser/safebrowsing/browser-protection.css
winstripe/global/console/console.css
winstripe/mozapps/update/update.css
winstripe/mozapps/xpinstall/xpinstallConfirm.css
winstripe/global/config.css

Those files were found using error icons, info icons, blacklist icons, warning
icons

The only issue right now is that the "Page Load Error" icon that you see in the
location bar seems to be hardcoded (really hardcodes. src="data:image/png"
hardcoded)
Didn't you say earlier that the default gtk theme only produces those icons in dialog size? In that case would it be better to find more suitable stock icons for the 16x16 case, like gtk-info?
(In reply to comment #5)
> Didn't you say earlier that the default gtk theme only produces those icons in

This is correct. However, i have tested how those icons look when scaled down and found them to still look good enough. Alex Faaborg agreed with that. Note that icon themes like gnome-icon-theme or tango-icon-theme provide pixel-perfect versions for all the sizes.


ok, so before I go further, would it be reasonable to assume that the icon attached could be referenced via chrome://global/skin/console/console-large.png, or should I assume it will overwrite chrome://global/skin/console/console-toolbar.png?

Also, am I correct in assuming that we are just scaling down icons and no longer creating an entirely new set like previously thought?

Doesn't really matter... we can either just replace the current image or add the console icon with the new name and remove the old image.

> Also, am I correct in assuming that we are just scaling down icons and no

Yes. We would never be able to create a set of error/warning/etc icons that fit nicely with EVERY theme out there.
Note that only users that do not have any desktop icon theme set (fluxbox users for example) will ever see the scaled icons and I don't think they will really notice. Users of DEs like GNOME, Xfce, KDE4 etc will get all the required sizes from their theme.
What I am wondering most about is if I do "moz-icon://stock/gtk-dialog-error?size=menu" on a system without a gnome theme, will I get back a scaled down icon, or a full sized icon that I will have to scale?   Unforunately, I have a gnome theme so I've been unable to find a case where I have a large version of an icon but not a small version (even with the nonstandard icons)

I tested this... quit FF3. Select the default gnome theme as your icon theme, then do:

# mv /usr/share/icons/gnome /usr/share/icons/gnome-bak

Now start FF3, you should get the GTK fallback icons. You can test moz-icon://stock/gtk-dialog-error?size=menu from there.
Excellent. Turns out I get exactly what I want

Adds the use of Error, warning

This adds the correct icons to the error console, the about:config warning, the updates dialog, the find toolbar, and various extension notification bars.

The favicon for that error page is hardcoded into mozilla/docshell/resources/content/netError.xhtml, so I can't change it based on theme
Nice! But what about this hardcoded icon? The mac theme will run into the same problem I suppose...

roc isn't a valid reviewer of this.

Can we just override the chrome URL for extensions/question.png instead of doing the #ifdef everywhere?
I don't have the knowledge of the chrome to do that
I think it would be good to use gtk-execute on the error console's Evaluate button.
So I looked up how to do chrome overrides and I'm getting an error because it does not consider moz-icon://XXX as a local file (Possibly a bug I need to file, but will wait until tomorrow to see any replies)
Reed, since the chrome override doesn't seem like it's going to be possible, would you prefer I just had something like

#ifdef MOZ_WIDGET_GTK2
var notification_icon = "moz-icon://stock/gtk-dialog-info?size=menu";
#else
var notification_icon = "chrome://mozapps/skin/extensions/question.png";
#endif

somewhere appropriate towards the top of the code?
Just a little bump to get Reed's feedback on Comment #19
This will not block the final release of Firefox 3.
Mano / Gavin / Ryan: Do you know if there's a better way than what comment #19 says?
Here is a hopefully complete list of the occurrences of the icons.

OK, but must do we care about winstripe?

> OK, but must do we care about winstripe?

No, but this is different from the other 3 icons you mentioned in that it is used somewhere, so needs platform specific tests if it is to be removed from the tar.bz2. Error.png and Question.png got updated yesterday but there's no code to use them yet. I think warning.gif can be removed.

Ah, I see.
Hmm... this bug was marked blocking bug 418868, which has now been resolved? The Error/Warning/Information/Question are currently the most visible non-tango spots in the Linux builds, will this still make it into 3.0?
*** Bug 426508 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Can we split the changes to the error console off to a separate bug, using the Windows XP icons here really sticks out from all of the other tango icons.

However, until you get a new patch ready for just the question stuff, I'll leave this r?Ryan. :)
I just assumed a review- since it really shouldn't go in with those #ifdefs

Great, put it on that bug and ask for approval there.
Why? This bug needs the icon, too... I don't see a point in having multiple copies of the icon that might just become confusing later. The other bug clearly points to this bug for the icon and includes proper dependencies.
