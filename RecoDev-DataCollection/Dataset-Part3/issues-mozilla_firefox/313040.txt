We currently sign Windows executables with a signing key that labels the exe as
coming from "Mozilla Foundation".  From what I understand, we want this release
to be issued under the name "Mozilla Corporation".  We need to obtain a new key
from Thawte that has the corp in its common name.

This blocks the 1.8rc1 releases if we want those to be labeled as MoCo.
Missed RC1, but got the cert Nov 2 and hand-delivered to chase's signing machine in the server room Nov 3.
