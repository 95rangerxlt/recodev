In all other browsers except firefox 3 beta 2, when visiting Yahoo's sponsor search, I can not see any stats of mine. I thought they were down at first, then forgot i just installed this new BETA firefox.

What happens is, it will not start the information retrieval process using AJAX.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in on to yahoo sponsor search
2. look at dashboard
3. nothing shows up
Actual Results:  
The Stats and information should show up.

Expected Results:  
no stats or information
