1/ go to a ftp site with tar.gz archives like ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-l10n/

2/ search for a tar.gz file

expected result: there is an archive file in front of the file name

actual result: no icon, the alt text is displayed

The image is moz-icon://.zip?size=16
moz-icon://.tar.gz?size=16 does exists and works, this is what I would expect to see used actually

On Windows, both moz-icon://.tar.gz and moz-icon://.zip show an icon

Maybe the .zip version should be an alias for the tar.gz version and the alias is missing on Linux?

This is tested in 3.5.7 / 3.6 and Trunk, all official builds on Ubuntu 9.10

IMHO this should have been duped to Bug 521495, as Ubuntu's default icon theme uses SVG icons, revealing the issue.

The fix <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=418531> has been checked in on trunk only, but applies cleanly to mozilla-1.9.2 too.
This is working correctly on Ubuntu 11.04 and Firefox 5, consider closing?
yes, this is now fixed
