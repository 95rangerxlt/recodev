Please don't put files into browser/devtools/locales/en-US or something. Just use a folder within the browser/locales/en-US/ hierarchy?

In the l10n sources, the /locales/en-US/ part is dropped, so if you add stuff within browser/something, the en-US location becomes ambiguous from an l10n point of view.

I'd suggest to go for browser/locales/en-US/chrome/devtools or ...chrome/browser/devtools.
In browser/devtools there is a hierachy for each tool. I suggest we replicate that inside browser/locales/en-US/chrome/devtools.

We generally have a dtd and .properties file for each dev tool. Not sure there's value in having subfolders for each dev tool. Wouldn't it be sufficient to just put our dev tools dtd and properties files inside a single browser/locales/en-US/devtools folder?

webconsole has several already, but I'm not fussed. IMHO it would slow navigation down if we got more than 20/30 files in the one directory.
Sure, that works then. Subfolders it is.
Axel, in bug 656666 comment 14, you pointed out the cost in moving a strings file. Am I right in thinking that either we're doing this soon enough, or that the pain is worth it - i.e. that we should carry on ...
We're currently working on a patch to use:

    /browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/PROJECT

Where PROJECT is one of highlighter, scratchpad, shared, sourceeditor, styleinspector, webconsole, etc.

I think everyone is happy with this. Please shout ASAP if not.
The extra nesting of a directory-per-tool seems overkill. Won't most of them have only one or two files? Directories with 20-30 files (are there even that many now?) isn't particularly troublesome.

It's hard to know how many each will have - Perhaps 2 would be the norm, but it depends on how we split our tools up. I would hope that we grow our tools rather than adding many new ones, which indicates more than 2 files. webconsole is already at least 4 (probably more but it's hard to tell from a quick scan)

Whether 30 files is troublesome depends on your definition of troublesome I guess. Obviously is no problems with directory size or anything, but it is possibly slower to find what you're looking for.

I'm not particularly fussed however.
I prefer less nesting as a rule. ~30 files doesn't seem like too many to me, really.
OK, Ok, ok. Clearly outvoted. We'll go flatter.
Joe.

This patch moves all devtools strings to /browser/locales/en-US/chome/browser/devtools

It includes change to /mobile/chrome/content/content.js since it refers to headsUpDisplay.properties

Firefox Mobile can't access anything in /browser, since that code is not built for Firefox Mobile. We depend on toolkit code for "shared" resources.

Since we are only using a single string, let's just move the string to a /mobile properties file.

I really wish we had done this earlier, but in the long term, it's going to pay off.

We'll need noise around this, and mentors to help out, to deal with the fallout on the l10n community.

Can you recommend one to use? There are no obvious candidates.
My best guess is to leave a stripped out headsUpDisplay.properties in place containing just the 2 strings in question.

I'd recommend moving the string you need to /mobile rather than blocking this bug with an r-.

looks good.
PS, Mark, can you file a bug on your string migration and mark that is blocking this bug? We won't land until your move's complete. Hoping to get this landed by next week at the latest.

Mark: this implements my idea from comment 15 to keep the properties file in place stripped of the properties that you're not using.

I've r?ed Axel again because this changes the proposition.

We're keen to get one of these landed soon, but don't really care which way we do it.
Thanks.
I'm a bit lost, I'm afraid. What's this review request about in detail?
(In reply to Axel Hecht [:Pike] from comment #20)
> I'm a bit lost, I'm afraid. What's this review request about in detail?

It's about moving all devtools l10n strings to the same place. You've r+ed it once before (see comment 14). That patch moved all the files to the 'right' place, however some time ago mobile began to use devtools strings, so this patch would have broken mobile.

There were 2 options:
1. in a separate bug, mobile creates their own new strings file
2. we copy rather than move, and then strip out all but the 2 strings mobile are using from the original

This is a busy week for mobile, so in an attempt to get things moving, I did 2.

I r?ed you because this changes the way we do things.

OK. This will keep Fennec working. Thanks!

Looks good to me.

When we communicate about this, we should have a script that does the file moves/copies for an l10n repo in hand, too.

The change in this patch is basically that we just want to copy headsUpDisplay.properties for l10n, too.

We won't need to bother about removing the obsolete strings, that's something the localizers can probably safely do themselves.

Can you rename this file to webconsole.properties while you're at it?

I pushed to try just now, but there appears to be some bustage there.
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/5d250b1cf465

hopefully the bustage mentioned in Comment 27 is of the "try server is busted" variety.
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2541a2e898df
I'm trying to fix my locale after this (painful), but there's something I don't understand.

inspector.properties was last seen here
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/cd6ed3106521/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/inspector.properties

When moved to /devtools a new string appear (breadcrumbs.siblings)
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e43a54b52b06/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/inspector.properties#l10

I'm trying to understand in which bug this string was introduced (hg logs don't help).
Another thing (nitpicking): webconsole.properties vs webConsole.dtd
flod, breadcrumbs.siblings landed with bug 672006. They ended up in the same changeset together so I can see why that'd be confusing.

Please file bugs if you find anything odd, annoying or painful! thanks.
