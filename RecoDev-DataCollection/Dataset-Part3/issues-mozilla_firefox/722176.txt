Steps to reproduce:

I browsed almost all the bug reports about inline autocomplete and I don't think this one has been filled, but I'm not completely aware of inline autocomplete behavior/bugs. So maybe it's invalid.

STR:

0) Start with a new fresh profile for Nightly
1) Open a new tab
2) Type "nytimes.com" (without quotes) and press Enter
3) Open a 2nd new tab and close the previous tab
4) Type "ny" (NB: inline autocomplete works)
5) Delete the 1st entry (www.nytimes.com with favicon) OR the 2nd entry (nytimes.com without favicon) in location bar history
6) Open a 2nd new tab and close the previous tab
7) Type "ny" (NB: inline autocomplete doesn't work)

NB: opening/closing tabs in steps 3 & 6 is not necessary, but it's more clear like that.

I observed that with various domains, deleting an entry in location bar history for this domain, disable inline autocomplete for this domain.

Not sure if this is a bug, if you remove all the entries for a certain domain from history inline doesn't have anymore data to return.
So, after you remove the nytimes.com entry, do you still have any other nytimes.com entries in history?

In my STR in comment #0, I don't remove all the entries for nytimes.com domain, but just one entry in the location bar history.

See my snaphots of the location bar after steps 4, 5 and 7. In step 7, inline autocomplete becomes inactive.
ok, I think I figured this out as a bug in the delete trigger, doesn't check for 'www'. thanks.

As said the trigger was wrong. this includes a test for it.
I also replicated the same logic across other locations, since it's healthier.

not reversing host anymore? can you explain what's going on here?

also, should put the query bit into a shared string instead of duplicating around?

I'm not sure I got the question right, though I'll try to explain.
rev_host may be something like moc.allizom. or moc.allizom.www.
host can just be mozilla.com, though with this info I have to match either of the 2 above.
So get_unreversed_host (host || '.') returns moc.allizom, and to that I either append '.' or '.www.' to obtain the string I want.

I prefer not, since I want to be able to read the queries without having to parse them mentally with pieces coming from everywhere :)
