patch

All changes are summarized in the commit message.

Things I haven't tested yet:
- change "Unlink Browser" to "Disconnect", in both the prefs button and confirmation dialog title
- adjust string in the "Disconnect" confirmation dialog
- change "Device"->"computer" in the relink verification dialog
I think bug 966520 will help with my "FIXME" comment.

Nit: Nice apostrophe, should we replace others as well?

Should "Sync" be &syncBrand.shortName.label;?

1) Please use the other apostrophe.
2) &syncBrand.shortName.label; here too?

Technically one string changed without new ID, but I think the change is so minimal that it can be kept ("verification link" -> "link")

port changes to holly,

The cset not marked with 'Australis' (08ef155181f6) was also backed out of holly because it conflicted and broke the front-end freeze (it had some browser.xul bits that shouldn't be on holly). However, that leaves us in string hell. As far as I can tell, this patch should work on holly, but I don't know this code well at all. It's basically the same but minus the browser.dtd changes (whose strings don't exist), the browser.xul changes (which AFAICT were just for panels that don't exist on holly) and the browser-fxaccounts.js changes (which also doesn't exist on holly). Tim, can you doublecheck that hg (and I) did the right thing here?
Bad bzexport, bad.
