In bug 831720, a way to test Appcache manifest files was added to the GCLI, but a lot of strings are not OK for localize in other languages, like:

fallbackBlocksURI: FALLBACK section line %S (%S) prevents caching of line %S (%S) in the %S section.

I don't think all languages will keep the same structure than in English (Spanish does, but others do not).

If I am not mistaken, that should be changed to %1$S, %2$S, %3$S and so on…

I think you can use ordered arguments in your localization (see bug 834721 comment 6 and following), problem is knowing which parameter you're referring to with %1$S, %2$S, etc.

If that's the case explanative localization comments would be enough without changing the strings.
If that works, that's OK, but more than a comment on the string, we should need to send a mail to m.d.l10n making the clarification. I didn't know that I could exchange %S by %n$S to use as orderer parameters.

Let's see what Axel says. If I'm right I'll send the mail to m.d.l10n and also try to speak with the original committer to add some meaningful comments.
Yeah, you have to use one or the other within the string, but it doesn't need to match what en-US does.

We should talk about the l10n notes in webtools in general. They're very extensive, but not really solving the problem people are having when localizing.

In this case, they're telling a lot, but not what the placables in the string actually are.

The good thig is, as soon as you document the params, the docs get easier to write with ordered params, i.e. "%S is foo, %S is bar" is much harder to write than "%1$S is foo, %2$S is bar".

What if I use this file, which is pretty short, as a test to rewrite localization comments?

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/appcacheutils.properties

At least we could have a starting point for discussions.

Pike, does something like this makes sense to you?

For what I saw during these months, devtools tend to do a lot of copy and paste in their localization comments, sometimes even forgetting to change the name of the string addressed in the comment itself.

If this format is reasonable, I guess we should update the subject of this bug and involve a few developers (reviewers) from devtools.

Only glanced over this, and I like the direction. But this needs some more work.

For one, we should convert to numbered params, they just make better comments.
Also, the comments are shorter, which is great, but if you just start them with "The ..." page cache ..., you actually end up with English sentences, and that's worth a word.

Stylistic nit, some of the comments have trailing whitespace, which is generally frowned upon, you want to clean those up, too.

use %1$S etc here, both in the string and the comment.

Do we need new label IDs if I replace unordered parameters with numbered ones? My first answer would be yes, but it would turn in a nightmare for localizers (almost all strings as new). An alternative: send a message to dev.l10n warning them about the replacement and the possibility to have ordered params even if en-US doesn't have them.
Nope, as they're semantically equivalent.

Rewrite localization comments and use ordered arguments

This new patch should address all previous comments.

I tried to be consistent with this format and fixed a couple of typos in the original comments.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (stringname): some text. Parameters: some parameters.
There are issues in the following files:

appcacheutils.properties lots of issues
responsiveUI.properties 1 issue
webconsole.properties 2 issues

I didn't realize that it was possible to order the strings in this way. Is there anything else that we can do to make life easier for you guys?

I think the best thing is to find a suitable common template for localization comments and stick to ordered arguments.

In terms of comments gclicommands.properties will need a lot of attention.
You have also shortened the comments ... would you prefer short comments?

If they're short (but clear) they're usually easier to read, what it's not really needed (IMO) is the amount of repetition we currently have. See glicommands.properties for an example of that.

f=me with one nit, actually, I would recommend to use %S if there's just one string, and %1$S, %2$S etc if there are multiple.

This should go through a real review by a devtools peer, too.

Addressed nit (use %S when there's a single argument), asking for a developer's review this time.

Looks great, r+.

I will pass your comments on to the devtools team.
Thanks Michael, never realized we were almost in the same timezone :-)

I will probably try to look into other devtools files in the next days.
