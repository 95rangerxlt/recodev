Broken down from bug 860238.

I'm not sure if we want to record "reset" times or "migration" (from another Firefox profile) times.  The two technically aren't the same since theoretically migration from another Firefox profile could happen without a reset, maybe... but probably not in practice?

If we really need reset times, then it looks like times.json could be updated either by the front end: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/ResetProfile.jsm

Or the back end, somewhere around here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp?rev=5c930eeebcac#3959

If migration times are sufficient, then it should probably happen here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/migration/FirefoxProfileMigrator.js

But right now that only defines/overrides getResources(), which probably shouldn't have the side effect of changing a file.  So FirefoxProfileMigrator may need to also override migrate(), or something else.  MigratorPrototype in MigrationUtils.jsm should probably not be changed since it's used as the prototype for all types of migrators (i.e., migration from IE, Safari) and not only from other Firefox profiles.

But also note that it looks like the names of profiles that are created on reset are suffixed with a timestamp, so maybe writing to times.json isn't even necessary: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/xre/ProfileReset.cpp?rev=5a9badd6db00#34

Drew,
  Looking into this, it seems reasonably difficult to record meaningful "reset times".  When a new profile is created, a new times.json is created with the creation time.  This means that (a) any previous "reset times" have been lost, and (b) if we then write the time the reset happened it will be within a few ms of the actual creation time.

While it would be possible to do this if strictly necessary, my reading of bug 860238 is that simply recording a flag that the reset happened is OK and would meet the actual requirements.  Is it also your understanding that just storing a boolean in times.json is acceptable? (Or maybe to keep the filename correct, recording the same(-ish) timestamp as the creation time?)

ie, something like this.  I figured the migration code is a reasonable place to do this recording.

I think the idea is to write the reset time in the old profile's times.json (as outlined in comment 0), and then as part of the files that are migrated, copy that times.json over to the new profile.  This bug does the first part, bug 1063714 does the second.  Maybe there would need to be more logic telling Firefox not to overwrite the copied-over times.json with a new one.

So a profile would only be marked as having been created as either part of a reset or not?  That would mean that your reset "history" is lost -- rather, it only goes back one reset in time.  I was thinking that we should store the entire history, although I'm not sure whether that's actually reflected in the requirements in these bugs.

I broke down these FHR bugs starting from the plan in Richard's bug 860238 comment 1, which seems to indicate that FHR should record and report multiple reset times -- all of them I would say because that seems like interesting info.

I'll look at the patch next.

Yeah, this doesn't capture full reset history, right?  I would do something like this bug and bug 1063714 in combination suggest.  If it's easier to modify the new times.json instead of the old one, after copying over the old one (or at least its contents), no problem.

Actually, since we should record history as I've said, it makes sense to me to make times.json a list of timestamped events.  But maybe that would be inefficient when it comes time to use that data, depending on how we end up using it.  Although if it is a list, the whole thing could just be sent in the FHR payload without looking for needles in it.

So you think migration times are sufficient, as opposed to true reset times?

This patch now migrates times.json from the old profile to the new (so it is basically stealing a part of bug 1063714).  This way the creation time of the migrated profile is the same as the old profile.

This new patch records an (unbounded, sorted) array of migration times.  I'm not 100% sure that "(unbounded, sorted)" is actually desired, but I can't imagine it getting too large - maybe we should put an upper limit on the number we maintain?

> So you think migration times are sufficient, as opposed to true reset times?

Yeah, I think that's fine.  My understanding of the code is that a "reset" is really just a convenience wrapper for "make a brand new profile and swap it".  It is actually the migration code that makes the profile usable and thus is the *real* conceptual reset.

I've named the field in times.json |migrations| but given the above, I'd be comfortable with naming it |resets| - what do you think?

Benjamin: can you please confirm this behaviour is correct from your POV?  Specifically:

* A migrated profile now has the creation time of the original profile and not the time the new profile was technically created.
and:
* You (well, FHR) would like a list of migration/reset times, and clarify if you think we should put an upper limit on the number of times we record for a given profile?

FTR, in my testing I see times.json transition thusly:

original:
{"created":1411523590206}

first reset:
{"created":1411523590206,"migrations":[1411523806274]}

2nd reset:
{"created":1411523590206,"migrations":[1411523806274,1411523917307]}

3rd reset:
{"created":1411523590206,"migrations":[1411523806274,1411523917307,1411525192435]}

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This approach looks more like what I had in mind (not that that's right necessarily, but it seems right to me).  I can't imagine the list getting too large either, but IMO it's sound engineering to cap it anyway.  `migrations` is more accurate than `resets` IMO -- although migrations could also mean migrations from other browsers... so firefoxMigrations might be even better, but maybe that's pedantic.

I'd like to recap what I said above about keeping a single list of events.  If we did that, it'd be easy to add new types of events/times in the future.

I think that would be confusing in the opposite direction - we care to track resets, not profile migrations in general. That it's a "migration" under the hood is an unimportant implementation detail.
But Mark's patch doesn't technically track resets, it tracks migrations from other Firefox profiles.  That's what I was getting at in comment 0.

There is no useful distinction between "migrations form other Firefox profiles" and "resets". As far as I know there is no way to migrate from another Firefox profile apart from using the reset feature.

Given the discussion in bug 1063704, we are not tracking each reset time, just the most recent.  This patch reflects that (and note that it is on-top of the one in bug 1063714.(

gps, I'd like your feedback on the FHR parts here, specifically:

* That I had to increment the Metrics.Measurement version field due to adding a new field.

* That when there is no profile reset time, I simply decline to provide data for the new field.  I'm not sure if this is correct, or whether I should *always* include a value for the new field using (presumably) 0 as the value in that case.

* Any other FHR-specific stuff you notice :)

MattN: feel free to ignore this feedback request - I'm just flagging you as I expect to be asking you for review once gps is happy with the FHR stuff given adw is on leave.

I didn't follow the times discussion too much. As long as bsmedberg and/or Metrics is happy with the data we're getting (read: have someone f+ the measurement fields if you haven't already), I'll be happy to review the code.

When you create a new measurement version in FHR, you need to keep the old one around so that FHR will still report data from it. Otherwise, the data sits in the database and never makes it to the payload. It's totally fine to make the collection code not work for that version (just don't have the provider populate version <N. Just copy ProfileMetadataMeasurement to ProfileMetadataMeasurement2 and remove uses of the original and you'll be fine.

You'll need to update the in-tree docs about available measurements in services/healthreport/docs/dataformat.rst.

This looks mostly fine. So f+.

Um, the method is now called "recordProfileReset" (which is a better name IMO) so I guess this version wasn't tested ;) It would be good to add an automated migrator test for this like you did in bug 1063714.

Done, thanks.  I'd just like to check that the change:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I missed this before, but I think the storing of a single scalar "last reset day" field is limiting for data analysis. Wouldn't it be nice to know how often profile resets occur, for example? What about seeing if people reset Firefox multiple times because they are not happy with the result? Since we're copying the FHR data across resets, we can keep track of this in the database. All we need to do is write some daily data indicating that a profile reset occurred on that day. This can be either a last daily numeric field using "1" to signify a reset occurred, or it could be a daily counter that is incremented whenever a reset event occurs.

I think there is value in the current approach of recording the last reset day and we should do that regardless (data expires and having a persisted "this profile was reset at some time" helps us answer questions like "what percent of Firefox profiles have ever been reset." But I think recording every reset event is more powerful and answers much more questions to help us build a better Firefox.

If this were a normal patch, I'd say do a follow-up bug. But since this is FHR and we are incurring a version bump on the measurement and we try to limit preventable version bumps, I'm going to ask you to consider making the changes here and now.

Is that reasonable?

If you change this to FIELD_DAILY_LAST_NUMERIC or FIELD_DAILY_COUNTER and you ensure you are inserting a value on the proper day, you can magically now record *every* profile reset that ever occurs. This is *much* better than simply recording the last reset.
