Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

I created an addon to change color of urlbar based on encryption. however when i install an addon from mozilla addons site the notification box is exposing the backgoud color by 2px 


Actual results:

https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/addon/1018846/latest/


Expected results:

it should have covered the background completely. instead i had to run this code:
document.getElementById('notification-popup-box').style.marginLeft = '-2px'
