brettw points out that constructing statements by concatenating strings (which correspond to column values) is a bad idea, because you have to make sure the string is properly quoted.  It's better to just use parameters in the statement.

I only found two places where this was happening (one of them was already being quoted, but I changed it to a statement for consistency).

*** Bug 318434 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
