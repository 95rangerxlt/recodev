I had been using the official 1.0.7 tarball on Linux (x86) for quite a while without any problems. Two days ago, I upgraded to the official 1.5 tarball, and that's when this problem started. 

Whenever I highlight some text on any website, both the text and the background color get changed to the same shade of red, making the text completely unreadable. Here's an example:
http://netllama.linux-sxs.org/snapshot1.png

I've gone into Edit -> Preferences -> Content -> Colors, but no changes that I make there help at all. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.with your mouse highlight some text in either a web page or the URL/Location bar
2.the text color and the highlight color are identical, making it impossible to read the text


Actual Results:  
the text color and the highlight color are identical, making it impossible to read the text


Expected Results:  
the text color should be different than the highlight color, such that the text is readable.

Per http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html , setting moz-selection in UserContent.css does workaround this problem in web pages, however does not fix it for the URL/Location bar.

Lonni, 
do you see this now that bug 56314 is fixed (you must use a **trunk build*)?
**http://www.mozilla.org/developer/#builds 

if it's not gone, please attach your image to the bug - your link is no longer valid.
Can you point me to where I can get a trunk build that includes this fix?
It seems to be fixed in the trunk build, however all of my themes & extensions were marked as incompatible in that build, so I don't know how useful of a test this was.
do you have the problem if you start FF 1.5 in safe mode - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_mode

please comment if you can about:
bug 255941 comment 18?
bug 293287?

Created attachment 237573
screenshot of the problem

see the address bar for the bad color problem
I've attached a screenshot of the problem.  See the highlighting of the URL in the addressbar.

This problem does persist in 1.5.0.6 in -safe-mode, so perhaps it is fixed in the latest trunk build.

Bug 293287 sounds somewhat similar to my problem, but not exactly the same.
Lonni, please retest with FF2 and close if gone
Yes, its fixed, thanks.
