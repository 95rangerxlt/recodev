I found a little thing in ~mozilla-TRUNK\browser\locales\en-US\chrome\browser\places\places.dtd.
The entity "view.columns.label" has a double entry on line #25 and #329.
Localizations fail on this one.

Wim, thanks for spotting this.

Kurt, any interest in taking this one?

Is it alright if I give view.details.accesskey a letter also in this bug...that way there isn't a bunch of bugs/patches for small things? If so can you suggest a letter?

<!ENTITY view.details.accesskey    "">



kurt, let's start a new bug on the accesskey issue.

note, in places.xul, we have:

accesskey="&view.details.label;">

which should be view.details.accesskey

see bug #396733
Ehan, do you want to fix this one also?  I will in about two hours if you don't want to.
Yeah.  BTW, you missed an "s" in my name!  :-)
Thanks.  Yeah sorry about that, I noticed after hitting the commit button.

Trivial fix
dietrich added this item for bug #387740, so as soon as we figure out if it should be "Columns" or "Show Columns", we'll know which one to remove.

dietrich / faaborg, can you clarify?
*** Bug 397075 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Given that every mockup and discussion in the bug used Show Columns rather than Columms, I'd certainly expect that that was what was intended. And given that this has turned every locale's tinderbox a glaring shade of orange, I think blocker was a more appropriate severity (though, it sort of looks like the main l10n tinderbox lies when it says that non-success builds won't be uploaded). And given that it would be nice for localizers to at least know there is a bug filed, adding a whole cartload of watchers to the cc list :)
went with "Show Columns", thanks Phil.  

(I didn't see a mockup with that, but I did see "Show Columns" in a comment from faaborg.)

fixed, thanks Ehsan.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.

Gerv
