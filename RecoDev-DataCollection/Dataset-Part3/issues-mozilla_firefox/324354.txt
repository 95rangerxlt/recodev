After clearing all private data (Ctrl-Shift-Del, checking all boxes), you can select either the URL address bar or the built in search bar and hit Ctrl-Z.  This will cycle through all of the previously visited addresses even though I have already cleared all history.  This works in both the URL and search fields.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a few web sites and/or make a few searches from the built in search bar.
2. Clear all private data (Ctrl-Shift-Del)
3. Select either the URL address bar or the search bar.
4. Hit Ctrl-Z to repeatedly cycle through previously viewed URLs and/or search requests.

Actual Results:  
I can see all previously viewed URLs.

Expected Results:  
I see nothing since I've already cleared all private data.

I don't know if this is a Firefox 1.5 problem or an OS problem.  I'm running WinXP SP2 with all updates.

I guess I'm responsible for this.
There's a known problem where "clear private data" doesn't clear session history (back-forward buttons) for which the workaround is to open a new tab (or window) and close the old one. This has a similar workaround: close the current window to clear the edit history stored in the address widget.

Sanitize Browsing History should zap the location bar undo history in all open browser windows. Sanitize Form Data should do the same for the undo history of the search box.
I don't think fixing bug 158071 is responsible. We want that bug to remain fixed, we want Sanitize to take proactive steps to tell these edit boxes to forget their undo history.

so I guess the patch has to be something like this.
Does the patch fix the search bar and the URL bar, or just the URL bar?
(In reply to comment #5)
> Does the patch fix the search bar and the URL bar, or just the URL bar?

It depends on which boxes are checked when clearing data.  If "Browsing History" is checked, then the URL bar history should be cleared.  If "Saved Form Information" is checked, then the search bar history should be cleared.

No, it just fixes the URL Bar, I concentrated on what I regressed.
I'll see what I can do for the search bar.

Ok, this patch is actually good. It also takes care of clearing the undo history of the search bar (which was actually something I regressed after all).
If bug 312867 would be fixed in Firefox, then I would not need to QueryInterface for the editor with the searchbar (for the urlbar, it's somehow working already).

Apostrophitis: its undo history.

>(for the urlbar, it's somehow working already).
I guess as a result of the newline stripping patch.

I just landed the patch for that bug (exposing "editor").

You can just use "this.mOuter.editor", given the patch in the other bug, no?
Same comment for the other ones (gURLBar.editor and searchBar.mTextbox.editor).

Just mTextbox.value?

^^^ What happens when enableUndo() has already been set to false? Wouldn't this set it to true (maybe causing something else to mess up)? I'm not sure if this would ever happen or cause a real problem, but I thought I should bring it up.
I am unaware of any situation where we support, or care about, a case where someone has disabled undo in the URL bar or search textboxes.
Well, maybe a special xul attribute (disableundo="true" or something) could be created, so it would be easy to keep track of this.
But I doubt if it would used much.
Doesn't look like this was really wanted in 1.8.0, and it's too late now for .0.2 for a bug that isn't fixing a critical security hole. If you still want this for the 1.8.0 branch please nominate for 1.8.0.3 and request approval on the patch.
