breaks make install.
I've noticed that I need to copy application.ini as well as
platform.ini to the target directory.  Have you seen this?

Also, 'make install' generate an extra step which should not
be there:
/usr/src/tb/mozilla/obj/config/nsinstall -R -m 644  /usr/local/lib/thunderbird-3.0a1pre

No file is named in that line, which is a syntax error. I've
been trying to find the source of that extra line, but so 
far I'm defeated.  Have you seen this error?

Thanks.

platform.ini will be installed by this patch.

for application.ini i have prepared a patch against config/rules.mk which I will open a new bug for once my tests succeed.

fwiw, this bug is about that build failure ;) ... try the patch.
ok i added depends on bug 386904 ... which tracks the application.ini issue.
Okay, my only nit is that $(SYSINSTALL) should be used instead of $(INSTALL).
Otherwise a symlink to platform.ini gets installed instead of the file.

Thanks!

SYSINSTALL platform.ini

good catch. This one does sysinstall.
