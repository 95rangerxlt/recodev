Patch to add he/ka/ku to Firefox 2.0.0.1 shipped-locales
Landed:

Checking in shipped-locales;
/cvsroot/mozilla/browser/locales/Attic/shipped-locales,v  <--  shipped-locales
new revision: 1.1.4.13; previous revision: 1.1.4.12

Darn, talking to reed on irc, I realize that I forgot about pa-IN once again. It's always showing up in my post-thread mails, not for the first time in discussing 2.0.0.1. Bah. See bug 357246 for my tracking, new locales for release are he and pa-IN, though that bug does not include the beta locales, ka and ku.

The regressions that made pa-IN not ship for 2.0 are fixed for quite some time, so that should go back on. No platform specifications, per bug 353341 comment 5, as opposed to what we do on 1.8.0. Thus merely

+ pa-IN

Patch to add pa-IN to Firefox 2.0.0.1 shippied-locales

Per the above comment, this patch adds pa-IN to shipped-locales. This should be applied to the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH branch.

Also, after this is landed, the FIREFOX_2_0_0_1_RELEASE tag needs to be moved for this file and the l10n locales respun.

> be locale is forgotten also.

be wasn't in the list of shipped-locales for 2.0.0.1; if it's ready, please let Axel know, and we'll get it on the list for 2.0.0.2.

TR: can we resolve this bug?
