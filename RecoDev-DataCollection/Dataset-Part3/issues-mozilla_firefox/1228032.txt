STR:
1. Open devtools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Click "Show in separate window" button

Result:       
 Toolbox opens in separate window, but there's no close and resize buttons, no title,
 and there's no way to resize, move or close it.

Expectations: 
 The window should look like it used to, or at least: there should be a way to view window title,
 to resize, move and close the window.

It was regressed between 2015-11-23 and 2015-11-24, probably by bug 1226570:

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Not sure I'll get to this before PTO, but we should definitely take a look at this.
If I open browser toolbox, which is also broken, open frame "toolbox-window.xul" then create a new stylesheet with CSS from chrome://browser/skin/browser.css - then everything's OK.
Looking at the changes made in bug 1226570, probably the goal was to _replace_ stylesheets link, not remove them completely? Currently toolbox window looks as if "-moz-appearance:none" was applied
I'm pretty sure you want to have chrome://global/skin/[global.css] as a stylesheet for all of these, or you will have a Bad Time.
I can't repro this on mac. Is it windows only?

Okay, since you've confirmed this fixes the issue, we can go with this.

I **believe** we only actually need this in the `toolbox-*-window.xul` files, though.
Tree's closed, and I need to go sleep.

I believe the same thing, but I'd rather find out after fixing this for the upcoming nightly. Of course, with the tree closed it's difficult to make sure that happens...
