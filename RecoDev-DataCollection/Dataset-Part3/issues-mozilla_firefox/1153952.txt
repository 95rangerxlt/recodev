Attached patch fixes button sizing bug by adding sdk-button=true to the social buttons.  However, IMO it would be better to have a constrain-size=true attribute in case anyone decides to use sdk-button for something in the future (I am not certain whether there is some code out there looking for buttons with sdk-button=true).

I'm not sure if this could cause trouble in the future. Probably best to get feedback from SDK people too.

Oh, yeah, thanks for removing this too.

Matteo, do you see any current or speculative problem with the social buttons using the sdk-button attribute?
The current use we have for "sdk-button" is actually only for the size, so I don't see any problem to use it atm, however I agreed that would be better having something like `constrain-size`, and then refactoring the SDK part too – I can take care of that.

However, it seems to me that we have a regression, since if I create a button via SDK, and I set a larger  image (e.g. 512x512), the button will be huge instead of be resized.

Should we change sdk-button everywhere to constrain-size?  Or do you want both attributes?

I beleive that would be bug 1153243.

I would say having just `constrain-size` would be better. Unless someone else wants to have a SDK specific attribute for some reason, I'm in favor of having just one generic attribute, like the one you suggested.

This changes sdk-button to constrain-size, and uses that for both sdk and social buttons.

Looks good to me, but the SDK changes needs a separate PR to http://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk, that is main repo – any changes made directly to firefox source code will be overwritten in the next uplift, I'm afraid.

Ok, I'll remove that part of the patch, can you submit that to the addon-sdk repo?
Actually, I'll leave that part in for now, and addon-sdk can get the update hopefully prior to the next uplift.

Not sure if this change need a review Erik, but just to play safe. It's really a quick one. :)

We generally assume that if code has already been reviewed and landed in m-c then the uplift to github doesn't need a review.

Bug 1153952 - social buttons are too large

 - Updated the sdk specific attribute to the new more generic `constrain-size`, to have the buttons that fits the toolbar and the panel.
