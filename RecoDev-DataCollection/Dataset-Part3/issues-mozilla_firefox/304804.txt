Bill's comments: "The current GOK behavior is not quite correct.  Both Mozilla
and Firefox are unusual among applications in having their menus inside a
toolbar.  Logic was added to GOK to accomodate this case, specifically for
Mozilla.  Since Firefox changes the behavior a little, the GOK code for
detecting Mozilla menus fails."

Bill has provide a patch for GOK and will be integrated in GOK head soon. So
Close this bug.
