Test case demonstrating the problem

The only RESULTS_AS setting that works for Bookmark queries is RESULTS_AS_URI.  For everything else, no results are returned in the result set.  

I'll attach a test that demonstrates this behavior. 

= Expected Behavior =
The results as queries should work for bookmarks too, the RESULTS_AS_DATE* should work if the bookmarks have a visit associated with them, the RESULTS_AS_SITE should always work since bookmarks have URIs associated with them.

= Actual = 
Only RESULTS_AS_URI returns any results for a bookmark query.

add idl notes

this is true, our code actually does not allow grouping bookmarks, the idl does not say anything about that, so i'm going to add notes to the idl, and this should be fixed in future if possible adding support for more complex queries (rewriting the query builder class could make this easier).

please file a bug for this change, and make it block the query-builder-rewrite bug.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
