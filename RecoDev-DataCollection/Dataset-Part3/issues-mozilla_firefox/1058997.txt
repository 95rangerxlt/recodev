Before I implement the TLS debugger sockets work for WiFi debugging, I think it will be clearer if we isolate the code handling sockets on either end to a single place.

Then, I'll extend these objects with secure versions.

Panos, the main theme of this work to extract the debugger's socket related code for future extension to TLS sockets.  It also enables easier comprehension about debugger socket security, since there is less code to worry about in a smaller file.

This is my first time posting multiple commits with MozReview, so let me know if there issues!  After you click one link in this bug to MozReview, I would strongly suggest clicking each of the "/r/439" style links next to each of the commits in the "Description" box.  That will allow you to see a diff from each commit.  The initial link is a "parent" review, which presents all of the changes from all the commits, which could be hard to review.

See the user guide[1] for more details on the MozReview features as a reviewer.  Also, if you can't login to MozReview and you use Persona with Bugzilla, check my comment[2] about this.
