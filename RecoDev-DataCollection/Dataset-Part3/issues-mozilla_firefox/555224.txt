the following seems to fix the issue .
In FullZoom.onLocationChange in browser.js

    // Avoid the cps roundtrip and apply the default/global pref.
    if (aURI.spec == "about:blank") {
-      this._applyPrefToSetting();
+      this._applyPrefToSetting(undefined , aBrowser);
      return;
    }
Can confirm that this is always reproducible. Using win7 64it, build details below:

Doh. onLocationChange gives us the background browser for this case while calling _applyPrefToSetting with both parameters undefined acts on the foreground browser...

As it's already been reviewed, it no longer needs my review, so cancelling the request.

Sorry I didn't get to this before you found review elsewhere! :-/
