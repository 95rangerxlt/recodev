[checked-in] Proposed patch.

Currently, the Console provides no visual indication of what the filter field is for. The attached patch fixes this, by providing placeholder text for it.

This patch is part of the Firefox 4 Console UI. The current UI for the console
is simply a placeholder and has not yet been designed from a UX perspective
(see bug 559481). Because I am requesting blocking status for the Console UI,
and this is a critical part of the Console user experience, I am requesting
that this bug block the Firefox 4 release as well.

Needs checkin. Should apply cleanly on trunk except for the header (since my name was added in changeset 7ca4b43c3210).
Doesn't block, but patch approved.
(another accident, not a great bugzilla morning!)
