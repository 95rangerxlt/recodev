Fixed in https://github.com/tobytailor/shumway/commit/82d21614a711c768bfed08a789931df4b9aba757.
Reverted by https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/1705 due to regression
I opened a PR with a different solution for this:
https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/1716

Yury, can you say if that resolves the regression you saw?

Tobias, what do you think of this? I think it should fully work, but I might very well be overlooking something.

Reftests looks fine, so there is no such regression.
Looks pretty fine to me (and much better than my solution). Giving green lights for merging.
