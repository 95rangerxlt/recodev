Trying out the "Share this page" button, the resulting popup looks quite broken (see screenshot). Hovering over the blank spaces reveals (from the tooltip) that icons are missing for Twitter, Google, etc. Maybe it's assumed a favicon is available when it actually needn't be?

Hmm, the icons should be embedded in the page as data urls.  What locale is your browser?  If en-US you could directly view that page here:

https://activations.cdn.mozilla.net/en-US/sharePanel.html
@aleth, do you have any ad/script/etc blocking?  If so, can you try disabling them and see if that is the issue?

Good guess, looks like disabling ABP on https://activations.cdn.mozilla.net/en-US/sharePanel.html resolves the issue.
ok, I can try a few things and see if there is a way to deal with that.  

Do you have a default configuration of ABP, or did change anything (list used, etc)?
It's fairly default. I have the social blocking list enabled, which contains whatever filters are blocking the icons, but that's in the top three of default filter list options.
ABP seems fairly broken in 41, prefs don't stick when I change them, cant get into a filter list, no toolbar button anywhere to be found :(

Yes, only their 'nightly' version works.
This should be fixed on my dev server, could you verify?
