Sometimes, when I start typing in a text box (such as the one I am using now) the cursor may disappear and I when I look up from the keyboard, I have not typed much.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:

The cursor disappears

This is getting ridiculous!
It is now happening to selection boxes
Works with this text box here on Mozilla's bugzilla. Is there a particular url it's happening with?

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008072302 Minefield/3.1a1pre
It is happening with all text boxes
Please try to stay a bit pro when you report a bug "This is getting ridiculous!" won't help at all.
Then detailed steps ("I have not typed much" is extremely unclear), a URL and a screenshot would help a lot. 
Do you have the same with FF3.0.1, a new profile ?
I found some reports that sounds identical on FF2.0.x.
Cannot reproduce on bugzilla.mozilla.org with PPC 10.5 - FF3.0.1
It seems to have stopped now. It may have been a theme specific thing but I do not know how it happened.
I have been experiencing this problem on both my laptop and desktop for about a week. So far, it happened three times while writing this. Five just now. I have FF3.01 on Windows XP
