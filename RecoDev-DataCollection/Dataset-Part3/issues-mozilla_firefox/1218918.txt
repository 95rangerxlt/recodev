Steps:

1) Enable "work offline" in devtools.
2) Note pages no longer can load from network.
3) Disable "work offline" in devtools.
4) Note pages can once again load from network.
5) Disable network interface (ethernet on my wind8.1 desktop machine)
6) Note pages no longer can load from network
7) Enable network interface
8) Note pages can once again load from network
9) Enable "work offline" in devtools

Expected:

After step 9, pages should be blocked from the network again.

Actual:

After step 9 I am able to load pages from the network even though "work offline" is checked.  Some time later, after leaving browser idle it begins blocking network again.

By work offline, are we talking about the setting in the Firefox menu bar, or something inside the DevTools toolbox?

I did Hamburger -> Developer -> Work Offline.
Ah okay, I did not realize it was shown there!  The DevTools has not done much with feature in the past.  It toggles `Services.io.workOffline`, and the behavior from there is managed by the networking code.

:mayhemer, do you know who could look into something like this?
Patrick, can you please forward to the right person?  Thanks.

Issues with devtools "work offline" when connectivity changes

* Flip the network.offline-mirrors-connectivity pref, so that ioservice.offline means the same as devtools work offline
* ioService.manageOfflineStatus shouldn't be changed when going to offline mode.
* Add logging to nsIOService in order to track offline/connectivity issues

Issues with devtools "work offline" when connectivity changes

This bug occurs for 2 reasons:
1. network.offline-mirrors-connectivity was set to true, in order not to break previous assumptions about ioservice.offline. However, this led to the odd situation in which setting ioservice.offline to true did not always cause it to be true, because the getter also took connectivity into account.
2. when calling toggleOfflineStatus, it would set ioService.manageOfflineStatus to false, which effectively disables our connectivity detection. This should only be changed via the preference, if the user wants to do so.
