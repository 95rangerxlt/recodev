I have a couple of extensions installed that use the new sdk pane api, and I can no longer disable enable them with today's nightly. The error is:

System JS : ERROR resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource:///modules/devtools/framework/toolbox-options.js:55 - Error: Unknown type

( I also have the ember extension installed, and it can be enabled / disabled just fine )
I'm guessing that since tool.visibilityswitch is not a known pref (something like "devtools.foo.enabled") it is failing to set it.  The ember extension probably works because you had already installed it and toggled it, initializing the pref before this bug was introduced.  Most likely we just need to *not* call SetPref when a tool enable/disable checkbox is pressed, and instead just call Services.prefs.setBoolPref directly.

Looks good to me.
My only comment is that, while we're at it, we might as well change the test a little more to:
- add a comment at the top explaining what the test is supposed to be testing
- make use of asyncTest which exists in head.js in this directory to simplify a bit the test
