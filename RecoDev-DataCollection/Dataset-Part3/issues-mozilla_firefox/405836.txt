When viewing a print preview for multiple pages, the next page / previous page buttons do not work correctly. When pressing the next page button, the preview advances to the last page, when pressing the previous page button, the preview advances to the first page. In both cases, the actual page number shown in the toolbar is correct but the page displayed is incorrect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a long web page (more than 3-4 pages of print)
2. Open print preview
3. Click on next page button - preview advances to last page
4. Click on previous page button - preview advances to first page
Actual Results:  
Shows incorrect page in the preview pane.

Expected Results:  
Clicking on next / previous should display the correct page in the preview pane.

Not fixed in Beta2
Not reproducible for me in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008031004 Minefield/3.0b5pre, on Windows XP
I opened some wikipedia page (for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA/ click on File - Print Preview and next page button/previous page button display the correct page in the preview pane.

Im using Beta 3 and 4 and both print preview buttons work fine.
Seems to be fixed in Beta 3 & Beta 4... will mark as resolved.
