With the build from 081209 there is a regression for displaying the preview of Web feeds directly inside the browser. Sometimes the output isn't styled by using the native XSL style. Instead the RSS/Atom feed is displayed in raw format. When this is happening following error is shown inside the Error Console:

Error: Failed to init microsummary service:
[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570016
(NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]"  nsresult:
"0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: anonymous :: line 1233"  data: no]
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 1235

Currently I'm only able to see it on OS X. On Windows it works quiet well. Here are the steps you have to do to see the mentioned issue:

1. Start Firefox with a clean session
2. Enable Session Restore to use the last session on startup
3. Open the given URL and restart Firefox

With step 3 the formerly correctly displayed Web feed is displayed without applying the native XSL style.

The regression starts between the builds 081208 and 081209. Checkins for this
time frame: http://tinyurl.com/96pevb. I'm not sure which check-in could have been caused this problem. I'll try to narrow it down.

Shawn, could this bug be somehow related to your patch on bug 466582?

Clicking on the RSS icon inside the location bar results in using the feeds protocol instead of using the HTTP one:

feed://http//planet.mozilla.org/atom.xml
I highly doubt it.  In fact I'd be quite surprised if it did
This has been fixed on trunk between the builds 08122402 and 08122502: http://tinyurl.com/9pr3q6. But it's still there for the latest Shiretoko build.

Ted, could this have been fixed by one of your checkins on bug 462004, bug 467862, or bug 469814?
I tried to reproduce this issue with my debug build but I'm not able to. Only by using official nightly builds I see the unformatted output. Could it happen because of using static vs. shared libraries?
Note that if you visit about:buildconfig in each build, you can find the exact changeset they're built from, and then you can get a regression range like:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=foo&tochange=bar
That's a cool I haven't known yet. Thanks Ted! Here the list of checked-in patches in this time frame:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=df94feb90a4f&tochange=5428595e217c
Bug 469814 is OSX-only, seems suspicious given comment 4, though that patch removes library links ...
Do we use the same .mozconfig for tryserver builds as we have for releases/nightlies? If yes, I could start a build with the patch on bug 469814 to see if it fixes the problem for Shiretoko.
I've downloaded the .mozconfig for official nightly builds but I'm not able to reproduce this issue with a local 1.9.1 build. Is there anything I've to obey for building?
(In reply to comment #9)

To reproduce bug 469814 locally, you need to call:
 make -C objdir buildsymbols
Florian, do I have to call it once? I already did that and started Shiretoko afterwards but there is no difference. It's still working for my local build.
If this bug is actually the same problem that I had before filing bug 469814, you have to build the symbols before the XPCOM registration (so before starting your build for the first time, or with a new profile), and the problem only occurs after a restart.
Ok, good news. This bug has been fixed between 090102 and 090103. Possible related check-ins:

http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/pushloghtml?fromchange=067649fefb8d&tochange=fef0ad965b31

Ted, I highly suspect that this is a regression from bug 421534 and was fixed by bug 469814. The same check-in on bug 469814 for m-c fixed it here too.
What is kinda strange, it works now even with left-overs of dSYM bundles located in the updated Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20090103 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre ID:20090103020545
