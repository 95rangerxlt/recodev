After clearing browsing history which had not been cleared in a long while (sorry, no details on how large it was), FF 3.6.8 repeatedly crashes, usually within 2 minutes, regardless of url, restarting, rebooting, disabling addons, ect.
After browsing my crashes on /crash-stats.mozilla.com, seems that all of my crashes were related to sqlite3VdbeExec.  Upon further research looking at sdwilsh comments for bug 523405 at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=523405#c14 I linked my clearing of the browsing history as the possible cause, and deleted my places.sqlite, which fixed the crashing problem - So this might be a continuation of this problem or some other sqlite file corruption issue.  I haven't tried to reproduce, because I assumed this had to do with the buildup of the places.sqlite over a long period of time.
It ranks as 29 for now.  http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/list?range_value=2&range_unit=weeks&date=2010-08-27%2010%3A00%3A00&signature=sqlite3VdbeExec&version=Firefox%3A3.6.8

Reproducible: Didn't try

1.Clear recent history, browsing & download history

There's also bug 581946. Do you happen to still have the broken places.sqlite? Could you post the crash IDs?

sdwilsh, could this be useful?

> sdwilsh, could this be useful?
Yes, getting a copy of the broken places.sqlite is very useful if it's a reproducable crash.  I an give it to the SQLite developers so they can see how 1) the file got that way and 2) make it so it doesn't ever crash that way.
Shawn, I meant without the broken places.sqlite can this bug be useful otherwise?

Shad, do you have the broken places.sqlite, or did you actually delete it?

Oh, no it's not so useful without it.
Alas, no, fixed the problem by deleting (shift-delete habit) the places.sqlite - I didn't think to rename/back it up.  Perhaps in the future somebody reading this bug with the same problem can do that, or reproduce the error by building places.sqlite up to the size of the corrupted file, if size is even a factor.  
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Locked_or_damaged_places.sqlite might be updated to reflect backing up the places.sqlite file, getting the file size or attaching it and submitting a bug report to aid in collections of corrupted sqlite files.
You might have a hard time collecting places.sqlite as it might be seen as a privacy issue.  I'm not familiar with how mozilla verifies the integrity of the file before processing, but a further look at it might be a solution, as all sorts of things can cause it (filesystem corruption, plugins, mozilla crashing for other reasons, ect)
To add - I did have SQLite Manager plugin installed and recently updated prior to the corruption, but I have never used it to look at places.sqlite or any mozilla files.
Got a places.sqlite file from another user which I have passed on to the SQLite team for them to take a look at.
And they already have a fix in hand for this.  We should get this fix when we upgrade to SQLite 3.7.3.
Correction - this was fixed in SQLite 3.7.1.
Which also means that this fix made it in for b5.
