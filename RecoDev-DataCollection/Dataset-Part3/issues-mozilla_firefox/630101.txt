I see this on Windows too in tip of tree and beta 10.

This seems to depend upon bug 624311.
what is your homepage set to? What page opens when you open a new tab? about:blank or the default homepage?

thanks for the report, we'll look into it.
able to reproduce this with my home page set to about:blank.

Sounds like this is a bug for the about:blank page - right?
(aside to Frank Yan, I think that bug is specific to that prerelease.html page)

I think we need to detect if we're on a blank page in our autocomplete code and not try to match any properties or methods if we're there. This isn't really a DOM problem.
This appears to have been fixed for awhile. Closing.
