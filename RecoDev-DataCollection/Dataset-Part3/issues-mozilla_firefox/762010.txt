STR:
1) Open http://antennmarket.ru/files/S21manual.pdf
2) Notice "Open With Different Viewer" button in top right corner of pdf page
3) Notice hardcoded "U" accesskey in "Open With Different Viewer" (see screenshot)

Looking at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/extensions/pdfjs/components/PdfStreamConverter.js#209 it sound like there should be accesskey for open_with_different_viewer. But http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/pdfviewer/chrome.properties doesn't contain one.

CC'ing Pike as Bug 742099 has landed on Aurora.

Sorry, I don't understand the code paths at all, I'm not a good review for this.
Brendan: is this something that was upstreamed and that we'll pick up in the next pdf.js code drop?
Gavin: Yes, this will be included. I'll be opening a new bug to update the code today.
Fixed by the pdf.js ff16 update.
