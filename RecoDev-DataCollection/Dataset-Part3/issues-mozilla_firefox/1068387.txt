hi Luís, your Puzzle Piece add-on seems to be broken with multiprocess Firefox (e10s). If you have any questions about e10s support, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
The latest beta version (1.4b*) in the development channel should already work fine in e10s. Just haven't released it yet because there's a few more bugs to fix and new features I want to implement for the next version, which I'm already working on. So, should be soon.
Awesome! Thanks, Luís.

I'll leave this Firefox bug open as a reminder for the e10s team to test the new version.

I believe that is for Video Resumer, not The Puzzle Piece.
I attached error log with all my addons switched on just to check if everything going right with "Puzzle 1.4b" 

Previously I thought that FT DeepDark 11.3.1 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ft-deepdark/) has incompatibility with Puzzle,but nothing happens with the native skin as well.
The new version of Puzzle Toolbars (The Puzzle Piece) has been approved and is now publicly available. It is (or should be) completely compatible with e10s.
Awesome! Thanks, Luís. :)
