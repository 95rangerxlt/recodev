Panorama needs it for app tab support (bug 593871). 

zpao has already written some code for this: 

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=469553&action=diff#a/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml_sec1

... though we don't need the aSecondary stuff, just the 6 event lines. 

Drop it in, add a test, and r? dao.

When I hear "TabPin" it's not obvious to me that "pin" is a verb. Would have preferred "TabPinned".
