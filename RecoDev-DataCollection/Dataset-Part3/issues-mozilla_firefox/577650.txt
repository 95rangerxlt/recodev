Created attachment 456564
v1

+ Create two groups; one with a single tab and another with several
tabs. Go into the single tab and then close the tab. You return to the
TabCandy interface as you should, but you see one of the other tabs
zooming out. There should be no zoom out in this case. [RAYMOND]
+ Cmd+e key combination is not working in the tab candy.
+ close buttons on tabs are still not showing correctly.  Add a bunch
of tabs to the tabstrip so all close buttons for background tabs are
hidden, go into Tab Candy interface and remove tabs until you know the
close buttons should appear.  Then, zoom into a tab and the close
buttons on back
