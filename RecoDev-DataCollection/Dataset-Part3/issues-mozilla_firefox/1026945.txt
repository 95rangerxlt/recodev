Where's a good place to hook this in?  I need something similar for WiFi, but I think for that case I may only want to scan when the runtime popup is opened...?  Perhaps ADB vs. WiFi will take different approaches, just something to think about.

When we start the App Manager?
Or even only when the panel shows up.

We should start ADB when we open the panel, and stop it when closed. I believe it would solve bug 1031229.
This is quite annoying, because I always have to mentally filter out the ADB stuff from the terminal logs when debugging. Whoever fixes this gets a free beverage of their choosing from me in the next work week!

Paul silenced some of the logs recently... but it seems some are still around.  Filed bug 1060148 to clean those up.

Looks good, just see my comment about fastboot.
Hmm, but I bet the fastboot add-on also wants ADB devices too, to detect your device and reboot it into fastboot mode if needed.

:gerard-majax, any thoughts here?  We'd like to avoid starting the ADB server, etc. until we know it's needed.  For WebIDE, we have a flag we can check to see if WebIDE has been used.  But, that makes things harder for your own installer add-on.  Any ideas on a good way to delay starting ADB / fastboot that also works for your use case?

I don't understand anything: how WebIDE will detect ADB devices in this case?
I'm relying on Devices to play with ADB and Fastboot. For fastboot we do polling and the addon initiates it.
Okay, I think I will rework this as :gerard-majax suggested, so that WebIDE signals to the add-on that's it's time to start, instead of the add-on depending on WebIDE.

This way, it's more flexible for other consumers to start / stop for ADB / fastboot.

Okay, I am now waiting for events like the fastboot case.

This means we'll have to require Firefox 41+ for the new add-on version, since only those Firefoxes have WebIDE which knows the add-on is lazy.
For Firefox change:

See my comment about keeping FF41- compatibility.
I hope that makes sense and we can prevent breaking it.

Alex, could you sanity check my changes for 41 and earlier?  (The lazy loading support landed as part of Firefox 42.)
Here's the interesting block:

We should still support FF38. I think that's fine to keep running adb there, instead of breaking support on the current release.
Updated per comments in PR.  I have tested that ADB works on: 38, 40, and 42, which covers all ways of starting ADB.
