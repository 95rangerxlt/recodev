In the place window, separators have a "document" icon overlaid over it (see attached screenshot)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open place dialog 
2. Look for a separator or creates one
3. Look at this separator

Actual Results:  
icon overlaid over the separator

Expected Results:  
normal separator (i.e. straight line without any icon)

patch for #329367 looks like a good culprit...

patch for winstripe

Sorry for latency, r=mano.
mozilla/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/places/places.css 1.10
asaf and onemen.one@gmail.com:  I think this regressed the fix for bug #364316.

the fix for that bug included some rules to keep favicons at 16x16 in the bm manager and history sidebar (for example).

you don't need !important here, I think. also, s/0px/0/.

r=mano otherwise.

spun off to bug #380703
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
