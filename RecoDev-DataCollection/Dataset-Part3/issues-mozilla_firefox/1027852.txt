When altering a property on an AudioNode, like a GainNode's "gain", I should be able to enter in `.1` and have that set the gain to `0.1`.

Currently we `JSON.parse` the string entered into the VariablesView, so this fix would be in the `_onEval` method in `browser/devtools/webaudioeditor/webaudioeditor-view.js`

AudioNode Inspector should evaluate floats without a leading 0. r=jsantell
Looks great! Can we add a test for this? Probably best to add a quick float test in this one:

./browser/devtools/webaudioeditor/test/browser_wa_properties-view-edit.js

Note: this test is disabled due to intermittent failures on our test servers, so you will have to uncomment it out in the `browser.ini` in that directory to run it. If you're new to running tests on devtools components, check this out: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking#DevTools_Mochitests

Thanks!!

Looks good, lets just get some tests in there :)
Hi Jordan,

Thanks for the review and the tip. I'll write some tests :)

Looks good! Tests passing (although still commented out in the browser.ini due to the other intermittent failure, but this will turn on when that does).

Small nit, lets get consistent quotes (double) in the tests -- once that's done, I'll merge this in. Thanks Raphaël!

Here is the last nit you asked for.

Try test looking good
Do I have to do something to checkin the patch?

Raphaël -- the sheriffs will check it in (just like Carsten did above) -- they'll mark the bug as resolved in a day or two if nothing terrible breaks :)
Jordan -- thanks for the explanation, I discovered the process :)
