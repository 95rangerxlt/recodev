Web Console always opens with all filters turned on.  When testing pages, it would be useful if it remembered the user settings after being closed and opened again. This would make it far more useful as a debugging tool.  It's frustrating to have to sort through the filters every time and I think most people using this tool will be wanting to check the same sets of filters most of the time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Web Console, all filters on.
2. Set custom filters.
3. Close Web Console.
4. Reopen Web Console, custom filter settings lost, all filters on.

This is a good suggestion. I don't think it likely this will land in Firefox 4, but we can tackle this in a follow up.

This is a regression. We used to store all of the filter settings in the a storage object, i think that bit was forgotten in the ui re-write
It seems plausible that the toolbar change would have changed how (and whether!) filters were saved. cc'ing Patrick for an opinion on that.
While we wouldn't block on this, a small patch with tests would get my automatic approval, so marking this pre-approved.
I think I'd like to get this in for final. taking.

Change of priorities. I won't be working on this in the near future.
Sonny, let me know if you need any help.
I think we just need to store the buttons state in a pref (we already store a couple of prefs in devtools.webconsole.*).

patch v1

So basically I reused the devtools.hud.display.filter.* prefs which were not used. I added them to the firefox.js pref file and deleted the code supposed to set the default prefs.
Also I've deleted devtools.hud.display.filter.global because it was not used at all.
Since it's my first patch I tried to keep this patch as simple as possible but I think we'll need some code improvements such as renaming the prefs to something like devtools.webconsole.filter.* since it's not only UI related anymore.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Patch looks great! Thank you very much for your work!

There's only one issue: the new test breaks other tests. Please run the entire set of tests from the folder to see which tests fail.

The problem is that the test doesn't clear the user preferences. You need to call Services.prefs.clearUserPref() for each pref, at the end of the test. You may also need to do this in other tests that change the filter settings because those leave the Web Console in a state that breaks other tests that expect to find all of their messages.

Looking forward for the updated patch. Thank you very much!

Do you need to close/reopen the tab? Just closing the Web Console and reopening it should be sufficient for your checks.

patch v1.1

I think we should avoid adding more prefs with 'hud' in the name. I suggest changing the prefs to: devtools.webconsole.filter.* (drop the .display as I don't think it's needed).

Update the test as per Mihai's instructions.

Thanks Sonny!
Rob, yep, agree that's what I was saying on comment 11.
If you are agree I'll open a new bug for code cleaning/prefs name.

I updated my patch to follow Mihai's instructions but I got troubles with tests, still need to figure out what's wrong.

I'll upload it tomorrow.

Addressed Mihai's comments.
Added comments in the test.
BTW I have 25 tests failing (devtools/) but it happens with or without my patch. Probably comes from my configuration.

This may well be bug 670857.
Panos, yes it looks like. Thanks.

This is great! Patch is ready to land! Thank you very much for your contributions!

A couple of nits: (1) the pref prefix could be changed here and now - even before we do other cleanups in another patch; (2) the test has some long lines (which go over the 80 chars soft limit).

I will push this patch to the try server, and if results are green, I will land this in fx-team (tomorrow).
Try push results will show up here:

made some slight tweaks per mihai's recommendations.

I had a test failure when running:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/devtools/webconsole/test/browser/browser_webconsole_bug_597460_filter_scroll.js | Test timed out

I don't have time to look at this right now, but but if someone could, I can land tomorrow.

No problem. Thank you for the update.

The problem:

  HUDService.setFilterState(hudId, "network", true);

hudId is undefined, the setFilterState() call throws. This needs to be:

  HUDService.setFilterState(hud.hudId, "network", true);

Will update the patch.
