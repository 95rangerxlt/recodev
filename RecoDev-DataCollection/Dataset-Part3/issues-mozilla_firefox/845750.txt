jsbBraceStyleManual2=Select the coding style of braces: collapse - put braces on the same line as control statements; expand - put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style); end-expand - put end braces on own line; expand-strict - put braces on own line even if it will break your code.

1) My understanding is that collapse, end-expand, etc. should not be translated, since they're parameter values. Am I right? In this case a localization comment should be added to explain it.

2) "even if it will break your code". Breaking the code means that the code is no more functional or something else?

Correct, I have added a comment to clarify this.

It may no longer be functional. I have added a comment to clarify this.
