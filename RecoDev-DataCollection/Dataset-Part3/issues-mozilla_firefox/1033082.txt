Right now each @media rule link is to the line number of the first rule within the media ruleset. It should be the line of the @media rule itself.

Show exact line numbers for media queries

The platform bug was fixed, so we can use getRuleLineFor with @media rules now, this patch uses that.

The code changes look fine.

I'm still seeing some weirdness on the line numbers on inline sheets but the weird thing is that it starts working once I add a new line in the style editor.  Even with this, it is an improvement over the current situation, so I'm fine with dealing with this in a follow up if you'd like:

* Open http://bgrins.github.io/devtools-demos/styleeditor/media.html
* Open style editor to second sheet.  Notice that the line #s are off a bit (4, 10, 25)
* Add a new line somewhere in the sheet.  Notice that the line #s snap to correct places.
* Open style editor to third sheet (which has the same contents, but not inline).  Notice the line #s (2, 8, 23)

May or may not be related, but I get a promise rejection after switching back and forth from the middle stylesheet: "Error: Unknown sheet source" (looks like that may be originating in sheetToUrl for csscoverage.js).

Yeah, getRuleLineFor reports line number from the top of the document ): There's a hacky function to account for this that we should use here.

Yeah, doesn't sound related to this change.
