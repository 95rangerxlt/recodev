When inspecting a SPDY request, the Network tab details for the request shows this header field under "Request Headers":

    Accept-Encoding:"gzip, deflate"

This field isn't actually sent for SPDY requests, and the server doesn't receive it. I think the field is suppressed in Necko SPDY code, as the protocol explicitly requires gzip compression.

This is moot, because firefox 44 now sends the accept-encoding request header in spdy because it includes brotli (which is not implicit as gzip is)

devtools generally shows semantics not raw bytes, so I'm not sure it was doing the wrong thing before (the request is gzip eligible because spdy says all requests are gzip eligible). but its moot.
