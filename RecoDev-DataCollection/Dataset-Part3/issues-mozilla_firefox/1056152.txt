I'm seeing this in my console, and it's because of this line:

I don't really want to fire off all of the build machinery just for this, so, hoping a sheriff doesn't mind coalescing this. I have no try run, but, well, this is a trivial patch and I know what I'm doing. Hopefully that's enough. :)
Sorry you had to clean up after me Mike, I've introduced this the day before and it also seems that we don't have tests for it.
Don't worry about it. :)
