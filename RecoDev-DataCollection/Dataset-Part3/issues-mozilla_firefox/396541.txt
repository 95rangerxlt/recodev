the Show Password dialog. seriously.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9a8pre) Gecko/2007091802 Minefield/3.0a8pre ID:2007091802

1. New profile, start firefox
2. Tools > Options > Security > Passwords > Show Passwords..

Expected:
- A dialog showing my passwords (or lack of in the case of a new profile)

Actual:
- A silly looking dialog. It appears to be purely firefox chrome, in that there are no Windows decorations such as a titlebar, the maximize/minimize/close window icons, and no way of resizing the dialog.

Works as expected:

Bug 394666 seems most likely.
Here is link to image showing the lack of window frame for the Show passwords dialog: http://img218.imageshack.us/my.php?image=passworddialogyf5.jpg

Also, when Show passwords window is maximized using Task Manager, it maximizes to edge of monitor screen despite the task bar.

Looks like the patch for bug 394666 didn't take into account "standalone" prefpanes.
