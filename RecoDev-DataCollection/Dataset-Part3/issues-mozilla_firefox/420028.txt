Test failures on Windows today:

FAIL - Check extension for existance - chrome://mochikit/content/browser/browser/fuel/test/browser_Extensions.js
FAIL - Exception thrown - TypeError: inspector is null - chrome://mochikit/content/browser/browser/fuel/test/browser_Extensions.js

I assume the other platforms haven't hit this because they haven't clobbered yet.

I'm disabling this test (browser/fuel/test/browser_Extensions.js), because there doesn't seem to be an obvious was to fix it offhand.

At least for the basic testing you can use the default theme which should always be present. Though you can't enable/disable it.

Get basic Extensions tests re-enabled

This patch re-enables Extensions tests and does the most basic testing that can be done without an extension present. This will at least catch bugs like bug 426175.

I'll work on a way to get a dummy extension placed into the mochitest profile from the test folder for full testing.

needed so we don't regress things like bug 426175, which these minimal tests do catch.
Now that bug 426175 is fixed, we can land these tests to make sure it doesn't regress

But I am leaving this bug open until we find a way to "inject" a dummy extension into the mochitest profile
Resolving FIXED, followup bug needed.
I filed bug 433075.
Oops, didn't realize you had filed bug 433032.
