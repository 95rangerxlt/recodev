Currently, to access the Simulator configuration screen in WebIDE, you need to set the following pref to true:

    devtools.webide.enableRuntimeConfiguration

To enable it by default, at least some of the following things need to be addressed first:

- Persist Simulator configurations (bug 1146519)
- Add more hardware emulation features from the device profiles
- Handle addon removal better (instead of simply deleting a configuration) (bug 1146521)
- Add visual feedback for incomplete/problematic configurations (bug 1146531)

I'll submit this to try once a few dependency bugs are fixed.

Enable Simulator configuration screen by default in WebIDE.

This is a pretty simple patch.

I'm not sure I'll have time to address all the dependencies of this bug before leaving, but maybe it makes sense to enable this feature once configurations are persistent (Bug 1146519), and leave the other dependencies as follow-ups?

Review of attachment 8627763:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It seems fine to me to enable after persisting lands (bug 1146519).

Is there a bug filed to allow adding additional simulator profiles?  As it is, it seems you only get N options if you have N simulator add-ons installed, though you could redirect one of those to a different add-on from the one it started as.

That's a weird UX gimmick, I agree. Filed bug 1179142 for that.

Carried over.
Sheriffs, please land this patch along with bug 1146519 (try push for both patches is in that other bug).

I've added a section on this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Setting_up_runtimes#Configuring_Simulators. Is there anything else I ought to mention?

Looks good!

I believe the "custom builds" page[1] can also be updated to suggest this approach, instead of setting preferences on the add-on like it currently describes.

Thanks Ryan. I've added a note in that page, but also left the original stuff intact for the time being.
Added to the release notes:
Configurable Firefox OS Simulator in WebIDE, to simulate reference devices like phones, tablets, even TVs
with a link to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Setting_up_runtimes#Configuring_Simulators

Thanks to Jan Keromnes for bringing this to my attention
