The developer has been notified through AMO.
Eric, if you have any questions about adding e10s support to FoxyProxy, just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or ask Ally on this bug. MDN also has a good introduction:

Thank you so much for fixing this.  Everything I use supports e10s now!
