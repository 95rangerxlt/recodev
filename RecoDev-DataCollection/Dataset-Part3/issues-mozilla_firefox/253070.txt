The "Web Features" window has been completely reworked. "Block Popup Windows"
now has an "Exceptions" button which opens a dialog where you can enter sites
and whitelist them using the "Allow" button.

There's also a new option to "Allow web sites to install software" (moved from
Options->Advanced).

Note that I suggested to rename some of the buttons to "Allowed Sites...", see
bug 250543.

djst: Your prefs documentation is out of date. Do you have a recent version, or
would you like me to write the fix?
OK, I'm taking this bug. It also appears that the "Load Images" has an
exceptions dialog that lets you block or allow images from sites. I'll change
the relative documentation for that as well.

Updates I made to prefs.xhtml

These are the updates I made. I think the only problem is the screenshots need
to be updated, however R.J. says they're the same on an aviary build he got
just today... yet on linux, on an aviary build from today, I get a web options
dialog similar to the one steffen mentioned above.
nosebleed: Can you make these in a diff (cvs diff -u -w > patchFile)?

OK, I'm kinda new to making patches... I hope this one was done correctly... :)

According to the Help Coding Style Guide
(http://www.mozilla.org/projects/help-viewer/documentation_coding-style.php),
you are only permitted to have 80 characters a line. You are over this limit.
Not a big deal, just something to remember.

I know that the help docs aren't in 100% compliance with this guide, but I'd
like them to be. I'll fix this when I checkin the patch.

Same nit here.

Thanks a lot for this patch Sean!
Fix checked in.
Ah, I totally forgot about that limit... I'll be sure to remember it next time
or set up my editor to be restricted to 80 characters. Thanks for accepting the
patch :)

screenshot of the Web Features options panel

This is what the dialog looks like, with the patch in bug 250543 (which is
neither reviewed nor checked in yet) applied.

The Help Doc on "Allow web sites to install software" doesn't mention the
"Exceptions"/"Allowed Sites" button yet. Clicking the button opens a dialog
just like the popup blocker, where you can whitelist sites.

The part on "Load Images" needs to be moved above "Enable Java".
Reopening.
I just checked in a fix to move the part on Load Images upwards.

We still need a desciption for the Exceptions button on "Allow web sites to
install software".
I'll go ahead and add a description... what I don't understand is how I got that
dialog for Web Features if it hadn't even been checked in yet.
The dialog is in, bug 250543 only renames some buttons from "Exceptions" to
"Allowed Sites...". You can ignore that for now, I'll make the necessary
adjustment as soon as bug 250543 is checked in.

This patchfile should add the information for the exceptions dialog for "Allow

What do you mean by "anyway"?
You should point out that software installs are not possible at all from sites
which are not whitelisted (which is why I want to rename the button to "Allowed
Sites" by the way), and that even for those which are whitelisted, the user will
be prompted to confirm each installation.

Write Firefox with a capital F, please.

Patch, adds exceptions help info to software install section (updated)

OK, these changes have been made. Anything else that needs to be changed or
added?
Almost done! My final nits are:
- There's still one "firefox" in there :)
- I'd prefer to have the part in the () brackets as a separate sentence. Also
add an "and" before "you".

Looks good to me. r=rlk@trfenv.com. I don't have access to a machine with CVS
at the moment, but once I do, I'll check this in.
Fix checked in.

A nitpick to fix if so desired: use &brandShortName; instead of Firefox.

Jeff, I think you're looking at an older patch, because it uses &brandShortName;
in the newer version.
