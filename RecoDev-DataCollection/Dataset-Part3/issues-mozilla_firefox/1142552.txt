Expression closures (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) are a nonstandard language extension we'd like to remove from SpiderMonkey.

For browser-ctrlTab.js, bug 1121471 already took care of the ctrlTab object's selected, isOpen, tabCount and tabPreviewCount getters. However, the allTab object's toolbarButton and canOpen getters still use expression closures:

The general pattern for getters is that:

get x() y,

needs to be replaced with:

get x() {
  return y;
},
