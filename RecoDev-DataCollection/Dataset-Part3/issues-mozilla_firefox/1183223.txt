First step towards taking all the markers logic outside docshells.

Once everything is moved out, we may consider moving that directory somewhere else, but in the meantime, it's a good way to start things going.

Best look at the raw patch file instead of splinter review.

Well, you'll need proper moz.build then in timeline/ at some point, so why not do it now?
Just creating the directory, but not integrating it with the build system feels odd.
...since it doesn't really help with anything.
Sounds good, will update the patch.

Don't you want 
/docshell/base/timeline in local includes in the original moz.build, and then no need for the
change in nsDocShell.h

Meh. I guess it would be more elegant indeed. I'll file a followup for this so I don't have to rebase everything.
