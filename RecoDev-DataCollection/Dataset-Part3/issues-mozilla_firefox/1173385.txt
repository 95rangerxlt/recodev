There is a $$ command line helper that's a wrapper for document.querySelectorAll.  It seems to swallow errors though, we should just let any errors propagate to the console.

> $$("")
 undefined
> document.querySelectorAll("")
 SyntaxError: An invalid or illegal string was specified

That trick should work.

Forwarding this to fitzgen, he's better qualified to review this change.  The changes to test_jsterm_queryselector.html look fine

Let's do `DevToolsUtils.safeErrorString(error.unsafeDereference())` instead of `error.unsafeDereference().toString()`.

DevToolsUtils.safeErrorString: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/DevToolsUtils.js#16

Nitpick: also, please format multiline `a : b ? c` expressions like this:

  obj.prop = foo
    ? bar
    : baz;

Which is consistent with the way we do it elsewhere.

I updated the patch (though not the tests yet). I attached how the exception is rendered with the patch. 

The use of |DevToolsUtils.safeErrorString| appends the callstack to the error string (so the internal one). Nick, are you sure we want to use this function?

Ah, ok. My bad. Carry on with the last iteration.
No problem, thanks for the answer!
