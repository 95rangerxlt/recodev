I'm dropping tracking as in-content prefs will not ship with 37. I have marked this bug as a dependency of the in-content prefs metabug and think it should be triaged with the normal desktop process.
Jared, can you provide more details here? Comment 0 explicitly said bug 1022582 didn't fix this...

Huh, I didn't see that line in comment #0 when I first saw this bug. But I tested it out on today's Nightly (2015-02-04) and couldn't reproduce it before I closed the bug.

There has been some work with checkboxes and SVG so I assumed that bug 1022582 was the one but it could have been another bug that fixed it.
