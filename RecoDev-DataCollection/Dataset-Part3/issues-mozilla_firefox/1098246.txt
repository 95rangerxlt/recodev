I think we can have in same bug step 8:
> Click on "Presentation Mode" button to enter in full screen mode, allow to enter in full screen, scroll through pages and use context menu.
But this needs to be investigated.
Created attachment 8533715
patch v1.0

For this enhancement I had to first set the scale size to "page-fit" otherwise scrolling using keys won't change a full page. 

When I try to click the presentation mode button I get the following warning in console:
>Request for full-screen was denied because Element.mozRequestFullScreen() was not called from inside a short running user-generated event handler
On the first search I found-out that we can't enter in fullscreen mode trough an automated script:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9454125/javascript-request-fullscreen-is-unreliable#answer-9747340

Now even if we can enter in the full-screen, we should test the navigation in fullscreen mode in a diffrent test becassue in fullscreen we can navigate only by using keys and whithout the naviagation elements(buttons/outline/page number). So it makes sense for me to take care of requirements from comment 0.
Thanks Dave.
