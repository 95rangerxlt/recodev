Updated XP (KB890830, KB896424) November 11th and now Mozilla speller in email searches and always ends up with the word "Your" and no other word. I have the problem on two computers. The speller in internet explorer works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just search using the email speller.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Misspell a word and conduct a search, after the recent XP update and the only word that will come up after the search is "Your."

Expected Results:  
Should get a list of words to fit the misspelled word, but instead get "Your."

I'm sill with you guys. It shold have given me a list of words that might fit the misspelled word. I did reload Mozilla, but the speller was not working properly.

Firefox 1.0.7 doesn't come with a spell-checker.  What spell-checker are you using -- is it something you installed as an extension in Firefox 1.0.7, or part of a webmail service you use?
Guess this shows I know little of the webmail. I open
Mozilla then Yahoo. I cannot use the speller using
Mozilla and Yahoo, but I can using internet explorer
and Yahoo. And the problem just started when I updated
with the new XP patch, So is it me or what? I have two
computers and I have the same problem on both
computers. 
FYI, Contacted SBC Yahoo and I was told they knew nothing of Mozilla Firefox so they could not assist me, they were in India. I was given a survey and told them what I was told and what I felt. Two days later SBC yahoo called me and I was not able to call them back, but today the problem was fixed. Seems they knew somenthing about Mozilla I just had to voice myself. The problem was only SBC Yahoo standard Yahoo worked fine, I passed that on to SBC Yahoo perhaps that is how they fixed the problem. Sorry for bothering you about the problem.
