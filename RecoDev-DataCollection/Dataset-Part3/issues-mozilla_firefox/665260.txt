I think it could be interesting to have this data for telemetry, even if it doesn't have any practical uses. To be clear, I mean total age, not uptime of current process.

The way we write sessionstore.js, it clobbers the file creation time stamp each write so we can't just extract it.

Dietrich, Taras - does this sound useful?

Yes.

Does the thing. Due to bug 665702, this data isn't exposed outside of the file.

I tested by checking the timestamp in sessionstore.js like so:

first startup with apptabs (no previous value):
  1308595047885
restart (session not resumed / just app tabs):
  1308595192604
restore previous session:
  1308595047885
  (the start time from previous session overwrites new value)
restart with resume_session_once=true:
  1308595047885
restart with startup.page=3 (aka restore):
  1308595047885
