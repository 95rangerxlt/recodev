Can you show us the proper "disabled" images?

Then I wonder what the third line is for? :-)

They are probably for the 'pressed' state in Bookmarks Manager toolbar. In the new 2.0 theme, buttons are not native. Instead the 'normal' state image is replaced by a 'pressed' state image when it is clicked. See Bug 351616 which is related.


So, counting from the top

First line is for unpressed state
Second line is for pressed state
Third Line is for hovered state
Forth Line is for disabled state

?

No...  That ain't right.

So, counting from the top

First line is supposed for unpressed state
Second line is supposed for hovered state
Third Line is supposed for pressed state
Forth Line is supposed for disabled state

Fix v.1

The more you look...

This (branch-only) patch:
 - makes winstripe use the disabled images instead of the active images for disabled states
 - makes pinstripe use the active images instead of the hover images for active states
 - removes the CSS for the "new livemark" button that existed on Aviary for about a week
 - mucks around with a little whitespace that annoyed me

I really don't like this approach, please prefix the :hover and :hover:active selectors with :not([disabled="true"]) instead. I think I managed to convince gavin this is the right thing ;)

r=mano otherwise.
So there are no problem with the icons used for the other states (pressed, unpressed, hover)?

Comment addressed, carrying over r=mano and looking for approval now that it's a slightly more appropriate time for it.
