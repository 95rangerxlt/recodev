When I have my HTML Editor open and copy any text from a webpage in Firefox 3.5.5 to the clipboard (using either the Keyboard shortcut or the menu) then my HTML Editor crashes (and the Windows problemreporting window appears...) The problem does not appear with Firefox 3.0.15. 
I reproduced the problem on two different computers.
The HTML Editor I am using is: Phase 5 (IE4) Release:01.11.2001. Sure it is old, but it worked with everything until Firefox 3.5.5. (Newer versions of this editor have been released under a more restricted licence.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3.5.5. and the HTML-Editor (order does not matter)
2. Open any webpage, copy any text.

Actual Results:  
3. Now the Windows problemreporting window appears, telling that htmledit.exe crashed.

Expected Results:  
- no crash is desired. For example FF 3.0.15 does not produce the crash.

Sounds like a bug in the editor, not a bug in Firefox.

> Sounds like a bug in the editor, not a bug in Firefox.

Well, yes it sounds like a bug in the editor. But I am using this editor since years and have usualy many applications running and do "copy paste". No other application has ever managed to crash it as mentioned above, only FF 3.5.5. 

So at least I believe that FF 3.5.5. does something different when copying to the clipboard, than other programs (and any previous FF version).

The version of the Editor I am using, can be found in the archive:
http://web.archive.org/web/20020118110823/http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/~hg8444/htmledit20011101.zip

It has no installer, just unpack and run to reproduce the error.
Thank you. In 3.5.6 the problem does not appear any more!

Great!
