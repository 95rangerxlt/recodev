patch for changing the output from -createprofile

This will enable some automation. There are reasons to want to create a new profile auotmatically. As it is, one can run the app with the '-createprofile' option and one gets a new profile and then the info about what was created is gone. One could guess the directory based on the platform, or find all the profiles and see what is new in the list, or one could call the directory service in another script, or ....

Or the '-createprofile' option could just write out the path. That might be easiest.

By the way, it is a couple of lines worth of change.

This is fine. I would recommend, however, that for most tests you use an explicit -profile <path> argument, instead of -P <name>. That avoids polluting the "global" profile list on the machine.

I am figuring that I would have to create the profile, get the location, and then move the profile myself. This would work.

It sounded as though you were suggesting I could give the '-createprofile' a path so that it would not create the profile in the usual places. I have found that one cannot use '-createprofile' in this way.

I think Benjamin meant "mkdir ~/tmp-whatever && firefox -profile ~/tmp-whatever".

Is a super-review needed?
