Issue: 

When opening the Hello FTE via the "Get Started" button, the panel is already open when the page FTE loads. This means the panel does not exhibit the usual "sticky" behavior that we have when calling showMenu('loop') directly (the page is already calling this this on load, but I'm assuming it just returns because the menu is already open, which makes sense).

This means that when the FTE starts, clicking anywhere on the web page will close the menu and door-hanger. I think there's a chance some people might do this accidently, and not read the door-hanger text in time.

Perhaps it makes sense to close the panel when someone clicks "Get Started"? This already seems to be the behavior when clicking the "Tour" link in the gears menu.

It's also worth noting that we have the same issue when the user has a conversation waiting, and they click the hello icon which re-opens the tab. I'm not sure what we can do in this case? I could hide and then reshow the menu on page load, but this might appear a bit weird.

I resolved this part in bug 1080953. I'll solve the initial tour opening here.
