User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:16.0) Gecko/16.0 Firefox/16.0a1
Build ID: 20120621053048

Steps to reproduce:

I built firefox from mozilla-central with --enable-gstreamer --disable-libnotify


Actual results:

on startup "third party" (false) pdf plugin is apparently not compatible.


Expected results:

implementation of pdf viewer should be transparent

also, sorry if dup, i did search, also, is there an easy pref to turn off the integrated pdf reader, I feel distros might want to do that, as i have noticed that evince is significantly faster than the new integrated reader. (of course it is much less sucky than adobe however)

pdf.js is no longer an extension, this shouldn't be an issue anymore.
