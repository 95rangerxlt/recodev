The problem occurred when I was reading a tutorial on that web page.
After a little while I clicked on the page and the page went blank.
Firefox 2 loses its ability to navigate on the web.
Removing tools bars or similar things works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go onto http://godbit.com/article/beginners-guide-to-rails-part-2
2.Click on page background


Actual Results:  
Blank page and navigation between pages does not work.

Expected Results:  
For it to not do anything except keep displaying page.
Its only a button click on the page itself not on any button or any of the sort.
But in ways of the bug the expected result was the result I got.

Keep displaying the page and doing nothing.

Clicking on the page has not the described consequences here.
Did you also try it with disabled extensions or with a new profile?
No I haven't tried that, but its a fresh install so I don't see how that could affect it.
But will try again when I'm at work.
