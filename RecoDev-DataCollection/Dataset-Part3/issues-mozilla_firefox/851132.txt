Rather than opening a new tab, I think the most correct thing to do on middle click is nothing. Both the stylesheet text and the stylesheet's URL are right there in the Style Editor. I have a simple patch that does that, plus it also fixes the "save" button, which has the same middle-click-opens-new-tab bug.

Very simple, I like it.
This patch breaks browser_styleeditor_sv_keynav.js, can't land it yet.
