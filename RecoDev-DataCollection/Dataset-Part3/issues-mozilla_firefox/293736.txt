The build script moves/renames the file "en.lproj" to [ab].lproj.
When it tries this on the en-GB build, ab == en and so the script
is trying to rename en.lproj to en.lproj.  (Thanks to MMx for describing this on
#l10n).

Reproducible: Always

The makefile to blame is in /browser/locales, checking if Thunderbird l10n is
affected, too
Does Thunderbird l10n also use /browser/locales/Makefile.in?
I can't find an equivalent to
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/locales/Makefile.in#192 in /mail

Furthermore, the renaming scheme is not good. It always renames to ab.lproj,
even for locales that _need_ the region identifier, or did I misunderstand the code?
I would suggest using the code that is used for the app, in ab_CD form. (no
further extensions though, like dialects or things like "ja_JP_mac") Otherwise,
Languages like Chinese will break. 
The problem with using en_US.lproj / en_GB.lproj is that the mac does not
recognize them and fallback gracefully: "U.S. English" is not in the default
international list for English Mac OS X, while "English" is. I'm certainly
willing to try other naming schemes, but I tend to think that the en-GB build
ought to be using en.lproj, not en_GB.lproj.
yes, convinced. I dug a little deeper into the Apple docs and found this:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFLocales/Articles/CFLocaleConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002240-164446-BCIGEEJE

If I understand "locale hirarchies" right, it is save for us to only provide a
two/three letter code for the language ("For language designations, Mac OS X
supports both ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 conventions.") and no region at all. Mac
OS X should select the region according to user preferences then.

proposed patch for /browser/locales/Makefile.in

proposed patch to test whether we have $(AB) == en here - not trying to rename
en.lproj in that case.
I will run a build with that patch later to see if it works as expected.

new patch, fixing bustage

I tested the patch and found out that the "ifneq ... endif" block that I
introduced should not be indented. Fixed that and now it works as expected.

new patch, fixing bustage

a short explanation: 
This patch is needed to turn the en-GB Mac-tinderbox green (or anything but
red) - so it would be great if it could go in soon.
