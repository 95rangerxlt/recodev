sidebarsCSS.patch

CSS has been cleaned up, but can probably still use a little work. I'd like to grab the icons used in the former panels but I'm having a hard time inspecting those panels to see how they were incorporated.

Also maybe I can add some conditional text for the wifi/simulator sections if their arrays are empty? i.e. 'No wifi devices found'.

Small non-code things to do:

The commit message on the patch should be `Bug <number> - Clean up WebIDE sidebars CSS. r=jfong` (or whoever is reviewing).

A couple of things to check/change:

- Make sure that the look and feel for the non sidebar version is still the same as before - we want your changes only to be valid for when this pref is enabled. Go to about:config and toggle devtools.webide.sidebars to check.

- The buttons that you've changed should probably have a bit of definition - maybe a slight border on bottom/right for each one? What do you think?

Although the same either way maybe use border: 0, but not really opposed to just leaving it.

If we have a width of 100% but padding of 3% that would go over 100, no?

New patch adds icons to sidebar buttons, fixes borders, and styles the recently added configure-buttons for simulators.

The sidebar styling does not conflict with or override any of the pre-existing styles on the panels.

It looks great to me, thanks for working on this!  Just a few style nits to clean up.

There is a DevTools CSS style guide[1], but it's a bit outdated as far the "splitting files" stuff, we no longer really do that, and we have never done it for WebIDE.

It is helpful for syntax rules we try to follow, though.

Nit: this appears to be extra blank line at the end of the file, kinda hard to tell for sure in this view.  Only want one blank line at the end.

Nits fixed.

Still one nit left.

Once you've updated, I'll push this patch to Try.  Should be safe, but doesn't hurt to check.
