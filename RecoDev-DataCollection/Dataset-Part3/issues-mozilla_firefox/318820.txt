What is the purpose of the status bar when viewing places? 

I agree that an active menuitem for the status bar while it is hidden is a bug though. 
The status bar disappears in the other tab, not in the places view.
(On an unrelated note, the menu item not being disabled is bug 318823.)

patch

The cached value of the previous status bar state can get confused with tab switching. The more reliable way to remember to show or hide the status bar based on the user's actual preference is to read the checked value of the menu, since this will always reflect what they wanted, not what the status bar happens to be at any particular point in time.
I think this is fixed. 
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
