Build ID: 20130910160258

Steps to reproduce:

1. created PDF file using InDesign PDF export with fonts included
2. opened pdf file in Firefox 24.0 (Windows 7 64bit german) internal pdf viewer

(example file included)


Actual results:

3. text is not displayed with the correct font (page 7 and others)




Expected results:

Note: the pdf files can be opened and viewed correctly in any other viewer (Adobe Reader, PDF X-Change Viewer, Adobe Acrobat)
We checked other combinations but the cause is foggy - the bullet at the beginning of the lines is a reason but not alone...

Can you attach a screenshot of the issue on your side. It seems to be fine on my side: http://i.imgur.com/xXHNHK5.jpg
Hi and thanks for the quick answer.
Forgot to add that this glitch happens on all our pc's here at work...
Please check my website for additional screenshots:

thx
I don't see that on page 8. The only issue is about "Smask" on my side (on the right with the tilted URL), but it's a feature unimplemented in PDF Viewer.

I think your issue is about font selection on your computer.

Can you open the console and copy the errors when the PDF is loaded.
Here you are:
[15:32:52.340] "PDF 8cc2e46bdbaffe43b31a2f6767c427e9 [1.5 Adobe PDF Library 9.9 / Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0.4)] (PDF.js: 0.8.291)"
[15:32:52.681] "Warning: TODO: graphic state operator SMask"

And you're right: I just double-checked with a private Win7 notebook and the error doesn't show up. 
But since other pdf viewers show the pages correctly there must be some misinterpretation on the internal viewer's side... on our company pc's the error can be reproduced...
One thing you can test is to create a new profile (see https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) and to test again on the machine where the issue is visible.
I created a new profile and opened the pdf file with that ff session: the error occurs just the same. Could it be a codepage thingy?
Unable to replicate with FF27 and DirectWrite 6.2.  Can you 1) paste about:graphics here 2) try with FF27?

Brendan, should I confirm this issue or mark it as duplicate of bug 901288? Thank you
Most like a duplicate, but hard to be sure. Let's leave this one open.
