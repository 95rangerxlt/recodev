testUncompilable() shouldn't console.log()
Correct definition of function is:

function testUncompilable() {
  // It's not totally clear how a module loader should perform with unusable
  // modules, however at least it should go into a flat spin ...
  // GCLI mini_require reports an error as it should
  try {
    let unrequireable = require('gclitest/unrequirable');
    fail();
  }
  catch (ex) {
    // expected
  }
}
