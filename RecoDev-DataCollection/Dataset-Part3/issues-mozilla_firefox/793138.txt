Inspect command is broken
?
In gcli typing inspect <selector> does nothing ... it should open the highlighter
Seems to work fine after pulling but both Joe and I thought that there was a problem.

Maybe it was an issue with case insensitivity? querySelectorAll in HTML documents is case insensitive whilst in XHTML documents it is case sensitive. I am assuming that we were both in XHTML documents and erroneously assumed case insensitivity.
Could we keep it open for a while, I have a feeling that there is something going on here, it's not just a random thing.
Maybe this is a consequence of not showing the highlighter when the mouse is not over the content window?
Is this still true?
It seems to work for me. Lets re-open if we find further problems
