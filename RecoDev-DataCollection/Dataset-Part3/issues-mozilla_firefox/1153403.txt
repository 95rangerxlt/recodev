Bug 1043612 has been landed.
However, the following in-content subdialogs do not remember its size.

* content > Fonts & Colors > Advanced...
* content > Languages > Choose...

Persistence of the size of the Fonts subdialog is useful for ja locale.

Those dialogs don't have the persist attribute specified on the <window>, therefore they don't get persisted. We could look in to changing that though.

Looking at this more, these dialogs don't resize well and weren't designed to be resizable.

I think this UI polish bug is safe and simple enough to take late in Beta. Beta+ Aurora+

ni Florin to add in-content pref UI resizing to his team's list for exploratory testing if time permits.

Verified on Windows 7 64bit, Ubuntu 13.10 32bit and Mac OSX 10.9.5 using Firefox 38 Beta 8 (buildID: 20150426174329) and the following in-content subdialogs aren't resizable: 
- Content tab -> "Advanced" (Fonts)
- Content tab -> "Colors"
- Privacy tab -> History -> Use custom settings for history -> "Settings for Clearing History"
- Security tab -> Passwords -> "Change Master Password" 

Additional exploratory testing related to in-content pref UI resizing is done under general testing for "In-Content Preferences" feature.
