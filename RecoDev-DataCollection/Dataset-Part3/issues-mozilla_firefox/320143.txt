In the Tool|Options|Privacy tab the days to history expiration and the cache size can be set once and only once.  Thereafter the focus is reversed on the two tabs and new values cannot be stored.  Entries in the history tab are recorded in the cache tab and vice-versa.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Tools|Options|Privacy.  Change days to remember history and cache size.  Close the dialog.
2.Open about:config and verify that the changes were made.
3.Open the dialog again.  Type in the History tab and then in the Cache tab.  Go back to the History tab.  Close the dialog
4.Open about:config again and check the values.
Actual Results:  
1. In step 3, typing in the history tab (including backspace characters) appears in the cache tab and vice-versa.
2. The new values entered in step 3 are not saved.

Expected Results:  
1. Keyboard entries made in step 3 should appear in the correct tabs.
2. Changes in step 3 should be saved.

I should have added that the behavior is correct in Windows version 1.5.

It works but only after a browser restart.
The problem is that I can't delete or type anymore in the inputfield of the options window after clicking OK. I have to restart first.
What I delete or type in the History tab disappears or appears in the Cache tab and vice versa. :)
But after a restart it works, until I click OK again.
Regression between 1.9a1_2005120808 and 1.9a1_2005120917.

I can't even guess as to which of the bugs in that range would have caused this. Are you sure that range is correct?
I don't see the problem in the 8 Dec nightly.

But I do see it in the next one. :)
This seems to be fixed (by Bug 319732?).

Ah, I missed bug 303713. This is almost certainly a regression from that checkin, and fixed by 319732, as you said.
