It is often very difficult to follow the flow of events in devtools code, especially because of our prolific use of promises.

We should add devtools.dump.emit=false (true only for tests) as this allows us to log extra details to test logs.

We should wait for Joe's feedback to see if it is okay to have this on for default when testing.

Worried about the big try/catch:

We should avoid a big try/catch if we can. What was the reason for it?

We don't, removed and just generally tidied.

Added more info to log

Now the logging looks like this:

EMITTING: BC_update/<() -> emit(breadcrumbs-updated, [Front for domnode/conn0.domnode29] (DIV#output)) from resource:///modules/devtools/inspector/breadcrumbs.js:695
Bug 976679 moves event-emitter to toolkit, so you'll need to rebase if that lands before.
Mike, you told me to hold off on reviewing this. Is it ready now?

Switched to using components.stack

Yup, this is ready for review.

We need the try / catch in order to avoid logging info about dead objects (exception). As this is an option enabled by flipping the devtools.dump.emit pref I think we should be fine.

It'd be a good to keep it as small as possible. Can we only wrap the statement that would throw the exception?

Any part of the for loop that goes through any passed arguments can throw so that is about the smallest we can make it.
