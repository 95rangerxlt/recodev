Personas are not correctly aligned at where the caption buttons are. The personas is too far on the right, though just 1px or so. The left-side border of the minimize button is hidden, while on the right of the close button the black border is just a bit to thick.

It is a regression:

Note: This only happens when Firefox is maximized.
Confirming, This is a code issue in Fx, using maximized windows with personas.
Regression, but doesn't block.
I'd like to renom this for blocking. Precisely carving out the caption buttons from the background image was not an easy feat because it involves getting metrics from the system and positioning a XUL element on the right position through CSS..
This, however, makes it rather fragile (this one caused by bug 606160), but if there's no unexpected trouble a patch for this should be straightforward (just changing some magic padding numbers).

Patch

Trivial fix, and with bug 606160 this value actually makes sense, as there's 3px of distance between the close button and the edge of the screen.
Also tested in RTL.

This still doesn't look like a blocker. Yay for getting it fixed anyway though.
