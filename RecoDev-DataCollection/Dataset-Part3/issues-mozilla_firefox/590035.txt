Should be easy, taking
Mostly blocking because of bug 575248, and because I think we should be careful to restore all old tabstrip functionality.

We need to generate the gecko middle click events for NC middle-clicks too. I don't think there's any reason to not always do that, so here's a patch.
Hmm, why does this fix this? I wouldn't think windows would be sending nc mouse events for the new client/content area. (it's not an nc area anymore.)

I'm mostly just curious, did you test this? My middle click on a tab closes it. Middle click on the tab bar area does nothing.
That's because the empty area on the tabbar is considered NC area (to allow aero dragging/dbl clicking)

I missed the last phrase, why do you mean it's not NC area anymore? That's what NS_MOZ_HITTEST is meant to return (I think) on the empty glass areas (e.g. the parts of the tabbar where there are no tabs)

Ah, so we return the nc constant in WM_NCHITTEST and windows generates the appropriate mouse events. That explains why bug 574859 works on non-nc events. 

What about the middle nc double click message? Do we need that as well?

True, M double click is not used but should be supported
