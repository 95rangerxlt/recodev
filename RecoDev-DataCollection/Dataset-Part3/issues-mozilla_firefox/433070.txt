To Bruno Calvignac(bug opener & who proposed a patch):

Will your patch resolve Bug 435143(and Bug 434911 too)?
I can't say for sure but it might. It's anyway definitely related and should be fixed before looking at those other 2 bugs.

Actually need to set a reviewer to get it reviewed.

I think this will fix those too.
Please forgive my ignorance, I don't know how to make use of the information to solve the same problem on my computer.

r=me. This code isn't very good at checking rvs for clone/createInstance, but I suppose those typically only fail in OOM cases. Worth a followup bug on adding some rv checks here perhaps?

I couldn't reproduce bug 435143 and bug 434911 with next build.
