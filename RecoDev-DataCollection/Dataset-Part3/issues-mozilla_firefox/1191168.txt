The Firefox OS Simulator addon hasn't been updated since September 2014. It still specifies 2.0 as the current version which is no longer the latest version and even worse, in Firefox 41.0+ it no longer works because the addon isn't verified.
Each release version (X.Y) of Firefox OS is packaged as a *separate* add-on.  This is so you can test an app across many versions.

In WebIDE, you can install[1] various different add-ons for each version.

The issue about add-on verification is separate.  The simulators do in fact run, even once add-on signatures are required, even though they report as unverified.  The main issue though is you can't currently install a *new* simulator once signatures are required.  See bug 1190973.

Does this address your concerns?

Right. Currently 2.0 shows up as the stable version, all versions 2.1+ as unstable. If my information is correct, the latest version is something newer than 2.0, so the stable/unstable labels may need to be updated.

Looks like bug 1190973 covers this part.

Ah, that's true.  I've updated it so that 2.1 and 2.2 are now shown as stable as well.

I believe that's the only separate issue here, so I'll mark this as fixed.  The remaining works appears tracked by bug 1190973.
