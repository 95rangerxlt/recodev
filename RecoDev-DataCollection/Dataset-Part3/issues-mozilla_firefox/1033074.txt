jgriffin: any chance you know which of these lines is triggering the failure?
It's actually because mozharness isn't parsing the passed/todo/failed lines correctly.  I'll have a patch shortly.
Created attachment 8449059
Use 'mochitest' category for handling the webapprt parser,

Webapprt tests use the same test reporting as mochitest, so we can safely do this.
Comment on attachment 8449059
Use 'mochitest' category for handling the webapprt parser,

Review of attachment 8449059:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

looks like that will accomplish what we want. I just took a look at what we use the suite_category for and it just points to here: http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/mozharness/mozharness/mozilla/testing/errors.py#21

I think rather than hacking the instance for webapprt, we should add webapprt_summary to this dict explicitly. It looks like that's how we added robocop anyway (robocop's summary appears to be based off mochitest_summary too).

jgriffin, what do you think about doing something like: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/5510169

I'm happy to r+ yours or you r+ mine depending on what you think :)
That makes sense, I'll r+ yours and land it.  :)  Thanks.

Merged to production, and deployed.
