Once we ship per-window private browsing support, we need to remove the code exclusively used for global PB mode.  This bug tracks this project.

This basically means removing anything hidden behind #ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING (including removing that flag too.)

I'll be working on this on my globalpbdeath github branch.  You can follow the progress here: <https://github.com/ehsan/mozilla-central/compare/globalpbdeath>.  Once we're ready to land this, I'll attach a folded patch.

sec-review?:I'm concerned that since we are still not multi-process that we need to be concerned that data from PB could leak across when we have one PB window and one standard window. Just want to ensure we have proper eyes looking at this.

FWIW this bug is just about removing code that is not even getting built.
Can't wait to remove a bunch of code from Panorama :)

I'm planning to post a patch maybe in a couple of weeks.  I'm basically waiting to make sure that there aren't any huge blockers that prevent us from shipping this in 20.

Brace yourselves, this is not a small patch!

Most of this is just code removal.  Please take a bit extra care on the places that I have rewritten existing code to do proper indentation, or to simplify it.  I'm currently doing the last set of try run on this patch and I think it should be fully green.

Mike, can you please go over the build system bits here?  I don't have anything specific for you to look at but I mentioned this to gps today and he asked me to get a rubber-stamp from you.

Likewise
Please remove now-unused strings such as privateBrowsingYesTitle from the properties and dtd files.

I'm removing this file.  Do you want me to address this before removing the file?  ;-)

Ditto!
Erf, as I was looking at the files one by one, I hadn't realized they were file removals.

Thanks for the reminder.  I thought I had caught them all, but I found some more and removed them:

This was in a non-gtk2 block before. Will this be a problem?

This appears to be in the wrong list. I'm not sure why it hasn't been breaking Birch, though.

This looks like it should be in the list above, not just the linux one.

We shouldn't get rid of this whole test. Just get rid of this block.

I presume this is being dealt with in the open bugs about the social API?

No, but I'll move it for hygiene reasons.  Thanks for catching it!

Hmm, yeah...  I'll correct this.

This test has effectively been removed for a while...  But you're right, we should just remove the global PB parts.

Yes, that has been fixed in bug 808215.
Unfortunately we can't enable test_prompt.html because of bug 806737.
Sorry, that was supposed to be bug 835904.

We're noting PWPB in the FF20 notes, the removal of global PB is less user facing so no need to note.

Agreed.
