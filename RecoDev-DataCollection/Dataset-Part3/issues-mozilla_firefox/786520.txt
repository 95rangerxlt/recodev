Clean up Makefile.in, v1

I went into browser/aurora/Makefile.in to remove the one-off export:: rule. While I was there, I performed some general cleanup (:= and removed tabs).

I have no clue how to test these changes.

Just my luck I notice that all the branding Makefiles are nearly identical. I'm going to refactor this remove all the DRY violations.

Shouldn't this be BRANDING_FILES_FILES?

If you're going to do this one, can you do browser/branding/*/Makefile.in too?

Consolidate branding Makefile redundancy, v1

Read commit message for info.

Try at http://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=540203a7cd97

I'm not sure if this will have unintended consequences for downstream package builders. It works for Mozilla's needs, however.

Consolidate branding Makefile redundancy, v2

I had a typo in the last past that try caught. This fixes it.

While I was there I renamed some variables to reduce IRC harassment from dolske.

Try run seemed happy. https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=84382401ca8a

Backed out for breaking l10n nightlies.

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/fc32318f8a8b
For the record, the backout breaks incremental builds:
cp: `browser/branding/nightly/default16.png' and `../../../dist/branding/default16.png' are the same file

Install things to $(DIST)/branding from moz.build

I think this makes everything under $(DIST)/branding managed by an install manifest.

I'm pretty sure this is l10n-friendly, because I wrote a comment about it in recursivemake.py. I also have a copy of l10n-central, so I suspect I tried it at some point. The main thing is that the locale makefiles (e.g. https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/0b202671c9e2/browser/locales/Makefile.in#l149) do `make -C <branding dir> export` and expect files to end up in the right places.

Install things to $(DIST)/branding from moz.build

It seems a bit much to introduce a new variable & install manifest for just a handful of files, but it doesn't look like we have a generic way to just install things into dist/ yet (maybe bug 853594 would simplify this). So r+ for now on the grounds that it removes some Makefiles, but I hope we can improve this in the future.

>diff --git a/browser/branding/aurora/moz.build b/browser/branding/aurora/moz.build

Since all these moz.build files are identical, maybe they can just do 'include ../branding-common.mozbuild' or some such, and list the files in there.

$(DIST)/branding (missing ')')

That's a good idea. I left the DIRS assignments and the export of DIST_SUBDIR in the individual moz.build files, because export is already non-obvious enough without it being hidden in an include.

Bah. Fixed.
Try push: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=8148fcc121ec (the orange was from an earlier version of bug 1155816).

That push doesn't have the branding-common.mozbuild change, but I tested locally that it doesn't break anything.

This appears to have caused Linux PGO build bustage: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=9381821&repo=mozilla-inbound
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/6efd5103d766
I pushed this to try by itself, and that came back green, so it's probably safe to reland this one.
