1. Test builds found in
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates/

2. Build sign offs in this bug should be of the form:

the builds in

are okay, or not?
I've updated the windows installer for he-IL to include the RTL theme, and
tested it. the installation file is at:
http://www.viewpoints.co.il/firefox/1.0.3/  i hope to finish the linux installer

Indeed.  We did en-US and l10n respins early this morning.  The files in

Yeah, the latest builds are in the aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates directory, too.
We're confident that this will be the final set of builds that we generate for
1.0.3.  The plan is to release this evening assuming everything is okay.

Chase, a fix has just been checked in for a ga-IE issue (bug 289013). Any chance
of a new round of ga-IE builds for testing?
We've had some new feedback about the code and our drivers will meet today to
discuss how that feedback will affect the 1.0.3 release.  For those localizers
who haven't tested yet, please hold on trying out your locale.  Either I or Asa
will signal you when we can give you the green light for further testing.

It may get that chance.  Let's wait a little bit and see.

Chase, could you please give us an update about the state of the builds? It
seems that the April 8 builds were not final; We have to verify 5 builds on
three different OSes everytime a new release is announcend, so could you please
just drop a note here when you are done with your tests and sure that you will
ship the latest RC? That would save us a lot of useless work as you don't touch
the locales anyway.

It is partially because we recognize it takes so much testing effort by
localizers that we have avoided continuously notifying the l10n community
whenever we produce new builds.  We are in the process of squaring away last
changes and are extremely close to being code complete.  As you state, it's our
intention to mention in this bug when we're ready to have you all test and we
don't plan to sign-off until we're extremely satisfied with the quality of the
builds.
We took what we believe to be the last set of changes today and have builds that
we will begin preparing to release soon to our users.  I'm happy to report that
the Mac and Windows l10n builds are complete and are present in
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/aviary1.0.1-l10n-candidates/.
 Soon after the Linux l10n builds are complete they will be placed in this
location, as well.

Please test these builds to ensure they work as expected and provide any
feedback you have in this bug.  If all goes well we plan to issue the release
tomorrow evening.  Thanks!

Chase, what's up now with the localized versions? Users here in Germany are
getting pretty impatient, because the English version is available now for
almost a full day. I know you're very busy, but please try to serve the
localized version on mozilla.org as soon as possible.

I'm sure that's exactly what Chase is working on right now (yes, even on the
weekend)...
Thanks for doing all that work, btw.

Even on the weekend.  I had just made the webpage changes live for de-DE when I
got the Abdulkadir's bugmail.  I'm working on the next set of locales now, too.
Thank you very much Chase for the work, I didn't mean to bug you at all,

unless the Theme Manager in Mac build doesen't shows the deafult theme, is this

Again, I'm not the locale owner. The owner of zh-TW locale isn't availible right
now, 'cause the laws of Taiwan forces people at his age to attend the army for
several months. (Maybe we should have another owner to take care these work.)

According to Sarah, there were problems with the Linux and Mac sq-AL builds for
Firefox 1.0.2 (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=fx102l10n#c63).  

Assuming that nothing changed in the localization side, we were expecting to see
similar problems with Firefox 1.0.3 builds, but Marcia and I tested the latest
1.0.3 sq-AL builds and did not see any problems with bookmarks, menus, help, etc...

Besnik: Did you make any changes to fix the problems we saw in 1.0.2?  Because
things look ok now and sq-AL seems ready for prime time.  If you could test your
latest builds to verify our test results, that would be great.  Thanks.

Yes we did changes. Pike and Gandalf commited long waited patches which deal
with the issues Sarah found earlier. I did test them, but asked for approval in
 another bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=283378).
