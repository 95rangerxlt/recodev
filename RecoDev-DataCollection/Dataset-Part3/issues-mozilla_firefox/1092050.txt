Web console messaging related to weak signatures needs supporting documentation on MDN.

Web console messaging related to weak signatures needs supporting documentation on MDN.
Content should go here: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Security/Weak_Signature_Algorithm
As per dev-doc-needed flag in bug 1068949, I've created some MDN content explaining the message that appears in the web console. The messages in the web console have a "[Learn more]" link to this document.

Is this OK?
That would be great :) I'll link to that document from the Firefox 36 site compatibility doc.
Thanks
mgoodwin, I've also added a note on this in the Web Console page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Security_warnings_and_errors.

Would you mind checking it for accuracy?

Thanks!
That looks great, thanks.

One nit:
"See the  Weak Signature Algorithm for more details." is missing a word, maybe?
