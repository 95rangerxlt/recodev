That's because row is -1 here.

   9.107 +    aTree.view.selection.select(-1);

Don't use select(-1) here instead use:
aTree.view.selection.clearSelection();

   9.108 +    aTree.view.selection.select(0);
   9.109 +    aTree.treeBoxObject.invalidate();
   9.110 +    aTree.treeBoxObject.ensureRowIsVisible(0);
Felix: Can you fix this issue raised in the patch for Bug 275223?
Sure

Handle selection of null row onImageSelect

The sorting utility in gTreeUtils would, after a sort, do a row selection like select(-1) as a trick to force selection. onImageSelect picks up on that event and assumes it is a valid row selection (it is not). So, let's just check against that.

Handle selection of null row onImageSelect

Looks good to me, unless anyone sees a problem or scenario I haven't thought of.

You're just wallpapering over the issue. Other consumers of gTreeUtils would potentially have the same problem. Better to fix the problem at the source.

You should fix it in gTreeUtils.sort()
by replacing:
  aTree.view.selection.select(-1);
with:
  aTree.view.selection.clearSelection();

If you want to fix it in PageInfo then you need to audit all the other consumers of gTreeUtils for the same problem. Even then it won't prevent future consumers from running into the same problem.

Handle selection of null row onImageSelect

Replaced select(-1) with clearSelection. Tested out both pageInfo and permissions, the only two consumers of gTreeUtils.

Tested and confirmed that this patch fixes the error. However I'm not a Firefox/toolkit peer so I can only give you a f+. Over to DÃ£o Gottwald for a review since he's both a Firefox and a Toolkit Peer.
