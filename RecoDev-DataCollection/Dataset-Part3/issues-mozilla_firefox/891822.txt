The 'normal' icons aren't really visible because of the lack of contrast if the area behind the glass is dark. Inverted icons are what's used in Nightly, and those seem to work, contrast-wise, even if the glass window is over a pure white background.

part 0: fix alltabs-button styling,

So when I fixed bug 878551 I should probably alread have done this. Oops.
Created attachment 819700
invert toolbarbutton icons in tabstrip and menubar,

And here's an actual fix for this issue.
(I needed the alltabs fix because otherwise they were showing the entire Toolbar-inverted iconset because these rules are more specific than the existing alltabs-button rules. The button is constrained to the tabstoolbar now that bug 878551 is fixed, so there's no point in having the extra child selector stuff in those rules, so I fixed them)

It seems like this should be moved below to the -moz-windows-glass section otherwise this will also affect Windows 8+ where I would guess the same problem doesn't occur. 
(The whole  -moz-windows-compositor block needs to be checked for things that should move to -moz-windows-glass to fix colours on Windows 8).
