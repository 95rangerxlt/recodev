Hi.

Building Firefox will fail with the development GCC-4.3 compiler due to extra semi-colons in the code and the '-pedantic' flag. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install GCC-4.3 snapshot.
2. Configure and build Firefox.
3. Start 'make' and let things rip.
Actual Results:  
Build fails.

Expected Results:  
Build succeeds.

I'll attach a patch which removes the extra semi-colons in three files.

Patch removing extra semi-colons

Here's the fix.

Patch removing extra semi-colon characters

Here's a better patch - in addition to fixing the three files I found problems with in my Firefox build, I did a SeaMonkey build with GCC-4.3 and removed the extra semi-colons from files used during the building of the mail/news client.
Should have also added that the patch adds a missing newline to nsRssService.cpp; the lack of a new-line also causes GCC-4.3 and '-pedantic' to error out when compiling this file.
Confirming and reassigning since this has an r/sr'd patch.
" Patch removing extra semi-colon characters" checked in (with some trivial bitrot fixed). Clearing checkin-needed status.
Art's patch has been checked in and current trunk builds for me with GCC 4.3.  Resolving bug.
