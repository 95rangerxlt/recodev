On the latest Mac trunk nightly (20040915), the name "XULRunner" appears in
several places instead of "Firefox". Chiefly, the Application Menu name, and two
menu items within it ("Hide XULRunner" and "Quit XULRunner").

Last night's build (20040914) is normal.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:




I know that within the application bundle, in
Resources->English.lproj->InfoPlist.strings:

CFBundleName = "XULRunner";

I'm not sure if that's the cause, or just another symptom, though.

This is still in.

I suspect that the file involved is 'xulrunner/app/Makefile.in' but
it is not really my place to make a definite statement!
darin, did I review this?
This is wierd.  The Firefox build should not even be touching anything under
mozilla/xulrunner!
darin, the string in question is firefox, not xulrunner:

Yes, it appears from the CVS logs that I modified that file.  I'm not sure how I
managed to do that :-(

I've reverted the file to the 1.3 revision.  Tomorrow's builds should be better now.

Application name is now correctly shown as 'Firefox'. Thank you.
Great! Thanks Darin.
