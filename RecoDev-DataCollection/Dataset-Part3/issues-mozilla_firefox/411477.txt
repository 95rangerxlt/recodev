I thought this was maybe linked to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407852 but that reads as intermittent. I have tried it with many many tabs open and only one tab in a new window open.

If I  (Command / Apple) + T I open a new tab and the address/location bar does not receive focus for me to immediately enter an address. I have to then  (Command) + L to enter text there. Another bug posted that as an intermittent fix however I find Command+L always places focus in the address bar. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Command + T
2. Attempt to type URL

Actual Results:  
Actual result: No text appears, no autocomplete menu just a system sound meaning the active app is not receiving keyboard input.

Expected Results:  
Expected result: URL appears in address bar (or activates the new autocomplete magic) 

No themes. Firebug updated installed, however problem was apparent before this plugin was added.

I have selected this a major bug as it has dramatically altered my work flow and certainly has me using Safari more often as I Command+T a lot and don't think doubling my number of keystrokes is a minor problem.

I can't reproduce this.  I tested with today's trunk nightly
(2008-01-09-04-trunk).

See bug 407852 for the same issue on Windows. Might be cross-platform, in which case this bug would be a DUPE.
*** Bug 417741 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I have noticed over the past two days, since my Minefield last updated (3 March 2008) that this bug is not present anymore.
