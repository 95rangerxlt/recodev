Build ID: 20140212131424

Steps to reproduce:

Create at least 11 DOM nodes. (30 on the screen but I guess this will work for any count)
Get a NodeList of these nodes either by document.querySelectorAll or $$ or jQuery (works for any of this tools).
In developer tools add a watch for those nodes or simply view that array.




Actual results:

Results numeration is wrong:
0,1,10,11,2,3 etc


Expected results:

0,1,2,3,4...,10,11 etc if more nodes.

Please provide the html testcase not an image.

Here's an example HTML - actually it might work with any doctype and html, i didn't check. But for this attachment it works anyway.

Ok, if you mean the overlay when you hover the variable, it doesn't look like this has anything to do with html at all and is just about the variable inspector.

Yes, html does not matter much in the case. The case you've provided is using simple object - for object it's ok to not arrange its keys and I'm not sure why are the arranged for this case. Maybe this is another bug which is not related to pseudoarrays maybe not. For NodeList or jQuery collections they are pseudo-arrays and their numeric keys are expected to be arranged. 

I've tested the same behavior (both cases - simple object and NodeList or jQuery collection) - for Blink and IE the keys are 0,1,2,3,4....,10,11.

variablesview-dont-sort-nodelist.patch

Here's a patch that fixes the issue for NodeList. It also contains a test case that ensures none of the specified array types (VariablesView.NON_SORTABLE_CLASSES in browser/devtools/shared/widget/VariablesView.jsm) are not sorted.

This should be: function* runner

Here's a patch with the correct definition for "function* runner". Hopefully the long name doesn't cause any issues.

Here's a revised patch that calls the correct clean up function (finishTest instead of finish) in the attached test case. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks for the updated patch. I'll land it when the try run below finishes successfully:

Indentation is off in these 2 lines, should have been indented up to "string" in the line above. I'll take care of that before landing.
