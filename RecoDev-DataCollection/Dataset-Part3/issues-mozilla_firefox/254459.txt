1.  Visit a site such as cnn.com that will throw up a popup
2.  Confirm that you get the notification line 'Firefox prevented this site from
opening a popup window. Click here for options."  On Windows this notification
is highlighted in light yellow and the icons are the same in this notification
line and the status bar.  On the Mac, using the default theme there is not a
clear color distinction, therefore it is very difficult to see see the notification.

When I switched to using a different theme (Noia 2.), the notification bar
looked fine (yellow background was present) and the icons in the notification
and the status bar at the bottom were the same.

adding asa to this bug. I think this should be nominated for 1.0 since the user
experience won't be good for Mac users since it is difficult to even distinguish
that a pop up has been blocked. 
taking
fixed on branch. sorry for the bugspam
