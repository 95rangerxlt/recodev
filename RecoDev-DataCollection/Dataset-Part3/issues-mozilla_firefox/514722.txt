remove undeeded directory

There is a directory (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/64da35bd0d16//Makefile.in#l196) that is created.  Up until now, these directories were inside the builder directory in our buildbot configs.  We are changing how buildbot manages source code and as a result these directories will start building up in places where they will not get deleted.  Apparently it is a left over directory.

This patch removes this directory.  A simple search of MXR "$(topsrcdir)/../$(BUILDID)" and "../$(BUILDID)" show that the directory is only referenced in the Makefile.in that I am patching.  If this directory is in fact needed, would we be able to move it to somewhere in the objdir?  It would be ideal if it were landed on the branches.

Leftover, doesn't actually do anything. I forgot to delete it when I fixed bug 478221.

You'll need separate approval for 1.9.1, but I can't grant that.
