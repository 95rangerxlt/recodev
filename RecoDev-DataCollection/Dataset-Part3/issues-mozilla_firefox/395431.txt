patch v2: removes extraneous link

This version is just like patch v1 except that a link to the Content:File Types section, which no longer exists, has been removed.

patch v2: removes extraneous link

Thanks! I wish everyone changing the UI would update the help docs accordingly like this :-)
Only a couple of minor points:

>+<p>The <em>Applications</em> panel lets you choose applications to handle
>+  different types of content (e.g. PDF documents).  It shows you a list of
>+  content types and lets you select a handler for each type.</p>
>+
>+<p>You can choose a local application to handle any type.  For some types, you
>+  can also choose a web application to handle the type, save the type on your

For some types, you can also ... save the type. Can't we save everything to disk? If "for some types" only applies to web applications, you should move that to the end.
Do we have other "features" besides the feed preview? Maybe we should add that as an example.

I'd like the visibility of the options to be improved. Put them in a <ul> like in the doc you removed, like so:
<li><em>Use an application</em><br/>
 To choose an application to handle a content type, select the type from the
 list.  The currently-chosen application for the type will turn into a menu.
 Open the menu and select the application you want to handle the type.</li>

patch v3: review fixes, additional polish

"for some types" actually applies to all three options: web apps (which can't handle MIME types), features/plugins (we only have a feature for the feed type, and plugins can only handle MIME types, and there may not be a plugin for every type the user encounters), and save to disk (we don't know how to save content identified by protocol scheme types to disk, and web feeds don't support being saved to disk automatically).

That's the only one.  Adding it as an example seems like a good idea.  I have done so (and linked it to the glossary description of the feature).

Good idea.  I have done so.  I also updated the text to be more consistent and readable, and I linked items to glossary entries where appropriate.  Finally, I updated menu_reference.xhtml, which contained a references to the Feeds preference panel, to refer to the Applications panel instead.

patch v4: fixes bugs in last patch

The last patch had a few bugs in it (an extraneous closing tag and a few entities not closed with semi-colons).  Here's a patch with those bugs fixed.
Requesting wanted-1.9 for this Applications prefpane polish fix.

How about "If you want ... to handle the type, select <em>Choose Application...</em> and point &brandShortName; to its location."?

Hmm, that contradicts the Chicago Manual of Style's recommendation for words following colons in sentences, which says to lowercase that word.

http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/CapitalizationTitles/CapitalizationTitles35.html

Isn't "Note:" introducing two sentences here, rather than being part of the first sentence?
We've capitalized the following word in three other locations, so I'd prefer to be consistent:

Hmm, I see your point.  Now that I read it again, it does seem to be introducing both sentences.

I think we should follow the Chicago Manual of Style and lowercase the following words in those three cases, but that's another bug.

I'll capitalize the following word in this patch.

Good catch.  I have done so (and nixed a few other tabs from the files in the process).

If not yet keyboard-friendly, it should be possible to make it so.  But yes, this is another bug.

Ok, done.  And I did a bit of reflow to make the lines look nicer now that they are indented more.


> How about "If you want ... to handle the type, select <em>Choose
> Application...</em> and point &brandShortName; to its location."?

Sounds good.  I did that, but I left "from the menu" in the sentence, since I use that phrase in all the other sentences where I talk about choosing an item.  So now the sentence reads:

If you want a local application that is not in the menu
to handle the type, select <em>Choose Application...</em> from the menu
and point &brandShortName; to its location.


> >+<p><strong>Note:</strong> when a plugin is available 
> capitalize "When", please.

Yup, capitalized.

Since bug 396989 has landed, I also changed "Save to Disk" to "Save File", and I removed the ellipses from that option, since it doesn't have ellipses.  I also corrected the grammar of one of the sentences by adding "to" to the end of it, so now it reads "Otherwise, when you encounter the type, &brandShortName; will prompt you for a location on your computer to save it to."  And I added myself to the list of contributors to prefs.xhtml.

This is the version of the patch I'll check in.  Requesting approval to check this in for 1.9.
Please bump the date at the bottom of prefs.xhtml to the date of the checkin.
