After bug 1090949 (I think), removing a simulator from the Add-on Manager page leaves the runtime in WebIDE's list if it was already open.

STR:

1. Open WebIDE
2. Look at runtime list
3. Open about:addons
4. Remove some simulator add-on
5. It will still be displayed in the runtime list

Jan, this is a minor regression from before I believe.  If it's easy to fix, it may be worth doing.  Setting ni? since you'll be out for a few days.
Thanks for catching this! Actually this problem will be fixed by bug 1090949, which improves the way the Simulators list is updated.

The problem stems from the fact that addon status is not taken into account when building the addon list. [1] Because `AddonManager.getAllAddons()` returns addons even if they are disabled / recently removed, these still get added to the list.

Does this problem still occur?

No, it seems to be fixed, thanks!
