Right now we can only show one popup notification icon at a time, which causes a problem if there are multiple notification on a page, such as the password manager notification and the geolocation notification.

Also, this prevents us from creating multiple persistent indications, like in this mockup: https://bug634065.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=513594.

The current PopupNotifications API makes this tricky. This patch works, but I'm not sure I like the way I handled the case where the iconBox is the notification anchor. I modified the anchorElement getter to use #default-notification-icon as the anchor if it exists, but it seems bad to place a dependency on that ID in PopupNotifications.jsm. However, it will still fall back to using the iconBox if that element doesn't exist, so this patch shouldn't break anything.

Oops, this won't work. I'll change it to:

.notification-anchor-icon {
  -moz-user-focus: normal;
}

.notification-anchor-icon:not([showing]) {
  display: none;
}

No, this bug still exists. Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to work on it in a while. Also, at this point, I'm not sure what the design for this is supposed to look like.

Jared has been doing some work near this area of the location bar in bug 588270, so I'm cc'ing him. However, I remember this bug being kind of tricky, so I don't know if he'd have time to work on it either.

Nice, this is looking good. The changes in the patch look like they make sense to me, but it's been a while since I've worked with this code, and I remember there were often tricky edge cases to watch out for in here.

I made a build with this patch applied to test it out, and it's working pretty well. However, I found that if I visit a page with multiple notifications immediately after launching the browser, I get into a weird state where the notifications are combined into one panel (I will upload a screenshot). I also found that sometimes clicking on the default icon doesn't open the arrow panel as it should.

In case it helps, I made a testcase that shows a geolocation notification and an indexedDB notification: http://people.mozilla.com/~mleibovic/test/multiple-icon.html. We'll probably also want to try to add testcases for multiple notifications to browser_popupNotification.js: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_popupNotification.js. I also bet generating notifications from a privileged scratchpad could be a good way to play around with testing this.

Umm... I think:

>        });

The checking |n.anchorElement == anchorElement| is removed from this part. It'll causes your reported bug behavior. 

|PopupNotifications.prototype._refreshPanel()| is make popup notification panels from |notificationsToShow| array.
If no checking |n.anchorElement == anchorElement|, _refreshPanel() will make some notifications without considering anchor element.

And I think that, the current implementation of _refreshPanel() is not clearly. This implementation may be useful for making many same icons(e.g. showing 2~3 geolocation icons) from array without build-in xul:image.notification-anchor-icon .
But the current PopupNotifications design need to set xul:image.notification-anchor-icon before the fact.

It has not a consistency between overall design and local design. We may need to clean up them.

I can fix to be failed "browser_customize_popupNotification.js" soon.
I write a my fixing idea about this fail.

It may be difficult to fix "browser_bug553455.js".
I have not get the plan to fix it yet... The timing to show popup is too severe. I still have not been able to debug it fully.

Fail "browser_popupNotification.js" is related to showing popup. Maybe, this is caused with same bug of fail "browser_bug553455.js". I have not researched yet.
It may need to change all logic..... :(

This part should be check |n.anchorElement != null|. n.anchorElement sometimes returns null.

Is your review meaning this ?:

.notification-anchor-icon {
  -moz-user-focus: normal;
}

.notification-anchor-icon:not([showing]) {
  display: none;
}

.notification-anchor-icon[showing] {
  display: -moz-box;
}

No, I meant just what I wrote.
I forgot to remove "showing" attribute from icon element when user switch a tab.
I'll fix it & add its test into a next patch.

patch v6

This patch fails tests.
However, this patch pass tests if we fix this patch as following:
  // Test multiple notification are shown
  { // Test #21

    onShown: function (popup) {
+     window.setTimeout(function(){
      checkPopup(popup, this.notifyObj2);

      // check notifyObj1 anchor icon is showing
      isnot(document.getElementById("default-notification-icon").boxObject.width, 0,
            "default anchor should be visible");
      // check notifyObj2 anchor icon is showing
      isnot(document.getElementById("geo-notification-icon").boxObject.width, 0,
            "geo anchor should be visible");

      dismissNotification(popup);
+     }, 2000);
    },

So this failing will be not caused by this patch changeset. It is a latent bug of PopupNotifications.jsm or its test codes. We should fix it. But I have not found the bug point.
Please review this patch, and What should we do about this bug?

You can get rid of this hasAttribute check, since calling removeAttribute won't cause any problems if the element doesn't have the attribute, and it's not more expensive than calling hasAttribute.

uber-style nit: I don't think factoring these strings out into constants helps with clarity or maintainability, and it makes it harder to see what the code is doing without having to look up the constant value, so I think you should get rid of these.

It might be even clearer still if you used the hidden property, although I don't know whether you would want to initially hide the icons in script or in markup.
