Opening WebIDE and connecting to Chrome with the Settings page open in a tab I get this error and the tab list fails to appear:

JPM error JavaScript error: chrome://webide/content/webide.js, line 1219: TypeError: chrome://settings/ is not a valid URL.

That line contains:

1219:      let url = new URL(tab.url);

The debugger is much less strict in handling tab URLs:

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/debugger-panes.js#1793

Can't we do something similar here? Note that Chrome devtools properly open and debug such pages, just like we can debug about: pages.

At the very least, we should try/catch around that line and continue with the rest of the open tabs.

Hmm, it seems the platform explicitly blocks new URL() from parsing chrome:// URLs. :/ Any random scheme name works, so chrome must be banned for some reason.

Anyway, we should make this work one way or another.

Don't let WebIDE break when trying to debug Chrome settings

It turns out that chrome: URLs are parsed properly, but only those that are actually valid for Firefox (which chrome://settings is not). Therefore I just ignore these URLs, since I can't think of a way to debug them properly.

I couldn't write a test for the same reason: using something like chrome://webide/content would work even without the patch and using chrome://settings would throw when trying to create the tab in Firefox.

Review of attachment 8572635:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Looks good to me, especially if these pages can't be debugged.
Otherwise it would be better to fix that code to be able to display a meaningful label instead of skipping them.
Also, may be valence should only expose the tabs it is able to debug?
Both good points. It turns out that these pages can indeed be debugged, it's just the tab list that can't handle them. I have a fix in Valence for this and I'll land this patch as a safeguard that WebIDE never breaks in the presence of an invalid URL.
Here is the change I mention above:

Can you review that too, please?
