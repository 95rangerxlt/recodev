When following the instructions posted on the Mozilla.org web site for compiling
a Mac build of Mozilla and adjusting .mozconfig to build Firebird, only a
dynamic build can be created. When looking in the MacOS folder of the
application file one sees that there are only aliases to the various libraries
instead of the true library files. Currently, disabling dynamic builds, and
enabling static builds in .mozconfig just causes the build to crash before an
application file is created. Therefore, the only builds of Firebird for Mac are
dynamic, requiring anybody who wants to run these Firebird builds to have Fink
and all necessary library files installed on their system for Firebird to be
able to launch.

Reproducible: Always

if this is a bug on the *incorrect* linking of fink libraries in a non-static
build screwing up distribution this is a dupe of bug 216908...

beyond that if you have some other reason to build static please provide more
details of where you are failing so individual issues can be
considered/evaluated/fixed.
Jim,

fix for bug 216908 has been checked in. please try and build with your exising
config and see if there are still any problems
