When I attempt to import Saved Form History data from Internet Explorer in 
this nightly build, the import process hangs and apparently is not doing 
anything. There is no CPU usage from Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to import IE saved form history
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Importing... window appears, but never goes away, nothing appears to happen

Expected Results:  
Form history imported successfully

I'm seeing this on a new install.

Successfully imported IE saved form history without problem.
I did an import of IE form history empty and with IE containing form history info.

Perhaps it's a Win NT bug?
I'm using Windows XP (NT 5.1 is what XP shows up as in the User-Agent). 
Clearly it's something related to the system configuration or something, since 
it crashes 100% consistently on my machine.

I tried the latest nightly build, but it seems rather badly broken for me - 
the import window crashes before opening, as does the About dialog..
To clarify, the hang isn't happening for me with 1.0PR, rather I get a crash 
when I try to import saved form history. This function has changed behavior 
several times in different versions (either crashing or hanging up) but it has 
NEVER worked on this machine.
No longer happening with recent nightly builds:
