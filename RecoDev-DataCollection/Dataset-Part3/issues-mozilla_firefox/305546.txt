Steps to reproduce:
1. Add the "New Window" button to your toolbar.
2. Drag the following text to it: javascript:alert(12345)

Result: An alert appears from nowhere (near the top left of my screen), then a
new browser window appears.

Expected: The browser window should appear first, and the alert should be a
sheet on that window.

This isn't specific to the New Window icon, it happens anytime you try to open a
javascript: link in a new window (via the open location dialog, for instance).
The loadURI call in browser.js happens onLoad, so I'm not sure that this is
something that can really be fixed... short of moving that to delayedStartup,
which would have a pretty bad effect on page load time.
This can be triggered by websites with e.g.

  window.open("javascript:alert(4)");

assuming the popup goes into a window and not a tab.

dveditz says "odd, but not dangerous".   I think I agree.
Checkin for bug 351633 fixed this.
