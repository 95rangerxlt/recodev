Maybe the same issue as NTT (http://www.oxymoronical.com/web/firefox/nightly) menu broken after customising the navigation toolbar, specifically after removing the throbber.
Removing localstore.rdf fixes it until I open 'Customize toolbars' again.

That bug is similar to bug 414907: menu is broken for the same reason Bookmarks icon is broken (see bug 414907 comment 11). patch for bug 414907 should fix this bug.
