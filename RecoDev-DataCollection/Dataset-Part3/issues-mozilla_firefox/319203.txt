I'm attempting to have one XPI file that gets installed as an extension and can be installed with the wizard on Windows.

I've discovered a major bug with the installer code that prevents this (it worked in 1.0.7)

The code here:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpinstall/src/nsSoftwareUpdateRun.cpp#503

fails to account for the case where we are in an install wizard and hence can't get an extension manager so we should run the install.js.

As a result, we simply get unknown error if an XPI contains both an install.rdf and an install.js

ARGH.

Fix for problem

If we failed to get extension manager, try install.js. We are in a wizard install.

As far as I know, there is no other reason getting extension manager should fail...

Per bsmedberg - we can check to see if we are a stub install if we call nsSoftwareUpdate::GetProgramDirectory

I really need this for FF 1.5 CCK.
Let's get it landed and regression-tested on trunk.
There have been no reported regressions from this on the trunk and it is working as expected.

I have tested XPIs with install.js and install.rdf being installed as part of the installer as well as through the browser.

Please consider for 1.8.1/FF2.  1.8.0.1 is intended for major stability/security updates.
And actually, this does fit the criteria. This was a major regression.
This is a regression from 1.0/1.7

I Should have added an alias IsStubInitialized() for readability. That's what this is really testing, mProgramDir is null unless StubInitialize() has been called.

Does that mean this is checked into the trunk? If so please mark FIXED.
This was checked in on trunk.

a=dveditz for drivers.
Please add appropriate fixed1.8.0.1 and fixed1.8.1 keywords when checked in to branches
checked into both branches
mkaply:  Do you have a test xpi we can use to verify this fix on the 1.8.0.1 branch?  Or if someone on your team can verify this on the branch and add the keywords, that would be great too.
