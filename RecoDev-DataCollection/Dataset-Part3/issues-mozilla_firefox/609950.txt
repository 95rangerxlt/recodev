This is what I had in mind. It includes some unrelated cleanup to HCO_observe.

Cool. Nice and clean.

We can also remove the registerDisplay code that stores the hudID mapping, since it's no longer used. This includes Mihai's test from bug 613013.

The patch looks fine.

Comments:

-    // get the window Id
-    var windowId = this.getWindowId(aContentWindow);
-    this._headsUpDisplays[aHUDId] = { id: aHUDId, windowId: windowId };
+    this._headsUpDisplays[aHUDId] = { id: aHUDId };

Oh oh, looks weird. This should be removed entirely, but the removal of _headsUpDisplays would require more work.


+    if (!(aSubject instanceof Ci.nsIScriptError))
+      return;
+
+    let hudIds = ConsoleUtils.getHUDIdsForScriptError(aSubject);
+
+    switch (aSubject.category) {

Why not move the call to getHUDIdsForScriptError() in the default case? The other cases are ignored anyway, so no need to waste execution resources to find the hudIds for messages we ignore.

Also, if you see fit, I think the test from bug 598438 should be added as well, since it's related (good to catch future regressions).

Yeah, it is weird. We'll revisit it for future cleanup.

Good catch, made that change.

I have a couple of issue with that test, I'll followup there.
