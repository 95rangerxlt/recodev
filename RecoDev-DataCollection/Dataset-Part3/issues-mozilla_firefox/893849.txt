We should make sure the search box always takes up the full width of the panel, and a default width once you move it back to the navbar (unless you move it straight back in the same process to when it was next to the navbar, in which case we can probably resize it to match its previous size?)

This is about the menupanel, not the overflow panel.

(also, to fix this properly it needs to be treated like the other wide panel widgets, which I'd like to fix by generalizing their onWidget* handlers into a single one that fixes the entire panel's ordering, which I'm working on in bug 885579)
You may want to block Bug 918551 on this one.

search box should fill entire width of panel, part 1: change class name, apply to search box,

This is pretty straightforward, but it isn't enough because if you've used the splitter to change the widths of the urlbar and searchbar, that width persists into the panel or palette. However, it does that now, too, and this patch makes things strictly better (and makes it possible for the Add-on SDK to use this class, too) so I want to get this out of the way while I figure out how to best deal with the width issues...

I didn't land this bit because it's a no-op. New patch to fix the width coming up in a sec, which also removes the rules for the edit/zoom-controls.

Simpler than I thought in the end. This works.

This is how it currently looks like for me. So the box is now a bit too wide (or needs even margins). Shall I file a new bug, or do you intend to cover this in this bug?

Can you make a screenshot including context? I'm guessing you had the right edge of the window at the edge of the screen, which means this looks like bug 874792 to me - everything is lacking margins, which is because the "keep this panel onscreen" bits have made it narrower on the right side. This is also why the quit button looks cropped. :-(
Yeah this is due to the window reaching all the way to the edge. If I move the window to the left, the margins look good. 

Definitely needs to be fixed before Release, I guess most people are running Fx fullscreen (because mostly they have about 13" displays) â€¦ well, Bug 874792 then. Thanks!
