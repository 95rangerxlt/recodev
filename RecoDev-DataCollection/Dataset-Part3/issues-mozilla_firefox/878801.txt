Silly me introduced another uninterruptible reflow while fixing bug 875257. The BrowserNewTabPreloader must not query window.gBrowser.boxObject when opening new tabs or else this will again cause us to flush pending layout changes.

part 1 - introduce nsIDOMWindowUtils.getBoundsWithoutFlushing()

This patch adds .getBoundsWithoutFlushing() to nsIDOMWindowUtils which is the equivalent to DOMElement.getBoundingClientRect() without flushing pending layout changes.

part 2 - query tabbrowser bounds without flushing layout
I forgot to note that it's totally ok for the BrowserNewTabPreloader to work with bounds that are possibly not up-to-date as we're optimizing for the average case where a user does not resize their window every time before opening a new tab (even if so there's a good chance something else will flush the layout for us). The code does still work with "incorrect" bounds.
