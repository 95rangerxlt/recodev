MDC has pages for every CSS property. If would be a valuable source of help for users of all levels to have direct links from the style panel to the MDC pages. For non-English users, linking to MDC pages in their native languages would be useful (though it's unclear if MDC will handle this easily for us today).

Each style property name is already clickable. So, we will make a link appear when the user hovers over the style property name that will link to the MDC page in the user's locale (assuming we have confirmation from the MDC folks that this will fly).

I have confirmation from Eric Shepherd that the UX for linking to localized MDC pages for style properties is not going to be good at this stage. There is a rework of MDC in progress, but it's unclear exactly when we can expect to see that.

So, at this stage, for this bug, we just want to link to the English pages.

Proposed fix. The UI certainly needs improvements, but I did not have any better ideas. As discussed, Limi will certainly make awesome improvements to the UI.

Cool, thanks Joe! Can we mark this as FIXED then?

I just got a reminder about this outstanding review. Sorry I missed it at the time, but I'm guessing there's not much point in looking at it now.
