Actually I can recreate this, but with slightly different steps.

1. Right-click on a bookmarks toolbar folder ("Smart Bookmarks" will do); Observe that "Sort by Name" is enabled
2. Right-click on a blank area of the Bookmarks Toolbar; Observe that "Sort by Name" is enabled.
3. Right-click on a bookmark item in the Bookmarks Toolbar; Observe that "Sort by Name" is NOT greyed-out (see Bug 400447)
4. Right-click on a blank area of the Bookmarks Toolbar; Observe that "Sort by Name" is greyed-out.

What I think is happening here is that a flag setting "Sort By Name" to be true(enabled), which is triggered if the item being clicked is a folder - is not being reset until the next "is this a bookmark or a folder?" check.

However, testing this out by creating a new folder on the toolbar and dropping 3 or 4 links into it proves that the incorrectly-enabled blank-area-of-the-toolbar-"Sort by Name" does not actually sort the last-clicked on folder.. as I had suspected it might.
Damn, typo in Comment #2.
Step #3 SHOULD have read ".. Observe that 'Sort by Name' *is* greyed-out.."
As of 2007121505 my Win32 build has changed its behaviour from what I described in Comment #2. Now "Sort By Name" is *always* enabled when clicking on a blank area of the toolbar.

This Bug is now obsolete; I filed Bug 408545 to continue...
Using build 2008050506 I just noticed that 'Sort by Name' *is* missing from the context menu.

There is NO blank area of the the toolbar for me as I have the address bar on the left side of the 'Bookmarks Toolbar' and the toolbar bookmarks folder on the right side of the 'Bookmarks Toolbar'.

This bug is still completely relevant and needs to be fixed!
the only case where i see sort by name disabled is after reordergin the toolbar so id appear related to bug 433542
(In reply to comment #0)
The problem with STR in comment #0 has been fixed by Bug 401247, and can't be reproduced now (per Comment#4).
So this bug should be marked as RESOLVED.

If related problem remains, it should go to the new bug.
I cannot also reproduce with recent Linux trunk build.
I will be marking fixed.
Thanks Sakai-san.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
