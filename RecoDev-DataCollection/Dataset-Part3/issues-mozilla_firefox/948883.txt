With the current plan to harden the security of Firefox, we want to disallow internal privileged pages to use inline JavaScript. Since their amount is fairly limited, we start this by rewriting them bit by bit.

I think the inline scripts for toolkit/content/aboutSupport.xhtml had already moved into 
toolkit/content/aboutSupport.js .
checkin-needed means that there's a patch that needs landing.

Yes, it seems that we don't need to fix anything about this file. Thank you for checking, Georgiana!
I think we're overlooking something here ;)
I see a lot of onclick and style attributes that should be merged into aboutSupport.js and aboutSupport.css respectively.
Oh, yes. Sorry I forgot about those.

Your CSS patch should work, but you could consider creating two classes (one with display:block and one with display:none). And assign those to the elements instead of unique IDs.

You have introduced a CSS class "hidden", I think you want to use it here.

Looks good from here. Let's get a Toolkit module peer to review!
I have added the CSS class I missed, should I add another attachment?
Ah, right I forgot that part. Please obsolete the previous patch, carry over my "feedback+" rating and ask Blair for a review on the new patch.
Thanks! :)

Always use addEventListener() to handle events.

Also, you can shorten these lines a bit. This file defines a $ function, which is just document.getElementById(). So you can do:
  $("show-update-history-button")

Mozilla code always uses 2 spaces for indentation - you're used a tab characters here.

For cases like this, you can simplify by just registering this function as the event listener:

  document.getElementById("copy-to-clipboard").addEventListener("click", copyContentsToClipboard);

Typo here - missing the end quote at the end of the id attribute value. 

But also, this shouldn't have the "hide" class. The original inline style never had display:none, so adding it here is changing the behaviour.

Convention is to name this class "hidden".

Can you post the full diff? This is changes made on top of your other changes - what we ideally want is changes to a clean tree.

The reason being is that it's hard to review just a diff of a diff - generally reviewers want each revision to be a complete standalone diff, to see the whole picture. We have tools to get an interdiff (diff between two revisions of a patch) when it's useful.

Awesome :) Good to go!
Doesn't apply to fx-team.
Hi, just wondering what the above comments means? Are any changes needed? 
Thanks! :)

This patch doesn't apply cleanly against current fx-team tip (https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/) 
i guess because this patch has no newline at end of file, but current fx-team has newline at eof.
