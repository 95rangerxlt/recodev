regression from bug 350675
I can't reproduce this, and it's nearly impossible that the change from bug 350675 would have caused those symptoms. Are you sure this isn't a regression from some other bug? Are there any JS console errors with showInConsole set?

no problem with 090912 [cairo].
regression between 090912 and 090920. 
all search engines are gone, and OK/Cancel buttons in search-engines manager are no reaction.

in error console,

I backed out bug 350675 locally and search engines are still broken, so this was caused by something else
1.9a1_2006090913 still worked fine. 
This was caused by the JS engine change, Brendan is working on a fix.
Should be fixed by brendan's checkin, please verify.
