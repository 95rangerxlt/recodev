Right now the most potentially confusing part of the install for someone new to computers and screen readers is that the radio buttons for license agreement don't behave as one might expect.  In order to check the "I Accept" radio button, one needs to arrow down, then back up again.  Changing this to a check box would be much more clear.  I could be wrong, but I thought Thunderbird used a check box at one point.  I haven't been able to find it looking through some prior versions though.
If this is as easy as it sounds, it is worth doing for Firefox 3.

Tim, I don't believe that Thunderbird or any other toolkit app ever used checkboxes but it is easy to do. We also have a couple of other options such as using an I agree button. I'll provide examples of the different options via links in this bug in case one of them is better for screen readers than using checkboxes.

setup.exe using a checkbox
Tim, attachment #280215 is an example using an "I Agree" button and attachment #280216 is an example using a checkbox. Could you try out both of them and let me know which one provides the better user experience with a screen reader? I will also need to run this by cbeard to make sure the change is ok for our EULA. Thanks!
Robert,
Actually it seems both those attachments use a checkbox.  It works well, though.  It's very straightforward and also has a keyboard shortcut.
I would be inclined to go with that over an I Agree button in any case.

Thanks for your help.


Tim,
Sorry about uploading the same file twice and thanks for the verification. I should be able to get this done soon after the tree opens.

I think "check box" might need to be "checkbox", but I'm not sure.

Looking in mxr (for .dtd / .properties files), I saw both "check box" and "checkbox".

From what I have seen in other installers it is usually spelled "check box"... I suspect we use checkbox at times internally due to the xul element, etc.

Can we get this and other installer a11y changes in mail, SeaMonkey and all the other Mozilla-related products that use this installer?
I mean, we could file a separate bug for each, but why? :)
Settings like this are per app and require each app's review process. I have some other changes to finish up and will file bugs for this after this weekend.
*** Bug 343660 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Was there a reason why the MUI_INNERTEXT_LICENSE_BOTTOM_CHECKBOX string was not deleted from the installer files? Just wondering as we're currently porting this fix to SeaMonkey installer.
I think you mean MUI_INNERTEXT_LICENSE_BOTTOM_RADIOBUTTONS. I didn't remove it in case we ended up going back to using radio buttons for whatever reason. There is no code size cost for having them defined. Typically with NSIS all of the strings are included which makes it simple to make changes like this but l10n asked me to minimize the number of strings.
