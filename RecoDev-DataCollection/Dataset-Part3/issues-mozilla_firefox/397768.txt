Patch rev. 1

This fixes it for me on Linux. Not tested on other platforms.
I can test this on Windows, and land it on the trunk.

for "// XXX Todo: |description| is not saved.", I've logged bug #397771

I have not yet able to reproduce the original problem on windows, but I can still test the patch.

note, since we check if name or url are non-empty, this patch should not hurt windows (if we make another pass once moreData is false).
mats, can you elaborate on what bookmarks you are creating in opera and where?

I'm using Opera on 9.23.

Can you attach your opera6.adr file to this bug, or email it to me?

opera6.adr (Linux)

> can you elaborate on what bookmarks you are creating in opera and where?

Using an empty home directory:
1. start Opera 9.22 on Linux (click through licenses etc...)
2. visit http://www.dn.se/
3. Bookmarks->Bookmark page...  click OK in the dialog that opens
4. visit http://svt.se/
5. Bookmarks->Bookmark page...  click OK in the dialog that opens
6. quit

The resulting opera6.adr is attached.

I tried the same on Windows and compared the opera6.adr files and the
only difference I can see is the different line endings, the file
ends in \r\n\r\n on Windows vs. \n\n on Linux.
The reason for the different behaviour is deep down in NS_ReadLine.
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/netwerk/base/public/nsReadLine.h&rev=1.8&root=/cvsroot&mark=160,168,169-170,195-196#136

For the last line ending on Windows (\r\n) we will enter the block at
line 169, Append an empty string, iterate again and return on line 168 -
|*more| will be true in this case, causing an extra call by consumers
that loop it's false.
This is different from Linux where the last line ending (\n) also enter
the block at line 169, Append an empty string, but then exit the loop
since we ran out of buffer data, causing a new Read on line 191 (to check
for \n\r), it's not, so we return on line 196 with |*more| == false.

Thinking about this for a while I don't really see an error with the
above, but I guess we could lie (remove line 195) to make it behave
the same regardless of which line ending is in use.
(alternatively, peek 1 char if we find \r\n at end-of-buffer)

BTW, line 167 is pointless, AFAICT.

> BTW, line 167 is pointless, AFAICT.

I think it's an early carryover of an early patch iteration when eolStarted was a member...

As for the rest, we could change this to be consistent, sure.  But the consumer here is obviously incorrect before this patch: nsILineInputStream clearly documents that a false return still means you have to process aLine if you want to read all the data.
On second thought, I do think we should fix the \r\n handling to not effectively pretend that there is another blank line.  Mats, you want to do it?
Sure, filed bug 397850.
