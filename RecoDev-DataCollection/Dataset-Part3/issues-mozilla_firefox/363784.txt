Persisting the 2nd xpi is bad, because other partner builds which don't have one will "magically" pick up the last-used one (the kodak gallery in this case).

Don't persist the second xpi in the repackager
Hrm, I'm not sure this is the right solution. We *do* want to persist the value when you launch the GUI, and we don't want to persist any values when using --silent.
Opening for :bs.
I had meant to assign this to myself, not :bs, so it fell off my radar.

I'll take it and work on a revised patch.
Benjamin, I see this is already fixed in the CCK repackager!

Thanks.
