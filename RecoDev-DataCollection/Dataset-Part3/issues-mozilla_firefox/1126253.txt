+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1125497 +++

At the top of browser/base/content/browser-thumbnails.js, we import NewTabUtils.jsm because some code in browser-thumbnails.js wants to use NewTabUtils. We can remove this import, because browser.js already imports NewTabUtils.jsm (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/38e4719e71af/browser/base/content/browser.js#l29).

I've always wanted to land a bug and learn how this works and this seems like a good one to learn on. :dao are you the mentor?

Sorry, that's the wrong way around. We need to remove the import from browser-thumbnails.js, not from browser.js.
so I think I have this figured out (what to change for the appropriate patch) but I am confused on MozReview on how to submit this patch and I can't seem to find you (:dao) on irc
