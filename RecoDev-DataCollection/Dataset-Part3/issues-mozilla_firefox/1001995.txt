This can become confusing for stylesheets, for example after bug 997131 this won't work as expected:
> /* these are so the identity box doesn't jump around when going back/forward in the tab history */
> /* remove: these aren't needed in FF31 */
> window:not([chromehidden~="toolbar"]) #urlbar-container[forwarddisabled] > #urlbar-wrapper > #urlbar > #notification-popup-box[hidden] + #identity-box > #page-proxy-favicon,
> window:not([chromehidden~="toolbar"]) #urlbar-container[forwarddisabled][switchingtabs] + #urlbar-container > #urlbar > #notification-popup-box[hidden] + #identity-box > #page-proxy-favicon,
> /* end remove */
> window:not([chromehidden~="toolbar"]) #urlbar-wrapper > #forward-button[disabled] + #urlbar > #notification-popup-box[hidden] + #identity-box > #page-proxy-favicon {
> 	-moz-margin-start: 0;
> }

That's because, even though the forwarddisabled attribute is no longer set or actually used, #urlbar-container is initialized with it:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser.xul#642

Also, a couple of leftovers that will be affected when removing that attribute:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/osx/browser.css#3382
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/windows/browser.css#2277

Dao, once again I'm CC'ing you directly because you were assigned bug 997131.

Sorry, I should have been more specific. What I meant was we can't differentiate between both "versions" of this style through the stylesheet alone, because the forwarddisabled attribute still exists after the patch.
Good find.
