ian, can you participate, and round up any others that might be helpful so we could do a quick review?

I'll suggest next Monday afternoon pacific time, and I can set up conf. call and meeting room for anyone that can attend here in mt. view.

If we discover any areas of vulnerability as part of the review we can spin off tracking bugs from this one.

Next Monday afternoon works for me.
Sounds good; Monday afternoon works for me as well. CC-ing some others who may or may not be interested.
Sounds like Monday is a holiday in the US.  How about Wed. at 3p pacific?

Holiday!? The Panorama team doesn't have holidays! ;)

I'll be getting out of an appointment just around that time... would 3:30 pacific work?
ok, I'll set that up and we can adjust if needed.
3:30 Pacific on Wednesday works for me as well.

Yup, that's about what we've got...most of it's not terribly up to date, unfortunately. At this point the most reliable source on what Panorama does is Panorama itself. 

There's also the code documentation:

Is there a wiki page for the security review?

This bug is the definitive source for this review as far as I know (I'm new to this process).

In the past we've linked to pages on the wiki:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Reviews/Firefox4#Front_End
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Reviews/Firefox4/Tab_Panorama_Security_Review
I guess since we've done the review, this bug is resolved? I don't really know how this works, so please re-open if that's not the right thing to do.
