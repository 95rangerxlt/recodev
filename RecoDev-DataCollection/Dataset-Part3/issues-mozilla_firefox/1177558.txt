Make sure you have "record allocations" checked. Restart firefox after checking.

STR:

* Open perf tool
* Go to https://swannodette.github.io/todomvc/labs/architecture-examples/om/
* Start recording
* Click "benchmark 1"
* Stop recording
* Go to allocations tree

ER:

Allocations appear ("benchmark 1" definitely allocates)

AR:

Nothing there. Nor in allocation charts.

This is from trying to offset the docshell timestamps by a Date.now() in the memory actor, leaving us with wildly negative numbers. Saving this for when the performance actor is a real actor, to make things way easier.

Moved logic that fixed this from bug 1172180 to here. The docshell timing is weird how we do it, but that's how we do it everywhere else, and if it's ugly, it's because we should clean it up everywhere
