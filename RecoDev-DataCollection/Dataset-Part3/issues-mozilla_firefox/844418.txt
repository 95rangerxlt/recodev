Step 3:Create a new file or just make a change to the old one.
Step 4:Save it and the close the "Style Editor" by right-end top bar control (X).
Step 5:Go Back to Tools >  Web Developer or Just Web Developer.

There are more simple STR:

1) Open Firefox > Web Developer > Style Editor
2) Save a style locally
3) Close Style Editor via the close X button
4) Go to Firefox > Web Developer

Result: Style Editor is still checked in menu.

In addition, it's not reproducible in FF22 (dev tools have a new UI integration).

Thanks for the report.
I think we have 2 fixes for this, although it's hard to remember which versions they are in. Firstly I think we have a fix for exactly the menu problem you talk about in FF20, secondly the new Toolbox window is in FF21.
