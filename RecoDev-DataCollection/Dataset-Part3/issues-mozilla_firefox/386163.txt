Using canvas in all cases simplifies the code and makes the whole experience a bit smoother, as the image doesn't have to be reloaded (even if it's only from cache).

Before I can post the patch, I need the patches in bug 385844 and bug 385503 to be checked in.

This will also fix bug 385717.

Dão: can you inline the <html:canvas>? Hopefully flex="1" on a html element inside a xul box works...

patch v2

This contains a couple of more changes. Most importantly, I reorganized the ifdefs (e.g., OSX didn't use updateColor() and non-OSX didn't use observe()). The plain diff is quite chaotic, hopefully bugzilla's side-by-side view makes it easier to follow.

I needed the straight opposite; see the new comment in the xul file.
+    //XXX set the dimensions explicitly to prevent canvas from going crazy
+    this._canvas.width = this._canvas.clientWidth;
+    this._canvas.height = this._canvas.clientHeight;

is this issue filed/tracked somewhere?

After thinking about it I wouldn't consider this a bug, since width and height control the size of the coordinate space. I should change the comment.

changed to:

Comments updated and <groupbox id="preview" align="center"> reverted to <groupbox align="center">. I hope that makes sense.

"var", otherwise this will throw on OS X.

You've mixed the monitor_16-10.png images, see http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser/ and http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/.
Should be better now.
Litmus Triage: marcia will cover test case.
