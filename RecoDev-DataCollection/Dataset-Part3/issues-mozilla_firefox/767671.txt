STR:
1) Open the Developer Toolbar
2) Type: inspect body

Expected results:
Keyboard focus remains in the Developer Toolbar so I can type a follow-up command

Actual results:
Keyboard focus is given somewhere else (not sure where).

The keyboard flow of using the Developer Toolbar is broken as I now have to either hit Ctrl+Shift+V twice (bug 767670) to get focus back in the Developer Toolbar or use the mouse to give focus back to the toolbar.
Fixed by the landing of the developer toolbox.
Please re-open if you disagree.
