Sometimes when some files are loaded too early, race conditions happen. For instance, if `toolkit/devtools/server/child.js` is loaded too early, `Cu` might not be defined. If `toolkit/devtools/server/main.js` is loaded too early, `Promise` is not defined, and so on.

This caused an intermittent failure in the gaia integration tests, so we should fix at least those two races.
