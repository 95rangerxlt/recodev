Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:18.0) Gecko/18.0 Firefox/18.0 beta 1

There is some extra space above the documents in PDF Viewer.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a PDF document
2. Scroll up

Expected result:
You shouldn't be able to scroll up when opening the document (the beginning of the document should fit the content window top)

Actual result: 
You can scroll up a little, so that there is some space between the window top and the beginning of the document.

See attached screensot.

Note: This is only reproducible on Firefox 18.0 (beta). Firefox 19.0 and 20.0 are not affected.

Can you find if this was ever an issue on the Firefox 19 Nightly builds? If it was, that means it was fixed at some point and we can possibly uplift the fix. Otherwise this bug will be WONTFIX and have to ride the trains.

It's fixed by bug 801280.

Landed for Firefox 19 on mozilla-central. Unless we plan to ship PDF.js in Firefox 18 I'd say let it ride the trains. 

Alex, do you think it's worth uplifting the fix?

Yep - Brendan is planning to back pdf.js out of FF18 instead opting to let it ride the trains for FF19.
Pdf.js will be disabled for 18. So as long as this is fixed 19 I'll mark it fixed by bug 801280.
