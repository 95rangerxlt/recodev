the tab strip and location bar buttons

The native GTK drop-down arrow isn't drawn in the center of buttons. It's off to the right by a few pixels.

It's noticable in the back-forward drop-down, the tab strip, and the location bar.

Using the Ubuntu Human theme, the tab strip one has 10 pixels on the left side and 7 on the right.
I'm not sure about the location bar since it's 5 on the left side and 5 on the right. Centering cannot be achieved with a symmetric arrow icon. (Maybe that's a different bug).

patch

Remove the margins set by the not displayed label and image in the toolbar buttons where there is only an arrow: the back-forward-dropmarker and the tabs-alltabs-button toolbar buttons.

s/image/icon/ and both of these are already display: none, so this isn't necessary.

r=me sans the above change - sorry for the delay!

The arrow is still little bit moved to the right side of button.
