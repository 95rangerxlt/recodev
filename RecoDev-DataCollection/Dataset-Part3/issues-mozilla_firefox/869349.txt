In latest Jamun builds when I click the download button the previous-forward conditional buttons are separated in two (the forward button isn't conditional anymore).

What is the contents of your browser.uiCustomization.state pref?

{"placements":{"PanelUI-contents":["new-window-button","privatebrowsing-button","print-button","history-panelmenu","add-ons-button","preferences-button","save-page-button","find-button","developer-button"],"TabsToolbar":["tabbrowser-tabs","new-tab-button","alltabs-button","tabs-closebutton"],"PersonalToolbar":["personal-bookmarks"],"nav-bar":["unified-back-forward-button","urlbar-container","reload-button","stop-button","webrtc-status-button","bookmarks-menu-button-container","search-container","bookmarks-menu-button","downloads-button","social-toolbar-button"],"toolbar-menubar":["menubar-items"]},"seen":[]}
Note that it also make the new tab button disappear.
Sorry for the triple post but it's much more general than I thought : opening an arrow panel clicking on a button (bookmarks, download) make the new tab button disappear and break the unified back-forward button.
I can't reproduce this on a clean-ish profile btw.
Are you able to reproduce this with the same profile on a UX nightly?

I've cleaned my profile and the issue is gone. I will reopen this bug if I meet this problem again.
Maybe something is wrong with me, but I've tried with a clean profile and it issue is still there. Even when you switch back to Nightly, it brokes everything:

I'm reopening it, because I've encountered the problem on another config. Steps to reproduce : new install of Jamun add the bookmarks button to the toolbar, click on the download button.
Yep, I can reproduce with this STR. Thanks ge3k0s!
Pretty strange - clicking on the downloads panel causes all toolbaritems to get wrapped. Not sure why just yet.
Correction - the items aren't getting wrapped (or at least, they don't end wrapped) - but the currentset of the toolbar has them in wrappers.

For example, here's my nav-bar's currentset attribute after the STR:

currentset="wrapper-unified-back-forward-button,wrapper-urlbar-container,wrapper-reload-button,wrapper-stop-button,wrapper-search-container,wrapper-webrtc-status-button,wrapper-bookmarks-menu-button,wrapper-downloads-button,wrapper-home-button,wrapper-social-toolbar-item"
Interesting. This actually looks like a foul-up from the step where the user moves the star button to the toolbar. The currentset's are being persisted to localstore.rdf with the wrapper IDs, and then when we use loadOverlay to lazily load up the download panel stuff, bug 640158 rears its head, and the localstore.rdf attributes are re-applied. So the wrapper IDs are put into currentset, and the CSS that makes the unified back/forward and new tab button work no longer apply.

This was easier than I expected. We were persisting the currentsets *before* we'd unwrapped all of the items. D'oh.

I've tried the last Jamun build but the problem is sadly still here.

I *think* you can fix this by either:

1) Entering customization mode as soon as the browser starts, moving something around, and clicking "done"
2) Deleting your localstore.rdf
