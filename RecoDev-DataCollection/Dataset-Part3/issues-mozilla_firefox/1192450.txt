We discussed this on IRC, too. Looks "good", in that it fixes the issues we want fixed, and will have to live with not having a whitelist for now.

The contract for application/x-shockwave-flash -> text/html is a "sign" that we already handled the Shumway-is-on preference(s). See also comment at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1179262#c6 about the decision made at bug 1179262.
