How --opt=<value> looks like

Hm, that doesn't look very good. What about "[--opt=<value>]"? I see that in a few manpages. Or maybe use the command name between angle brackets like "--delay=<delay>"?
Bug 833092 is about improvements to the hint system. We should strongly consider this idea as part of that.
