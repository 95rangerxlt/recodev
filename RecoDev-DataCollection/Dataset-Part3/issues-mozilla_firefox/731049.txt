============================================================= 

Happened while trying to reproduce bug 730796 with the following browser-context ScratchPad script:

<SNIPPET>
if (!window._earlyObserver) {
   Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm");
   let o = window._earlyObserver = {
     QueryInterface: XPCOMUtils.generateQI([Ci.nsIObserver, Ci.nsISupportsWeakReference]),
     observe: function(s, t, d) {
       if (d.indexOf("://www.mozilla.org") !== -1)
          gBrowser.removeCurrentTab();
     }
   };
   
  Cc['@mozilla.org/observer-service;1'].getService(Ci.nsIObserverService)
    .addObserver(o, "content-document-global-created", true);
}
content.location.href = "http://www.mozilla.org/";
</SNIPPET>

Consistently reproducible.

Feel free to WONTFIX it if closing a tab at that time is considered unsafe anyway (please also document what else is unsafe in such an observer, though).

The summary seems cut off. What are the exact steps to reproduce?
