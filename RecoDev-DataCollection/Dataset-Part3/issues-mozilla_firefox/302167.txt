Manager. It's mentioned in customization.xhtml.

To install an update, you now have to click the "Update Now" button for the
respective extension:

In fact when you click on "Find Updates" it looks for updates for the selected
extension only. It doesn't check for all extensions like it should.

s/behaviour/behavior/

The spelling you're using there is en-UK, not en-US. ;-)

Other than that, everything looks okay assuming this is actually how it works. 
I don't install themes, and I don't have access to old themes with waiting
updates to test.
Yeah, that's how it works now.

addons.mozilla.org offers previous versions of extensions and themes, e.g.
https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/moreinfo.php?id=166&page=releases
Try e.g. SphereGnome 1.0.9.5.
Checked in, with s/behaviour/behavior/ in both places.
