Filing here as it seems a bit weird / I can't identify what changes between the two nightlies to explain the change in behaviour.

Something appears to happen between:
2009-09-01-04 and 2009-09-02-04
that breaks the Add Script... button and hides the user scripts (those
already added seem to work)
(in Firegestures - Options | Mapping)

(Have emailed the author and attempted to cc here but bugzilla didn't recognise the address)

Error: item[kNameCol] is null
Source File: chrome://firegestures/content/prefs.js
Line: 293
Firegestures 1.5.5.1
http://www.xuldev.org/firegestures/develop.php

seems to resolve this
I'm still unclear what between those dates caused the problem.
