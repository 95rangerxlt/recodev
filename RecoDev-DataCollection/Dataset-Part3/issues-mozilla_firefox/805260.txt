In IRC, dmose reported he is playing with the social stuff and using browserid for auth.  This process seems to involve the sidebar (and possibly other content) redirecting to browserid.org (and presumably back again) as part of the process.  However, this causes errors in the jsconsole:

dmose: Error: [Exception... "'Error: MozSocialAPI: cannot attach http://webrtc-social.herokuapp.com to https://login.persona.org/communication_iframe' when calling method: [nsIRunnable::run]" nsresult: "0x8057001c (NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_JS_OBJECT)" location: "native frame :: <unknown filename> :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 0" data: no]

We should tone the wording down and issue a simple wording instead.  Something like:

"The social content for http://webrtc-social.herokuapp.com is loading content from https://login.persona.org - the navigator.mozSocial interface will not be available in this window until it returns".

Or even just do nothing completely silently!  Either way, dmose thought it represented a real problem.

It's an error if we fail to do it for some other reason, but "wrong domain" should just be a warning as you suggest, yeah. I'd leave out the part about "until it returns" since that just seems confusing.

patch

I moved "enabled" check out of attachToWindow and removed the reported error for that, since it should never really happen in practice.
