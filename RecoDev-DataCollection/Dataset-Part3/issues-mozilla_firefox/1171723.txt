* Run this in the console: let a = {a:1,b:1}; inspect(a)
* Search for 'b' in the variables view search box

Expected:
All object properties are visible

Actual:
The filter is still applied ('b' is the only prop visible)

Fix clear button in variable view.

The xul textbox being used here, doesn't dispatch `input` events when we click on the clear button.
But it does dispatch a `command` event. Other tools are listening to this event.
It also has the benefit to merge multiple keypress into a single event once user stops typing.

Do they have to press 'enter' for the event to fire, or does it automatically fire after they stop typing for some amount of time?
It automatically fires after you stop typing.

Looks fine to me.  Needs minor rebasing on the test files

Could you just call aElement.doCommand() instead of using this function?

Fix clear button in variable view

Same request as bug 1169096. This patch goes along with it. If we don't include this additional fix, bug 1169096 behaves badly.
