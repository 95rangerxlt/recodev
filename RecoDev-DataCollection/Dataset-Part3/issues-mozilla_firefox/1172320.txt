Build ID: 20150604162752

Steps to reproduce:

I use the browser content toolbox a lot, but it is quite hard to access it.
I like using the accesskeys (like Alt-twe in order to access the Browser Toolbox), and I'd like to be able to do so for the Browser Content Toolbox, like Alt-twx.

Paul, I am not sure you're the right person to ask a review for that, but I think that could be quite easy to review :) (unless the accesskey choice has to be discussed).

Thanks in advance!

Pff, not even having tested before submitting my patch, sorry. Patch updated and works now.

Nit: can you line up the "x" right below the previous string value?

Done

One last question: is a try-push mandatory in all cases? (for this patch, it doesn't seem useful to make a try-push, but maybe the process is strict about it?)

Thanks in advance

I've seen weird unrelated breakage before when changing keyboard shortcuts, but I think in this case you would be safe to request checkin without a full try run.  From https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tree_Rules/Integration#What_are_the_tree_rules_for_integration_repositories.3F:

Integration repositories are no replacement for Try. You still need to test your patches before pushing. (This doesn't mean that you need an all-platforms try run for every patch. But it does mean that you should do enough testing so that you rarely cause red or orange on the integration repository. But breaking it rarely is ok. Never missing a plane means you're spending too much time in airports; never breaking the tree means you're running too many tests before landing.)
Can you please make sure that future patches include your name and email address as well? If you run ./mach mercurial-setup, it'll help you do that.

Sorry, I thought I have already done that, but I'll check that.
