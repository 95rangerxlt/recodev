Now that places isn't in 2.0 anymore, we should revert the changes to bookmarks.html.

We should sneak in the changes in our URL structure, though. Maybe as two steps.

Bookmarks shouldn't contain traces of places, IMHO, even on the trunk.

Also, to add to the reasons why places should be disabled, you just can't add bookmarks in places like before, when it wasn't places.  It looked better the old way.  Even more, the Add Bookmark command (dialog) in the Bookmarks menu looks appalling.
kbblogger@verizon.net : although you might have been confused by Axel's technical comment about how "Bookmarks shouldn't contain traces of places," this bug, and any other bug for that matter, is an inappropriate place for that comment. The newsgroup if you have something constructive and useful to offer, forums.mozillazine.org if you want to complain until a moderator quashes you, but not Bugzilla.

Revert to 1.5.0

Given the different review needs between "this structure won't break Places" and "these are the URIs we want to keep around," two-stepping it sounds reasonable. This patch just goes back to the 1.5.0.x bookmarks.html, which seems to work just fine trunk and branch, Places and not (as it should, since the importer has to deal with it being created in 1.5 and then imported).
Can you also add a link to mozilla.org? I don't think we should remove a link to our community apparatus.

Revert and fixup v.1

Okay, let's get it in one shot.

- added m.o/contribute/
- fixed the mostly-incorrect LAST_CHARSETs
- changed m.c/products/firefox/central.html to /firefox/central/ (twice)

Leftovers from bug 310625:

- http -> https for addons
- icons for Answers.com, Wikipedia, Sfx
