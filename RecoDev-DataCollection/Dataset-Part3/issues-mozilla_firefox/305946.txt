Using a MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH firefox CVS tree pulled today, the file
mozilla/browser/base/content/browserconfig.properties is installed as a symlink
that points to the file in the build dir.  This does NOT happen in 1.0.6 under
identical build conditions.  A 1.0.6 install includes the actual file.

The exact install command from the build log for the 1.8 branch build is
**
/sw/src/fink.build/firefox-trunk-1.1-11/mozilla/config/nsinstall -L
/sw/src/fink.build/firefox-trunk-1.1-11/mozilla/browser/base
./content/browserconfig.properties ../../dist/bin
**

This install command is not seen in the 1.0.6 build log.

The relevant file seems to be mozilla/browser/base/Makefile.in, which was
changed from using a perl preprocessor to config/nsinstall around the time this
started (see bug 282057).

Reproducible: Always

Created attachment 193980
makes browserconfig.properties be a file and not a symlink

changes the dangling symlink to be an actual file
Should point out that this is in both trunk and in MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH builds.
Fixed on a fresh branch CVS pull.
