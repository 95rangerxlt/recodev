components/libdbusservice.so is missing from the Linux package.
Should be added to browser/installer/unix/packages-static, I guess?

patch to add the component.
It seems the file list is not really sorted so I just added it to the end of that section.

Not exactly an idea if that's build config or browser component. So just guessing the reviewer

reset blocking request -> not needed anymore
I think SeaMonkey probably needs this as well.
Probably, but I wonder how the mail component would interact with it.
In mailnews going offline would probably try to sync/download messages while it would fail since the connection is gone at that point already.
So the component as it is might need to be revised for that?
I think we already handle online/offline signals on other OSes, and on self-built Linux installations.
So, all in all, please add this to SeaMonkey and Thunderbird as well, AFAIK we all can deal with those network messages, and if not yet, we should do so anyways.

Not sure if this is the right spot...

I don't see a unix-specific packages file for Thunderbird. I only see mail/installer/windows/packages-static...
Looks like TB is currently packaging everything in dist/bin/ on non-Windows so nothing to do here.

Thanks. As long as it's within [browser], it can only be "the right spot" in terms of the resulting package ;-)
