fix downloads.js warning

During startup, there's a JS warning generated by downloads.js (twice):

JavaScript strict warning: chrome://browser/content/downloads/downloads.js, line 1440: anonymous function does not always return a value
JavaScript strict warning: chrome://browser/content/downloads/downloads.js, line 1440: anonymous function does not always return a value

The attached patch aims to fix this, to reduce Terminal noise for people working with debug builds.

fix downloads.js warning

Hey Jonathan - thanks for the patch!

This is already being taken care of in bug 809852 - the error will go away once that patch lands.
Jonathan:

Now that bug 809852 has landed, can you confirm that the warnings are gone?

-Mike
Yup, thanks!

Resolving as fixed (by bug 809852).
