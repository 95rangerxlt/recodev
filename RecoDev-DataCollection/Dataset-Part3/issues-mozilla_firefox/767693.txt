When bug 735987 was fixed I forgot to save the modified block list to disk after unblocking a site. This can lead to the issue described in bug 735987 again when restarting the browser because the 'unblock' modification is lost.

I don't see a |block| between the |simulateDrop| on line 17 and the |resetCache| on line 20, so I'm not sure if this test is actually reproducing the problem that this patch is trying to fix.

Shouldn't this be:

> checkGrid("0,99p,1,2,3,4,5,6,7");
> NewTabUtils.blockedLinks.block("about:blank#99p");
> NewTabUtils.blockedLinks.resetCache();

I checked that the test is failing without the patch applied.

The block() call from line 14 is important. This should be undone with the simulateDrop() call from line 17. We check this by trying to block again on line 24 and see if we were successful.

The only difference here is that I simulated a user restarting the browser by just clearing the BlockedLinks cache and opening a new about:newtab instance.

To explain again, we're checking if unblock() is working when dropping a blocked link onto the grid. block() is definitely working as assured by other tests.

OK, that makes sense now. Thanks for the clarification.
