Droppable it is!

Other than that:
 * Make sure we list the currently set microsummary for a bookmark
   synchronously if any. I will file a follow up on also using the current
   generatedTitle until we get a fresh, live, title.
 * Don't rebuild the menu-list for each microsummary change.
 * Some code cleanup in the microsummary service; in particular, do not expose
   setters for attributes marked readonly in the interfaces.
 * Add equivalence-test method for microsummaries.

after applying the patch, i was no longer able to install microsummaries. after installing one, the ms file on disk was empty, and i got this error:
************************************************************
* Call to xpconnect wrapped JSObject produced this error:
  *
[Exception... "'[JavaScript Error: "setting a property that has only a getter" {file: "file:///Users/dayala/moz/newplaces/build-dbg/dist/MinefieldDebug.app/Contents/MacOS/components/nsMicrosummaryService.js" line: 1320}]' when calling method: [nsIDOMEventListener::handleEvent]"  nsresult: "0x80570021 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JAVASCRIPT_ERROR_WITH_DETAILS)"  location: "<unknown>"  data: yes]
************************************************************

the microsummary i used was: http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/test-microsummary.xml

and the test content for it is: http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/test-microsummary-content.php

(which is just a script that changes the microsummarized content each time it loads)

This also stops setting per-object fields in the prototype.

so, this breaks microsummary installation on non-places-bookmarks builds (works fine for places-bookmarks). this check fails:

if (typeof window.sidebar == "object" &&
    typeof window.sidebar.addMicrosummaryGenerator == "function")

no errors in the console. the page is stuck at "Loading...".

a couple of nits:

>         microsummaries.AppendElement(microsummary);
>       }
>     }
> 
>+    // If a bookmark identifier has been provided, list its microsummary
>+    // synchronously if any
>+    if (bookmarkID && this.hasMicrosummary(bookmarkID)) {
>+      var currentMicrosummary = this.getMicrosummary(bookmarkID);
>+      if (!microsummaries.hasItemForMicrosummary(currentMicrosummary))
>+        microsummaries.AppendElement(currentMicrosummary);
>+    }
>+

the "if any" comment looks like an unfinished sentence...

>+  /**
>+   * Determines whether the given microsumary is already represented in the
>+   * set.

>+  hasItemForMicrosummary: function MSSet_hasMicrosummary(aMicrosummary) {

>+    return false;
>+  },

nit: weird property name, wouldn't |hasMicrosummary| do (like you have in the function name..)? also, the property name and function name should match.

After the check-in of bug 373362, this works fine. Sorry for the confusion.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
