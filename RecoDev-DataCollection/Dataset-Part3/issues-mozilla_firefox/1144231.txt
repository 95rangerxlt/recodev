in bug 1081343, browser_polaris_prefs.js was added.  While testing stuff locally, I ran into this test case as failing when run a second time, this is because the prefs are not reset at the end.

cleanup preferences at the end of browser_polaris_prefs.js (1.0)

On line 45, just add:

registerCleanupFunction(function () {
  Services.prefs.clearUserPref(POLARIS_ENABLED);
});
Oh no, not on that line. One sec.
Just add that to line 40 I guess.
