If you view PDFs documents full-screen, you can't scroll with the mouse and you can't change page with the up-down arrows or with mouse clicks.
To me, the full-screen mode looks more like a "presentation mode", if it's actually a presentation mode than mouse scrolling isn't needed (but we should change the name and the icon of the button).

While you can use up-down arrows or scroll mouse in normal mode, you can't use this in reader/presentation mode. This problem can make user feel discomfort/ strange when they need change page. this feature also have in other pdf reader/presentation mode such as foxit and powerpoint. this bug didn't fixed.
I am sorry. This bug is fixed
