I create a simple table using php and a standart loop to show information about products - and there is always an image inculded to this information.
Since the webpage its self is under development i can´t paste a link, but the image should show the problem.

I searched the bug-website for this problem but could not find a hint about the problem.

IE6 / IE7 / IE 8 do not show this problem -.-


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page with product listing
2. Pictures are missing in part or completly

I was playing arround a bit with this problem and found some strange behaviour:
- when i right-click on the image / above the image and the context-menue shows up sometimes the images under the context-menue are (after closing it) displayed correctly
A link to a page with the problem or a minimal testcase is really needed.
