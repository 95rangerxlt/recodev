> Mark, don't suppose you could take another look at this? :-)

I am, constantly :)  Also the other chat one :)  It's proving very hard for me to track down - most recent attempt is an instrumented try run with prlogging forced on for the focus manager (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=8709aaa3ec02).  If I can't nail it early next week, I'll disable that specific test.
Thank you for the update :-)

Use a load event on iframe.contentDocument to make the callbacks

What I've found is that sometimes DOMContentLoaded on the XBL binding is firing before the content is loaded - which is bad, as this probably means providers will tend to rely on the DOM being available in the chat window, and very rarely it will not be.  The fact we are adding the event listener to the chat panel itself is probably responsible for this.  By adding a 'load' event listener to iframe.contentDocument, this problem is avoided.  Note that for reasons I don't quite understand, it is necessary to add the content load listener inside the chatbox's DOMContentLoaded listener, otherwise it never fires.

A side-effect of this is that it fixes bug 833207 for chat windows - the 'load' event doesn't fire when our about:social-error page gets loaded, hence the patch includes a change from todo_is() to todo() for that specific case.
Removing [disable-me 2013-04-01] just incase felipe takes a few days to review.

Use a load event on iframe.contentDocument to make the callbacks

Review of attachment 730544:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

drive by.

- seems like we should check that this._callbacks is not null before iterating on it (since we're setting to null)
- socialChatActivity is broken due to missing bind(this) on the load handler fn.
- I dont think we need to use domcontentloaded, simpler to just use load with fourth param: 

  iframe.addEventListener("load", function{}.bind(this), true, true);

r+ me with that
> - seems like we should check that this._callbacks is not null before

I don't think this is necessary - it has always been this way and never caused a problem.  It can only cause a problem is DOMContentLoaded fires twice, which would be bad in other ways, so I don't see a need to guard against this (as if we ever hit it, we'd want to fix the underlying problem rather than guard against just this)

> - socialChatActivity is broken due to missing bind(this) on the load handler

I'm not with you here.  DOMContentLoaded doesn't use .bind(this) as |this| is correctly the chatbox.  load does use .bind(this).  Note we also have explicit tests for socialChatActivity which still pass.  So could you elaborate on the problem here?

In what way is that simpler?  Or are you saying you have tested it and it avoids the need for *both* DOMContentLoaded on the chatbox and load on the iframe's contentDocument?

Why would the fourth param be needed? That's "accept untrusted events", and it wouldn't make sense to observe untrusted "load" events.

When I was initially testing, I was getting the load event hit twice, resulting in an error when trying to iterate on this._callbacks.

Look at the code.  everything inside DOMContentLoaded is using "this.", but the function is not bound to the object.  I'm not clear how any of it worked at all since in this case "this" would be the function.

It avoids the need for both. And iirc, we use load elsewhere so the document is loaded to handle the frameshow/hide events.

I believe that you do not receive dom events from content without the fourth argument. I could be wrong, perhaps that is only if you listen on the parent of the iframe.

yeah, I was wrong about that, sorry.

Do you still see this, or see it during the tests?

It works as |this| is the XBL element to which the listener is added (ie, the chatbox.)  Did your testing show a problem?

Right, but the 2 listeners are on completely different things.  Adding the load to the iframe content document before DOMContentLoaded fired for the chatbox didn't work for me.  I'm not sure on what object you are saying only a "load" will do - what specifically worked for you?
Created attachment 731928
working patch

This patch works.  I do get two loads.  The dump statement in chatActivity only shows up when the load handler is bound to this, so *something* is different with |this| when you haven't bound.

If you listen for load on the iframe itself, you do need the 4th param to receive the event.  However, listening on the xbl component works fine.

Created attachment 732150
updated based on Shane's

Shane's patch does show how I can capture content load without the nested handlers, which is great.  I removed the superfluous .bind(this) as it isn't necessary (almost all chat tests would fail if it was) and incorporated the test change.

I thought we were switching to the load event.
From IRC:

1:27:31 PM - markh: hmm - it does seem to work ok sticking with DOMContentLoaded
1:27:48 PM - markh: (but doesn't "fix" that "error callback" - but that's ok)
1:28:38 PM - markh: so - let's do that - the more minimal the better, and sticking with DOMContentLoaded seems better (ie, no need to wait for images to load I'd think)
1:29:30 PM - felipe: and is it ok to not fix that todo_is?
1:30:09 PM - markh: sadly there are other todo_is() for the same thing, but for panels. So it only fixes that todo_is() for chats, not other cases
1:30:42 PM - felipe: ok
1:31:00 PM - felipe: well, up to you! either version is fine
1:31:10 PM - felipe: if you feel more confident with this one then go with it
1:31:13 PM - markh: so some other fix would be needed to totally fix it anyway - presumably checking the location in the load handler.
1:31:34 PM - markh: well - it seems "less is more" when it comes to fixing random oranges...
1:31:41 PM - markh: if it was a "real" fix I'd feel different
1:31:47 PM - felipe: :)
missed out on some of that conversation, so I thought the commit was wrong.  closing.
