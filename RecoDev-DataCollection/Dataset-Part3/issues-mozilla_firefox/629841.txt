There is a type of button that seems to have unnecessary margins, with the following effects:
- horizontal spacing between buttons becomes irregular (8px, 10px or 12px depending on the combinations--should be 8px everywhere);
- when in "Use Small Icons" mode, adding one of those buttons to the nav bar makes the nav bar higher than it should be.

The kind of button with the faulty margins is a “combo” button (left part is a simple button, right part shows a drop-down list). It seems it’s only used by extensions, and said extensions include Firebug, Readability, Total Validator and others.

I suspect most buttons have margin-left:4px and margin-right:4px, while the nav bar itself has a global 4px padding. (Implementation might be different, I haven't looked at the code yet.)
The problem buttons have 6px of left/right margin (instead of 4), and perhaps 3px of top/bottom margin instead of 0px (or 7 instead of 4).

Reproducible: Always

Screenshot of the issue
By the way, I tested with:
- Firefox 4 beta 11pre (nightly 2011-01-28) on OSX: bug still there.
- Firefox 4 beta 11pre (nightly 2011-01-28) on Win7: no similar bug.
Seems specific to the Mac theme.

patch

Icons & text mode is affected as well, this takes care of it.
