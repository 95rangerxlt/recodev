oops, need to change region.properties, not brand.dtd

--> alpha3 as a blocker, also making this a dependency of the rebranding bug in case that one is ever used as a reference of what to do when rebranding.
Created attachment 221901
one line change to /browser/locale/chrome/en-US/browser-region/region.properties

the sort of patch beltzner can handle :)
I've got a better patch in bug 337823.


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 337823 ***
until bug 337823 is resolved, can we get this less elegant fix checked in?
Ok, but we must not forget to back this out before shipping 2.0, or to check in my patch from bug 337823.
Checked in on branch.
