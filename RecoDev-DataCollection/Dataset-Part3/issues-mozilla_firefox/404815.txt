I cannot open a new tab by wheel click (middle click) on the links of web pages with 2007112106-trunk/WinVista. However, I can open on bookmarks.

This regressed between 2007111905 and 2007112005.

Do you have any extensions?  There are multiple extensions that broke from Bug 398609 which should be fixed by bug 404499.  And that was one of the symptoms I had come across from a broken extension.
Brian:

You're right. When I disabled the SubmitToTab, I cannot reproduce this bug.

Is this should be a dup of bug 404499? or should depend on bug 404499?
bug 404499 fixes this.

-> FIXED
