In print preview, clicking the center mouse button somewhere off the previewed
page, such as near the vertical scroll bar, does not display the auto-scroll
icon as expected.  Auto-scroll does work as expected though but without the icon
indicating such.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. File > Print Preview
2. Single click center-mouse button outside of previewed virtual page and move
mouse up or down

Actual Results:  
Page scrolled as expected, but icon missing from screen

Expected Results:  
Showed the auto-scroll icon on the screen at the location of the center button
mouse-click

Not getting _any_ autoscroll in Print Preview, myself. Inclusion would make
sense as features such as Page Source and Help allow autoscroll.

Could this be something related with

Yes, autoscroll is available on print preview, but if there is more than 1 page, and you hover your mouse over the actual page(s) when you scroll, the scroll will stop once you reach the bottom of the page.  If you hover your mouse in the grey area on the right next to the scrollbar, however, then you can scroll all the way down from page 1-X.
Can you verify that this is still a bug with a trunk nightly build from tomorrow?  If it is not, it was most likely fixed by bug 242621.
This is now indeed fixed in current trunk build on windows.
However, the popup shows up at the wrong place, I filed bug 384914 for it as a follow-up.
I'm marking this bug fixed (by bug 242621).
