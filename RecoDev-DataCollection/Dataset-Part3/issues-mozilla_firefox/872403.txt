No idea how I got to this, but the currentset for my menubar is "menubar-items,". Note the trailing comma. When we restore legacy state at the moment, we just split by "," - so we get an array of ["menubar-items", ""]. That final empty string breaks things. We should have a sanity check there.

Drive-by:

My inner language-geek is in love with this. :) Still, I think it's worth a comment to say what's going on here. Arrow functions are new enough that (IMO) it warrants a short explanation of what it's doing.
Doesn't look like there's anything preventing this from landing, so I went for it.
