The test yammer provider appears to be using an icon larger than we expect.  When you enable yammer the toolbar grows in height to fit the image.  When you switch back to facebook the toolbar shrinks back to its correct size.

Note we should not consider this a bug with the yammer provider - we should arrange for the image to be resized (or possibly cropped) regardless of the original size supplied by the provider.

Use list-style-image for the provider image

It looks like list-style-image should be used for the provider image too, along with -moz-image-region.  I'm not sure about the gnomestripe change - I suspect this change will make the nearby rule:

 #social-provider-button > image {
   margin: 5px 3px;
 }

not work as intended with this change.

Yeah, this should work. I'm not worried about that other rule.
