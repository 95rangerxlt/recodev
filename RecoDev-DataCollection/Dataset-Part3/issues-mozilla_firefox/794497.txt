I'm sorry I don't have STR.

Using Aurora 17.0a2 on Mac 10.7.5 I'll often find that the console just stops working after a I've been using developer tools for a long time.

The first couple times I noticed this happened after I had accidentally launched Firebug.

So I've disabled Firebug, but I still hit this occasionally. This is very frustrating for developers as they may think they have a problem with their code and aren't hitting the part where they log.... when actually it's just that console.log doesn't work.

Is this still happening?
I haven't seen it lately.
