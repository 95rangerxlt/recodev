This is a regression from bug 795556.  Here's what happens.  If you leave PB mode when a page is loading, the code at the beginning of _onBeforePrivateBrowsingModeChange sets the docshell flag on everything to false.  Then we call into sessionstore to restore to a blank slate, which means that we'll stop network activity on that tab.  Then the progress monitor code in browser.js sees that, thinks that the network load is done, and sees that there's no favicon loaded, so it calls tabbrowser's useDefaultIcon, which tries to load the {url}/favicon.ico file.  At this point the tab lacks the private bit set, which means that the favicon for that page gets loaded in non-private mode.

This sucks.  These sorts of race conditions will go away once we move away from the global PB mode, but for now we need to set the flag after the sessionstore goof in _onBeforePrivateBrowsingModeChange happens when you're leaving PB mode.

Hmm, doing that does not seem to be enough.  Investigating why.

That is because the concept of boolean variables is not entirely understood by me.  ;-)
