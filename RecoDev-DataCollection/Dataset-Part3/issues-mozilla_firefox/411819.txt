Works pretty well for me on trunk if I turn off extension compatibility checking, but it triggers a bunch of warnings and other console output in debug builds.
Trunk version of Greasemonkey works fine for me on trunk version of Firefox.
FYI, one problem with Greasemonkey 0.7 on FF3 is that the tools > Greasemonkey > new user scripts... feature throws an error in Windows (not other platforms).

The problem is this bit of code:

        var mimeInfoService = Components
          .classes["@mozilla.org/uriloader/external-helper-app-service;1"]
          .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIMIMEService);
        var mimeInfo = mimeInfoService
          .getFromTypeAndExtension( "application/x-userscript+javascript", "user.js" );
        mimeInfo.preferredAction = mimeInfo.useHelperApp
        mimeInfo.preferredApplicationHandler = editor;
        mimeInfo.launchWithFile( aFile );

preferredApplicationHandler throws this error:

[Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIMIMEInfo.preferredApplicationHandler]"  nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://greasemonkey/content/utils.js :: openInEditor :: line 125"  data: no]

I'm working around this for now on Windows by using nsIProcess instead (which is actually easier), but that doesn't work for OSX because of it's complex application bundles.

Bug 307463?
Bug 307463 would fix my problem, but so would fixing this error in MIMEInfo. Either way.

Works for me on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008011305 Minefield/3.0b3pre
Still happens for me on FF3b2. I can't be bothered to test on FF3b3pre right now, but if Jesper says it works thats good enough for me. For now, working around with nsIProcess.
Sorry, I mixed up the versions. I was using trunk version of Greasemonkey. It uses nsIProcess. I don't know if the latest release works with FF3b.
Is nsIProcess the fix then? Or are you planning on doing something else?
In FF 3.0b5 Greasemonkey 0.7 "Ubuntu 8.04", I'm seeing the error launching the Editor.  The "New user scripts" does not appear to have any problem here.
Checking in again. 

Aaron, RC1 is out -- can we expect a 3.0.* version soon? 

Thanks for all your help!
Any updates on getting this ready for Firefox 3?

Aaron, to fix the MIMEInfo thing, you need to set preferredApplicationHandler to an nsIHandlerApp, not an nsIFile.  Looks like you want to create an nsILocalHandlerApp and set its .executable to the right thing.  Here's what the helper app dialog in Firefox does, for example:

1052         var localHandlerApp = 
1053           Components.classes["@mozilla.org/uriloader/local-handler-app;1"].
1054           createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalHandlerApp);
1055         localHandlerApp.executable = fp.file;

As Jesper pointed out, there's been a Greasemonkey 0.8 release candidate languishing for a while.  It appears that Aaron has disappeared, and he hasn't been able to upload it to AMO (or review it for that matter).
emailed greasemonkey-admins@googlegroups.com for an update...
It was 3.0.* yesterday, now back to beta 5. Any idea what happened?
Oh, I figured it out. There is a 0.8 version partially uploaded to AMO. Looks like the process has been started... but the upload was not finished or something. 
Whoops, that was me. I will fix.
Ok, this is live now.
You just made my day. Thank you so much!
Thanks Anthony, he did the majority of the work (also Jesper and Johan).
