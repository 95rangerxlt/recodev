Build ID: 20140428120048

Steps to reproduce:

Placed cursor over such as the stop/reload button in the Location Bar on Windows and Linux ...


Actual results:

On Windows, the cursor stays the default; on Linux, the cursor is changed to pointer ...


Expected results:

The cursor should be the same across platforms, given Australis goal of unifying the interface across platforms. This would also make things simpler for extension developers who may not be aware of these inconsistencies.

We should just show the same cursor for the search icon and the go/refresh/stop button as we do for other not-in-textbox buttons, on Linux. This seems to be fine already on Windows and Mac.
