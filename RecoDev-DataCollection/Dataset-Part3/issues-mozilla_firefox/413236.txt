I always can find a bug and complicate life :> .
As for not having the focus drawn, it was a nodoka bug introduced recently when
trying to fix another issue... I've fixed this just now.

As for having the bad focus in location bar, it seems you are passing wrong
parameter values to gtk_draw_shadow.

Then forget what I posted in comment #3. I thought it had something to do with setting the focus flag to a widget (setting that seemed to fix that issue).

The drop down button covers part of the location bar to hide the gap created by most themes to connect the text field with the button (the gap would become visible when the location bar background is yellow on secure sites). 

I already have a couple of ideas for how to fix this, but I still need to decide (and test) what would be the best solution.

As per comment #5, I'm updating the summary.

Move the negative margin hack to the autocomplete-security-wrapper element, to prevent the drop down button to cover (the gap) part of the text field (which causes the focus drawn outside the text field to also outline the button for a small part).

BTW, Dao, for clarity, does a review from you not suffice? You are not listed as an official reviewer AFAICT.

use -moz-margin-end, and please move /* keep the URL bar content LTR */ above or next to |direction: ltr;|, as it doesn't apply to the entire block anymore.

Ah, I see the way you use the margins is intentional, as -moz-margin-end will always be margin-right due to |direction: ltr|.
