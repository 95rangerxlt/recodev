We temporarily removed them for bug 279506 to see how things went.  I think it's
a change for the better, personally, because it means the doc loads quicker and
isn't disrupted so much by the screenshots.  Besides, there's this little
problem of having to update at least the download options screenshot, which is
used in the download manager doc now and is horribly out of date.

Note that per bug 279506 comment 27 we also need to remove |img { display: none;
}| because it wrongly affects the autoscroll icon because autoscroll sucks like
that.  Patch coming soon, as it shouldn't be a difficult fix...

Remove the images

I also removed a few other non-options window images which would have felt
out-of-place had we removed all the images but those.
