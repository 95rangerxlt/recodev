Panel Menu Item Checkmark @2x
(WIP up at http://people.mozilla.org/~bwinton/temp/bug979378.patch, building on Windows now.
I'll check the results tomorrow morning.)
*** Bug 978566 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 938603 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Sounds like bug 978566 and bug 938603 should be fixed by this, please check and reopen (or just fix here :) if not.
That's my understanding.

The main blocker on this (which I will push on tomorrow), is getting shorlander to decide what we want to do on each platform.  (For instance, if we follow system convention then on Windows *every* menu has space on the left for icons whether they have icons or not.  Is that what we want to do?  Maybeâ€¦  :)
So, here's the spec, straight from Stephen's mouth:

Things which can be checked should have a check everywhere.
None of this active-state-when-checked styling.

OS X: flush-left when not checked, lined up with icon-text when checked.
Windows/Linux: lined up with icon-text whether checked or not.
On Windows there is also an alignment problem with the disabled "Subscribe To This Page" item that doesn't have any icons. I don't know if it should also be aligned or a greyed out icon should be added.
A modification to the spec, again from Stephen.

Windows/Linux: always a gutter containing either an icon or a check.
OS X: always a gutter for just the check, then icon (potentially) beside, lined up with the labels.

Can this just use .subview-button[checked="true"] ?

Looks good on Windows and Linux. On OS X the checkmark's vertical alignment is off and the "View Bookmarks Sidebar" label isn't aligned in the Bookmarks Panel.

Checkmark Alignment

Forgot to mention that this breaks the checkmark on View Bookmarks Toolbar in the Bookmarks Toolbar submenu.

The hopefully final version of the patch.

Nits fixed, and ui updated.

This doesn't fix the bookmarks toolbar submenu checkmark, but I'ld like to do that in a followup patch, if possible.

Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Australis bookmarks panel
User impact if declined: checkmarks in australis bookmarks panel don't look right
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): on m-c for a while
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): like bug 972405, medium, but at this point moving forward is less risky than trying to keep all these fixes off Aurora
