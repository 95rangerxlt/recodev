Steps to reproduce:
1. Ensure "View|Status Bar" is not checked, so the Status Bar is hidden.
2. Open a web page
3. Select "File|Print Preview"
4. Press the "Close" button

Result:
The Status Bar isn't hidden anymore.

Expected Result:
The Status Bar should still be hidden.

This is a regression from bug 259005. Tested with Linux Gtk2 branch build 20041008.

Sorry, this is my fault. I know how to fix this, expect a patch tonight.

add check

This patch makes sure we check to see if the statusbar is already hidden and we
will not unhide it if it is. This follows the same approach as the findbar and
the sidebar.

also fix 257178

This is a slightly cleaned up patch and also fixes Bug 257178.
We should also disable the context menu on print previewed pages (try selecting
reload while in print preview to see what I mean). I have fooled around with
this and I can't seem to get the menu to stay disabled. If someone can show me a
good way to disable the context menu, I can add it to the attached patch and
hopefully get it into 1.0. This would fix just about every obvious non-theme
related UI quirk in print preview that I am aware of.

Perhaps bug 245024 and bug 245751 need to be merged into the aviary branch?
Thanks Stefan, I made a comment in the bug to see if the devs want it ported
over the branch. The patch looks like it should fix the problem I mentioned, but
I am not especially familar with the mozilla cpp code, so someone else will have
to make the call.
I think it is probably to late for this in 1.0
Chris, this is a low risk patch that fixes two bugs. If Ben is too busy, is
there anyone else I can ask for a quick review?

also fix 257178

Switching review request to Mike (he reviewed the previous patch). Although I
hope that this still might make aviary, the patch should apply to the trunk
fine.

port fix to trunk

I ported the fix to the trunk and can verify that it hides the statusbar and
browser messages (Bug 257178) properly in print preview.

Mike, would you mind reviewing this, or should I ask someone else?
Thanks a lot for the quick review.

Is this patch ready to land?
