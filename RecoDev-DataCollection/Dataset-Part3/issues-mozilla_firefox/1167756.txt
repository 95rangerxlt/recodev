We are leaking the AppConstants property in browser/components/pocket/main.js.
Only showed up in beta builds, wasn't seen in aurora or nightly. It wasn't seen in aurora because Pocket is disabled on aurora. It wasn't seen on release because the patch that introduced it didn't make it to release (bug 1164942). We aren't sure why it wasn't seen on nightly.

Let's get a retroactive beta approval here too for perpetuity. Note that it was already landed a=bustage anyway, though.
