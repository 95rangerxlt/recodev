Create a toolbar for filtering the types of logging that is displayed in the console. Also, we need a set of default prefs, as well as a storage mechanism for the prefs per HeadsUpDisplay. We can re-use the ConsoleStorage jsm for this as it tracks each Display anyway.

Might be cool to eventually keep track of uris/hosts/domains and tie a set of console filter prefs to them.
This is created and in the patch on bug 534398. Will open new bugs on any enhancements needed.
