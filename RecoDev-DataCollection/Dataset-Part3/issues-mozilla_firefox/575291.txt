I don't think it should, but if it is intended, it has to be done correctly.
If bug 575271 is fixed, it will at least look half-normal even if it doesn't work perfectly (since a lot of the menu items aren't related to the Print Preview window).
clarifying bug summary. (at first, I mistakenly thought this was about a button for creating new windows, which it's not -- I think it's about the new "Firefox button" on Windows platforms)
Correct, thanks.

FWIW, I doubt the menu there is intended -- in previous Firefox releases & in my current Linux trunk build, there aren't menus in print-preview.
(having said that, I'm not particularly familiar with the new Firefox button & how easy it would be to hide / disable in print-preview)
cc'ing Dao since he would be more familiar with this.

I would go farther to say that the print preview window doesn't really have any reason to take over the entire application.  It's like the largest modal dialog box that we've ever created!
Following the idea of #7, the print preview toolbar should only replace the urlbar when the tabs are on top, so that the preview remains within the logical space of the tab...

yeah, tab modal would be great.
Even so, can we fix the bug since the menu bar was not showing in a print preview before.

Not exactly related to this bug, but what prevents http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/7ea77e6340c4/browser/themes/winstripe/browser/browser.css#l184 from taking effect when the menu button is hidden due to e.g. the window being a popup?

It does take effect, doesn't it? But we hide the tab bar in popups.
