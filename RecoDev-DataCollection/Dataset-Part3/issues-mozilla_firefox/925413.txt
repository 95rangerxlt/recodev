According to the more recent reflow profiles for Snow Leopard posted in bug 902024, drawing the background of the nav-bar got 10x more expensive. What used to cost about 4ms across the entire TART suite costs something like ~40ms now.

Removing all backgrounds on the nav-bar showed a performance win on Snow Leopard:

So why? What got so expensive?

I'm curious to know whether bug 925514 has fixed this. I'll get some up-to-date reflow profiles and see what they say.
Here's an up-to-date comparison profile:

Now looking at the nav-bar background image measurement, we spend almost an equal amount of time drawing it as we do on m-c. \o/

So I think it's safe to say that bug 925514 took care of this. Closing this bug.
