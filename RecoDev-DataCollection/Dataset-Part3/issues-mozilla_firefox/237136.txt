There is no problem for the same reason as bug 237305.
However, if it changes a display / un-displaying, the display position of a
dialog screen will not become settled uniformly.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select "Add Bookmarks..."
2.The button which displays all bookmark folder lists(The button to which the
triangular icon was attached) is pushed.
3.Again, a button is pushed.

Actual Results: 
The display position of a dialog screen changes constantly.

Expected Results: 
The display position of a dialog screen is always fixed.

It is Checking by 2004-03-15 hightly build.

regression.
This is still a problem on Firefox 0.9.  Do any of the firefox developers have
access to a Mac?  This is quite an annoying bug.
I found the expandTree() function in addBookmarks2.js that shows/hides the
directory tree.  Unfortunately, the javascript debugger doesn't seem to work for
Firefox, so I can't debug it on the fly.  If someone can tell me what to look
for, I can take a look at this bug.
*** Bug 247724 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Please note that the Bug 247724 (which I filed because I never thought of
"changes position" as the magic words that had previously been used to describe
this behavior when querying bugzilla) includes comments regarding this
moving/jumping/position changing behavior not only for Add Bookmarks but also
Opening <filename> and Customize Toolbar, so debugging this issue probably
shouldn't be restricted to Add Bookmark.
its mac only, so should be blocking1.0mac

and yeah, this is a pretty obvious blocker
Why is there a separate blocking1.0 flag for mac?  Why not for the other
platforms, also?
Because Mac 1.0 is going to ship later than Win/Linux 1.0

We were zooming in, even when we weren't zoomed out (maximized).

This patch seems to fix all of the cases I know of, except for the Customize
Toolbar dialog (which has other major problems).
CCing Simon,

any progress with the review request?

Javier, can you please ask review from someone else, sfraser is on vacation

(maybe pinkerton?)
i don't follow this at all. first the description talks about a missing
interface. the patch, however, fixes zooming in when we weren't zoomed out.
also, it handle the reverse case (zooming out when we weren't zoomed in). why not?
I don't know about the error in the original description.  That may have been
unrelated.

As for not handling the other case: nsSizeMode_Minimized is handled at the top
of that function (returns NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED), so the only possible values are
nsSizeMode_Maximized and nsSizeMode_Normal.  I don't know if that function would
ever get nsSizeMode_Maximized when the window is already maximized;  but if it
did, I don't think it would do anything bad to maximize it again.  If you want,
I could just add some code to only maximize the window if the previous state was
nsSizeMode_Normal.
CCing Pinkerton, so he'll read your comment...
peterv, can you take a look at this when you get the chance?

Yeah, so this could be |if (NS_SUCCEEDED(rv) && aMode != previousMode)| and the
rest wouldn't need to change (I think). Either way, r=peterv.

If you do keep this, please make it |else if {|.
Simon, can you review?

No separate 1.0mac anymore, nominating for 1.0.

too late for 1.0
Checked in to trunk.
This bug needs to be reopened. I'm running Firefox 1.0.4 on Mac OS 10.4 and Add
Bookmark and Customize Toolbar are both jumping around the screen again.
(In reply to comment #26)
> This bug needs to be reopened.

Mitch, please read the 2 above comments. This didnt make it to 1.0.x, but will
be available in Firefox 1.1

sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
