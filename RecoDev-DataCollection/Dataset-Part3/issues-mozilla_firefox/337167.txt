Go to the page http://www.datashelf.us/TicTacToe.html

It has an image map of the 9 locations on the board with alt text for 
each.    If you load it up in IE, it shows 9 same page links.  In 
Firefox it only shows 7.  If you look at the browse mode buffers, you'll 
see that Firefox, for some reason, has merged two adjacent area maps in 
2 places.

Mark, do you mean http://www.datashelf.us/ticTacToe.htm ? That URL is 404.
Pretty sure the URL I gave is correct.
Bill, is this fixed now?
