Adblock crashes Firefox when using its "overlay flash" function (Tools > Adblock
> Overlay Flash (for left-click) ). Happens on all the sites, regardless they
actually contain any flash to overlay.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go Tools > Adblock > Overlay Flash (for left-click)



Actual Results:  
Crash.

Expected Results:  
Adblock overlays all flash objects in the page with a clickable box or does
nothing when page doesn't contain flash.

Using clean profile.
Adblock 0.5.2.039 (hacked trunk version from
http://www.projects1.com/firefox/exthacks/FFnightlyextensions.html also crashes).

Confirmed using U.M.O version of Adblock.

-> Possible fallout from bug 281988 ?
I may be getting a bit too far ahead here: but do you have a test case?

See 
Bug 281657 "Crash with this testcase (derived from Adblock+Flashblock crash case) 
[@ nsBlockFrame::PullFrameFrom]"
Saw the first crash in the nightly of 21-May: ID:2005052122.

Tools > Adblock > Overlay Flash (for left-click) on this page crashes 

bug 281657 appears to a different issue to this bug as this is a recent regression
talkback
http://talkback-public.mozilla.org/talkback/fastfind.jsp?search=2&type=iid&id=TB6060115E
Bug 295195 (Spellbound extension) appears to be a simular (if not the same) issue?
Probably the same as bug 295101
Fixed by patch in bug 295101.
