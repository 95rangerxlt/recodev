This is performed by the installer code as a post update action so changing component.
This should probably block final
I thought we *always* did this? I mean, I'm happy to have it change, and rarely like to override Rob Strong, sooo ... blocking final+!
This is for the Windows 7 jumplists that jimm implemented... for an unknown reason the jumplists in the start menu aren't being updated.

From the description, it sounded like a shortcut naming problem?
That would be it!

We are going to rename the shortcuts for all beta builds to Firefox Beta per a newsgroup discussion so we don't have to one-off the installer code to handle betas differently.
also, fyi, beta 1 is installed in:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox 4.0 Beta 1\firefox.exe"

upgrading to beta 6 keeps the beta 1 install location.
Right... per the newsgroup discussion both the shortcuts and the install location will both be named "Mozilla Firefox x.x Beta"

One thing I have personally experienced with the jumplists is that pinning a start menu shortcut to the start menu didn't have the same data (very minimal data to be exact) as when pinning the quicklaunch shortcut to the start menu. That is what I am concerned with in this bug and *think* that is also what the reporter was stating in comment #1 though I may be misinterpreting.

That would imply the start menu shortcut had the wrong AppUserModelID applied. I've not seen that locally but if you run into it please try and find an STR. FWIW I just pinned my nightly build start menu shortcut to the start menu and it has the right jump list. So it seems to be working in general, although something might be broken with the betas. I'll do some more testing to see.
It isn't working for me right now. This is with a default install from two days ago and each days it has been updated with a nightly update.

The shortcut I pinned
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Minefield\Minefield.lnk

The pinned shortcut
C:\Users\rstrong\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\StartMenu\Minefield.lnk

Both point to
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Minefield\firefox.exe"

I have 5 items under frequent that are to say the least not frequent and only Enter private browsing under tasks. I have unpinned it and repinned it using the Start Menu shortcut and it still exhibits the same behavior. When I take my Quick Launch shortcut and pin it to the Start Menu everything shows up.
Hmm so last night a dragged the shortcut from the startmenu to the taskbar and it didn't group. It had the app id it was ggiven on the initial install. This morning after an update, the taskbar shortcut merged with the running instance.

So we seem to be updating the taskbar shortcuts on an update. What we aren't doing is updating the actual shortcut files created in the start menu.

I can add some code to do that.
