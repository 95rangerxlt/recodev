Bug 1203494 made the URL bar dropmarker only appear when the location bar is hovered, but that requires high precision and some specific directional movement of the mouse to trigger it with high possibility of stopping the mouse where the dropmarker will appear.

Also, as a user who frequently uses the dropmarker, I find that it disappears too quickly if I accidentally overshoot the location bar and the mouse stops on the tabstrip above the navigation toolbar.

Patch

This patch is an improvement over what we currently are doing, but the #navigator-toolbox doesn't get :hover when hovering over the #TabsToolbar in an area that is absent of tabs (at least on Windows). I don't know what we can do about that, but if we can't do anything about that at least this patch makes it incrementally better.

I don't understand why you changed the logic here rather than just updating the selector.

Patch v2

Sorry, I had initially approached the patch by writing selectors for each toolbar and inverted the logic until I realized I wouldn't be able to write a selector for the #PersonalToolbar which is after the #navbar. When I switched it to using the #navigator-toolbox I didn't think about reverting the logic to the pre-patch approach.

".urlbar-textbox-container > " is redundant now that you're not using the child selector all the way.
