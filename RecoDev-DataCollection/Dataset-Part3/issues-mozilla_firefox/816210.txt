This is a pretty minor optimization, but nevertheless..

STR:

1. Open debugger on http://htmlpad.org/debugger/
2. Type ! in the filter box
At this point, all the sources text contents are fetched and cached in preparation for the search operation. In this case, only jquery.min is fetched, since debugger.html is already loaded.
3. Delete the ! from the filter box. Manually select jquery from the menulist.
The jquery.min source is fetched again. This is redundant, since we have already cached the source.

It will let the debuggee avoid doing the work again, which may be important in underpowered devices, so definitely yes!
