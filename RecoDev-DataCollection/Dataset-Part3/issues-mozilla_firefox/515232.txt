currently the localized searchengines feature for "distribution/searchplugins" is broken for builds that use a complex pref for general.useragent.locale - which is what we don in ubuntu

Also its not possible to overload searchplugins in the "common" directory in the locale folder, which could be fixed by changing the order of the searchplugindirs returned in browser/components/dirprovider/nsBrowserDirectoryProvider.cpp ... which I would like to address in the same patch.

Try getting general.useragent.locale as a complex value first in DirectoryProvider.cpp

Only the first paragraph of comment 0 still applies. Instead of using Alex's approach of using chrome registry, I'm just using GetComplexValue, fallbacking to GetChar if that fails, which is what all other code paths getting general.user-agent.locale are using.

It might be nice to make this use mozilla::Preferences while we're changing this.

Unfortunately, mozilla::Preferences is an internal API, and as such is not available from browser.
