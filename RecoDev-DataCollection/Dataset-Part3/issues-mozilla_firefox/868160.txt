Please file an issue and send a PR upstream.
Also, the file is reused for the Web viewer which supports other browsers than Firefox.
That said, we can remove some cargo-cult prefixes. For example, IE and Opera support CSS transitions without prefix from the start.

WIP, will be ready by tomorrow, or day after.

For that reason, my solution (proposed over IRC chat) was to have a mozilla-central branch upstream which is optimized for integration with Firefox releases without unnecessary cross-browser codes (i.e. can have Firefox/Gecko/mozJS specific optimizations to it. Required changes from master can be cherry-picked, if/as required.

Should I send a separate pull request for that (if the above scheme sounds okay)?

I'm not sure it's the optimal solution, especially when PDF.js is actively updated due to many rendering bugs. Perhaps we can extend builder.js to remove unneeded prefixes from the generated file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed on IRC, this needs to happen upstream in the pdf.js project using the build script to strip these out of here or some other similar way.
Partial fix: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/3587
Not likely that -webkit prefixes will have to be removed anytime soon.
Others are taken care of. It's good to close this bug, IMO.
The webkit ones are stripped out by our build script.
