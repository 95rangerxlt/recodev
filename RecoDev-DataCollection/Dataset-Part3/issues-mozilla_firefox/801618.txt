Yoric, the other asyncCopy functions are being used to copy PNG images. Is it better to use asyncCopy in those cases?

You should remove this trailing whitespace.

If you remove the aCallback argument (that isn't used by any caller), I think you can simply do something like this:
> let data = new TextEncoder().encode(aData);
> OS.File.writeAtomic(aFile.path, data, { tmpPath: aFile.path + ".tmp" });

Oh, sorry, it was there and you removed it :)

Hey Berker, my comments were only suggestions, you should ask Yoric to review your code :)

Ah, okay. The whitespace change still out of scope for the bug, thanks for the noticing :)

Agreed with marco.

This is good, but I agree with marco's remark that we can take the opportunity to remove the callback from this function and its callers.

In case we ever need the feature some day, just return the promise.

Please:
- remove argument |aCallback|;
- remove the third argument from all the call sites of |writeToFile|;
- return the result of |writeAtomic|.

Thanks for the review, Yoric.

I've rebased the patch and ran the tests in dom/tests/mochitest/webapps/. Is the location correct?

I don't have a level 1 hg account to push the try server. Can you help me with this?
I think that the correct tests are actually on webapprt/test.

Pushed to Try, though: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=288ffadc2d84

Thanks! Looks like these failures are not related with the patch. Should I add the "checkin-needed" keyword?
Looks good to me. You will need to add ";r=yoric" at the end of your commit message.

Taking a look at WebApps.jsm and WebappsIconHelpers.js, it seems that the remaining calls of asyncCopy are used to copy an icon that has already been downloaded to /tmp. In that case, just use OS.File.copy, which is much more efficient than asyncCopy.

We're actually also converting the images, so I think asyncCopy should be necessary.
