Note: the second failure in this log has "false == true" instead of "2 == 3".  The first failure matches the one in comment 0, though.
Daniel, i don't understand your report, the failure you reported is in test_browserGlue_prefs.js while this bug is about test_browserGlue_smartBookmarks.js

you should have filed a separate report since the issue looks different.
Oops! Good catch -- sorry about that.  My brain must've only been doing prefix-matching on the test names, or something. I've now filed bug Bug 522735 for the log in comment 4.

I don't suppose this test could be made any more verbose about where it's failing, in the error message itself, or could maybe be broken into multiple separate tests?

I was just about to claim that http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox-Unittest/1258065623.1258068454.9885.gz was this when I noticed the 4 == 3, and eventually realized that this bug is about a failure in "All smart bookmarks are created if smart bookmarks version is 0" and that at least once I've wrongly claimed that a failure in "An explicitly removed smart bookmark should not be recreated" was this, and was about to claim that a failure in "An existing smart bookmark is replaced when version changes" was as well.
And just to prove it's not just me, while I was typing that it got starred as being this bug :)
it's interesting that this still fails, it should not.
but probably all failures have a common cause and it's ok to annotate all failures for this bug here.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.

Looking at these test failures, the only thing that makes sense to me is a sync issue, although I'm not even sure of that.  I've pushed a change that disables sync for this test:

(this is with the commit two comments back, so it looks like it didn't help)
Well, now it's failing at line 147 instead of line 149.  I'm going to disable this test because it's been failing frequently.  Marco and I will take a hard look at this test again this week.

i did already know this was not fixed by disabling sync component, we already did that, this test does not have anything strange that calls for a fix, and i was never able to reproduce the issue locally, it fails only on tinderboxes, exactly like the random failure in test_browserGlue_distribution and test_browserGlue_prefs.
this test exists from March but it started failing only on August, without apparent reasons, or maybe something landed during that month that we did not notice.
I think there could be something bad in importExportService that is used by all tests, looks like sometimes bookmarks service fails in it, i've suggested a first cleanup (with more error logging) in bug 420729.
it could be unrelated, btw we upgraded to sqlite 3.6.16 just some day before first failures, i can't find other interesting changes in the first days of August atm
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1262958311.1262963890.31824.gz

i've enabled the test to get more logging out of it, i'll disable it again once i get enough data.
i added various checks and dumps to try figure out what's up:

i disabled the test on Windows for now, other platforms will be enough to ensure the functionality.
The console logging (comment 59) has not brought any interesting result.
I'll try to setup a record and replay env, hoping to be able to reproduce the failure.

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/27c48ab51c3a
But note that (from comment #51) this bug may also happen on other platforms than Windows.
(In reply to comment #64)
> But note that (from comment #51) this bug may also happen on other platforms
> than Windows.

it is possible (the test changed a bit from then and also we fixed some query that could have been related to that specific failure). The shouting case was still Windows (practically perma orange), i would survive a failure a week to avoid completely losing testing a code path. So let's see how this performs right now.

the latest failures here are due to est_browserGlue_distribution.js | test failed (with xpcshell return code: -6)

since the test exits badly, sounds like we don't run registered cleanup functions...
distribution test has been disabled for now, till we figure it out.
are you saying that this is solely caused by distribution.ini being imported? if so, should this be resolved?
no, it has 2 causes, one is distribution.ini, the other one is unknown, even if actually we could try re-enable it and see what happens. Fixing tests without being able to reproduce failures is hard :(
