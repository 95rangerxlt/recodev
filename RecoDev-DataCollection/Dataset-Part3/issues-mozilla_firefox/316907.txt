I use Firefox heavily for about 2 hours every morning. During that 2 hours I have to reprogram Firefox every 15 minutes or so. Pictures off, include cookies in clean private data every 15 minutes or so.  It resets to default, reporgrams my start page, turn pictures on, and asks me to confrm closing all 24 tabs.  

I would like to trust Firefox to delete temp,cookies and history ever time Firefox closes, but I can't - I have to set it to confirm clear private data 
each time I close Firefox.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a program and click 24 links (50 times) fast
2.continue loop until new load shows pictures
3.reset options when Firefox resets to default.    

Actual Results:  
All my settings dissapear 

Expected Results:  
should remember my settings.

My boot is set to selective startup with load system services checked. Use modified boot.ini  but I don't think this matters becasue it does the same thing on the other computer that loads normally.

Are you sure the folder Mozilla in Application Data is not read-only?
Type %appdata% in your Run box to see that folder. It will contain a lot of nearly identical files in that case.

Mozilla properties: read only
contains 65 files, 6 folders.
Do you see something like prefs-2.js prefs-3.js prefs-4.js ?
If you rightclick on the Mozilla folder > Properties there is an option Read-only. Uncheck it and confirm.
If this is not the problem, you could try a new profile. With Firefox closed, rename the profile folder Mozilla and start Firefox again.

This seems to have made a difference. I have completed my morning job and I did so without it defaulting on me.  Before the change it was defaulting every 15 mintes or so.  I will know for sure tomorrow morning when I do all 50 over again. Thank you very much.
