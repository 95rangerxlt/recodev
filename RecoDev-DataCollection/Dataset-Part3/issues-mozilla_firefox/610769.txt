Planned alignment at 8x

Slight alignment change for the Firefox menu: goal is to have it left aligned with the dark edge of the button, and flush with the bottom.

Not sure if these are the desired margins or not. It just moves the menu 1px to the right and 1px up.

screenshot with patch

And what it looks like, zoomed in 800%. (Applied via Stylish against beta7, if that matters. Didn't feel like building from trunk with the change, and 7-zip still won't let me in to omni.jar to make the change manually...)

screenshot v2

Oops, apparently I just zoomed in 800%, and didn't enlarge the picture itself...

Let's try this again?

Use margin-top and -moz-margin-start instead of the margin shorthand.

Also test this with Classic -- the margin should only be needed with Aero.

v2 to avoid the shorthand

Changes CSS to remove shorthand

You sure? Looks like there was a 1px gap between the menu and the button (and a 1px offset from the left edge) on the Win7 Classic theme without this patch applying to it as well. I don't have a copy of XP handy to see how it looks.


Do any of the other OS themes have the app button accessible?

That's not what I see and not what browser-aero.css says. It adds the white outer border (which your compensating here) only for -moz-windows-default-theme.

Now in browser-aero.css.

Yes, this should do it, thanks.

nit: add another space before -moz-margin-start

Adds the space.
