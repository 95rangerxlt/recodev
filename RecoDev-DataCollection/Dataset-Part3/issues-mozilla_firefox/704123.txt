patch v1

I'm not sure that a noise pattern is a wise design choice for a page inspection tool... The veil needs to be distinguishable from the highlighted area, of course, but why go further than that?

r- since tabprompts-bgtexture.png is for tab-modal prompts and may arbitrarily change in the future. It's not supposed to be used in random other places.
