If you'd like to keep the hunks that remove [pinned], please rebase on top of bug 1192568.

Why are you removing the [pinned] attributes here?  I don't understand why these changes are needed in this patch.

r=me on a rebased version on top of bug 1192568.

Note that I am landing bug 1192568 on inbound today when it reopens, and landing this patch unmodified (especially on fx-team) will create merge issues for the sheriffs.

Please use fx-team for front-end related changes. The point of separating the branches by functional area is to avoid such merge issues.

Will this be also uplifted to 42, so that full themes won't have to include these "display:" rules for compatibility with FF?
