Although the netError page itself is themeable, its shortcut icon is not. Thus if a theme author changes the image in netError.css for consistency with his theme, the icon beside the error message will be different from the page icon displayed in the location bar. I think that the <link rel="icon"> part in netError.xhtml should point to an icon file in the skin instead of some hardcoded data image.

This bug is part of a query for Firefox bugs that have Status set to NEW, but have version field set to 2.0 or older and have not changed in over 800 days.

If you still see this bug, or if it is still valid with Firefox 3.6.10 or a firefox 4 nightly build, please update the version field and steps to reproduce.
The icon is now themeable as it refers to a chrome://global/skin:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/resources/content/netError.xhtml
66     <link rel="icon" type="image/png" id="favicon" href="chrome://global/skin/icons/warning-16.png"/>

This can be 'blamed' to:
Bug 429721: Update 16x16 warning favicon in netError.xhtml to be platform specific, patch by Ehsan Akhgari <ehsan.akhgari@gmail.com>, r+sr=jst, a=beltzner 

Thanks for fixing this!
