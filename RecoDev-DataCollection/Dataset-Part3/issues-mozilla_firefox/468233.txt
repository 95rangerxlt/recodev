When doing the review for the bug 382187 port of the history part of places to SeaMonkey, Neil spotted the misspelling "hideifnoinsetionpoint" (missing "r" in "insertion") in the comment in controller.js, but actually this attribute is misspelled all over, see http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=hideifnoinsetionpoint

This should probably be corrected to avoid confusion.

yeah, we know about that, was also notified during the review process but still went in... Will most likely be corrected when working on that code (i also think i have a lying around patch in bugzilla that was fixing it too, but can't find actually)

thanks for notifying issues you find while adapting that code.
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=Dragable is another misspelling in places code, BTW.

Had nothing to do so I made this patch.

This fixes:
"hideifnoinsetionpoint" -> "hideifnoinsertionpoint"
"Dragable" -> "Draggable" (it should be written like that, isn't it?)

no risk, asking approval just to sync code and avoid unbitrotting.

Sadly, I don't think this can be taken on branch because it changes method names that add-ons might be taking.
http://mxr-test.konigsberg.mozilla.org/addons/search?string=getDragableSelection

shows that AMO addons with IDs 6759, 6545, 424, 3615, 6271 call that method. It would be nice to give them a heads up to let them know they might need to update their addons for trunk compatibility.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
