Multiline text selection works just fine, but single line text selection leads to unselecting of text and focusing of input box.

This is a regression due to bug 960695

You might want to keep the e.target.nodeName checks.

added a test. All console tests pass locally.

Tweaked _addMessageLinkCallback a little to clear out previous _startX, _startY entries. Moved callback handlers to arrow functions.

Needed one executeSoon for the final selection test.

nit: this test is growing. Task.spawn() would help a lot with keeping it cleaner / less convoluted.

(no need to change the test now - just for reference, for future tests)

Please call finishTest() in the executeSoon() function. ok() can become undefined if finish() is called too early.
this thing just breaks the network popups. Going to have to revert...

ended up copying the addMessageLinkCallback. The preventDefault() was preventing popups from being triggered over anchors. Should be fixed now, but the unittest is still failing on the drag test. Need to debug it.

sorry. Updating this with a better-working patch. The unittest has the drag test disabled (via todo) for now because it's just not working. Tips welcome.
This is failing locally for some reason with this patch:
