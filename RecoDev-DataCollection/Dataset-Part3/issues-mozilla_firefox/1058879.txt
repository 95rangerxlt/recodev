0002-Bug-1058879-enable-most-canvasdebugger-tests-in-e10s.patch

This patch is very similar to the one in bug 1072141 etc.  A key difference here is that there is a single test that relies on the "debuggee" - so this patch just disables that single test in e10s (and thus, I'll keep the "leave-open" annotation to track that one final test)

Nice.
I believe this is the last patch needed for this tool to be enabled in e10s.

Presumably you want to remove leave-open too?
