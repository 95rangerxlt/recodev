There are an awful lot of left overs in toolkit which put work load on localizers
without being used anywhere.

Look at the links at the wiki, prominent examples are wallet urls, svg.properties,
getNewThemesURL (that's xpfe only), the 1.0.x defines for app.update.url, and
maybe more, I'm still investigating.

I filed bug 328988 on removal of builtinURLs.rdf, as that involves more work than
just removal of dead wood.

remove dead code

This patch removes:

 svg.properties (dead, according to tor)

 wallet.foo from intl.properties, those entities aren't used in wallet
  (the mail navigator.properties was already removed)

 getNewThemesURL and content.version from region.dtd (xpfe only)
 releaseURL from region.dtd, unused

 getNewThemesURL and smartBrowsingURL from region.properties (xpfe only)

 update.properties copy from update, this one is in extensions now (which
  doesn't need app.update.url anymore), the one in update ain't even built.

These removals have been backed up by lxr searches on the 1.8 branch.
I need a real review from Ben to make sure these are really dead.
I have approval from KaiRo to chop out the xpfe-only things, whatever they
would want to add back for seamonkey-on-toolkit will go in their application
locale.

The remaining URLs in the code still need to be consolidated, too.

Landed on both trunk and 1.8 branch. This turned locales orangeon both those 
branches.
