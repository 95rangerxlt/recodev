I am attaching a video for the logged issue - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8682365 .
Mihai, by "detailed" do you mean that it gets expanded?
Yes, that's what I meant.
Is suspect this is the same underlying issue as bug 1219076, but since they are somewhat different STR, we should fix one and then not close the other bug until we've verified that it is also fixed.
