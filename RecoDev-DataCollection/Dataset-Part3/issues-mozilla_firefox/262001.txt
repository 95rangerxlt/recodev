Firefox 1.0PR, macosx 10.3++ [insert code name here]

I downloaded firefox and tried it on a developer version
of MacOSX, things ran ok.  I did notice that dragging the
app to the doc didn't seem to create an app icon, this
works fine for 10.3.5/Panther, instead I just see the default
pencil/ruler icon.
