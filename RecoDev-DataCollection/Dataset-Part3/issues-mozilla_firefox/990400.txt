A merge conflict happened in main.js when bug 962577 landed with a use of `Promise` after bug 986481 had removed every occurence of it. This problem lead to a race condition, that was wrongly fixed in bug 988931 by importing `promise.js` again.

Instead, main.js should use the preferred `Promise.jsm`.

... and export promise symbol with a lowercase.

Actually I'm wrong, thanks to bug 986481, all devtools modules automagically have `promise` symbol in their global scope. So there is nothing to export. Just do a %s/Promise/promise/g

Actually main.js has a `defer` function in the global scope that seems to do just what I want.
That defer is coming from line 62 of main.js, which also imports addon-sdk promises, so this probably isn't the solution you want if the goal is to use Promise.jsm.

I only had 5mn for this patch, and saw where `defer` came from just after uploading, so I told Alex to r-. Will come back to this bug in a short while.
This was fixed by bug 995184.
