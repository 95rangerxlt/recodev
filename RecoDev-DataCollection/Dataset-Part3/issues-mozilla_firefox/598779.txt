I think this should block final but getting it for beta 7 is a bit risky.
We will also need to add a keyboard modifier that, when held, causes Firefox to start in Safe Mode. This functionality already exists on OSX.
Just to confirm, we're not getting rid of the -safe-mode command-line flag right?

Most definitely not, but I don't really consider that a user-friendly way of invoking the mode.
When Firefox is the default browser, the pinned icon in the start menu (in Vista at least) when right-clicked provides the option of starting in safe mode.

Filed bug 602562 to add this

That functionality is not present in Windows 7

That should be handled over here in bug 519985 where its already been discussed to include on jumplist.
If Firefox is not set as the default it won't be available on Vista and below. I agree it should be added to the jumplist in bug but the point is that adding it to the jumplist won't meet all of the requirements as stated. Let's keep this bug about removing the shortcuts after the requirements have been met.

patch rev1

Looks good. Are the added ShellLink::SetShortCutWorkingDirectory call required to make this work?
BTW, great idea, the start menu folder is annoying.

Only when $OUTDIR isn't the installation directory... I added those "just in case" and for consistency.

Is this suppose to remove it when we update from a nightly?
On update, if the start menu directory exists and contains a shortcut (based on the shortcut_log.ini) that points to the install location it creates the new shortcut in the root of the start menu, removes the shortcuts from the directory and if the directory is empty (which it should be) removes the directory.

On install, if the start menu directory exists and contains a shortcut (based on the shortcut_log.ini) that points to the install location it removes the shortcuts from the directory and if the directory is empty (which it should be) removes the directory. It by default will create the shortcut in the root of the start menu unless the choice to create the start menu shortcut is unchecked.
cc'ing some SeaMonkey and Thunderbird people in case they would like to do this as well.

This part isn't working... filed Bug 627848
*** Bug 566519 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
We'll just rely on bug reports for regressions instead of a litmus test
