happens in both cairo and non-cairo builds
Most likely a regression from bug 328496.
More likely to be a regression from bug 326712 ;)

remove old content when replacing matches

Turns out that the search service is modifying the RDF while the template is initially being built. This causes the modification notifications to update the template, then the initial build continues adding the same data again. Fix this by removing the old content when replacing a match similar to bug 327504.

Why is the search service adding all the engines, removing them all again, and then readding them? For sorting?
