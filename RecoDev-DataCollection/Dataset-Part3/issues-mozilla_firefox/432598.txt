Don't show EULA for debug builds

Since when you're doing browser development you're more likely to be using fresh profiles, the EULA dialog just adds an annoyance. Patch attached bypasses this for debug builds.

The EULA is already turned off for Windows and Mac, even though when you've self built you haven't used an installer, so this doesn't actually introduce any new policy imho.

I'd just add:

#ifdef DEBUG
pref("browser.EULA.override", true);
#endif

to avoid having to change the pref every time we update the EULA version. Otherwise this is probably OK.
