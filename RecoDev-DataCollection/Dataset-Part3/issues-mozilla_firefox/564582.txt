This problems is confined to Linux. I just took Firefox on Win7 for a spin to check and it works like a charm (ie. like expected - font-family does have the desired effects).

Perhaps an issue in the interface layer between the rendering engine and the OS (gfx/thebes/src ? just speculating!)?
Bug can be closed. Incorrect font setting interpreted the wrong way - ie. specified font couldn't be displayed but I thought it was a FF issue.
