STR:

1. Open the Web Console.
2. Type "inspect()" without quotes.
3. Press Left once and type "document.". Try Tab.

By now I would expect I get completion suggestions for document. If I press Delete once, I do.

Proposed fix: simply take into consideration for completion what is up to the cursor location. That way we can get more helpful completion when we write more complicated code.

The point of this work is to allow non-linear writing of code. Most often I do not write code linearly. Sometimes I jump a line back (during multiline input editing), or I jump at the start of the line to add a call, a variable, etc.

I am also of the habit of typing opening and closing parenthesis then move back one char to type the arguments: eg. I write linearly document.body.appendChild(), then move in (), then type foobarVar, then press enter.

Showing completion suggestions would ease typing in most cases. I also believe that non-linear writing of code is quite often among developers.

Please play with the patch. I would really like this kind of autocomplete. Also compare with chrome.

If you are undecided, maybe we can ask others from the team to also play with the patch.

Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Thanks!

yeah, this looks reasonable, I think.

Thanks for testing and for the f+!

This is the same as the wip, but with added toolkit and browser tests. Offsets were incorrect in the toolkit tests for autocomplete, otherwise these changes do not cause any existing tests to break.

kind of amazing we didn't do this before.
Thanks for the review!
