-----------------------------------------------------------------

I see a bunch of complexity that could be avoided by tweaking the webapps actor.
Like exposing a running and (optionally) icon attribute on getAll result.
So far, noone is using these new webapps actor method, so we should feel free to modify those
and avoid unecessary workaround.

Having said that, I'm fine simplifying with iterations.

Is this new line expected?

nit: "destroyed" -> ConnectionsManager.DESTROYED

Wouldn't it be worth unregistering these listeners on WebappsStore destroy?
Or is it only called on connection destroy that will most likely free listeners.

I'm wondering if we end up using the `running` list at the end, in UI code?
Isn't `running` boolean on each app object enough?

We need the list.

We can improve the actor later.
