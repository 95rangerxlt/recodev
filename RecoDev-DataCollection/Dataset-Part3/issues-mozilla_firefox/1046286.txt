We are getting a lot of feedback from users that feel they are forced to use Google as the search provider on the New Tab page. The fact that you can switch providers is not obvious to them.

We are working on some educational pushes from our end. Making the switcher more obvious in the product would be a great help as well.

Do they also feel the same thing in terms of about:home?  It's effectively the same default look & feel as what we've been shipping for three years.  I don't think this is a huge priority.
We do get feedback about that field, but since this is a new feature users are obviously noticing it more than something that's been in the product, possibly longer than they have been using it. This is more about making the entire switcher more obvious in general, which will alleviate a whole category of feedback that this new tab field has only highlighted.
about:home doesn't currently have a picker, bug 1029889 is about having it use the same one as about:newtab consolidating them.

Bug 1040267 is proposing some changes to its styling which might also be relevant here.
Turning this into a UX bug since bug 1040267 is focusing on the dropdown itself and not on the discoverability.

Add drop-down arrow next to search provider logo

I think this might be as simple as adding a drop-down arrow next to the search provider logo.

Add drop-down arrow next to search provider logo

That works and it's consistent with what we have in the search bar.
I assume that the hover effect would also wrap around the arrow.
