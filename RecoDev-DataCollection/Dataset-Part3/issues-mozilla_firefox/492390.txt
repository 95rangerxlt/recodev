Is this credits in about:credits or credits in About Firefox > Credits ?
Lord help us all, but we do make this complicated, don't we?  :)  I meant credits.xhtml,

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/credits.xhtml

which gets included in the About Firefox->Credits box. That's the one in-product, managed by mconnor.

about:credits is actually just a redirect to http://www.mozilla.org/credits/, which is maintained by Gerv. He prefers to handle these via email to credits@mozilla.org, but I'll cc him here in case it helps him spot people he might have missed (even though the lists are not semantically equivalent).

In the case of Rob, he should be on both lists.

Okay, I would ask that people email me nominations, as this isn't something I'm comfortable handling with public nominations.  Thanks.
We on track to get an update committed today?
Connor, happy to work on this for you if you send me the list ...
The problem is that I think the list is incredibly short and missing names, the patch itself is trivial...

first rev

Dahlt -> Dahl
Pointed out, fixed.  This landed branch/trunk already.
yay
Does "first rev" mean that there's more to come? If so, should this be reopened?
Connor indicated (out of band) that he'd be done in a few hours, many many hours ago, so I'm presuming that whatever needed to land has landed.
No, I got pulled into blocker reviews, but I've got the data for a bunch more contributors.  We shouldn't block on this, but I'll get it together ASAP anyway.

"more" still needs to land, right?

Aakash & Tomomi added, excess space removed, didn't add Gen's other suggestion as this is Firefox contributors only atm.

If it's not too late, can we also add:
  Keith Schwarz
(He's an intern from last summer who implemented -moz-transform, one of the awesome new CSS features in Firefox 3.5)
Well, we're not holding the RC for this, so whatever gets in by the time we lock down, gets in.

r+ for the additions, I made a decision when we started this that we weren't getting into culling the list this cycle, because that's a process that we should either apply across the board or not at all.

That should be "Rick Reitmaier".
I look forward to the change in comment 34 making it along with the rest of this patch on to trunk. This bug is entirely, all-the-way closed for firefox1.9.1. If anyone checks in additional fixes there, they should be prepared to justify why they've done so.

I checked in a fix for the typo on the 1.9.1 relbranch and tip, and on trunk, so that it will be included *if* we spin rc3build2. I didn't make any additional changes.
Gavin: so is this fixed on trunk, then?
Yeah, I guess so.

He is still in the list. Further I miss Heather Arthur.
