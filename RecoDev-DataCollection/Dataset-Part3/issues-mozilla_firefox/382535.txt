I have the same problem.

I have noticed that the download dialog box opens in case the                                script has 30 second delay in responding.

I am using Firefox 2.0.0.4 on Kubuntu 7.04

Add first, Extension Compatibility is *imho* the wrong Component.
Second, without a testcase or URL this is hard to test.
Third, do you mean displaying the page with "interpreat the code of the php"?

@SourceV
Have you a testcase or a URL?


I look to this Bug in the following weeks and marks as Invalid if nothing happens to reduce unconfirmed inactive Bugs.
