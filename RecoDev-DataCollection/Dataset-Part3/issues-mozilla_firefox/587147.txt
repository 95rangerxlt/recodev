fix + test code

This patch fixes the bug and provides automated test code for the group view expand/collapse functionality.

A note on the fix:

The styleGroup views were only created once, when the CssHtmlTree object was constructed. However, the #groups element is cleared each time the user highlights a new element in the page (see the _populateMainTemplates() method which invokes the _template() method, that clears the destination element each time - in this case #groups). This resulted in having stale DOM elements that were no longer displayed, because they were not re-added.

My fix is minimal in its intent: I simply moved the createStyleGroupView() method call in the highlight() method - no code re-org, no major changes. A more elaborate fix would be to improve the code to no longer need a whole UI rebuild each time the user highlights a new element in the web page. This could be done nicely - we could only rebuild the properties view within each styleGroupView, when they already exist.

If you want the more elaborate approach, please let me know and I'll update the patch.
Let's stick with the simple fix. Joe is not around to provide feedback now.

fix + test code

I think this looks reasonable. I am a fan of the test code!
I have merged this fix into the main patches from bug 582596.
