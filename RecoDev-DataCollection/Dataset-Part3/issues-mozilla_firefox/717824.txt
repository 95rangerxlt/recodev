Bug 696436 added a configure flag that allows us to add a prefix to the Mac bundle filename produced by the build system. This flag was meant to be used to have MoCo-produced Nightly and Aurora builds be FirefoxNightly.app and FirefoxAurora.app, respectively. I did this initially by landing the relevant changes to the in-tree mozconfigs, which works well enough, but there's one downside: the "nightly" mozconfig is also used for nightly builds from the mozilla-beta and mozilla-release repos, which results in odd bundle names for those builds (eg. FirefoxFirefoxDebug or FirefoxFirefox).

This isn't disastrous, since those builds don't get shipped to anyone, but it confuses people who download them manually to test (e.g. in bug 659552).

To avoid this problem, it would be nice if we used the mechanism Armen created in bug 712115 to specify this flag in the releng configs, rather than the in-tree mozconfigs. We really do want them only to be used for MoCo-produced builds, and only for certain branches.

config.py changes

I tried to take a stab in the dark at what these changes might look like, based on the patches in bug 712115. I have no idea if this is correct/sufficient, and it's certainly not tested :)

buildbotcustom changes
I'm -0 on this approach, since it adds yet another special flag in that code and opens the door for lots of other per-branch customization in buildbot-configs which we're actively trying to get away from.

Is this possible to do in the mozconfig?

if [ "${MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL}" = "nightly" ]; then
ac_add_options --with-macbundle-prefix
fi

or 

test -f mozconfig-${MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL} && . mozconfig-${MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL}

Yeah, I suppose that could work.

(I suggested the config-hackery only because this is a little different than most build-config changes; we really do only want this to apply to MoCo build infra, since it involves use of the Firefox trademark that would be unauthorized for third parties.)
If we're doing the mozconfig changes, that makes this a Firefox: Build Config bug.
The other option here would be to back it out of mozilla-beta & release, and make sure we never merge it over again, wouldn't it?
"making sure we never merge it" seems difficult and error-prone, I'll try the mozconfig changes.

mozconfig patch

This should have the desired effect, I think, and maintain current behavior. I have no idea how I could actually test this, though, short of landing it... Any suggestions there?
./mach python build/compare-mozconfig/compare-mozconfigs-wrapper.py passes locally with that patch, so at least that part was tested.

You could push to try with this + hardcoding MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL to different things to test this, I think...

looks ok to me. the whitelist changes look a bit odd, but they usually do.
Pushed to try with the MOZ_UPDATE_CHANNEL hardcoded in the mozconfig:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=a7fc3bb0b789 ("beta")
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=7f8624fbb0df ("nightly")

The compare-mozconfigs failed for all of those because I didn't updated the whitelist, but the "beta" builds didn't get the prefix, and the "nightly" builds did, so I think this is good to go.

Going to take this on Aurora to simplify bug 1090324.
So excited you forgot to mark the bug!
