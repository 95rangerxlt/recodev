You guys use non-Ubuntu Linux systems with non-default themes if I am not mistaken, so could you tell me if this works for you?
Maybe force the background to a lighter color and thus be sure it'll work regardless of the default theme?
I'm afraid that a light tooltip background would look out of place, since all other apps use the dark one.
Our tools don't really try to respect the system theme though :) But I don't feel strongly about it.

this is better, but why do we need to make this text red?

But we never modify the tooltip background in Firefox either to my knowledge, so I dunno :-)

This is a legitimate question, I think Victor just wanted to make false attributes more prominent and harder to miss. Not sure how important this is.
I found black crossed out text to not entirely stand out from ordinary text, in which case "non-enumerable" might be confused as actually being "enumerable". The subtle red helped.
Let's get this simple fix in and keep thinking about whether it makes sense to change the tooltip background or the red color:
