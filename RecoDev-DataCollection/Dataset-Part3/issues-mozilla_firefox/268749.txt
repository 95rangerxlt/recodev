This is not a bug with Firefox but rather with the Help Documentation, which
incorrectly suggests the key is Cmd when it's really Ctrl.  You can use Ctrl to
do this, not Cmd.  We just goofed when we were writing the Help documentation on
keyboard shortcuts (partially because the people who write Help docs don't own
Macs, unfortunately), and this is a problem in both the website and the built-in
Help, as evidenced by the following code for handling two of the three special
ways of entering a URL for autocompletion:

Both Cmd+Return and Cmd+Shift+Enter need to be fixed for this (Cmd->Ctrl).

This should be trivial to fix for releases after 1.0, so look to see it fixed
for then (in built-in Help).  We can fix this relatively quickly on the website,
I'm sure.

This is not the case.  Ctrl does not work either.  In fact, when I press
Ctrl+Enter, not only does the expected behavior not happen, but I get no
response whatsoever from the browser.  Ctrl+Shift+Enter is the same.  There
seems to be a problem not only with the documentation, but also with the
location bar and/or keybindings.
David, does Shift+Enter work for www.[text].net? 

For now, I've removed the shortcuts from the online documentation.

Shift+Enter does work.
