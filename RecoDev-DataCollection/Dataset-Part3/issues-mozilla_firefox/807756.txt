Thanks for noticing and fixing this. I wonder why it worked without before though. Is the //modules path aliased by /gre/modules?

It is in Firefox, but not necessarily in other embeddings.

Currently platform and app resources end up in the same dist/bin directory for fx builds. This will change with the work in bug 755724. The metro repo on Elm has bug 755724's experimental work in it, so when bug 707302 merged over some tests broke. Hence the filing of this bug.
