STR:
1. Add a console log to _removePanelCustomizationPlaceholders
2. Open customize mode from the toolbar, or using session restore, or any other way that means the panel isn't yet initialized

ER:
It gets called once because _showPanelCustomizationPlaceholders calls it

AR:
It gets called 2N times, for N items in the menupanel. Once to hide, once to reshow after the node has been added (which calls into hide again for good measure).
