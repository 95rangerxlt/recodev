Anytime a PDF link is clicked, Firefox automatically downloads the file in Download Manager and opens it in Preview.  Firefox also spawns an unending number of Firefox windows.  The CPU usage goes to 100%, I cannot get back to my original window, and I must use Force Quit and restart Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link to a PDF file.
Actual Results:  
PDF file completes downloading in Download Manager, and it opens in Preview.  Continually, blank Firefox windows are opened and I must use Force Quit and restart Firefox.

Expected Results:  
PDF downloads in Download Manager and opens in Preview, with no additional Firefox windows opening.

I disabled all extensions and the bug still exists.

Possibly the same bug as 366977, in which case the user had the same problem with .SWF files.

When I reopen Firefox and Download Manager, I can click the PDF file and it will open in Preview without opening any additional Firefox windows.  The bug seems to only exist when originally downloading the file.

Originally, the bug report was filed based on Firefox 2.0.0.1 running on Mac OS X Tiger.

The error condition still occurs in Firefox 2.0.0.13 and Firefox 3 beta 5, both now being run on the same computer using Mac OS X Leopard.

In Firefox 3 beta 5, at least, the error produces as many partial files as windows that opened.  The partial files are all zero-length, and are named with eight random characters with the extension "pdf.part".

I can't duplicate the issue with my version. I get a box asking me to download or open with preview. The PDF opens with preview no problem.
Also, I'm running OS X 10.5.5.

Just had the same problem on an extra windows desktop machine.  Root cause on my machine:  
1.  No Adobe Reader Installed
2. Tools/Options/Content/File Types had pdf associated with "default" (i.e. firefox) 
3. Had checked the box in the popup "Always open with this program"
Result:  was an endless loop of tabs opening.  
Resolution:  Install Adobe Reader, Associate pdf in firefox with Adobe Reader
Done.

Good luck.
I do not get the box that asks to download or open with Preview.

Thanks Mark, but I wish it were that easy on a Mac (or at least on my Mac).  For some reason, PDF is not an option under file types.  That may be why I don't get the box that asks to download or open with Preview.
PDF download works for me in FF 2 & 3 on 10.4 & 10.5 (both PPC & x86).

Bond, in FF3 -> Preferences -> Applications, search for "doc".
Thanks for the reply, but searching for "doc" yields nothing.  Searching for "pdf" yields nothing either.

I'm convinced that simply having an "Add Application" button would fix this problem... there's no easy way to add PDF files to this list.
This bug has been unconfirmed over a year. Is this "critical" bug still a problem? If I don't get a reply within 72 hours, I'll close it out as Invalid.
This bug no longer shows up on my Mac.  It now asks if I want to open in Preview, or if I want to save.  I am using Firefox 3.5.10 and OS X 10.6.4.
