Crash Address	0x0
User Comments	I was exiting Mozilla browser, and Firefox crashed. This keeps happening normally when I start Mozilla or Thunderbird email. Either of these can crash Firefox which I almost always have running. It is only recently this has been happening, maybe since a firefox upgrade. It did not happen in the same circumstances previously.

you should be able to find the symbols for these dll's and look up the address to see what it's calling. you can use:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/How_to_get_a_stacktrace_with_WinDbg
to get symbols for firefox/windows and integrate it with symbols for your code.
We believe the problem was resolved in our latest versions.
If someone still encounters this issue, please contact support@trusteer.com or download Rapport latest version and see if the problem still occurs.
Do you have a way to push updates to your users?  If so, can we blocklist the crashing versions?
