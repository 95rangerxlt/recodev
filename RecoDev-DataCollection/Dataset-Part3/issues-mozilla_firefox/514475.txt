I tend to agree, but think we need Johnath's sign-off before doing it. The strings that get added to Larry in bug 435035 will help, of course, but I wonder if we want to also move the "broken lock" graphic into the identity panel before removing the status bar indicator?
Bug 530758 is related to this, there is an issue of the hover text differences between the address bar button and the ssl icon being confusing as well as the duplication of functionality at issue here.
The padlock is the *only* place where mixed-content SSL warnings are visibly shown (save the "Technical Details" section in Page Info), so please don't get rid of it wholesale without adding that functionality to somewhere else in the UI so I can notice mixed-content problems easily.
fixed along with bug 574688
