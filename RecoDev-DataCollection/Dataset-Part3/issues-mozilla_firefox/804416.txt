If there are cached notification icons for a provider, then you disable social and restart, those cached items are still used, even though they are not visible.  This can result in errors in the js console:

only use the toolbar cache when provider is active.

We probably want this in aurora/beta too as it may appear as though the provider is being "pinged" even when disabled.
