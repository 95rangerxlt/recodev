Bump Firefox version on trunk to 1.6a1.

Bump Firefox version on trunk to 1.6a1.
I think "1.6a1" is not allowed because of the "a" inside and the people could
get confused because of the Gecko version "1.9a1".

A possible solution would be "1.5+". But in that case all extensions would break
because of the wrong max version in their install.rdf.
1.6a1 is allowed by the new version-number parser. AMO might not be updated to
allow that format yet.

The new version number scheme has one major problem for extension authors:

If we'd like to set extensions maxversion to something like 1.6a1, to allow
testing with the alpha/beta builds, everyone could use the extensions with the
(not yet released) 1.5 stable/final builds.
Comment 5: minVersion?

No.

Setting the minVersion to 1.6a1 would break the extensions for the old 1.0.x
Thunderbird / Firefox versions.
