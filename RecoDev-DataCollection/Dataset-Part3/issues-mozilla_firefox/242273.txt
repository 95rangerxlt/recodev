So, Michael, you want Firefox to have a Mail button to launch your default Mail
client, yes?

Greg, yes that is what I was hoping for.  If I am correct this feature is
available in the Windows version, is it not? I have the understanding that it
has not been activated in FireFox for OS X. Thought it would be a nice option
for the OS X folks as well.  If the Mozilla Gods are listening I would like a
menu button for "Send Link" as well, but I know that the goal is to keep the
browser as lean as possible.
I can't see another bug for this, so confirming.
fixed in bug 274374.
