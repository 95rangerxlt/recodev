It's my understanding that the UI will be not as nice as it could be, but not actually broken by this change.

It's my understanding that the UI will be not as nice as it could be, but not actually broken by this change.
So, basically undoing these changes:
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (jsbBraceStyleDesc) A very short description of the
 # 'jsb <braceStyle>' parameter. This string is designed to be shown
 # in a menu alongside the command name, which is why it should be as short as
 # possible.
-jsbBraceStyleDesc=Collapse, expand, end-expand, expand-strict
+jsbBraceStyleDesc=Select the coding style of braces
 
 # LOCALIZATION NOTE (jsbBraceStyleManual) A fuller description of the
 # 'jsb <braceStyle>' parameter, displayed when the user asks for help
 # on what it does.
-jsbBraceStyleManual=The coding style of braces. Either collapse, expand, end-expand or expand-strict
+jsbBraceStyleManual=<p class="nowrap">The coding style of braces. Select from one of the following:</p><ul><li>collapse<br/><pre>if (x == 1) {\n  ...\n} else {\n  ...\n}</pre></li><li>expand<br/><pre>if (x == 1)\n{\n  ...\n}\nelse\n{\n  ...\n}</pre></li><li>end-expand<br/><pre>if (x == 1) {\n  ...\n}\nelse {\n  ...\n}</pre></li><li>expand-strict<br/><pre>if (x == 1)\n{\n  return // This option can break scripts\n  {\n    a: 1\n  };\n} else {\n  ...\n}</pre></li></ul>

In Axel's absence, including Stas to see if this is a desirable fix to pick up for Aurora.

This patch has not changed l10n string names, so localizers will not notice change in l10n. Please, change string names. At least for aurora.

The idea of this patch is to back out some late changes that didn't change string names. So this is a revert.

Several locales has already translated these late changes - http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla-aurora/search?find=%2F&string=jsbBraceStyleManual%3D%3Cp+class%3D%22nowrap%22%3E
How are they gonna notice that these changes have been reverted?
