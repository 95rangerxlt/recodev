It's been a few weeks since SDK uplift into FX-team -- in that time, bug 910594 has landed, which allows to requiring of .json with SDK loader
   require('./package.json')

In escodegen in devtools, this is done to include the package.json, only for the version number. As a work around on dev tools, the package.json was renamed to 'package.json.js', and added a `module.exports =` in there to be a valid JS file, as the SDK loader could only load js files at the time.

This patch is for commenting out the line in escodegen temporarily, as when the new changes in loader hits fx-team, this will cause devtools to break, as its ambiguous without checking file existence on load whether `require('./package.json')` is for package.json or package.json.js (as we remove '.js' in require files).

y u no indent?

Maybe make a comment in the UPGRADING file? Not a huge deal since we are replacing escodegen.

Added indent, added info of reasoning in UPGRADING.md
FYI, "checkin-needed" is a keyword, not a whiteboard thing.
Thanks, eagle-eye!
