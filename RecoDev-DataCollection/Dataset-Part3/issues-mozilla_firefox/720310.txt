Nit: Maybe merge those two comments and put them above BrowserCharsetReload()?
In browser.js, why don't you just call BrowserCharsetReload() directly, and avoid adding a useless CharsetReload()?

Same question applies to [Browser]SetForcedCharset.

The comment is no longer needed. You'll also need to update comm-central's suite/browser/browser.js accordingly.
