User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130507 Firefox/23.0
Build ID: 20130507040202

Steps to reproduce:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130507 Firefox/23.0 (UX Branch)

Before entering customization mode by using the panel menu -> Customize, I am able to resize the search bar by using the splitter between the search bar and the address bar.


Actual results:

After entering customization mode, the search bar cannot be resized using the splitter unless Firefox is restarted.


Expected results:

I should be able to resize the search bar after exiting customization mode.

While it's not clear if this has landed ON UX, I can confirm that this bug is fixed for me using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130511 Firefox/23.0

Thanks!
All patches landed in Jamun have now been merged to UX. Thanks for confirming.
Rather than creating a new bug, I'll just continue this one...

I cannot resize the searchbar/address bar at all again, even in safe mode, using my normal UX only profile.  Has this function been removed?

No, this function has not been removed.

Can you give us steps to reproduce from a fresh profile?
Unfortunately, no, I cannot, because it works in a new profile, just not in my profile I started just a couple of months ago, even in safe mode.  I'll see if I can "break" it in the clean profile by doing my usual customizations, save my usual extensions.
I used the "Restore Defaults" button while in the new customization mode and the searchbar/addressbar is now resizable.  Sorry the bugspam.  :D
