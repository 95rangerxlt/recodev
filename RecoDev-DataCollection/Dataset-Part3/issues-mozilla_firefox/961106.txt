After several hundred tests in mochitest-browser-chrome test runs, I see ~1k observers for author-style-disabled-changed in about:memory.  The only place those are added is here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/content/content-sessionStore.js#323

and they are never removed.  They are weak observers, but that probably doesn't matter either, as that event is rather rare.

It looks like we'd really need to be notified when a frame script is destructed, so we could do some cleanup, but there's no such notification currently.

It might be useful to comment that the gFrameTree observers don't need to be removed because gFrameTree will die with the content script, and it holds the observers. And the privacy transition thing is okay because it's on the docshell, which will die along with the tab.

Do you mind changing the "weak" parameter to false. I don't think that setting it to true is helping us, and I think it would be good to reduce the number of places where we use weak observers.
Is this definitely new to FF27?  Should we be looking for a regression range here?
Bug 930967 is what regressed this.
Yeah, this has been introduced with Fx 28.

Good idea.
