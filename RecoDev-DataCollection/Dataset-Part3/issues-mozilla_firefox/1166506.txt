Now that we are auto expanding the contents of nodes (bug 892935) and collapsing whitespace in the view (bug 1046803), we should update the styles to make it look nicer.  We should use the default devtools-monospace font (which changes per OS)

Probably worth adding yourself as mentor and marking as a [good ... bug], unless you intended to tackle it yourself.
I thought the tricky part was going to be making sure the sizing is right across all OSes.  I needed to do some exploring to figure out exactly what guidance I would give and in the process have a pretty much working patch, so I'll just take it

linux just uses the default monospace font for devtools-monospace, so it doesn't end up looking any different

What do you think?  Just resets the font to inherit.  While I was in there I noticed we weren't doing that comment thing that's done throughout the markup-view templates for inline-block children, so added that too

I'm not seeing a huge difference, but I trust your eye for details. I've applied the patch and it looked good locally anyway, and the code changes are fine.
