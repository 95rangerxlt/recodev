Why double under?

And maybe 'current' might be more obvious than 'child'? next/prev/child are siblings, but the names might suggest that child is a nephew of next/prev?

And further down, I'm getting unclear that I'm understanding properly. I'm feeling lazy, please could you add some docs describing this. I'm sure if I'm having to check up and down then docs can help.

We need to setup this.__prev?

child is a nephew of next/prev, hopefully the comments cleared that up.

Let me know if I can clarify anything more.

_prev is nulled a bit earlier in the function.
