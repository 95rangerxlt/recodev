The new URL notifications that show up at the bottom left corner of the page break find-in-page by hiding anything that's been found.

To reproduce: go to a page with a lot of linked text, like
http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html

Search once in the page for a string that occurs repeatedly, e.g. dialog.
Once you've found it, run "Find again", Ctrl-G.
Notice that the page scrolls, but you can't see where the match is.

The match is at the bottom left of the page -- but it's a link, so the URL notifier popped up right on top of the matched text.

The only way to see whether it actually found a match is to scroll a few lines down (e.g. with the mousewheel).

If this notifier is always going to pop up blocking page content, find-in-page should scroll so that the match is above the notifier, and visible.

Is there a term for the URL popup notifier? I searched for an existing bug, but wasn't sure what term to search for.

WFM. At least I think so, because I see no obvious problem.

The "URL notifier" is probably the new Status Bar.

Does the issue still occur if you start Firefox in Safe Mode?

How about with a new, empty profile?

Yes, I tested it with a brand-new profile before reporting the bug. Same thing happens if I start with that pristine profile in safe mode, and in every profile I have, whether or not they're showing a status/add-ons bar.

Are you not seeing what I describe? Would screenshots help?

Screenshot showing the url hiding the matched text

Attaching two screenshots taken with a new profile. The first shows what it looks like right after typing Ctrl-G -- the URL at the bottom is hiding the matched text, so it looks like nothing was found. The second is what it looks like after I mouse out of the window and wait a while for the URL popup to disappear, un-hiding the text.

Thanks for the screen shots!

When I tested before, the Status Bar always jumped to the right side of the screen, but that was because I didn't close the Find Bar before running Find Again.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html
2. Open then Find bar and search once for "dialog"
3. Close the Find bar
4. Run "Find Again" multiple times by using Ctrl+G (for Linux and Windows)

Actual Results: The Status Bar hides the search results when they appear to the left at the bottom of the page.

Expected Results:
The status bar doesn't hide the search results, either by scrolling the page upwards or moving the Status Bar to the right of the screen.
This problem was already pointed out in bug 631270, comment 21, but that bug is VERIFIED FIXED without taking that into account.
I've noticed this behavior, and would definitely appreciate a fix.

Just came across this one too, very annoying when searching through API pages!  Would've been so much nicer if the old status bar had just stayed put :-)

The switching of the URL while hovering over a link from left to right works beautifully. However, I have a related issue.
I personally use "Search for text when I start typing" feature, F3 to get to the next result and the bar still being displayed or having popped away does not seem to make a difference.

When finding text on the left side of a page, everything is fine. What, however, if you search for text that is displayed on the right to find matching text that is displayed on the left of a page like, in tables/lists, for example.

Would adding an instruction to hide the hover-over link upon jumping to a next search result and using the present code after the mouse has been moved be possible? Or is a little scrolling up which was mentioned here still on the table?


Actual Results: The Status Bar hides possibly relevant information on the left when the search result is on the right of the page.

Expected Results: Since the browser cannot anticipate what text is supposed to be shown, the complete bottom line should be visible.
Yes, guys. This bug is really annoying. Please fix it. Thanks.
