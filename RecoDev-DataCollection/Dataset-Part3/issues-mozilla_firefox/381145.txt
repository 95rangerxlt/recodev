STR:

open the browser, shut it down right as the gui becomes visible.

expected results: the bookmarks toolbar folder in the bookmarks.html file should have the PERSONAL_TOOLBAR_FOLDER attribute.

actual: the toolbar folder does not have the attribute.

fix v1 - do not cache the toolbar folder id in the imp/exp service
Also remember to remove the member variables from the .h file

fix v2 - do not cache any folders id in the imp/exp service
steps to reproduce were:

1)  create a new profile
2)  quit immediately
3)  start back up in firefox 2.x (or check your bookmarks.html) and PERSONAL_TOOLBAR_FOLDER="true" was missing
specifically, we saw this this in bookmarks.html:

<H3 ID="6" ICON_URI="chrome://browser/skin/places/bookmarksToolbar.png">Bookmarks Toolbar Folder</H3>

Ugh, this caching was esp. wrong for the toolbar folder id, which could be changed (through the UI) without updating the cached fields. r=mano.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
