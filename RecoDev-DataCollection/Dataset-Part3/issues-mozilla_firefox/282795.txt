------- Additional Comment #1 From Elijah Newren  2005-02-18 19:28 -------

Thanks for the bug report.  This trace indicates that Mozilla (which was being
used by the program) was responsible for the crash.  That appears to match your
description as well.  So you'll need to file a bug report at bugzilla.mozilla.org.
All browsers work fine when run as root. But i do not want to run browsers as root.
Check the FAQ list for your browser

> Check the FAQ list for your browser

I did check all the FAQ! But the problem not only happens with just one browser,
but all of them .. happens with mozilla 1.7.3 , happens with firefox 1.0 and
also with thunderbird!!
Bugzilla is only intended for people working on fixing defects in Mozilla,
not for troubleshooting your set up.

You will get better help at Mozillazine or one of the other resources
linked from the main Firefox page.

I am not sure that advice you received from the gnome folk was correct
(it isn't quite the same as my paragraph above), but their analysis
was. (Clearly the gnome folk are not going to be able to give a precise
diagnosis of a problem that they can show is within Mozilla and not
within gnome).

Let us see if we can help you:

* Step one: Please reproduce the problem with a recent download of Firefox
and a clean profile.

That has already been tried over and over again.  I created a new user, and just
did an apt-get install mozilla-firefox from debian .. getting the firefox 1.0
version. and started the browser for the new user and visted the site,
http://bijur.de/home. success!, then i tried google.comm. Crashes! tried
wikipedia.org. success. Then Mozilla.org. Crashes. 

Sorry for all the trouble, but why is the browser crashing everytime?. Only when
run as root, the browser runs smooth without any issues. Seems like a bug to me. 

Thanks,

Touché. That should be 'download a recent version': one dated 20050221 or
20050220.

Yes you are doing the same thing (outside specification) over and over
again. It is reliably failing the same way over and over again. Firefox
is still finding its feet and has only 17% of the browser population.
Nobody disputes that the Firefox team has put more effort into 
programming than marketing. If there were better, more comprehensible,
relevant and lucid documentation; if installing linux software
were easier, you wouldn't have this problem.

You will get better and quicker help in the forums and other support
mechanisms.

I agree that the observed behaviour (crash) differs from the wanted
behaviour (runs smoothly), but I don't yet know whether this is owing
to a defect in Firefox. (FWIW, your reference to 'root' suggests a
permissions problem).

I run Firefox on Suse and on Gentoo, I am not always happy
as these versions are often behind the times: I simply use the
standard installs, and don't file bugs on these versions here.
Support needs to come from the vendor, in your case, Debian.

My guess is that someone else has had your problem - you need to
identify how it was solved, probably by searching the Debian
mailling list. You are definitely unlikely to get a satisfactory
and quick resolution to your problem here unless you are prepared
to install a nightly and follow the Bugzilla rules of engagement.

Maybe you will strike lucky, someone will happen by who recognises
your problem from some part of the description, and tells you what 
to do, but chasing down bugs is a trailing or tracking process
involving data collection and deductive thought. Sometimes there
is no shortcut!

Ben,

Maybe you are right , there are no short cuts and hence I am closing this bug.
Thanks for your advice, though i am still stuck, but i believe i would find a
way to figure this out. Thanks for all your time. 

Thanks,
aVallark
