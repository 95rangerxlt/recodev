patch v1: only enable the runtime for Firefox

1. configure.in enables the runtime for Windows and Mac by defining MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME for those target OSes;

    case "${target}" in
    *darwin*)
        ACCESSIBILITY=
        MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME=1
        ;;
    *)
        ACCESSIBILITY=1
        ;;
    esac
    
    case "$target_os" in
        mingw*)
            NS_ENABLE_TSF=1
            AC_DEFINE(NS_ENABLE_TSF)
            MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME=1
            ;;
    esac

2. only Firefox builds webapprt/ (via its browser/build.mk);

    ifdef MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME
    tier_app_dirs += webapprt
    endif

3. toolkit/mozapps/installer/packager.mk tries to package the runtime if MOZ_WEBAPP_RUNTIME is defined, regardless of what was built;

4. `make package` fails for XULRunner because webapprt/ wasn't built.


The solution seems obvious: only enable the runtime for Firefox.  We could test for MOZ_BUILD_APP=browser in configure.in, but project-specific defines are what confvars.sh is for.  Here's a patch.  Tryserver run:

Dave: the changes are in configure.in and browser/confvars.sh.  Are you ok to review this, or should I get a Build Config peer like bsmedberg to review it?

I don't think anyone else needs to look at this.

Can this be merged to Aurora?

low/no known risk, and getting xulrunner builds for 14 seems pretty useful.
fixed on aurora: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/ef9cb1276f4c
Myk - Trying to figure out what I need to verify here - Could you clarify?
I don't think there's anything to verify here, except possibly that XULRunner nightly builds are no longer busted (at least not for this reason):
