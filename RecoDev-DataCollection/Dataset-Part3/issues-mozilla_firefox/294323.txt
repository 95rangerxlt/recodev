Go to http://www.krickelkrackel.de/testing/fullscreen.htm
and see some toolbars and the statusbar go away.

I don't know if this is security related, but it makes 
spoofing easier.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Missing chrome.


Expected Results:  
I think that this should not be possible.

You're right this shouldn't happen, but it's more of an annoyance than a
security exploit. Might be fairly permanent though: most users probably don't
know about fullscreen mode and wouldn't be able to figure out how to get their
toolbars or menus back (F11 twice) -- especially since any hints on the View
menu are invisible too.
