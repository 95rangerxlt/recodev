_makeURI() called by _checkAndGetURI() throws:

Provide document.baseURI when calling _makeURI() in registerProtocolHandler()

IRCCloud calls registerProtocolHandler(irc,#?/irc_url=%s,IRCCloud) which seems like it should be allowed but does of course only work as long as we provide the baseURI to _makeURI().

Provide document.baseURI when calling _makeURI() in registerProtocolHandler(), v2

Fixed tests.
You can use doc.baseURIObject to avoid needing to call makeURI

Nice.

Following Gavin's suggestion.
Try looks good:

Every-time I go to irccloud now I see a message: "IRCCload has already been added as an application for irc links". That is super annoying.
I will certainly not apologize for fixing this ;) But I see the same issue and we should file another bug and fix that as well. Not sure why we even have that notification as that should just be ignored, imo.
Of course not, thanks for fixing this! The console message was distracting me as well.
