Remove check for iconv from configure.in

Now that we support unicode in the updater.ini we no longer require iconv to compile the updater on win32 (Bug 399153).

We could also remove it from mozilla-1.9.1 if you like.

Doesn't this depend on the unicode installer, too?
That is a separate check

For reference in future; myself, KaiRo, or sgauthiere might be a good CC-candidate; we also have http://dev.seamonkey.at/?d=x&i=mozilla&m=c for tracking sake.

If you ever want to patch c-c at the same time as one of these bugs, you can also r? me.

In this bugs case, being fixed by Bug 543230. Thanks for caring about us anyway!
