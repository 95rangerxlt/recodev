Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8a3) Gecko/20040824 Firefox/0.9.1+

The pkg-config files generated in a firefox build reference mozilla-xpcom and
mozilla-nspr, but the .pc files generated are named firefox-xpcom.pc and
firefox-nspr.pc.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. pkg-config --libs firefox-gtkmozembed

Actual Results:  
Package 'Mozilla Gtk Embedding Widget' requires 'mozilla-xpcom = 0.9.1+' but
version of XPCOM is 1.7.2
(or whatever mozilla build version you have)

Expected Results:

proposed fix
Yeah, let's get this in.

In a more-ideal world, we'd produce mozilla-xpcom and mozilla-nspr and
mozilla-nss from the firefox build as well, and reference them, but I think that
doing that sort of thing now will make firefox-devel and mozilla-devel conflict
badly.

xulrunner and libxul.so are the real solution here, so this is a 1.0-grade fix
in my opinion.

PR1 is already out but this is not yet fixed; can this be committed now, please?
Thanks.
Fixed on the branch.  Sorry for the delay, I suck.

rediff'd patch to apply cleanly to trunk

Apparently this patch was never checked in on trunk. This bug means you cannot
use the firefox-*.pc pkg-config files; so the patch is no-risk and fixes a
important bug.
