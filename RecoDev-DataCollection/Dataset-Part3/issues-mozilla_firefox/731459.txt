it's a bit hard to distinguish visited from unvisited since both icons are quite bright, the visited icon should be less interesting for the user's eyes.

I put together some changes just to get an idea, though this are far from being final. The first one is current, the second one is the limit (already discarded but useful for the comparison), the third one adds opacity to background and border, the fourth one uses a border similar to the empty favicon.

note that the opacity effect can easily be confused with "cut" nodes that indeed get some transparency.

Yeah I think the second from the left (just waves, no box) works the best. Very nice, thank you! :)

Looks like the glow on the unread icon got darker: http://cl.ly/3p0c1V1v1A432e023E1J
