While the debugger is paused, the resume button is colored differently but has no background hover effect. It should, because just like the other buttons, it's clickable.

Sounds like a regression from the toolbars thinification or design flattening?

This is an issue even on stable (30) before any of the latest changes, but I agree that it should have a different background on hover.  Before the flattening it was more obviously 'active' so the the lack of a hover effect was less noticeable.
I'll update this

There are a couple of options here.  The resume button is 'special' right now in that it doesn't currently receive the same [checked] background everything else does.  

One solution (in this patch) is to make it not special anymore, and then also fix all of the other [checked]:hover states to make it better.  This changes the UI a bit more (it becomes normal icon state with a blue bg instead of normal bg state with a blue icon), but it is more consistent with the rest of the tools.

Another option would be to get rid of the background: none on the resume button when it is [checked]:not(:hover) - in which case it will receive a blueish background on hover as opposed to the greyish one that the stepping buttons receive.
