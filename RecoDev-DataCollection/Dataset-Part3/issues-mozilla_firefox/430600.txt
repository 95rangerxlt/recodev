Thunder, are you sending nulls to this nice generator?
Is this weave-related? I don't call CanAddURI in Weave...
AddVisit does, though, and the stacks all include it.
Do you call AddVisit?

crash fix

could reproduce the crash by passing null to nsINavHistoryService.addVisit.
I do call AddVisit, btw.
But isn't the lack of checking in CanAddURI the real problem? After all, |var foo; Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/nav-history-service;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsINavHistoryService).canAddURI(foo)| in the console is enough to crash.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
