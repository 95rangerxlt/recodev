Andrey,
We are making a big push to try and get as many extensions as possible working for the upcoming release of  Firefox 2 in a few weeks.  Do you know if this extension will be compatible and ready to work with Firefox 2?
AFAIK, if works fine in Beta. So, I'll check it again and change install.rdf as soon as Fx2 will be released. I don't want to disturb reviewers for every beta and rc.
