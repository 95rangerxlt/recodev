I need a list of all of the icons in Firefox that actually use their disabled state.  Here is what I believe the list is:

-Back
-Forward
-Refresh
-Stop
-Cut
-Copy
-Paste
-Report Site
-Tab Close (used for inactive tabs)
-Pause Download (new in Firefox 3)

Here is what I believe is a complete list of all the icons in Firefox 2 that had inactive states that were either never used, or are not used in Firefox 3:

-Web Feed
-History
-Secure
-Tab Arrow End
-Tab Arrow Start
-Bookmarks
-Downloads
-Livemark Folder
-New Tab
-New Window
-Print
-Secure Broken
-Livemark Item
-Search

Am I missing any icons that should have a disabled state, or is anything here wrong?  I'll resolve the bug once I'm confident we have figured this out.

I'll help you with this. I use Windows non-Aero version and Linux. It might be somewhat hard because lots of icons are duplicated, so you have to search the sources to know how and where that specific instance is used.

In the mid time, you might want to use this if you have a UNIX-like operative system, group all icons and images in a common folder (making sure none is overwritten) so viewing them is much easier:

This extracts every jar. Execute it inside the firefox folder:

for i in `find . -name "*.jar"`; do unzip -d "${i%.jar}" "${i}"; done

This copies every image to an image folder. Save it to a file, give it the proper the mode (755) and execute it inside the firefox folder.

#!/bin/sh

mkdir images

for i in `find .-name "*.bmp" -or \
		-name "*.gif" -or \
		-name "*.jpg" -or \
		-name "*.jpeg" -or \
		-name "*.png"`; do

	name=`basename "${i}"`

	while [ -e "images/${name}" ]; do

		name="_${name}"

	done

	cp "${i}" "images/${name}"
done
In Linux:

Hightlight all (find.png)
Page (folder-item.png)
Ratings (ratings.png)
Star Page (starPage.png)
Unstarred (unstarred48.png)

In Windows:

Page (folder-item.png)
Ratings (ratings.png)
Star Page (starPage.png)
Unstarred (unstarred48.png)

For some reason, Windows does not show Hightlight all as disabled when Find bar search box is empty, so I didn't include it.

Firefox 3 and Firefox 2 find toolbars on Vista

On Vista, there are currently no disabled versions of Next and Previous (as well as Highlight All, which Andres already mentioned.)

Not only in Vista, but in Windows XP too.
We got these all refresh in Firefox 3, resolving.
