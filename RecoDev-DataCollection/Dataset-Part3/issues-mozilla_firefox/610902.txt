To help reduce the visual complexity of sub-menus in the Firefox menu, keyboard shortcuts should appear in grey text.

We may also decide to apply this styling to the traditional menu on Vista and 7 as well.  On XP, there is more of a precedent for the visual design of traditional menu bars, since they are found everywhere on the platform.  So on XP we should just continue using a native appearance.

FYI: This patch still applies cleanly.

I have changed the patch to use the child selector and added a new class, |appmenu_keyboard-shortcut|, to menuitems that have keys associated with them.

Patch for bug 610902

Extensions' menu items are going to lack the appmenu_keyboard-shortcut class, making the styling inconsistent.

I'm not sure I understand the rationale behind this bug; these menus don't seem visually more complex than other menus... So we should probably do nothing about this or do it for all menus.

This patch uses Margaret's approach but extends the graytext to the "alt" menus.

How concerned should we be about the performance of the descendant selectors here?

>+  #appmenu-popup .menu-accel,
>+  #appmenu-popup .menu-iconic-accel,
>+  #main-menubar .menu-accel,
>+  #main-menubar .menu-iconic-accel {
>+    color: graytext;
>+  }

At this point, it looks like #appmenu-popup and #main-menubar are redundant in these selectors.

Thanks for the review Dao. I have updated the patch to only have the class selectors.

Apparently the section where you're adding this affects Windows XP, which wasn't part of the plan. Please move this to the windows-default-theme section in browser-aero.css.

I've moved the styles to the windows-default-theme portion of browser-aero.css.
