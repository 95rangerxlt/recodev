The function passed to Tabs.onFocus() is supposed to be called every time the browser switches to a new tab, but it seems to get called only sporadically, and sometimes even when it shouldn't. 

One complicating factor is that we used to use it to know when we were switching to TabCandy, but TabCandy's no longer a tab. Does it make sense for it to still get called when switching to TabCandy (maybe with a null or something), or should we have a separate API for that?

At any rate, we need Tabs.onFocus() to be reliable again; it's causing a lot of issues with the zoom in/out feature.

Patch 1

Yes, the tabSelect event isn't fired every time when switching tabs.  I've created a patch which should fix the zoom in/out issues.
Why isn't it fired every time? Seems like we should be fixing that, rather than hacking around it. 

Applying the patch does fix some of the zooming issues, but there are others. For instance: 

1. In the TabCandy UI, make a group with multiple tabs in it. 
2. Click into one of those tabs.
3. Switch to a different tab within that group (without switching back to TabCandy). 
4. Now switch back to TabCandy. Note that the animation you see is of zooming out of the tab you originally zoomed into, not the tab you were just in. 

We need to know when the browser changes tab focus, even when we have nothing to do with causing the change. 

Here's another, possibly related, issue (copied from EtherPad):

"Closing a tab in Tabcandy in a  group causes big-time issues. Create a new tab in a group which has  more than one tab. While in tabcandy, close that tab. The tab to its  left will instantly because large. This seems to be an intermitant bug, so probably related to the onFocus issue?"

This issue is still present after applying the patch. 

I'm going to push the patch so we can move forward; please continue to refine.
The "TabSelect" event stops firing when the following error occurs. I am checking to see whether this is something to do with Tab Candy or the Firefox core code itself.

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsITypeAheadFind.setDocShell]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml :: updateCurrentBrowser :: line 887"  data: no]

Patch 2

Ian: I've added a try/catch to catch an error in the tabbrowser.xml and the TabSelect is working correctly.  May be we should talk to someone who owns the tabbrowser module about that?

Patch 3

A patch to prevent the hide chrome code to run when a tab is just closed and it's already in the tab canndy interface.
Raymond, I've applied patch 2 in: 

http://hg.mozilla.org/users/edward.lee_engineering.uiuc.edu/tabcandy-central/rev/d4a42b589b7c

... but patch 3 had conflicts (I must have applied your various patches in the wrong order). Can you please provide an updated patch 3? Sorry about that.

Patch 3 (Updated)
Thanks for the updated patch! Pushed: 

http://hg.mozilla.org/users/edward.lee_engineering.uiuc.edu/tabcandy-central/rev/59ffae7b0983

Reassigning to Mardak to follow up about the exception mentioned above.
Adding Dietrich to see if he has any insight given his work on the Tabs module for Jetpack.
Raymond, can you file a bug for just the tabbrowser change, attach just that bit of the patch, and cc me?
