When you open a Web Console in a tab, the Web Console menu is checked and stays checked as long as you haven't closed it.
When you switch to a tab without an open Web console, it should be unchecked.

>+function onShowWebDeveloperMenu() {

please rename this to onWebDeveloperMenuShowing

>+  gBrowser.selectedTab.linkedBrowser.ownerDocument.getElementById("Tools:WebConsole").setAttribute("checked", HUDConsoleUI.getOpenHUD() != null);

'gBrowser.selectedTab.linkedBrowser.ownerDocument' is the same as 'document'

General approach looks good!
