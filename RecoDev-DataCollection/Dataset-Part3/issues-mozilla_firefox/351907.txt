After the changes in Bug 351759, autoconfig.css located in mozilla/toolkit/themes/winstripe/global in the tree points to the wrong location for autocomplete-dropmark-arrow.png and autocomplete-dropmark-bkgnd.png. I've attached a patch to fix this issue. I've tested it and after making these changes to fix the path, the autocomplete arrow again appears correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Fixes broken autocomplete dropdown arrow

This fixes the problem described above.
Also, when they were moved, autocomplete-dropmark-arrow.png and autocomplete-dropmark-bkgnd.png no longer appear to be in the tree as binary files. When I pull the files from the tree (or when I check them within the jars of the latest tinderbox builds), they are not valid png files and can't be viewed. I don't have CVS access, so I can't change this. I don't think that is a new bug, since it is related to resolving this bug. Once my patch is applied, and these images are made binary in the tree, this bug should be resolved.

Here's the attached image showing where the arrow would show if it could find the images.

Sorry, I should have noticed it too.

Re-landing images.  (I could have just set the binary flag, as it turns out, but I didn't realize that until after I'd landed them again.) This background image also has the correct alpha channel (transparency), fixing that part of bug 351770.
