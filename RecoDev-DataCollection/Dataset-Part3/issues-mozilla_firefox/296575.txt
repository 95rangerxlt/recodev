hmm,

it doesn't work with http://www.nu.nl/
the page has multiple rss links, but that isn't the problem (tested that)
I saved the page local and can't reproduce it that way either.
server problem ? http://web-sniffer.net/?url=http%253A//www.nu.nl/


Hmm...

Here I see the Problem:
1. Goto nu.nl
2. Notice: The RSS-Icon is there
3. Goto another Page without RSS-Icon
4. Go back
5. Notice: The RSS-Icon is not in the statusbar

Here I DON'T see the Problem:
1. Goto nu.nl
1b. Click on 'Sport' in the navigation
2. Notice: The RSS-Icon is there
3. Goto another Page without RSS-Icon
4. Go back
5. Notice: The RSS-Icon IS DISPLAYED in the statusbar
> It doesn't work with http://www.nu.nl/

I confirm this.
Reopening this bug.(In reply to comment #6 and #7)



This bug seems to be very strange.

If I safe the page on my harddisc, the Problem is not reproduible, so creating a
testcase is nearly impossible. 

The Bug is reproducible with disabled Images, JavaScript, Java, Cookies and so on.

The HTTP-Header given from http://web-sniffer.net/?url=http%253A//www.nu.nl/
seems to be OK, IMHO, and there is no (big) difference between the Sports-Page,
which works.

There are no significant errors in the JavaScript-console, only a few
CSS-parsing-errors.

When Inspecting the Page with the DOM-Inspector after going back (step 4), it
seems, that the Link-Tags for the RSS-ICON are still present and umodified.

PS: I did not found any other Page with the same bug, too.
Anyone still seeing this?  I'm not able to reproduce it with a current trunk
build on Linux, using the nu.nl site.

I confirm, even the nu.nl site seems to work.
Resolving this to FIXED.


I'm afraid to say that is it not fixed (any more).

I'm using Nightly (currently 25.0a1 (2013-06-30)) under Ubuntu 10.10. and this is the bug and how to reproduce it:

1. Go to a webpage that has a feed, e.g., http://www.nytimes.com/.
2. Notice the RSS icon in the address bar.
3. Click on it. The feed view should open. (There is only one feed, thus no select box pops up.)
4. There is no RSS icon in the address bar right now. This is OK.
5. Click on the back button (or press Alt+Left or Shift+WheelUp).
6. The main page loads again, but without the RSS icon.
7. When switching tabs, the RSS icon re-appears again without further reload of the webpage.

Thus, it seems to be a refresh problem of the GUI, not of the data in the web page itself.
(In reply to buggybugmcbug from comment #12)

a) you should file a new Report and not comment on ancient closed Reports.
b) there's no RSS Icon within the URL bar anymore since Firefox 4. There's a Toolbar Button provided (non-standard) as its Replacement. Extension?
Sorry. Indeed the feed icon had been removed from Firefox, I restored it with this extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/rss-icon/ and then forgot about it.

No need to re-open this bug report.
