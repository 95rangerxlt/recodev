There seems to be no way to reach the "Tabs from other devices" view in Australis, short of pressing alt and invoking the old-school menus.

Yeah, it seems like it's missing from the history widget.

Marking as P3 since this existed in the Firefox menu prior to Australis.

Preemptively bumping to P2 because Sync is a big-deal again.

This looks OK to me. We could theoretically also use the Weave object from a window if we were checking things, but then we'd have to pass windows around so this is probably easier. The other thing I noticed is that we don't have a separator after "Clear Recent History" and the history menu does, but that was an issue before this bug...

(could do with a test but I don't know how hard that is... are there tests for the original history menu?)

That can get fixed in bug 928843.

None that I could find, but I wrote one for this.
