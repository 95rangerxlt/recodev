I am not convinced that I have disabled all of our tilt testing so we need a try run in e10s mode to check that.

No errors in try run relating to tilt so I must have disabled everything I needed to.

Actually... let's leave tilt enabled in non-e10s mode if we can.
jwalker suggested that we use the hidden attribute of the command spec to flag them as hidden when in E10S mode. Unfortunately the commands are cached.

We also have no access to the content window or toolbox.target from within the command spec or e.g. api.js in order to check whether the tab is in E10S mode.

Joe, is there anywhere in GCLI that we can filter the commands by the state of the current content window? Currently the best solution I can find is to return "Not available in E10S mode" from a command if context.window === null.

I'm surprised that they're cached, but we can always just do hidden:true for now. Keeps it simple.

Pretty simple:

1. Comment out tilt stuff from browser/devtools/commandline/test/browser_cmd_settings.js
2. Add target.isMultiProcess.
3. Hide Options Panel 3D View checkbox only in E10S mode.
4. Hide Tilt toolbox button only in E10S mode.
5. Disable tilt tests.
6. Hide tilt commands in GCLI for both single and multi-process modes (no other choice here)
7. Because hidden GCLI commands are still executable we display e.g. "The command '%1$S' is not available in multiprocess mode (E10S)" if an attempt is made to execute the commands in E10S mode.

LGTM, but I think Joe would be better suited for this review.

This is just some random boolean pref, not really anything to do with tilt. Maybe a better fix would be to use some other random boolean pref instead.

Asking jwalker for review at vporof's request.

New try run (fixed test):

I'm not clear what's changed?

The only things that need review are:
1. browser/devtools/framework/test/browser_toolbox_options_disable_buttons.js
2. browser/devtools/framework/toolbox.js

In the test we have just disabled tilt checks in E10S mode.

In toolbox.js we have removed tilt from toolboxButtons (allows a bunch of tests to pass without modification) and deal with show / hide separately.

This try should be green:

Couldn't we just s/devtools.tilt.enabled/devtools.gcli.hideIntro/g rather than comment this out?
See comment 9.
Seems a shame to turn tests off when there is such an easy fix.
