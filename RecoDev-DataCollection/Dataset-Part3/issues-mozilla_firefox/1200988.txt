By "switch to full screen", do you mean View -> Enter Full Screen, or an OS window manager full screen method?

I am not seeing issues here on Mac, but it may be Linux specific, or I might not be testing the same thing.
Tried on computers of my coworkers, this issue can be reproduced on Linux and Windows. 

Upon going into Fullscreen (by F11 hotkey or using window manager in linux), menu bar, tabs and navigation bar slides from view (this works as indented), but so does as responsive designer controls (this is bug).

In my tests on Mac OSX going into fullscreen does not autohides menu, etc, maybe it is some how related to this behavior.
I can confirm this on Linux.

danteek, could you try this test build[1] to confirm it solves the issue for you?

No, it is not.

I've done 2 ways to be sure. I have run firefox binary from archive and I installed firefox-nightly package from my distro and changed download url in process of installing to be sure that it will go through normal installation proccess as daily firefox build.
Actually, sorry, it works for a clean profile, but my current one is still bugged.

Nightly would not be fixed yet, I have not landed the patch in mozilla-central, which Nightly is built from.  Only the archive at the link I provided (from our testing infrastructure) will be fixed at the moment.  When I test the try build on my own profile, it does appear to be fixed.

It shouldn't be profile specific.  I am guessing it may be related to how you are starting Firefox.  Let's land this fix in Nightly, and if the issue is still present, please file a new bug and we'll keep tweaking until it's right.
