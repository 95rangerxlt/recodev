Darrin, what was your intent for the timing function here?

good to fix this syntax error, but we need to figure out if all of these values are necessary.

Most of the CSS for the animation was taken directly from shorlander's animation spec. It seems that we only need the first two as the animation only affects 2 properties (transform and opacity) and even then, both would be 'ease', so in theory we should only need one. Maybe Stephen can comment on his intentions?

Unlike for transitions, the timing functions refer to intervals between keyframes, not to properties. See:

http://jsbin.com/niner/2/edit

the square remains square (although the width and height should not be the same if they were eased differently), but you can instead see a 'bump' in the middle of the animation as it switches transition function. Just checked with shorlander, and this should just be using 'ease' throughout all the animation intervals.

Checked with Stephen, this should be what we want.
