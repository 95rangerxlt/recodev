The auto-created bookmark button seems to work fine if the personal-bookmark widget is on the bookmark toolbar.


1. bookmark widget on visible bookmark bar 
   with a             visible menu     bar = NO bookmark button!
   open a             new     window       = NO bookmark button!
   restarted browser  new     window       = NO bookmark button!
   hide and reshow            menu     bar = NO bookmark button!
   hide and reshow            bookmark bar = NO bookmark button!

2. bookmark widget on hidden  bookmark bar 
   with a             visible menu     bar = NO bookmark button!
   open a             new     window       = NO bookmark button!
   restarted browser  new     window       = NO bookmark button!
   hide and reshow            menu     bar = NO bookmark button!
   reshow and hide            bookmark bar = NO bookmark button!

3. bookmark widget on visible bookmark bar 
   with a             hidden  menu     bar = bookmark button on bookmark bar
   open a             new     window       = bookmark button on bookmark bar
   restarted browser  new     window       = bookmark button on bookmark bar
   reshow and hide            menu     bar = bookmark button on bookmark bar
   hide and reshow            bookmark bar = bookmark button on bookmark bar

4. bookmark widget on hidden  bookmark bar 
   with a             hidden  menu     bar = bookmark button on navigation bar
   open a             new window           = bookmark button on navigation bar
   restarted browser  new     window       = bookmark button on navigation bar
   reshow and hide            menu     bar = bookmark button on navigation bar*
   reshow and hide            bookmark bar = bookmark button on navigation bar

   (*) bookmark button disappears while menu is visible

However, I've placed the personal-bookmark widget on the MENU bar for easy recall and dismissal with the ALT key.  With the widget on the menubar, all hell breaks loose and there is no telling where the bookmark button will or will not pop up next especially on new windows or after a restart.

What ultimately is or is not proper behaviour is up to the developers to decide but as it stands now this user does not think the above is correct and certainly not what I would expect.

looks like moving Bookmarks Toolbar Items to menubar it loses the flex, when we run check at startup the element has width 0, while it should take all avail space.
Created attachment 454513
patch v1.0

part of the problem is this missing selector
the other part of the problem is that button is moved to menubar that has autohide = true, thus when we check if element is visible that toolbar could be hidden and the element not visible.
I can probably handle comment 3 in bug 575218 with a different visibility check.
this hides the button if the menubar is not autohide (I did not want to add crazy checks to handle any edge-case, since request is to hide it, just hide it)
