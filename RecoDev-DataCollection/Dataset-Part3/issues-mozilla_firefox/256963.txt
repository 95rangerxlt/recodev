The document.all warning message doesn't show in the JS console in Firefox. I
assume this is because in Firefox, dom.properties is at:

chrome://global/locale/dom/dom.properties

but the backend is attempting to load it from:

chrome://communicator/locale/dom/dom.properties

http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/content/base/src/nsDocumentViewer.cpp#205
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/dom/src/base/nsDOMClassInfo.cpp#348

Presumably the other warnings in dom.properties are never shown either, though I
haven't tested it.

Requesting blocking 1.0PR (don't know if this will affect localizers or not)

document.all Test

In Mozilla a warning appears in the console, in Firefox nothing happens.
does the test need update for the new document.all support?

document.all Test with global reference

include use of global reference. Should show:

Warning: Non-standard document.all property was used. Use W3C standard
document.getElementById() instead.
Source File: file:///C:/temp/documentAll.html
Line: 9

Warning: Element referenced by ID/NAME in the global scope. Use W3C standard
document.getElementById() instead.
Source File: file:///C:/temp/documentAll.html

Fix chrome URI to the dom.properties file

This should be fixed for PR1

Fix chrome URI to the dom.properties file

1.7 branch merge later, eh?

/be
Fixed on the aviary branch. Leaving bug open to figure out if this is needed on
the trunk and/or the 1.7 branch too.
removing blocking? as this is fixed on aviary branch
This is not needed on the trunk or 1.7 branch. I have not centralized the gecko
locale files on the trunk yet, pending announcements/reviews in bug 256188. I
would sure love some module owner approvals there ;)
