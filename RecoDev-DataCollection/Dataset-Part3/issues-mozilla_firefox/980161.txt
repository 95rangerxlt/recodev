1. Using Nightly, enable Shumway addon by setting shumway.disabled pref to false and Flash plugin's click-to-play setting from "Always Activate" to "Ask to Activate".
2. In a non-e10s window, open a simple Flash site like http://www.areweflashyet.com or http://www.zombo.com/ to see Shumway working.
3. Now open the same Flash site in a new e10s window.

RESULT:
Nothing happens. The Flash movie does not load. There is not Shumway button. There are no log messages on the web console.
