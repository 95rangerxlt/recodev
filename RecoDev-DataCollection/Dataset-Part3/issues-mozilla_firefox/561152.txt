People like the ability to selectively invoke session restore. From Reddit thread: “I generally don’t want it, but sometimes it would be very useful, especially when restarting for updates”

Recommendation:
With the new design, we could put “Restart” and “Restart & Save Session” in the “Exit” combomenu.

The other option would be to offer this whenever *we* ask to restart the browser, ie. “Save Session & Restart” being the default button text and behavior. I can't see why we'd need a button that didn't do a session restore on these forced restarts, though.

Furthermore, we should now be able to "opt in" to a session restore using the new locally hosted home tab as well.
Should this be resolved FIXED?
I'm using Firefox 9.0.1. If you set the Home Page to "Mozilla Firefox Start Page" on Preferences panel, a button to "Restore Previous Session" is shown at Firefox start. Furthermore, you have the same option at the History menu, called "Restore Previous Session". Is this you have in mind? If so, this issue could be closed.
Yea, let's close this now. This was all in Firefox 4.
Bug 664314 would be nice to have.
