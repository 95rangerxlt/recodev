The "Summary:" label to the left of the microsummary dropdown is askew. The <xul:row> containing it needs an align="center" attribute like the other rows.

Reproducible: Always

This looks fine to me, but the UI changes in bug 337825 are going to be removing the summary row entirely, so this probably doesn't need to get fixed unless for some reason those changes don't happen.
Per the fix for bug 337825, there's no longer a Summary row in the bookmarks dialogs, so this problem has been resolved.
