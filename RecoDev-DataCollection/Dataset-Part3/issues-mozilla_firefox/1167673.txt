Something like the following (but better, because I can't think right now):

Waterfall: "Graph view giving a holistic overview of what Firefox is doing over time."

Call Tree: "Tabular tree view showing the aggregate hottest functions over the recording."

Flame Chart: "Flame chart of JS functions called over time."

CC'ing :wbamberg because I have a feeling he might have written very similar things already that we can copy and tweak a little if needed.

ni?ing, but I know he's had a busy few weeks
Sorry, I missed this. How many characters do we have? Here's my effort:

Waterfall: (Shows) The different operations the browser is performing during the recording, laid out sequentially as a waterfall.

Call Tree: Highlights bottlenecks in your JavaScript: functions where the browser spent most time during the recording.

Flame Chart: (Shows) The JavaScript call stack over the course of the recording.
Hi,

Where is supposed to add those descriptions?
The markup is in browser/devtools/performance/performance.xul and locales files are in browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/devtools/profiler.dtd and .properties

This patch adds the tooltips that wbamberg suggested in Comment 2.

Thanks, Lin! Looks great. Small comment on the namespacing. We have allocation views being promoted to non-experimental, so it'd be nice to have tooltip for that too. The allocations flamegraph is going away for now, so not worried about a tooltip for that.

f? Will for one more review of the verbiage (we have to update the l10n variable names if we change any text, which is a small hassle), the "JavaScript: functions" in the call tree seems strange, not sure what the ":" means in this case. Also, an idea of the allocation tooltip for the allocations call tree!

Thanks again!

We should probably use `performanceUI.views.*` as the namespace, rather than `performanceUI.options.*` to clarify the differences between these being the view buttons versus the dropdown options

The idea is that it's separating the two halves of the sentence 

"Highlights bottlenecks in your JavaScript" (...that is...) "functions where the browser spent most time during the recording"

The first part "Highlights bottlenecks in your JavaScript" is a high level description of what it shows, and the second part explains what a bottleneck is. But if it's not clear, it's not clear :). How about:

"Highlights JavaScript functions where the browser spent most time during the recording"

> Also, an idea of the allocation tooltip for the
> allocations call tree!

"Shows where your JavaScript allocated memory during the recording" ?
That's much more clear to me, Will, thanks!

Allocation tree tooltip looks good to me, but maybe no "your" JavaScript (because it can track gecko allocations, so not necessarily the developer's code when looking at it), does that make sense?
Running it by fitzgen, who's working on the allocation stuff: "Shows where memory was allocated during the recording."

Waterfall: Shows the different operations the browser is performing during the recording, laid out sequentially as a waterfall.

Call Tree: Highlights JavaScript functions where the browser spent most time during the recording.

Flame Chart: Shows the JavaScript call stack over the course of the recording.

Allocations Tree: Shows where memory was allocated during the recording.

Yes, that makes sense to me.

Thanks for the feedback :)

This patch changes the namespace to "views" and adds the allocation tab's tooltip.

Once I started reorganizing the code in performance.dtd, I had the idea that performanceUI.toolbar might be a better namespace for this. I'm going to attach another patch which uses that namespace and you can decide between the two.

As mentioned in Comment 11, this patch provides an alternate namespace, "toolbar".

Looks great! And you're right, toolbar does sound like a better namespace. I'll merge this in shortly -- thanks for the contribution, Lin!
