In the new "about:debugging" page, there are different Target categories, which all need specific, intuitive and cool-looking icons.

Icons needed:
- Tab (Tabs that don't have a favicon (yet), "Tabs" category)
- Worker (Service Worker, Shared Worker, Other Worker, "Workers" category).
- Device ("Devices" category)

Not needed:
- Add-ons / Extensions (we already have the green puzzle-piece icon).
- Wi-Fi Device / USB Device / Simulator (current plan is to only show the name of a device with no icon).

Ryan or Brian, do you have any idea who I should ping about this? I've never done this before.

I think Helen could help sort this out.  Jan, when I open about:debugging I only see Add-ons and workers.  How do you I see the Tabs and Devices sections?
Happy to help! Same question as Brian above, though.

I believe these features haven't landed yet, so there are only add-ons and workers categories so far.
Ryan is correct, only Add-ons and Workers are available today in about:debugging, but Devices are coming up soon (bug 1212802).

While we'll not necessarily add a Tabs category at first (because it's already easy enough to switch to a particular tab and open a toolbox), the Tab icon is still needed for remote-device tabs where a favicon isn't available.
Thanks for your offer Helen! Please needinfo/ping me if you have any more questions.

I formatted the icons the same way as the panel icons so they might need to be sized up for your needs, janx --> sorry about that! (Same goes for color.)

Great icons! Here is a screenshot of about:debugging using the new SVG icons.

Thanks Helen! The icons look great.

A few nits:
- As discussed on IRC, please shift the workers icon flush to the left.
- Again on IRC, :ntim suggested we should use another icon for tabs, do you agree?
- Also, I'm not sure how to properly position and size the devices icon. Should it be vertically centered?

I made these slightly larger than the icons in the patch because they looked less weighty than :shorlander's puzzle piece.

I agree that we should just use the one that's being used elsewhere: https://github.com/nt1m/firefox-svg-icons/blob/master/navigation/tab.svg

Are you sure these are the right icons ? They show up really tiny for me. I also tried viewing the SVGs on Safari to make sure Firefox wasn't playing tricks, but I get the same result.

Ah, by larger I meant larger within their viewport. The width and height can be messed with in the first <svg> line of the file.

Thanks Helen, the new icons look great!

- They did look "small" because of a viewbox problem (I fixed that by editing the SVG files to change their viewbox from "0 0 40 40" to "0 0 16 16", so no need to change anything).

- The list-item icons (e.g. the icons in front of each worker in the Workers panel) are hard to see in whitesmoke-over-white-background, but I can use a CSS filter to fix that (we probably don't want a light and dark version of each icon, right?)

- The green addon icon looks weird as a category icon. Tim, do you think we should create a separate white version of it? If I cheat with a CSS filter ("grayscale(100%) contrast(300%)") the result isn't great.

I agree that we probably don't want two separate icons just for simplicity sake, but let me know if you decide you'd like more icons anyway!

I attached a new zip with the add-on icon as white (I also switched all of the icons' fill to white --> I think ntim mentioned in #devtools that most of the icons elsewhere are fill="white", not fill="whitesmoke"). Hopefully that looks better janx!

I think this clears ntim.

Yeah, an invert(1) filter and possibly an opacity filter should be enough.

It's more precisely #fbfbfb (see our in-content prefs icons), so yeah, nearly white.

Thanks Helen! Here is a screenshot with the new icons.

The white add-on icon looks a little bit stretched towards the right, not sure if I'm doing something wrong here.

As you can see in the Workers tab, the white icons can be made grey with the CSS filter "invert(30%)", so we don't need sprites or multiple icons for now! \o/
(In reply to Tim Nguyen [:ntim] from comment #18)
> Yeah, an invert(1) filter and possibly an opacity filter should be enough.

Good suggestion! In my screenshot, I use invert(30%), but I might add an additional filter like opacity or grayscale.

Ah, then we should use #fbfbfb I guess.

This is easier to see when you visually compare the white and green addon icons. Maybe another viewbox problem? I was able to mitigate it by changing the viewbox from "0 0 16 16" to "0 0 18 16", maybe the original icon isn't completely square.

Seems like the right viewBox is "0 0 18 18".

Janx, does this fix the skewing problem?

Thanks for being so patient :)

Helen, thanks again for the new icons!

It looks like "0 0 18 18" does fix the skewing problem (not sure why but hey, it works!)

I took the liberty of editing your original patch to include the final icons.
