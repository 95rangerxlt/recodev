As a user, when I open the context menu (where permitted) on an Encrypted Media Extensions media playback element I am presented with a menu item that alerts me to the fact that the content being played back may be protected by DRM and may also limit my ability to perform certain operations so that I am aware of the limitations being intentional, and learning more about why those limitations are in place.
