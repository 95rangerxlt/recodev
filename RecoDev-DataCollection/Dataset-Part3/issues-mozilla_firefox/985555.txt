It is pretty easy to endup with a blank markup view when browsing one tab history. We end up with various exception about contentWindow or document being undefined. A big part of these exceptions are due to bug 985549.

prevent creating multiple markup view iframes when browsing in history

A first patch, that fix the most easy to reproduce exception.
With it applies, it is significantly harder to get a blank markup view.
We were creating multiple markup view frames, as we are receiving
multiple will-navigate/navigate message in very short period of time.
So that _onNewRoot is called two times, but this._getDefaultNodeForSelection()
only resolves *after* the second call to _onNewRoot happens...

Another patch, to get rid of all other exception.
With this additional one, I'm unable to break the inspector,
even when switching from document to document very quickly!

But I'd prefer fixing this issue right into xul if that's possible.
This patch mainly confirm bug 985549.

I am able to repro the issue fixed in Attachment 8393633 without the patch applied consistently through the following steps:

* Open inspector tab
* Navigate to http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
* Navigate to chrome://browser/skin/devtools/dark-theme.css
* Press back then forward again before the mozilla site loads again
* See error in console: this._markupFrame.contentWindow is undefined

I can confirm that the patch fixes the issue, but I agree that this should be fixed by xul if possible, since this is a surprising error that could affect other tools

Code looks good, and try push looks green so far: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=e8802de16bdd.

This first patch is already good to take.
The second one will most likely take some time to figure out if we have to workaround or not.

The issue here is that you are inserting the iframe into a hidden box:

  this._markupBox.setAttribute("hidden", true);
  this._markupBox.appendChild(this._markupFrame);

and thus the binding doesn't get applied. You could just collapse the box instead of hiding it, which shouldn't have this problem. But why do you need to recreate, hide and show this frame every time a page is loaded? That seems like a lot of unnecessary work.

Thanks for the suggestion Neil, I'm not able to reproduce the race when using collapsed.
I would imagine we create a new iframe to prevent any long living leak inside of such iframe,
but I just don't know anything about inspector code... Brian may confirm.
