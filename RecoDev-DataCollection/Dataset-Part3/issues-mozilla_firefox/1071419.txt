1. Load "Santa Is Coming" SWF demo from areweflashyet.com:
http://www.areweflashyet.com/shumway/iframe/viewer.html?swf=/ant-karlov/SantaIsComing.swf
2. Open Firefox's Web Console. The console shows many "Dropped tag during parsing. Code:" warnings while the game loads.
3. Click through the game's "Click to Continue" and "Play" menus.

RESULT:
On the "How To Play" screen, no buttons respond to mouse clicks and the console logs an endless stream of TypeErrors:

TypeError: container._enqueueFrameScripts is not a function shumway.player.js:36481

This is a regression, is it related to the changes in frame script execution?
Yes, this regressed after we landed the refactored frame navigation code. Problem is that we don't check the type of the advancable object we call _enqueueFrameScripts on. Will be fixed after https://github.com/mozilla/shumway/pull/1739 landed.
