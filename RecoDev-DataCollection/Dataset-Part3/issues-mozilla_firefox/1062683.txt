We won't be sending url strings from Firefox, but we'll still need to identify a tile as being enhanced. The server was noting enhanced tiles as submitted tiles that include both id and url, so we'll just send "" for the url.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Bug 1042214
[User impact if declined]: History tiles that get enhanced will send url data for both aurora (34) and beta (33) users. The only tiles being enhanced are all mozilla.org properties, so we would see urls of some mozilla sites if they are in the user's top sites. Our privacy policy allows for this data, but we don't need to collect it through Firefox anymore.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: Tests updated
[Risks and why]: Simple change that uses an empty string instead of actual url string.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none

Let's avoid collecting data that we don't need. Approved for beta and aurora. Please get this landed for beta2, which goes to build on Mon, Sep 8.

Assigning this to Cornel for an initial assessment and verification.
I consider this issue doesn't need manual testing so I'll mark it accordingly.

Ed, please correct me if I'm wrong and if you think it needs manual coverage.
