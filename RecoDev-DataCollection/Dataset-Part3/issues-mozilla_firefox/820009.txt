Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0 beta 5

The pages are rendered, except the table margins which are mostly missing (see attached screenshot). Could this issue be related to bug 760997?

Mihaela,

That PDF is drawing lines as images. This is a dup of bug 759172. (760997 is dealing with characters)
It would seem this bug is fixed in Nightly but not in Firefox 19.0b5. Could someone please find the first Nightly where this started working in case we can uplift the patch in time for Firefox 19's release?

Thanks Alice. I've asked for uplift in that bug.
Same problem here too. http://www.unishivaji.ac.in/exam/dnlds/DPFEtoBEMay2013_130313.pdf

Is this a problem with pdf creator?
