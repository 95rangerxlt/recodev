Patch v.1

After landing the updated throbber from bug 326817 and looking at it in a nightly, I noticed it looks much fainter than it should be. Loading chrome://global/skin/icons/loading_16.png looks fine though.

I took a look at the CSS, and noticed that we're actually showing the throbbers at 50% opacity. The entries have been in winstripe since browser.css was created, and gnomestripe carried them over. Not sure why they were originally added, but I'd guess it was a hack to make the throbber more subtle.

Pinstripe currently displays the images at full opacity.

The updated winstripe/gnomestripe throbbers were both designed and reviewed using HTML mockups (full opacity against different background), so they should be expected to look fine at full opacity. [And faint at 50% opacity, as is the case.]

Note to self: I also looked at the throbber CSS waiting to be updated by bug 428764, and verified those are already at full opacity.
