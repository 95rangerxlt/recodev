I don't anything about HiDPI. How does it work? Do we have special mediaqueries/classes to know when to use the right images?

@media (min-resolution: 2dppx) {
  .something {
    background-image: url("image@2x.png");
    background-size: |double|px;
  }
}
Also see bug 781327 for how it was done for the main browser UI.
Stephen, can you provide the icons for this? At least the tools' icons (in the tabs).
Created attachment 8339341
DevTools - Icons @2x - 01

These are all the icons from the osx and shared themes directories except the breadcrumbs.

I took the opportunity to clean up all the @1x icons as well so if you could please just do an image swap on those when adding the @2x versions.

Will follow-up with the breadcrumbs images.
For the breadcrumbs, can you just provide the arrow we see here: http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/mockups/devTools/ux-refresh-2013/DarkTheme-Inspector-Active@2x.png ?
Brian, can you take a look at this?
Bug 947309 uses 2x icons for the top toolbar.  The remaining icons that need to be converted to 2x (and moved into the shared folder) are: responsive mode, webconsole output, webconsole input prompt, inspector twisties and checkboxes, debugger breakpoint, debugger widget arrow, debugger icons (controls and blackboxing & breakpoints buttons), style editor sidebar arrow & eye, profiler icon.

I will take a look at these and see how many changes will be needed for each, and if they can be done all together here.
Can I fix the remaining images ? If so, should I file a new bug (since this might be for tracking) ?
Ok, so I'm gonna split this up in multiple small bugs, otherwise it's gonna be a mess.

Yes, let's file a separate bug (blocking this one) for each image / each logical group of images.

Yay! Thanks for all the patches ntim, looking sharp at 2x.
