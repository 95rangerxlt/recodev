The places that get picked out to update are based on visit_count or visit_date which can result in the same list of places that get updated if they fall into the same update bucket (i.e., get updated to -1 again and again or to its current frecency). This causes other places, e.g., those with invalid frecencies, to not get updated so nothing gets updated.

Randomly pick out places to update while preferring high visit_count places instead.
