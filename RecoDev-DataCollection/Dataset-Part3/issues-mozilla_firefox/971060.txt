This is the code that should handle connecting everything when the user clicks the "Translate" button. It should do the following:

 - Re-run the document walker module to get a fresh data structure (because the webpage content might have changed from the infobar offer to when the user decided to translate). (this time it doesn't need to run language detection)
 - Send the formatted string to the translation service
 - Switch infobar to display "translation in progress"
 - Receive translation result and send it to document walker module to re-parse data into tree
 - Switch webpage's text content with the translated content
 - Keep original text data around and be able to switch text content back to original
