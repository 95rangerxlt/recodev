That's an intentional crash following the previous line, which is the significant part: "application timed out after 330 seconds with no output." The test hangs, so we crash in the (usually vain) hope that the stack from the crash will tell you what was hung.

[in-fx-team] proposed fix

Proposed fix. Just open a tab and remove it, as in a usual mochitest. I believe the failure might be caused by a test harness bug.

I suggest disabling the test and go for try server runs, and see why it fails.

Will look into this more, tomorrow.

I disabled the test because it was practically perma-orange!

I don't see how this could have made a difference - a new tab in the opening window shouldn't affect anything. Isn't it more likely that your window load listener is running before the opened window's load listener, or something like that?

Not really, because the test runs fine. I believe it was a matter of focus. That assumption still holds true - I mean I still believe it's a problem of focus.

I talked to Tim Taubert on #fxteam and also believes the same. Between tests the test harness waits for focus on the main browser window and here the main browser window is never focused once the test ends (once the SourceEditor window is closed). This happens because (1) the SE window closes and the window manager picks the "running test" window instead of focusing the main browser window, and (2) my attempt to focus the main window fails because all code runs too fast.

Locally I was able to reproduce the problem under "special circumstances". The solution:
http://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=fb0045334099

... still waiting for results. What it does: it waits for the SE window to get focus, then run tests, then close, and properly focus the main window. This works locally.

Thoughts?
Results are green:

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/mihai.sucan@gmail.com-fb0045334099

... manually checked the logs, because the TBPL page is now broken - I don't know why.

(still, on Mac *many*/almost all devtools tests failed due to bug 679301)

[in-fx-team] another fix

Another attempt to fix the intermittent failures. This patch now enables the test.

This had green try results. http://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=fb0045334099

I don't really have a great sense that this is going to fix the problem. It feels like we're starting to get into circular patch cycles to try to make this work without really fixing the problem.

I'd like to understand what's actually causing this failure, but can give this patch a try. If it doesn't work, we'll need to try something more radical.

Thanks for the r+!

Patch landed:
http://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/75eeb6cb7050

If this still fails, then (1) Try server is not reliable :( and (2) we really need a more radical approach, as pointed out.

> If this still fails, then (1) Try server is not reliable :(

When writing a fix for an intermittent variable, it's often a good idea to run the affected test suite on your try server job multiple times (you can do that from TBPL.)  For example, if you're dealing with a test which fails 3 out of 5 times, running the Moth tests 20 times can give you a pretty good idea on whether the problem has been really fixed, or whether you're just being lucky on the first run.
