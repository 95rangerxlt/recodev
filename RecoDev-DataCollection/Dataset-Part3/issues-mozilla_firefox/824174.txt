Sorry for the delay I was waiting for bug 822100 to be reviewed.
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/70dc4af0325b
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/70dc4af0325b
It would appear that the fix for this bug fixed bug 820009 on Aurora and Nightly but still affects Firefox 19. Would it be possible to uplift this to Firefox 19 before go-to-build of our last Beta on Monday?
Anthony, several localized strings were changed in this patch and bug 817924 (which needs to be uplifted as well)

Neither of these have been nominated yet. Is the plan to nominate soon? I'm just concerned because time is running out and it would be a shame for this to go unfixed for 6 weeks if the changes are low risk.
