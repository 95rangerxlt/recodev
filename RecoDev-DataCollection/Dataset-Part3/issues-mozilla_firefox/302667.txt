Bug #297421 fixed the annoying problem of the focus rect appearing on newly
opened tabs and clicked tabs. However this did ally you to simply grab and drop
a tab to reorder it.

Now to reorder a tab you must click to open it and then reorder it. This is
harder and less discoverable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click and hold another (not-current) tab and drag
2. Nothing occurs
3. Click again and drag and it will reorder

Actual Results:  
Tabs do not reorder on first click

Expected Results:  
Allow single click and drag reordering

Confirming
perhaps tab switches should occur on mousedown, but the focus should only be
able to change on mouseclick

Aaron, we need help on this one. Can you? Mike, what about you? I think this is
definitely a blocker to our tab drag and drop story.
I just backed out the fix from bug 297421 locally and I don't see this problem
going away.  Something else is eating this it seems.  Taking to investigate.
ok, so my build was horked, we could regress that bug for tabbrowser only, or
make tabbrowser work onclick instead of onmousedown... I don't like those
options, but focus is a pain.

Mike, what do you think about my idea in comment 2.
Actually I think I have it wrong im comment 2.

It seems like the drag and drop code requires that the dragged tab be focused.
Is there a good reason for that?
In fact I debugged more and found that the ondrag* DOM events don't get fired at
all unless the tab has focus.

Ensure that PostHandleEvent for mousedown is called before the new tab is selected, so that the CSS doesn't yet say the tab is focusable
