The extension list currently uses icons from notifyBadges.png as emblems for the following cases:

- Extension is disabled because it is incompatible or causes other errors

- Update for the extension is available

Other states which had been used in FF3 have been disabled as far as I know, so we only need to provide tango versions of those two icons.

Actually now that we are going to use gtk-dialog-error also elsewhere in the UI, I think it would be great to use it here, also (for the first case).

Icon for case #2 will follow soon.

Uses pretty icons that make me do the tango

This uses the stock error icon for errors and that pretty orange star for updates.

This should be landed after bug 420569 since the line offsets in the diff are from after that patch is applied. (Shouldn't really matter, but just in case)

Also, when this lands, attachment 306264 should be added as toolkit/themes/gnomestripe/mozapps/extensions/notifyBadges.png

r=mano, pending ui-r.

Why would this need ui-r? None of the other Linux native stuff has required ui-r. ... or do you just mean on the icon itself?
For the icon itself, right.

Update available icon

faaborg, this icon ok?
in case it helps, that update icon is the same icon that at least all Ubuntu users see in the taskbar when an update is available. So as soon as this pops in, a large base of users will immediately recognize it as the update icon
It's not the same but it was knowingly done very similar to the existing icon in gnome-icon-theme (which is what you see in ubuntu for example) for this specific reason.

Update available icon

On other platforms we are planning on using a circle with an up arrow for this badge.  This will probably be green on XP and different shades of blue on Vista and OS X.  Ideally a 32x32 version of this badge would be used for the addons manager prefpane icon.

Yeah, that is a great example of the type of visual integration with the platform that we are hoping to achieve with this release.
