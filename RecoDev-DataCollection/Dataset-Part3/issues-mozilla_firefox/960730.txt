Thanks for the patch!  I've made a couple of notes.  Also, can you add ;r=bgrins at the end of the commit message?

You can move this logic into the existing DOMContentLoaded event instead of adding the onload

In this case, I would just use document.querySelector("#connection-form form") and get rid of the ID in the markup, since it is unlikely to move out of this element.

This patch looks like it was based off of the original patch you submitted, not against the latest code base.  Can you rebuild it against the latest code?  It may be that you added a new patch on the queue, instead of modifying the existing one - there are instructions on MDN about how to put two patches together: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_Queues#Folding_multiple_patches_into_one.  Feel free to ping me (bgrins) on IRC in #devtools if you need some help.

Looks like there is some trailing whitespace here
Okay.
Never worked with Mercurial before, thank you for the link.
