Approving for uplift to aurora and to beta (from discussion with Sylvestre). 

We want this to be in 38.0.5, but not in 38.0, since Reader Mode is disabled for 38.0 on Desktop.
As mentioned before, the Target Milestone tracks landing on m-c. Please make sure it's set correctly or it'll interfere with uplifts.
