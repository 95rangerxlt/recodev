Build ID: 20130313031041

Steps to reproduce:

1. Loaded up http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/tests/helvetial.html
2. Inspected either of the two spans in the second test line (#l02).


Actual results:

The Font inspector labeled the font as "remote" even though it is local, with no remote fallbacks; see attached screenshot.  Relevant CSS for the two spans in the second test line:

@font-face {
	font-family: "H";
	src: local(Helvetica);
	}
@font-face {
	font-family: "A";
	src: local(Arial);
	}
#l02 .s01 {font-family: H, monospace;}
#l02 .s02 {font-family: A, monospace;}



Expected results:

The font should have been labelled "system".

#l02 .s02 {font-family: A, monospace;}



Expected results:

The font should have been labelled "system".
It looks like the Font Inspector has two categories, "system" for fonts found directly via CSS font-family names (or via fallback, I assume), and "remote" for fonts defined via @font-face rules.

But @font-face rules can load either truly "remote" fonts (via src:url(...)) or "local" fonts (via src:local(...)). While the latter are the same fonts as might be used directly as "system" fonts, it's probably good to distinguish them, as using them via @font-face with src:local has a number of implications that can affect the behavior.

So I think the Font Inspector should probably have a three-way distinction between "system", "local" and "remote", or something like that. (I'm not really happy with "system" vs "local"... any better suggestions for terminology?)
