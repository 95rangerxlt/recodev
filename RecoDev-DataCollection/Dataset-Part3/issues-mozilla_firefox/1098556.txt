locbar.post.label has been removed, which makes sense since we now have checkboxes.
But then you left locbar.pre.label, and that definitely doesn't work.

Imagine this situation in English:

locbar.pre.label = Suggest
locbar.post.label = in the location bar when typing

See what happens when you remove just the .post part? Even if English remains the same, locbar.pre.label needs to be renamed to force localizers to check and eventually updated existing translations.

Thanks, we overlooked that due to the en-US translation structure
Marco, please add this to the current iteration
