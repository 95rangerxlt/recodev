Have about:home as the homepage for the browser

By placing some alert()'s in the code, I found that new windows are getting the 'resize' event before 'load', and that is what is causing document.body to be null.

Does |if (document.readyState != "complete")| work here?

Yeah, that's a better approach and works well.
Updated STR,

The open sidebar causes the resize before the document has loaded.

Works for me, although this isn't too surprising if this is a race condition.

Do you get the error in Firefox 16, aurora, beta, nightly or only in a custom build?
I can reproduce in a regular Nightly build with the social sidebar open.
What code opens the social side bar?

Anyway... I think a better fix would be to move window.addEventListener("resize", fitToWidth); inside the load listener.

Patch v2.1
To show the social sidebar, go to about:config and set social.active=true and social.enabled=true. You can then use the menu from the toolbar button to toggle the sidebar visibility.
(In reply to Jared Wein [:jaws] from comment #11)
I think DÃ£o was asking for the line(s) of code that perform that operation.
This is the call stack,
SocialSidebar_updateSidebar@chrome://browser/content/browser.js:4644
SocialSidebar_init@chrome://browser/content/browser.js:4605
SocialUI_providerReady@chrome://browser/content/browser.js:3977
chrome://browser/content/browser.js:4646

note that since browser.js was split into multiple files, much of this code will actually be found in browser-social.js.
