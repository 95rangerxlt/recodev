Crash reports
Thanks for your report.  I'm able to reproduce this on both Mac OS X 10.3.9
and 10.4.5.  It looks like it's caused by a bug (as yet unidentified) that I
introduced in JEP 0.9.5+b (since earlier versions aren't effected).

It also seems to be the same bug that was reported at
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329457#c9.

I'll be working on this.

By the way, you should always test with the most recent version of the Java
Embedding Plugin (currently 0.9.5+d) ... even though in this case it wouldn't
have made any difference.

I didn't notice this bug because I don't often use Apple's Java Console.
Here's an alternative way to view Java errors, which is what I actually use
most of the time (and which I prefer):

The JEP always writes Java errors to the ~/Library/Logs/Java Console.log file
(i.e. to the Java Console.log file in the Library/Logs/ directory under your
home directory).  You can use the Console utility (in Applications :
Utilities) to view changes to this file in real time, by doing the following:

Choose "Open" from the Console's "File" menu, then browse to
~/Library/Logs/Java Console.log and open it.

DAMN!!!  So this is why FireFox and Bon Echo crash everyday for me!
This really really sucks for a java developer on the Mac (not that I am doing much applet developing at this time, but will again in the future).

Please fix this ASAP!
I've just released a new version (0.9.5+e) of the Java Embedding
Plugin that fixes this bug:

http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/

Please follow the Readme's instructions to install the JEP to your
/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ folder, and to remove older copy(ies) of
the JEP from your Mozilla.org browser(s).

This bug should be FIXED, right?  (I can't find a "java console" to open anywhere to test.)
The "Java Console" is what you see when you choose "Show console" or
"Use Java console" in the "Java Control Panel" (e.g. Applications :
Utilities : Java : Java 1.4.2 Plugin Settings or Applications :
Utilities : Java : J2SE 5.0 : Java Preferences).

Yes, this is fixed.
