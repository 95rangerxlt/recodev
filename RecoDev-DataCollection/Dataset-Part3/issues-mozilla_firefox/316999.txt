On Red Hat and Ubuntu, if you set the default browser to Opera using the Gnome preferences, then start Firefox 1.5 it does not check if it is the default browser. 

If you open preferences and manually check if Firefox is the default browser nothing happens.

This appears to be Linux only.

I get the following error in the JS console when clicking the "Check Now" button:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.getService]"  nsresult: "0x80570016 (NS_ERROR_XPC_GS_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/preferences/general.js :: anonymous :: line 133"  data: no]

Could be related to / dupe of bug 297841.
Hmm, that matches up with http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/preferences/general.js#169 , which shouldn't be reached on platforms without the shell service, because of the ifdef, although I see browser.js uses a getShellService helper that fails gracefully, so maybe that ifdef isn't so useful.

This works fine on both of my own trunk and branch builds, but seems to fail when using tinderbox builds.

Are we missing some files that we need to include to get "GNOME integration"?

(Also, I get fancy GNOME icons on some buttons with my builds. Probably the same root cause...)
Is this a bug or a feature request? I don't remember ever seeing this work on Linux. What version(s) of Firefox does this work for on Linux now?
Assuming you mean the "set as default browser feature", it works in both my 1.8 and trunk builds that I've built locally, as well as in the Firefox package that Ubuntu included.

(Just to be clear, I CCed rhelmer and preed because I figured this was a build issue; e.g. tinderboxes not having the correct files we need to include to have this.)
And by "files" I mean certain GNOME library files, not that we're missing some files from the tree.

Yep, you're right, I just never noticed it (maybe it's because mozilla-shipped builds don't seem to do it)?

Thanks, I will check it out.
