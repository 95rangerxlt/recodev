In today's nightly (2012-12-10) the Click-to-play doorhanger is appearing on every page with flash after a page load or reload.
On this YT page e.g., it's ok like previously:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmuNApHFec

but not on this streaming site:
http://www.jango.com/music/Rihanna?l=0
Not sure if related, but this appeared today here:
- go to http://imgur.com/
- see the popup, click "never activate plugin for this site"
- reload
- popup appears again
We've discussed how to resolve this.

1) Let's do bug 820109 only once per browser session
2) Let's change the icon from the blue plugin to red blocked plugin in the awesomebar
3) Whenever the red blocked plugin icon is visible, let's animate it (fade out, fade in, fade out, fade in) 

Thanks for taking this on Jared!
We're targeting this for landing in tomorrow's beta, if at all possible.

These steps do not reproduce for me. May be the difference between enabling CTP manually and having a blocklisted Flash version. Please file a separate bug.

I'm in the middle of a clobber build so this patch is untested, but it *should* work as akeybl had described in the above comment.

Requesting review before I can test it so that I can get a quicker turn-around-time on it to land it in time for beta.

Is your saying to resolve fix showing doorhanger popup on many pages which is talked in bug 810082 ?

If it is so, I think fixing it sufficiency that we'll change to no showing popup when in normal CTP which is not blocking outdated plugins.
If we talk about the annoying behavior reported in bug 810082 comment #35, the root problem is that it's very annoying the showing doorhanger popup steals user focusing. We should fix it.

this._notificationDisplayed should not be configurated in this part. This part checks whether a scripted plugin is visible or not.

If we change this._notificationDisplayed to handle blocking VulnerablePlugin, I think we should refer this._notificationDisplayed in this.

It's confusing that this is packed as notifyPluginBlocked.png in winstripe and gnomestripe but pluginBlocked-16.png in pinstripe, while pinstripe also packages notifyPluginBlocked.png but uses it differently.

Good call, thanks.

Yeah, I tried to fix it in this revision by using the correct icon for notifyPluginBlocked.png on pinstripe as well as including the 16px version for pluginBlocked-16.png. Changing notifyPluginBlocked.png to use the 16px gets confusing because it looks to be used for notification bars and there doesn't appear to be an easy way to dynamically switch that icon for HiDPI (maybe navigator.platform.contains("Mac") && window.matchMedia("(min-resolution: 2dppx)")).

Isn't this a 16px icon? That is, if it existed (see below), wouldn't it be a 16px icon?

This won't break correctness, but is a nice optimization we can make. Can you file a follow-up to make this change?

I think these change are good at blocking outdated plugins automatically. These indicate more clear information to user.

However, at normal click-to-play, I feel this change (1) is not good.
A user using normal click-to-play are regarded as that they understand the feature of normal click-to-play, because it is an opt-in feature.
So showing the doorhanger popup per browser window might be very annoying for user who is used to use normal opt-in click-to-play.

This is happening once per window per session. I'm not sure why the animation doesn't happen each time. We should file a bug on it to investigate further.

We don't have a way to override blocklisted plugin warnings on a per-domain basis.

I filed bug 825035 for this.
I think before verifying this it would be better to wait for bug 825035, bug 809846 to be fixed and for feedback in bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=810082#c69 which is part of this.
Verified fixed FF 19, 20b1, 17.0.3 ESR.
Actually there is a problem here. I don't understand why the first time CTP notification is not displayed on Ubuntu on FF 20, 21, 22, but is displayed on FF 19, 17.0.3 ESR. On all other OSes works fine on all FFs. Tested on http://imgur.com/
