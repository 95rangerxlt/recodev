We need a better and more descriptive icon than the generic one we're using now, specially so it looks gorgeous in the AppManager list.

The icon needs to come in several sizes which keep changing with each version of Gaia, so the best solution is to provide both a vector icon source to be ready for the future sizes, and export several versions for nowadays requirements: 16x16, 48x48, 60x60, 128x128

For reference, this is the current placeholder icon we're using: https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-privileged-app-stub/blob/8cc763ec98c7425d992d1a030e5fa745fc45f181/img/icons/mortar-128.png
Fred, do you think we can get some designer resources for this?
Actually, Paul said Darrin would be the person for this.

Sole, are these alright?

Darrin, is that the final design?
I think they're cool! Thanks, Darrin!

But I'd like to have the vector sources too. 128px already looks pixelated in this retina machine.

EPS icons
(Sole: Please check the EPS Icons into the repo somewhere too, maybe into the main one so they are available but don't get packaged up with the templates)
Darrin, I don't have access to software that can handle EPS. Could you be super cool and nice and export the icons as SVG? That way I can not only open SVGs but also automate vector->bitmap resizing.

Thanks-a-lot-a-lot-a-lot :-)

SVG Icons.zip

Just for you Sole!
Thanks Darrin (picture an inline happy reaction gif here).

Fred, I think it's best to check only the SVG file into each template, in the img/icon folder. E.g.
https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-privileged-app-stub/tree/review-1/img/icons

It is a thing that can be interpreted by the browser after all. And maybe in the future Gaia will show SVG images in the homescreen, I've heard - imagine magnification effects and etc! :-)

Marking as resolved because we've got the files we needed.
