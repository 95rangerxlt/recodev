I can't tell, having closed the Bookmarks Menu item, that I have subfolders under it. This is made worse by the fact that just selecting the Bookmarks Menu item collapses it.

Brett, I think we should kill single click expand/collapse, and just go back to using twisties for all items. After using it this way for a few weeks, it feels really awkward compared to pretty much every other list view I've ever used ;-) 
Fixed. 
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
