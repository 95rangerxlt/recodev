There are several XUL markup problems that cause accessibility to be suboptimal for this new Firefox feature.

1. On the Permissions tab, the label for the "Permissions for" textbox has a typo that causes accessibility to fail.

2. On the Permissions tab, the various groupbox labels are not properly associated with the hbox'es and the radio groups, causing screen readers not to give proper contextual information.

3. On the Privacy and Security tab, under the Privacy section, the textboxes don't have associated labels, preventing screen readers from properly reading them in the proper context.

Patch fixing the problems described.

1. Fixing typo in control attribute for "Permissions for" textbox.
2. The vboxes that are used to group the checkboxex and radio groups together, have been turned into groupboxes accessibility-wise, and the labels now actually label both the corresponding groupbox and the radiogroup.
3. The description elements in the Privacy group have been turned into wrapping labels so accessibility is giving correct information.
