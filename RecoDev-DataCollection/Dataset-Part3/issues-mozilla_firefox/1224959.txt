User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0
Build ID: 20151030085317

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded to FF 42.
Open new tab on https://particuliers.societegenerale.fr/ (online banking)


Actual results:

The page loads correctly but after a few seconds it becomes greyed and the CPU goes up to 100% (the cpu fan becomes noisier).
I cannot use this site anymore from FF; with Chromium I can.
I have no problem with my usual other sites.


Expected results:

The page should have loaded as usual.

If you try Nightly 45, is the issue still present there?
Do you know where I can find a binary package for Ubuntu 12.04 ?

> Do you know where I can find a binary package for Ubuntu 12.04 ?

You should be able to download one from https://nightly.mozilla.org/.  It's not a PPA or anything like this, but it should work as a quick test at least.
I have downloaded it from your link: I have not the problem anymore.
Thank you.
Does this correction will be available in the next release ?
Great!  Without more investigation, it's hard to know exactly what fixed the issue.  So, it's at least fixed in 45.  The next version moving to release is 43 (currently in beta[1]).  Depending on when the fix was made, it could be part of anything from 43 to 45.

You can check the release calendar for more details[2].

Marking RESOLVED since it appears fixed in a more recent version.
