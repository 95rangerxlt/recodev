Will do.  I'm currently working on bug 260058, so merging the changes together
shouldn't be difficult.  For en-US I'm sure I can handle it.  For the other
languages, I'll take a look, but I might need to push that part over to
bsmedberg, depending on how opaque the l10n build process is.

Move Help locale files into locale/help within en-US.jar
Scuttlebutt is that localizers would like this...never hurts to have them on our
good side.  I've tested on Linux (both running from build location and from
installer), and everything seems hunky-dory.

-->blocking-aviary1.0?
This is WONTFIX for 1.0, we have decided that all localizations of firefox will
contain the en-US help files as a backup. On trunk, I'm open to suggestions,
ccing the localizers for input.
*** Bug 266421 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Now that l10n is stable on trunk, this is probably worth doing for 1.1.
1.5 or later
Fixed in bug 289555.  Locale files are now in AB_CD.jar, and the viewer itself
is packaged in toolkit.jar.
