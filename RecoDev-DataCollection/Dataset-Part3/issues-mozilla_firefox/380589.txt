If private data is cleared when no browser window is visible and Firefox is quit without reopening any browser window, the content of the last open browser window may be restored at restart.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Set browser.preferences.instantApply to true (default on OS X) and configure Firefox to show the windows and tabs from last time on startup
2. Tools -> Options -> Privacy
3. Close all browser windows (take note of the content of the last one)
4. Clear all private data through the still open Options window
5. Close the Options window and all others (resp. quit Firefox)
6. Start Firefox again

Expected result:
Firefox starts blank (as all potentially private data has been cleared).

Actual result:
The last opened window is restored (including related session cookies and recently closed tabs).

one-line fix (and two typos)

One-line omission: data for the last closed window isn't cleared on CPD.

Additionally, this fixes two further nits:
* a comment talking about five seconds when the code obviously says ten
* a variable prefixed as argument when it's not

P.S.: Dietrich, care to reconsider the patch to bug 367605?

thanks, r=me.
Drivers: Do you want this for Firefox 2.0 as well? As you can see in comment #0, it's highly unlikely to be reproduced in the wild. OTOH it's a privacy issue...

Not a blocker for the branch, but ask for approval on the patch and we'll consider it.

Trivial, virtually riskless one-liner: just resetting a variable to its initial value.
