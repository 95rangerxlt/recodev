Document the stuff to be added for bug 172962 (which would also seem to fix bug
227241, which somehow got absorbed into it in terms of the possible patch).  For
now, as no actual UI exists, what will happen will be something like this in
prefs.xhtml:

<!--h2>Tabbed Browsing</h2>

<p>Blah blah blah new prefs docs...</p-->

...and in the index and ToC:

<!--rdf:li the-proper-attributes="the-proper-values"/-->

Thus, they'll be shut off from actual display but will still be present for
localizer use.

Adds descriptive text - text needs work

Steffen, what do you see that's wrong with the wording this patch would
introduce?  It's definitely junky, but right now I'm having trouble coming up
with something better.

Pinging Steffen so he'll see this when he gets back...
I'm working on this and hope to have it finished soon.  As Help is an optional
component for localizations, however, this may or may not be a blocker.  It's
still worth clarifying.
not a blocker but we'd take reviewed patches.

Browsing absorbs Multimedia? And looses a few prefs to Tabbed Browsing?
Bug 172962 doesn't do that. Attachment 158455 introcuces a new Tabbed Browsing
section, which only contains the new prefs. Is there another bug to reorganize
the prefs?

The default option of the pref "browser.openlink.external" is 1, see attachment
158459, which is "&recentWindowOrTab.label;", which displays "the most recent
tab/window". So that's the default, not opening in a new window.

I'm confused. I think the links request to be opened in a new *window* (they
know nothing about tabs). So Firefox does right that: open a new window. If I
read attachment 158459 correctly, that will still be the default.

Exactly. But can we make "when it is enabled" more active? I mean it's the user
who has do enable it. Something better than "enable this option and select the
appropriate choice"?

See the just-posted bug 172962 comment 84 (or more correctly, the eventual
response).

> It's Windows only, see bug 172962 comment 82.

Done after I posted the patch here, but of course still a problem.

Also done after I posted -- I assumed the current behavior would stay the
default behavior.

This looks like me being stupid (or at the least slightly befuddled).

That sounds like a good idea to me; I'll do something like that after I get a
response to the previously-mentioned comment.

This is now on hold until unresolved issues in prefs UI possibilities are fixed.
The patch in bug 172962 has been updated.

We also need to document the new "Select new tabs opened from bookmarks or
history" pref, which was introduced by bug 251770 a few days ago. Probably too
late for 1.0PR, so let's do it in this bug.
The patches for bug 172962 have been checked in. Check it out :)

The prefs this describes are all completely cross-platform now, right?  I'm
going to (have to) get to this tonight, and I'll likely be editing the previous
patch so that it's fully correct.  Steffen, if you're online tonight any time,
send an email with times so that I can get something done before then so you can
look at it quickly.  This is coming down to the wire, but real life is
interfering right now enough that I really can't spare a whole lot of extraneous
time beyond that required to update the patch.

It'll be nice once Help's frozen; it's one less deadline in my life.

Pinging Steffen, hoping he's still around...if not, I'll be checking this in
for 1.0 anyways, because its absence is a big problem with prefs documentation.

The last sentence is wrong. And we shouldn't use the word "select" because
that's what we want to explain. I prefer the explanation above, with background
and foreground tab. Can't we just say something like "same as above, but for
tabs opened from bookmarks or history"?
Fixed branch and trunk with this text for "select from bookmarks":
