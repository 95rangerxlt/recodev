When blocking a third party image on a web site, the web site's host name is displayed instead of the third party host name.

One example I see is on news8.net.  Some of the images are from wjla.com.  And others are from an ip address.  Blocking either of these will give the notification that images are blocked from news8.net.  Which that is not the case. 

Actual:
When blocking a third party image the host name of the web site is shown.

Expected:
When blocking a third party image show the host name of the third party server.

The context menu correctly shows the third party host name.  e.g. Block Images from wjla.com.

This is possibly worse than when the message was ambiguous (Bug 346728).  Then you could assume the site being blocked was the one you meant.  Now the notification could be explicitly wrong because it's blocking one site while saying it's blocking another.  
The patch for bug 346486 was wrong: not only does it redeclare "uri", it changes it to the host of the page when it's already the URI being blocked.
I can have this done tomorrow.  If someone wants to take it before then, feel free.
