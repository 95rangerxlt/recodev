neither safari nor opera mimic this behaviour.

Note that the xlink:type thing is probably unnecessary and that this list would need to be expanded when we fix the mathml linking bug.  Or something.

In the C++ code, can we just QI to Link (at least once Shawn lands) instead of all the hardcoding?
I thought mathml links were just xmlns:type="simple". Is the mathml linking bug 427990?

Erm. Once Shawn lands what?
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chapter7.html#sec7.1.5 was what I was looking at.
> I thought mathml links were just xmlns:type="simple".

They are, but not all xlink:type="simple" things are links.

The Mathml linking bug is indeed bug 427990.

Shawn is hopefully going to land bug 461199 and appurtenances thereunto today.

remove link type code per bz comment

We can put a note in bug 427990 about changing this code when writing a patch for that.

If bug 461199 lands I can rework the C++ code, if not I can raise a follow up and fix it once it does.

I don't think the HTMLLinkElement line makes sense. <link> is always empty and only permitted in <head>, as far as I know... hence no way to invoke a tooltip.

You'll need somebody else to review the embedding/ part.

I can either make the change so it looks like this once bug 461199 lands or alternatively ask Shawn to include this change when he lands bug 461199. Assuming it's right of course.
> <link> is always empty

Not necessarily.

> hence no way to invoke a tooltip.

Would you like a testcase that makes an <html:link> not only hoverable but also clickable as a link?

The updated patches look ok to me except for the <link> issue and the fact that they will treat some things as links that aren't actually links (cases where the href attribute is set but can't be used to create an nsIURI).  Not sure there's much you can do about the latter, but please fix the <link> thing.

You want to check @href for <link> as well, probably.  sr=me with that.

A testcase would be interesting, since my reading of the html spec seemed to support my naive understanding.

clickable <link>s

> A testcase would be interesting

Here you go.  Note that the <link>s are visible in webkit and opera too, but they don't make them into actual clickable links.  We do.  If we stop doing that, we can stop treating them as links here too...

Also note that I could have used kids appended to the <link>s via the DOM or an XML testcase instead of CSS generated content.
Comment 16 fixed the bug, although I still need to land the follow up once bug 461199 lands.
The follow up to use mozilla::dom::Link breaks non-libxul builds.

            nsCOMPtr<mozilla::dom::Link> linkContent(do_QueryInterface(currElement));
            if (linkContent) {
              nsCOMPtr<nsIURI> uri(linkContent->GetURI());

results in the linker complaining that GetURI can't be found. I don't know what to do about that since adding 

SHARED_LIBRARY_LIBS = \
		$(DEPTH)/content/base/src/$(LIB_PREFIX)gkconbase_s.$(LIB_SUFFIX) \
		$(NULL)

to the Makefile results in 1 link error becoming 238 link errors from the dependent libraries that gkconbase_s requires.
Hmm.  Shawn, can we expose the URI via some sort of virtual method (possibly in addition to GetURI) so this can work?

There should be some way to make linking work here, shouldn't we?  If push comes to shove, we can always add some new interface I guess.
The ways to make that linking work are to either inline the method, make the two things part of the same library, make it virtual (or add a GetURIExternal method that's virtual), or change visibility so it's globally exposed from the module...  Usually in this situation we add a virtual *External method.
Why don't we just change the visibility then since that seems simplest:
NS_EXTERNAL_VIS(already_AddRefed<nsIURI>) GetURI() const;
If that makes things link on all platforms, I'm ok with that, I think.
Ideally NS_EXTERNAL_VIS would only be applied in dynamic builds.

> Ideally NS_EXTERNAL_VIS would only be applied in dynamic builds.
Yeah, maybe we could make a new define for that?

I can't get NS_EXTERNAL_VIS to link. virtual works a treat though.
