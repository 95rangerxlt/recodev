There appears to be an isolated bug in Firebird where any attempt to access any page times out.  I 
get connections established with the websites with `netstat -a`.  I have a direct connection to the 
internet and browsing works normally from Safari, IE, or Camino.  The same problem is 
reproducible from Mozilla 1.5.  DNS is functioning, there is no firewall enabled.  No proxies are 
present.

My system is a stock 10.2.8 install, and I've erased all mozilla / firebird / phoenix / camino library 
folders multiple times to isolate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start up firebird and wait for it to access its default startup page, www.mozilla.org
Actual Results:  
"The operation timed out when attempting to contact www.mozilla.org"

Expected Results:  
loaded the web page as IE, Safari

That's really odd. I wonder what's different about your set-up compared to
everyone else's. Have you tried (temporarily) emptying your Internet Plug-Ins
folders (one in your home library and one in the system library)?
I did some more sleuthing, and it appears that at home I am indeed behind a
proxy -- a transparent proxy running squid.  If you're not familiar with squid,
it can be set up to run transparently -- even though no proxy is configured, all
http traffic is routed through it.

So, it would appear that firebird may have a problem with running through
transparent proxy/cache systems, at least squid.  I'll contact my ISP to affirm
that they've configured transparent proxy/cacheing correctly.

On the other hand, it works fine with transparent proxying with all of the other
browsers, and it works fine with mozilla/firebird on win32.  I will post more
details as I find them out.
Changing summary to reflect new findings
It's been a while. Reporter, are you still having problems with recent builds of
Firefox and your Squid proxy? Same with the standard Mozilla browser?
Whatever it was, the problem ceased to exist when I started using mozilla 1.6a, and I haven't seen the 
bug since.  I'm closing this one as 'fixed', though 'worksforme' may be more appropriate.  keep up the 
good work.
I guess someone fixed it quietly. THanks :)
