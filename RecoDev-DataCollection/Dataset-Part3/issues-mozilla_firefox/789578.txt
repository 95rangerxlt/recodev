See.. No arrows

The arrows or triangles are not visible on Windows, clicking on the opening bracket of a tag sometimes does the job for me.

Optimizer, can you try to figure out why there's no arrow?
My guess is a missing -moz-appearance:none or maybe we forgot to add the icon for windows (as a file, or in the jar.mn).

Icon is there, but no -moz-appearance: none
Looking at the code, we use -moz-appearance: treetwisty (not the builtin twisty, like in the Rule View). So it should be okâ€¦

Optimizer, could you look at the style of the twisty (.expander) via DOM Inspector and see what is the moz-appearance value? (sorry, I can't do that myself, my windows box is dead).
You might look at the old html panel's twisties on windows:

Well.. This does not look good on dark theme. Although it is going to be backed out soon and replaced with a lighter.

I am also thinking of adding a slight padding on top to centrally align it.

Adding back the arrows

The screenshot for this patch is exactly as attachment 659805 except for the fact that the arrows are vertically aligned with "<"

Adding back the arrows

Instead of adjusting top, can you adjust the height?
Maybe .expander should be an inline-block (to have the same line-height as the following text).

No need to ask me for ui-reviews.

Height fix instead of top fix

Addressed comments.

inline-block messed up things, so did not use. Finally had to go with height = 24px
Why do you need `!important` ?
I don't know, it was there in the htmlpanel.css in the .twisty class implementation too.
