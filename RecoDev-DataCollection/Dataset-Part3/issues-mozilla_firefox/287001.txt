If you open up page http://happysin.net/arshappy.php in the sidebar, right-click
Copy/Cut/Paste do not work.  keyboard shortcuts do, just not the right-click
menu.  The options are not greyed out, they just don't do anything when you
click them.

This bug is not exclusive to the page, anything with a text box opened in the
sidebar will do this.

This does NOT happen in the newest nighly of Mozilla, but it does for Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open http://happysin.net/arshappy.php in the sidebar.
2.Type some text in a box and highlight it.
3.Right-click like you were planning to Copy/Cut/Paste.
4.Go try to paste the text you supposedly just copied.
Actual Results:  
What was pasted somewhere else was the previous item I had copied. 

Expected Results:  
It should have pasted the text I copied from the textbox in the sidebar.

Last tried with the 3/20 nightly build, originally discovered with the 1.0.1
release build.

I have no problem for this case.
I see this in 1.0 through 1.5.0.2 on windows. Install <http://bclary.com/projects/sidebars/> in a sidebar, choose any of the sidebars and try to right click paste some text into a text input. It won't work, but if you do a Ctrl-V it does work.
I can reproduce it in Firefox 1.5.0.6, 1.5.0.7 and 2.0 RC1.
It's not a serious bug but can be very annoying for basic user who can't use the keyboard shortcuts, and trust me, there are many of them!
It's still present in Firefox 2.0 as I expected.
I have the impression it's not difficult to fix, and I'm a programmer, but maybe I would need a hint... which source files should I look in?
This will likely be fixed, or by made easier to fix, in bug 356590.
Fixed on trunk by bug 356590.
