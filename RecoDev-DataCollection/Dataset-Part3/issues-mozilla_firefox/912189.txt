Currently, we have great autocompletion of CSS values in the rule view of the inspector.

However, it requires that you first enter a character, and then shows values starting with that character.

We should be able to show *all* possible values for a given property right when you tab to / click an empty value input.  This is a big help if you can't remember the possible values for the property.

Currently, we anyways truncate the number of entries in the suggestion list to 10. so *all* will as of now only mean the top 10 lexical entries.

This scenario will improve after bug 896969 is experimented upon.

This patch fixes the issue in inplace-editor, so both rule view and markup view work.

To see it in action:
 - add a new attribute in markup view to any node and type "style='color:" now as soon as you press : , you should get a list of suggestions.
 - Add a new "color" property in rule view and hit TAB. In this case, the suggestions list will appear, but nothing will be entered or selected, as rule view is live, while markup view is not. We don't want to have unintentional (by user) styles applied.
