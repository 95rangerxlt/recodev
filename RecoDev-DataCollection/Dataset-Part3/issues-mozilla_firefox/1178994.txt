STR:
1. Start a fresh Firefox profile on Linux.
2. Open "Customize" from hamburger menu.
3. Move the Pocket icon to "Additional Tools and Features" (i.e., the unused area).

ER:
The icon for Pocket disappears when it's in the Additional area.

AR:
There should be an icon for Pocket.

Maybe we're missing some assets on Linux or something?

Bill, are you running Linux in HiDPI mode (dppx > 1)?

The Pocket icon exists in the 1dppx sprite but is missing from our 2dppx sprite, so that's the only way I can see this happening.
Yes, I am running in HiDPI.
Thanks, the attached patch will fix the issue then.
We will need to uplift this to aurora40, and beta39 once the HiDPI images get uplifted there too.

Thanks for the correction. Yes, we will need to uplift this to aurora41, and eventually beta40 once the HiDPI images are uplifted to beta40.
