When there are signed mar checks across all major platforms (bug 903126) we should disable via preference the certificate attribute checks and the certificate built-in check. I've discussed this with dveditz and he is ok with this.

We already have signed mar checks on Windows so I filed bug 928489 to get the checks removed only on Windows and this bug will be for the remaining platforms after bug 903126 is fixed.
Bug 928489 is the new bug for Windows only

Patch - disable app update xml cert checks on Windows

Missed a change
Yep looks like we default to true:

Also could you include metro.js with the same change?
Already done
It's unlikely that I will get to work on this in the next two weeks, so unassigning myself for now.
