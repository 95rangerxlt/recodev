Now that we use a package manifest on all platforms, there's no need for Firefox to specify NO_PKG_FILES, to say that files which will never be copied out of dist/bin because they aren't in the manifest should be removed after they were copied except they can't be removed since they aren't there because they weren't copied.

FYI I plan[ned] to look into the package-compare to enhance the NO_PKG_FILES to not warn about missing files if its listed in that var.  Though me looking into that should not block this, imo; if this in itself is a good idea.
