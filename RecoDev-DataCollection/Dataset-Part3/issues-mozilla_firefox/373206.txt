when searching in bookmarks, if clear the quick search, we don't reset the search

to reproduce:

1) open the organize bookmarks dialog
2) type in "g", get the results that match "g"
3) backspace or delete "g"

expected results:  search results cleared

actual results:  "g" search results remain.

here's the problem:

in http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/places/content/places.xul#318 we are doing:

316       <textbox id="searchFilter" style="width: 23em;" timeout="500"
317                oncommand="PlacesSearchBox.search(this.value);" 
318                onreset="PlacesOrganizer.onPlaceSelected(false); return true;" 
319                collection="all">

onreset is never getting called, but that might be because the onblur handler was removed, and that used to call:

+      <method name="onBlur">
+        <body><![CDATA[ 
+        if (this.hasAttribute("empty") || !this.value)
+          this.reset();
+        ]]></body>

investigating...

sorry, ignore the onblur mumbo jumbo.

I suspect it is this:

 340   search: function PSB_search(filterString) {
 341     // Do not search for "" since it will match all history. Assume if the user
 342     // deleted everything that they want to type something else and don't 
 343     // update the view.
 344     if (filterString == "" || this.searchFilter.hasAttribute("empty")) 
 345       return;
mano tells me that joey has beat me to the punch here in another patch.
he does, and it fixes it, see bug #373211
fixed as part of bug #373211

thanks joey!
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
