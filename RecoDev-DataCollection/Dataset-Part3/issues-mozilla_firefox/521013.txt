This appears to happen on Mac OS X only. When animating the height of objects on a page, if the scrollbar is right at the bottom and the contents of the page shrink the whole page jitters.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto supplied URL
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click an image to open up that section
3. Now click on a section on the same line, as the first section closes, the page jitters
Actual Results:  
Page jitter, this is reproducible with other similar code, not just on this site

Expected Results:  
As the page content shrinks the scrollbar and content should resize smoothly with the animation as it does in Windows.

I can't reproduce this in a current trunk nightly, so it might already be fixed. Do you see the problem in this build?

No, it looks like it has been fixed in the latest pre release.
Thanks
