This is a regression between 1.9a1_2006012517 and 1.9a1_2006012609.
I don't see it in branch.
Weird, it's just toggling .disabled.
Removing the <stack> in cookies.xul should make it work again.
Hmm, why does removing the stack help? Just removing backgroundBox seemed to fix it well enough (backgroundBox is styled to be opacity: 0.5), but got rid of the nice gray background. Seems like the opacity stuff was just broken before and this dialog relied on that?

(I also noticed that the backgroundBox isn't styled on the Mac, not sure if that's intentional or not)
The stack needs a mousethrough="always", then it's working again like desired.
But it seems to me that the stack and the backgroundBox can just be removed and then move the styles from the backgroundBox to the grid. I think that should work just fine.

patch

Thanks for the help Martijn. I made the changes you suggested, and also removed the labels from the array of items to be disabled since I don't think it really makes sense to disable the labels themselves.
(this bug isn't present on the branch, but I think this cleanup should be applied there too)
