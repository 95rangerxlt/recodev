When opening many tabs 2.0 Alpha 2 changes the tab close button to be the current tab only. The problem is that this switchover starts for me when I open 8 tabs, but doesn't change back to all tabs until 6 tabs. The behavior should be consistent, it should switch to currently selected tabs at 8 and all tabs at 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 7 tabs. Note that tab close buttons are on every tab.
2. Open 1 more tab. Note that tab close button is only on currently selected tab.
3. Close 1 tab. Note that tab close button is still only on currently selected tab, despite now having the same number of tabs as in step 1.
4. Close 1 more tab. Note that tab close buttons are now on every tab.
Actual Results:  
The point at which the close button is on every tab varies. Before opening 8 it is 7, after it is 6.

Expected Results:  
The point at which the close button is on every tab should always be the same. If I open 8 tabs it should make the switchover at 8 and go back at 7.

I quote specific numbers of tabs here, but it is very possible this varies based on screen size/resolution. When reproducing try seeing where this hand off occurs for you, instead of taking my numbers as gospel.

I see that, too, but only if the selected tab is not the first.
This might be fixed by bug 337514.

That's an easy one to try out, but no, it does not fix it.

Thanks for testing.

For 2.0 Alpha 2 it occurs regardless of which tab is selected.
Just downloaded the latest trunk nightly and got the same behavior.

I don't think this is worth blocking on - it's a nice polish thing to get right, though, so if we get a small, safe, baked patch please nominate for approval1.8.1
My patch for bug 343585 is going to fix this, i think.
Fixed in bug 343585.
