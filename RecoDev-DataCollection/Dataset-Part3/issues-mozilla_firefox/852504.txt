Steps to reproduce:

This is a response to this bug being fixed:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=843342

I generated a basic automatic printed PDF file using TCPDF.  This is the key code
$js = 'print(true);';
$pdf->IncludeJS($js);
$pdf->Output($pdffile, 'F');

This code is described in this example:  http://www.tcpdf.org/examples/example_053.pdf

I then loaded it into Firefox 20 beta 5 which had the fix for the automatic print bug above.


Actual results:

The PDF loaded normally.


Expected results:

The print dialog box should have popped up the moment that the PDF file loaded.

PHP code that generates the PDF file using TCPDF

The attached PDF file generated from this code opens the auto print box in every browser and PDF reader I've tried (Safari/IE7/IE8/IE9/Chrome/PDF Reader/PDFViewer/Nitro PDF) except Firefox 20 beta 5 (and FF19 of course).

Please fix ASAP.  I've tried variations of the print(true) javascript because I know a text string search is what is used to bring up the print dialog and found none that works.  However, since this is the common method described in tutorials, it should be fixed in FF20 final, and I trust the fix would be pretty trivial.
I tried the github version and it works perfectly.  Thanks!
