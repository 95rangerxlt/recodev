The osx/Toolbar.png change in bug 888601 made it to Holly but shouldn't have. Lion and higher are fine since Toolbar-Lion.png is still used on Holly. I tried to verify that this was the only image in browser/themes which wasn't reverted properly for Holly but I'm not 100% sure that I did it properly because of the many merges and many tools aren't good at handling binary files.

Marking as P1 so Holly is ready in case we decide to use it.

Ugh. Thanks for noticing this. Still not sure how this didn't show up as a conflict when merging. :-\
