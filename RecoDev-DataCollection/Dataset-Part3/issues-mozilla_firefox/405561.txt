Use gnome-vfs meta header

nsGnomeVFSService.cpp now includes libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-utils.h, which is not in config/system-headers. In the spirit of bug #400621, I've attached a patch to make the code just use the meta header instead.

Without the patch, the build fails with gcc 4.2, just like bug #400621.

I tried the patch with gcc 4.2.1.
It solved build error.
Thanks!
