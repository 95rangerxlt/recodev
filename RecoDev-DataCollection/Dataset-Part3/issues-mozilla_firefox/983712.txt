What this change actually does:
Using flex box means we can better control the layout of the menu. It was a table, but is now a flexbox containing 2 divs, one for the names and one for the descriptions.
Also we fixed some mouse selection problems.

It's also https://github.com/mozilla/gcli/pull/18 although I'm not sure that helps as this is a single commit.

Does this need tests?
