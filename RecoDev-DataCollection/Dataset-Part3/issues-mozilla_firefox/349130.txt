Hovering over an active tab calls grab cursor but hovering over an inactive tab calls the default pointer. I have no idea if this is intentional and I see no problems (it even looks funny), except that it is inconsistent and that you don't always want to drag the tab when you hover over it.

If it is a regression, it regressed between 1.8.1b1_2006081613 and 1.8.1b1_2006081704:

It was intentional, but only as a "test". I think it's going to be removed.
Gavin, I think the grab cursor is a great idea to show that the tab is drag able. It helps a lot with discoverbility of that great feature. I think i should also be shown on inactive tabs but only after a few seconds to show that the tab isn't active and can be clicked, then after a few seconds show the drag cursor to show that the tab can be drug.
What about using the grab cursor only for the tabs' favicons? This would mirror the cursor's behavior with the address bar's favicon and would make tab d&d slightly more discoverable while not being as confusing as the current behavior.
If the hand grabber is to be kept then the mouse-down gesture should be changed to 'grabbed' state (close fingers) instead of the 'can be grabbed' state. That'll be more complete.

Besides, since the Tab can technically be dragged only when it is in focus, I don't see a reason to provide the grab gesture on background tabs, since practically a user will have to first bring it into focus and then drag it.

TMP has an option whereby the user can select to bring a tab into focus only on 'mouse click and release'... and hence a background tab can be selected through mousedown and then dragged without bringing it into focus (since there is no mouse-release here). That ofcourse is an entirely different scenario.

Background tabs can be dragged so it would be consistent to show the same cursor. It's a bit weird to see the cursor change on mousedown.
Would be a good idea to show the grab cursor only on the favicon, just what Simon said.

That would be really confusing, because you don't have to grab the icon to D&D a tab -- contrary to the address bar.

I like it as it is. I also second comment 4: It is kind of consistent to show the grab cursor for the focused tab only. FWIW, on all tabs it would look excessive.
--> blocking for final for a decision one way or another; not a regression, this is an intentional change to make it clearer that you can drag a tab.
Agreed; the hand icon is the wrong thing to be using here. The regular mouse pointer is used throughout all modern OSes and applications for both selection (click) and movement (click-drag) actions.

(note: the hand meant this in some drawing apps a while back, but that seems to have passed recently, and now the hand seems to mean "grab the underlying sheet and move it about" where all objects on that sheet move as the sheet moves; according to that metaphor, the hand should scroll the set of visible tabs in the tabstrip, not move a tab in relation to other tabs)
should be two one-line fixes, look for -moz-grab!

I've fixed this in both winstripe and pinstripe.

r+a=me on this branch-only theme change
fixed on the branch.

note, this was never an issue with the trunk, so marking fixed.
