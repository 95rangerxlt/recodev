Update verification config changes for 2003

You'll want to remove the "from" and "to" for the previous (2.0.0.1) release, or else it'll take much longer.

Update verification config changes for 2003, take II
One of the lines in Windows looks like:

release="2.0.0.3" ... build_id="2007021917" etc..

Should it not be:

release="2.0.0.2" ... etc..

Good catch juanb.. should be "release=2.0.0.2" above (since it is used to build the AUS2 path).

Good point.

I'll get it right one of these days. Maybe even before the release!

build ids look ok to me, but the locales don't match up with <http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/locales/shipped-locales> from whaqt I can tell... I don't know if that is meaningfull.
Locales don't match what is in http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html either.
Referring to comment #12, the locales that are missing in the script (different from ship locales) are:

af, be, he, ka, ku, pa-IN

Matching things with shipped-locales would be nice.
