Anybody want to attach a simple patch to fix this?
I don't think there's a 2px line; it's probably a 1px line which shouldn't be here, and since it's right against the bottom border of the list, you see 2px. I didn't see the bug, I'll recompile latest trunk to see if I see it.
This is a regression from bug 403140

This removes the splitter instead of replacing it with a non collapsable splitter. Then the infoPane top border touches the treeview bottom border.
Note that this isn't just cosmetic, the infoPane no longer can be resized, and automatically adapts its height to its content. Since it has been decided in bug 403140 that it would be the way to go, I'd just remove the threedshadow top border of the infoPane...

What do you think ?

 Remove the infoPane top border, it is unneeded and ugly since bug 403140 checkin
