User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20121231071231

Steps to reproduce:

I found the bug when upgrading to the latest Firefox 18 Beta Candidate from the latest Firefox 17 release. At some point in the past, I had used 'Customise Toolbar' to remove the 'Stop' and 'Refresh' buttons from my Awesomebar Toolbar. 



Actual results:

When entering text into the Awesomebar, it grew in height and caused the page to reflow due to the window chrome increasing in size. I believe this is due to the 'Go' arrow/icon not maintaining a fixed height when text is entered. See attached file for reference.

To reproduce:

1. Create Fresh Firefox Profile
2. about:config -> browser.tabs.onTop
3. Open Context Menu on Awesomebar Toolbar
4. Click 'Customise...'
5. Check 'Use Small Icons'
6. Drag 'Stop' and 'Refresh' buttons off Awesomebar Toolbar
7. Enter Text into Awesomebar - it should grow in height

Restoring the icons resolved the issue.


Expected results:

The Awesomebar Height should remain fixed, the chrome size should not increase and affect the size of the main pane. The 'Go' arrow in the Awesomebar should not grow.

I'm not able to reproduce the issue with Firefox 20 on Win 7 and a new profile.

Is it maybe OS-dependant?
I wasn't able to reproduce this issue either, with MacOS X 10.8.2 and Firefox 18 (the current Firefox Beta).
Hmm. I've just reproduced it again - are either of you using HiDPI displays per chance?
Full HD in my case with resolution at 125% (Win 7).
Bug reproduces on my 15" retina MBP.  The analysis of the "go" arrow seems correct - the bookmark star is replaced by an arrow which is too large to fit in the bar.  See animated gif, attached.

*** Bug 842129 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Oh, I was just reading the title of the bug I duped. I can repro this on Nightly after removing the stop/reload buttons.

Given that this has existed for a while and will be fixed by Australis, calling it wontfix. (Although if someone came by with a small patch, I'd actually take it.)
I could never replicate in the dupe because it was missing the "remove Stop and Refresh" instructions.

It looks to me like the arrow image is missing its width/height attributes. I've seen this exact thing happen before in lots of other HiDPI bugs.
For anyone reading along at home, Australis will be released as part of Firefox 25: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Features/Theme_Refinement_and_Evolution_%28Australis%29
*** Bug 907992 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Before bug 907992 was duped, I already wrote a patch. I just tested it. Let's just fix this, also to prevent problems for people switching between Australis and Nightly (even if that might take more work still...)

Patch

I'm not really decided whether this should be its own selector just for the go-button or if I can just shove it into this one. Either worked fine in my testing for both combined and non-combined stop/reload buttons.

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/25f0a3b012ff
Note: when merging m-c to UX, hg decided this now needed to go in the block that no longer had the #go-button selector (as it's gone). I decided otherwise and explicitly removed it.
