v1

A few global consts had to be changed slightly to achieve approximately the same animation timings.

Fixed a few fails in try.

-const INTRO_TRANSITION_DURATION = 50;
-const OUTRO_TRANSITION_DURATION = 40;
+const INTRO_TRANSITION_DURATION = 1000;
+const OUTRO_TRANSITION_DURATION = 800;
 const INITIAL_Z_TRANSLATION = 400;
 const MOVE_INTO_VIEW_ACCURACY = 50;
 
what are these units? Comments please.

 const MOUSE_CLICK_THRESHOLD = 10;
-const MOUSE_INTRO_DELAY = 10;
+const MOUSE_INTRO_DELAY = 200;
 const ARCBALL_SENSITIVITY = 0.5;

these too.

Otherwise looks really solid. Could you throw this through try as well? R+ with a successful run. Thanks!

I can't really relate these to a unit of measurement. Just interpolation magic numbers. Definitely not pixels, not centimeters, or kilograms...

I was thinking fractions of a second, frames or intervals. "Interpolation magic" is kind of unsatisfying.
