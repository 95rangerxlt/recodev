This is not a Yahoo mail problem, for it does not occur when using Internet Explorer.  When composing a new message using a pasted text from another message, the draft displays correctly, but after the message has been sent, when read in the SENT mailbox or the cc. to sender, the patch will display only one word per line.  The Yahoo mail version is the latest one (mimics Outlook format).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Yahoo Mail, compose a new message. From another message, copy and paste some text into the new one.  Send the message, with a cc. to yourself.
2. Read the copy sent to you, or saved in the SENT mailbox.
Actual Results:  
Any passage copied from another message and pasted into the new one will display as one word per line.

Expected Results:  
Message should have read with normal line length.

There is a very awkward workaround:  If the text to be pasted in is first copied and pasted into a WORD document, and then that document is copied and pasted into the new message, the result will be normal line-lengths.

Doug,

Are you still seeing this?

I noticed another problem, very similar, but possibly not the same: I have my Yahoo Mail set to use the ">" prefix quote style, and I got the one-word-per-line phenomenon, after sending the message; it didn't require any manual copy-and-pasting, just a simple reply in ASCII text.

I sent a bug report about this to Yahoo on Feb. 4 or so, and after a few back-and-forths from them over the next couple of days, the problem went away (I guess they fixed it, but they never told me).
Bob:
Thanks for the update.  Just tried out patching a copied text into a new e-mail via Firefox -- and it works correctly.
Doug
