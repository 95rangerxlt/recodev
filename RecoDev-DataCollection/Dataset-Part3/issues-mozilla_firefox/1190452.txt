Let's make a dedicated bug to get rid of dbg-server.jsm.
This jsm is useless as we should import this module via
   const { DebuggerServer } = require("devtools/server/main");
(Instead of Cu.import("resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-server.jsm", {}))

All usages of dbg-server.jsm prevent correctly reloading server files when using local source directory.

Let's see what try says:

patch v2

This time, I'm not removing the jsm as it is used in too many addons.
... but I've dispatched some previous try run with dbg-server.jsm removed to verify there was no more usages. Some new one may slit through, we would have to verify during reviews and may be a bit latter, check m-c codebase for possible new usages of it.

Should dbg-server.jsm log a deprecation notice when it's used?

It's not a big deal if they keep using it or if we keep this alias.
But yes, we could do that. I would do that a bit later once file are moved, loader paths are cleaned up and everything is more stable as things might change again.
Btw, I've pushed two try just before landing.
One removing dbg-server.jsm:
  https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=9cc2dd728d33
And another without removing it (what actually landed):
  https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=585e58baa292

Everything was green (enough)!
