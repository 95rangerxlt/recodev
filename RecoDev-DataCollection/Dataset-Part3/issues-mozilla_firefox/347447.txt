Both Clearlooks and the default Gtk2 theme (on unstable Debian) seem to have some additional padding and a vsep between the back & foward buttons and their history dropdown. Looks odd with the new theme...

The extra graphics on the buttons look a bit weird if you hide the dropdown:
  #nav-bar .toolbarbutton-menubutton-dropmarker { display: none; }
(although I wouldn't expect a change here and will likely comment this)

Clearlooks is the second set
Actually, all the buttons except the magnifying glass endcap on the search bar exhibit this problem, which also causes extra horizontal (and vertical?) spacing for all the toolbar buttons.  I don't know why that search bar magnifying glass gets it right.

Filed as bug 347470.
I believe that bug 347416 will fix this.

Yup, with the patch on that bug applied, my branch build no longer exhibits this bug.
--> Firefox2 as is bug 347416

The fix that has currently landed for bug 347416, at least, does not fix this issue.
just an fyi... tested with Bon Echo nightly 2006081704; Help | Help Contents Back and Forward buttons look good. But the browser window still displays this bug.
I wrote this on IRC a few weeks back, but seemingly never in a bug.

I think there are two ways to fix this.
(1) Remove the bevels around the buttons and just display things like on other OSes.  This fixes the bug and gets us cross-OS consistency.  It is not clear to me whether it makes consistency with GTK conventions worse.  Most of the other programs I use on Linux have bevels on buttons, but they have them all the time, not just on hover.
(2) Keep the bevels, but change how/when the "surrounds" (circular arcs connecting back to the main arrow) on the dropmarkers are drawn.  When the main button is hovered, bevel it only (just like we do now), and draw no surrounds.  When the dropdown is hovered, bevel the entire area, and draw the surrounds.  This would require image and binding changes, but I think it would allow us to be more consistent with GTK conventions, and I think it would make the dropdown function clearer.

FWIW, I think option (2) would be a good change on all platforms, not just Linux.

Another (minor) reason to do option (2) (and to do it on all platforms) is that some users (via userChrome.css) remove the dropdowns on the buttons.  As-is, this makes the back/forward buttons look incredibly odd on hover.  Implementing option (2) would make this "just work".

I am stupid.  What we do now is what I want in the case where the dropmarker is hovered (we draw one bevel around everything), but it ISN'T what I'm suggesting when just the main icon is hovered (we currently bevel both portions separately, instead of just beveling the main icon.

Idea: Make gnomestripe more like winstripe

This kills bevels on gtk2 and also kills some a11y stuff which is interfering.

Disable native theming on inner button

This patch fixes the broken pill on gtk2 without eliminating bevels or anything like that.
