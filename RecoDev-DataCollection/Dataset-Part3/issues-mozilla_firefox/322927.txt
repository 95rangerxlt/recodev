<input style='cursor:pointer;top:110px;left:0px;width:120px;text-align:center;' type='button' name='bSubmit3' id="bSubmit3"  value='Submit Your Choice' onClick='Javascript:RadiosSelected();'> 
I am a developer and so when this button apparently stopped working for no reason on a page I was writing... well it wasted a couple of hours until I tried clicking all the way along and found that onclick was only detected at the left 20% of the buttons area. Increased the width to 800px to see if I could make some sense of this and found that the pattern of "event sensation" became more random. Click was detected at the extreme left and over the text, but not in the area between. 

I have other buttons on the page which are defined almost identically except for having different names and ids and different javascript functions called, and these all work as expected. 

This error does not occur in IE.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:  
A couple of months ago on a different page I found that a button apparently went dead. That time I couldn't figure it out and ended up rewriting that block of the page. I don't know how to reproduce this. It occurs rarely.


Obviously the entire surface of the button should respond to an onclick event since this event was defined within the input tag. I speculate that this may be a problem integrating normal HTML objects with CSS positioning.

immediately after submitting this bug I discovered the reason for it.
It was my error. the input tag was written within a div with a width set to 20px.
The portion of the button that was beyond the right hand boundary of the div appeared as normal but was insensitive to events.
No patch got checked in, so this bug is not fixed, maybe it is invalid.
Could you attach a testcase of what problem you were experiencing?
