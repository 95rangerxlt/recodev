If someone is viewing a URL that has a username and password in it; e.g.

https://username:password@sexytime.com/sexyfile.wmv

we need to clear out the username and password section of the URL before adding it to a crash report.

This works, except it isn't happy with URLs such as about:config, resulting in an error getting dumped to the console for each blank tab opened. I guess I could just wrap the call in another try/catch block... Any suggestions?
Ideally you could just use nsIURIFixup::createExposableURI, but that seems to obey a pref for whether to remove the username/password, which we don't really want. I guess just wrapping it in a try/catch is the way to go, since you don't really care about the other stuff createExposableURI does.
Adam: Any progress on this issue?

Updated to comments. Do I need some sort of test to go along with this nowadays?

For the moment sessionstore is disabled during tests so you wouldn't be able to anyways.
