Followup to Bug 1119799
Our current new user onboarding flow is largely a "default" experience â€” the result of many small decisions instead of a comprehensive plan and there are a number of issues that would be good to solve.

* Our messaging in this flow doesn't make the Mozilla - Firefox relationship clear or what the real user benefit of Mozilla's non-profit status is.
* The design, branding and messaging is inconsistent throughout and it's not easily updatable.
* The user doesn't know where they are in the process. There are progress bars but they only cover the progress of discreet pieces of the flow.
* Firefox Account sign up/sign in is largely missing. Having this is important to other product and services work that is ongoing.
* If you opt-out of the default browser choice or your OS doesn't have this option, you get a modal dialog that interferes with the feature tour.
* This flow includes a tour of new features which is more appropriate for an existing user who is updating. As a new user or a user installing on a new computer, I want to get things set up.

I've created an interactive prototype that address these issues - http://people.mozilla.org/~mverdi/projects/firstrun/prototype

Some notes:

* This is the flow for Windows users. In this flow, Mac users would start at the data import step though we'd probably want to add a special step before that to provide some context (or create an installer).
* I've taken a stab at updating the messaging and drawing a clearer line between Mozilla and Firefox. Like everything else, this is not final. I'm sure the Creative team will have lots of ideas here.
* I've added a fake (not dynamic) progress bar that will help people see where they are across all parts of the flow (website, stub installer, migration tool, tour).
* Much of the process happens in a window without browser controls (possibly an extension to the migration tool) so it can be done as a set up flow where individual steps can be skipped but you can't just bail out of the whole thing.
* I've added a Firefox Account (technically Sync) sign up/sign in that will sync your data once you've verified your email (either at a later time, in another browser or on another device).
* The default browser prompt is no longer opt-out or a modal. It also doesn't let you dismiss it forever before getting to give Firefox a try.
* Finally, the "tour" section that loads with the Firefox window is just a continuation of the process and doesn't have it's own opt-in doorhanger.
Review?
That looks great Michael!
It also looks like this can be broken up into more manageable steps pretty easily. The first of them is to make the data import dialog look more like the stub installer (bug 1139682).

How do you feel about breaking the rest up as follows (not necessarily in that order):
- New messaging for the stub installer (creative team)
- Addition of the overarching progress bar (UX bug needed for visual design)
- Addition of account creation on first run
- Remove default browser prompt on first run, but show it on second run (Engineering bug needed)
- Changes to downloads page (web prod)
- Adjust the flow based on the results of the experiments you've been running if needed (like the one about add-on installs)
- Scope the work on getting more features (like account signup) into the stub installer (engineering breakdown bug needed)

By the way, one thing that is slightly unrealistic is that in your mocks the stub installer has exactly the same window size as the browser ;)

Michael, what do you think of those next steps? If they seem fine to you, could you file the required bugs?
Thanks Philipp. As we discussed I filed these bugs (or made them blocking) to get started:

Bug 1103164 - New content for the stub installer
Bug 1142773 - [UX] Visual design for new user onboarding progress bar
Bug 1143108 - Add the Firefox default browser prompt to the migrator
Bug 1041514 - Don't show default browser prompt on first run if a user opts out in the installer
Bug 1143116 - Don't use the modal default browser prompt on first run
