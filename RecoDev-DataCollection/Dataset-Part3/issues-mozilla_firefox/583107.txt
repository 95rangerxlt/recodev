                              .getInterface(Ci.nsIWebNavigation)

Hi David,

I don't understand the importance of this bug:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=583107

Is this just a removal of code, or is there a change in behavior here? (And,
most importantly, is there any user impact?)
-------------------------------

I think gavin means that we need a less "shortcuty" way to identify and get a handle on the dom window or web console that is currently focused. So this is not just a removal of code but also writing a better method that is part of the HUDService.
There's no direct user impact, apart from possible bugs related to using the "focused" window rather than a direct reference. Just a code sanity issue that I think we should fix.
OK, code sanity issue can wait a little bit to get to it. Thanks for the clarification!
