Also, when I have 'All Sites' selected and search in the Saved Passwords box for the site that has the saved basic auth credentials it shows up.  But when I find the site in the about:permissions box, it says '0 passwords are saved for this website'.

Maybe Basic Auth Prompts should be suppressed (no Usage?) when about:permissions is loaded?
I believe this is caused by bug 670341, which is more of a problem with the favicon service API.
The fix for bug 670341 was just pushed to mozilla-central. Could you try out the latest Nightly build tomorrow and see if this problem still exists?
I certainly will.  I will let you know tomorrow if it works.

For me it's fixed. Tested against Tinderbox Build http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/c7ea065539d2 what contains the Fix for Bug 670341.
I've confirmed that nightly no longer brings up the basic auth window when opening about:permissions.

On a somewhat related note - I am still seeing the issue from Comment #1.  Should I open a separate ticket for that?  Thanks.
