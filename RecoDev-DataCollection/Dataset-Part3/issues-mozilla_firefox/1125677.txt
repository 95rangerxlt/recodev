This is not a problem in 36.  Tim, do you remember what bug would be affecting the find bar background / text color in 37+?
Bug 891258 regressed this. For this bug, we can just override [0] inside devedition.css

Updates the text style on findbar to just inherit so it looks reasonable on light and dark theme.  Also updates the ::-moz-selection styling for the textbox since it's color is updated.

Do we need to prefix this with something like .browserContainer > findbar to make sure it's only targeting this particular element?  The styles being overriden here are in toolkit/themes/*/global/findBar.css.

Maybe... what happens in e.g. view source right now? OTOH, in what other kinds of windows is devedition.css loaded?

Just confirmed - it doesn't get applied to the view source window.  Devedition.css is only loaded in browser.xul.  Although I guess an extension could inject a findbar element inside of this window?

r+ with, yeah, better-safe-than-sorry specific selector.

Probably wise in the end, even if there isn't anything in default Firefox, it doesn't really hurt, ditto for an equally not super-specific selector like ".found-matches" below. :-)
