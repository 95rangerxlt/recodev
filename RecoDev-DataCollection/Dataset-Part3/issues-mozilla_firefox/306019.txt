When you want to bookmark a page and click on "Bookmarks"/"Bookmark This Page
..." oder type Cmd+D the "Show all the bookmarks folders" and the "Add" buttons
don't work as expected. On clicking "Add" nothing happens, on clicking "Show all

but the listing of the bookmarks folders doesn't appear. 

Reproducible: Always

The problem is, that I don't see a "Show all the Bookmarks Folders" or "Add"
buttons neither in branch nor in trunk.
But there are currently problems with the feature, see Bug 304705 and Bug 305928.
For the latter bug there seems to be a patch. 
I can reproduce this behaviour here, using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS
X Mach-O; de; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050826 Firefox/1.0+
This makes the whole Bookmark-feature hard to use.
This was still working in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; de;
rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050823 Firefox/1.0+, lets see if the next round of builds
fixes the "expand"-problem.
actually, it seems to work again with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X
Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050826 Firefox/1.0+ - so it probably has been
fixed by the checkin of bug 305928.
works for me
