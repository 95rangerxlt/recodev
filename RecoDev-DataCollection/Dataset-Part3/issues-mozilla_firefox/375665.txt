New "Add Bookmark" dialog

Add Bookmark dialog has been changed by bug 357316.
But new Add Bookmark dialog has a button that has
no label.
I think this button is used to show Bookmark tree.

example style

1. Pinstripe has the style for #expander.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/themes/pinstripe/browser/places/bookmarkProperties.css#64
2. Winstripe has not the style for #expander.
3. In case of Non Places Add Bookmark dialog, XUL file (addBookmark2.xul) use arrow.css.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/bookmarks/content/addBookmark2.xul#43
4. In case of Places Add Bookmark dialog, XUL file (bookmarkProperties.xul) not use arrow.css.
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/places/content/bookmarkProperties.xul#40
I think that a similar style is necessary also for bookmarkProperties.css of Winstripe.

I can't see any warnings/errors.
I think your problem is the another one.
Today's build is the same as attachment 259891 for me.

Asaf, thanks to check in.
Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.

Gerv
