When using WebIDE with the ADB helper addon, previously open ADB sessions get closed. This is annoying for developers who are watching `adb logcat` while using the WebIDE.

It's not only about logcat, but I may have one device connected to debug an app and another flashing gecko/gaia for instance.
adb helper addon shouldn't mess up with existing adb instances in first place!
And that's what the addon is meant to do.
We have a module for checking already running adb instances.
I'm wondering if it is just about this too strict version checking test over here:
  https://github.com/mozilla/adbhelper/blob/master/adb-running-checker.js#L43
We should accept any somewhat recent version and not only just one arbitrary one!
Can you be more specific about when you notice the external ADB session is terminated?

In a few quick tests, I saw a logcat session get terminated on close of Firefox, but it remained open otherwise.

Is that what you see, or are there other issues?

I saw parallel logcat getting killed when starting/stopping Firefox.

Stop server, but only if we started it

This change allows ADB to stay alive for me, assuming the server was alive before Firefox was started.

Jan, does this fix the issue for you?
Thanks for the fix! Forwarding to Alexandre who originally complained about this.
It seems to work properly now, thanks!

Released as 0.5.2.

If you installed the test build, it should receive a proper update to the released one (or at least it did for me).
