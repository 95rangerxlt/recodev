Ideally this will be user customizable, but this is correct default behavior.
A if tabs will be in title bar, then what? You will put them back to tab bar and above that you will put menu bar? That seems wrong to me.

Then it would also be up to the user to decide where they want to place the
menu bar (or if they want to use one).
Then it is OK.
Huh ?  I thought the Menu Bar was going away in favor of the Firefox or 'application' button ?
No. Menu bar will be off by default, but it will be still there for users who want to bring it back, temporarily or permanently.
Really? I don't use the feature but I would expect them quite on top, as an easier target for the mouse. On top = on top.

I think this order would be clearer:
#toolbar-menubar {}
#navigator-toolbox[tabsontop="true"] > #TabsToolbar {}
#navigator-toolbox > toolbar:not(#toolbar-menubar):not(#TabsToolbar) {}
#TabsToolbar {}

The second selector overrides the fourth one, reflecting that in the order seems clearer to me.
