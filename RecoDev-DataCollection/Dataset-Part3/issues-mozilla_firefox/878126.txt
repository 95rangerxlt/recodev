1) In OSX with a Retina display, enter customization mode
2) Look at the subscribe icon

It has no icon. :/

Stephen, I think we'll need an upscaled icon for this.
There is an @2x icon in the menuPanel-icons@2x.png sprite

Fix HiDPI icons for XUL buttons inside the customization palette

Mike, this is a patch that fixes it, but in a dirty way... (old) XUL button selectors, `#feed-button` in this case, take precedence over the descendant selector inside the hidpi media query block.

I can take this route, but I could also add more selectors to define the list-image that are more specific and include the XUL button ids (using `@primaryToolbarButtons@`?).

Hm, yeah, I don't prefer this solution.

Using @primaryToolbarButtons@ in a :-moz-any sounds like a better solution. Perhaps these rules can go directly in browser.css after the .toolbarbutton-1 rules.
