Mike, can you explain what weirdness you were seeing? Is it only on osx or linux? This is what I get on Windows, http://screencast.com/t/BFqrR4kVl6

I'll kick off a linux build now to test it out there.

Customize mode and a lw-theme on OSX

I think this is what I was seeing - the buttons look strange, and the selected tab still shows the lw-theme.

Don't show the grid when a lightweight theme is applied

This allows the lightweight theme to continue to show when in customization mode.

The toolbarbuttons will need a bit more work.

This combines the previous patch as well as a fix for the toolbarbuttons. It looks like we only need to handle the unified-back-forward button as special now.

Personally, I think we should essentially disable the LWT when entering customization mode. I'll add a screenshot to back this up in a bit, but essentially, because the background only stretches to a little bit below the toolbar area, and in customization mode might not even fully reach the bottom of it if the user has extra toolbars from add-ons etc., it ends up looking quite unpolished, especially without the grid texture etc.

I'm wondering if the easiest fix wouldn't be just disabling the LWT for the duration of customization, using some JS?

Yeah, lightweight themes don't look that good since they are missing the rest of the browser window. I do however think applying a lightweight theme here is nice because it shows what the browser will look like when customization is exited (better idea of direct manipulation if we can show the user what the outcome will be after customization).

Maybe we could fade the lightweight theme out after the tab strip and show the grid for the bottom half of the browser? I'm not sure how hard that would be. Maybe apply an SVG mask to do this, but that sounds like a great way to make entering customization mode janky.

Turning off lightweight themes while in customization mode seems like the easier and simpler approach. I'll update the patch.

Patch v2

This patch disables lightweight themes when in customization mode, as well as fixing the look of the buttons while in the menu panel and toolbar buttons.
I forgot to mention that this patch is dependent on the patch in bug 879994.

Patch v2

This looks like the same patch you had before; it doesn't call the method you added in bug 879994... Clearing review request for now.

Patch v2.1

I don't think lazily loading LightweightThemeManager.jsm will help much here because it's always referenced in enter() and exit(), but I can change that if you think it would still be beneficial.

Nah, don't think there's much point in lazy-loading it. As you said, its always called in enter() anyway, and we're careful to only load CustomizeMode.jsm module when enter() is about to be called. And anyway, LightweightthemeManager.jsm is already guaranteed to be loaded on startup by the Add-ons Manager - that's the biggest concern.
