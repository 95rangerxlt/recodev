Once the currently pending pull requests are merged, I'd like to merge the latest version of the source-map library with fx-team. This will add some functionality to the source-map library that I need for the breakpoint sliding refactor, and fix several bugs as well.

I have a patch ready that copies over the latest version of SourceMap.jsm and source-map.js, and fixes some test errors that I encountered in the process. The only thing I'm unsure about  is how I should merge the test files, since the source-map library seems to use a different naming convention (all dashes) than fx-team (mixed underscores and dashes).

Is this something that changed recently, and should I update the test file names in fx-team to reflect those in the source-map library? Or should I copy over the files and change the names in the process?

Needinfo'ing fitzgen. Since he's the author of the source-map lib, this should be his call.
We should probably just make this an actual shell script: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/sourcemap/UPGRADING.md

patch

This patch merges version 0.4.0 of the source-map library with fx-team. Note that I had to change a few tests to account for the fact that we now use a different bias when searching for generated locations.

Also note that this includes an outstanding pull request that I forgot to make yesterday, so I'm going out on a limb here and assume this PR will be accepted (its a fairly simple change, so it should be ok).

This is probably overkill, but here's a try push for the new patch:

Does this include sokra's missing `var` fix so we don't accidentally use a global variable?

Doesn't look like it.

I've fixed some additional bugs since the previous patch was reviewed, which need to be merged as well. Here's a patch that includes those.
sorry had to back this out for testfailures like https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=2210695&repo=fx-team

The test failures mentioned in comment 12 are probably a fluke. I cannot reproduce them locally, and they do not reoccur when I retrigger the test:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=b6c511f17246

Moreover, the nature of the test failure is such that if its not a fluke, I would expect it to fail on other platforms as well.

Asked Tomcat for permission and he was ok with me trying to land again, so here goes:

Turns out that test failure, though intermittent, is actually quite common. Most likely it's a gc bug.

Meanwhile, I've made even more changes to the source map library, so instead of merging everything three times, I've coalesced everything into one patch. Note that this patch also includes the latest PR, which you didn't merge yet.

Right now, I suspect the culprit is breakpoint_dbg_source-map-01.js. Because I changed the search bias, I had to change the empty line from line 3 to line 1 in order to end up on line 2. However line 1 is not within the same function. I changed this to line 7 in the hope that this remedies the problem:

sorry eddy seems this backed out and then missed the backout comment https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/16d5174d38bc
The above try run looks promising, but was suffering from some infra bustage. I want to make double sure that I've got it right this time, since the issue is most likely timing sensitive, and I cannot reproduce it locally.

Here's another try run:

This one is supposed to be obsolete now, right?
The new patch is identical to the one that ran on try, except for two additional tests. I double checked those locally, and the try push itself looks good, so here we go again:
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/67630b38caf4
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/67630b38caf4
We don't really need a separate bug for this anymore.
