User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130627161625

Steps to reproduce:

1. Right click a toolbar item, click Customise...
2. Drag the Search bar to the dialog that appeared.
3. Click Done.
4. Try to set a different search engine.


Actual results:

There was no way to set it without restoring the Search toolbar item.


Expected results:

One should be able to configure this in e.g. the Preferences window or a menu entry. With keyword.URL set to be replaced by the search preferences (bug #738818), this option becomes relevant even to those who do not use the search bar.
