We need to update the shipped-locales file for Firefox 3 RC 1.

The exhibit to gather our data sources is on http://l10n.mozilla.org/dashboard/Firefox3/RC1/.

Currently green, but not signed off are

German (tier 1)
Traditional Chinese, Czech (tier 2)
Portueguese (Portugal), Albanian.

Georgian is still red, but approaching today.

All of these have been approached by mail.

The count of locales (+en-US, -ja-JP-mac) is at 40 as we speak.

Web pages stuff for release is not tracked here, see http://l10n.mozilla.org/webdashboard/ for the status of that.

Off track compare to fx2 is bg, sl is worked on, but won't make RC1.

We have source verification for webservices in place now, too, so we can keep that under control, and the l10n Firefox tree is frozen for

Further to Axel's note. We fully expect those locales he mentioned that are green but not opted in, to opt in with completed testing etc before RC1 deadline (i.e., next few days). 

ka we're hopeful will also hit a green tinderbox shortly

We will be updating the list as they come online. 

sl had the main localizers drop out (so to speak) and brian king has taken over. we are working with Brian to get them in (doing everything we can) for final release as we have a large users base (almost 50% share) in their language/country.
Axel really owns this, afaict.

add ga-IE, remove gu-IN on mac [landed]

Adding back ga-IE, they missed just B5. Bug 428317 makes us pull Gujarati on the mac for now.

This list is the "getting builds" list, it has the following caveats:

cs, ka, sq have not opted in yet, and we don't have testing results for those locales yet. Including them is the optimistic approach, all of them had betas so far, too.
We have pushed off a few product handler fixes and wikipedia additions off the 3.0 blocker list and moved them into separate bugs from the webservices ones.

Just checking - are Hebrew and Arabic still busted on mac ?

So you may want to change this list before staging the builds on the ftp server ?

Does that mean they're no longer blockers ? Given where we are with the blocker lists, there is still time to fix stuff in l10n, and get opt in.

We're still enjoying bug 364536, yes, waiting for review from mconnor right now.

Yes. Is there a good way to track that?

The risk analysis for patches to land for l10n works slightly different. They're on my "wanted" list, and I'm not strictly working on "if it's not a blocker, it's not gonna get landed". Both the resource constraints and the risk is different in l10n land.

This patch is the "get this off the blocker list", and is supposed to get us the builds we need for the rest of the release cycle. If we need additional locales, on different platforms, we'll need to land those as follow ups.

add ga-IE, remove gu-IN on mac [landed]

Alright, this can get us started then. 

It'd be much cleaner for us if this list stays the same, or only gets shorter, as we go through the release process. So please err on the side of inclusion at this stage (if you haven't already).

> Yes. Is there a good way to track that?

I set blocking on our bug for release config. Reopen this and we'll notice.
 

We're in the splendid situation that it's safe to err on the inclusion side. No busted trees or anything like that anywhere close, all that's green is green. The only open items are QA, and if RC1 is 3.0, webparts, all of which currently only make the list smaller.

The locales not included in this list are having significant localization work open, and are out of consideration for RC1. We might look again for RC2.

Reopening, bug 364536, Mac theme does not support RTL, landed, and I think it's good enough for us to create builds for those languages and to expose them in RC 1.

ship ar and he for all platforms including mac [landed]

http://l10n.mozilla.org/~axel/screens/ar/mac.html and http://l10n.mozilla.org/~axel/screens/he/mac.html are the latest screen shots from the dialogs. I skimmed over the main window, awesomebar, add-ons manager and larry and with my complete lack of knowledge of those languages, and their issues on our other platforms, I didn't see any blockers.

Thus I think we should do the necessary to get those builds into the release chain, the review for this patch and the rationale goes to beltzner.

This makes me happy.
