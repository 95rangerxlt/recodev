The moz.build transition broke Android Nightlies:

14:38:37    ERROR -  make: *** ../../services/sync/locales: No such file or directory.  Stop.
14:38:37    ERROR -  make[1]: *** [chrome-cs] Error 2
14:38:37    ERROR - Return code: 2
14:38:37    ERROR - Failed to add locale cs!
14:38:39    ERROR -  make: *** ../../services/sync/locales: No such file or directory.  Stop.
14:38:39    ERROR -  make[1]: *** [chrome-da] Error 2
14:38:39    ERROR - Return code: 2

The reason is https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/locales/Makefile.in#165 references /services/sync/locales/Makefile. Since MOZ_SERVICES_SYNC isn't enabled on Android, /services/sync doesn't get included in the build configuration and thus /services/sync/locales/Makefile does not get built.

We need to first assess which mobile products need /services/sync/locales and then change the build system to include it for those products. Perhaps this means moving the offending line in the Makefile.in into a per-app directory instead of the shared /mobile/locales/Makefile.in. But, I'm not really sure how all this stuff works in mobile land, so I dunno.

We have about 12 hours to fix this bug before tomorrow doesn't get a new Nightly and people start yelling.

Over to rnewman to figure out what mobile products use Sync's locale files. Please reassign as appropriate.

Try build without that locale dependency:

https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=067eaefe583e

As far as I'm concerned, none of our supported mobile products depend on services/sync/locales, so removing the line is the right fix. I anticipate that the Android build will work.

That is probably not true for Metro, because Metro uses XUL Mobile (and it's not true for XUL Fennec, but 0fg).

Over to ally to investigate that side, or to 302 to someone who knows.
My reading of configure and ally's .mozconfig is that Metro uses MOZ_BUILD_APP==browser (just like desktop Firefox).

According to rnewman we don't need these locale files on mobile/android. And, I don't believe we have any Sync consumers in mobile/xul. Therefore, I think it is safe to eliminate the reference to the Sync locale files from /mobile/locales/Makefile.in.

This should not impact Metro.
I am fairly certain that Metro still needs that. I am unable to get ahold of my resident windows metro build authority though.

I think the per app directory approach makes sense in the long run as metro will need things like that.

Greg is investigating what to do to keep the file for us.
gps' understanding of the universe is more correct than mine. disregard comment 3. :)
This makes Android build correctly:

Ally, could you try a Metro build with that applied?

LGTM.

I think we should check this in to m-c ASAP because it will presumably unbust a tier 1 platform's Nightly builds. If it regresses Metro, a tier 2 platform, we can fix that in a follow-up patch/bug.

Let's see if this works.
I built metro with rnewman's patch on mozilla-inbound successfully
