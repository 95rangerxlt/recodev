I ran across this code in rule-view.js on fx-team (the code I
see in DXR is different):

      if (promise === this._applyingModifications) {
        this._applyingModifications = null;
      }

This checks "promise" against _applyingModifications, but
I think it should check "modificationsPromise" instead.

This seems to have been introduced by bug 1184746, which
renamed the other uses of "promise" in this method.

Julian, maybe you could fix this up?
Sure, let me fix that, sorry.

Renamed variable and modified a test to fail in case the cleanup of the promise is not properly done.

Try is green. Waiting for review.

Actually no, it's not. I have a failure on the test I modified on Linux opt M-e10s.

Bug1190944.v2.patch

I tried to reproduce the test failure I had on try on my Ubuntu VM, without success so far. And I won't have much time to investigate more before next week.

Since this was not tested before, we can also fix the code issue for now, and create another bug to add tests later ?

This patch only contains the code fix, with no test update.
Try push :  https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=4714c1e4a474

Depending on the urgency of the fix I'll let you decide how to proceed. 


===================================================================
Some additional information for assessing the urgency below : 

For information, this error has no functional impact.
As far as I can tell, the only consequence is that already resolved promises will be unnecessarily added to a "promise.all" call. 
They are already resolved, they won't do anything except add their value to the output of promise.all. 

But this output of this promise.all is not used : 
> return promise.all(promises).then(() => {
>      return this._populate(true);
> });

We can't land code with failing tests and we don't appear to have failing tests without this fix so we whould wait for you to investigate further.

The mochitest should now be fixed. To make sure the modificationsPromise is fully executed we are now yielding it. Only then do we check that the reference in the rule-view has been cleaned up.

I performed several try tests without failure. Here is a new one for the submitted patch : https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=9676d5e72565
Sorry for the delay, Julian. Mike is actually on PTO. So, I flagged bgrins to do the review.

Thanks! This can land after the nit is addressed

Nit: the order of these arguments should be swapped so that it's `is(actual, expected)`

is(ruleEditor.rule._applyingModifications, null, ...)
