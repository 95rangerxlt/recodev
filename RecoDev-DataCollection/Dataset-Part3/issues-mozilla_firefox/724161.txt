The patch for bug 718203 exposes a nicer API for filtering out javascript:/data: link drops, we should make use of that rather than having different string-comparison checks.

I would expect this to load the links in the current tab, but you're expecting new tabs. What's going on here?

Good catch. The synthesizeDrop code is producing events with screenX/screenY equal to 0, which makes _getDragTargetTab return null.

Fixing synthesizeDrop to pass realistic coordinates seems like it might be annoying. What do you think about just adding a comment explaining the reliance on the bug?
Could the synthetic drop target the left or right side of the tab so that it keeps working in case that bug gets fixed?

There's no way to control the specific coordinates of the drop. I think anyone fixing synthesizeDrop to pass non-bogus coordinates will also have to add support for specifying custom offsets to avoid breaking the world, so it makes more sense to just deal with this test when (if) that happens.
