It looks like the overlay code is not smart enough to notice that we are loading
the same CSS files from two overlays, the one of the indicator and the one of the
panel.

So, either we split the CSS in two files, one for the indicator and one for the
panel, or we rewrite the loading process to ensure that the indicator overlay is
always loaded before the panel overlay, and keep the CSS in the indicator overlay
only.
Marco says we can simplify this when we drop support for the old downloads UI.

The patch

This separates the indicator and panel stylesheets, fixing the duplicate rules.
