"Alt-F S" is too deeply entrenched as being "Save" in just about every app out
there; having it be Send, which is potentially an expensive operation (opening
up Thunderbird|Evolution|Outlook|Whatever) sucks.  IE uses "e", can we do the same?

IE also uses S for "Save", which I'd be also inclined to do, but I don't care so
much about that (Alt-F S will do nothing after this patch).
