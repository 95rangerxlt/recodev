forgotten line to mass change escape() to encodeURIComponent()
*** Bug 228843 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Sorry I missed this in my patch for bug 225695. Why don't you ask for r/sr
either here or in bug 225695 (after making this as a dupe of bug 225695 and
uploading your patch there)?

Reopening as I only landed on trunk.
We need approval to FIREBIRD_0_8_BRANCH.
pch, could you take a look at this?
-> Reopen
When was FB 0.8 branch cut? Was it after my patch for bug 44272 got landed? Was
it before or after my patch for bug 225695 got in (December 3rd)? If it's before
my treewide sweep got in.  My treewide sweep patch in bug 225695 also needs a0.8.
jshin:
after. so, your patch is already (automatically) on 0.8 branch.
sure, go ahead
