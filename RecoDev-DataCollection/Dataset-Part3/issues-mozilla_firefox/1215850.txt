patch, v1

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0ea13f8b1e77 added shouldRestartTitle to preferences.properties, but it already had this one. Translations are identical http://mxr.mozilla.org/l10n-mozilla-aurora/search?string=shouldRestartTitle
The older one is for restarting to enable a 'feature'.

shouldRestartTitle is referenced in main.js, privacy.js, and blocklists.js. blocklistChangeRequiresRestart is referenced in blocklists.js. We can't remove one of them without updating references to it.

It seems to me that blocklistChangeRequiresRestart was intended to give more details as to why Firefox should be restarted. As of now, it looks like the dialog will have [title=Restart Firefox, message=Restart Firefox].

The string doesn't change any functionality. shouldRestartTitle has been defined twice in preferences.properties:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d53a52b39a95dced722cca90ac74529b66dd5253/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/preferences.properties#53

Both have the value "Restart %S". So this won't change the behavior of Firefox. The removal of the duplicate shall prevent issues in localization tools and one translation overriding the other one in case someone translated them different.

Because the patch doesn't touch blocklistChangeRequiresRestart, the dialog will remain unchanged.

Okay, thanks for the reply. I misunderstood the goal of this patch. This change looks fine to me.
