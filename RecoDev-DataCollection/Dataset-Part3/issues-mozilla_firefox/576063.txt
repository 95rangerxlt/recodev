Regression from bug 575994? The blue, mouse sensing border area shrunk to about a pixel or two, making it unreliable to hit on mouse moves.
This is not a regression - bug 490621
Well, there might be a regression, but I'm not sure what it is. Are you saying that you move the mouse to the very top and the browser UI doesn't appear?
I see, the small border becomes a problem when the firefox button is visible. So the solution is to remove the button.

This works now that bug 571813 is fixed, the titlebar with menu disappeared, but the autohide row seems to be not on the screen edge in fullscreen mode, but on the 2nd pixel row only, which makes it hard to hit and is jumpy.  

Reminds me of bug 575493 not to recognize the edge in maximized mode.

In short yes, the screen edge doesn't trigger un-hide, only the second row.
It's hard to show tab bar (no matter how much i mouse over top of the screen) in fullscreen mode with 20100707 build. Should we re-open?

You should probably file a new bug with your exact configuration and steps to reproduce.

We set a bottom border on the toolbox when tabs are on top. Apparently clientHeight doesn't take this into account.

Aren't we supposed to prefer getBoundingClientRect() nowadays? I suppose it's wordier, but could put it in a local variable.
using getBoundingClientRect:
