fix-remote-focus.patch

When we transition the "remote" state of a browser element, it gets removed from the DOM, so it loses focus. Navigating from about:newtab to, say, google.com won't bring focus to the search box.

This patch changes _updateBrowserRemoteness() to check if the element was in focus, and re-sends the focus event if necessary.
