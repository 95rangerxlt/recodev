Support automated config bump for windows and mac

This is a follow on to the changes in bug 371325 (in particular attachment 262198 and attachment 262602). This patch has the matching changes for Windows and Mac, and also

* uses %l10n_buildDir% in the WGet config for l10n repacks
* doesn't use %buildTree% for l10n, because my reading of [1] is that the mail for individual locales will get sent to non-existent trees

Looks good; should we do this for 1.8.0 as well?

bootstrap.cfg

I've left the CVS pullDate's empty since those are still unknown and the tagging is going to be done manually anyway. Will fill in the blanks when the info is known. All the buildDir and buildPlatform are verified from the tinderboxen. Based on the latest and greatest boostrap.cfg.example.

You want to point all of the _TAGs to FIREFOX_2_0_0_4_RELEASE.

Attaching the correct patch this time.

Looks good; as you pointed out, the NSS and NSPR tags don't get bumped; the diff chunk in the previous patch confuzzled me.

r=preed, a=preed for landing on GECKO181_20070501_RELBRANCH  only.

moz18-branch-patcher2.cfg changes

I've included ro (romanian, a new beta locale for 2.0.0.4) in the list in the 2.0.0.4 release block as it's now in shipped-locales. Presumably we will update it to 2.0.0.5 even though we're not advertising the installer at this stage.

moz18-branch-patcher2.cfg changes for RC2

RC1 updates were never generated, so the previous patch is obsolete. Changes are s/rc1/rc2/ in appropriate places, and updated BuildIDs.

Yah, this looks good; I'm confused now, though, 'cause we've talked about it so many times: does patcher2 do everything we want it to do for this release?

Or are we still going to be hacking snippets together somehow, somewhere? I'd like to figure that out today before we generate these snippets.

Fx/Tb - nightly version bumps (for MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH)

These are the post release version bumps for Firefox & Thunderbird. (We'll make the TB version 2.0.0.4 for release separately, using the GECKO181_20070501_BRANCH)

Free Software tinderbox-config changes

This looks fine.

You'll want to check disk space (especially prometheus) before you actually run these builds.
Software released, free software builds on ftp, version bumps done. All finished.
