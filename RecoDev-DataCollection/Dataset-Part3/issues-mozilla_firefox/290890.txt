The Help Window opens with a completely blank right pane. Clicking on a link in
the sidebar doesn't bring any page up. The toolbar icons are equally
non-fucnctional -- except for the 'Customize Toolbar' icon. The titlebar of the
Help Window is blank

Since 20050413. It works fine on 20050313.  I'll try to narrow down the
regression window later.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.From the menu bar --> Help > Browser Help
2.Opens the help window
3.

Actual Results:  
1. Blank right pane (contents area)
2. non-functional toolbar on top
3. unclickable links in the side bar.


Expected Results:  
Open a functional help window

No extensions, fresh profile. Tested with the official builds.

Oops.

Typo fixes don't actually require review, so hopefully I don't have to get
approval for this.  If I need approval, I'll set the flag later.

Patch is in.  I don't use a Mac, so on the off chance there's something else
going on here, please reopen.
this isn't fixed. :-/ I'll post the js errors later...
1. The help window wants to stay on top (and won't minimise). This make it 
impossible to open the Javascript Console whilst the Help is open.

2. I get this error in the Javascript Console"
Datasource: chrome://browser/locale/help/help-toc.rdf was not found.

but nothing else is obviously wrong.
err, from whatever reason this is wfm now... (in the same build). However, i
still see the jsconsole-message mentioned in comment 12
