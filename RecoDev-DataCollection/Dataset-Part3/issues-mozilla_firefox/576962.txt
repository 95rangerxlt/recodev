The console functions like console.log or console.info can take more then one argument. Also, a string passed to these functions containing a newline character (\n) should cause a new line in the console output.

This is not supported yet.

What is the right version?

  ok(/foo bar/.test(outputLogNode.childNodes[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue),
