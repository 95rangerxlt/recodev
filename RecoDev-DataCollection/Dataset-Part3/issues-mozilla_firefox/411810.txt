Yep, had the same problem.  The address bar was puny and couldn't see hardly anything.  Switched back to Firefox Default and everything is fine.
We have to wait for the Developers to get up to speed.

I contacted the developer at the email address provided at his deviantart page ( http://kasteo.deviantart.com/ ) and he indicated he was not aware of the FF3 addon push which included his theme, but also said, "I'm working on updating it at the moment. It should be ready when Firefox 3.0 final is coming out."

Alex, I'm forwarding the email exchange to you.  If you'd like to do any more followup with him you're welcome to.
Mark, Thank you so much for reaching out to him! This is a great update.
Version 3.45 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/72#version-3.45) dated July 12, 2008 is fully compatible with Firefox 3.0.x.

FIXED!
"Firefox 3.0 - 3.6.*" currently. Resolving.
