It appears to be fixed, but if the button is clicked quickly it appears to click
visually, the icon depresses, but the url bar doesnt collapse.

I don't understand what you mean. Could you please explain it in more eays words?

(Sorry for my bad english.)
I was referring to the URL bar, I got confused.  If we are talking about the

Should this be unmarked from blocking? and also add keyword fixed-aviary?
