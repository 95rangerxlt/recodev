Enabling nglayout.debug.paint_flashing shows the issue.
I am unable to reproduce this on 11-14 Nightly Windows 7. The adjacent-right social toolbar button will also paint flash because of the border being adjusted for it, but the rest of the buttons do not flash for me.
For me they flash when I move the cursor out of one of the elements.
When I try this, I see only the button directly to the right of the one the cursor is moved from being invalidated - not ideal, but also not *all* social buttons.  A quick experiment with winstripe/browser.css failed to show me exactly what was causing it though.

From comment #1,
The adjacent-right social toolbar button will also paint flash because the left-border is drawn using the ::before pseudo-element.
I reproduced this in 17 and couldn't reproduce this with 19, so I believe DLBI fixed this. Marking this as fixed since there isn't any work to be done here.

Thanks for filing this Marco!
