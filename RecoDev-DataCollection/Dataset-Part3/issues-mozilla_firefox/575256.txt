The window height is decreased by the height of the menu bar from the bottom when in the maximised state only when going from the normal (restored) state to maximised state with the menu bar displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Ensure it is in a restored (normal) state
3. Enable the menu bar
4. Maximise the window (a)
5. Turn off the menu bar (b)
6. Turn on the menu bar (a)
7. Restore the window (c)
8. Turn off the menu bar (d)
9. Turn on the menu bar (c)
10. Turn off the menu bar (d)
11. Maximise the window (a)
12. Turn on the menu bar (a)
13. Turn off the menu bar (a)
14. Restore the window (c)
Actual Results:  
(a) -- the window takes up the entire screen (excluding the windows start bar)
(b) -- there is a gap between the bottom of the window and the windows start bar that is the height of the menu bar

(c) -- the content area takes up the correct amount of space (the bottom edge between the content area and window edge is the same as the left and right sides)
(d) -- there is an extra space at the bottom of the window that is the height of the menu bar

Expected Results:  
(a) and (b) -- the window takes up the entire screen (excluding the windows start bar)
(c) and (d) -- the content area takes up the correct amount of space

Further testing on the 2010-06-28-03-mozilla-central build, it looks like (b) is actually the same as (d).

That is: the web browser content area is moved up when the menu bar is hidden and it's height is not increased by the height of the menu bar; the size of the window frame is correct in both cases.
I see the glass area gets bigger about the same size as the titlebar drop at the top of the window.
Resizing the window will fix the extra glass being drawn because the window isn't necessarily updated after switching modes between menu bar and drawing in the titlebar with the app menu button.  

btw, there is also bug 575005 for going from the app menu button to menu bar and the status bar disappears.
I only hit this when I actually try and resize the windows with the bottom border after I hit bug 575005 first.  Otherwise it doesn't seem to happening.
This bug affects the windows taskbar if it is set to autohide. When the firefox menu is hidden and maximized, the firefox window is drawn over the taskbar, and the taskbar will not be shown even if it has notifications (program buttons are flashing). With the menu bar shown, the expected behavior of showing the taskbar while autohidden (4 pixels or whatever it is) or showing notifications (not hidden, button flashing) is produced.

That is another bug 575245 which I think your referring.
This should be fixed by the patch that landed in bug 575005.
