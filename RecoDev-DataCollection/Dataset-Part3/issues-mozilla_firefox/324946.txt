Basically the loop simpilifies to:

while(linkNode) {
  linkNode = linkNode.parentNode;
} /* after loop, linkNode is null */
var baseURI = linkNode.baseURI; /* exception */

cc'ing jst because this came from his patch (rv 1.353, bug 249332) :)

This is actually a regression from bug 266932 - the loop used to break once it found a suitable node.

wrapper is a leftover from the explicit XPCNativeWrapper days. How about removing that while you're here?

That makes the patch a lot harder to review, though. File a bug on that, assigned to me (or you, if you want it)?

I only meant the "simple XLink" branch contained in the patch. Do you really want to do clean up all of browser.js?

As far as I can tell, most uses of "wrapper" in browser.js are leftover from when there were wrappers. All the ones in contentAreaClick, for sure.
