I don't see why, since the -moz-image-regions and the image itself look right, but with small icons on Mac, the stop button picks up the last pixel from the forward arrow for :hover and :active, so when you mouse over or click the stop button, you get two black turds on the left edge.

Obligatory screenshot
Ah, apparently I can't count pixels in an image, and it is off by one, so the forward arrow also has turds on the left from the tail end of the back arrow.
since I figured this out, I'll add a bit more specific info.  the regions are set to start the forward arrow on 16 and stop arrow on 32, but the forward arrow starts on pixel 17 and the stop on pixel 32 etc.  All of the icons are "off" by one pixel in this way, up to new tab, which seems to be one pixel smaller, putting new window starting on 160
*sigh* stop pixel starts on *33* etc.
the map thing also refers to pixel 224 but it should be 223
fixed by the main toolbar work
Since this was landed on branch and didn't affect trunk, ->FIXED
