Firefox slows down more and more over time.  Eventually it takes 5 or 10 sec to register a mouse click.  Finally I go to quit it, and then it takes hours as it cycles through every single window asking if I really want to close this one and that one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several windows.
2. Open several tabs in each window.
3. File->Quit.
Actual Results:  
Irritating multiple confirm quit dialogs.

Expected Results:  
Maybe ask once if I really want to quit, then quit.

If you want to get really clever you could display in the quit window a tree of open windows and tabs.

with V3 I believe it now asks once
Now in v4 beta it doesn't ask at all
Considering this bug doesn't seem to affect the latest builds of Firefox(changeset:   62447:704dd93dad14) this bug should be marked "INVALID" or "FIXED".
