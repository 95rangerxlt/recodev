Looking at a full graph suggests that the problem patch is likely in this set:
http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=93cbb921e773&tochange=0327e126ea24
The plugins change (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0327e126ea24) is more likely to have caused this than DOMWindowCreated. Feel free to back it out, or I can tomorrow.
Doesn't back out cleanly, will leave it for you to do tomorrow.
