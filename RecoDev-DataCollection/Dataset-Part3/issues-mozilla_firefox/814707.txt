Zooming using the "Page fit" option doesn't make the page to actually "fit" the window - page is smaller than the window.

Steps:
1. Open a PDF
2. Select "Page fit" from zoom drop-down options

Expected result:
Page is zoomed as much as possible to fit the window

Actual result:
Page is zoomed but not maximum possible (there is still space left both horizontally and vertically)

See attached screenshot

Note: issue is reproducible only in Firefox 18, in Firefox 19 and 20 it works fine.

Please find out if this was ever an issue in Firefox 19 and when it was fixed so that we can evaluate uplifting the fix. Otherwise this is WONTFIX and will ride the trains.

Landed for Firefox 19 on mozilla-central. Unless we plan to ship PDF.js in Firefox 18 I'd say let it ride the trains. 

Alex, do you think it's worth uplifting the fix?
Pdf.js will be disabled for 18. So as long as this is fixed 19 I'll mark it fixed by bug 801280.
