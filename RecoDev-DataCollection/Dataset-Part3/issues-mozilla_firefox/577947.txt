The tabcandy toolbarbutton is a giant button consisting of the downalods, history, bookmarks, new tab and new window button images.

That's because there's no styling for it on winstripe and gnomestripe.

Copies the styling from pinstripe's browser.css to winstripe and gnomestripe.
See http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/gnomestripe/browser/Toolbar-small.png for how the button looks like right now on Linux...

Steffen, not sure if you meant for this bug to actually create Linux- and Win-appropriate styles as well. If not, feel free to close it.

Thanks. Why don't you just set the review flag on the details page of the patch to "+"?

Comment 2 was just meant to be an illustration of the bug, instead of attaching a screenshot. This bug is not about changing the icon itself.

--> marking fixed.
