  The recently checked in Irish l10n (bug 264743) has an out-of-date
installer.inc; it's missing the COMPLETE_RESET_HOMEPAGE #define from bug 262953.

This is breaking the windows tinderbox build:

We're not translating the installer so we just need the latest en-US
version committed.

installer.inc patch
Ben, requesting review.
What's up with this patch? Are all the lines changed, or line-endings or something?
(In reply to comment #3)

Yup -- line endings changed per bug 257834.
After the patch it should match the current
en-US version.
So you want to convert the line endings back to DOS? That sounds wrong.
Attachement 162938 supposedly converted to unix lineendings, which are the right
ones in the repository.
Could we either get a current patch or a -w one?
(In reply to comment #5)

It looks like my patch is removing the DOS line endings as desired.
The - lines ending 0D0A and the + lines end in 0A.
Am I free to commit when approval-aviary+ is set?
Yes, I believe you are free to commit this. Always check
