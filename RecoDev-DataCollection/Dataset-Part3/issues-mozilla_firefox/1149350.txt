Myk mentioned on IRC that an app he works on occasionally runs with stale / cached scripts after installing a new version.

While we don't yet have a clear STR, in discussion we noticed that we could be pass "force: true" when reloading to bypass the cache.

Here is a sample change that does a "force reload" every time.

myk, bdahl, can you try it and let me know if this helps?
I'm building with it now and will start using it afterward.  I'll use it for a few days before reporting back, since the problem is intermittent, so it's hard to be sure.

Ok, I've been using my custom build with this patch for a few days, and I haven't had the problem again, nor have I noticed any regressions.  So this patch seems to address the problem, and at the very least it doesn't seem iatrogenic.  I think we should take it!

Alex, should we just |force| reload like this in all cases, or make WebIDE on do so sometimes?

Hum it looks like the current production code usages of reload always use force=true.
(I mean the usages other than WebIDE ones, that are broken, per this bug)

So I think it is valuable to make it by default.
Only tests are calling reload without any argument, and I can easily imagine them failing because of that!
