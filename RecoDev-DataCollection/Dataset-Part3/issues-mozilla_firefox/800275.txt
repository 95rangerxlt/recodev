There isn't a need to remove elements from the array at each pass through the array. The array can just be cleared after the loop has finished.

A similar construct can be found here as well, https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/social/FrameWorker.jsm#359

I don't think we need this line anymore.

This line should just be |worker.pendingPorts.splice(0, worker.pendingPorts.length);|. The usage of |let| here will cause an error since the variable was already declared above.

Don't use 'for each' on arrays, use for..of instead.

This can be simplified to:

worker.pendingPorts.length = 0

or:

worker.pendingPorts = []

Yes, this looks perfect. Would you like to work on bug 800278 next?
I will check this in tomorrow to the mozilla-inbound repository. From there it will get merged to mozilla-central within a day or two where it will show up in our Nightly builds: http://nightly.mozilla.org

In less than six weeks, mozilla-central will become Aurora. Six weeks later it becomes Beta, then in another six weeks it will become Release.
> Yes, this looks perfect. Would you like to work on bug 800278 next?

Yes, I will work on it tomorrow.

Thanks for the explanation and the bug suggestion.
Pushed to mozilla-inbound:

We shouldn't hit this in the normal case, but it is probably a contributing factor in bug 802671 - proposing for 17 as it would reduce the impact of any other "port leaks" we have.
Oops, 802671 is only hit on worker creation - my faulty memory told me it was destruction.
