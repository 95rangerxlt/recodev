I've had problems before logging into gmail, but I can usually click on my gmail
bookmark again and it will continue on in. In this case, nothing I do makes any
difference. I always end up sitting at the "Loading..." page. Several other
users have encountered this problem, but after several searches, I was unable to
find their bug (if they filed one):

I'm sure most people who want one have them by now, but if anyone needs a gmail
account to test with, just let me know.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to http://gmail.google.com or https://gmail.google.com
2. Log in
3. See "Loading..." page


Actual Results:  
I grew old waiting to see my inbox

Expected Results:  
I should have been redirected to my inbox

I'm seeing this too (Aviary/build ID: 20050215 Firefox/1.0); could someone with
the right permissions confirm this so we can work on getting this fixed with 1.0.1?
I built Aviary 1.0.1 after Brendan's fix for jsinterp.c was checked in on
2005-02-16 at 16:38 and it now works for me.  Can be marked Resolved Fixed, I think.
Fixed in 20050216 build. Thanks Brendan.
