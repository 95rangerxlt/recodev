Where did you get the grey colors from?  Looks like you are looking for something lighter than the splitter color.  I guess we don't really have much here:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors.

I've often used splitter with alpha for this effect rgba(170, 170, 170, .5) or something.

Also, there is some extra whitespace at the end of this line
I used the colors from the inspector sidebar.
Should that be changed in another bug ?

OK I see that now (theme-separator).  That's fine - just reupload the patch with the trailing whitespace removed and push to try.
