Per gavin's suggestion to make it easier for the code to make sense in context. The end feature name might be different thought.

Move files and update references to tabview from tabcandy. Only remaining candy reference is the link to aza's webm video.
Mardak, this change affected a few user-facing strings as well (such as the menu name, and maybe a tooltip?). Also, looks like we're moving to "Tab Sets" as the external name (at least for now). Let's change the user-facing strings to "Tab Sets", leaving the internal name "TabView"; this will keep things consistent for now and make it easier to change in the future if/when needed.

Make sure user facing names refer to Tab Sets for now for bug 583044.
Mass moving all Tab Candy bugs from Mozilla Labs to Firefox::Tab Candy.  Filter the bugmail spam with "tabcandymassmove".
