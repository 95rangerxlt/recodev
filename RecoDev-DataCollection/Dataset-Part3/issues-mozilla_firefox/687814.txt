Steps to reproduce:

__SS_restoreState [TAB_STATE_NEEDS_RESTORE, TAB_STATE_RESTORING] is confusing with __SS_data._tabStillLoading. Maybe __SS_data._tabStillLoading can be eliminated eventually?

It proves they're for different purposes, but still confusing.
Want some clarification.
I agree, they probably are. We're going to remove __SS_tabStillLoading in bug 867097.
Fixed by bug 867097.
