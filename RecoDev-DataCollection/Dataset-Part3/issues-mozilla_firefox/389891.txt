Stupid mistake, patch coming

Checking in toolkit/mozapps/handling/content/dialog.js;
new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1
So, a good testcase would be something like:

1. Install a program that registers itself as the handler for a specific filetype (such as Winamp setting itself as the .pls filetype handler on Windows).
2. Download/open from a link the filetype from step #1.
3. The "Open With" dialog should pre-fill said application from step #1, and clicking "OK" from that dialog should open it in that application.

Right?
(or a local file, in step # 2; not just a remote URI).
no, it's for protocols, like webcal://

Basically, if you manually choose an app, it should be listed.  There was a typo that made it not listed next time it opened.
Litmus Triage Team: ctalbert, will you handle this test case?
