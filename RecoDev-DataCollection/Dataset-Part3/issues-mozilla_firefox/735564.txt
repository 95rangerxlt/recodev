Running a Windows 8 tablet - touch-screen, no mouse. The new tab page has on-hover UI (pin/unpin, forget) that doesn't work well with a touch-screen.

Current workaround is to start moving a thumbnail, drop it in it's original place, then hit one of the buttons.

Might be able to include a CSS media type for handheld which makes the buttons always visible?

@media handheld {
  .newtab-control {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

in /browser/base/content/newtab/newTab.css
That sounds like a good idea to me. I unfortunately don't have a handheld that runs default Firefox. Anyone willing to test this? Should I kick off a try build?
A tablet isn't a handheld. You want -moz-touch-enabled.

Verified on Fx13b6 20120528154913 on a touch screen machine with Windows 8 Consumer Preview. Previous builds do not show the pin/remove icons, but they always show on Fx13b6.
Thanks Juan.
