The picture above is, with activated colormanagement in FF, shown wrong (Lab picked with Apples Digital Color Meter is: 51|64|58, and shoult be something around 54|81|70). 
Open it again in Photoshop, paint something, save it again with Profile, shows something like that:
http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/sRGB_bemalt.jpg
Now the unpainted outer areas are shown in correct sRGB red.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/nur-rot_sRGB.jpg 
2. create Tab and open http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/sRGB_bemalt.jpg
3. download the two pictures and compare in an colormanaged Application.

Effect is even better to see, as the Monitor Gamma ist greater than sRGB, here is a Screenshot, showing the Difference in PS, Safari and FF: http://www.richard-ebv.de/images/HDS/reines_Rot_im_Vergleich.jpg
Actual Results:  
Allways the same ;-)

Expected Results:  
The Color of 'nur-rot_sRGB.jpg' should be the same as the REd in the outer areas of sRGB_bemalt.jpg

Showing correct sRGB like CIELab 54|81|70

I made tests with different Kompressions, baseline and progressive, opend the Picure from local and from the URLs above... all the same result.

Can you test that in the latest nightly build ?
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/
or the RC 1 builds
http://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases/Firefox_3.0rc1

This is probably dupe of bug 429915.

I'd read that, but there stood something about PNG and GIF.


The two images have the same shade of red when I viewed them together
with Firefox 3.0, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7pre on Windows XP and 3.6.2 on Ubuntu.

Can we close this bug as FIXED ?
Marking FIXED per comment #3 and a private communication from the reporter.
