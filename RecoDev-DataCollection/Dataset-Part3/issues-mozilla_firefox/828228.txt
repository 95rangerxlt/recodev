First prototype

As I'm not sure exactly what we want to measure, let's start with a first prototype.

First prototype

Seems fine to me. I can't think of other things to measure offhand, but I haven't thought of it much.

The descriptions in the histogram definitions should be unique :)

One other nit: I don't like using constants for short strings, like TELEMETRY_SERVICE_INIT/TELEMETRY_BUILD_CACHE - it's a level of indirection that makes the code harder to read/grep, and doesn't really serve a purpose (typos would be caught otherwise, and we don't need to change these values often).

This doesn't actually measure writing the file to disk. Should you put this stop() in the writeAtomic callback instead? Depends on what the intent is I guess.
I assumed that we didn't need that measure, because it's not on the critical path. We can always add a further measure later, I guess.
