Comments from dveditz during the security review of the Web Console:

Inspect Network Request panel

    we do seem to encode/escape data
    use <browser type="content> to reduce privilege
        except chrome:// is still privileged
        switch to a resource: template maybe?
        or maybe a special about: page (unprivileged, of course)
        create from scratch into a data: or about:blank document? 
    disable javascript and plugins on the docshell


Additional input from gavin:
we should use an iframe as we do with the inspector

that should be fairly easy to implement.

r=me, but might want to rename the property to "iframe" just for clarity, and change the two "browser" references in the comments for update().
Sounds good. Thanks!
