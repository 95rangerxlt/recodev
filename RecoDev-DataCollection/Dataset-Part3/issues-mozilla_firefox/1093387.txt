Several parts of the WebIDE connect to a runtime workflow fail to report useful errors and / or handle rejections, leading to unhelpful errors or no stacks when there is an issue.

Let's improve the error handling.

Dave, you mentioned seeing these issues.  If you have specific steps for the issue you are seeing, note them here, and I'll check them along with anything else I clean up.

This comment is a bit misleading.
You just want to ignore `initConnectionTelemetry` rejection, right?
While letting busyUntil handling connectToRuntime resolution.
If busyUntil listen for rejection, it will catch them.

Same thing here, you just want to ignore telemetry exceptions.

As discussed on IRC, this is because uncaught promise tracking doesn't realize these rejection are handled elsewhere.

I filed bug 1121100 for this, and add the bug to these comments.  Also, I fixed a test failure.
