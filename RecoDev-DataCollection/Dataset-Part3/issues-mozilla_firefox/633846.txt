fix

Once in browser-chrome, twice in chrome, we have tests that use www.mozilla.org as a bookmark test URI and then open the properties, triggering the microsummary requests mentioned in bug 626999 comment 3 as we check whether we should offer a Live Title to change to.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.
