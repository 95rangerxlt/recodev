When creating a new folder in bookmarks the program hangs, all you can see on the screen is a blank rectangle extending from the bookmarks menu to the bottom of the screen that stays there whatever you try to do. I'm unable to access anything in the program after that. The only way to quit is to force quit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Bookmarks
2.Click on Bookmark this page
3.Click the arrow next to Create in
4.Click on New Folder and create it and then click ok



Actual Results:  
Blank rectangle on screen and program not responding at all.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have carried on working as normal.

I'm running OS X 10.4.6 on a PPC G4 12 inch Powerbook
