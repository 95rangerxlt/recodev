In 1.8branch build, the Proxy setting of IE doesn't migrate from 2005-10-25. 
(The Proxy setting columns are all blanks.Till then, there was only a problem of bug266413.) 
And as for this problem, trunk reproduces.

You mean this regressed 2005-10-25?

If not, then this is a dupe of bug 297288

Yes, this is regressed.
It is not dup of bug297288. 

In 1.8branch build to 2005-10-24, the Porxy server name and port number, and Auto Proxy URL, all migrate. 
Possibly a regression from bug 313529. See also bug 316995.
Nominating for next release(es) since this might be a regression from mconner's latest migration code changes. Assigning to him for more investigation.

patch of trunk

In trunk, "RegKey" is used undefined. 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/migration/src/nsIEProfileMigrator.cpp#1872
In 1.8branch, because bug-org250255 is not corrected, logic is somewhat different. 
But  after the registry is opened with RegOpenKeyEx in place, it doesn't close. 

After the same key is open and is used in the following places, it doesn't close. 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/components/migration/src/nsIEProfileMigrator.cpp#1840
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/components/migration/src/nsIEProfileMigrator.cpp#1867

Does not the error occur when opening without closing the same key?

patch of 1.8branch

RegCloseKey is called at the right time.
well, are we taking 250255 on the branch (with this fix)

we should absolutely fix this in both places...

Patch of correct 1.8.0branch

Miss spelling Key -> key
In test build that applied patch to current source(trunk/MOZILLA_1_8BRANCH), the Proxy setting was correctly reflected. 

If bug266413 along with this problem doesn't do FIXED, Firefox cannot be&#12288;immediately used by setting IE migration. 

When setting migration of IE is executed, it is necessary to be able to use it without doing anything in the next release.

I'll ask for approval for landing of attachment 188853 with your fix in 1.8.1 branch so that you don't have to worry about making a separate branch fix. THanks anyway

checked-in. Thank you, Hiro-san.

Jungshik:

What do you think for branch?
Bug-org 250255 will go to 1.8.1 and 1.8.0.x?

Thanks for bringing that up. I forgot about that. I guess my patch will go in for 1.8.1 only. So, you may go ahead and ask for a1.8.0.2 for attachment 209651.

Because this had done checkin, 1.8branch NB Firefox was tried. 
But the item that had been defined as follows did not migrate. 
And Proxy and SSL too.

Homepage, cookie, and User Style Sheet did migrate.

Trunk vs 1.8 branch

This is diff between trunk and 1.8 branch.
I think that there is no problem...
I cannot reproduce this bug on 1.8 branch.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060207 Firefox/1.5

Hiro-san, please re-test it.
It tested again with following build.
But not migate...
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.8/firefox-1.5.en-US.win32.zip

In trunk build, no problem.

Yeah, I also made this diff and can't see anything that can possibly makes a difference between two as far as migrating proxy configuration is concerned.
This bug doesn't appear to be on the 1.8.0 branch, what problem is attachment 209651 trying to solve?
yeah, you're right. I cannot reproduce this problem on 1.8.0 branch too.
We don't have any checked-in to migrator code of 1.8.0 branch.

But Mozilla Japan has other same report from our partner company...
# Of course, on Fx1.5.

Hiro-san:

Can you reproduce this on 1.8.0 branch?
Oh, I understand. The problem doesn't occur by [File] -> [Import].
But I can reproduce this at clean installed first boot time(all profiles removed).

I can reproduce on 1.8 branch too. Comment 26 is right.
Daniel:

I confirmed that the first boot time importing problem is fixed by attachment 209651. Let's go to 1.8.0.2.
It's strange...

I tested on MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH CVS build. This bug is fixed on the build too. But the official nightly build(*) has this bug...

(*) I got from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.8/
This bug still exists when the build uses official branding.
I separated the issue to bug 327306.

Yeah, you're right. This is fixed by bug 327303.
*However*, I think that this is resource leak bug.
Should we fix this on 1.8.0.x, right?
