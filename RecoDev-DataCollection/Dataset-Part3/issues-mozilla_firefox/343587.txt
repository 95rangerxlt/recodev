what's a good toolkit.scrollbox.clickToScroll.scrollDelay default?

asaf suggested I ping the usual suspects for a recommendation.

this comes from bug #342906 where I've chosen a 200 ms slack timer.

asaf thinks 100 ms.

note, each time the timer fires (while you are clicking and holding the scroll button) we'll scroll a tab at at time.

This has to block if we're keeping the scroll buttons.
This won't block release, but if we can get some good consensus on a value we'd take the patch. Right now it seems somewhat pokey, but functional.
Having tested this a bit, I find that at 100ms it's hard to read the titles on the tabs as they go by. I played with numbers, and think that 150ms would be better.

fwiw: I'll try out 100 vs 150 ms and see if it feels better.

(ben / peter, can you try too?)

the patch would be trivial, so I'll whip it up.

no problem.  FWIW, 150 ms seems fine to me.

thanks for taking care of this and driving it in for 2.0b2.
