As far as I can tell, browser.startup.homepage_reset is not used and should be removed from browserconfig.properties. Tracking blame for this pref is hard given the aviary branch landing and poor record keeping (no patches, sometimes no bugs), though, so if anyone can remember how this was used in the past, that'd be useful for confirming that it's no longer needed.

iirc, this was used for the "reset Firefox homepage" bit in the installer, and no longer matters.
An MXR search doesn't turn up any results for homepage_reset and a separate MXR search for "browser.startup" doesn't return any results with anything that looks related to a "homepage reset".

I'm marking this as resolved-fixed. Please reopen or reclassify if I overlooked something or made this change in error.
I did find a mention of homepage_reset in the Seamonkey codebase though.

although this bug is for Firefox. CC'ing the Seamonkey folks to see if they have a plan of removing this from their codebase.

No, that's actually Firefox 3.0 code you're looking at there.
