Why not use black text. To give the feeling of "BLACK"boxing.

I don't really feel qualified to review this, handing to paul.  In particular, I think that GrayText might change per-platform and not necessarily look great with our theming?
How about we keep the same color for the text and instead change the background color/gradient of the source in the source list to a dark/black color, thus signifying "blackbox" ?

FWIW, we use GrayText in the breadcrumbs.
I think we should both change the background and gray out or italicize the text.

Like Dave said, GrayText is platform and theme dependent, when the background color is not. So it's better to hard code the value here.

* No more GrayText, we use #666 (so metal)

* Italic text

* Not sold on the background changes

I'm not sure I like my "let's italicize the text" idea anymore. Looks cheap. How about simply going for "color: #888;" and be done with it? It looks good to me (using #666 makes it very hard to read imho) r+ with this change if you agree.
