This is currently basically disabled (the distance is set to 1px), so it provides minimal to no benefit. Actually, it might make things a little bit slower because of the extra conditional and math done on every point in the data source.

I suggest removing this. It can only make a small difference in 10 minute long recordings, and at that point there's other much bigger problems to solve.
