Currently we only list rules (selectors) for the property the user expanded. We also list element.style ... to show the property value of the element the user has highlighted. This way we take into consideration element.style properties from the highlighted element.

Still, we are missing values given to the inspected property (say color) from the parent elements. For example:

<body style="color: blue">
<p>hello world!</p>
</body>

The blue value for the color property does not show in the current Style panel. We need a way to present this information to the user.

One way would be to show the short name of each parent element like this:

BODY[0] → blue

The status we show on the right column is of dispute. We can't show "parent match", because it's not a rule selector that matched one of the parent elements. Nor can we show "inherited" because the color:blue property on BODY is not inherited from some other parent - it's set *there*. (notice the semantical and logical factors coming into play). Suggestions for a better status name? We could use a status like "LOCAL RULE", "LOCAL STYLE", "LOCAL PROPERTY" or simply "LOCAL". This would be then displayed for the row that shows the highlighted element.style, and for the rows that show the property value from each parent element.

Additionally, we need to think of the UI matter: we want to remove the right column that displays the status. Limi will prepare some mockups which use better styling for conveying the status.

Just making a note that Joe and Mihai think that this will not require any new strings.
Correct. No new strings used. I have implemented this in bug 589849. If we switch to that code, we can mark this issue as fixed.
