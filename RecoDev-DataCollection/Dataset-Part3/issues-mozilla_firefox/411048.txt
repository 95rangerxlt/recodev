I found this bug when I was working on bug 349913...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page which provides more than one feed (such as <http://www.mozilla.org/>).
2. From the Bookmarks menu, under Subscribe to This Page, middle-click on one of the feeds.  The feed opens in a new tab.
3. Switch to the original tab.
4. Click on the Bookmarks menu, and be careful not to hover any of its menu items.
Actual Results:  
The Subscribe to This Page menu item is highlighted.

Expected Results:  
None of the menu items should be highlighted.

This happens both in beta 2 and the latest nightly.

I checked the window using DOM Inspector, and I figured that menu item has the "open" and "_moz-menuactive" attributes after the menu is dismissed by the middle-click.

Relevant code to check out:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=/mozilla/browser/base/content/utilityOverlay.js&rev=1.58&mark=240,258,263-272#240>

I suspect there's something wrong with the closeMenus implementation, because if the test case is followed only by clicking with the left button (which dismisses the menu through XUL widget code) everything works as it should...

This is a regression, because the same test case works as expected in Firefox 2.
This regressed from bug 279703 (I've lost the bonsai link).

clear active state when destroying menu frame

This is because the menu is being hidden, so the frame gets destroyed, before there is a chance to dehighlight the menu. Here, we explicity clear the active state on the menu when it is destroyed.

clear active state when destroying menu frame

I hope anyone doesn't rely on mutation events for _moz_menuactive ;-)

clear active state when destroying menu frame

Not perfect because of not firing mutation event, but not sure what else could be done here.

clear active state when destroying menu frame

This patch is pretty small (minus the test) and low-risk, and fixes a nuisance; requesting approval.

Landed this in time for the freeze. Hope that's ok...
