I don't think this happened yesterday when I was working on this test (browser_markupview_tag_edit_03.js), so it must have been something that landed later in the day, perhaps bug 1139644.

In any case, it's not a big issue, just errors in the logs, the test still passes.
Here's the error:

console.error:
  Message: TypeError: this._inspector.toolbox is null
  Stack:
    MarkupView.prototype._hideBoxModel@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource:///modules/devtools/markupview/markup-view.js:316:5

I'm guessing the SDK setTimeout call still fires even after the markup view window was destroyed but the old setTimeout never did?  https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/fb06cbc42442#l1.121

We should probably be clearing any active timeouts throughout that file in relevant destroy functions.
