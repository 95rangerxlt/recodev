Bing has an API to access the quota. Unfortunately, it requires getting an OAuth token first which makes using it in a script significantly more difficult than one would hope.

The relevant API is http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh973151.aspx we are interested in the ResourceBalance value.

xpcshell script to fetch the quota from the Bing API
Created attachment 8468771
HTML page to display a chart

Here is how I installed these files on people.mozilla.org:

$ crontab -l
0,30 * * * * /bin/bash /home/fqueze2/bing-quota/quota.sh

$ cat bing-quota/quota.sh 
#!/bin/bash

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/fqueze2/bing-quota/firefox /home/fqueze2/bing-quota/firefox/xpcshell /home/fqueze2/bing-quota/quota.js >> /home/fqueze2/public_html/bing-quota/quota.txt


The resulting chart is visible at: https://people.mozilla.org/~fqueze2/bing-quota/
The raw data is at http://people.mozilla.org/~fqueze2/bing-quota/quota.txt

HTML page to display a chart of characters per hour

I tweaked attachment 8468771 a bit to make a chart of the characters translated per hour instead of the evolution of the quota, as I was curious to see how the usage varies between hours of the day and between days.

The result is visible at https://people.mozilla.org/~fqueze2/bing-quota/usage.html
