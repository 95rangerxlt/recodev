The build you reported this bug on is over a month old, a lot of things
are fixed during that time span. I recommend you download the latest nightly
build and install it with a fresh profile, then post the results to this bug. :)

I tried it with latest build, still having problems, (but diffrent problems)
with calender, gives message which says ICAL component is not registered
properly...  bug id: 134432. So I am resolving it myself.
