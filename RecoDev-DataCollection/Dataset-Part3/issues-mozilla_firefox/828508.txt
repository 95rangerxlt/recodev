depending on the fix this could be fixed by bug 795495
The affected platform should be All, not just Mac OSX, and it should block Bug 820679.
I just noticed that there are certain websites whose favicon *is* shows at retina resolution in Firefox, but most of them aren't.  E.g. https://bitbucket.org/  Does it depend on how the favicon is specified?
most of the icons are rescaled to 16x16 internally, so they can't be at 2xDPI.
It looks like we don't handle cases where favicon.ico contains multiple versions of the icon at different sizes - we just use the 16x16 version, even when there is a 32x32 version present. We ought to be able to fix that.

The bitbucket site only has a small image in its favicon.ico, but the HTML includes:
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://d3oaxc4q5k2d6q.cloudfront.net/m/781fb77c3b12/img/favicon.png">
which points to a 32x32 version of its favicon; apparently we do recognize that.
There is the same problem on Android.

WIP i1 - makes tab favicons HiDPI when available, but not bookmark/history favicons

Tiny patch that makes Firefox use 32x32 favicons for the tabs when available, but doesn't work for bookmarks & history.

Also, the concatenation of "#-moz-resolution=32,32" needs to be altered to handle existing '#' characters in the URI.
Instead of sniffing out min-resolution: 2dppx, you should scale the desired icon size by window.devicePixelRatio so that other pixel ratios work.

use larger favicons in hidpi mode if available

Modified your patch to handle other scaling factors, as per Greg's comment, and leave it up to the icon decoder to pick the best matching size (I'm going to post a followup to bug 419588 to prefer downscaling larger icons rather than upscaling smaller ones). Going to try this on windows to see how the results look at 125% and 150% resolution scales...
This seems to work well on Windows, provided we adjust the icon decoder to favor giving us a -larger- icon to be downscaled rather than a smaller one that needs to be upscaled to the requested size; see bug 854441.

Would changing Math.round to Math.ceil work just as well?
We could, but it wouldn't make much difference. The main issue is that if the (rounded) size we want is (say) 20px, but the file only contains 16px and 32px, we want to choose the 32px version - i.e. the issue there isn't one of integer rounding direction.

(And we don't want to apply round() or ceil() to the devicePixelRatio itself, before multiplying, as there's no guarantee that the available sizes are restricted to integer multiples of 16px.)

Applying ceil to devicePixelRatio is what I meant, but you're right.
Thanks for working on this. :)

This should fix the favicons in tab titles on Retina Macs, and on Windows once bug 854441 lands.

We'll still need to do something for other places where favicons are used (bookmarks, history - see comment 7). I suggest we let those be handled by followup bugs, for easier tracking of what's fixed and what isn't.
Backed out for causing browser-chrome test bustage like:
https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=21078596&tree=Mozilla-Inbound

It's possible that this didn't cause all the bustage in that log, but it's definitely responsible for the first one:
{
WARNING -  TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug477014.js |  - Got data:image/png;base64,iV...ggg==#-moz-resolution=16,16&-moz-resolution=16,16, expected data:image/png;base64,iV..ggg==
}

I stripped out most of the giant data URI there. The relevant differnece between "Got" and "expected" is the -moz-resolution=16,16 suffix that this bug added.

Not sure if that's a bug in the test or in the code, but either way, it needs fixing before this can re-land.

(Also, it seems a bit odd that the data URI has two copies of the -moz-resolution thing -- "#-moz-resolution=16,16&-moz-resolution=16,16".  That doesn't seem to be what's breaking the test, but it looks like a bug that'd be worth fixing)
Sorry -- forgot to include the URI of the backout cset. It's:
  https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/02547d0a4402
Argh - sorry, didn't think about tests that explicitly compare the icon as a data uri.

AFAICS there are two possible approaches to this: either we modify the affected tests so that they explicitly include the -moz-resolution media fragment in the expected result (adjusted for window.devicePixelRatio), or know to ignore it when comparing; or else we modify the getIcon method in tabbrowser.xml so that it returns the icon URL without this media fragment.

I think the latter makes more sense; we should consider the use of #-moz-resolution (here, at least) to be something that's purely an internal implementation detail of tabbrowser's icon handling. We don't include this in the URL that's passed to setIcon, so we shouldn't expect it to come back out of getIcon either.

I'll run this idea through tryserver to see if it makes things happier, and if so will post an updated patch for re-review.

use higher-res favicons for tab titles in hidpi mode if available.

Updated the patch to avoid "leaking" the -moz-resolution media fragment out of tabbrowser through the getIcon API or to onLinkIconAvailable listeners. This prevents it messing up various testcases that have specific expectations about the icon URL. Also avoids the case where multiple -moz-resolution fragments get appended, which occurred when the icon was copied from one browser element to another and so passed through setIcon multiple times. This seems to pass tests locally; sent to tryserver for confirmation: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=da300d3dcdc7.

Use let instead of var here.

You should call remoteBrowser.getIcon(aOtherTab) here.

On second thought, this looks like a better solution. Instead of adding the resolution media fragment to mIconURL, we can leave that property untouched, and just add the media fragment when actually setting the image attribute on the tab. This is simpler and cleaner. Also pushed this version to tryserver, to check for surprises (looking good in local testing)... https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=86cf94d2af56.

>             if ((browser.mIconURL || "") != aTab.getAttribute("image")) {

This check doesn't work anymore since you're adding #-moz-resolution to the 'image' attribute but not to mIconURL. You could fix that by stripping off #-moz-resolution before doing the comparison.
Good catch, thanks - so we'd end up redundantly re-setting the attribute. I think I'd prefer to fix it by including the resolution fragment in the URL that we compare to the current image attribute. That way, re-setting the icon after a change in screen resolution will work properly, whereas otherwise the "stale" icon could persist more stubbornly.

Obsoleting the older patch that included -moz-resolution in mIconURL, as that leads to a messier solution overall.

The parentheses can be dropped.

if (sizedIconUrl) {

if (sizedIconUrl) {

Also, the curly brackets can be dropped (you're not using them after 'else' either).
Thanks for the quick review. I'll wait for tryserver results to confirm mochitest-bc is green before cleaning up and pushing this.

(fryn, if you have any other comments - as you started the work in this bug - feel free to weigh in, otherwise I'll go ahead with dao's review.)
Cleaned up as per comment 26, and pushed:
https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/93cbcd7f34b3

I've filed bug 854956 about the favicons that appear in bookmarks and awesomebar results (i.e. things that come from Places).

No, this is fine. :)

You're probably seeing the effect of bug 1121802. Make sure you favicon has a .ico extension to work around this.
The do have .ico as the extension, but I did find the real culprit:

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="~/favicon.ico?1" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" />

I placed a ?1 after the .ico to force invalidate the cache. (I often do this with CSS as well.) By removing the ?1, the high-res favicon works once again.
