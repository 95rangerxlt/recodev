Previously, www.mozilla.com was merged into www.mozilla.org. The .com website was the promotional product site and .org was the foundation website. Now that they are combined, there are all sorts of legacy redirects.

www.mozilla.com 301 redirects to www.mozilla.org/firefox/

www.mozilla.com/foo/ 301 redirects to www.mozilla.org/foo/

The preferences file is here:

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/993d7aff3109/browser/branding/official/pref/firefox-branding.js

Some of the URLs in Firefox code will cause 404's and others will not. For example, this URL will not 404:

www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/releases/

But it will 301 redirect to:

www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/

It is a not a 404, but we are waiting another request to the different URL for the redirect.

Can we get all www.mozilla.com instances in our Firefox products updated to www.mozilla.org?

Here's a full list of such references:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=www.mozilla.com&find=browser%2F

For the most part, I think we will just want to replace the current URLs with their (non-locale-specific) redirect target, but we'll need to audit every change carefully to ensure that we don't break links or locale auto-detection.
The redirect is set up that any URL that follows www.mozilla.com/[locale]/foo will redirect to www.mozilla.org/[locale]/foo. The root of www.mozilla.com redirects to www.mozilla.org/firefox/.

Changing www.mozilla.com to www.mozilla.org in Firefox code should not cause any more problems than the current redirect causes. Changing .com to .org and keeping the rest of the URL is exactly what the current www.mozilla.com redirect does now. 

Changing this URL just saves an extra redirect since www.mozilla.com has not existed for over a year.

Yep, but I'm just saying that while we're going to go through all of these URLs anyways, we should make sure that their destinations are optimal. That might involve more changes than just s/com/org/.

I've asked Raymond/Andres from appcoast if they can help us with this (and bug 771788), I wrote up an action plan here: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/firefox-product-url-updates
Totally agree. We should make sure that where we are sending people now even makes sense. :)

Can I schedule a meeting for us to review the URLs and verify where they should go? I am heading to sxsw march 8-13 and it may have to be after I get back. Who should I invite to the meeting from the Firefox side?

Please see the bottom of https://etherpad.mozilla.org/firefox-product-url-updates which contains all redirect chains

This patch just changes mozilla.com to mozilla.org.  Will wait to see the final urls after the review meeting.

This seems like rather old content. We should probably get a bug on file on freshening it up.

Hmm, these links are broken now (they don't point to the 3.0 robot pages) :( I suppose you should just remove them.

Is converting many of these links to https covered by another bug?

Removed them

Do you mean that we want to convert all http://www..mozilla.org to https?  We just have bug 841221 and bug 841221 for some of them.
Gavin/Raymond: Since we are going to making changes to the www.mozilla.org links in the Firefox desktop product, can you check out bug 876427 that our Web Analytics engineer filed? Currently, any traffic that comes from the browser is considered "direct traffic" and there is no way to tell if this came from a 301 redirect, typing in a URL, or a bookmark. If there were UTM tags on in-product links, it would help segment the traffic to know how well those in-product links are being used. Comment in bug 876427 with your thoughts.

Can you file a Firefox::General bug about making this use a pref, rather than being hardcoded in the XUL?

I think we should take this opportunity to also change all of the www.mozilla.org links that you're updating to use https.
