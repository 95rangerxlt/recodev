This is likely from installing the 0.9 RC build on top of an old build.  You
must either install new builds in a new directory, or erase the old build before
installing.
If this was installed on an old build, this bug should be duped to bug 245980.
I am getting the same error.  I have not installed Firefox before.
I would imagine this was fixed in 0.9.1?  If so, please state as such.

Thanks
Yes, It has been fixed
