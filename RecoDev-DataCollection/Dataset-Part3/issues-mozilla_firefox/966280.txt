So, I wasn't sure whether to do it this way (which has the advantage of having no dependencies), or to check the TabsInTitlebar.enabled flag (which depends on browser.js), or to check the tabsintitlebar attribute on the document (which depends on the document).  I've obviously gone with this approach, but am happy to change it to better fit in with the other things we're checking.

Thanks!
