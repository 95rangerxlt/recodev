I confirm on Windows that 15.0, 16.0a2, or 18.0a1 don't start with the -private option if the profile is already in permanent browsing mode.
It's a regression since Firefox 4 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110330 Firefox/4.2a1pre).

Suspected bug:
Ehsan Akhgari â€” Bug 631973 - Opening Firefox in permanent private browsing mode opens an additional window with the home page; r=gavin
CCing some people who might be interested in looking into this crash.
When I tested the regression on Win 7, I met no crash, Firefox just refused to start.
On Linux x64, I got "Program exited normally.". Tried again and get "WARNING: Last startup was detected as a crash.: file /scratch/laden/mozilla-central/toolkit/components/startup/nsAppStartup.cpp, line 1017"
It would be worth figuring out whether bug 631973 is responsible. Try the steps at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10350661/backout-unwanted-changes-and-make-a-patch-out-of-them to create a patch that reverts the change from that bug, build and see the the problem is still present.
Yep, it does seem like bug 631973 is indeed responsible.

Thanks for the analysis!  Can you please try and see if you can fix this?  Thanks!

Bug 786897 - Command line option -private crashes, if privacy mode is enabled in preferences.

Testing locally with a clean profile seems to indicate that this fixes the issue.

Oops, the autostarted part is needed for the tests.

Looks good.  Please also add a comment saying that we don't need to go into PB mode a second time if we're in auto-started mode.

Please attach so that we can land this.  :-)
