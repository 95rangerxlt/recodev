STR:
1) Install the add-on Exif Viewer 2.00
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/exif-viewer/ (restart to apply)
2) Open a random picture in a tab like
https://blog.mozilla.org/press/files/2012/04/Tristan_Nitot.jpg
3) Right click on the picture and select the entry "View Rotated Image (Exif)"


Expected:
Nightly should open a chrome:// window with the picture inside and some blue buttons in the top-right corner (zoom, rotation, close etc).

Result:
No chrome:// window is open and error in the browser console:
NS_ERROR_FAILURE:  overlay.js:186

Thanks for reporting this Exif problem, Loic! I'll update arewee10syet.com's list of addons.
hi Alan, if you have any questions about add-on support for multiprocess Firefox (e10s), just drop by the #e10s IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org. MDN also has a good introduction:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox
The developer has been contacted through AMO.
The rotation buttons don't appear correctly (unicode blocks), but it appears to be working otherwise for me.
I can confirm the add-on is functional. It was probably fixed with the new shims. It doesn't appear to be actively worked on, so this is likely as good as it gets.
