Marketplace has changed the category names, let's keep them in sync with Firefox.

For the future, it would be good to make changes simultaneously.

Indeed, but the installer code should also guard against unknown categories, so it isn't possible for the Marketplace to break app installation.

Erm, I've been approved to review code in webapprt/, but I don't think I've been approved to review code in toolkit/webapps/.  I don't see a submodule for it in https://wiki.mozilla.org/Toolkit/Submodules, though, so I don't know who it's reviewers are.

mossop: who's the right reviewer for this change?

I've been considering toolkit/webapps as part of the webapps module, though I now see that doesn't exist, maybe it should. Either way I'm happy for you to review this code.

We considered that when creating the desktop webapp runtime (in the top-level webapprt/ directory) but decided to make it part of the Firefox module:

The problem was that the Marketplace wasn't using the API correctly, they were passing integers as categories instead of strings (see bug 876293 comment 20). We could guard on this condition too and just ignore the category field, but I think the error message in the console is enough (passing an integer as a category should be a slightly uncommon mistake).
