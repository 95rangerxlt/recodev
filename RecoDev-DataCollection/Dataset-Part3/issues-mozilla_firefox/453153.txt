The "SVG in Firefox" status page
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG_in_Firefox
is incorrect.

For example, it claims that Firefox supports all the attributes of the SVG text and tspan elements except for "rotate", "textLength" and "lengthAdjust".  But "baseline-shift" is not supported:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308338

Other vertical alignment attributes (e.g. alignment-baseline) also seem to be unsupported.


Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
The status page should show what is actually supported.

It's a wiki. Why don't you just fix it?
By the way baseline-shift is not an attribute, it is a CSS property. The claims on the wiki are correct, if incomplete.
Are you sure it's not an attribute (as well as a CSS property)?

For example, the tspan DTD
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#TSpanElement
includes attributes from SVG.TextContent.attrib
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#id5192090
which includes baseline-shift.

I didn't realise it was a wiki.  If you're happy that it is an attribute I'll go ahead and update it (and http://developer.mozilla.org/En/Mozilla_SVG_Status).
Well OK, it's a CSS property which is also exposed as a presentation attribute.

SVG does, however have sets of ordinary attributes which are listed after each element e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#TextElement The wiki is talking about attributes rather than presentation attributes. Confusing isn't it :-)

Feel free to add to the wiki to list missing presentation attributes. You want an additional line 

unimplemented presentation attributes:

or alternatively

unimplemented CSS properties:

use whichever you prefer, just as long as you don't bung them into the attribute list.
I've updated it as you suggested.
