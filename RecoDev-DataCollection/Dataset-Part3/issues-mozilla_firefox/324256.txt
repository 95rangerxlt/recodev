Bug 308396 made some changes to the Tabs preferences:

"Open links from other applications in" and "Force links that open new windows to open in" have been merged into "Open links that would open new windows in". (The "a new tab in the most recent window" has been removed, but we haven't documented that anyway).

In the "open in new tabs" case, when you close a tab which was opened by clicking on a link with target="_blank" or by a script, you return to the last tab you were looking at, called the 'owner' tab, instead of the next adjacent tab, as it used to be.
Phew.

Each tab now has its own close button except when there are too many tabs. No need to document that.

Sorry can I confirm what you're saying there? Are you saying the ability to open links from other applications in a new tab has been removed?

Like this?
I don't think we need to document which tabs get focussed when you close the current tab. That would be a complicated explanation, and it should feel pretty natural anyway.
Jeff, can you spare a minute and look at this patch, please? And on the one in bug 325690 as well?

patch v1

I've been hideously hosed recently with classes, so sorry about the delay.

I think this looks okay, but to be completely honest I haven't really used any sort of trunk or 2.0 build very much at all, so I'm assuming things are correct based on a reading of the source code.  I really, really need to start running builds from the 2.0 branch soon. :-\
Just download a nightly :-)
They're pretty ok except if you're used to the bookmarks sidebar, in which case you need the Classic Sidebars extension (http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=391625).
