I've been trying to debug this but I'm absolutely lost as to what's eating our event. The event handler isn't called, in any case. The keypress event handler in tabbrowser.xml is, but it doesn't cancel the event or do anything with it. So somewhere inbetween there and the deck, things break. OTOH, making the listener use a captive event listener didn't help (assuming addEventListener("keypress", this, true) is supposed to work just like it would for a normal handler). :-\

esc key doesn't work anymore after clicking restore defaults,

And then it hit me... the keypress after clicking 'restore defaults' fires on the main window, because that's what gets focused (as the button becomes disabled, the focus manager changes focus to the window), and so the event doesn't get to the deck at all. The tabbrowser.xml handler gets it because its listener is attached to the document. We should be doing the same. This fixes the issue.
