Amazon and IMDb videos are currently broken (bug 1150189 and bug 1164013). Tobias says IMDb is now using HLS video, repacking into MP4 in Flash. Amazon is probably doing something similar.

Since the Shumway team's current focus is Flash ads, not videos, we should just remove Amazon and IMDB from our shumway.swf.whitelist pref since this seems to be a content change, not a Shumway regression.

See bug 1137433 for the code where IMDb was added to the shumway.swf.whitelist pref.

Please notice that pref entry shall exist and be set to the non-empty value. I suggest "http://www.areweflashyet.com/*".

Replace the Amazon/IMDb whitelist with the whitelist that Yury recommended in comment 1, but include a "*.swf" suffix because that is pattern format that was used for the Amazon/IMDb patterns. It's also Shumway's default whitelist for platforms that don't support platform video decoders:

Excellent, thank you!

I filed bug 1168761 for removing some special-casing in our code.
