Test environment:
Bon Echo nightly build 20060721, no screen reader needed.
Test done on IBM T42 ThinkPad, with Screen Resolution 1024x768 pixels using High Contrast #1 (extra large).

Description:  
When multiple tabs are opened, the little "Arrow" buttons on either side of the tabs are not both visible. (Sometimes one of the arrow icons, either left or right, is visible, but usually there is only a blank space visible, but you must actually click on the button before you see the arrow graphic.)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set High Contrast #1 (extra large) mode.  This can be set in Windows Control Panel,  Accesibility Options dialog, on the Display page.
2. Open several tabbed paged in Firefox using (ctrl+t), until the arrow buttons display on either side of the Web page tabs.  Notice that at least one of the arrow buttons displays as a black box, with no arrow graphic visible.

Expected Result:
The arrow graphics should be visible in high contrast / large font mode.

Minusing with the expectation that the new presentation for these scroll arrows to be delivered by jgoldman and mglenn will behave better than these temporary arrows.
Looks like the new tabstrip fixes this problem (both arrows are visible in High Contrast), but it also looks like the tabstrip doesn't work properly in High Contrast mode (this is the first time I've ever even heard of it :) ). Suggest we close this box as being fixed and open a new one on the rest of the tabstrip?
Update: With Bon Echo nightly build 20060814, I still see the reported problems, Jay the righthand arrow is visual but ONLY when shifting over to the right. So the statement "Looks like the new tabstrip fixes this problem (both arrows are visible in High Contast" is incorrect. I would also like to mention that the down arrow on the righthand side is also not visable anytime.
wayne, if you try tomorrows build, this should be better, and possibly fixed due to the fix for bug #352320. (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=238086)

but, as for this issue:

> I would also like to mention that the down arrow on the righthand side 
> is also not visable anytime.

I just hit this myself with the alltabs button (while working on bug #352321).  arrow-dn.gif is not transparent, so this horks us in the all tabs button, as well as the arrow down for the back and fwd button.

note, there is a arrow-down.png in the tree that appears transparent, and we might be able to use that to solve part of these problems.

also on a related note, see bug #143522.

ignore me, that png is of no help.  I've spun this issue out to bug #352479, which is blocked by #352477.

the solid back arrow-dn.gif is the root of the problem
marking as fixed, tracking remaining issues in bug 352479.
