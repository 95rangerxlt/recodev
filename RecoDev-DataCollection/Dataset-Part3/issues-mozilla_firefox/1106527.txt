This isn't really an e10s bug at all.

*** Bug 1123156 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
This doesn't look like a bug, it looks like a request that we re-design the page loading spinner. Is there a UX or design person we can ask to do this? 

Or, if we don't have concrete plans to create a new spinner, we should either close this or remove m8 tracking flag and change it to + for post-release work.
Yep, that is an issue. The current spinner (and the frequency at which it is displayed) can cause e10s Firefox to feel slower than non-e10s Firefox. We obviously don't want that.

And since we now have a timeline to ship e10s, it's becoming kinda urgent.

Are there any restrictions on what we can show in the »tab busy« state, or could it essentially be anything that we can build with HTML/CSS?

This is currently handled by css controlled by a property we set on the tab. We should stick with something light weight like this. We should avoid loading a separate document.

WIP patch

Thanks for the clarification!
I figured out a good way to de-emphasize the spinner while not getting rid of it completely.

An even better experience would be fading in the spinner after a few ms delay. Unfortunately I wasn't able to test that with my limited knowledge of the Firefox code base, but perhaps you could help me out here :)

WIP patch

A couple issues:

- When this showed up I had to look for it. At first all I picked up on was a blank grey tab.
- The spinner was at the bottom of the tab and as such at the very bottom of the window. Easy to miss.

Overall I'm not seeing this as an improvement. I am not a ux person on the desktop team though so I can't sign off here anyway.

That's exactly the point :)
The main point of the spinner is to show the user that the browser/tab has not frozen. That being said, whenever a user notices the spinner we are communicating that something takes time and we are effectively making them watch the clock. So the spinner should be discoverable when a user starts wondering whether something is wrong, but as little in your face as possible.

That's also why I asked about the ability to fade in the spinner. In the first few milliseconds of a blank screen, won't hurt too much, but if loading takes more than, say, half a second we want to have something that shows that the tab is not broken.

But why? People were fine without an annoying spinner that just eats up a little more of the resource for more than a decade. Why is the sudden need for a spinner every time I open a new tab?
And why a white page by the way? A black one is less aggressive. O:)

That's a very different thing. The spinner we're talking about here has nothing to do with loading pages, but with switching tabs when process separation (e10s) is enabled.

Taking a casual look through the Alexa top 100 sites, most of them have white (or bright) backgrounds, so the transition from unloaded to loaded is more natural when starting with white in most cases.

I know, that's what I was talking about. With my test profile (which I split from my main profile) most times I get the in-content spinner when I open a new tab. It's annoying
@phlsa thank you ;)

Which is better, a blank tab that makes the browser look like it's frozen or an animated graphic indicating something is happening? I'd go for the spinner. However I am not a UX person, and I think you are, so if you want to take the spinner out, go for it provided you get the right sign off on the patch from whoever is in charge of Fx UX.

From what I remember when we've experimented around with heavy animations for progress (fennec load indicator, desktop tab progress) animated elements have a bad habit of hurting load perf. That said with e10s a lot of the page load weight has been off lifted to the content process so maybe the impact will be less. We should find a way to test this.
I was thinking about this last night and I think I understand what you're going for in moving this down to the bottom of the window.

I have a large display with windows that rarely take up the screen but they do tend to be tall (~1400px on a 1600px display). With your patch the spinner isn't noticeable for me. Maybe the size of this graphic should be based on the size of content rather than set at a fixed width and height?
Please consider about high resolution spinner for HiDPI screen.
Picking this up again after a while...

After speaking with a few other members of the UX team, we should do a combination of two things:

1) When the spinner is showing, it should be more subtle, but we can keep it at the center. A spec is here: http://phlsa.github.io/fx-e10s-spinner/v2.html and the source code is here: https://github.com/phlsa/fx-e10s-spinner/blob/gh-pages/v2.html

2) The most annoying thing about the current version is when it briefly flashes when switching tabs. IIRC, we already keep showing the content of the previously selected tab for a few milliseconds if the content process isn't ready to display the new tab yet. We should increase that time to up to 400ms, which should get rid of a lot of the flashing.

NI Stephen for confirmation/review.

Looks nice! Suggested changes work for me.

opted to generate a new animated png for the spinner from preloaders.net (where the original one came from) to avoid doing a scale operation.
