I think this is breaking Valence. I can't connect to desktop Chrome with Nightly, but DevEdition works fine, for the same version of Valence.
Bug 1126432 is sharing and reusing app-manager.js in ways it was not expecting.

We'll need to change a few things to ensure it's always init()ed properly.

Define _initialized and _uninitialized outside of init/uninit to ensure AppManager doesn't get deoptimized by the JIT to dictionary mode.

Okay, fixed!

Turns out that using separate flags is a terrible idea, since this module is a singleton that gets re-inited later.  So, I've also condensed to one flag.
