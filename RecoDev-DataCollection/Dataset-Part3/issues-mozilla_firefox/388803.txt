The Solaris 10 2.0.0.5 release downloaded from the mozilla page (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0.0.5/contrib/solaris_tarball/firefox-2.0.0.5.en-US.solaris10-sparc.tar.bz2)  is missing the following libraries:

libfreebl_32fpu_3.chk
libfreebl_32fpu_3.so
libfreebl_32int64_3.chk
libfreebl_32int64_3.so
libfreebl_32int_3.chk
libfreebl_32int_3.so

the result is bugzilla bug id #368967. You get the "Could not initialize the browser's security component ..." dialog every time you try to start up the application. The quick fix is to use the files from the previous 2.0.0.4 dist but a new dist should be corrected/rebuilt for distribution.

I made my own build on Solaris 10.
It works fine.

So it's a package issue I think.

the change between 2.0.0.4 and 2.0.0.5 we made is the directory in which we ran make to generate bits tarball, that caused file missed in bits tarball. We will take a further look at why the file missed if running make in browser/installer
2.0.0.4: xpinstall/packager/
2.0.0.5: browser/installer/

To fix this problem, we regenerated bits tarball in xpinstall/packager, and already uploaded them on server.


FYI, I downloaded and installed the new dist (firefox-2.0.0.5.en-US.solaris10-respin-sparc.tar.bz2) and nothing happens now. Just get a command line back, no errors, no nothing ...

Mike, it works for me.

Perhaps you need to kill all firefox-bin behind first.
Use pkill -9 firefox-bin
