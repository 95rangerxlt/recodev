Reproduced with Firefox 34 beta 9, Dev Edition 35.0a2 and Nightly 36.0a1 2014-11-17 under Win 7 64-bit.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open WebIDE using a profile where simulators were previously installed
2. Connect to any simulator
3. When it is opened, select another simulator from the list

Expected results:
Selected simulator opens

Actual results:
2/3. The simulator is opened, but the following message is displayed on "Troubleshooting" section: Operation timed out: connecting to runtime Firefox OS x.y
Browser console:
"Connection status changed: connecting" app-manager.js:100
"Operation timed out: connecting to runtime Firefox OS 2.0" webide.js:316:4
UI.reportError() webide.js:316
UI.setupBusyTimeout/this._busyTimeout<() webide.js:258

I've seen this behavior too.  It feels like the simulator takes longer to open and listen for a connection, but I don't there were any simulator changes.

We could just bump WebIDE's timeout to work around it, but my guess some code change in WebIDE is making this slower somehow.

It should not be affected by simulator versions, but test with 2.2 to ensure consistent results.

Hoping someone can find a regression window, or else I can try when I get some time.
I've the with all the version of simulator with the firefox developer edition.
Also with the app manager the simulator window is opened but is black and from the app manager result not connected.
The issue reproduces with 2.2 simulator too.

I suspect bug 1055011.

> I suspect bug 1055011.

I was hoping it would be something more "interesting" than the one where we lowered the timeout... :(

Petruta, in comment 0 you say it also affects Firefox 34, but bug 1055011 is not in 34.  Is it perhaps a different problem then?

In the mean time, I'll up the timeout at least.

I just tried to reproduce on Firefox 34 beta 11. I encountered the message once, but that time the simulator failed to open. It could have been a different problem there, but it's not easy to catch it. I'll update if I'll have new info.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Bug 1055011
[User impact if declined]: Users will see a "connection timeout" in WebIDE, even though the connection will eventually succeed.  Bug 1055011 set a timeout that was a bit too low.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]: m-c
[Risks and why]: Low, just changing a timeout value.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/b2570a8f6e91
I'm using the developer edition (36.0a2 (2014-12-27)) and the problem still exists with the simulator version 1.3-1.4-2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 don't have this problem.

Hi

I am also facing the same problem reported by Petruta initially. It is on the latest version of FFOS - 38.0.6. I have installed FF simulator versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0 and 3.0 but while running my app on any of these simulators, I am getting the error "Operation timed out:installing and running app"

Kindly help me to resolve this issue urgently.

Regards
Rashmi

Please note : These simulators were working fine in the earlier version of Firefox 37.0.3
