Stealing - this breaks hovering over the default theme and un-applying the lightweight theme in that case, if you're already using a lightweight theme.

I don't actually understand what you mean here. In any case, this doesn't address comment 2.

To be clear, here's my STR:

0. apply patch, rebuild browser/base, browser/components
1. run browser, go into customize mode
2. click themes, then click one of the themes. This applies the theme (rather than just previewing it) and closes the popup.
3. click the themes button again, hover over the "Default" item.

ER:
see the result of using the default theme

AR:
no change from the applied lwt

I expected the previewTheme call for the default theme to be an oversight, but apparently it was expected to do something, which is even worse. (The other unexpected bug I ran into is that browser-devedition.js working around CustomizeMode.jsm's broken behavior is baked into browser-devedition.js.)

This is pretty much expected behavior. LightweightThemeManager.jsm doesn't intend to provide means for "previewing" something that isn't a lightweight theme.

... baked into browser_devedition.js, I meant. I.e. the test counts on the tested code being broken.

Why? You've provided no rationale as to why previewing the default state when using a LWT is a bad thing.

It's a regression from a user POV. That LWTManager doesn't (currently) "intend to provide" this doesn't mean that we shouldn't. In the list of themes, it makes no sense if all themes have hover previews, except the default. If the current way that the preview works is not "correct" from a code POV, then the patch should adjust LWTManager to provide a "correct" way to do this.

Because it's a gross misuse of the API. It only kind of works accidentally.

> ... It only kind of works accidentally.

What ways does it not work?
It's causing this bug, for instance, which browser-devedition.js had to work around.

I don't think we should do this code cleanup without keeping the default-theme preview working though.
It's cleanup as far as browser-devedition.js is concerned, but the CustomizeMode.jsm part is just out of whack and could similarly confuse other observers of the lightweight theme notifications.

Review of attachment 8518259:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I tested out the patch with devedition and it still has the regression where hovering over a default theme after a lightweight theme has been selected doesn't preview any theme.

However, I did come across another bug and I filed it as bug 1095797.

Huh, I could have sworn I was testing out the patch that you requested I review. But I double-checked and I was testing out the patch that Gijs had r-'d. With *this* patch applied, the preview for the default theme now works. Sorry about the earlier comment, and thank for the follow-up needinfo.

patch that attempts to keep working the pseudo-preview for the default theme

I'm hesitant to take this change in beta8 (only one beta left to deal with fallout) on the chance that it will impact add-ons. If this was known to impact add-ons, that would be a stronger case. I'm going to mark beta- and ni Dao in case he wants to come back again today with a case to take this change in Beta.
I don't have a throughout analysis and think we should take this patch opportunistically. However from a quick look it seems that this add-on is affected: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ymobactus/
Judging by this code: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/files/browse/253388/file/chrome/content/ymobactus.class.js#L213
Is there any way that this change will impact/break themes other than wrt add-ons?
I see no way how it could break lightweight themes. Full themes it doesn't affect at all.

Taking this on Aurora at least, so we can get more user feedback (esp with the new bump thanks to DevEd).

Reversing my earlier decision based on comment 21 and comment 23. Let's take this in beta8.
