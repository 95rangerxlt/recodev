The patch for this new code.

These are three new tests that are now passing in Places.  This also fixes a problem in head-queries.js when adding bookmarks through the test data object (it didn't work previously).

FYI: Places Query API tests (most of which fail) are being tracked here:

these are still passing (yay), no reason to not have them running with other tests. i'll take care of pushing.
reassigning to Clint, since he's the author of the tests, there's nothing more to be done though.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
