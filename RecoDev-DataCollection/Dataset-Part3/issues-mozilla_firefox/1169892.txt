The reload of a pending tab is currently handled in the child. The child sends a message to the parent, the parent a message to the child, and we then start restoring. We don't need to involve the parent before we restore the pending tab, it's notified anyway that we started to restore a tab - just like when external code calls browser.loadURI().
