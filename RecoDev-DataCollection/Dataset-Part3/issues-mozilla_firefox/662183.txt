Since YouTube is migrating from Flash to HTML5. Playing back video using HTML5 and doesn't suspend the timer for turning off the display. Which is an irritating experience!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open YouTube
2. Open a video which uses the new HTML5 based playback
3. Play the clip and watch your screen going blank (mid-playback)

Actual Results:  
The only way is to click on a key or move the mouse to suspend the timer from turning off the display.

Expected Results:  
Watch the movie without having to intervene.

Can you specify "screen going blank" and "Timer"?
Or rather attach a Screenshot of the Issue?
Is the Issue reproducible in Safe-Mode, too?

I guess Fareed sketches that the FlashPlayer calls SystemParametersInfo() with SPI_SETSCREENSAVEACTIVE false, but HTML5 video does not. (I'm not sure it works like that, just reading between the lines. And activating the screen saver and turning off the screen are different thing in Windows, BTW.)

A screenshot will probably only show either a normal screen with a movie running in Firefox, or a completely blank screen. Neither of them very useful to understand the problem.
I believe I experience what the author of this ticket did, and I want to provide a description in English.

The issue has started after I switched to the HTML5 mode in my Youtube account. Frequently, when I close a tab with a playing Youtube video, I still hear the sound from the video for many seconds. Just several minutes ago, I refreshed a page with a video because the timer and video wasn't advancing as the sound kept going on, and I ended up with two duplicate tracks playing in parallel. I closed the tab and kept hearing the sound from that video for many seconds.

I am using 32.0a1 (2014-04-29) on 64-bit Windows 8.
No, this is the wrong ticket for my issue.
With todays Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0 the screen saver isn't activated when a Youtube HTML5 video plays. If the video is paused the screen saver goes dark after the given time.

So this was FIXED since 2011. Thanks for your bug report.
