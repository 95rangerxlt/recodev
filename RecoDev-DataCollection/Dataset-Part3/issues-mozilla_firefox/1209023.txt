Localizing the UI in many languages means that it must behave correctly when the various labels shown in are become longer (words/phrases tend to be much longer in German and Spanish than in English for instance).

Bug 1198331 was filed for the inspector.
This is a similar bug for the debugger.

STR:
- open the debugger
- open the debugger variables sidebar
- make the sidebar as small as possible
- using the browser toolbox, inspect the "Variables" tab and make its label longer

==> The longer label overflows its container

The solution that bug 1198331 is taking (for now at least, we may revisit later) is to simply use <tab crop="end"> to add an ellipsis.
I believe this is good enough for now and consistent with other tabs in devtools.

Ok, this looks good to me, but you missed some tabs:

tab#workers-tab
tab#sources-tab
tab#callstack-tab

These should also have their labels cropped when too long.
