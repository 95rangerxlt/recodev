On the UX branch I see several of these messages dumped into the console.  

A coding exception was thrown in a Promise resolution callback.
Full message: TypeError: browser.messageManager is undefined
See https://developer.mozilla.org/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise
Full stack: ParentPort.prototype._dopost/<@resource://gre/modules/FrameWorker.jsm:162
Handler.prototype.process@resource://gre/modules/Promise.jsm:572
@resource://gre/modules/Promise.jsm:354

I have only the demo provider enabled.  allowMultipleWorkers=true.  Happens on startup, as well as each time I reload the provider via the context menu.  Everything seems to work otherwise (basic manual testing using the demo provider).

This error is from ports being closed after the worker terminates (in this specific case, it looks like something to do with social.cookies-get, which seems be be called multiple times per second in the demo provider?)

We should be closing all worker ports we have handed out as the worker terminates - then the ports will all be closed, so attempts to use them after the terminate will either silently do nothing (on another .close()) or throw a more reasonable error if a real message is posted.

This patch seems to silence the errors I saw and seems to be the "right thing" to do.
