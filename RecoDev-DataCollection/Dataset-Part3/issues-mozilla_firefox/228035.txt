Steps to reproduce:
1. Click Ctrl-D.
2. Hit Enter

Actual results:
Nothing.

Expected results:
Add a bookmark.

The OK button in the new add bookmark dialog doesn't work until you selected a
folder in the menulist (small dialog) or the tree (large dialog). Clicking in
the menulist, selecting the first (already selected) folder and clicking OK works.

The js console shows this:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIRDFContainer.Init]"  nsresult:
"0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)"  location: "JS frame ::
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/addBookmark2.js :: onOK :: line 66"  data: no]

The error in the js console refers to this line in addBookmarks2.js:
RDFC.Init(BMDS, gSelectedFolder);
That's because gSelectedFolder is undefined until you select a folder in the
menulist or the tree. It has to be defined in Startup().

Adds gSelectedFolder = RDF.GetResource(gMenulist.selectedItem.id); to
Startup().

This works. I hope it's the right thing to do. :)

Thanks Pierre. Marking fixed.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
