I have noticed in the URL linked in this bug (as well as http://mail.aol.com where I first noticed the bug) that not only do tab previews show up on pressing Ctrl-Shift-Tab, but the focus jumps to the location bar on Ctrl-Tab.

You can also reproduce this by focusing the identity button in the location bar
(click location bar, then press Shift+Tab) and then pressing Ctrl+Shift+Tab or
Ctrl+Tab.

Prevent Ctrl+Shift+Tab from triggering Show All Tabs if browser.ctrlTab.previews is false.

Here's a patch that makes the Show All Tabs thing not pop up when pressing
Ctrl+Shift+Tab in these circumstances.

A couple of questions:

1. Is it OK that I fold in the whitespace fixes in this patch (removing
   CRs), or is it preferable to have that separate?

2. How do I write a test for this?  (So far I've only had experience with
   reftests.)

Thanks!
Thanks for the r+.  I take it I don't need to write a test, then. :-)
This needs approval before it can land on mozilla-central.

Not a regression, so not a blocker. Will take the patch though.
