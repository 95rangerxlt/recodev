In bug 1084525, a promises actor was added, but was set as:

      type: { global: true, tab: true }

in server/main.js[1].

global: true is only meant for actors that correspond to the entire application, like "preferences".  Actors that are meant to used in a page context, including browser toolbox, etc. only need tab: true.

We should remove global: true, unless there is something I'm missing here.
