For bug 658738, I'm investigating if we can treat it as a failure if tests leak global variables, i.e. add new properties on the window object. One of the few remaining unexpected failures is this:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/tabview/test/browser_tabview_bug580412.js | leaked window property: iQEventData

This is from one of these event listeners:

Looks good, we totally should clean up after ourselves here.

Nit: I think it's better to use forEach's second parameter instead of .bind() here.
