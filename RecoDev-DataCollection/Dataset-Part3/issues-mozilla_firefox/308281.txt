For Firefox 1.0.7 and Mozilla 1.7.12, we need changes to the installer script to
remove the files that were installed by the XPI used to temporarily disable IDN
(see bug 307259).  These should probably go on the trunk and 1.8 branch as well,
since some users of other releases may have installed the XPI, and some people
may upgrade from e.g., a XPI-ed 1.0.6 directly to Firefox 1.5 beta2.

self approving for 1.0.7 and 1.8b5

and the corresponding suite change

Note: I don't have a suite installer build so I haven't actually verified that
this patch works but it's pretty straightforward :)

and the corresponding suite change

In theory you may want to change the OS/2 one as well, although it doesn't
currently delete any pref files, which seems a little suspicious to me, so
either way.
both patches checked into the trunk and 1.8

fx patch checked into aviary 1.0.7

suite patch checked into mozilla 1.7 branch
Verifying on nightly 9-13 - for windows:
    1) Install FF 1.0.6
    2) Install XPI - confirm (No IDN) in about and enableIDN=false
    3) Install FF 1.0.7 Nightly 9-13
    4) Confirm About contains FF 1.0.7 only [i.e. No IDN is gone)
    5) Confirm that enable IDN is true
Can we triple-check mac/linux?
 
Verified on Mac using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;
rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 - I get the same results as in Comment 6. 

We should re-check this on Windows and Linux with the latest candidate build.
Verified on Windows - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12)
Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 using the candidate build stamped 2005-09-15-18. We
should verify on Linux and then we have the trifecta.
