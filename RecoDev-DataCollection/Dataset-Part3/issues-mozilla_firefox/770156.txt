We have a built-in type called 'nodelist' for use with commands that accept a querySelector. Changing to this means making a bunch of changes. When you finish updating the command can you ask me for review?

Please add "use strict"; above this line.

Also, the file browser/devtools/client/commandline/test/browser_cmd_qsa.html is missing... you probably forgot to hg add it. No problem though, you can just use:
const TEST_URI = "data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<body></body>";

There appears to be a bug when using the querySelector "a" in tests. For now we can use body instead:
{
       setup: 'qsa body',
       check: {
         input:  'qsa body',
         hints:  '',
         markup: 'VVVVVVVV',
         status: 'VALID'
       }

Updated command

Just applied the changes, thank you a lot for your feedback!

There's something I don't understand though, regarding this: 'runAt: "server",'. If you don't mind explaining, why is the command run at server according to this? And what's the difference?

Sure, these days Firefox is divided into two processes:
1. The process that controls the content of a web page such as DOM nodes. This is called the content or server process.
2. The process that controls the browser, so forward and back buttons, the developer toolbox etc. This is called the chrome or client process.

These processes can only talk to one another in a limited way so the client process cannot directly access a DOM node from the server process.

If you write a GCLI command and it doesn't need to touch content then you should use 'runAt: "client"' but if you need to access something in the content process you should use 'runAt: "server"'

My fault... I had tested with all the changes I suggested but I meant to type this in my feedback:
type: "nodelist",

And not:
type: nodelist,

@Pablo: Can you fix this? It is in devtools/shared/gcli/commands/qsa.js

I will send the patch to the try server to make sure it works on all platforms.

Okay, I will get to fixing that typo now. I can send it to the try server myself as well, to see if it works before requesting review.

qsa.patch

I submitted the previous one with an old version of the repository. New link: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=42f14d8a36b6


It shows some failed/timed out tests but I think they are unrelated to my fix.
That is a lot of failures and your patch seems fine.

I have been looking into it and am not sure what is causing it... really, I don't have much time to look into the test issues but I have pushed to try once with and once without your patch:

Without patch:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=8e160e94586c

With patch:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=b5986a568f59

Let's see if it really is your patch that is triggering the failures.
fx-team was mostly orange for all devtools tests... until today.

Let's push the patch again:

Try looks good, code looks good so more than happy to mark as checkin-needed.
