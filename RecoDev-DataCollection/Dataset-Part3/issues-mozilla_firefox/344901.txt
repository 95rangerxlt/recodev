Use at-poke to poke firefox's accessible tree.
at-poke got no child for document frame.

fix the regression of fix of bug 312093
sorry for my careless review

p.s.
Aaron, lots of html pages have a structure like
<html><body><center> .... </center></body></html>
or
<html><body><div align="center"> .... </div></body></html>

Fix of bug 342035 will create an accessible object for the span or div.
Do you think it is redundant?

Let's talk about this on IRC or email, but I think it's better to have a simple, predictable rule than a complex rule which tries to remove the redundancies.
