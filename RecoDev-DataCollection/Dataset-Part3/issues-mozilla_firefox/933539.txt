The styles that are being read for the titlebar calculations in browser.js have the potential to be defined as real numbers, so we should use parseFloat instead of parseInt to read back the computed styles.

To fix this bug, you'll need to clone the UX branch which is located at https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux. The file in question is located at browser/base/content/browser.js and you'll want to look at the lines around http://mxr.mozilla.org/projects-central/source/ux/browser/base/content/browser.js#4307

Sorry, but this is not enough. You'll need to adjust all the lines in this function that use parseInt to read style values to use parseFloat.

r=me without the bits in the gFormSubmitObserver, which shouldn't be changed. I did say "in this function"... Anyway, I'll land this with the nits fixed.

These two lines are in a different function, so we should probably leave them alone.
Thanks :)
