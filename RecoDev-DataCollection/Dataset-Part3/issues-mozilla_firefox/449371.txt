Sorry my mistake, It should be Thunderbird crashed when exiting.

The root cause is in following snippet:
nsresult
nsScreenManagerGtk :: Init()
{
   ...
    // get the number of screens via xinerama
    if (_XnrmIsActive && _XnrmQueryScreens &&
        _XnrmIsActive(GDK_DISPLAY())) {
      screenInfo = _XnrmQueryScreens(GDK_DISPLAY(), &numScreens);
    }
   ...
}

On OpenSolaris, when XineramaIsActive() is called, it will register the address of close_display() in X, so it will be called when XCloseDisplay() is called

But before XCloseDisplay() is called, the following deconstructor is called

nsScreenManagerGtk :: ~nsScreenManagerGtk()
{
  ...
  if (mXineramalib && mXineramalib != SCREEN_MANAGER_LIBRARY_LOAD_FAILED) {
    PR_UnloadLibrary(mXineramalib);
  }
  ...
}
So, libXinerama.so is unloaded and the function address registered 
in X (i.e. close_display()) is invalid when XCloseDisplay() is called

This causes thunderbird crashes.

This is fine, but please put a comment above the #if explaining what you explained in the previous comment, so that people reading this code in the future know why the library isn't unloaded on solaris.
