As it is going to be used also for the support page (cf bug 1145171), I would like to rename the variable for something more general.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: bug 1145184 - getting the beta information more available
[User impact if declined]: a few weeks more without the beta information available in about:support. This patch is just a basic renaming necessary for the uplift of bug 1145171
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: in m-c + https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c6a6d6bbbaf1 in inbound. 
[Risks and why]: Low risk as we are just renaming some variables. Worst case scenario is that the version information will be empty in the window.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None

Approved. It would be nice to see "real" beta versions in about:support.
