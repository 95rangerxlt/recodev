channel-prefs.js ends up in:

dist/bin/browser/defaults/pref/channel-prefs.js

which isn't found by update tests.

Moving it to 'preferences' solves the problem. But based on the comments in bug 756325 maybe that's not the right fix.

cc'ing a few people.

The code in the app makefile was updated to:

ifndef LIBXUL_SDK
# channel-prefs.js is handled separate from other prefs due to bug 756325
libs:: $(srcdir)/profile/channel-prefs.js
	$(NSINSTALL) -D $(FINAL_TARGET)/defaults/pref
	$(PYTHON) $(topsrcdir)/config/Preprocessor.py $(PREF_PPFLAGS) $(ACDEFINES) $^ > $(FINAL_TARGET)/defaults/pref/channel-prefs.js
endif


FINAL_TARGET points to the browser sub dir.
Moving this file back down to dist/bin also solves the problem. It also lets both browser share the same channel-pref file, so maybe that's the right fix?
This is filed as Win7 but isn't this a Win8 bug?

The channel-prefs.js needs to end up in the defaults/pref directory that is read by the app per bug 756325.

Nick, I'm still tempted to get rid of channel-prefs.js entirely and go with allowing QA to provide an override other than the channel-prefs.js file. If you ever need to change the channel that would still be possible when updating.

I think that is the better way to go for now. If nothing else, they are the same install and there shouldn't be the possibility of having two different channels based due to two channel-prefs.js files.

This is fall out from the metro-build bug, so once that land on mc this will show up there.

Ok, I'll land that change on elm to be sure it addresses the update test failures. Will post a patch here as well for Glandium.

This is needed on m-c, as bug 787180 landed there a while ago. This is effectively a noop until FINAL_TARGET != DIST/bin.
