hi ted,

any idea when update notifier might be read for firefox 3?  we are trying to get as many extensions compatible for the beta releases as possible to increase both testing of the extensions and the beta releases.
last statement of author from 20 Feb 2008:
"I'll definitely be updating the extension for use with FF3 (and others) including update notifications for the browser itself. I'm sorry for the lack of updates but I've been quite consumed with working on the Gmail Manager extension which I'm thankfully close to releasing (for use with FF3). As soon as I get a release out for Gmail Manager I'll begin my development shift towards Update Notifier. Thanks again."

Marking as WFM as the addon got updated.
The extension has been updated (for some time).
