I'll take this.  It looks like what's needed is to add a section into
Privacy->Saved Passwords and perhaps edit the glossary a little (which, if I
remember correctly, includes an entry on the master password).

Yes, that's right.
Marking as blocking 1.0 PR. This needs to be fixed in the Help docs before the
locale freeze.

Describe new UI, tweak glossary, add entry to index

Please note: the master password protects personal certificates as well as
stored passwords (hence the "other|private data" references in changes).

I also added in a few changes to firebird-index1.rdf so that it uses
&brandShortName; for "Firefox".  I've opened the edited RDF file in Firefox and
generated no errors, so those syntactical changes do work correctly.

Looks good! r=rlk@trfenv.com
Checked in.

"&brandShortName; protects saved passwords" should be "&brandShortName; can
protect saved passwords"
"private data" should be "privacy data"
"this button" sounds weird. Should be "the <em>Set/Change Master
Password...</em> button"

and neither "Master Password" nor "Password" show up in Help Search

reopen?

Indeed.

> "private data" should be "privacy data"
Why not mention certificates?

tweak this a bit

I don't like the dialog to provide more information than the Help doc.
So let's add that once-per-session thing.
Also don't mention master password in Security Devices.

Looks good by me.  Nice catch on mentioning how to set the master password, by
the way.

Will check this in in a second...
Thanks for checking in. Marking fixed again.
