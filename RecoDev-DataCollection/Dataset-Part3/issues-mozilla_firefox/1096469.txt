Honza, Florent, does this fix https://github.com/firebug/firebug.next/issues/177?

As I said in https://github.com/firebug/firebug.next/issues/177#issuecomment-62476120, it adds some edge cases if we always disable devedition theme when firebug is applied.  This change makes it use the light one so it isn't broken anymore, and users can always disable the theme as normal.

Why would devedition.css be used when the devtoolstheme attribute is neither "dark" nor "light"? That seems like a bug.

Yes, if the "Use Firefox Developer Edition" button is unchecked
Australis is used as the browser theme. I am thinking about unchecking
the button automatically when the user picks Firebug theme as
the default one in the toolbox.

As I wrote here:

Should it then re-check the button if a user reselects dark/light theme?  I think we'd have to have an extra pref then to keep track of whether it was set *before* the Firebug theme is applied.  And if they come in and manually enable/disable the devedition theme while Firebug is applied, then you wouldn't want to reenable after switching back.  It sounds kind of messy.

I'm not a fan of the UX of that button either - I mentioned here that I'd like to convert the devedition theme to a special lw theme: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094821#c1.  This would allow it to be more integrated into the normal theme switching.  That wouldn't really solve this particular problem though, where we are needing to track/restore whether the DE theme was applied before/after an extension devtools theme is applied.

There is discussion here: https://github.com/firebug/firebug.next/issues/177.  Right now when Firebug 3 is applied (which adds a new theme to native devtools), there is a broken version of the devedition theme applied: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/371705/4978945/9df71a86-68f3-11e4-9e67-20d8ccd60705.png.

So we either need:
* just use the light variables as a default for non-dark themes
* unapply devedition theme when a non-dark/light devtools theme is applied.

Even if we did the second, we would still probably want a patch like this so that things aren't completely broken if someone came in and re-applied it after adding firebug.  Unless if we prevented people from switching to devedition theme when the firebug theme is applied.

See Comment 5 for the reasoning on why we should change from :root[devtoolstheme="light"] to :root:not([devtoolstheme="dark"])

Gijs had a better idea about how to accomplish this - just don't ever set custom theme attributes on the root element.  Added a test for this also.  Pushed to try: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=0e5cfd9afbfe

When the patch is supposed to be released in Developer Edition?
