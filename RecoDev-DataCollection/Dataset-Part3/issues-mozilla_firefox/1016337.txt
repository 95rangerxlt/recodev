For the last couple days, I've noticed that clicking links in external apps (like Mail) brings focus to the browser but doesn't actually open the page you clicked on. Instead, it takes 2-3 tries to get it to work. Would be nice to take a look at that :)

I'm not sure if this is related, but Cmd-W doesn't always close the tab I'm on either, it closes the window of whatever application I was just using in the background. 

So for example, I switch between Nightly and Colloquy a lot. These days, hitting Cmd-W in Nightly often closes the last IRC room I was in in Colloquy :(
Reliable STR (for any of the problems you see) will be *much* appreciated.
I've got a possible fix for this at bug 1013852.

I've started a tryserver build, which should eventually be available at bug 1013852 comment #30.

Please try it out.
This should be fixed by my patch for bug 1013852, which just appeared in a m-c nightly -- today's.  If not, please reopen this bug.
