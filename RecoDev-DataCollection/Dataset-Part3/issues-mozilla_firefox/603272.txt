just as it says, using the taskbar button on Win7 to launch Minefield in private browsing mode doesn't do anything, Minefield just doesn't start.

Reproducible: Always

Able to reproduce. Minefield doesn't start when clicking the Taskbar and Start Menu button to "Enter Private Browsing".

I can just guess bug 568816, cc-ing ehsan
Yeah, dupe of bug 601391.
Can you please include the exact steps to reproduce this bug?

1) close your nightly down completely
2) select enter private browsing mode from the jump list

nothing happens.

If you have a browser open already it works.

Does the same thing happen if you run ./firefox -private-toggle from the command line?

C:\Program Files (x86)\Minefield>firefox.exe -private-toggle

doesn't seem to launch either. :(
yeah it's just that. Was already clear in my first post here...takes one second to reproduce.

This is totally my oversight in bug 568816.  The fix is really simple.  We basically didn't support nsISessionStore.init(null) calls correctly, so the initService stuff that I added in that bug didn't really work.

Much better this way around :) I'd say "write a test" but that's not really in the realm of possible right now. r=me
Gavin, would you mind approving this, please?

Need to also adjust the comment above init() per IRC discussion.

It is working, but if you use this, the entry in the jumplist is still labeled "Enter private browsing" then instead of "Quit private browsing". Maybe someone (who also knows how to fix it) can confirm that and file a new bug?
I think there is a bug for that.

I really could not find any, filed bug 620580.
