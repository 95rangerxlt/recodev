The condition is now:

if (this.isPaintingPaused() || !UI.isIdle)

and should be:

if (this.isPaintingPaused() || !UI.isIdle())

We should add a test to verify that no tabItem updates are done when resizing or moving items.

+      EventUtils.synthesizeMouse(container, 5, 5, {type: "mousedown"}, cw);
+      EventUtils.synthesizeMouse(container, 40, 20, {type: "mousemove"}, cw);
+      EventUtils.synthesizeMouse(container, 20, 20, {type: "mouseup"}, cw);

The above repeats twice, might be good to write a helper function.

The test added by this patch went orange: <http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Cedar/1302807869.1302809327.10302.gz> so I backed it out: <http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/cedar/rev/53339e6932c3>
