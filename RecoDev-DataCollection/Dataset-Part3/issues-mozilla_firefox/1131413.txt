We have a couple of modules used to manage surfacing sync and FxA state in the UI. We need to ensure these modules are also capable of managing similar states from the reading-list engine.

For example, these modules handle "authentication errors" to show an infobar and allow you to sign back in.  We only want one such infobar regardless of the service that raises the error.  Similarly, these modules handle clicking of the "Sync" button and managing its animation - this facility needs to also handle reading list (eg, animate even when only the reading list is syncing, and ensuring both services sync when it is clicked).

This just adds tests for the existing functionality.

This is the "real" patch - it adds reading-list support and updates the test in part 1.  It also adds a gSyncUI.log object, and touches browser.js to add the lazy import there.

So this shows the biggest (most recent) sync time of either Sync or Reading List.

getCharPref?  Isn't this an int pref in terms of seconds?

Yep, and I added a comment to reflect that.  I hope I didn't miss some other point you were making :)

The scheduler patch actually writes this as a formatted date:

> prefs.set("lastSync", new Date().toString());

which is also exactly what Sync does.  I'm happy to change this if you feel strongly, but consistency with Sync and the fact the pref value is human readable make me think this is fine.

Nope, just picture me stroking my beard as I was typing that. :-)  Just wanted to make sure I understood.

I misunderstood.

Do you know why this gBrowser check was in onActivityStart in the first place?

Is it possible gBrowser is there on onActivityStart but gone by the time onActivityStop is called?  _numActiveSyncTasks would get screwed up.

There should probably be an assertion that _numActiveSyncTasks >= 0.  This code can't really do anything about it if it fails, but at least we can know it's happening and try to fix it.

Nit: You don't really need two switches here.  When I first saw this I wondered if the first switch possibly changed the value of topic, and that's why you used two switches.  But I don't want to crimp your style, so only a nit.
Had to disable the test on e10s :( - bug 1137087
