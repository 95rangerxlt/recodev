I have noticed that due to Panorama some of my tabs were missing after a restart (could be after an update). A further check has been shown that those tabs have been moved to another group. As Tim mentioned to me there was already a fix in March but this time it happens with a nearly up-to-date Aurora build. I have no steps at the moment but want to file this bug for further investigation.

So just FTR, the patch from bug 635975 is actually in beta:

http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-beta/file/e04c40d043b6/browser/base/content/tabview/tabitems.js#l868
Hm, seems like it works now with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:7.0a2) Gecko/20110804 Firefox/7.0a2. Not sure if the mentioned bug is related to my system but meanwhile one of those jetpacks could have been updated.

Shall we close it as fixed by bug 635975?
