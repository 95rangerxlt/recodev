This was fixed in 200884, but seems to be overridden by autocomplete.

Pierre, thoughts?

Working perfectly here. Does this still not work for you Mike?

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040302
Firefox/0.8.0+ (Clean install and profile)
I've found this is not 100% reproducible for me either, so I spent some more
time trying to figure out exactly what conditions cause it and what conditions
make it work as it should.

Surprisingly, it seems to be depending on how I invoke firefox.exe:


Causes the bug:

"Internet" shortcut on Start menu when Firefox is the default browser
Cygwin bash shell


Works as expected:

DOS shell
PowerPro shortcut whose target is C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
Start -> Programs -> Mozilla Firefox -> Mozilla Firefox


Steps used in all tests:

1. Invoke Firefox
2. Ctrl+K
3. Ctrl+Down

In all cases that trigger the bug, the actual behavior is the autocomplete
selections are displayed and Ctrl+Up/Down cycles through the selections.


I'm using Windows XP.
Another case that triggers the bug: invoking by clicking a link in Thunderbird.
CTRL-UP works here but CTRL-DOWN doesn't.

I am also experiencing this with the latest nightly branch.

This feature is still broken for me: Ctrl-Up/Ctrl-Down scrolls through
autocomplete history in the Search bar.

The most recent searchbar interface introduced a regression -- Ctrl + Up/Down now seems to act like regular Up/Down.

This bug is closed for a long time, so you should not hijack it for this regression. IMO the behavior of Ctrl+Up/Down should not duplicate Up/Down, though work similar like before. See bug 1108488.
