Related to bug 852420, we should just try to avoid using content: "" where we can, especially because we can stick the images in the actual content: rather than as a background image.

Does this actually avoid bug 852420? I wouldn't expect it to. Also, with the image injected as content, I don't think it would behave like you'd expect when using -moz-box, e.g. it wouldn't stretch.

This was actually surprisingly little work (less than border-image!) and this patch by itself seems to work on OS X, and is net code + selector removal! :-)

I've started a try run to look at how this looks on Windows and Linux: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=61cc4e06702a

AFAICT, this looks fine Windows and Linux, too.

It would be good to make sure this will align with what's needed for bug 850918 so we don't just end up reverting this. Would you mind taking that bug and getting review on it before landing this?

This is going to have to change (to -2px) in bug 858089 but I guess we can do this in the meantime.

Nit: Would you mind removing the quotes while you're touch this line so it's consistent with most of the file? I'll handle the other case in bug 826689.

These don't look like they'll interfere. Can we land this one on UX and move on? :-)
