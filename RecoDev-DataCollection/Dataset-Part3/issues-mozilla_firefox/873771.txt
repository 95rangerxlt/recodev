The refactoring from bug 865127 should go even further and read and check the restore_on_demand prefs. This way the main sessionstore module only needs to ask for a tab and gets one if there's more to be restored automatically.

I don't understand why you can simplify the condition that much.
Have you moved all the logics to shift()? If so, what's the rationale?

This should probably be renamed and/or namespaced so that we know at first glance it's a preference.
What about moving this to TabRestoreQueue.Prefs.restoreOnDemand?

Indeed, it's all in shift() now. I figured that it's a lot easier to read the main sessionstore module if it doesn't have to care about the restore_on_demand prefs and whether we have pinned tabs that would be restored right now. If shift() returns a tab we can restore it, if not we're not really interested in finding out why and just accept that.

Yeah... so how about having a small Prefs object/module inside of sessionstore that simply holds live values of all the preferences we need? We can do that in a follow-up soon? This would remove a lot of boilerplate code.

Will do exactly this for now.

Oh, hm. I just realized that this isn't one of the bugs that needs to be put behind a kill switch. Its regression (bug 875266) was quite "bad" anyway so let's fix this before re-landing.
Re-landed with a fix for a tiny, stupid mistake that was the cause of bug 875266.
