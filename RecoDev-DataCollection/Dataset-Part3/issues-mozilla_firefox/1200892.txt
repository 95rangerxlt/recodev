Is this a regression?
I tested Fx36 [ok] and ESR 38 [not ok].
I've been trying to reproduce this on my Win10 machine with mozregression and haven't been able to so far. Maybe a Win7-specific issue?

arni2033, would you be interested in trying to help narrow this down using the mozregression tool? If so, I'd be happy to help you try to do so.

I think it's WinXP-Win8 -specific judging on media selector in chrome://browser/skin/devedition.css
Here's my investigaion and also a solution that works ("I added this text" on screenshot):

I don't have time and traffic to use mozregression now. I'd use it for all regressions I reported if I had time.   (Don't you have a specially organized team for that? I'd join such "team" if I had time. I guess there's lots of people which do have time)
We don't have a formalized regression hunting team at this time, no. Efforts are underway to improve that, though. But we rely very much on our volunteers to help where possible. If you ever want to get your feet wet, send me an email or ping me on IRC and I'd be happy to help :)

devedition theme means it's not useful to uplift to beta.
