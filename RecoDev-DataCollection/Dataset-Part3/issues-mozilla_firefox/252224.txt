i've seen that there were recently made a lot of favicon-fixed to aviary. Now,
most of them seems fixed, however, there is still one that isn't.
As you can see in the screenshots i will attach, the icon for "The Burning Edge"
is a google one. After i click it, it becomes a FireFox one. When i close
firefox and restart it, i is back a google icon.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. start my firefox
2. look at the google icon in front of "The Burning Edge"
3. click "The Burning Edge"
4. look how it changes to a FireFox icon
Actual Results:  
icon changed but it wasn't saved

Expected Results:  
save it

Duplicate of bug 174265 ?
my build is 20040717, and that's from the build where that bug is fixed, so it
can't be a duplicate since that one should be fixed.
There was a bug in the 20040717 build that caused updated favicons to sometimes
not get stored.  Please try with a more recent one.
hmm, i will have to wait till there comes a linux build then, because the
20040719 hasn't a linux build...
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-0.9/ has linux
nightlies from today.
ok, sorry, i tried 200407220 and there it is fixed, so this bug can be marked
invalid
hmm, no wait, that burning edge bug issue is fixed, so i guess the icons are
saved correctly now, but can somebody try to bookmark www.dot.tk and see if that
favicon is saved when you click it? i can see the icon in the adressbar, but it
doesn't appear in the bookmark menu. when i click my own site
(www.maycosplace.tk), i get a empty favicon (so not a blank page, just a
transparant empty favicon).

Your site has an invalid favicon; or rather, www.maycosplace.tk/favicon.ico ends
up redirecting back to your home page.  Mozilla tries to prase this as an image
and fails, but that failure is (currently) not being handled in any way... so
you get a blank favicon.  I've got some ideas on how to prevent this from
happening for bookmarks at least.

resolving this bug, bug 252540 for the other issue.
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs, filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
