don't write out id attribute on export, as it confused firefox 2

found this today while testing places-trunk-bookmarks to firefox 2.

if you have ID on the personal toolbar folder, will be blank.

note, this goes for other folders, too under the bookmarks menu.

chatting with mano, we think the right fix is to use ITEM_ID instead.  testing that now.

note, in our places import / export code, we already claim to ignore ID (yet we weren't, but we should have.)

fixed by bug #371827

we could definitely add this to the test suite.

also, I need to log a bug on firefox 2 about better handling of non-ID attributes.  (we should treat them like there is no ID attribute at all.)

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
