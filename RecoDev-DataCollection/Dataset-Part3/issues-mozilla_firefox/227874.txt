I don't doubt that this crash doesn't occur on Linux or Windows, as I assume
that the software is usually tested frequently on those two platforms. However,
I'm stuck here on Solaris and I really need a decent browser. Firebird is
crashing way too frequently on Sparc/Solaris. I assume that
for some reason the Solaris build is picking up some bugs that for whatever 
reason haven't occurred often on other platforms, so fixing these Solaris
crashes will probably be beneficial for the software as a whole.
Did Firebird .7 or Firefox .9 or .9.1 behave any differently?  .9 on XP works
fine.  Does mozilla 1.6 or 1.7 crash on this site on Solaris?

0.9.1 does not crash on OS X

Sigh.... give this one a shot:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9.2/contrib/

If there is no further complaint in the next couple of days I'll close this.
Just downloaded and installed Firefox 0.9.1 for Solaris/Sparc. Went to OSNews
and there isn't any crash. Seems to be fixed.
