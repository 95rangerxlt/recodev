While I was investigating the failure of the test added in bug 806690, I realized that many of these tests open and close windows, and set load listeners for test windows opened.  The default value for browser.startup.page (1) means that we try to load about:home, which means that if the test does things such as register content load handlers, it may get the one issued for about:home if the test machine is loaded enough.  Fortunately, the fix is very simple.  Patch forthcoming.
