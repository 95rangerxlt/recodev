Expression closures (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) are a nonstandard language extension we'd like to remove from SpiderMonkey.

In WindowsPreviewPerTab.jsm, I believe this only affects the resetCanvasPreview method:

The general pattern is that 'function (x) y' should be replaced with 'function (x) { return y; }'. However, resetCanvasPreview doesn't actually want to return something, so the 'return' statement should be omitted.
