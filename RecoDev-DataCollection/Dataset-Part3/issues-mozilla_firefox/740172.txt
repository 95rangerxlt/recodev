I am unable to reproduce on OSX and Windows 7.  What other add-ons do you have installed?

I have no other add-ons installed other than Nokia's "Firefox Synchronization Extension 1.7.110.333" which is installed but disabled and I can't figure out how to remove it. How do I remove "Nokia Firefox Synchronization Extension"?. There's no "Remove" link in Tools |Add-ons for this extension!
Unable to reproduce on Mac or Windows 7. Must have been fixed somehow - closing it for now, please reopen if it resurfaces.
