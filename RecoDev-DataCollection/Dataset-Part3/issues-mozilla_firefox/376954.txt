Attempting to access the childCount property of an nsINavHistoryContainerResultNode instance throws NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE if the object's containerOpen property is false.

This may be deliberate, in which case the docs on childCount should be updated to reflect this.  Otherwise, some typical error value like -1 might be appropriate?

To recreate:

  var historyService = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/nav-history-service;1"]
    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsINavHistoryService);
    
  var options = historyService.getNewQueryOptions();
  var query = historyService.getNewQuery();
  query.domain = "foo";

  var result = historyService.executeQuery(query, options);
  //result.root.containerOpen = true;
  alert(result.root.childCount);

Add @throws line for childCount

As discussed - the behaviour is correct as is, it's the documentation that is lacking.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
