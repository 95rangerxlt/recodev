I found more about the European Economic Area (EEA) builds here:

The Windows 8 Metro Style Enabled Desktop Browser whitepaper says that for these builds ( http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/n-editions ) we should be calling:

  SHChangeNotify(SHCNE_ASSOCCHANGED, SHCNF_DWORD | SHCNF_FLUSH, nullptr, nullptr);

Exactly like that at the end of installations.

We were already calling it without these parameters: SHCNF_DWORD | SHCNF_FLUSH

So this bug is just to add those.

Hopefully this will fix the annoying icon refresh on update.
It won't :) I only added the extra params to the installer. I don't think they make a difference in terms of refresh though.
To get rid of that flash on updates we'd have to add an ApplicationID::Get, and then only conditionally call ApplicationID::Set and the shell taskbar updated notify call.
