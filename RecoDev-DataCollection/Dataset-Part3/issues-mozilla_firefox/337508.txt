If at all possible we need to get this done for a2 in order to avoid confusion (again) when we release this milestone that we've release Firefox 2.
Sounds like we should just rename the files when doing staging, instead of looking for a systemic fix. Is that what you intended?
Yes, renames would work.  The important thing right now is to avoid confusion as the URLs and filenames propagate across the Web when we release these development milestones.

That said, the ideal would be to have this all tied up into how we set official vs. unofficial and production vs. development builds so that when a build is ``minefield'' or ``bonecho'' or ``firefox'' all of the filenames from installers to binaries automagically align.

Over to rhelmer, since he did the work for a2, but I'll resolve it, since bone-cho alpha 2 has already shipped.
