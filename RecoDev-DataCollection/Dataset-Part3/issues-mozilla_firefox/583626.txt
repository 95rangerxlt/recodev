In previous versions, new windows were drawn down and to the right, unless the bottom or right side of the screen had been reached, in which case they would be drawn elsewhere, but still on screen. With 4.0b2, new windows always get drawn down and to the right, until the upper left corner of the youngest window is almost to the lower or right edges of the screen. This causes most new windows to be drawn partially off screen if the window size is close to the screen size.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 4.0b2.
2. Manually size the window so the lower right corner is near the lower right corner of the screen.
3. Hit Ctl-N to open a new window.
4. Repeat 2 & 3 a few times.
Actual Results:  
New windows will continue to be drawn farther and farther off screen.

Expected Results:  
New windows should be positioned entirely on screen.

This continues to be an issue in 4.0b3.
I confirm the reported behavior.

The behavior occurs on Firef0x 4.0b2 and 4.0b3.

It does not occur on Firefox 4.0b1 or 3.6.8 or prior versions.

To me as well, this appears to have been fixed in 4.0b.
