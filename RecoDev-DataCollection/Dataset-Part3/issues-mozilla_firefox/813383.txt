Patch

There are a couple loops within socialchat.xml that use firstChild/nextSibling/lastChild to iterate through the chats, but it actually only cares about the <chatbox> elements.

I attached a patch to clean this up. I didn't touch the
> this.selectedChat = aChatbox.previousSibling ? aChatbox.previousSibling : aChatbox.nextSibling
line since bug 808235 already fixes this instance.
