patch v1

Do you know what's the cause of the problem? Is that because tabViewCommand.doCommand() is not reliable?
The doCommand() does fail sometimes. Maybe when the window lost its focus? AFAIK there was some other test that was failing intermittently because of this, right? I just figured that this test doesn't really need to trigger the command directly :)
We can use waitForFocus to make sure that the test window is focused, if that's necessary.

Yeah I know, from your docs about intermittently failing tests :) But IMHO we don't really need to test here if the command is working because that test is about LTR/RTL.
