Pardon my ignorance. What is a firefox-on-xulrunner setup?

initial patch

This patch fixes the resource links to NetworkHelper.jsm and PropertyPanel.jsm which are both installed in app/modules besides HUDService.jsm

_But_ I still get errors when trying to open webconsole.
I couldn't figure out why as the errors are still the same:

But I can verify that the resource links are pointing to available modules.

running Firefox as xul app on top of xulrunner. Both are installed in different places and therefore //app and //gre are not pointing to the same place.

There are two PropertyPanel.jsm references in inspector.js that it wouldn't hurt to update as well.
