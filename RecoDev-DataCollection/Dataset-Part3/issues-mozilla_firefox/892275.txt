Adds ability to press F2 to edit selected node.  When editing, pressing F2 again acts as accel+enter (it will save changes if anything has changed, or close the editor if not).  Additionally, we now refocus the doc after editing has finished, so you can continue to use keyboard shortcuts on the selected node.  

I've also split up the outerHTML tests, since it was already causing an intermittent timeout and I was adding more to it.
