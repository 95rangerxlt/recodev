Record the pending request stack as a debugging aid during tests.
For the moment, I plan to move |testing| off gDevTools and onto DevToolsUtils, so that it's available in toolkit.

We can then undo workarounds like bug 1160837 comment 34.

Could you spawn some more instances of mochitest-devtools, just to be sure there is no hidden intermittent?

(Diff revision 3)
> -  gDevTools.testing = isTesting;

Do you know why this test used to toggle testing and no longer needs to? (was that just copy paste?)
I'm lost now, it looks like you did the same patch in bug 1151414, but without using testing flag?!
Nick, maybe you can provide some guidance here.  This bug (which I wrote patches for, but then I forgot about while working on RDP async stacks which you reviewed recently - bug 1151414) wanted to record just "regular" stacks when a protocol.js request is sent.

At the time that Alex and I discussed this particular bug, it seemed logical to only do the stack recording during testing, in case there was speed or memory cost worth avoiding for every RDP request.

So, my question is: is stack recording in general an expensive operation in time and/or space to be avoided for the case of every RDP request?  What about in the async stack case?  I am aware of bug 1152893 (async performance regressions), but I was not sure if I should be worried about that here.

I wouldn't worry much about bug 1152893; that is when you are microbenchmarking an operation that captures an async stack in a loop some thousand of times vs one an operation that does not. We never do anything like that with RDP protocol requests, but unfortunately stuff on the web does do that with promises. Either way, I wouldn't worry about it here. And we are improving the situation in bug 1028418 and bug 1177508.

TLDR: I wouldn't worry about it.
Oh, and regarding space: can't get around the fact that you are capturing stacks and need to store them somewhere, when before you were not, however the js::SavedStacks machinery was designed to be compact: http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/61/
Thanks Nick.  So, it seems like we can leave async stacks always on for RDP requests.

The original focus of this bug is no longer relevant, but I'll proceed with the testing flag move in a new bug.
Will continue the testing flag work in bug 1178851.
Actually, I was looking at a pending request failure, and bug 1151414 only shows stack of request failure, not *pending* rejection.

I'm able to debug pending now, thanks!
