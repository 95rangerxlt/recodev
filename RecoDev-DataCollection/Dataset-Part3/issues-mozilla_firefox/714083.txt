SUMO just finished moving over to support.mozilla.org. Links to support.mozilla.com will redirect over, but the links in Firefox (Help->Firefox Help, for example) should be updated to avoid the 301 redirect.

This is just updating the app.support.baseURL preference to s/.com/.org/.

zpao, can you help us get this to the right place?

Patch v0.1

Are there any other changes that we should make to this pref while we're here? It seems that regardless of version & platform I'm just getting redirected to su.m.o/LOCALE/home?as=u. It looks like mobile uses sumo/mobile as it's base url.

Relatedly, make sure you file a bug for mobile as well if you haven't already.
The locale, platform, and version bits can be used to direct specific Firefoxes to specific articles for any particular topic. I think it's used in a couple of places, but not with the generic F1/Firefox>Help links.

I'll go file a mobile bug.
