While attempting to remove the deprecated-sync-thenables from protocol.js (bug 1096490), I ran into a unhandled promise rejection within protocol.js. The problem seems to be that we're trying to send a packet after the connection has closed. Protocol.js needs to report these errors rather than silently ignore them.

This should be:

    e => DevToolsUtils.reportException("Front.prototype.send", e)

(Sorry for the drive-by)
(Instead of `Cu.reportError`)
