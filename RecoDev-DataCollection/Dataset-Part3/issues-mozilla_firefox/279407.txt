Whenever I attempt to print a page with Greek (ISO-8859-7) text on it, almost
all greek text is emitted from the printout, making it worthless. I can print
Greek normally from all other applications. I'm using Linux, but my brother has
exactly the same problem using Windows XP: all the printouts that contain greek
characters are a mess. The same happens when I print to postscript file. Don't
know if I have to take any special localization action to enable it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Print a page with greek text in it.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Text is horribly mangled, most (if not all) letters are missing.

is this working for you on a newer (recent) release?
(it's possibly fixed by bug 121879)
Just checked today. Does not work on Linux.

Visit any webpages (www.in.gr www.hellug.gr), with iso-8859-7 or utf-8 text, try
to print, and Ã¬ is the only letter that will print - all other characters are
not printed at all.

No localization actions will help. The only way to print Greek from Firefox is
to get a release with freetype2-enabled. People from HelLUG
(http://www.hellug.gr) are already distributing their own builds with freetype2
enabled.

Please note: so far, all my attemps to print Greek from Windows are successful,
only Linux fails. You said that your brother won't print from XP either: this
must be due to bad configuration.
speculating ... bug 248790?
Well, this turned out to be a configuration issue. Printing from the nightly
works perfectly! 

I haven't double-checked https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=248790
because the Linux machine is not easily accessible. I will experiment with a
"fresh" installation ASAP and write about any special steps that need to be
taken before being able to print.
fixed in 1.5
