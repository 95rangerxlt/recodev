When you right click the menu panel to make the context menu appear the footer icons (customization/help and quit) slightly move up and down. I'm seeing that on Windows 7, I don't know about the other platforms.

Clean profile? I can't reproduce on my machine, but maybe it depends on what's in the panel?

Yeap clean profile. I've tested the issue quickly and it doesn't seem related to specific widgets in the panel but on the number of widgets in a row. I can only reproduce with the last row complete (3 widgets).

Hrm. I still can't reproduce. Sorry! :-(

I presume this is latest nightly and win7 aero glass? Note that on latest nightlies, a clean profile should have 10 items, so 1 item (devtools) on the last row (I can't reproduce with either that config or when I remove the devtools). Do you see it when the panel is open as a panel as well as in customize mode? Is this a recent regression, and if so, do you know the regression window (e.g. from the nightly before today's?)

Also needinfo'ing Jared, in case he has ideas...

> 10 items

That is, the 2 wide things (cut/copy/paste + zoom controls) + 10 'small' items.

Yes Win 7 Aero glass. I can reproduce as soon as I remove the devtools. AFAIK it happens only since yesterday's build (01.19.2014). The issue isn't present in customization mode. It's not very noticeable. To see it it's better to right click a lot of time.

Note also bug 924314. Not sure if they're related.
Can't reproduce anymore in latest Nightly (01-26-2014)
Then this was probably fixed by bug 924314. :-)
