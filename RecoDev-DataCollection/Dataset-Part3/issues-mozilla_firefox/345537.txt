World Firefox Day, without any big publicity push, is already a pretty huge success. Part of the campaign promises that people who sign up friends will be listed in Firefox 2. They'll actually be listed on a web page, since we want to be able to maintain this campaign over time, but that page should be linked to in some way from the product.

The page links should be generated as:

http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/friends/2.0/en-US/
                                       ^^^^^^^^^
                                       version #, locale string 

We'd originally thought of adding an about:friends page, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do that such that it's Firefox only without using IFDEFs. Another way to do it would be to add an element to the credits.xhtml file that contains the link. Attaching a proof of concept patch next.

adds "Friends of Firefox" to the list of contributors

Need to add support for:
  - localization
  - generating the right link as per comment 0

Also need to fix the fact that now this peeks through the transparent GIF before we start scrolling. And maybe add a "Contributors" header or something.

How will our names be included in Firefox 2?
 * If both you and your friend opt-in to have your names included, weå€¤l add your names to an interactive Firefox friends display that will be accessible from within Firefox 2.

What is the definition of "interactive" here?

Reed: we're working on scoping this out right now. The "Friends" link will call a web page hosted on mozilla.com; we will then display a searchable list of names of people who participated in Firefox Day. As soon as we have a requirements document ready I'll attach to this bug.

My concern here is that the promise to be "directly accessible from within Firefox 2," while vague, seems to promise something more exclusive than just a link. Although I suppose a hardcoded link somewhere in the browser does fulfill the letter of the promise.

And just to make sure I have the answer clear - you guys didn't have a clear idea of what you meant by interactive and you're figuring that out now?  Or you had a specific idea in mind and are now figuring out of it's possible?

Hey Lucy -- we had a specific idea in mind: delivering a "namecloud" that would be navigable and deliver information about the sundry ways an individual had participated in the Mozilla project, whether that involved Spread Firefox, World Firefox Day, Bugzilla, or core development. Trying now to figure out how we can deliver this interactive display using web standards rather than a proprietary format like Flash. More shortly.

WIP: Add link to credits page
mwu, looking good. Needs to be centered a little more, but other than that, we're on the right track.

Lucy, I filed bug 346046 to track the actual implementation of the virtual wall.

A bit better looking, but I think the table is killing the scrolling..

This works as a low bar. There's a couple of things we could do to polish it up a bit:

 - add "Many thanks to our" in small text above the two links
 - put an ampersand between the two links instead of a pipe

so

        Many thanks to our
    _friends_ & _contributors_

But this is even uir+ as it is.

r=me, this is zero risk outside of the about box and should get on branch ASAP
The link in the patch points to http://worldfirefoxday.com, that sounds wrong.

It is a placeholder until we find out where we're suppose to point it to. I didn't localize it because I'm assuming that can be handled on the server side. I'll change it if that's not the case.

a=mconnor on behalf of drivers for checkin to 1.8 branch for 1.8.1
mozilla/browser/base/content/credits.xhtml 	1.17
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/credits.dtd 	1.5
mozilla/browser/base/content/credits.xhtml 	1.10.4.6
mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/credits.dtd 	1.4.4.1
I'm finding that it's impossible to click on either of the two new links until the display starts scrolling.  The only thing more frustrating than that is actually trying to hit them once they do start scrolling.
That's bug 348814, which, AFAICT, didn't make it into B2. Just tried to click my way through to the friends and failed.
