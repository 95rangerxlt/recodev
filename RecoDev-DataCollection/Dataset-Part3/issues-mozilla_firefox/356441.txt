I learned of the bug from Destian on this post http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2535867#2535867
The problem has occurred with and without a fresh profile. 
I checked yesterday's build and it did not work. After that I jumped back to the 6th and it works fine, so...

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061006 Minefield/3.0a1 WORKS
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061011 Minefield/3.0a1 DOES NOT WORK

The regression is somewhere in between those two dates.
The error from the console is:
Error: gBrowser is not defined
Source File: chrome://reporter/content/reporterOverlay.js
Line: 74

That error isn't relevant, it's harmless.

Not related, that has always showed up as soon as you open the customize window.

The thought did cross my mind to search bugzilla for gbrowser.  But left after searching for customiz*. :)
Bug 313359
All right, I narrowed it down:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061010
Minefield/3.0a1 DOES WORK

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061011
Minefield/3.0a1 DOES NOT WORK

...so the regression takes place in the Oct 11th nightly.

Obviously, this is the same thing I discussed with you the other night on IRC.

It looks like 191400.  There's also a drag and drop regression in Thunderbird.

Posting following per gavin's request, for his followup: 

I'd suspect bug 191400 checkin within the above regression range. (it has also apparently caused TBird/mailnews regression bug 356429.

That provides an easy workaround: Hold down the shift key while dragging.

Yep, that works for me!

Fixed by the backout of bug 191400.
