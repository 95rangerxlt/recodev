This will only make it so new profiles (or those that haven't been used with Firefox 3.6 or newer) won't get getpersonas.com added to the whitelist. Existing profiles will continue to have it in the permissions database as allowing installs.

Unfortunately, we don't currently have a way to remote entries from the permissions manager (I'm not sure we've ever removed anything from this before). Filed bug 861115 for that.

So, as a stop-gap, we should also add getpersonas.com to the blacklist (xpinstall.blacklist.add.<version>), just to be safe - since we can't guarantee Mozilla will hold onto that domain indefinitely (seems reasonable to let it expire eventually).

We try to have the version represent the earliest version that had it added - and I assume we'll want to backport this to Beta (see bug 744355 comment 2 for the last time we did that dance).

I don't expect we'll ever let the domain expire (domains are relatively cheap). So while it might make sense to do as you say and add it to the blacklist, I don't think it needs to block this patch.

Could you at least file a followup bug for this, dependant on bug 861115?
