Why does my Gecko date looks like 2010?

Possible dupe of bug #1125734 ?
I don't have access to it.

It always does. Can you get crash report IDs via about:crashes, please? Does it not crash if you turn off e10s?

I will do so tonight as I dual boot into Linux. I use Windows outside of work.
For the record, this does not happen on Ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS.

It crashes with and without.
I can confirm this is happening on Ubuntu 14.04.  It happens every time I visit a site that LastPass attempts to auto-login into.

My apologies for the delay!

Here are the crash IDs:

For the record, I don't have auto login for expensify.
Has it crashed in the last couple of days? That’s the same signature for the crash in bug #1125734 that has been patched.

I had not needed to sign in to expensify.
I will try tonight from my Windows machine (where I had the issue).

I signed in on Ubuntu with e10s enabled and LP filling the fields and it worked.
The only issue I saw is that for 5-8 seconds my browser froze (the colors go away and can't do any interaction) and came back.

Disabling LastPass fixes this other issue. It was very bad as every page would freeze the browser.

Anyone from LastPass in here that could investigate this issue?
I managed to sign in.
Fixed here, too.  The segfaults are gone and auto-login works again on Ubuntu nightly w/ Build ID 20150204150446.
