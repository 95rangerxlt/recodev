I always have session store enabled and gmail loaded so when I closed Firefox via the X button in the top right and reopen Firefox, 99% of the time gmail won't load again and gets stuck on the page with the progress bar trying to load the inbox.  I've seen this for months on both XP and Vista.  This is probably related to AJAX.

1) Have gmail (v2) open and session store enabled
2) Close firefox
3) Restart and 99% of the time gmail doesn't load completly and gets stuck loading on the page that has the progressbar.

This reliably WORKSFORME.
* Does this happen on a clean profile as well?
* Does this happen from your work/home PC as well (ruling out connection issues)?
* Do you get any errors in the Error Console?
This happens to me as well. I saw that first time restarting the tab it loads, but other times, it won't. No errors from Error Console.
(WinXP, Firefox 3.0.1)

Can't use it at work but I have multiple profile at home on different versions of firefox/minefield

Not sure, will check out later


Problem occurs for me as well. Refresh is always needed to complete loading mail.
Please don't just add "me too" but provide further information such as:
* What Firefox version you're using (see Help -> About Mozilla Firefox).
* Whether this also happens when disabling all extensions (in Safe Mode).

Bonus points for:
* Whether it also happens when just closing the Gmail tab and then reopening it through History -> Recently Closed Tabs.
* What language Gmail is currently set to.
* Whether you use any of the new Gmail beta features.

So, I looked into it a bit more, and..

- Yes, it happens when reopening through history as well
- Yes, it happens in Safe mode too
- English language is set
- Beta features - I never turned anything on, so.. most possibly, no..

Also I noticed that refreshing the stuck panel doesn't help, you need to type the URL again.

(firefox 3.0.1, winxp)

Exactly the same thing here except with both 3.0.1, 3.0 and trunk nightlies for past couple of months.

Alright, I've somehow managed to occasionally hit this as well. Don't see what could trigger it, though. Next guess: Does it happen on http:// only or when enforcing a secure connection through https:// (see the Gmail preferences) as well? So far, I've only seen it on non-secure connections.
I always use the secure connection https://

don't restore wyciwyg URLs

After some more debugging, I think I've found the issue: Gmail has us explictly cache several script-only documents which are loaded in (i)frames. Trying to restore these breaks Gmail in the way reported by this bug.

As these are wyciwyg URLs, there would be no point in restoring them after a crash, anyway (which BTW currently also causes bug 424689), so we should just ignore them (meaning that we have to refrain from loading anything in the frameset so that the default URLs aren't overwritten).

If you're affected by this issue, please try to manually apply this patch to the file nsSessionStore.js in Firefox's components directory and make sure that this fixes the issue for you.

Session store isn't working after adding those lines.  I keep getting: 
Error: illegal character
Source File: file:///C:/Junk/firefox/components/nsSessionStore.js
Line: 1, Column: 1
Source Code:
ï»¿/* ***** BEGIN LICENSE BLOCK ***** 

I know it is not due to adding those lines of code but I can't figure out why it seems to be saving those characters weirdly even though they look fine in notepad.  Any suggestions?
Probably a character encoding issue
Works with wordpad, weird.  I've closed Firefox about 20 times, reopened it and haven't seen the issue yet.

We're no longer taking "nice to haves" on the branch.

We need this for Firefox 2 as well.

Doesn't help for bug 459906, after all.
