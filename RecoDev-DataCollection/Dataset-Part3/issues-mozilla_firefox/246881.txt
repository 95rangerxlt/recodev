User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614
Build Identifier: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9/firefox-0.9-source.tar.bz2

The firefox-0.9-source.tar.bz2 tarball doesn't contain the mozilla/browser
directory, so it's impossible to actually build Firefox from it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and extract the tarball.
2. Follow the Firefox build instructions: create mozilla/.mozconfig, run configure.


Actual Results:  
The configure script dies because it can't include browser/mozconfig from my
.mozconfig.

Expected Results:  
The software should configure and build correctly.

The obvious workaround (and presumably the reason nobody spotted this) is that
you can pull the source happily from CVS. It's useful to have a working source
tarball for automated software build systems, though.

(It would also be nice if Firefox releases were consistent about what the source
tarball was called -- the convention's changed for each of the last three
releases -- but that's another story altogether...)

And after this bug is fixed, http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/
should be updated to point to the new tarball.
It has been added. I filed bug 246927 about updating the project page.
