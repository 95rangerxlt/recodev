Update default (en-US) eBay Search Plugin

"http://shop.ebay.com/?_nkw={searchTerms}" is a very strange value for a parameter *value*. Is the intention to change the actual URL to that?
yes. that's the value of the attribute supplied to the redirect service, which is essentially an instruction of which URI to load following the cookie-set by the rover service. I can't think of a better way to do it, because of the "?" instead of an ampersand, and it works as expected. Is there a preferred way to put it together?

The "type" attribute is ignored on Image elements, so no need to add that. r=me with it omitted.

> <Url type="text/html" method="GET" template="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-47294-18009-3/4">

This is a really odd setup - it would be optimal to avoid the "rover" redirect and instead just load the results page directly. I guess it's no worse than what we have today, but this seems like something we should take up with eBay to try to improve in the future.
I don't know how much we can improve it. The initial query to rover is required for agreement tracking, and then rover redirects the query to mpre. Because it treats the whole URI as the argument, I left it as it is. It's actually better than what we have today, where there are four separate redirects. I'll re-file with the type attribute removed, and then it'll just need some landing action.
