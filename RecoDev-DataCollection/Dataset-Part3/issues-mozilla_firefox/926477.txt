This looks good. I had to fix the commit message as all of the patch details got pulled in to the summary somehow.

I've pushed this to the fx-team repository. If all goes as planned, it should be merged to mozilla-central in a day or two, and then the following day the changes will appear in the Nightly build of Firefox. Congratulations on your first patch! :)
