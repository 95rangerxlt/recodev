Actually, no need to cancel, and more than just livemarks: it's also dead if you subscribe to one rather than cancelling, and then try to subscribe to another, and it's also dead after subscribing with a local client application.
Hrm, is this just another way to get bug 257438, since we're apparently loading the feed even when we're going to skip the preview?

That seems like a good thing to avoid, for things like authentication and the fact that we'll then fail to pass on the URL to a currently unresponsive feed (data:text/html,<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="http://example.com:440/rss.xml"> will appear to not have done anything, until it eventually shows an error page, even if you were just trying to pass the URL to an external app without preview).
Don't know if this helps, but after the rss icons gets broken, if you go to another tab and back, the rss icon is actually gone!

Ben - any updates on this?

While this isn't the nicest way to fix this bug, I believe this case is less common so given the timeframe it's the most preferable. There may be better long term solutions, but I think the code complexity of such solutions may pose more risk at this time.

You might want to rev the UUID of the interface since we've shipped this interface in FF2b1.  Also, channel.notificationCallbacks is not required to provide a nsIWebNavigation.  Though in the case of page navigations, I can't imagine why it would not.  You may want to comment about this or maybe even protect against an exception.

A nsIChannel is a nsIRequest, so the QI to nsIRequest should (I think) be unnecessary.

approving both patches for branch landing per beltzner and myself, needed ASAP as it is blocking the fix for another blocker that's blocking the new prefwindow from landing
