This changeset shows 3 tests tat were disabled by the compartments landing. We should track here what needs to happen to re-enable them. bug 604431 details the symptoms of one of these issues, the tab-completion.

Yup, these need to go back on before we ship.

sounds like the fix in bug 604431 will fix one of these tests.

I don't think this needs to land on the branch, as robcee tells me that the tests weren't disabled there. Though they might be when we merge GC compartments over? So confused!
yeah, this is confusing.

We had a number of tests broken up post-b7 branch detailed in bug 581069. These weren't ported back.

The patch to reapply the disabled tests here doesn't apply cleanly to b7 as a result.

BUT! These individual tests were never disabled on b7, so they will still run (and indeed do run, just verified) just fine there.

We could back-port the split tests, though some of them may rely on non-branchy code. In which case, they'd have to be disabled. If you and the other release drivers think this is warranted, we can do it, but I wanted to make sure we knew where we stood with this bug.
