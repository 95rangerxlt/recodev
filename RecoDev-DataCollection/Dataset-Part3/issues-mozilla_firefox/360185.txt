I installed IE7 from microsoft. then my homepage using foxfire has incorrect appearance with some items apparently unresolved. The java console shows numerous errors. Weather channel info missing several pictures such as clouds in sky. I have used fixfire since it first became available and problem shows ip with fozfire 1.5.0.6.0.7,0.8 and foxfire 2.0.System is XP SP2 with all "criticals" installed. Errors do not occur with IE7 OR MOZILLA !! So something has screwed up foxfire's ability to display my yahoo homepage and certain other pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.on my ID I log onto "my yahoo". Homepage is missing some info with other pages showing red dots instead of pictures or artifacts.Yahoo is my homepage.Amazon pages are incomplete.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
I have re-installed several different versions of foxfire from 1.5.0.4 (?)thru foxfire 2.0. same error all the time.

IE6 and IE7 both display correct homepage (I delete IE7 to get ie6).MOZILLA also works but I don't like Mozilla (sorry).

Expected Results:  
NOTE..this bug is real in my XPSP2 system. I have 2 gig ram and so much harddrive space I cannot imagine any possible hardware constraint. My system is "squeaky clean" and has never had virus, trojan,or worm to my knowledge as I run numerous checkers weekly.

Basically I installed IE7 from microsoft and several versions of foxfire all show the same problem. pages are missing icons or pictures..usually a small red dot where info should be. I have used "system restore" (relatively not good product) and re-installed IE7 and various versions of foxfire. I LOVE foxfire but it isnt working and there is ALWAYS a java script console error log with many "declaration dropped" messages.

I trouble shot software with IBM for 20 years and don't know how to attempt to fix bug myself!! Yahoo, Amazon, and other pages do not display properly.

Have you tried:

- Firefox's safe-mode to exclude extension problems
- a new profile
- a reinstall in a new empty directory?

I sent separate e-mail today confirming that the "profile" folder was the culprit. Your quick reply was  very accurate and I had no idea that the profile folder was so well hidden!! Basically I renamed the whole FOXFIRE folder (to preserve it in case) and did complete install of 2.0 with all previous traces gone. Seems to me the profile folder was directly accessible 2 or 3 years ago..at least I remember fooling with it. Again THANKS..Bob
