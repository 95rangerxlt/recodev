r=me, but can you file a followup to purge mode="text" / mode="full" selectors from the CSS, too? We should do this only when we've merged to m-c though, because otherwise we'll just end up merging in more... :-(

I'm not sure what this means...

So, AIUI, we should get rid of mode="full" or mode="text" selectors, because they're now useless, as we're always using mode="icons". However, we *did* get rid of them - but because we merge stuff from m-c, I noticed that there are still/again selectors in the UX tree which use these (that presumably got merged in from m-c). As they don't actually hurt much apart from the infinitesimal amount of extra time spent checking if those selectors match, we should probably wait with doing a last purge of the never-matching selectors until we've merged to m-c.
