Noticed the the fonts lists have no fonts in them on Firebird 0.7.  Tracked it
down to a checking by Blake Ross on 09 Aug.  Unfortunately, there is no
reference as to why the change was made, only "Fix yet another font issue." 
Don't know what that issue is.

The specific issue is that the "userResolution" menuitem was #ifdefed out for
OS/2, but still referenced by Javascript, causing an exception.  In the end, the
code to populate the fonts lists was never called.  The way in works in
Thunderbird and Seamonkey is that "userResolution" is set 'hidden', but it is
still in the XUL file.

patch

Since Thunderbird and Seamonkey work just fine with the old code, this patch
just backs out the changes to the working state.

Brian, do you do super reviews for Firebird?  If so, could you take a look at
the patch?
To heck with it.

Fix is checked in.

I'm tired of waiting.
mkaply, requirements for checkin to Firebird don't include superreview, so 
there's part of the problem!  you might want to poke hyatt about a specific 
policy for OS/2-specific checkins for Firebird, such as you can review for 
those etc
sorry for bugspam, long-overdue mass reassign of ancient QA contact bugs,
filter on "beltznerLovesGoats" to get rid of this mass change
