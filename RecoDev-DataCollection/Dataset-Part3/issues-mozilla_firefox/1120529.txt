There have been a number of design attempts to integrate synced tabs into the product, which have all by now done the equivalent of bitrotting. Let's de-rot them before implementation.

for context: Bug 996638
To be more specific - two items of business:

1. Does this design still make sense given other changes to the browser since this time (i.e. saving for later, sharing, sending, streaming, etc.).
2. Are there ways to avoid having another button in the primary toolbar.

The answers to these might be yes and no, respectively, meaning no change to the spec, but we should review and be sure.
My proposal suggests including a menu item in the toolbar only when synced tabs exist https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=988323

Do we have mockups for what the linked about:sync page is suppose to look like?
John even has some code, and from what I recall, it looked really good.

I can't find the mockups for the about:sync page.  Should we open a separate bug for that?  The current state is not good.
here are the jgruen mockups:
