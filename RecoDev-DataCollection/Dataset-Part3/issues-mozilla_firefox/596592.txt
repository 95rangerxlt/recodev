nsISessionStore::setWindowState resurrects a window that was closed at the time of the getWindowState.

The browser-chrome mochitest  browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js
does something like this:

  let stateBackup = ss.getWindowState(window);
  // do a bunch of tests ...
  ss.setWindowState(window, stateBackup, true);

the problem is that when restoring the 'stateBackup' a window that was
closed at the time of the 'getWindowState()' is opened.

This is what bit me in bug 449734.  The tests I add in that bug create
a tab, detaches it using 'replaceTabWithWindow', and finally close
the new window.  My tests work fine when run individually, but when
running the whole browser-chrome suite "browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js"
which runs some 40 or 50 tests later, resurrected a window from my test.

I have combined the essence of the two tests into a new test to demonstrate
the problem, see the attached patch.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. apply the attached patch
2. rebuild browser/base/content/test/
3. run "mochitest --browser-chrome --autorun
--test=browser/base/content/test/browser_setWindowState_BUG.js"

WORKAROUND
After you 'close()' the window created by 'replaceTabWithWindow' you can do:
Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Ci.nsISessionStore).forgetClosedWindow(0);
to avoid it causing a problem with 'get/setWindowState' later.

Just from a quick glance, I'm going to guess this is related to turning a window into a popup and/or the fact that you're calling setWindowState with an empty state. Though I guess that's the private browsing test, not you.

And I bet the problem is actually showing up after you do pb.enabled = false, which calls ss.setBrowserState. We have code that make sures a non-popup is reopened if the last window was a popup (on Windows) when restoring.
You're right, leaving PB is what creates the window, not setWindowState.
The bug occurs on Windows and Linux, but not OSX.
The problem does not occur if I remove this block:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStore.js#1953

The code is probably fine, I can't reproduce the problem with normal
usage of the browser.  So, I suggest we should just fix the test.

Looks OK to me, but I'll give it to ehsan since it's in a PB test and that's him.

I'm thinking it might be a good idea to fix this properly, such that setBrowserState doesn't follow the one-non-popup rule. I filed bug 597071 for that and know exactly how it should be fixed & tested.

I don't have time to fix it this second, so I'll support this workaround for now.
Looking more like we want this ASAP. That test seems to be causing an issue for a tab candy test as well (since it opens a window, then closes it). All the more reason to fix it properly...

r=me if you add a comment pointing out that this needs to be removed once bug 597071 is fixed.
Added a comment in the testcase, and in bug 597071.
