Currently accel-shift-o opens the setting pane in the tools, but using the binding again does nothing. I think it should be a toggle binding - using the binding again should return the user to the previous tool pane they were using.

Chrome currently binds F1 to the settings, then the only way to get back for them is to hit escape. This makes sense as they are using a pop-over visual design, we instead are essentially treating settings as a 'special tab' in the toolbox so I think the toggle works better.

I've also logged bug 1198339 as a proposal to bind F1.

Agreed that ctrl+shift+o should toggle settings.  Should F1 do the same once it's added?

Yup, sorry that wasn't clear.
This will need something like switchToPreviousHost has, where we keep track of the last used tool in a pref.  Right now we are only keeping track of the currently used tool under LAST_TOOL: "devtools.toolbox.selectedTool"
Actually, this probably doesn't need to be stored in a pref, it could just be stored in memory on the toolbox

Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)
[Why is this notable]: suggested by dev tools team for aurora users
[Suggested wording]:  Ctrl+shift+o and F1 now toggle between settings pane and last used dev tool
[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]:

Brian, do you have nicer wording for this? Thanks!

Jeff, what do you think?
That seems fine to me.
I've noted this in:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Keyboard_shortcuts#Toolbox
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Tools_Toolbox#Settings_2

OK?

Thanks!  I think in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Tools_Toolbox#Settings_2 you could replace the '(from Firefox 43, this also toggles between the active tool and the Settings pane)' with 'to toggle between the active tool and the Settings pane' so it matches the F1 note above.  Or could merge both of those into a single point:

* Press F1 (new in Firefox 43) or Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O to toggle between the active tool and the Settings pane.

OK, thanks Brian, I've gone with your v1. Actually it is a bit misleading, since that implies that you could *toggle* using Ctrl+Shift+O before Firefox 43, but I don't think that's true, right? But I doubt anyone will really object, and it makes the wording less tortured.

Exactly - the original was more correct, but I don't think it's too important of a distinction
