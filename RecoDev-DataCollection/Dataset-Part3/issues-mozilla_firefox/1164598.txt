Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: 1167252, the new performance tool
[User impact if declined]: Won't ship the performance tool
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: There are try pushes in Bug 1167252 with all patches needing uplift
[Risks and why]: Requesting uplift for the accumulated changes in the performance tool since the 40 merge date, so these changes haven't had the full 6 weeks to bake.  Risks are generally contained within devtools, specifically within the performance panel.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/0fe415e2576e
Note: I had verbal confirmation for these uplifts from Sylvestre even before he's flagged them as a+.  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1167252#c26
