Could you try the basic troubleshooting steps, please:
1) safe mode: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-using-safe-mode
2) fresh profile: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles
i'm confirming this due to the number of similar questions we see in support. reportedly safemode doesn't help but a new profile does. some affected users have figured that it's related to their places.sqlite file.

That would explain why a Firefox refresh doesn't fix the problem but removing the places.sqlite file from the Firefox profile(or creating a new  profile) does .... as reported in this thread:

What is the output needed please. Is it JS & Net Errors ?

I have tried asking some of the people in sumo threads for more information and will wait for responses.
If you wish to post your own responses & questions note the quick registration link is 
https://support.mozilla.org/users/authcontributor 

Please mention in this bug when you have the required information, because the majority posting support mozilla questions will probably find it rather inconvenient trying to provide error output, naturally enough they are looking for quick simple fixes.

IIRC from the mozillazine & sumo threads some have tried that without success already.

My own responses in some sumo threads has asked some affected to backup the profile & places sqlite, and others will still have original places.sqlites.
Presumably we could email to Vladan, that would address any privacy concerns because the data would be going to a mozilla address, then NI Vladan to check for the emails.

javascript errors.

well, mak AT mozilla.com works :)
I suspect there's a relation with keywords changes, when text is entered in the locationbar we ask the keywords API about it, it's likely it is throwing for some reason.

The reason could be related to a bogus migration after bug 1125113, that is, the database contained or contains some unexpected data that confuses the API.

PS: I got mine running btw.
Following the steps here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/doc ... leshooting) I managed to get a repaired version of my places.sqlite db. When I overwrote the corrupt one with it, in my v39 installation, the problem was gone.

The db is now almost half the size than it used to be (61+mb -> 39mb), I don't know what's missing now...
But since I'm not seeing anything that's obviously missing, I'm good.
Umh... scratch that last one... :(
I got my versions mixed up, it was v38.0.5 where it was working fine (naturally). Error still persists in v39

Dammit, I didn't mean to send the 2015-07-07 09:43:25 PDT comment about me being mistaken, that message must've been stuck behind the scenes somehow... THAT was me being mistaken, it DOES work; just had overwritten the working copy.

(the system told me something about "mid-air collision" and asked me what I wanted to do, so I chose "only send my latest comment" - but it was ambiguously phrased, and it sent the older message too.

Can I remove the older comment somehow?
Happy that the troubleshooting page I wrote is useful and you could recover your database. I will look into the file you sent me, off-hand looks like real corruption and somehow we actually hit that corruption with 39 changes. Will let you know.

Oh that was you too! :) Thank you so much, your help is very much appreciated and goes a long way :)

->

and so on. The console started as sqlite3> too.

How come this way of just salvaging the usable entries aren't part of a standard routine? It seems like many people would be happy with just that, if the alternative is to throw the whole db away.

Thought: let FF offer to salvage usable data, set a flag, backup the old file, recover the working entries. Upon restart, offer to restore the backup, until the user accepts a version -> turn off the flag.

First I need to know what is throwing and why, I got some dbs by mail and will look at those today. Some kind of corruptions are not recoverable.

I don't know yet, I'm head down in the awesomebar work, on the other side some performance work will affect also the awesomebar so I'm trying to make that re-enter there.
I don't think I have time to work on auto-fixing corrupt databases though. We should basically reimplement the code in comment 19. the hard part is figuring how to detect corruption and when to handle it.
This bug priority is only marked as normal. 
Yet those affected are unable to use Firefox and the problem is not fixed by a clean reinstall unless the profile is deleted. It is not fixed by a Firefox Refresh.

End users have resorted to deleting profiles or places and those are not very good solutions as they result in important data loss.

What is the fix to recommend for end users ?
From comment 18 & comment 19 following steps in MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/places.sqlite_Database_Troubleshooting fixes the issue.
Which actual steps are needed ? 

Would exporting bookmarks HTML renaming places and reimporting be likely to work and have minimal data loss ?

All of them, provided the problem is a database corruption.

just removing places.sqlite and letting firefox generate a new one should do the same, it will lose history, but bookmarks should be restored properly.
(In reply to John Hesling [:John99] from comment #26)
> Would exporting bookmarks HTML renaming places and reimporting be likely to

Well, no, as the whole history would be gone after that, and all the functions relying upon it, like the auto complete functionality (You would only get suggestions out of your bookmarks).
Maybe that's not important for many users, and it's a question of weighing time+effort against results, but technically, the loss isn't "minimal" this way.
(In reply to John Hesling [:John99] from comment #26)
> What is the fix to recommend for end users ?
I would also recommend just removing places.sqlite and letting Firefox generate a new one, as outlined here: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Locked_or_damaged_places.sqlite#Rebuild_Places_database
This results in lost history but bookmarks should be restored from the latest JSON bookmarkbackup.
Thanks for the quick reply.

I guess I was also trying to ask the likely impact and damage of this problem.
It is not picked up in crash stats and breaks Firefox totally.
Many affected users may not be able to report the issue.
Many affected users may simply be migrating to an alternative browser.
Presumably any fix will take time and then ride the trains.

I realise a regression is involved, but presumably the places corruption is likely to be an ongoing occurrence. Presumably we will continue to get new cases of broken Firefox over time until the bug is fixed.

Our suggested workaround destroys History. End users will often not realise that will affect the awesomebar, and presumably the new tiles.

Yes I realised that after I had posted.
I was trying to think about any recent bookmarks that would be lost. But if that were a concern to a particular end user just exporting as HTML and using that as a searchable file probably suffices.   
Anyhow that is an edge case, and may be resolvable by your troubleshooting steps. 
Loosing recent bookmarks probbaly is not a great problem

4% of the users have at least one keyword, and this issue only affects a small percentage of those having some particular setup that I'm investigating. Moreover users using keywords are usually more technical savvy, so they know how to ask for help. So it should be a very tiny percentage of disruption. If this issue would be more common, we'd have noticed it in Nightly/Aurora/Beta already, where we have many technical users using keywords.

We have tools already in the product for corruption handling, and bookmarks backups. We can't predict some sort of corruptions, cause they are often bound to system issues, memory faults, disk faults, antivirus software and other external causes. So a pretty good and normal fix in some cases can become an issue.

> I was trying to think about any recent bookmarks that would be lost.

Bookmarks are backed up every day by default.
One of the databases I got through e-mail allowed me to figure out a workaround for the problem.

Thanks to everyone who sent me their files I also could confirm the issue is not due to the schema change in Firefox 39, but rather to the fact urlbar code in Firefox 39 makes evident pre-existing database corruptions.

All of the databases I received had some sort of corruptions, that can be handled (at the moment) through the small tutorial I put here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/places.sqlite_Database_Troubleshooting

So, the fix here will workaround the problem by making the locationbar work (so one can browser to search for a solution), but it won't fix the underlying corruption problem, for that you must check the above link, or if you don't care about history just throw away places.sqlite and let Firefox generate a new one.
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Currently if places.sqlite is corrupt the location bar stops working completely, it's not possible to use Firefox to browse the Web and look for a solution.

I don't know how old are the corruptions and I can't know, the code that exposed them to the locationbar landed in 39, bug 1125113.
Note this patch will only workaround the problem making the location bar work, we can't fix such kind of corruptions at the moment.

I take it that means that the issue of the location bar not functioning in this circumstance is a regression in 39.

Understood.
Hi, everyone:

I used SQLite manager on my places.sqlite and executed a Check Integrity --> Complete Check - which, if I understand correctly, is the PRAGMA integrity_check - and it did not find anything.  However, I guess I'm the one that started the original thread in the Mozillazine forums.  Would you like a copy of the file so you can dissect it?

Hi,

what happens if you run FF after you removed / renamed your places.sqlite? Does the problem still persist?

if YES -> different problem source after all, or additional bug
if NO -> problem not down to traditional corruption
I have to ask, how many of the folks reporting corruption issues use CCleeaner or some other 3rd party application to 'clean up' Firefox ?

CCleaner has been known for some time to not play nice with Firefox.

it must return the string "ok" if it doesn't return anything, it's still a sign of corruption.
