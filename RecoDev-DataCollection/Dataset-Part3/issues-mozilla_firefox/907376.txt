Since bug 871203 landed, we have an Exit button in the panel. When in Customization Mode, this button might appear to (falsely) suggest it'll take you out of that mode, while instead it will close the browser.

To circumvent misinterpretations of this feature and remedy confusion, the exit button should be disabled.

Actually, nit: please add the rule above the existing one so as not to break blame.
FTFM

I can't do that. I've never heard of rule that should break code-consistency over supporting lack of intelligence in tooling. #PanelUI-help is ALWAYS above #PanelUI-quit in that file, so to break that consistency for the sake of tooling is not gonna fly.

As a side note, blame is preserved in VCS revision history. In the current toolchain (like hg.mozilla.org code browser, annotation view), it's a couple of clicks extra to check out the parent revision and blame from there. It might be less convenient.

Well, I couldn't really see that from the patch context. I also don't think that consistency is particularly important, but I can't bring myself to care much either way. Land it whichever way around you think is best.
