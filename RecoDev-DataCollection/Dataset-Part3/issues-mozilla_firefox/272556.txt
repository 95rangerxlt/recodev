chrome://global/content/about.xhtml works fine.
But nsAbout.cpp still references chrome://global/locale/about.xhtml:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/appshell/src/nsAbout.cpp#51

That's because bug 257592 changed that on the branch only.

about: doesn't do anything for me. It doesn't work, but it's not the same as
about:blank either. Typing it simply has no effect (i.e. if a page is loaded, it
won't clear it).
Comment 0 is wrong (I tried it in a new tab, which already had about:blank
loaded in it).
about: does just nothing.

This breaks about: for Seamonkey:

We need to decide where about.xhtml should live: in content, or in locale. Then
we can make it work (again) for both Seamonkey and Firefox.

Move about.xhtml to content

There isn't really any localizable content in this file. Let's just move it to
content/. Otherwise, we could possibly use the license.dtd scheme that the
toolkit uses, but that's arcane and I regret doing it that way.
Some people like to translate the copyright lines for their language, but I'd
also prefer to have the document in content, and eventually move the
localizeable parts/texts to some .dtd file (like I did for the seamonkey
mailnews start file) - but that can be done later, if needed.
Does the patch need a superreview?
The review for the patch is here. Does it need a superreview or just a volunteer
to check it in?

It would be nice if this was committed it has both a review and superreview.
Anybody going to be able to check it in?
It would be best before we get bitrotten.
