Since we want to promote lightweight themes more aggressively, we should fix some of the visual glitches they currently have on Windows and Linux in windowed mode.

We can't draw inside the window border directly (yet), so we'll need to design our way around this limitation.

To summarize the issues & solution:

1. Undefined border on both side of the tab area on Win 8 & Win 7.
We should add a transparent 1px grey border on both side of the theme (on the tab area), the color value is the same as the border between the current tab & the background. See attachment attachment 8456462 and attachment 8456464 above.

2. On Windows 8, the theme is one pixel off to the left, I'm not sure whether we can draw inside the window frame but if we can, we should move the theme to the right for 1px. There is also one weird pixel in the close button that we should get rid of, see attachment 8427715 (if you look really close, there is a weird blue pixel inside the red close button)

3. On Windows 7, we don't have to have the 1px border since there's a blue window frame, but we should give the theme a rounded corner to match the window itself.

I think issue #1 is a blocker for shipping this, and the rest are "nice to have". Also after some discussion we think we are pretty ok on Linux.

There is more to fix, see bug 929986.
