Our tests are throwing an exception on social_panel.html accessing mozSocial.  This is caused when our tests remove the test provider prior to the panel finishing it's load.  The test code is setting a status panel during social.initialize, but none of the tests are verifying it is ready or shutdown, except the one test that uses it.

On occasion, it is also showing up during try runs for unrelated social patches.
