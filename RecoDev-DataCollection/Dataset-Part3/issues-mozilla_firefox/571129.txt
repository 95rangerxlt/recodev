contextMenuSearchText=Search %S for "%S"

For proper localization into Ukrainian, Russian and surely some other languages, the position of search engine name and query should be swapped.

Please make it possible.

Potential patch

This patch works for me, though I have no idea if it's enough. Tim, can you give it a try?
Why does en-US string need to change? Can't you just use the positional arguments in your localization?

(Adding the positional arguments in the en-US makes it clearer which string is which when you're translating, so it may be worth doing anyways, but I don't think it's necessary to get the result you need.)

Do you mean that en-US can use "%S" and "%S" and localizations can use "%1$S" and "%2$S" instead? I have no idea that it's supported and safe to use (is it documented somewhere?).
Besides, I'm not sure that compare-locales and l10n dashboard support it.

With l10n note added.

Potential patch v.2

Adding the numbers is fine as a hint, and adding a localization note would be really good.

But, "%S foo %S" and "%1$S foo %2$S" are totally equivalent, and you can use positional arguments in your localization independently of whether en-US uses them or not.

Once compare-locales and the dashboard will support param checks, they will know about this equivalence and deal with it rightly. As in, the not yet ready code I have locally does deal with it OK.

I'd welcome a patch with just the note and the positions, but without the key change, personally.

For what it's worth, we (it, Italian) have been using positional arguments in this string for years without problems with compare-locales.

Patch v.3

Without the key change.

Patch v.3

r=me with a nit, I'd reference %1$S instead of 1st string, %2$S instead of 2nd explicitly, as first and second become confusing for locales that chnage the order.
