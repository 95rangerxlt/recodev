ends up handling load event from iframes although it doesn't expect it.

Patch coming.

Mats, I think you wrote the test long ago for bug 449734.

Looks like browser_tab_dragdrop2.js has a similar issue:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_tab_dragdrop2.js?rev=574b0fb35604#21
(added on window_B.gBrowser, removed on window_B)
which might explain bug 598294?
