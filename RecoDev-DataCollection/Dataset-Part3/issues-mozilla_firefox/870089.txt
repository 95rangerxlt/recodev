We need to update the page for:

http://support.mozilla.org/1/firefox/22.0a1/Darwin/en-US/social-api

It currently redirects to a facebook specific page.

Thanks, Shane. 

What is the origin of this link? I'm trying to figure out the user experience so we can change the content/link accordingly.

When you activate a provider, you get an undo panel.  That panel has a link for "Learn More..." which loads the url in the description, which redirects to the url in comment 1.  This exists in all versions of Fx with social.

As of Fx23, there is also a menu item in the toolbarbutton to load that page.
@Verdi - seems like a new (if one doesn't already exist) SUMO page could come in handy here. The objective would be to provide a generic overview of how the Social API works. Just like the Facebook page, but provider agnostic. Do we have something like that already?
We don't have a generic overview yet. We're just now beginning Firefox 22 documentation. I'll create this article and make sure sumodev changes the redirect when 22 is released.

Multiple provider is actually landing in Firefox 21 next Tuesday. Is it possible to have at least a english page up by then? Sorry for the late notice.

Yes!
The learn more link now resolves to http://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-services-add-social-features-your-browser so I think we call this fixed.

And it is very nice!  I'll have a couple follow up bugs to add some information, but we can close this one.
