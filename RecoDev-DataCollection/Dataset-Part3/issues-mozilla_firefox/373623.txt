I am unsure how this should be percolated to l10ns.

Aaron, is there an a11y-impact of ... vs &hellip; ?
There could very likely be, because the text-to-speech engines that screen readers use may not be able to handle this. We'd have to do a lot of testing and communication with screen readers to find out.

If this is important, go ahead and check it in to trunk and we'll see what happens.
Also, I forgot to mention Braille displays. Screen readers control Braille displays like these:
http://www.deafblind.com/display.html

The Braille translation engine probably does not know that unicode symbol.
The unicode '…' symbol is already widely used in Sunbird (though not always consequently), e.g. http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/calendar/locales/en-US/chrome/calendar/menuOverlay.dtd

Sunbird hasn't been tested for accessibility yet. This is going to take a fair amount of testing.

I'm not trying to kill your patch, just saying how it is.
Do other popular, accessible apps on Windows and Gnome already use this symbol? If so then it's probably safe.

> The Braille translation engine probably does not know that unicode symbol.

Then the developers of those engines have some work to do.  I say this is not our problem.

Seeing the symbol being used in Sunbird is indeed the reason for this patch.

Can I get an answer to my question in comment 7?

If it's already used all over the place, then it's obviously not an issue.
If it's not used, then we're just being different because we can. I'm not sure why we'd want our ... to look different from what other apps have.

Hendrik, welcome to the world of accessibility. Like I said I'm not trying to kill your patch but Axel asked a great question. Is it a problem? Very possibly.

We don't have time to test the zillion screen readers, text-to-speech and Braille display engines out there to create the proper gap analysis :/ Hence comment 7.
How is this different than bug 365624?
Also note bug 255051 - ellipsis should /not/ be used everywhere ! (but then there should be no dot-dot-dot either)
Aaron, see bug 365624, which I agree this is probably a dupe of. The Apple HIG says that the ellipsis character is better for accessibility than the three dots. 
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGText/chapter_13_section_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000365-DontLinkElementID_218

bug 255051 is about whether or not to use ellipsis on some places.  This bug is about using the proper symbol *if* ellipsis are used.  Thus they are only very loosely related.
*** Bug 365624 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I saw you assigned it to me, that’s fine, but note that my contribution to this bug is finished now.  I have no cvs commit permissions.
Not having write access is no barrier to having the bug assigned - along with begging your eventual reviewer for checkin, or asking on IRC, you can always add [checkin needed] to the Whiteboard field.

But before that you need review per http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/review.html and before you can ask for review, you or someone interested in seeing this land needs to come up with a reasonably authoritative answer to comment 7 - do other popular accessible apps on Windows and Linux use ellipses rather than three dots?

I tested this in the two most popular screen-readers.  In both cases, they recognized the ellipses symbol for what it was, using speech.  I'm reasonably certain that I remember the same applying to braille, but I'll need to do some checking to coroborate this.  However, in the menu overlay for Sunbird, here's what came across for one of the menu entries that I presume is supposed to have an ellipses.
 <!ENTITY calendar.open.file.label               "Open Calendar Fileâ€¦">
What's with the junk at the end of that?  My screen-readers tell me "A circumflex, euro, vertical bar".  If that's supposed to be the ellipses symbol, I have some additional testing to do to reconcile the differences between these two cases.
Interesting. On an intel mac with 10.4.9, VoiceOver reports all of these menu options as ending with "ellipsis".

version: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3pre) Gecko/20070315 Calendar/0.5pre
Tim, when you say "they recognized the ellipses symbol for what it was", does that mean they speak something different from  the "...". It won't be confusing for screen reader users will it?
Having tested in Sunbird, the menu entries with ellipses don't read the same as menu entries with dot-dot-dot.  The AT products do recognize the ellipses, however, they just don't automatically read it if you're arrowing through a menu.  Bottom line: this patch could be applied without negatively affecting the ability of Jaws/Window-eyes/screen magnifier users' to use the application.  A minor tweak on the AT developer side should allow users to get consistent feedback regardless of whether a tripple dot or an ellipses is used.  Braille translation tables include the ellipses symbol, so there's no reason it should negatively affect them either.  I recall from my Apple System 7 days that Mac applications always used the ellipses, or at least most of the time, so it doesn't surprise me that Voiceover reads them correctly.  On the Linux side, even if the AT products don't recognize the ellipses, it won't cause users to be unable or less able to use the application.

It won't be confusing for a screen-reader user.  The menu will read the same with the same voice inflection, but it won't read the dot-dot-dot at the end.  Different users have different punctuation settings, and even between Firefox and Internet Explorer, I get different menu behavior.
So, if it's important to interproduct look and feel, this patch could be applied without negatively affecting screen-reader users.  If the only purpose is because the ellipses symbol looks better, I would think the "if it ain't broke..." rule applies.

Here's my takeaway, which is slightly different I think:
- It is different but not something users can't figure out, but it does say something sensible.
- We'll have to tell AT vendors to change their code, if we want it to be the same, which they probably won't because they have bigger issues. 
- It's not enough of a reason for users to upgrade to a newer AT
- Many Windows screen reader users will still have the older AT no matter what, and hear something different in our app than they normally hear. Since it's different some small number of users who are less tech-savvy might be confused initially, but will get used to it.
- This is in fact different from what other Windows apps are doing.

All and all it's not a huge deal either way, but might annoy some. Then again since it's not really a big deal we probably shouldn't hold up the patch. 
My last comment was written before I read your comment 23.

Anwyay, I'm a little confused now. Ellipses don't get spoken or do?

If they're not spoken, why won't screen reader users be confused? Don't they need to know the ... is there so they know when something will open a dialog? It's the same queue sighted users get.
Which screen reader are you asking about?

If VoiceOver on a Mac (10.4.9, intel) is given "Open File..." (with three dots), it says "Open File, ellipsis".

If it is given "Open File..." (with ellipses), it says "Open File, ellipsis".

Yes, but most  blind users have textual punctuation turned off, so they don't hear the dot-dot-dot, they only rely on the inflection of the speech.  With ellipses, this inflection is the same.  Some will not hear the dot-dot-dot, and might be confused initially.   
So, My thinking is that while it might raise an eyebrow, the user will still know what that particular menu function or button will do.  There are many situations where buttons have the three dots on the end of them, but this is not read by screen-readers because of the default punctuation setting.  In these cases the ellipses would make no difference, as users would hear the same voice inflection.  

Regardless,  if no other applications use this symbol, I don't understand why we would want to defy convention in that way.  

Ray, VoiceOver users are not yet common, as most blind users are still on Windows. Historically, that's where the most complete access has been, by far.

So generally we're talking about Window-Eyes and JAWS. Hal/Supernova is also used on Windows, a bit less commonly, and it doesn't work with Firefox. A newer option is NVDA, an open source screen reader for Windows.

That's UTF-8 being treated as Windows-1252 - lxr doesn't specify an encoding, so if you don't have autodetect on (View - Character Encoding - Autodetect - Universal) you'll get it in your OS's default encoding. Not a problem when it's being used, only when it's being displayed as a web page.

Which is where the relationship to bug 255051 that Hendrik is sure doesn't exist comes in: ellipses do not mean "this will open a dialog" but rather "you will have to provide more information before the action this item's label suggests will actually happen." Since both users and developers are uniformly confused about the correct meaning, it's not that strong of a cue - even for the exact same action going through the exact same UI, ellipsis-or-not varies from one application to another.
(In reply to comment #27)
> Regardless,  if no other applications use this symbol, I don't understand why

Since technology evolves.  In the old days, three dots was the way to express an ellipsis, because there was no other option, or because one had no access to the correct glyph.  Now, in the days of Unicode, we can do better.

I did iconv -f utf-8 -t cp1252 *.properties in all three installer folders.  It gave no error message.  The ellipsis was not visible on my console, but it was if I saved the result in a temp file and opened it with cp1252 encoding, so I think this is fine.

Looks good. r=sipaq

Please contact me before checking this in, as this will have to be committed to the Mozilla 1.8 branch as well and only after we lift our current string freeze.
For all three patches, i.e. 
browser
mail
calendar
You still need review and approval for browser and toolkit.
And I don't think calendar has lifted their string freeze yet.

Looks like your "mail & editor" patch is actually just mail, which is probably a good thing, since editor has different owners/peers than mail. You probably want to unobsolete your editor patch, and get Neil to r+sr it.

But the mail patch, which seems to be the only thing that's actually ready for checkin-needed, has gotten enough bit-rot that it no longer applies - you'll probably find it easier to get someone to check it in if you attach an unrotted version.
Don't forget that this bug is trying to fix a moving target. Since the last patch, there have been other changes in the GUI that also need a change to \U2026 : bug 400237.

Also note that bug 400237 comment 3 complains that \U2026 is too wide in the Japanese MS UI Gothic font.

patch for browser locales, tested

Ok, I decided to do this properly now.

1. I checked out a fresh wc yesterday.  (with make client.mk co and project=browser)
2. I replaced all ... by … in all .dtd and .properties files, without looking at them.
3. I went through all matches of ... in all files (about 10 000) and evaluated whether they should be replaced.  I tried
  - not to replace them in comments
  - to replace them in print statements etc.
Some have definitely escaped my scrutiny, but I am rather confident I got it right.  The test build survived.
4. Noticing that there is some code which inserts ... in certain places, I edited that code as well, as far as I was confident enough with what it was doing.
5. I split up the diff in 5 patches:
  - locale: all the stuff which is in a locales/ directory.  These should be unproblematic.  Dots in comments are probably replaced here as well.
  - code: the parts where I changed stuff other than just dots; please review this a bit more thoroughly
  - locale-other: for some strange reason, the inspector contains locales for other languages than en-US.  I put these in a separate patch since I am unsure what has to happen with them.
  -misc: here is all the stuff from other directories.  These are mainly c and js files with print or debug statements.  Also configure files, readmes, docs and htmls (bug descriptions, mostly).  For some of those files, I had to convert them to UTF-8, but I think that is an Eclipse issue.  It doesn’t show up in the patch.  If this is a problem, let me know what I can do about it.

You probably want to consider whether you want to check-in the misc stuff, since a lot of it is command-line interaction, which uses fixed-width fonts, and … in fixed-width looks ugly.  But of course I’d prefer it to be done!

I hope to find some time in the near future to go through the same routine for TB and SM. 

The above was two weeks ago.  Just in time I thought about building and testing first.  It segfaulted during startup.  Probably since I did some file encoding conversions.  So I made a fresh checkout again and am now testing the patches.

This is the one for locales, which probably does not need another review, but I’ll ask it anyway.  I guess it should not be contested.  The others will follow soon.

Because I can?  I checked out the code needed for browser and changed all occurrences of three dots that are inside strings in ellipsis.  There is one more patch coming up, which does all the strings which are not in l10n files.  But since you are sceptical here already (which I expected, btw): does it make sense?

No, I don't think changing debug output makes sense. As for txt and html files, it depends on whether they're part of the UI.

Firefox isn't the only product Mozilla has in its CVS repository. Just because it isn't part of Firefox doesn't mean it shouldn't be fixed. Mozilla isn't completely Firefox-centric.

This is a Firefox bug to start with. Who says that the SeaMonkey guys want that change? Robert Kaiser certainly didn't want it. Also, whoever patches xpfe should patch all files, not a few random ones.

True.  However, from IRC, it seems that Robert has accepted the inevitable and is willing to do this for SM as well.  Since there already were reviews accepted for TB and SB, I guess in the long run the whole codebase will/should be done.

That said, I am open for a better methodology, if somebody /please/ explain it to me.  Like I mentioned above, I just checked out browser and changed all file that came with it.  I am planning to do the same for mail, calendar and suite, in that order, but first things should be resolved here.  And yes, I will make separate bugs.

I talked to Axel, the inspector locales should not be patched.  However, there are 4 files for en-US in that patch which should be patched here.  I guess I’d make a new patch for locales which integrates those?  I’ll wait for review and comments first.

Those are real bugs, please move those ellipsis to the respective DTD, having them in XUL is plain wrong, as locaizers need to be able to localize them, e.g. in Japanese that character often renders wrong in fonts so they might be better off with using three dots in their L10n - but that's completly up to localizers, so it should be in DTDs.

The rest in this "misc patch" is probably stuff that shouldn't change. Comment and test fixes are unnecessary and just require that anyone editing the source file has a unicode editor but don't give us any other win, and the prints, etc. go out to the console and I'm not convinced we should require all users to have unicode console fonts on their various system consoles.
(In reply to comment #69)

Just leave it alone. xpfe/ strings are completely unused now, except for places where Camino still uses them, and they will abandon them hopefully soon as well, when we'll just remove them. No need to patch stuff that is almost completely unused.

BTW, SeaMonkey will want this as well - while it's right that I don't particularly like it, being inconsistent between toolkit and SeaMonkey strings is even much worse ;-)

Cheers Reed, for finally getting this done!

However, as I feared, you forgot the three en-US files in the obsoleted inspector patch.  Could you please do them as well?

I will try to handle the comments of Robert soon, and will then advance to doing the same thing for TB.
Was the first part of comment #76 ever split into a separate bug? It is an obvious discrepancy on the Help menu.
Argh. Thanks for screwing the ChatZilla locale files without even consulting us - none of the core team are CCed, none have commented, or even been asked AFAICT.

Search and replace is NOT your friend.

First of all, all the cmd.*.params changes have BROKEN their respective commands. Secondly, a lot of the changes outside of cmd.*.label are not used in menus/GUI elements, and really shouldn't have been changed without consultation first.

I've a right mind to just back out the entire set of changes that were applied to ChatZilla, but I will at least discuss it with the other ChatZilla developers first.

(There's also something wrong with ChatZilla being clobbered by a Firefox: General bug, of all things.)
I should note that the above comment implies to Venkman as well. This is pretty much sev: critical as far as I'm concerned, because ChatZilla and Venkman are now mostly unusable on trunk. Please either come up with a patch that fixes the params strings at least, or back out the changes to extensions/irc and extensions/venkman, and file a followup bug to deal with problems you see there.

I explicitly stated above that the changes were done using search & replace.  From the strings, it is unclear that that change would break anything.  I find it strange that commands would depend from localizable strings.
And it is/was impossible to test all of this since it were such massive changes.

If I see it right, search & replace will be our friend here: by simply reverting all [<…>] back to [<...>], 99% of the problems should be solved.

Same thing for venkman.

Sorry though.

Then it would have been better if you'd stuck with your original plan of changing code that was tested (browser, mail, calendar), or at least alerted module owners/peers of the other things you were touching that you were going to do a mass change. Finally, it would be preferably to not lump all these changes together in a 300k patch and term that a "browser locale" patch, when it clearly isn't. I'm not sure why you changed your approach there anyway. Untested changes getting rubberstamped and checked in are bad.

You should probably use <...> and <…> for replacing - the [] braces indicate optionality, and there could be circumstances where they are not present (I don't think there are, though).Anyway, that just proves once more that search/replace without understanding the code you're changing is not really your friend... It would be smarter to look at your patch and revert the changes to .params, also because the <...> string could possibly occur in non-params strings. Slightly more work, sure, but smarter.

Thank you. Looking forward to that patch!

backout changes to irc, fix inspector

Ok, after some trying out, I came up with this patch.  It reverts the wrong changes to irc/.  As I said, simply undid all the <…>, replacing them with <...>.

Gijs already fixed Venkman (see dependant bug).

Furthermore, the patch contains the four files in inspector/ which Reed forgot.

You can have r+ from me on the CZ backout, but I can't say anything about inspector, so asking review from sdwilsh for those bits.

r=silver on the ChatZilla changes. Further changes are required, however.

Really stupid to include inspector changes in the same patch, though.

Even more. In Trunk there's still more than 500 places where those tripple dots are used. Some of these have only recently been added (e.g. but patches tu bug #394392 or bug #193001). Here's a quick grep for three dots in en-US directories. It's 550 lines, and I don't think many comments have slipped into that file.

That's 80% mail/news (which is in the patch here but has bitrotted and was apparently never checked in) - and some IRC and Venkman (which was backed out for good reasons, see above comments). The toolkit and penelope things should probably get their own bug. Which was true for just about everything in that list, actually, given this bug is in Firefox > General...
SeaMonkey also still has the triple dots everywhere (suite/ and, as Gijs mentioned, mailnews/)
Created attachment 299104
triple dots in *.js and *.cpp

This is result of searching triple dots in *.js and *.cpp in Firefox trunk7s source other than Comment, Extension, Test, Assertion, Log, Non-string ... (e.g. function declaration of C++).

Some of them may be needed to fix.
(In reply to comment #103)
> Some of them may be needed to fix.

Right, some of them. And some of them not. Comments and debug console output should probably not be changed, see also comment #76
For some reason Win 98 (NL, default) seems not to be able to display the (0x85) converted ellipsis very well for the installer and updater files Axel named in comment 49, or attachment 280210; they look like a vertical bar. As the current/upcoming Sunbird releases are still able to run on Win 98, I suppose it would be best to exclude them from Sunbird (yet). For the same reason, taking them in for Mozilla 1.8 branch may be not a good idea either.

I thought all this was done for trunk only anyways, where Win98 is unsupported - with this cross-commit policy in calendar, I see why this can get difficult though. At some point, when the calendar team gets serious about trunk, this will be needed there for consistency though.

This should not have been changed, as the comment says.

> This should not have been changed, as the comment says.

As we have just been discussing this on irc, I tend to disagree. I presume this change handles both comment and a text string _about_ code, not code itself that could do any harm. It’s fine when the ellipsis will be left out here though (as there are many other comment lines that still use dots), but I see no reason not to leave it in.

Hm, strange. I just checked the installer of the Lithuanian build in English Windows 98 running in VMware. Works like a charm.

Should I really revert those strings?

Trouble on ellipsis in updater's message is bug 405871.

The rationale for this patch from comment 107 doesn't hold, thus r-. Not that I have a strong opinion on either side.
