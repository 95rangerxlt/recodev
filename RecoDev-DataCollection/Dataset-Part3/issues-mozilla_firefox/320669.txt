Since it looks like we'll pretty much always be sending notifications for everything that happens in a batch operation, we should get rid of the extra API complexity of the wantAllDetails property on nsINavBookmarkObserver and nsINavHistoryObserver.

This has been removed from history as part of the resolution to bug 320666. Bookmark observers still need to be done.

Bug 451915 - move Firefox/Places bugs to Firefox/Bookmarks and History. Remove all bugspam from this move by filtering for the string "places-to-b-and-h".

In Thunderbird 3.0b, you do that as follows:
Tools | Message Filters
Make sure the correct account is selected. Click "New"
Conditions: Body   contains   places-to-b-and-h
Change the action to "Delete Message".
Select "Manually Run" from the dropdown at the top.
Click OK.

Select the filter in the list, make sure "Inbox" is selected at the bottom, and click "Run Now". This should delete all the bugspam. You can then delete the filter.
