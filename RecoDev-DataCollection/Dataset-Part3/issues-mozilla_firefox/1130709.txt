Steps to reproduce:

Try to build on a musl libc based system (http://musl-libc.org)


Actual results:

Compile failure in media/webrtc/signaling/src/sdp/sipcc/cpr_string.h because of undefined __BEGIN_DECLS. The files media/webrtc/signaling/src/sdp/sipcc/cpr_*_types.h defines __BEGIN_DECLS, however don't seem to be included in media/webrtc/signaling/src/sdp/sipcc/cpr_types.h because SIP_OS_* is not defined.

Proposed patch

The patch expands __BEGIN_DECLS and __END_DECLS in the 3 places where it is used and removes their definitions from cpr_*_types.h.

If the firefox build system does not export SIP_OS_*, the files cpr_*_types.h might actually be unused.

Let's keep the extern "C" stuff here. Otherwise ok.

Do you have try access? If not, I can do a try push once you have a new patch.
Thanks for reviewing.

The rationale for leaving out the extern "C" in crp_strings.h is that this header contains only #defines (and no function declarations,...), which are not subject to name mangling.

I don't have try access. Thanks for offering to do a try push for me!

   Ahh, I was looking at cpr_string.h and not cpr_strings.h in dxr. My mistake.

Mistakenly filed against Firefox 38 and should be instead 38 Branch. Sorry for the spam. dkl
