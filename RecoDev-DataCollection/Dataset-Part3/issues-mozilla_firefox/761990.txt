Can we test nightly updates with the Test Pilot add-on installed to try to find a regression window? Adding qawanted.
(In reply to Alex Keybl [:akeybl] from comment #1)
Using the stand-alone Add-on I get no Feedback Button at all (neither in the Customization Palette) using Nightly Builds.

Btw, the Button and Hover-Effect is okay in Icons + Text Mode and small Icons Mode.
I'll get some eyes on this.
I couldn't find the regression window on the Nightly branch because I couldn't get the 'Feedback' button (even with the Test Pilot add-on installed). 
Tried on the Aurora branch:

I can confirm that the overlap doesn't occur and the Hover-Effect is ok if the check-box 'Use Small Icons' is enabled in the Customize Toolbar dialog, regardless of the selected show type (Icons and text, Icons or Text).

The 'Feedback' button is not displayed properly only if the selected show type is 'Icons' and the check-box 'Use Small Icons' is disabled.
Issue is reproducible only on the Default Theme.
It's very weird to me that Bug 748475 is somehow implicated based upon comment 4. I'm including a couple folks who may be able to help investigate on the Firefox side, as well as on the add-on side.

I don't see why comment 4 would suggest that. There are many other bugs in that range that are more likely to cause this than that bug.

http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-aurora/rev/09750e764b6a may have had some unintended side effects, for example.

There are also a million gfx changes in that range, though most of those might be android-only.
My gut guess is that bug 734373 is the cause for this.

I've seen my Cheevos addon acting funky (point total not clickable) after this patch landed but I have just planned to change how my button works so as to continue to make the text clickable.

You're correct - the pushlog must have come up with only Bug 748475 for some reason. Sending over to Dao to investigate - I think a good first step would be to try to back out bug 734373 on a try build.
There are two ways to address this: The Feedback add-on could stop using the toolbarbutton-1 class if it wants to customize the button style, or we could hack around text being forcefully displayed in buttons with the toolbarbutton-1 class while in icons-only mode.

The attached patch does that.
This bug somehow missed me, but I am on it now.  I have a huge patch waiting to land, and I will get this figured out by tomorrow morning, and review what has happened so far.
I tried installing the Test Pilot add-on and am unable to get a feedback button on my toolbar in Nightly (the same as comment #2).

Dao, can you let me know how you tested this patch?
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/proxy-selector/ provides a similar toolbar button which you can use for testing.
I applied the patch and installed the proxy-selector add-on. When I added the Proxy Selector Button to the toolbar, all I see is the dropdown arrow:
http://screencast.com/t/zDqaVJXh
The add-on provides multiple buttons. Just add them all. If none has a label, try opening a new window. Over here one of the buttons gets a "System Proxy" label.

Review of attachment 635072:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I added both the button and the dropdown but still get no visible label with the Proxy Selector add-on. This is on a different machine that I tested with for comment #17, but the same results. I opened new windows and restarted the browser but none of those attempts had any affect.

I then used DOM Inspector and saw that there was no label attribute set for the #mproxy-element-button. I set a label attribute (xbl:inherits=value=label on the nested <label>) and the text appeared. There's probably a bug with the Proxy Selector add-on, but that's not what this bug (#761990) is about.

Nonetheless, with the inserted text, the button looks correct but is missing the hover state and pressed state. That doesn't appear to be a cause of this bug and could be something again specific to the Proxy Selector add-on.

TL;DR, this patch looks good and should hopefully fix the text layout for the Feedback button.

We need this now so that we get the Feedback button back, in preparation for landing bug 686335 on Aurora/Beta.

I know this one is closed, but if anyone in this thread wants to give a tutorial in how to fix problems like this (especially working from OSX), that would be amazing :).  I know that I have a very hard time tracking down bugs on windows side, with my available tools (a window vm, the binary builds of aurora).
Looks fine to me in Firefox 14.0b9, marking verified.

Not sure it's enough, but I use the DOM Inspector to poke around Firefox chrome to find and test fixes for UI bits. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dom-inspector-6622/ Also, I'm sure there's a better tool but I'm oldschool like that ;)

The 'Feedback' button still does not get highlighted when hovering the mouse over it
- this happens when the selected show type is 'Icons' and the check-box 'Use Small Icons' is disabled.

The hover effect is ok in all the others customized combinations between 'Use Small Icons' and Show types (Icons and text, Icons or Text).

Is there a bug on file for this yet? If not, can you file one for this Simona?

Verified on Windows 7 and Windows XP using Firefox 15 beta 2 that the "Feedback" button's dropdown arrow doesn't overlaps the label.
