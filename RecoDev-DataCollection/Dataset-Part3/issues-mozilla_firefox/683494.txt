Firefox UI-both.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

Please consider this an enhancement request. My apologies if this is the wrong place to file such.


Actual results:

Please see attachment - there is only a slight difference in appearance in the Forward and Back buttons, between the Enabled state and Disabled state. In prior versions of Firefox the distinction was very clear - the icon was colored in the Enabled state and grayscale in the Disabled state.


Expected results:

Especially when many tabs are opened (including some opened automatically by websites), it would be a convenience to discern more easily and quickly whether the Back button will do anything. Particularly for users such as I, who often do Alt+LeftArrow instead of using the mouse.
Thank you for considering this feedback.
