It looks like the navigation toolbar is a few pixels too wide in the customize mode, please see the highlighted area in the screenshot and compare with the light theme.

I think it's the border on #customization-container combined with the fact that we have no border on #nav-bar that's causing that effect - I see it on linux also.

We could either remove the border: none on nav-bar or add a border: none to the customization container.

I'm not actually sure if this is the right approach here.  We could alternatively make the border options for customize mode variables, although they do get pretty complicated (http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/themes/linux/browser.css#2196-2206).

Apologies for the delay; yes, I think this is neater than variable-ifying this.
