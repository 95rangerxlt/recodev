Patch v1.1

r=me, but we should figure out how to kill the stack entirely as a next step
Checked in with temporary background images. Note that this will make the bottom corner of the button slightly fuzzy until bug 24998 lands.

How come the mid-bottom and mid-top images were removed?  Weren't they supposed to create a separator between the star and go button? (Not that it worked before this checkin anyways)

No, they were horizontal elements that were repeated to allow the button to scale vertically while keeping the background intact.
