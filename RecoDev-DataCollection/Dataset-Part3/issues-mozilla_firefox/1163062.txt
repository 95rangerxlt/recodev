Per bug 1161260 comment 14, there's value in un-hardcoding these strings and making them localizable, even if they won't be used for release, because they might be used up to Beta. It's better to start localizing them now so that there's a one cycle of buffer to get them translated for beta.

make-e10s-strings-localizable

This moves all strings into localizable files and adds a localization note explaining they are only for pre-release.

The only thing that this doesn't translate are the "disabled reasons" that are hard-coded in nsAppRunner.cpp. It would involve some more code changes and I believe it's not worth doing that for something that's temporary.

r=me without the pref change.

There were more instances of "help testing multi-process", "enable multi-process", etc. This sounds weird to me but I'm not a native speaker so I'll bend to whatever additional opinion you can get about this :)

Maybe "Enable multi-process Firefox"? The current feels different than "Enable e10s", not sure.
I dropped the "E10S" name as Dcamp suggested in bug 1161260 comment 5 that it doesn't mean much to the regular user. So that's why there are more occurrences of "multi-process" now. I changed the string you suggested to "Enable multi-process &brandShortName;", it does look better.
