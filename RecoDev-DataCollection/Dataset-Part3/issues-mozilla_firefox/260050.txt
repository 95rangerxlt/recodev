The two paragraphs we have on tabbed browsing are not enough.
Have a look at this: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/tabbed-browsing.html

Maybe Blake can provide something from his guidebook as well?

a starting point

a starting point.
btw, a tabbed browser pref (in Advanced Options) is not documented in Help.
The undocumented pref is being documented in another Help bug to document the
fix for single-window mode, which is currently in review.  I don't remember the
bug#, but there aren't that many Help bugs.

a starting point

Thanks for writing this, Daniel! I'd say it's a pretty good starting point.

>    Tabbed Browsing lets you open tabs, each displaying a Web page, within a single
>    Firefox window. This frees up space on your desktop.
We're lowercasing "web page" and "web site" everywhere in Help.

>  Creating and Loading Tabs
>
>    To open a new tab, press Ctrl+T, or open the File menu and choose New Tab.
...or double-click in the Tab Bar.
...or click the Add Tab button, available from the <link>Customize Toolbar
dialog.

>  Closing Tabs
>
>    To close the current tab, you can press Ctrl+W, click the Close Tab button [x],
>    middle-click the tab, or open the File menu and choose Clost Tab.
s/Clost/Close/

>  More shortcuts
s/More/Keyboard/
>    While it's easy to select tabs with a mouse, you can also cycle through tabs
>    using the keyboard: use Ctrl+PgUp (or Ctrl+Tab) and Ctrl+PgDn (or Ctrl+Shift+Tab).
>    You can also select the first tab by pressing Ctrl+1, and so on up to the 9th tab
>    with Ctrl+9. If you have a middle mouse button, click it on a tab to close the tab.
Drop the last sentence, you've explained that already.

>  Bookmarks and Tabbed Browsing
>
>    To bookmark a set of tabs:
>    1. Press Ctrl+D, or open the Bookmarks menu and choose Bookmark This Page.
>    2. Check the 'Bookmark all tabs in a folder' checkbox to store all the tabs
>       in the current window into a Bookmark Folder.
>
>    To open bookmarks in tabs,
...middle-click a bookmark folder or right-click it...
>    and choose Open in Tabs.

>  Home Page as Tabs
>
>    Instead of just one web page as your homepage, you can make your home page
>    several pages. Select your favorite Web sites and open them in a set of tabbed
>    windows. Open the Tools menu and choose Options. Select 'General'. Under 'Home Page',
>    press the 'Use Current Pages' button. Now when you hit the Home button on the
>    Navigation toolbar, your favorite web sites will load with just one click.
I don't like "hit". And I hope we don't need to explain where the Home button
is.
How about this:
Now you can load your favorite web sites with just one click on the Home
button.

>Customizing Tabbed Browser
>
>    To customize Tabbed Brower, open the Tools menu and choose Options.
>    Choose Advanced. Options for Tabbed Browser can be found under Browsing.
That will be changed to "Tabbed Browsing" by bug 172962.


Jeff, do you have further comments?

Patch based on starting point

Patch is based on starting point and addresses nits brought up by Steffen (and
also nits I encountered as I converted it to XHTML).  The patch adds refs into
ToC and index as well.

Patch also references prefs.xhtml#tabbed_browsing, which doesn't exist.  This
is to make sure we finish up bug 258076, which is a *huge* absence from our
prefs documentation right now.
Great!! I'll review this after I've got some sleep.

You need to add tabbed_browsing.xhtml to
mozilla/browser/components/help/jar.mn!

Er, yeah, that's what happens when I work too late.  All fixed, branch and trunk.

Note that this document /almost/ serves as more of a placeholder than anything
else right now.  It needs some screenshots and a bit more substance before I'd
consider it anything near perfect, but there's no time, so we do what we can.
