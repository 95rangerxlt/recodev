:Ursula just ran into this while working on bug 1021654, and it's pretty mysterious.

By default, we preload the next newtab page in the background after the first newtab page has opened. This first preloaded tab works properly.

But once that newtab page is opened, the _next_ preloaded page doesn't seem to be able to send messages up to the parent.

Investigation will be ongoing in here.

The problem is that the RemoteWebNavigation is constructed lazily, and the preloaded browser is sending up its LocationChange message before the RemoteWebNavigation has a chance to be loaded and attached. So the reason that the messages aren't being received is because the RemoteWebNavigation is created too late.
Big correction to that last comment - RemoteWebNavigation is created on time, since that's what we use to tell the remote browser where to go. It's _RemoteWebProgress_ that's not created in time.

Bug 1181601 - Make sure RemoteWebProgress is instantiated for preloaded browsers. r?ttaubert

When remoting the about:newtab page, we noticed that the parent still thought that
the preloaded about:newtab browsers were all pointed at about:blank still. This
was because the preloaded browsers didn't have their RemoteWebProgress's
initialized in time to receive the location change messages from the child.
