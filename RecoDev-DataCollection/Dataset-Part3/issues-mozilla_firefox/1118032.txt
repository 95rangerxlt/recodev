I suggest slightly rearranged:
"Yes"
"Yes, except in high contrast themes" and
"No"

Thanks for filing. I think "Yes, except in high contrast themes" is still kind of long.

Maybe we could invert the text here and use:

"Override the colors specified by the page with my selections above:"

"Always"
"Only on High Contrast themes"
"Never"

Would that work as far as you are concerned, Jared & Philip?

s/on/in/, maybe? Not sure what the best way to say that is.

I'd say Only _with_

I needed to add flex=1 because otherwise the label of the high contrast option got ellipsis-ed...

I don't see why flex=1 was needed here, and having it here makes the menuitem get truncated with an ellipsis if the selected value is Always and the menupopup is opened.

Removing the flex=1 has the menupopup showing the full size necessary to fit the "Only with High Contrast themes" in all cases.

Please put these in ordering that they appear in the dialog (always, only, never). Conveniently, that is also alphabetical ordering of the entity names too :)

Errr, that's odd, because I saw exactly the opposite behaviour.

Yeah, which caused me to double and triple check what I was seeing. Can you try it again?

adjust UI describing color behaviour,

Updated as per IRC discussions so the dropdown stretches the width of the dialog, which means text doesn't get ellipsis'd anywhere, and with the l10n bits sorted.

LGTM, thanks! I wonder if there is a bug with OSX that is causing the dropdown arrow to not be given enough space so when the text is long enough it causes the ellipsis to appear. The menulist works perfectly fine on Windows without the align=start and no flex=1. The alternative may be to keep the align=start but wrap it in a #ifdef XP_WIN, at least until we can figure out why it doesn't work as intended on other platforms.
