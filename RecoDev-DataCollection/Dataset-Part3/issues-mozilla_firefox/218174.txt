When visiting the story pages on 'morons.org' using a recent nightly build,
Firebird crashes every time. I'm not sure how to determine exactly why it's
crashing, but it's reproducible (at least on my machine). When I was using 0.6,
I did not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://web.morons.org/
2. Click on one of the story pages.

Actual Results:  
Browser crashed.

Expected Results:  
Story page loaded and displayed.

I'm not sure how to get this information on Linux. If someone lets me know, I'll
be glad to do it. The only error message I get is on startup and says:
LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library
/usr/lib/adobesvg/adobesvg-3.0/libNPSVG3.so [libgtksuperwin.so: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory]
but there is on SVG on the offending page, so I don't think that's it.

Was any plug-in added?

Mike, this WFM on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.5b)

Would you please be so kind as to check with a fresh, vanilla profile? That's by
either calling MozillaFirebird with option "-ProfileManager" -> manage profiles
-> Create Profile or by renaming / moving your .profile directory of Mozilla
Firebird.
tried it with a blank profile and it does in fact work... any idea how to narrow
down what in my usual profile is causing the problem?
Well, in a new version of Firebird, the crash is no more. So I guess it is
fixed, though I still have no idea what triggered it in the first place.
