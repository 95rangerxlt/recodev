Need to replace non-standard expression closure with one of:
  * function declaration
  * function expression
  * arrow function
before fixing bug 1083458.

converting rules are following:
  * function declaration
    add `return` and braces
  * standalone named function expression
    add `return` and braces
  * standalone anonymous function expression contans and receives `this` (Array.filter, bind, etc)
    convert to arrow function, and remove code passing |this|
  * standalone anonymous function expression contans no `this`
    convert to arrow function
  * property with anonymous function expression, contains `this`
    add `return` and braces
  * property with anonymous function expression, contains no `this`, short body
    convert to arrow function
  * property with anonymous function expression, contains no `this`, long body
    add `return` and braces
  * property with named function expression
    add `return` and braces
  * getter property
    add `return` and braces
  * setter property
    add braces

Since there are a lot of patches, separated into 8 bugs, each bug corresponds to one of following directories:
  * browser/, except browser/components/.
  * browser/components/.
  * dom/.
  * layout/.
  * services/.
  * toolkit/, except toolkit/components/.
  * toolkit/components/.
  * b2g/, chrome/, docshell/, mobiles/, modules/, netwerk/, parser/, security/, storage/, testing/, webapprt/, widget/, xpcom/
(not yet touched addon-sdk)

I have draft patches, will post them (may take some time to prepare and post).

this.CustomizableUI is frozen, too, so I think it's fine to just make these properties, too.

This or:

let toHexString = charCode => ("0" + charCode.toString(16)).slice(-2);

::: browser/components/migration/IEProfileMigrator.js:358

here too, let yesNoToBoolean = v => v == "yes";

Seems like this is now duplicated? Not sure what went wrong here...

Just to be sure, you know `arguments` is also lexical right? See bug 889158 and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Lexical_arguments
