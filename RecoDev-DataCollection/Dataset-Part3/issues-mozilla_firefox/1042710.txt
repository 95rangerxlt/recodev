Thanks, Sam. This bug sounds like it might be related to bug 1041334.
Gizmodo has a 2013 article about this issue, concerning an Adblock "whitelist" that some users have worked around by installing Adblock Edge https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-edge/

It's a relatively small add-on that has a good star rating. I just installed it on Firefox 30.0 for openSUSE and do not see any text/banner ads in Gmail. I do still see "Related Google+ Page" when reading an e-mail where the ads on the side would usually be, but those aren't from an ad server.

Menu > Add-ons, and "Adblock Edge" search should show it at the top. Hope that helps.
Can you still reproduce it?
Similar AdBlock Plus problems were reported in (meta) bug 930787 comment 19. I added a comment recommeneding that we track this problem in this bug.
This seems to be fixed.
