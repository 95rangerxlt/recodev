STR:
Open multiple tabs
Open a tab to about:customizing
Click on a different tab to exit customization mode but keeping the customization mode tab open
Now click on the customization mode tab to reenter customization mode and then quickly click back on the non-customization mode tab.

The customization tab won't be selected anymore, but the tab contents will still be customization mode.

I think we have similar bugs on file which are higher priority, but this has better STR. Let's fix this here, but I'd also be in favour of upping the priority, because this kind of thing really shouldn't be happening.
