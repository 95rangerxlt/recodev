Hey Todd,

Any update on when this two addons will be working with Firefox 3.1?

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2098 update notifier  3.0.*
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1320 gmail manager  3.0.*

It would be great to have them ready for the last beta planned for next month.

haven't seen any 3.1 news on the forum for Update Notifier http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=384038&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=525
gmail manager made it to b2, update notifier is still stuck at 3.0.*
gmail will not launch with 3.5b4
gmail e-mail folder colour manager does not work on FF3.5 (no popup on mouseover), did on 3.0.11
above seems intermittant -- closed and reopened FF, the folder colour change worked. Btw, that was on click, not on mouseover.
Both of these extensions have been updated to support the Firefox 3.5 release.
