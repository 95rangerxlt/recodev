hmmm - OTOH though, we already call the server on signout, so we should be able to get these stats directly from the server. I guess that would fail to capture disconnections while not connected to the network, but I'm not sure that's a real issue, and the desktop philosophy is "don't collect what a server already knows". rfkelly, what do you think?

Is this the POST to /v1/session/destroy?  We do track that, but I'm not sure if we can distinguish between is being called via the disconnect button in sync, versus a signout for other reasons via web content.  Perhaps the distinction doesn't really matter anyway.

So yes, I think it would be reasonable to track this metric on the server.  You could consider sending e.g. a `service=sync` query param on the request to make it a little easier to distinguish.

Yeah, that sounds like a perfect compromise, thanks.

This adds ?service=sync to the URL when calling /session/destroy. It's not ideal as the code is in services/fxaccounts, but assumes the service in question is "sync" (IOW, logging in and out of FxAccounts may log you in and out of more than just Sync in the future) - but chatting with rfkelly in IRC we agreed that's fine for now.
