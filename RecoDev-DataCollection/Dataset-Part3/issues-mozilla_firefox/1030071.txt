Now that we have Talos tests for Session Restore startup, we can experiment on the influence of raw size on startup duration.

Now that we have Talos tests for Session Restore startup, we can experiment on the influence of raw size on startup duration.
For some reason, I can't seem to run Talos tests these days. Here are the results I got on Linux opt before I encountered the issue:

* Full Session Restore
- Base line (690kb) => 1482.56ms
- Base line + 2Mb of noise => 1466.67ms
- Base line + 2Mb of _closedWindows => 1503.56ms
- Base line + 2Mb of openWindows => 5158.22ms

* Session Restore without Auto-Restore
- Base line (690kb) =>
- Base line + 2Mb of noise => 661.67ms
- Base line + 2Mb of _closedWindows => 682.44ms
- Base line + 2Mb of openWindows => 692.56ms

Influence of size (if we don't auto-restore the session)

Influence of size (if we auto-restore the session)
To make a long story short:
- size does not matter;
- cookies don't matter;
- history doesn't matter;
- forms don't matter;
- closed windows don't matter;
- closed tabs don't matter.

What matters is:
- number of open windows (both with auto-restore and without);
- number of open tabs (only with auto-restore).
