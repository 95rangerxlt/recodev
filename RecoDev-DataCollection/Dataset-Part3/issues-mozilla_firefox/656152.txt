Currently, the string to restart in 32-bit mode for plugin compatibility is a bit overly aggressive. It implies that you *have* to restart.

Current text:
"This page requires a plugin that can only run in 32-bit mode"

Proposed new text:
"This page asks to use a plugin that can only run in 32-bit mode"

The difference is that you can very often view and interact with a page fine (see pages on microsoft.com that seem to insist on using Silverlight no matter whether the content actually uses it), but suggests something you can do in case there's something missing on the page.

Am I missing something? Who should review this?

Sadly yes. Whenever we change strings we also have to change the string's key to make sure that localizers spot that the text has changed and that they need to re-translate it.
