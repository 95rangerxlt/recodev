The non-standard SuggestionURL tag in search plugin's description has inconsistent capitalization compared to OpenSearch-defined Url tag.

While consistently using "URL" would be a better choice, the OpenSearch spec is not under our control, so we should use SuggestionUrl for consistency.

Checked in branch and trunk. Nickolay, can you post to the l10n newsgroup announcing this change, and update any devmo docs accordingly?
