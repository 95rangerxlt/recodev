You need to also indicate your transition plan away from NPAPI plugins. You can do that here as a public bug comment or by sending a private email to pluginwhitelist@mozilla.com
Transition Plan

We do have plans to move away from the plugin architecture with our iPrint Clients.  The new model would move us towards browser independence and also eliminate the need for plugins from each of the browsers where we instead interact with a web server/service on the workstation rather than using the browser/plugin to facilitate this effort.  We are beginning this research and evaluation for our next release and intention is that it would take us around 6 months to complete the release.  We would also need some time to move our current customers forward to the new solution as well so expect that we would need to continue the whitelist activity for the initial 6 months and possibly need the extension of time here as well to have our large customer base moved forward.
The application is accepted.

You should not rely on being whitelisted for more than 4 months. As an shorter-term solution, please consider making your solution available as a Firefox extension that users or enterprise administrators can install. NPAPI plugins can be bundled inside an extension and will activate automatically in that case, but it provides for better user opt-in and control.
We are not seeing this as whitelisted at this point.  Do we need to have a certain browser version or what other requirements are needed to see this?
Hi Ted, forwarding this need info to request to Benjamin who may be able to assist you.
