BMB_bookmarksPopup:child should match any bookmark opened under the bookmarks menu button.

Removing Australis:P1 whiteboard tag because these already block an Australis:P1 and being redundant isn't helpful.

So it turns out this was remarkably easy. One caveat is that sometimes mouseups are fired for the "arrow" of the panel when after clicking on the dropmarker.

It's possible Enn's patch in bug 941409 will fix this, but if not, we're going to have to address this somehow. Worst case scenario, we'll need to subtract menu button clicks from the BMB_bookmarksPopup click count.

I'll file a separate bug for that.

Sure, here goes:

1) In Nightly, open about:telemetry and ensure Telemetry is enabled. If not, enable and restart the browser.
2) Click on the right side of the Bookmarks menu button to bring up the list of bookmarks.
3) Click on a bookmark.
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 any number of times
5) Open about:telemetry, and expand the "Simple Measurements" section.
6) There should be a row labeled "UITelemetry". On the right half of that row is a big JSON blob. You're looking for and entry in that blob called "BMB_bookmarksPopup". The entry should be a key, mapped to an object that will hold the count of how many times a bookmark has been clicked from the popup with each mouse button.

So, for example, if you clicked on 15 bookmarks in the popup with the left mouse button, and right-clicked one of those bookmarks once, you'd see:

BMB_bookmarksPopup: {
  left: 15,
  right: 1
}

And that's it!

Let me know if you have more questions.
