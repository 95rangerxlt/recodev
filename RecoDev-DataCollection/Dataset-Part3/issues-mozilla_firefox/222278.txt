Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

Using Firebird 0.7 (downloaded 10/15/03), running under Mac OS X 10.2.8,
navigate to any page on the internet you wish to bookmark in the bookmark bar. 
After the page loads, attempt to drag the mini icon (or default globe icon) left
of URL in address bar to bookmark bar so as to make it a one-click bookmark
(like in Camino).  Instead of icon staying put (it does do an outline-drag),
Firebird issues system beep and refuses to install bookmark/icon in bookmark bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pick any URL/web page; navigate to it and let it fully load.
2.Drag icon/globe to bookmark bar.
3.Nothing happens and system beeps.

Actual Results:  
Firebird beeps error instead of installing bookmark in bookmark bar.

Expected Results:  
Make it a one-click bookmark (like in Camino).  Icon should stay put in bookmark
bar.

We don't have a bookmarks bar in Bugzilla.  Did you mean Firebird perhaps?
works for me:  20031013.  try deleting your profile?
WFM Linux Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7
Works fine for me, too.

Firebird/0.7+, OS X 10.2.8

Granted, my build was the latest nightly from the trunk, while yours looks like
a branch build, so maybe the difference is there.
I see the behavior described using the 0.7 official, but WFM using the latest
nightly. Resolving as Fixed.
