Collaboration is a wide term with lots of opportunity; let's do some research to inform our next steps and identify features and areas of interest.

Our literature review of previous research has generated an good catalog of possible use cases. We have determined both use cases and affective cases.

Moving on to investigating a prototype based on two aspects to support these use cases (in addition to the already existing video support): DOM-based, bidirectional co-browsing and instant message integration. The goal of the prototype is to qualitatively study user pairs with a set of activities that support some of the use/affective cases we have identified.
