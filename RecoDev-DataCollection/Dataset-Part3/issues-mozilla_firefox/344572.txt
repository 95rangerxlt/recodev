Steps to reproduce:

1. Run WindowEyes v5.5K
2. Run a trunk build of Firefox that has the newly reorganized prefs window
3. Tools / Options / Privacy
4. Tab to "Remember visited pages for the last [   ] days" and/or the edit box itself where you can enter the number of days

Results:

On the checkbox, WindowEyes speaks the literal text of the checkbox, "Remember visited pages for the last.  Checkbox.  Checked."  On the edit box, WindowEyes speaks the "9" but does not speak "days" (the unit of measure).

Expected behavior:

In Firefox 1.5, you could tab to the number of days editbox and WindowEyes would speak the entire label on both sides, plus the current value, i.e. "Remember visited pages for the last 9 days."

restore labelledby solution from firefox 1.5

Firefox 1.5 used a "DHTML Accessibility" labelledby trick to make the textbox by "labeled by" the containing box, which includes the unit of measure label.  So compliant ATs (such as WindowEyes) will speak the unit of measure along with the current value of the text box.
Mark you should land this on trunk immediately so we let it bake for a few days before landing on 1.8 branch.
