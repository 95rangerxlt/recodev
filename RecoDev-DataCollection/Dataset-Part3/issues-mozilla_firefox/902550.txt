Session restore is supposed to be completely disabled on mozilla-central when browser.tabs.remote is set. However, it looks like we can still call the onLoad function, which can cause problems. This patch adds another test to avoid this.

I think we should bail out earlier, before observers are added. Otherwise we'll end up tracking windows when they're opened etc.

This should skip the observers.

Tom noticed a couple paths through the API that need fixing.

What about all other public functions?
HistoryMenu calls: getClosedTabCount, getClosedTabData, getClosedWindowCount, getClosedWindowData

duplicateTabIn call duplicateTab

is it permanent disabled or just until Session restore will be e10s ready?
