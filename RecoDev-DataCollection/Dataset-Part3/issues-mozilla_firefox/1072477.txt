fix-shim-listener-removal

I found this bug while writing the tests in bug 1072467. When the EventTarget shim is running listeners, it just iterates over them. This can break if one of the listeners calls removeEventListener. Here's what happens:

listeners = [#1, #2]
start running listener #1 at index 0
listener #1 removes itself
listeners = [#2]
in the next loop iteration, we try to run index 1 but it doesn't exist, so we stop, missing listener #2

The obvious fix is to copy the list before running the listeners.
