The Kashubian localization team has retired from the project. We've been unable to find new contributors to take it over and ensure it remains up-to-date. We're ending Firefox builds for Kashubian as of Firefox 34 and removing Kashubian from mozilla.org and from public downloads.

This bug is for all-locales and shipped-locales.

This was not removed from the l10n dashboard and caused failure on Beta 1 submission - flagging here to get that fixed on the dashboard side before future betas.
I fixed this. Also, for future reference, I think I'm the only one that knows how to technically do it.
