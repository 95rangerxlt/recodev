Currently e10s is not allowed on Beta, making the browser.tabs.remote.autostart prefs no-ops:

Can we just change this line to check for release only?

Passing this off to felipe, he understand what impact this would have.
We actually don't want to change that line because that will enable all the e10s UI. We just need to change the conditions in nsAppRunner.cpp.

But there are no compile checks to differentiate between Beta and Release. We may just allow release users to toggle the pref, or check based on the channel. I'll take the bug.

So this basically removes the E10S_TESTING_ONLY parts of nsAppRunner.cpp.  The nsIObserver that was ifdef'ed is used in the Preferences dialog to display the possible reason e10s was disabled. It won't be used on Beta right now, but eventually I want to show that information in about:support, so that's why I'm leaving it there

e10s-a11ychecks

In order to allow e10s to be used on beta, we need to also enable the code that checks for a11y and disables it.

This code is all duplicated from the E10S_TESTING_UI block above in the same file. Instead of removing the parts that can be removed, I duplicated the parts that I want to keep for simplicity. Everything else not used will be removed in a separate bug for clarity: bug 1227230
Note: in order to run the e10s beta experiment (bug 1222894), we need to uplift these two patches to Beta

This looks good to me, but seems like an e10s peer should review this.

Thanks for pointing out bug 1227230. It'll be nice to close that one out. :)

Felipe, have we made a decision on whether to conduct an A/B experiment on e10s on Beta44? I know it was planned for Beta43 but did it really happen. I am just trying to confirm the plan because bug 1222894 mentions Beta43.
Ritu: yeah, the plan is to conduct a short A/B with a small population on Beta 43 (7.5%, which is bug 1222894), and then a larger one on Beta 44 (bug 1225496)

Please uplift to aurora and beta, needed for planned a/b test.
Felipe, are we doing a11y checks on nightly? I'm asking because this came up in the channel meeting this morning, as many of the top crashes on nightly are a11y-related.

Please uplift both patches on this bug for e10s a/b testing to aurora and beta.

Yeah, there are checks, but on Windows there's a blacklist of a11y clients known to be problematic, and if it doesn't match that blacklist (like remote desktop), e10s is still enabled together with a11y

nit - you don't need this one, you're in the a11y notification observer.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: follow-up here with the question raised in comment 16.
[User impact if declined]: The a11y check for e10s would skip some known software that activates a11y but are not really a11y related. For the beta experiment we should really not skip them to avoid related crashes
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: landed on central
[Risks and why]: Given the changes here we'll need to QA the beta experiment well to ensure everything is working as expected (i.e., e10s can be enabled on beta and can be disabled by a11y tools)
[String/UUID change made/needed]: none

This change has no impact when e10s is disabled (which is how 43 and 44 will ship) but is required for a Telemetry experiment.

Vladan will land this himself after QA has finished verifying that this fix is sufficient for the experiment.

Aurora+ Beta+
needinfo for myself to land this after Kamil's testing
