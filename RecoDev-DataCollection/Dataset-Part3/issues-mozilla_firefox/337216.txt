change breaks on cygwin - nsinstall does not like a directory as an arg

a version that will work on windows

I'm testing this now on win32, and will test on mac/win with a mozconfig that does not define an objdir.  if that works, I'll request review.

the libs:: target did not work because windws does not support nsinstall of directories

Since shell.js and test.js do not write anything to the current dir, I cd to the source dir before running the tests.  but DIST is relative to the objdir, so I had to add PWD to the path to run-mozilla.sh and xpcshell (and PWD is the dir before the cd)

abspath did not work, so I used realpath

realpath did not work if I used it on both run-mozilla.sh and xpcshell, so I only used it on the first one

patch works on windows, mac, linux

is there a better way to wrap the xpcshell invocation?

ABS_DEPTH := $(shell cd $(DEPTH) && pwd) will make your life a lot simpler.
Instead of making the wrappers aware of cwd, I've changed the test harness code for this component to pass the directory containing the tests to the test runner (shell.js).  I've tested on mac (intel), and will test on win/linux shortly.

patch that special-cases windows due to path problems

on non-windows, shell.js parses the test data directory from the xpcshell command line

on windows, cd to the test data directory before running xpcshell (and use ABS_DEPTH as suggested by :bs to invoke xpcshell)

+load(topDir.path+'/test.js');

r=sayrer, assuming that line works on Windows.
