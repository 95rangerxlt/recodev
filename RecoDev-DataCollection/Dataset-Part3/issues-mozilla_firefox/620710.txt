Build Identifier: 4.0 beta 8

I am using Snow Leopard (10.6.5).  We have reported a problem using Jmol in later versions of 3. That report #581717 has been resolved in this release.   However the following has arisen.

The URL listed above is a menu page in which a number of items using Jmol are shown.   The top ones now work fine (no exception thrown).  The bottom ones (cyclohexanes) no longer throw the exception but now Firefox freezes.  In particular, the Apple menu bar now list AppleJavaHost as the application and nothing happens from there.   The page is frozen and you must quit AppleJavaHost before you can, and must, quit Firefox.

Note that these menu items attempt to load 2 applets whereas the earlier ones only load one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL above
2. Select menu items8, 9, or 10
3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes with the AppleJavaHost becoming the front application.

Expected Results:  
The applets would load and the buttons should work.

I have tested this out on a couple of other sites with the following results

The java console shows no error.  In fact it shows nothing.   However, the Mac Console shows the following error sequence.

This issue seems to have been resolved with Apple's release of the Java update last week, and using Firefox RC1.
