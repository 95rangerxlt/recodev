components/FlashStreamConverter.js is moved to content/ShumwayStreamConverter.jsm

XPCOMUtils.generateNSGetFactory lines removed from the ShumwayStreamConverter.jsm

Factories are created using XPCOMUtils._getFactory(targetConstructor).

You should use hg mv for this, rather than remove/add. It will make the diff much easier to read.

I used, git mv. However after sync'ing the built sources, I think hg will not be possible. (I was also hoping land it as combined patch during next shumway-mozcentral synchronization)

(actually, hg mv before sync'ing with built sources helped)
