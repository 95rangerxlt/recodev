Overriding the stock DOM properties doesn't seem sane to me.
How about adding previousVisibleTab, nextVisibleTab, firstVisibleTab, lastVisibleTab? Could be without "Visible" even.

some themes use these attributes.
Created attachment 627818
Implement various properties for easier visible tab access to CSS and JS.

Adds previousTab/nextTab to tabs.  Adds firstTab and lastTab to tabbrowser, and sets them as attributes.

It also adds the following, which Australis tabs need available:

1. Adds before/after selected/hovered tab properties and sets them as attributes.
2. Lets the in-tab-strip new tab button receive the after* properties and attributes.
3. Adds property/attribute "beforeNewTabButton" for the last visible tab.  Needed because the last tab needs to have an end separator in Australis iff the new tab button is in the tab strip after it.

The implementation for each property added to tabbrowser is a private field storing the tab reference, with a property getter/setter to remove the old tab's attribute, add the new tab's attribute, and update the field's value.

This is using mouseenter/mouseleave for the hovered parts.  A warning (from nsEventListenerManager.cpp:291) points out that those are slower than mouseover/mouseout, so alternatives are welcome.

Add id for new tab button, clean up a bit more.

This will get the new tab button by its id, instead of through DOM walking, which should be a bit cleaner/less error prone.

Also cleaned up |markTabs| a bit to make sure that unused properties get properly cleared.
I applied the patch and noticed that I can often get the last tab to have the |selected| attribute as well as the |afterselected| attribute.

If the tab is the first one after a single apptab, then the first tab can sometimes have |selected| as well as |beforeselected|.

We don't need these. I know how to implement the Australis theming without this.
Also, even though we don't need it, it's already possible to determine via pure CSS whether the in-tab-strip new tab button is immediately after the selected/:hover tab.

The following should be sufficient:
first-tab
last-tab
beforeselected
afterselected
beforehover
afterhover

Remove beforeNewTabButton, don't set attributes on new tab button.

Thanks Jared and Frank.  This addresses the deficiencies in the previous patch.

This changes when |markTabs| gets called in |addTab| as tabs could be moved around up to very late in that.

Calls |markTabs| via |updateCurrentBrowser|, to always re-mark when selectedTab changes.

It updates the setters for beforeselected/afterselected to remove beforehovered/afterhovered (so when a hovered tab gets selected, the hovered attributes get removed from its neighbors).

Also updates beforehovered/afterhovered setters to explicitly avoid setting to them on the selected tab.

Adds a few more tests for after pinning a tab.

Improvements based on feedback

Thanks, Dão.

The tests now call |_markTabs| directly after calls to |showTab| and |hideTab|, as those don't trigger it.  The non-test consumers of those do trigger |_markTabs|.

To avoid conflicts with the attributes from tabbox, these are the new attributes:

first-visible-tab
last-visible-tab
beforeselected-visible
afterselected-visible
Sending the patch to the tryserver to see if it causes any test failures.
ok I've tried the patch on UX, what about the pinned tabs??? First, pin more than 3 tabs, then make the tab-bar over-flowed. Select an unpinned tab, hover those pinned tab and you'll see the tabs are 1px overlap the nav-bar. Next select the 1st pinned tab, then hover the 2nd and the 3rd pinned tabs, you'll see the unselected tabs background overlapping the selected tabs background. I hope this will be fixed in the next patch.
I manually pushed this to try server. Can you check to make sure that all tests are passing?

Actually, the look and feel is ok, I thinks the problem belongs to 'afterhover tab attributes' for pinned tab when tab-bar is over-flowed. Have you tried to reproduce the problem yet???

Don't mark selection-related attributes if the selected tab is not in the visibleTabs.

The test failures were due to the case where the selectedTab mightn't be a member of the visibleTabs.  This version will skip setting those attributes in that case and remove the attributes from any tabs with them.

I wasn't able to recreate the failures for browser_bug406216.js here.

I tried to recreate the pinned tab problem, but the nightly I downloaded (Linux) didn't yet have the Australis tabs.  I did notice that in the described case the pinned tabs get extra negative margin (via style "-moz-margin-start").  That happens from tabbrowser.xml:~3140, |_positionPinnedTabs|.

I looked at the hover attributes on the pinned tabs in that case, and they seemed to be set correctly.

This was occurring during the test for bug 455852 on the try builds.  That tests closing the only tab when browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab is false.

|_markTabs| gets triggered by adding a new tab to replace the only, closing tab.  But that tab is already marked |closing| (excluding it from |visibleTabs|), yet still the |selectedTab|.  This is a brief state, as the new tab gets selected and the tabs get remarked once the old tab is done being removed.

If the only case in which selectedIndex is -1 is when the only tab is being closed (as you described in the above comment), then visibleTabs.length would be 0, which we already check for above, so we shouldn't have to check for `selectedIndex == -1` below and the `selectedIndex < 1` should be `selectedIndex == 0`.

Address feedback, improve code documentation.

Thanks, Frank!

Couple of explanations:

> If the only case in which selectedIndex is -1 is when the only tab is being closed (as you described in the above comment), then visibleTabs.length would be 0, which we already check for above, so we shouldn't have to check for `selectedIndex == -1` below and the `selectedIndex < 1` should be `selectedIndex == 0`.

I didn't explain this well.  When the tab is closing, the new tab will be alone in |visibleTabs|, so the length is still 1.

Here's the relevant portion of |_beginRemoveTab|:

> 1 aTab.closing = true;
> 2 this._removingTabs.push(aTab);
> 3 this._visibleTabs = null; // invalidate cache
> 4 if (newTab)
> 5   this.addTab(BROWSER_NEW_TAB_URL, {skipAnimation: true});

So line five adds the new tab and then calls |_markTabs|, meaning |visibleTabs.length == 1| but it's not the |selectedTab| (excluded by |selectedTab.closing|).

I've updated the tests to use |this.selectedItem.closing| instead of checking if the index is -1.  I've also added a comment to the code that mentions the pref and the situation the test guards against.


> > +        let tab = event.originalTarget;
> 
> Since we're using mouseenter/mouseleave, according to Dão, this should be event.target and likewise for mouseleave.

I should have explained this.  Without the tests for |originalTarget.localName != "tab"|, we would handle retargeted mouseenter/mouseleave events from anonymous content.  

[ tab [xul:image] [xul:label][xul:toolbarbutton] ]
 ^gap1           ^gap2                          ^gap3

If the mouse on the |xul:image| moved right, into gap2 (margin of the |xul:image|), the tab would receive a retargeted mouseleave from the |xul:image| element.  That would remove the hover attributes.  We run into the same problem when hitting the other two gaps.

When we get a retargeted event, the |event.target| is always the tab, but the |event.originalTarget| is whatever element it came from.

For both of the handlers here, I've added comments to explain.
(In reply to Adam [:hobophobe] from comment #23)

So the closing property of the sole tab is false when _markTabs is called?
visibleTabs excludes tabs with the closing property set to true:

Really? Interesting. I thought that mouseenter and mouseleave don't bubble. The documentation says so:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOM_event_reference/mouseenter
Does anonymous content not follow this?

> visibleTabs excludes tabs with the closing property set to true:

At the time of the |_markTab| call, we have (name property for clarity):
tabs: [{name: "oldtab", closing: true, selected: true}, {name: "newtab"}]

The result of rebuilding |visibleTabs| is:
visibleTabs: [{name: "newtab"}]

The documentation on Anonymous Content explains a bit:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XBL/XBL_1.0_Reference/Anonymous_Content#Event_Flow_and_Targeting

The gist is that bubbling is different from retargeting.  When anonymous content is within an element's scope, and only for certain event types (UI events), the events get retargeted to the bound element.

This allows you to write a handler that would take specific actions for anonymous content without having to use JavaScript to directly attach handlers to those elements.  Not sure if it has other reasons/uses.

Example of that use:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/widgets/spinbuttons.xml#53
Dão, I'm relying on these attributes in bug 738491 in order to implement separators because I can't use the adjacent sibling selector due to how panorama is implemented and because the newtab-button is anonymous content.  Could you take a look at this patch?

Umm, I thought there would be existing mouseenter/mouseleave event handlers where you could hook into. But since this isn't the case, putting onmouseenter and onmouseleave directly on the button is more efficient. Use document.getBindingParent(this) instead of gBrowser.mTabContainer there.

>+      <handler event="mouseenter"><![CDATA[
>+        let tab = event.originalTarget;
>+        // Check originalTarget type to avoid handling retargeted events
>+        if (tab.selected || tab.localName != "tab")
>+          return;

<handler event="mouseenter" phase="target"><![CDATA[

>+      <handler event="mouseleave"><![CDATA[
>+        // Check originalTarget type to avoid handling retargeted events
>+        if (event.originalTarget.localName != "tab")
>+          return;

The patch in bug 738491 doesn't make use of the beforeselected-visible attribute.

Remove beforeselected-visible, use phase attribute on handlers for cleaner code.

Thanks, Dão!
Dão, do you think you'll get to this soon? It would be nice to get this landed on m-c so we don't have to keep maintaining the patch on this bug and in the UX branch for Australis.
Yes, I intend to get back to this very soon. I haven't forgot about it, it just got pushed back by other stuff.

Remove |if (beforeSelectedTab.hasAttribute("beforehovered"))| and just remove the attribute unconditionally.

>+            if (this._afterSelectedTab.hasAttribute("afterhovered"))
>+              this._afterSelectedTab.removeAttribute("afterhovered");

Test messages should describe the expected behavior, e.g. "First tab should have the first-visible-tab attribute", such that they make sense when the test passes as well as when it fails. Please adjust the messages in this test accordingly.

>+  gBrowser.hideTab(gBrowser.tabs[1]);
>+  gBrowser.mTabContainer._setPositionalAttributes();

You should never have to call _setPositionalAttributes in this test.
