When using TracingMetadata TRACING_TIMESTAMP for a marker with a single value (as opposed to a start/end time with TRACING_INTERVAL_START and TRACING_INTERVAL_END), the markers do not collect a stack.

Currently only affects console.timeStamp(), but ran into this when prototyping more marker code.

I think it would be fine to change the TimelineMarker constructor to do this.
Alternatively, subclasses can always call CaptureStack in their constructors.

Review of attachment 8614270:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

What is here looks good, however:

* I don't think I can actually review this.  You probably want smaug; he's reviewed all my patches in this area.

* The code in class TimestampTimelineMarker (Console.cpp) is curious with this change in place.  It captures the stack again (probably should be removed) and also applies it again to "mEndStack".  Perhaps this latter bit should be removed as well now, as it seems redundant.

Thanks, Tom -- removed the stack info in TimestampTimelineMarker, as that would've never triggered anyway.

I guess there are many ways

Removing the console.cpp stuff broke this; adding the TRACING_TIMESTAMP check to the other constructor of TimelineMarker fixes this:
