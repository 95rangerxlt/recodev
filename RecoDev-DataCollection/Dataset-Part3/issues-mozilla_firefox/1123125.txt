I have some Javascript experience, but am new to open source contributions. This bug sounds easy enough to fix. I would need some help on how to find this file in my local directory, and submitting the fixed version. Would you be able to show me the process? If yes, I can do my best on this.
Hi,
i already build the Mozilla code.
I want to work on this bug,
but i just want know how do i include the resource.js to new.js for using hasChild

Hi John,
You can start with developer guide (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide)
and also there are some tutorials on codefirefox (http://codefirefox.com)

Hi Vikram,
Actually you don't need to include it.
check projecteditor.js file lines 12 and 29 (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/6446c26b45f9/browser/devtools/projecteditor/lib/projecteditor.js)
so i just have to remove the hasChild from new.js right?
(In reply to Vikram Jadhav from comment #4)
> so i just have to remove the hasChild from new.js right?

Right and you need to change the calling of hasChild this.hasChild(parent, name) to be called from resoures
Are there any tests for this file?
Thanks

Sure there is test in this file(browser/devtools/projecteditor/test/browser_projecteditor_new_file.js)
I think I've completed the task. How can I check to see if it is correct and did not break anything?

bug1123125_removehasChild.diff

in resource.js, i've exported the hasChild function and used a require in the new.js file so the hasChild() function can be called with the existing definition in resource.js. The duplicate hasChild() definition in new.js was deleted.

parent.hasChild(name)

We don't need to export this.

Instead we should change the |hasChild| method to act on the current resource instance.  This is something I seem to have missed when reviewing bug 1103346.

So, remove the |resource| argument of |hasChild| and replace its usage with |this|.

You'll also need to update the calls in projecteditor/lib/plugins/rename/rename.js.
If I change the definition hasChild:function(resource,name) to hasChild:function(name), which variables in the function need to add a this. prefixed to them? Sorry, my Javascript is not too good.

Replace the parts of |hasChild| function body that used to say |resource| with |this|.  The current object *is* the parent resource, so we don't need to pass it in as an argument.

It seems Abdelrhman has given many comments, so I'll await your next revision. :)

Also, when attaching a new version, please mark the old attachments as "obsolete".

Don't worry about it, our processes are quite crazy, so it's a lot to take in at first! :) I'll take a look soon.

Great, looks good to me!

I've pushed this to our try environment to run tests.  Assuming it looks good, we can mark this bug "checkin-needed".

Feel free to look around for other bugs you'd like to work on.  Thanks again!

Try: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=5c9bd75e4f7a
Uh oh, looks like I broke Firefox. There are failed test cases. How do we fix these so we can update for checkin-needed?

At the moment, I believe these are not related to your patch and are just artifacts of our testing environment.  I've triggered that bad tests to re-run, so we'll see what happens.
Alright, hopefully all goes well! While we are waiting, how would I get my contributions on my github? I've watched the video on http://codefirefox.com/video/marketing-yourself, and I've forked the repository already. He says that any push that I do will show up, but I've only submitted the patches for review through bugzilla comments. How would github know?

If this is too much to explain, then just let me know. I can always do without it and just link a search with my name and completed bugs(when I have many contributions).

Once the tests look good, we'll set "checkin-needed".  A sheriff will land the patch to the fx-team repo[1].  Assuming it doesn't blow up there, it will be merged ~1 day later into mozilla-central[2] and this bug will be marked FIXED.  gecko-dev[3] on GitHub is a mirror of these repos, so it will show up there once the patch has landed.

Did the retests clear? It still shows the red test cases but I think that was the previous iteration. Are we clear for checkin-needed status?

Yes, everything looks good now!
Ahhh yeahhhh! We did it! Thanks for all the help. Until the next time we cross paths! I'm relearning Javascript and which ever other frameworks are used for Firefox, so I wont overwork you mentors for next time!
