Most use of non-standard SpiderMonkey extensions (legacy generator, for each, legacy array comprehension, etc) related to |SocialServiceInternal.manifests| have to be removed at once for simplicity.

I'll post a patch shortly.

We could use Object.values once it's implemented (bug 1208464), but not now.
for now, changed it to Object.keys + map.

...

This is a getter with legacy generator, that cannot be expressed in standard way.
I separated it into getter and ES6 generator method (SocialServiceInternal.manifestsGenerator), and now |manifests| getter calls manifestsGenerator and returns Generator object.

|[f(x) for each (x in array)]| can be rewritten as
|array.map(x => f(x))|

> -    let providerHasFeatures = [url for (url of featureURLs) if (data[url])].length > 0;
> +    let providerHasFeatures = featureURLs.some(url => data[url]);

|[x for each (x in array) if (g(x)]| can be rewritten as
|array.filter(x => g(x))|
also, |array.filter(x => g(x)).length > 0| can be rewritten as
|array.some(x => g(x))| if g(x) has no side effect

> -    aCallback([new AddonWrapper(a) for each (a in SocialServiceInternal.manifests)]);
> +    aCallback([...SocialServiceInternal.manifests].map(a => new AddonWrapper(a)));

|[f(x) for each (x in iterable)]| can be rewritten as
|[...iterable].map(x => f(x))|

looks ok.  I've never cared for spread syntax, every time I see it I have a WTF moment.
