Live Bookmark gets all posts not including the latest post. Refresh Live
Bookmark has no effect. Mozilla can pull up the original RSS feed itself (i.e.
by entering the URL in the address bar) and display the latest post along with
the others, but won't pull up the latest post within the Live Bookmark.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Added the specified URL as a Live Bookmark.
2. Checked it.
3. Checked it several hours later, no change.
4. Checked the original RSS feed and found that it had new content.
5. Tried going to Manage Bookmarks, right-clicking on the feed, and selecting
Refresh Live Bookmark.
6. Checked the live bookmark again, no change.
Actual Results:  
Live Bookmark still doesn't update to reflect the addition of the most recent post.

Expected Results:  
Live Bookmark should reflect the data from the RSS file, including the latest post.

Current contents of the feed

This is what the feed looks like right now.  The first entry doesn't show up.
Note that this entry doesn't have a title.
Which would make this a (pretty good) enhancement request, to synthesize a title
from the first n words/chars of HTML-stripped description, I'd guess.

I've gone the easy route and just used the pubDate -- I think that ensures us
getting something useful.  If there is no pubDate and no title, well.. then
tough.	I can probably synthesize an "Entry" title or something, if there's a
link.

I can't find out what (if any) RDF resource is used for the publication date in
RSS/1.0, though.

This patch depends on the patch for bug 253911 being applied before it.

http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date - 20040926T16:20:20-08:00 (not too pretty
for display).
