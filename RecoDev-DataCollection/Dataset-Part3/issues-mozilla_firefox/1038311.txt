Clicking on the lighter colored part of the shape does not work. Normally a shape like this is composed of two disjoint paths. In this case, I *think* the IDE generates two overlapping paths because of the way the SWF was authored. The hit testing algorithm probably thinks the point is outside, since it is inside of two paths.
I think we just have to return earlier whenever we start a new sub-shape (which happens when the fill/line style changes) and the hit-test is already positive at that point.
