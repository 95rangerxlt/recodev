We have one, will DM it to you. He's working with us on other AVG bugs, so if we have multiple bugs, it'd be great to get them all front and centre.
This bug will block all AVG issues, so that's one way.  If you see one that's missing, please add it.
Also, if the contact info is sensitive, can you just add it here and flag it sensitive?  I'd really like to keep track of this stuff in bugzilla or we'll be constantly searching for it.

Resolving. Kev, were we going to put these on the Intranet and link to there from here?
Yup. Will send email shortly. (didn't post, no donut.)
