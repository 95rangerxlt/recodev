You should have known it wouldn't be this easy ;).  There was a push literally 2 hours ago to fx-team that moved this file.  See Bug 1096575 - the new location is toolkit/devtools/server/actors/highlighter.css.

Let's see now then! :)
The patch looks good, but since the infobar font-size has been made smaller. It makes sense to me to make the arrow size smaller as well.
