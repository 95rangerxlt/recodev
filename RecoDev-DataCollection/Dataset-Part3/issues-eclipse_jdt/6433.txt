package p;
class A{
	int i(){
		if (false){
			//
		}
		i();
		int i= 0;
		return i;
	}
}
the ast says that declaration of the i temp includes 
the comment and the closing bracket from the if statement before!
plus the message send i();

This bug is a side-effect of the bug in checkAnnotation() of the parser class. I 
guess I can fix it if I consider that a local variable is never concerned by 
javadoc comments preceeding the declaration.
In your test case if you remove the comment, you will get the right positions.

Fix released in HEAD. Change in the Parse::checkAnnotation()
