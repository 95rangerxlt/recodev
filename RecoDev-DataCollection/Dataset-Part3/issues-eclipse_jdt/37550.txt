I would be neat while editing files, to have visual clues on the right hand 
side to indicate where changes have been made to the current file w.r.t. the 
repository. It should be possible to click on them to jump to the change.

This way I can more easily navigate the stuff I'm working on.

Perhaps a keyboard shortcut as well "goto next modification in file".
