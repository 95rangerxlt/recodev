Eclipse 3.0 M3 
I open a java source file, then press the insert key twice.
From then on, the format at you type settings (especially the automnated
indentation, that we have set to three spaces per tab) does not work anymore.
For instance, if I type return at the end of a line, the cursor will not be
positionned at the right indentation. If I type an opening curly brace, then
return, the right curly brace will not be aligned.
If I close the buffer, and reopen it, then everything is fine, as long as I do
not go in insert mode.

Moving to JDT/Text for comment
There are two modes: Insert and Smart Insert. If you set the mode to Insert then
there will be no smartness at all.


Daniel,
I tended to disagree with you, BUT you were right.
By the way are you Swiss or French?

The insert key behaves as a three position rotating switch :
default mode : smart insert mode
press insert : overwrite mode "Overwrite"
press insert again : dumb insert mode "Insert"
press insert again : back to smart insert mode "Smart Insert"
At the same time the status bar is being updated with the mode we are in.
By the way, it looks like it is the only editor where you have this behavior.

However, it would be nice to have a 3 lines explanantions of this behavior in
the help file, since this is not a standard behavior for a text editor, and can
be confusing even for experienced developers, and newbies to Eclipse.

I am contributing to Eclipse, as Public Domain, the following text to be
inserted in the Tips & Tricks Help for the JDT, to be potentailly placed just
after "Toggle between inserting and replacing code assist" in that help page:

============================================================================
Typing modes : Smart Insert, Insert and Overwrite modes behaviour and mode switching
============================================================================

When editing Java source code, the current buffer editor can be in one of three
typing modes : Smart Insert mode , Insert mode, or Overwrite mode.
 
The active mode of the current editor is displayed in the Workbench status bar.
Smart Insert mode is on by default, when you start Eclipse or when you open a
Java source file. 

You can switch between the three Typing modes by pressing the Insert key once,
or by double-clicking on the Typing mode in the Status Bar. 

In Smart Insert Typing mode, all the behaviour defined in Window > Preferences >
Java > Editor > Typing is active.

In Overwrite Typing mode, the text you type will overwrite the text located
after the cursor and in Insert Typing mode, the text you type will be inserted.

Additionally, when in Overwrite Typing mode, and Insert Typing mode, the Smart
Typing behavior defined in Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Typing is
unavailable (no more smart cursor positioning,...) 

Finally, Code Assist is always active, and not affected by the Typing mode. 
The Code Assist default behaviour (overwrite or insert) will behave as defined
in Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Code Assist. 
You can temporarily toggle this behaviour while inside the content assist
selection dialog by pressing the Ctrl key while selecting the completion,
regardless of the active Typing mode. 
============================================================================


>By the way are you Swiss or French?
Swiss (German part).

>By the way, it looks like it is the only editor where you have this behavior.
The text editor has "Overwrite" and "Insert" since we currently don't offer
smart typing for the normal text editor. There might be other editors built with
Eclipse that use the Smart Mode. Also note that you can toggle the modes by
double-clicking on the status field.

FYI: The easiest way to contribute (attach) would be to send a patch for the
given file(s). If this is to much work (e.g. if you don't work with
dev.eclipse.org CVS repository) then the modified file should be attached.

Hi I am a bit confused with this bug. In 3.0M6 , the behavior has changed, since
you can only go from Insert to Smart Insert, but the overwrite mode seem to have
disappeared.
Not true. You probably locked it (see Window > Preferences > Java > Editor,
Typing page
[ ] Disable overwrite typing mode in Java editors
Removing target milestone, no further action for 3.0.
Since the feature has changed in 3.1, this is no longer a pb and this bug should
be closed IMHO.
Thanks. We indeed fixed this for 3.1.
