We'll deal with this after WTP 0.7, either in 1.0 or in a 0.7 maintenance 
stream as needed.
We use the method org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaUI.createTypeDialog to display this 
the class browser.  Since, this is an Eclipse 3.1 JDT method I'm routing this 
defect over to the JDT team.  
The string is correctly externalized. Its key is TypeSelectionComponent_label in
property file:

org.eclipse.jdt.ui/ui/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/JavaUIMessages.properties

Steve, can you  please forward this bug report to the Russian translators. I
suspect that the entry is missing in the translated file.
Matt or Kit, please handle comment 4.

As suggested by Steve, I will assign this PR to camle@us.ibm.com.

Can you please talk to the corresponding translation team. 
TCT 346 has closed status. Please close this bug. 
Closing as invalid.
