public class Test
{
   public Test()
   {
      Math.abs(2);
   }
}
place the cursor just after the a in the abs function above and bring up the 
auto complete pop up (Ctrl+Space). pressing Ctrl highlights what is going to be 
deleted. If however the cursor was placed at the start of the abs function call 
that highlighting will not occur.
