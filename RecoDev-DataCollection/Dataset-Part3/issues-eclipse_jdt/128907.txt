The generated javadoc in the JDT ISV guide still says "Eclipse JDT Release 3.1".  This needs updating to 3.2.  The copyright year also needs updating.  These are updated in jdtOptions.txt and jdtOptions:

-header "<b>Eclipse JDT</b><br>Release 3.2"
-bottom "Copyright (c) IBM Corp. and others 2000, 2006.  All Rights Reserved."
