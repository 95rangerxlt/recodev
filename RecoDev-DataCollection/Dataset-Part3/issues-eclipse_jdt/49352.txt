write this:
	System.out.println(filter:)
Now let's fix this:
- enter a '"' between the ':' and the ')'
	System.out.println(filter:"")
To correct this try to enter a '"' between '(' and 'f'
	System.out.println(filter:"""")

In the described scenario the smartes solution would be to quote the word on the
left instead of adding ""

we shouldn't quote the word to the left, since a colon can also be part of a
ternary expression: 

method(condition ? null : "string");

However, the behaviour described in comment 0 is a bug: we need to exit linked
mode if the trigger character is typed outside the linked position.
fixed so that typing the exit character (quote in this case) outside the
original range exits the linked mode.
