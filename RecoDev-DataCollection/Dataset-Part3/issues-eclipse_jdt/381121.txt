JSR 335 draft spec lists out the following productions for
method references:


MethodReference:
 ExpressionName '::' NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier
 Primary '::' NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier
 ReferenceType '::' NonWildTypeArgumentsopt Identifier


It also lists out "int [] :: clone" as an example of method references.

This example cannot be reduced to any of the rules above: There are two
questions here, whether array types are allowed and whether primitive
array types are allowed if the former is.

We need to ask the spec master react suitably.

> We need to ask the spec master react suitably.

We have clarification that we should use the definition of ReferenceType
from JLS 4.3 and not from chapter 18. The former does allow [] syntax.
I'll augment the grammar after the grammar changes for bug 287648 are
complete.
