BETA_JAVA8:

There is some set up issue in TypeBindingTests308.java - when run by itself
the tests testAnnotatedBinaryType* pass. When run as part of RunAllJava8Tests
they fail. I fixed one issue to with picking up wrong JCL libraries, but that
does not seem to be all there is to it. Now the tests are failing with
"Outer cannot be found" which tells me that the library got added to the wrong
project - i.e the working copy from which an AST is built is from a different
project than the one to which the library was addeded.

Jay, please take a look - I have presently disabled 6 tests. They all
pass when run under TypeBindingTests308.java
This piece of code looks wrong to me:

 (AbstractCompilerTest.getPossibleComplianceLevels() & AbstractCompilerTest.F_1_8) == 0)

Shouldn't it be != 0 ?
Tests seem to pass with that change in. Will run all tests once before releasing.
