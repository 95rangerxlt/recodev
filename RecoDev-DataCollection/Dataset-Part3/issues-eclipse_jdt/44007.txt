From bug 44002:

In Problems View:

"Superfluous" is a word not commonly used in English.  Can the problem 
description be changed to "Extra semicolon"?

Philippe, can you move the PR back to JDT/UI when fixed so that we can update 
the compiler perference page as well.

Superfluous is perfectly fine according to the Oxford Advanced Learner's
dictionary. We could replace it with "Unnecessary" if this is clearer.
Philippe, did you change the error message produced by the compiler. If so, 
what is the new wording. 

If you haven't changed anything please dispose PR. In this case no UI action 
is needed.
I switched to "Unnecessary"
Martin, can you please update the compiler preference page.
