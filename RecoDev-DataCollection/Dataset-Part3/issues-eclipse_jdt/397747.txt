The tree (test hierarchy) that Eclipse creates when running JUnit tests is wrong when adding a JUnit4 test suite (via JUnit4TestAdapter) to a JUnit3 test suite (see attached screenshot, the first added JUnit3TestCase displays under the JUnit4TestSuite but in fact it has nothing to do with it)

The culprit is most likely JUnit3TestReference where in #sendTree, for a #isJUnit4TestSuiteAdapter, a mismatch of the test count occurs:
JUnit4TestAdapter#countTestCases() counts all tests (via Description#testCount, RECURSIVELY), whereas JUnit4TestAdapter#getTests only returns its direct children (NON RECURSIVELY).

In the constellation shown in the Eclipse Project attached, this results in a mismatch as the test class JUnit4TestCase has 2 Test methods, but the JUnit4TestSuite only has 1 SuiteClass. 

What happens is that the Tree will fill up with Tests until the numbers match, hence it thinks that the JUnit3TestCase also belongs to the JUnit4TestSuite. The JUnit3TestCase added for the second time will then show correctly in the tree (see screenshot).

A possible fix would be to change JUnit3TestReference, Lines 145,146:
notified.visitTreeEntry(getIdentifier(), true, fTest.countTestCases());
List tests= (List) callJUnit4GetterMethod(fTest, "getTests"); //$NON-NLS-1$

to 
List tests= (List) callJUnit4GetterMethod(fTest, "getTests"); //$NON-NLS-1$
notified.visitTreeEntry(getIdentifier(), true, tests.size());

Markus, the patch looks right to me and works, but I'd like to have you review as well.

Sorry about that. I had the same patch as released to master. Unfortunately, I played around with the code after that and created the wrong patch.

To continue the misery, some TestRunSessionSerializationTests4 now fail (in build [1] and on my machine) due to the changes made to AbstractTestRunListenerTest.
