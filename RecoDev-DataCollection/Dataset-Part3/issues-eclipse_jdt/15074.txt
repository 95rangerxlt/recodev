If you open a java editor on a readonly file (e.g. on a class file with source 
attached), you cannot use find as it is disabled.
This was an urgent M5 fix.
As a workaround use incremental search or find next.

At least class files with read only source should be handled differently than 
read only files.

Just my 2 cents: we use PVCS as the version control tool. Most of our .java  
files are read only. The only one read/write are the ones we have checked out.
We still want to be able to search in the read only files.

I don't really understand Eric's comment? Why is the find menu disabled? Is it 
because you can also do replace through the same dialog and one cannot do 
replace in read only files? In that case, you could disable just the replace 
buttons in the dialog.
