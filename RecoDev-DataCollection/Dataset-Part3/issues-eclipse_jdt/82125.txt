I20041221-0800-gtk + 20050104 ZRH plugin export

- Run on a 1.5 JRE, but specify 1.4 source compatibility and class file generation
- Create a new type using the New Class Wizard:
  - choose to implement java.lang.Comparable
  - choose to add method stubs for inherited abstract methods
- Press "Finish" to create the type

Expected: the type erasure is respected, the added compareTo method has an
"Object" parameter

Actual: the added stub has the following signature, which results in a compile
error:

compareTo(T o)

Note: removing the method and readding it via quick fix works as expected.
Note: removing the method and readding it via Source>Implement Methods shows the
same problem as above.

Martin, Tobias, 

will this be covered by the work Tobias is doing on Override/Implements as well ?
It should be the same code as the override dialog uses.
This got fixed.
