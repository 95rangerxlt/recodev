Java SE 6 (aka "Mustang") will likely contain improvements to javadoc tags (like @category), classfile 
specification updates, pluggable annotation processing APIs, and new compiler APIs, all of which will 
require specific support. [JDT Core, JDT UI, JDT Text, JDT Debug]

JSR-202 had published updated class file format specification and details on new
verifier. I wonder what are the timeframe for incorporating these new features
into Eclipse Java compiler? Thanks.
The StackMapTable attribute support is scheduled for 3.2M4 so far.
Also see bug 109980
The list of participating components should include: JDT APT.
JDT UI/Text: For 3.2, added '@category' filter to outline, rendering categories in labels.
Why is this bug still open? Is more work going to be done for R3.2?

It was just moved to JDT/Core from JDT/UI.
At the core level, we added the generation of stack map frames. This is done by settings the source, target platform and compliance to 1.6 or 6.0.
Closing as FIXED for 3.2.
