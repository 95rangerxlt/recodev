Tutorial says to go to  http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ scroll down to 
Example Plugins and download the examples archive.

I went to that page - read carefully with eyeballs AND searched in firefox ...
nothing in there about example plugins or examples.

I've followed several dead ends that take me to the source code for eclipse that
I've already downloaded, but this would be a LOT easier if you guys could just
tell me where to get the stuff....no looking all over the page trying to guess
what the link MIGHT be called ... just a nice clean link.

I also tried to do a search for JUnit source code ... getting, of course, scads
of irrelevant dead-ends.  Just a link. That's all I want.

Hi Keith,

I have editing rights to the Platform docs and as far as I can tell the page you
refer to as the "Tutorial" would be "Creating your first Java project" found in
the the JDT doc(Java Development > Getting Started > Basic Tutorial > Creating
your first Java project ), an area I am unable to access. 

Please correct me if I am mistaken and indicate the page you are referring to.
If I am correct, please change the product field of this bug from "Platform" to
"JDT".

So assuming that I am looking at the same page as you are, there is another
directive included that was not mentioned in your note, so perhaps you did not
notice it. It says "and locate the release that you are working with". 

On the "Release Build X.X.X" page there is an "Example Plug-ins" section with
downloads available. 

Hopefully that is what you're looking for, and instead of assigning this to JDT
you can just close the bug. Best of luck either way.

Thanks,
AC
I fixed that part by inserting some missing steps (in 3.2 RC6)
