The new browser support registers an editor and avoids dependency on IDE (for 
IFileEditorInput) by using IPathEditorInput. This works great except for 
opening external files from the 'File' menu. We are receiving 
JavaFileEditorInput that we cannot handle properly.

If this class would implement IPathEditorInput, we would be able to handle 
external files correctly. The implementation is easy because 
JavaFileEditorInput also implements ILocationProvider which also returns IPath.

I can provide a patch if you want.

Implementation if IPathEditorInput

Here is the patch - very easy and will allow browser editor to work on external
files.
Can you give more context (steps to reproduce)? Did you manually bind the
browser to *.java?
This is not Java - it is just the confusing class name. The class actually 
sits in org.eclipse.ui.editors plug-in and is passed to the editor when 'File-
>Open External File...' is selected. The file itself could be anything - not 
just Java.
I know.

But what did you do to get the browser? We normally use the default text editor
when there's no mapping.
In the latest build we have registered the internal browser editor as the non-
default editor for html and htm file extensions. Therefore when I open an html 
or htm external file, the internal browser editor is activated.
Fixed in HEAD.
