Currently we have the quick fix 'exchange left and right operands for infix expression' that can be applied to == comparisons

e.g., if(a == b) --> if(b == a)

However, it would also be useful to have this quickfix for less-than, greater-than etc. - although obviously this is slightly more complex as it must take into account the change in the logic.

I believe the following would be correct:

  if(a > b)  --> if(b <= a)
  if(a >= b) --> if(b < a)
  if(a < b)  --> if(b >= a)
  if(a <= b) --> if(b > a)
