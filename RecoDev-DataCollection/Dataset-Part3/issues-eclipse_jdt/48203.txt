Hi,
when some text is selected smart semicolon does not replace the selected text
with ; but simply add the ; at the end of line.
I often found this not to be what I expected, especially when the selected text
is the last part of the line.

What build are you using? I think this has been fixed recently.

I will close the report for now, please reopen if you still see this in the
latest integration build.
Actually, the behaviour described in comment 0 is correct: if there is no
semicolon set yet, it will be smart inserted. The reason for that is that smart
semicolon must work in code completion situations (e.g. when "insert parameters"
is on for code completion), when there is a selection.

If there is already a semicolon, the selection gets replaced as expected in the
newer builds, while it used to just insert a semicolon without replacing it
earlier (this is the fix referred to in comment 1).

Is there some way for the semi-colon to know whether or not it's in a
code-completion situation?
not currently.
