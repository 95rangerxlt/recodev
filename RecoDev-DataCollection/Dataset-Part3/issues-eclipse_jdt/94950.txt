Steps to reproduce:
- Create cu with unexternalized string which has NO reference to message 
bundles (both eclipse and non-eclipse approach)
- Invoke Externalize String refactoring
- Proposed key names have format <Class>.n
- Check 'Use Eclipse's string externalization mechanism'

-> The proposed key names are invalid with the Eclipse approach
-> Wizard should regenerate keys which do not yet exist
