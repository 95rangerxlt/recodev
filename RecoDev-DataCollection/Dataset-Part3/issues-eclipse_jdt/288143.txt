Looking at code in HEAD today, I can see that ActivateEditorTest
test suite references the Performance.setComment in testActivateEditor() method. The comment given in argument is defined by return of the getDegradationComment() method which is overridden in the ActivateTextEditorTest
test suite and returns:
"This test is slower than in 3.4 due the changes in Platform UI, see bug 258253 for details."

As bug 258253 was fixed and verified in 3.5 this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests, hence I guess remove the override of the getDegradationComment() method in ActivateTextEditorTest...

Sorry, a unexpected hit on the Enter key of my keyboard with the mouse outside the text are. I need some time to learn the new Bugzilla UI... :-(
There's also a reference to Performance.setComment in OpenJavaEditorStartupTest.testJavaEditorStartup() saying:

"The startup of Eclipse SDK (Java perspective) with open Java editor performance has been decreased due to general start-up time degradation. " +
"See the org.eclipse.core.tests.runtime.perf.UIStartupTest.testUIApplicationStartup performance test on the detailed org.eclipse.core " +
"performance results page."

I think this comment should also be removed.
There's another reference to Performance.setComment in ContentTypeTest.testPluginXMLDirty() saying:

"Test is slower because a new XML content types got added. See: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=182337"

As bug 182337 is targeted to 3.6M2, I also would suggest to remove the comment and see if the failing will be really back to normal when the depending bug will be fixed...
And finally for JDT/Text, there's a last reference to Performance.setComment in
OpenTextEditorStartupTest.testTextEditorStartup() saying:

"The startup with open Text editor performance has been decreased due to general start-up time degradation. " +
"See the org.eclipse.core.tests.runtime.perf.UIStartupTest.testUIApplicationStartup performance test on the detailed org.eclipse.core " +
"performance results page."

I think this comment should also be removed.
Fixed first issue in HEAD. The other issues are known and will for sure happen again during 3.6 dev (startup because there are more bundles, XML test because there are additional content types), so I'll leave it in for now.
