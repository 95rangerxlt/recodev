Smart semicolon could be cleverer in single quotes.
Having the cursor inside 'a' and press ';' you get 'a;' which is probbaly not
what is intended.
Another point is that for double quotes, smart semicolon is 'cleever' and jumps
to the end of the line (here it would make more sense to stay in the string area)

Having a consistent behavior for single and double quoted would be good to have.

yes, we should register the SmartSemicolonAutoEditStrategy for string partitions
as well. Marking as P2 to give it visibility as this is an easy fix.
