	1) smoke test setup	
	2) open VectorTest in the type hierarchy
	3) rename type TestCase to TestCase2
	4) observe: the type hierarchy shows VectorTest as a subclass of Object, not TestCase2, event
		though the source says VectorTest extends TestCase2.

EG (6/12/2001 12:52:48 AM)
	workaround is to close and reopen hierarchy.
