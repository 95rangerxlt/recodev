InlineMethodTests#testUseInLocalClass() uses .../import_in/Provider.java, which
does not compile with 1.5 due to this declaration:

	public void useInLocalClass() {
		class Local extends File implements Comparable {
			public Local(String s) {
				super(s);
			}
			public void foo(Map map) {
			}
			public int compareTo(Object o) {
				return 0;
			}
		}
	}

Class 'File' already implements 'Comparable<File>', which leads to an error when
'Comparable' is also declared as superinterface.

I disabled the test in the migration to running tests with 1.5 level.
Dirk, please decide whether you want to adapt the test, and/or leave the
original version in an 1.3/1.4 project.

Fixed for M4.
