Organize imports tries to generate imports for inner classes. This is
obviuosly bound to fail.

How to reproduce:

1. create a class "Foo" in the default package with the following content:

public class Foo {
	private class Bar {
	}
	private void test() {
		new Bar();
	}
}

2. "Organzze imports"

3. The following broken import is added:

import .Foo.Bar;

---
I really hope that his is not a duplicate, but although there are quite a lot of 
bugs concerning "organize imports" I could not find a bug describing this 
behavior.
