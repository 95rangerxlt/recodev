R2.1 RC1

From the java editor popup menu "Search -> Occurrences in file" on an item that 
will generate one or more matches.

Note the number of matches.

Now insert another instance of the item you searched for and press save to 
recompile the class.

RMB in the search view and "Search again"

It won't find the new occurrence.   Either the search again should be disabled 
or it should do the search again.    I prefer the later.

This can't be fixed for 2.1 since the search engine requires an operation to 
redo the search. This would means that we have to hang onto the AST which is 
from a memory point of view to expensive.

Fix is to disable the search again action for this case.
