I was in the middle of changing key names of a large file. I accidently hit 
enter (because I feel like hitting enter to commit the change in the cell 
editor). This triggered 'Finish' with all the unwanted changes, ugly key names 
and wrong subsitution pattern (because it follows on the second page).

What I do now is:
  1. Select all table entries
  2. Mark them Skip
  3. Fill prefix
  4. Go to second page
  5. Fill substitution pattern
  6. Go back to first page.
  7. Select first entry in table
  8. Mark 'translate'
  9. Change key name
  10. Select next entry in table and go to step 8 until done.

It's not what I call a smooth workflow...

i can maybe make 'next' the default button
will that suffice?
it would for me...
fixed by making 'next' default - for the nls wizard
