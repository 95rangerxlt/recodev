JDT UI should add support for 1.9 compiler compliance on the Java Compiler preference page. In 1.9 compliance, the JCP disclaimer should be shown as a warning:

> This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java
> Community Process (JCP) and is made available for testing and evaluation purposes
> only. The code is not compatible with any specification of the JCP.

Since 1.9 source and target levels are not supported yet, we should not offer them in the UI. But if they are manually set in .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs, the UI should still show them and treat them correctly.
