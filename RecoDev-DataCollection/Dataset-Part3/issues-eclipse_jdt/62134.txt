The JUnit plugin ignores any custom environment variables in the debug 
configuration. 
I've made the necessary changes in the Environment settings to add the path to 
a custom JNI library I'm using, but the plugin doesn't incorporate these into 
the runtime debug environment properly.

I've verified that my settings work fine in normal debug mode and inspected the 
java.library.path system property to confirm the missing path entries.

This bug may be related to bug #60243
I'm using Eclipse version 3.0 M8

The JUnit launcher does not set the environment variables on the 
VMRunnerConfiguration. This is a new feature that was added in 3.0. For 
example, the launcher should do something like this:

String[] envp= DebugPlugin.getDefault().getLaunchManager().getEnvironment
(launchConfiguration);
...
vmRunnerConfig.setEnvironment(envp);
Erich, can you look into this for 3.0.
fixed
