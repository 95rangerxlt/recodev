if the 'get' strategy fails, then we can guess the name from the declared type

so, for example:
IJavaElement[] elements= ....
int type= elements[i].getElementType();

selecting elements[i] does not guess the correct name currently
but guessing 'element' or 'javaElement' should be very easy with jcore support
