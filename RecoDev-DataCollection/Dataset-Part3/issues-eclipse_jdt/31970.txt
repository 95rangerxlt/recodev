M5 build

- org.eclipse.ui module in source, rest in binary
- in Package Explorer, 
- Navigate / Go To / Resource...
- type sync (looking for synced.gif under org.eclipse.ui\icons\full\clcl16)
- no match
- type *.gif
- it's missing all of the gifs in this folder

My Package Explorer filter settings are not set to filter out non-Java 
elements.  These files show up in the Package Explorer, but not in Go To 
Resource.
