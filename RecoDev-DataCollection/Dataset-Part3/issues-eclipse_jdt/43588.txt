if you have a really long java name that goes off the edge of the editor and 
you use smart cursor positioning feature the window does not scroll to where 
the cursor is unless you reach the end of that word with the caret.

e.g. if Ctrl-Right Arrow ends up in the middle of a word but outside the 
visible area the window does not scroll to that point!

Tobias, you need to reveal the caret (see smart home/end as an example).

I'll fix it.

Fixed in HEAD.

Verified that
- row:column indication works
- selection is revealed when navigation forward and backward

There was one missing issue: the parameter hints were not updated caused by the
fact that a VerifyKeyListener is used which only listens for <- and ->. Improved
this by using an additional selection changed listener.
