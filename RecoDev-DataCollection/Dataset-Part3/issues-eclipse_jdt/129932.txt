Build id: I20051215-1506

Scenario:
1. Run Eclipse using -rtl attribute.
2. Open the preferences window: Window -> Preferences.
3. Selece from tree: Java -> Code Style -> Formatter.
Result: The code in the preview window is in RTL ordering. 

Since it contains source code it should have LTR ordering.

Likely JDT-UI is not passing the right flags to created this editor.

Tod probably can help here.
Dani, can I give you this bug? I don't know exactly where the rtl/ltr configuration is done. We're using the JavaSourceViewer and if it's true what is claimed in comment 0, all viewers containing source should use LTR.
This has been fixed a while ago.
