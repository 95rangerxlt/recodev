Since M3 was released I have to have "Go Into Top Level Type" selected or I
cannot navigate using the outline view.  If I move around in the editor
window the outline highlight syncs fine, but selecting fields or methods
(or anything) in the outline view does not cause the editor to sync.

If I select the "Go Into Top Level Type" option w/in the outline view then
the editor is syncs fine.

This is fixed in M5 and later.
