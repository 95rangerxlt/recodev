(M5 build)
In Navigator view (resource perspective), right-click on a src/ directory
containing your sources, select export->jar file and the package selector
opens with no resource selected (and finish button disabled); but it seems
that the src/ dir is really selected, because if you re-select it in the window,
it ends up with a "jar creation failed" and a lot of duplicate entries in the
error log.
If you try the same from the Projects view (Java browsing perspective), it
works fine.

Daniel, I was able to reproduce, excpet that the user gets a dialog and nothing 
in the log. Can you please comment on this. Is IMO not critical for 2.1 since 
it works from the package explorer and nothing shows up in the log.
The JAR exporter works on Java resources.
Most likely a bug when converting the folder to the Java element (source folder).

Will fix for 2.1 only if trivial.


Fixed.
