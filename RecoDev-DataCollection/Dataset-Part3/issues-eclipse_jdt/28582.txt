In presence of problems, one cannot see an error icon in the left ruler, since

The only error indication is the underlining in the code itself.

Build 20021216

In presence of problems, one cannot see an error icon in the left ruler, since 
it get overlapped completely with the quickfix icon.

The only error indication is the underlining in the code itself.
Possible solutions are:
- use two different quickfix icons
- use transient quickfix icons

Transient/alpha blending looks ugly.
Now use red and yellow light bulb.
Red light bulb will look better as soon as provided by art worker.
