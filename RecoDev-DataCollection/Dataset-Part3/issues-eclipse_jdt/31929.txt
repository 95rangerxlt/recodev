build i2003-02-14, win2k, J9

I have "hide closed projects" selected in my filter settings for the packages 
explorer view. When I exit my workspace and come back in, the Packages Explorer 
only displays some of my open projects. When I change the filter settings to 
show closed projects (hit ok) and then back to hiding the closed projects, the 
display is correct.

I also see other weird results with that filter turned on.

- File -> New -> Java Project with default src source folder
- File -> New -> Java Class -> Main (in default package)
- note that Packages Explorer is showing "src" and "bin" as regular folders
- note that Main.java is not visible in this View
- when I turn off the Closed Project filter and then turn it back on, 
everything is ok


The problem was that IJavaProject.isOpen is a complete different check than 
IProject.isOpen. Now using only IProject.isOpen();

Fixed for build > I20030214
