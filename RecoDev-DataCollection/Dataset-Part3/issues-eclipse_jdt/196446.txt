*Overview Description:
If the static import feature is used, the NLS hyperlink navigation(Ctrl+click) for NLS field doesn't work anymore .
-Expected result : Opens the .properties file and select the referenced key.
-Actual result : Opens the Message.java class and selects the referenced field.

*Steps to Reproduce :
Let's say you have a class org.nls.Messages that extends org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS and that defines two keys that are translated in the messages.properties file.

import static org.nls.Messages.*;
import org.nls.Messages;

public class Test {

    String myString1 = Test_0;          /* uses static import*/
    String myString2 = Messages.Test_1; /* classic access */
}


If you click (Ctrl+click) on "Test_1" ("Messages.Test_1"), the messages.properties file is opened and the referenced key is revealed.

If you click (Ctrl+click) on "Test_0", the Messages.java (wich extends NLS) file is opened and the referenced field is revealed.

- Also Occurs on  eclipse 3.2.1.
