Linux/Motif, 20020530
I got in a state where pressing Tab in the Java text editor caused the focus to
move from the editor to the global toolbar. At this point it was impossible for
me to insert a tab into the editor. Closing the editor and re-opening fixed the
problem.

I do *not* have the "insert spaces instead of tabs" option on.

I could not replicate.

I've since upgraded to 20020531. This has happened four times, it's a really
serious detriment to writing code.
