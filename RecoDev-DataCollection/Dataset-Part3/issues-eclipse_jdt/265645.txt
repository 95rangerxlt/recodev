Set the font.
Raksha, your fix does fix the problem but I'd like to better (more generically) fix the font issue: there is no need to have all the setFont calls if we use org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.Dialog.applyDialogFont(Control) as last call in createDialogArea(...).

Set the font in createDialogArea(composite).

Raksha, you should remove all calls to setFont.

Had left out calls to setFont in createDialogArea(). Removed them now.
