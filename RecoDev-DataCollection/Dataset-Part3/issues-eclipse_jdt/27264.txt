Diagnosis:
Deltas for of type CHANGED for PackageFragments always cause the Package 
Explorer to refresh, even in the case where the only change is to a CU 
contained in the PackageFragment. Better evaluation needed (i.e. evaluate 
delta flags). Will Fix.

JRT.
Setting to P1/cirtical since performance/space is the big item for M4

btw, the traces i gave are useless because they're expanded to a level that 
give 0 information (i guess you noticed already :-))

Could you add better ones since you're hunting performance issues anyway?
thanx
