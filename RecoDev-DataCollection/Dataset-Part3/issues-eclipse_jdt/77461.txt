Instead of having the current check box for inlining I would prefer having one
saying "Create delegate in source compilation unit". This makes it more clear
what we are doing.

When checked we should provide support to deprecated the delegate.
For M3: Changed UI to one checkbox "Create delegate in source compilation unit"
Support to deprecate the delegator is on the way...
