The UI should support the following new JDT Core feature:
Search for field read and field write references. Two new constants have been 
added on IJavaSearchConstants to be used when creating a field reference search 
pattern:
    - READ_REFERENCES: the search results contain *only* read access to a field.
    - WRITE_REFERENCES: the search results contain *only* write access to a 
field.

If REFERENCES is used, then search results contain both read and write accesss 
to a field.
