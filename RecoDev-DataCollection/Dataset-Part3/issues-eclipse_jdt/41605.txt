Javadoc hovers now always say "Press F2 for focus". This doesn't work unless the
editor has focus.

Steps to reproduce:
- open a java file
- activate Outline View
- point your mouse to a JavaElement in the source
- press F2 -> nothing happens

The F2 hint should probably not be displayed if the editor is not active.

Similar issue:
- Split editors to have two editor areas
- In the first area, set the text caret to a hoverable java element
- Without clicking, hover over another element in the second editor
- Press F2

=> A sticky hover is shown at the caret position in the active editor.
=> The unsticky hover of the element in the second editor persists (including
its unobeyed affordance).
Fixed.
