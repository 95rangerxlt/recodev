Build ID: M20090211-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1. place the cursor in the middle of a method selector
2. Shift-Alt-R to rename it
3. Ctrl-Backspace to delete first part of selector
4. Ctrl-Delete to delete rest of selector
5. type new name
6. Return

A dialog pops up saying:
Could not create a method handle for project '{0}' with handle identifier '=YouProject/src<your.packagepath{YourClass.java[YourClass~yourMethod~QYourArgtype;'

Reproducable in 3.4.2 but NOT in 3.4.1

Initial debugging yields:
+ the method handle memento is OK, but the method cannot be found in the java model.
+ refactoring tries to undo the editing but step 5. is missing from the undo history! => Method is not present in the java model due to missing selector.

Fix
Fixed in HEAD.

Unfortunately, this sneaked in with the fix for bug 248254. Workaround is to not use Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Delete. Instead, you can use Edit > Expand Selection To > Enclosing Element (Alt+Shift+Up) to select the whole name.

> Fixed in HEAD.

On 3.4.2 I keep running into this bug, with various "gestures" for replacing 
a (part of a) name. Thus, I'd propose the fix to be back-ported, in case
there'll ever be a 3.4.3. Makes sense?

There is no 3.4.3 release, ever ;-)
