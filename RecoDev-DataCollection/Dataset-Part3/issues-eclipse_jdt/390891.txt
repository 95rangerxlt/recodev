BETA_JAVA8:

This is to track follow up issue to the redesign work:

    - One more round of (self) review.
    - Verify that for all changed methods in the Parser, subclass methods
      were also suitably modified.
    - Make sure that we reject annotations at all places where the grammar
      is over permissive.
    - Verify that HasTypeAnnotations bit is consistently set.
    - Coverage tests based on grammar rules.
    - Verify that all grammar rules have proper compliance.
    - All consume methods should have proper new rules updated in comments.
    - Verify that AssistParser handles type references correctly

Various minor fixes pushed via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=0edf714bfdc0b0cf6f1e623d20bbac3ec3bfa5d0
The following items will be reviewed as part of code review 
for bug 383624 as these are really code generation concerns:

All instances of getAllAnnotationContexts
AnnotationContext
AnnotationTargetTypeConstants
AnnotationCollector
Annotation#getLocations
Annotation#isRuntimeInvisible
Annotation#isRuntimeVisible
Annotation#isRuntimeTypeInvisible
Annotation#isRuntimeTypeVisible
Pending activities on this bug:

    - Verify that for all changed methods in the Parser, subclass methods
      were also suitably modified.
    - Make sure that we reject annotations at all places where the grammar
      is over permissive.
    - Coverage tests based on grammar rules.
I have completed the code review and pending activities on this bug:

    - Coverage tests based on grammar rules.
    - One more round of spec review.
Added several tests for grammar coverage and spec review completed
too.

Resolving.
