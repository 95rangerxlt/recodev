patch

Back-port of the fix. This patch is slightly different than the other back-ports because we did not have tracing options at all for JDT debug in 3.4. 

The changes include the addition of the .options file, the addition of the JDIDebugOptions class and a single change to JDIDebugPlugin#start
Applied the patch to 3.4.2+
