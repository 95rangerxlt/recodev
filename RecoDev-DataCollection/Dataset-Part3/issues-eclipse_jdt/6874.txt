Build 20011211

I recently made changes to DeleteResourceAction, changing the UI for project 
deletion (and some small changes to the title in the non-project case).

The packages view still gets the old UI, as if it has copied the code.

Is there any reason it can't just reuse DeleteResourceAction?

there are several reasons why we cannot reuse DeleteResourceAction:
the simplest being that resources are just a fraction of what we have to deal 
with - other than that we have source folders, external and internal jars, 
packages, and sub-cu elements. 

some of them (like) source folders require classpath upadting on deletion,
some do not even have a resource - like external jars (we do not delete the 
external jar - jus tremove it from the classpath).
some (like packages) need special treatment when deleting.
sub-cu elements, like methods, are yet another story.

so, in addition to the 3 kinds of entities that live in the navigator's reality 
we have a whole bunch of other things we have to deal with.
In that case, I recommend delegating to DeleteResourceAction for the project 
case.
fixed as suggested
