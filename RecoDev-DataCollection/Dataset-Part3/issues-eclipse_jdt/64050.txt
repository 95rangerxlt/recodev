Any edit action first unfolds the folded element.
however, in the case where a folded region is replaced (deleted) entirely, we
could do without expanding. Also, when we expand, the selection should be
updated. If a folded method is selected, and I press delete, I lose the
selection and cannot simply hit delete a second time to actually do what I intended.
