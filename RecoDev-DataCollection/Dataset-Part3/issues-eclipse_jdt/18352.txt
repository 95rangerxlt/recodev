Build F1

The first time that you open an editor on a file with warnings and errors, the 
error (solid red box) and warning (solid orange box) markers will briefly 
appear in the ruler on the right hand side of the editor. However these are 
quickly replaced by Quick Fix markers (hollow red box).

If you edit and save the file, the error and warning markers re-appear.

error (solid red box) and warning (solid orange box) markers will briefly

quickly replaced by Quick Fix markers (hollow red box).

If you edit and save the file, the error and warning markers re-appear.
The darker ones are annotations based on problem markers (saved state) while the
brighter ones are based on temporary problems. Depending on your setting
(Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Annotations, Analyze annotations while
typing) you will mostly see the problems either darker (disabled) or the
brighter ones (enabled).

There were problem in shadowing the marker problems with the temporary ones this
is now fixed. Please reopen if you still see this in builds > N20030130.

Note: When you open an editor it is OK that you first quickly see the dark
annotations which are immediately overlaid by the temporary problem annotations.
