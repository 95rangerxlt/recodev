Build 20020328

Form the news group (Veronika Irvine):

>- FileTransfer: only contains valid data if a file or folder (package,
project) is selected. So you get no data if a method,
>   field, ... is selected since they aren't files or folders.
>- ReourceTransfer: only contains valid data if an IResource is selected.
>- LocalSelectionTransfer (internal): contains the actual selected elements.

Just as aside, it is possible in the dragStart event to modify the Transfer
types available using setTransfer().  Perhaps PackageExplorerPart should set
the transfer types based on what was selected when the DND operation that
was initiated - then the "Do not enter" cursor will appear rather than the
null data scenario.
