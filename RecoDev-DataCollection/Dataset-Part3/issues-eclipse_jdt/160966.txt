If you specify an @Override annotation on a method that does not override a method in a superclass you correctly get a compiler error stating as much.  It would be nice if there were a quick fix for this problem to remove the offending annotation.  Another possible fix would be to add the missing superclass method, but this possibly less useful.

A similar fix could be provided when you specify an annotation in the wrong position (like on a constructor)

quick fixes added to
- remove @Override annotation 
- added new method declarations in the super types

The second suggestion should be covered in an other bug, if you think it's important.
