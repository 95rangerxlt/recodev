For example:

- open the template edit dialog
- invoke the code assist
- press escape
- not only is the code assist cancelled, but also the dialog!

or

- invoke a template in the java editor
- invoke parameter hints on a method call (ctrl-shift-space)
- press escape
- not only the parameter hints are closed, but also template editing is 
finished!

This is quite inconvenient behaviour...

*** Bug 70206 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Fixed first part of problem (bug 53451) and adapted summary.
This is not minor. I've set 'Esc' to close the editor and this bug makes it close when I want to dismiss the parameter hints.

Fixed in HEAD.
