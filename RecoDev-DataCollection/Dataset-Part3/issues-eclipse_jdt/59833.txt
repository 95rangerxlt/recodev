If I roll over a set of annotations in the java editor, and then Alt+Tab to a
different application, the pop-up shells remain on top of the other application.
I think these shells should close when they lose focus.

See this, too. This is because the standard closer does not listen for focus
events. The same applies to other hovers in the overview and annotation rulers.

We should track focus changes.
I've fixed this some time ago.
