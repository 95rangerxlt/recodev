Build 20021115.

I have a class defined as follows.  If I line-select the method run, copy and 
paste it, the method is indented another level (vs. maintaining the level that 
all the other methods are on).  This is undesirable behavior.

public class ObjectAction1Delegate
	extends ActionDelegate
	implements IObjectActionDelegate, IMenuCreator {

	public void run(IAction action) {
	}
	public void dispose() {
	}
	public Menu getMenu(Menu m) {
		return null;
	}
	public Menu getMenu(Control c) {
		return null;
	}
}

fixed a long time ago.
