Screenshot - 'default' in Extract Method dialog

As per JSR 335 Part H and bug 401223:
"To avoid confusion with the default modifier, the access level given implicitly to unmodified declarations in classes is now referred to as package access rather than default access;"

The access modifier 'default' used in different dialogs related to methods (like Extract Method, Change Method Signature), could now be changed to 'package-access' or something else to avoid confusion with the modifier 'default' used to declare a default method.

Good catch. Please make a pass over the whole JDT UI and replace 'default' access with 'package' access everywhere in the UI. E.g. in the dialogs, the access modifier should be called 'package' (not 'package-access').

Don't touch identifiers in our code at this time. In new code, we will use 'package' in identifiers, but it's not worth the hassle if we rename APIs or even internal helper methods. Also make sure you don't touch unrelated occurrences of the term 'default', e.g. in '(default package)'.

Patch

Replaced 'default' with 'package' everywhere in the UI, taking care of the points mentioned in comment #1.

Markus, please review.
Please have a look at the mnemonics again. You e.g. changed

    SelfEncapsulateFieldInputPage_default=defa&ult

to packag&e, but the "&e" is not free.

The case in NewTypeWizardPage is quite tricky. Hint: You can trade the "&u" for a "&c" from "&Constructors from superclass".


I found more occurrences that need to be updated, e.g. 
56: NLSAccessorConfigurationDialog_default= (default) 
636: MembersOrderPreferencePage_default_label=Default 

Please do File Search for regex "d&?e&?f&?a&?u&?l&?t" in *.properties files again and check occurrences in code, unless the label clearly rules out a match (hint: Ctrl+Click in the *.properties file should take you to the referencing code).

After this is done, please let Manju review the new patch and then release it to BETA_JAVA8.

Used "&a", which was available.

Thanks for the hint.
 
> 56: NLSAccessorConfigurationDialog_default= (default) 
This is not updated as it represents the '(default)' label next to the package field in dialog. 
Same with, 91: NewTypeWizardPage_default=(default)

> 636: MembersOrderPreferencePage_default_label=Default 
Done. 
Also updated, 502: JavadocProblemsConfigurationBlock_default=Default
These were missed as I did a case sensitive search earlier.

Attached the patch with changes. Manju, Please review.
The patch has updated all the relevant occurrence of 'default' with 'package'. One point found is in the new type creation wizard, if user enable 'Enclosing type', then below mnemonics are being shared:
1. pa&ckage / stati&c => c
2. pro&tected / abs&tract => t
3. pri&vate / public static &void main => v

We need to do one more cycle of round robin and find the right mnemonics for each of them.

Otherwise the patch looks good to go.
(In reply to comment #5)
Thanks Manju. 

As discussed, the above mnemonics are shared only when we enable 'Enclosing type' and also there is no other letter that could be used here. 
And since it is still possible to use the same mnemonic to access the shared fields, we will keep it as it is.
