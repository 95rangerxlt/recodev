On the first build when the __generated_src folder is created, the Builder 
needs to have its source paths updated with the new source path information.  
We end up with a build error, because the builder has stale source path info.  

This may only occurr if the __generated_src folder is a child of another src 
folder "parent".  In this case, the builder thinks that files in the 
__generated_src folder are rooted at the "parent", and you get a build error 
that the expected package is wrong.

Patch for APT branch o.e.jdt.core.  Changes to o.e.jdt.apt.core are not included.

submitted changes to apt.core to get the fact that we updated the project's 
classpath back to AptCompilationParticipant.  When the attached patch gets 
submitted, we need to fix up AptCopmilationParticipant to use the new 
PreBuildCompilationResult constructor.  This should all be in there and all 
you need to do is uncomment two lines of code.  Search for "103745". 



Also, there is a regression test for this bug.  When the patch is applied, 
enable AptBuilder#disabled_testGeneratedFileInBuilder_ProjectRootAsSourceDir() 
by renaming to testGeneratedFileInBuilder_ProjectRootAsSourceDir().



should be fixed.  Frederic checked in teh patch & I enabled the regression 
test.
