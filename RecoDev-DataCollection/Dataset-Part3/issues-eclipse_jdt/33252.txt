Selecting "Show in Package Exploreer" from an editor results in the following
message: Couldn't reveal the selected element in Package Explorer. May be the
element is filtered out."

This only occurs when the Package Explorer is in hierarchical mode.

As a side note, is "May be" spelt correctly?

this occurs in RC1
The problem is that in hierarchical mode the parent chain doesn't map to the 
model's parent chain. Hence we don't find the element. Have to tweak 
internalGetParent in the content provider to solve this.
Only happens if source folders are used

Fixed for RC2.
