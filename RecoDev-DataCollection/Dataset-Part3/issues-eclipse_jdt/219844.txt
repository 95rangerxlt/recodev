I20080220-1400, as seen in today's stand-up demo

- open a Java Editor
- restart workbench
- F2 does not work

Problem is that JavaInformationProvider.update() silently fails when active page is not available (which apparently happens during startup).

Furthermore, the 'fCurrentPerspective != perspectiveId' there is wrong. I also fail to see why a new JavaTypeHover must be created for *all* Java editors on the first partActivated or partBroughtToTop event that happens after (not during!) a perspective switch.

We could consider it a bug when the editor gets created on a non-active page. But not really important here as our code here is really crazy and most of it useless.

Fixed in HEAD.
