It should be possible to drag&drop a type on the empty type hierarchy view to 
set its focus.

It should be possible to drag&drop a type on the empty type hierarchy view to 
set its focus.
Once we fxied this we should change the wording. JJ suggests the following 
wording:

   "Select a type (for example in the outline view or in the 
    editor), and use its 'Open Type Hierarchy' menu choice to 
    display its type hierarchy here. Alternatively, drag and 
    drop a type onto this view." 

fixed and changed the message
