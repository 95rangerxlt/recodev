One step in that direction will be released for the Java editor in I20030812:
the goto next error/warning will be configurable i.e. you can check "Tasks"
and then you can step through them using the "Next" key shortcut (default:
Ctrl+.). Of course the same is available for "Previous".

There are plans to provide this for the text editor as well.
The go to next/previous annotation can be configure using the arrows' drop down
menu. You can then use the next/prev key binding to navigate. There are no plans
to add key bindings for individual annotations since they can be contributed by
other plug-ins.

For the text editor see bug 47060.
