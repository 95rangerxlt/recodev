The Javadoc for ImportRewrite.create(ICompilationUnit, boolean) contains the self-referential line:

"Note that {@link #create(ICompilationUnit, boolean)} is more efficient than this method if an AST for the compilation unit is already available."

The "ICompilationUnit" should be "CompilationUnit".

See ImportRewrite.create(CompilationUnit, boolean), which makes the claim that it is more efficient than the subject method if an AST is already available.
