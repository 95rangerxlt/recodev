Some projects have lots of libraries associated and it's annoying to have all of
them showing up.

It should exist an option to group all libraries in a item that could be
expanded to show all libraries.

You can use user defined libraries to group libraries in the why you want to
group them. Go Window->Preferences->Java->Build Path->User Libraries. Define the
once you want and add the library to the class path of the project. 

One additional benefit is that user libraries can be shared between projects.

Adding a generic library node isn't on the list for 3.1.
The proposed solution is more of a workaround since most projects don't share
the same set of libraries.

This is just an enhacement, and a trivial one I think, since you already support
the group of a determined set of libraries. This is just the mother of all groups :)

You stated that it isn't on the list for 3.1. Is it on the list for 3.1.1? ;-)

Thanks for answering so fast and for making such a great tool. Keep up the good
work.

There's a new option in the package explorer's view menu (triangle): "Show 'Referenced Libraries' Node"

But WST requires 3.2 core. Since I am a JSP, web apps developer, and therefore cannot use 3.3, the clutter of jars is practically unresolved as far as my workspace is concerned.
