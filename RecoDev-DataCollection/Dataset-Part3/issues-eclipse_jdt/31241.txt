- create a project
- create a source folder ui and link it to the ui folder of org.eclipse.jdt.ui
  observe: you get lots of error messages due to missing imports
- now rename the source folder to ui2

Observe: you get a progress bar in the application window. The progress gos to 
95% really quick and then states there for 40 seconds. Furthermore no tasks are 
presented.

defer - PerformChangeOperation assumes that creating a change and performing it 
will take the same time

for some refactorings it's the change creation that is more expensive 
(typically those that use TextChangeManager (which is most))
for some others, creation is trivial, performing is expansive (renamis a source 
folder is one example)

fixing would require removing the 1/1 assumption from PerformChangeOperation 
in some general way (maybe ask the refactoring object ?)

as this problem is not really critial for 2.1 i will defer its resolution
please reopen if you feel strongly
But I think we should fix the missing label. Only seeing the progress bar looks 
strange.
reverted to using the progres monitor dialog for performing refactoring changes
because the status line is unpredicible (sometimes it prints the message, 
sometimes not) and behaves very differenly wrt to labels compared to the dialog 
(which behaves ok)

reporting seems ok now
closing as fixed
