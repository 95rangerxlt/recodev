Build Identifier: Version: 3.7.2 Build id: M20120208-0800

In jdi.jar from org.eclipse.jdt.debug, com.sun.jdi.event.EventSet is defined as such:

public interface EventSet extends Mirror , Collection {
...

In all versions of the JDI javadoc since 1.4.2, it is defined as:

public interface EventSet
extends Mirror, Set

Code that compiles against the Sun/Oracle version of JDI, and rely on the fact that it is a Set, doesn't run inside Eclipse.

Reproducible: Always

A good candidate to backport?

I was thinking no, mainly because it is an API change (non-breaking), but aside from that it would be a good fix.

Opened bug 385861 for the backport.
