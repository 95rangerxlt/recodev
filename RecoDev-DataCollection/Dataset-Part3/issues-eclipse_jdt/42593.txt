public class X {
	void foo(String[] s, boolean b) {}
	void bar() {
		foo(new String[] {"A", "B"}, true);
	}
}

- place cursor before "B"
- press Ctrl+Shift+Space
- expected: Parameter Hint with "String[] s" made bold
- was: "boolean b" is bold

- place cursor just before B (after ")
-> beep, no parameter hint is shown

the current algo uses the comma to determine which parameter to highlight, but
does not account for inner scopes (as array initializers). It does check the
partition already, though.
