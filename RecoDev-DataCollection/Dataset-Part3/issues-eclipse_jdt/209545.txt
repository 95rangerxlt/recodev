I'd like a shortcut which allows to run the test which I'm currently writing (as described in this blog: http://www.vasanth.in/2007/11/09/EclipsePluginJUintRunner.aspx). The default shortcut should be "Alt+Shift+X, Z".

Maybe you can merge the code from JUnitRunner into the junit plugin.

You can already select a method in the package explorer or outline and run it as a single test with the normal Run As JUnit action. 
It's just when you start it out of the editor, that we don't analyze if you are over a method. We can added that.
However, I don't think it needs a new shortcut.
If you don't give it its own shortcut, how do you distinguish between "run all tests" and "run the current test"? This is obvious when you start from the outline: you can select the class or a method. Will you do the same in the editor?

Otherwise, it might be nice to be able to chose between the two with a single key press.
It will depend on the cursor location. Between methods: Type. On a method: Method.
We could also think of limiting it to the method name.

We don't want to add another launch shortcut to the menu (it would mean to add two, JUnit test, JUnit plug-in test). Adding new shortcuts is also always a problem, as there is always the danger of conflicting with another product.

That sounds like a viable compromise. Changing the behavior to use the enclosing method of the selection would be too big a change.
Fixed in HEAD.

We run a single test method now when the selection is inside the method name. To jump to the method name, you can e.g. use Ctrl+Shift+Up (Navigate > Go To > Previous Member).

Why not not take this approach? This would avoid the needing to learn the Ctrl+Shift+Up (Navigate > Go To >
Previous Member) shortcut
You assume that everybody wants to run only individual tests, but that's not the case. When I run a whole test class, then modify a few test method bodies and then start tests again, I don't expect to only run a single test method, just because the caret happened to be inside a method body.
