Perform 'organize imports' against a class that has 
    import javax.naming.* 
in it, and has 2 jars on the classpath that both contain  
javax.naming.InitialContext. 
You will get a dialog asking which type to import.  In the list, 
you will see 'javax.naming.InitialContext' twice in the list.

Can change 'Organize imports' so that it recognizes that these are the 
same package/class and does NOT prompt the user to choose between the same 
class?
