R2.1

==> IndexOutOfBoundsException
Fixed the exception by catching the case where the string in
HTML2TextReader.html2text(String) is null or empty.

The Javadoc is now shown without exception but it looks quite ugly. There seems
to be another problem either with the Javadoc itself, our HTML2TextReader and/or
JavaDoc2HTMLTextRenderer.

Needs further investigation.
