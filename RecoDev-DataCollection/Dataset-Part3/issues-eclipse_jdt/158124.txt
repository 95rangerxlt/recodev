Java search result page does not update annotations when a filter is enabled/disabled.

public class Try {
	Try nonDoc;
	/**
	 * @see Try
	 */
	int doc;
}

- Search for references to Try
- annotations in editor show up depending on the current filter settings
- switch view menu > Filter Javadoc
=> annotations not updated, out of sync with Search view

This worked fine in 3.1.2. The rendering of the filtered search results could be modified on Preferences > Editors > Text Editors > Annotations.

The functionality has probably been lost in rev 1.56 of JavaSearchResultPage. Before, filter changes caused the input to be re-set (in filtersChanged(..)), which in turn created all annotations from scratch.
fixed in 3.3 > 20061003
