It would be nice if when you select create a new package, the package field 
would be pre-populated with, if present, the selected package or enclosing 
package of the selected file.

we could be more supportive here, so when junit.framework is selected we could 
offer "junit." as the default text.

defer to after 2.0
*** Bug 7551 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
What about reopening this bug for 2.1? This seems to be forgotten. It is really 
annoying to type the full package name again and again and again. I wouldn't 
say this is an enhancement any more. It is rather a bug when using the new 
hierarchical tree view of packages in the Package Explorer
Was planning on voting for this bug but didn't see that functionality so I will
just cast my vote to get this annoying bug fixed in the comments.
feature is in 2.1
