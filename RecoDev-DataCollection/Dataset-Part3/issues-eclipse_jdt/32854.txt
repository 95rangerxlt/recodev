Martin, please comment.
could reproduce (do not make an changes after invoking 'local rename', just use 
the mouse to set the cursor to another name, and invoke CTRL+1) 

The LinkedPositionManager is created withe the default constructor (canCoexist 
== false)

moving to jdt.text

Confirmed using I20030611
