Hi,

I just started eclipse and installed the 1.5 JDT upgrade for Java 5 support, but
this one breaks the functionality, that you can create a missing method from the
error context menu.

If you need further details, I made two screenshots which I can provide to
illustrate the behaviour. After uninstalling the add on everything worked fine
again. I am using JDK 1.4.2_04 at the moment.

Best regards,
Oliver

Suspecting this to be talking about quickfix.
Lowering severity since this isn't major. 1.5 is still experimental.
works in 3.1 M2
