1. When opening the refactoring on a method to modify the method signature, a 
label at the bottom of the dialog says 'Specify the new order...'
This message is strangely located. The indent is confusing.

I suggest that the StatusDialog is used, (where the message background is 
different, and that the message gets an 'Info' image.

Agree, we should improve this for 2.1
Now in all case an icon is prefixed to the message. Regarding the background 
color: this is hardcoded in MessageLine and I am reluctent to copy this. Using 
hardcoded colors will not work on all platform. 

Opened a PR against Platform/UI.

Can't use the status dialog since the dialog needs a progress bar with is 
overloaded with the message line.
