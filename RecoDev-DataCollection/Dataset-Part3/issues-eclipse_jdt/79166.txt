jdt.ui from HEAD, likely caused by conversion of PasteAction to new ast rewrite:

public class X {
	int a= 1, b= a;
	
	int e= 1;
	int f= 2;
}

class Y {
	int y= 17;
}

- select fields a and b in the outline
- copy
- select y in the outline
- paste
=> order of inserted fields is wrong (a should be first)

=> same problem when copy-pasting e and f onto y.
