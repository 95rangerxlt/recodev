1. Hover the mouse over a method call in the JavaEditor
2. When the hover-help pops up note that it contains the method signature and
JavaDoc, but not the method's protection

The protection information is also useful to potential callers of that method
and should be reported with the signature.

hover is now in jdt.text.

what might be nice is if the hover window would contain the Java element image
that would show visibility, modifiers and type kind (enum, interface ect.)
We could show the image once whe use the Browser widget for hovers as well.

Side note: we now show Javadoc in the Browser widget where possible.
This feature is in 3.4.
