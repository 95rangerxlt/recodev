Version: 3.3.1
Build id: M20070905-1045

Steps:
- go to the Java perspective;
- click the new Java project button;
- in the wizard that pops up, select 'Use a project specific JRE' from the 'JRE' group;
- deploy the drop-down; on a brand new install, the list will only comprise the JRE used to start Eclipse itself; there appears to be no means to add a new JRE to the list from that part of the interface, seemingly compelling the user to leave the wizard, configure extra JREs as needed, then come back.

I know that 'Configure default' opens a dialog that enables the user to do just what is needed (create a new JRE *not changing the default at all though*), but this is far from guiding the user, especially if you consider that this link is aligned with 'Use default JRE', which is one of the option he has *not* chosen.

At least one other dialog makes this scenario easier (e.g. 'Run Dialog' which has an 'Installed JREs' aligned with 'Alternate JRE'). 

(Quite minor, but I thought it deserved a usability comment.)

We could rename 'Configure default' to 'Configure JREs'
Makes sense.
