Using I200412142000

Having the following class:
public class GenericClass<T> {
	private List<Integer> list;
}

Using "Encapsulate field" on list leads to:

public class GenericClass<T> {
	private List<Integer> list;

	/**
	 * @param list The list to set.
	 */private void setList(List<Integer> list){this.list=list;}

	/**
	 * @return Returns the list.
	 */private List<Integer> getList(){return list;}
}

1) Declaration of method should start on a new line (not the same as the javadoc
comment ends).
2) There is no line break after '{' and at the end of the declaration of a line.

This does not happen with fields which are not generic.

Sound like a AST Rewrite bug. There isn't anything special self encapsulate
field is doing here. The code that creates the methods is the same.
