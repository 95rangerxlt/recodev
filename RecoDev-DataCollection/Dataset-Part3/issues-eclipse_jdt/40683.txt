In M2 (3.0) if I enable the 'Enable lightbulb for quick assists' preference in 
the 'work in progress' preference page, the performance in the editor (typing 
specifically) degrades quite significantly.  It takes a couple of seconds when 
I hit 'Enter' to go to the next line, it takes a couple more seconds to type a 
single character.  If I turn this feature off, performance resumes normally.

I realize this is 'work in progress', so I put the severity as minor?
