Tom, this works for me in the following test case

package p;

import java.util.List;

public class Test2 {
    public void foo() {
        List<? super Number> nn= null;
    }
}

Search for List<? super Number> works with both Ctrl+Shift+G and Ctrl+H. Any
additional hints to reproduce ?
Created attachment 19354
Compare.java

source file showing the problem. Try Ctrl+H on any List<? super Number>
reference.
Tested with the latest and the attached source and it now finds 21 references in
the file to List<? super Number> were 3 are exact.

Marking as fixed.
