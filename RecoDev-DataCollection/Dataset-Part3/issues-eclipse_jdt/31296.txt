not sure what we can do here
We should think about improving the wording in the dialog. We have also to 
check if JDT/Core goes through validateEdit in this case. Adam, can you check 
with JDT/Core.
note to myself: it's very important that all checkboxes are unchecked
fixed
this was a pretty serious problem because it stopped checking preconditions if 
'update references' was unchecked

which resulted in _not_ calling validateEdit for files in the package etc. 
additional scenario to verify:

1.create a reference to the package in a read-only, non java file
2. uncheck the 'update references' checkbox
but select the
'update fully qualified references'
3. verify that it complains in this case too

i fixed 1 more bug in there - please retest different variants of settings of 
checkboxes (and read-onliess of referening files)
