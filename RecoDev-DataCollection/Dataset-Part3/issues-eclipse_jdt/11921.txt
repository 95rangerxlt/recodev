If you open the Java Type Hierarchy Perspective when you have a Java file open 
you get an empty Hierarchy View with the following message

Select a type (for example in the outliner), and use it's Open Type Hierarchy 
menu choice to display its Type Hierarchy here.

There is no Outline View in the Perspective be default or any otehr view that 
allows you to select a type.

Also the Outline View should not be called "outliner" as it is not referred to 
that anywhere else.
