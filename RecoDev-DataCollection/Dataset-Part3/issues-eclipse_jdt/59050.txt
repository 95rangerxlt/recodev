Using build I200404131323.

I was editing several files and haven't save them immediately when my eclipse 
hanged infinitely...

Looking at console, the exception seems to show that I was trying to open a 
popup-menu on a new created class, but I'm not completely sure that dead-lock 
occurred exactly at this moment.

I'll add complete console output including VM Dump Thread which identifies the 
dead-lock...

Set severity 'critical' as I have to cancel my eclipse session without saving 
and lost my modifications in modified editors...
