build 20030611

I was selecting lines in the Java editor using the keyboard (SHIFT+ARROW_DOWN)
when I got a NullPointerException in 
CompilationUnitDocumentProvider$CompilationUnitAnnotationModel.endReporting.

Same exception just happened again. Same scenario - selecting lines using the 
keyboard.
Did you use I20030618 when reporting the second case. Should have bin fixed in 
that build.
I was still using the 0611 build since the new build was reportedly bad.
