The source actions are inconsistent in repsect of visibility control:

- create constructor from superclass: no control
- add constructor using fields: no control
- generate setter/getter: you have control.

We should make this consistent. I opt to provide visibility control for all 
source actions.
agree that the for creating constructors visibility makes sense
