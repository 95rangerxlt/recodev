I did a model sync and wanted to override and update some changes. So I selected both java classes (not the files but the classes themselves) and right clicked -> most menu items (including override and update) were disabled. After some more clicking around, I tried selecting the classes again and, lo and behold, they were enabled. Something is amiss here.

Patch to JDT/UI plugin.xml

The problem is that the action provider of the Java Sync content provider has an enablement rule that differs from the content provider. This prevents the proper handler from being registered when the context menu is first shown. I have attached a patch that removes the enablement rule for the action provider which will result in the action provider using the same enablement as the content extension.
Tobias, could you review and apply this patch?
Reviewed and applied patch. Thanks!
