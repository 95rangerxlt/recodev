Create a full source workspace.
Edit xerces/plugin.properties
Save.
The build takes approximately 5 seconds as it builds each project dependent on 
xerces.
These are all nops.

Ran the test on another machine (without Novell client) and it was much faster 
(virtually instant).  

I would expect this to be fast anyway since this should just look at a (small) 
delta and determine that it is a nop.

Fixed.

We now know whether a prereq project was 'built' but didn't have any source 
folders so we can skip it.

Also fixed a problem with the lastStructuralBuildNumber optimization... it was 
possible with auto-build off to confuse prereq projects if you did a fulll 
build of a single project, then a minor incremental build, before propagating 
the changes to the dependents.
