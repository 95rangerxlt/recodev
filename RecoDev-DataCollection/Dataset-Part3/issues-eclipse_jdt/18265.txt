I usually turn off text hover help because the javadoc help gets annoying after 
awhile, always jumping in the way when you are trying to read code.

However, this also turns off the very useful error description hover help on 
text with errors.  While you can get the error text easely enough from the 
error marker in the left column, it would be nice if you still got it from the 
red underlined text.

I wonder that when people turn off text hover help, if its really just because 
of the javadoc help. 

If there already is a way of doing this sorry for the bug report, I didn't see 
it.

Actually, since you don't get an error task until you save, its not equivalent 
to the error hoverhelp which you get as you type.  Which means you lose out on 
something really handy if you turn off hover help text.
discussed with Kai and the toggle button behaviour in the toolbar could be 
change to only mean turn off Javadoc help.
Unplesant but not critical. Post 2.0.
Reopening for 2.1
Hover preferences are now available under Java>Editor>Hovers.
