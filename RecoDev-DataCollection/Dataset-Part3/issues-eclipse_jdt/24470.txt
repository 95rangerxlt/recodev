If you enter "new InterfaceName(" code assist will expand the interface as an
inner class. If you then do Undo, you are first taken to the imports section.
Another Undo gets you to the text and a third gets rid of the insertion. (This
is what I remember; Scott Stanchfield says you can do it in two undos.)

Code assist should be batching changes like Replace All does so they can always
be removed (the whole insertion, no more, no less) with a single undo.
