When typing in a method invokation, you can get into a situation where the 
closing bracket exists but the opening bracket doesn't. Typing the open bracker 
will automatically close it. Deleting the closing bracket will also delete the 
opening bracket. Heres a scenario to illustrate what happens

1) I end up with a method invokation that has no opening bracket (most likley 
due to mis-typing)

   printlnarg)

2) I place my opening bracket and end up with

   println()arg)

3) I remove the closing bracket I don't want the the opening bracket I added is 
also removed. I have to cut and past "arg" to get it to work. It seems that it 
should be possible to detect that there is a closing bracket ahead so that the 
auto-deletion can be disabled for this case.

We know the problem but don't have a better solution for now than 
differentating between Backspace and Delete. Backspace takes away both 
parentheses. Delete only removes the parenthesis right from the cursor.

Keep open for further investigation.

The bad state described in "2)" in the description no longer happens. Only a single open bracket is inserted.

And regarding case 1: you can either hit the Backspace key to delete "()" or the Delete key to only delete the ")".
