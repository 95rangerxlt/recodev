The current import order options (as accessed from Preferences -> Organize 
Imports) could be more flexible.

The solution I envisage would be to be able to place where unmatched imports 
go. Thus, an order could be defined like this:

java
javax
com
org
<other>
<my company>

Currently, the <other> is implicitly at the end of the import order, and can 
not be placed elsewhere.

Move to JDT/UI.
this got added in 3.2: Use '*' as entry name to create a griup that matches all unmatched.
