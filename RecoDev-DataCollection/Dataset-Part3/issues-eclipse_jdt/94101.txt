Tobias, the open package explorer warm tests only take a short period of time <
100ms. Those tests are candidates for false positive failures since they are
highly valunerable to little changes. I opt that we change this as follows:

- run the test in a loop for 10 times
- assert that opening the package explorer in a warm test takes less than
  500ms. From a user expierence it doesn't really matter if something takes 100
  or 200 ms.

I have made the changes in HEAD. If you agree, can you please backport them to
2.1.3 & 3.0.x

We do not show this test anymore
