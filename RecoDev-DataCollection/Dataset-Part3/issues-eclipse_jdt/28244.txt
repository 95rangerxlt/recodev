known problem
Dirk, there was some plan to improve this for single files refactorings
This is a know problem and there isn't much we can do as long as the platform 
doesn't provide a uniform undo story (not planned for 2.1). WE are 
investigating if we can improve the behavior for refactorings that only touch 
one file.
Improved behaviour so that multiple edits in open editors are folded into one 
Undo object. But we still have two undo stacks and this is something we can't 
change unless we get more support from the platform.
