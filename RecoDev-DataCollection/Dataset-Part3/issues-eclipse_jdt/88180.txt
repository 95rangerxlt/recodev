When I load a project with autobuild off the Auto Types Caching Thread shows up
even though I have building off. Is it neccessary to run this on any resource
change or can it just run when a build occurs?

Moving bug to JDT/UI.

To answer the question: yes, since the Java model is a source model you want to
see new classes even if you haven't compiled yet.

However, we try to get rid of the all types cache for 3.1
All types cache got removed for next integration build.
