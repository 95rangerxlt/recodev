specifying a illegal/nonexisting classname in the class attribute generates no error in the PDE editor nor does it generate any error/warn log in the runtime log if launched.

Making it quite hard to figure out why an enabled APT processor does not run anything.

We should log an error if a factory class is not found.
Problem is that in FactoryPathUtil.loadPluginFactories(), if we detect an exception while loading the factory, we do:

catch (CoreException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}

This needs to be an error log instead.  I thought we'd searched our code for e.printStackTrace()?  Guess not.
