I agree with all of you, this feature is REALLY usefull, but as it
is still available by F3 keyboard shortcut if the user doesn't want
to be disturbed while editing code and being bugged by links when
doing copy and paste Ctrl-C / Ctrl-V, it could be nice to give the
choice to the user to turn the link feature off or on.

I will make a feature request with this thread as description.

Regards,
Xavier

I fully agree with Scott Stanchfield here. This is a pretty nice
productivity feature which should be leaved in as an default and if some
user doesn't like to make use of it, he should have the ability to turn it
of via an preferences option.

BTW, on some other Java IDEs people are missing this feature a lot. A good
example might be JBuilder here, even in a slightly different hyperlinked
context. JBuilder once in former times for the JB3 IDE (...the native build
up one which was not based on pure Java...) had a similar feature for
looking up the javadocs related to such an selection. But they lost this
feature  over the time and nowadays people are wishing to have such a
feature again there.

Please make sure it's an option (don't kill it!) -- this is awesome for 
navigating through code to figure out what it does.
 
Now if I could just map that extra mouse button to the "back" action...

No, there is currently no preference to turn it off. Please file a feature
request (http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/ ).
and please describe why you want to turn it off, this might be useful
information for how to improve the feature.

Hi,
 
    Is it possible to turn the Hyperlinked code feature off ?
    I didn't find where... If not it could be nice to have the option
    to select this option in Java / Editor / Behavior panel. No ?

I would also like the ability to turn it off.  "Why?" was asked on the JDT-UI 
list, so here it goes:

In General:

- I tend to hold down Ctrl a lot, so I end up being surprised by the link-
ification of my code.
- I do a lot of Cut & Paste, which has the odd effect of linking what I C&P. 
- I find F3 more than enough for my jumping needs.

Bugginess:

- Links sometimes get "stuck" in the linked state, even after Ctrl is released
