code formatter has options like 'Insert new lines in control statements', and 
would also add a whitespace between 'catch' and '('

trick to do this would be to let the formatter first format a code like
try {
  x;
} catch (Exception e) {
}

and replace 'x;' by the user code
(as user code should not be reformatted)

Unclear if this will happen for 2.0 since for surround with try/catch it is 
hard to use the formatter since we don't want to reformat existing code. 

Lowered priority to P3.
But there's a trick how to avoid formatting existing code (See comment above)!
