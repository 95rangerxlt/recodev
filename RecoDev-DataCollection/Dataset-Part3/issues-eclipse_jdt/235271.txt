I checked Java > Editor > Content Assist, I could not find what you were saying on the Content Assist. But I found the proposals in the Advanced leaf of Content Assist.
Yes "Other Java Proposals" and "Other Java Proposals(Mylyn)" were observed when I checked off "Other Java Proposals" , it stopped showing the duplicates.

attached are images , which I captured.
thanks for the help.
