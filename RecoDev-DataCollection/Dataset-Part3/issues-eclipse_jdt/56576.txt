Quick outline: first member not selected when switching to inherited mode
- open type org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text
- press Ctrl+O
- type "getM" (-> list becomes empty)
- press Ctrl+O again
-> expected: "getMenu()" is selected in the background; Enter key should go to it
-> was: no item selected; Enter key does nothing

We do not select the first one but the enclosing Java element. If you filter
this will go away. Also, we keep the current selection when toggling.

This is still annoying. To reproduce in HEAD, type "getH" to make the list empty.

> We do not select the first one but the enclosing Java element.
That's the initial selection, but that's not the point of this bug.

> If you filter this will go away.
When I type some characters, then we select the closest matching element, so the selection does not go away unless there's no matching item.

> Also, we keep the current selection when toggling.
Yes, I'm only asking for a fix in the case nothing was selected before I toggled. It's strange that I have to type Backspace and then type the last character again to have the matching element selected.
Agree this time ;-)

Fixed in HEAD.
