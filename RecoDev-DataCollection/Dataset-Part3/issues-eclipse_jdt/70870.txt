I have the javadoc comment:

    /**
     * <p>
     * Seven-bit ASCII, also known as ISO646-US, also known as the Basic Latin
block of the Unicode character set.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support this
character encoding.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @see <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html#charenc">JRE
character
     *          encoding names </a>
     */

When I click on "JRE character encoding names" in the Javadoc view, I get a page
not found.

When I paste the URL:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html#charenc

in Mozilla, all is well.

Could you attach the entire class (or only your example) to the bug.
Bugzilla wrap lines and I need to know where the line really breaks in your code.
Thx
Forget my previous comment, I thought it was a compiler issue.
Move to JDT/UI who owns Javadoc view...
We replace the Class#member format with Class.member i.e. the '#' with a '.' and
this happpens for the link as well i.e. the link gets scrambled to
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html.charenc
which of course won't work.

JavaDoc2HTMLTextReader patch

Dani, here is a little patch to solve the problem. I'm not sure if this is the best way doing this but I think you could tell me more ;)
Perfect - and even with new tests. Thanks.

I some minor modifications:
- added your credentials to the header
- removed superfluous braces and spaces
- use 'result' instead of 'qualification' variable to store intermediate results
