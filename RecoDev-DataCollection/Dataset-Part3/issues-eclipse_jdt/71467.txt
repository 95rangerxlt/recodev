The JavaConventions.ValidatePackageName() does not return error under the

The package name starting with Capital letter + few characters + period + few 
characters + & + few characters.

The method always return warning instead of an ERROR.
Once you fix the first warning that says a package name should not start with an
uppercase letter, you get an error:
'sample&plugin' is not a valid Java identifier.
I think the right way to do it is to abort if an error is found, but continue
validation if a warning is found. With your test case, this would immediately
report an error instead of a warning and then an error when the warning case is
fixed. But if no error is found, then the warning would be returned.
The fix should be backported to 3.0.maintenance stream.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression tests added.
Backported to stream 3.0.maintenance.
Changed milestone to reflect fix backported in 3.0.1.
Verified for 3.0.1 RC1
