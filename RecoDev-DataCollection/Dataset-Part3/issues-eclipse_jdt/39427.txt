private String[] getNames()  {
	String[] names;

	return names;
}

I want the Quick fix in this case to know that I have compact assignment 
checked in Code Formatter->Style options and give me:\
String[] names= null;
instead of 
String[] names = null;

private String[] getNames()  {
	String[] names;

	return names;
}
