also open resource dialog. i'm assuming they all use common architecture
Open Type already does it in HEAD. Need to adapt Open Type Hierarchy as well when switching back to the FilteredItemsSelectionDialog.
I also joined to ask for a multiselect feature. This is what I miss most from the current version. Or, as an alternative, an editable select box for "Select a resource to open", with history items, and pressing down arrow would give back the previous search pattern.
Anyway Eclipse is the best and I can only thank its developers.
Fixed for Open Type.

Multiselection in the Open Type Hierarchy Dialog would need additional support from the Type Hierarchy View, see bug 145448.
