The 'Extract to local variable' quick assist currently replaces all occurrences. 
I'd like to have two separate quick assists for the 'Extract Local Variable' refactoring, namely:
- 'Extract to local variable' -- extracts only selected expression
- 'Extract to local variable (all occurrences)' -- current quick assist

Sorry Martin, I'm stealing this one from you, it's trivial to fix and a major pain point for me (extracting new GridData(...), new GridLayout(...))
