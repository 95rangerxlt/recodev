The progress reporting in extract interface is suboptimal. At the beginning
progress reporting is very slow then fast for 50% and then slow again.

Don't know if we can do anything but we should look at this in 3.2

Currently, we assign the same number of work steps for the four main tasks 
search, first pass, second pass, rewrite pass.

We could find a better partition for the common case.
Fixed in HEAD > 20051020
Test the following setup

- JUnit in source
- extract interface ITest from Test
- press preview

observe: now we have progress reporting for 25% and then the preview shows up.

May be the new tick provider helps optimizing this...

Problem is that ASTRequestor#accept does not take an IProgressMonitor. Since most work happens in this method, we cannot have good progress monitoring. Either we have a very rough estimation or a "stop" during this method.
I have improved the progress monitoring of Extract Interface, Extract Supertype, Use Supertype and Pull Up a little bit by giving better weights to subtasks. The problem mentioned in comment 4 however still exists.

Closing as fixed.
