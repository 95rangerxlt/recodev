Currently, structured selection shortcuts are defined as ALT-<arrowkey>. This 
is different then the other range selection shortcuts that use the SHIFT key. 
Structured selection shortcuts can be changed to use ALT-SHIFT-<arrowkey>, that 
would make them fit better with the rest of the text selection shortcuts.

Also, ALT-<arrowkey> shortcuts are frequently used for going back and forward 
in browsers and applications presenting similar functionality. These shortcuts 
would clash with similar functionality plugins may present in Eclipse (which my 
Nox Browser plugin at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nox does).

This change is fine by us, but checking with the Platform UI whether this is 
consistent with the overall short-cut scheme.
Where does this ALT+<arrowKey> shortcut occur?

If it's a Tree, this should not be necessary since there have been improvements 
in SWT to do this using Shift and Ctrl with the arrows.

I agree with Cagatay that we should reserve Alt+Left Arrow and Alt+Right Arrow 
for browser type navigation.

In general, Alt combinations should be avoided since they often clash with 
system functions or mnemonics, and these can differ on each platform.

Shift+<arrows> is usually used for extending a continuous selection.
Ctrl+<arrows> is usually used for changing focus item, with Ctrl+Space toggling 
selection of the item with focus.
In the case of single selection, Ctrl+<arrows> is often used for panning 
without changing the selection.

Moving back to JDT.
