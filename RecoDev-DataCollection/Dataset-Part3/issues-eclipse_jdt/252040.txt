Consider the following snippet:
---------------------------------
package p;

public class A {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		switch(getSomethingWithSideEffects()) {
		case 1:
			break;
		case 2:
			break;
		default:
		}
	}

	private static int getSomethingWithSideEffects() {
		System.out.println("side effect");
		return 2;
	}
}
-----------------------

After applying the "Convert switch to If" quick assist it leads to different semantics as the method with sideeffects is called twice instead of once.
I think this could be handled by assigned the method result to a new local var which is then used in the if/else expressions.

Fix is simple enough.

When dealing with statements, you always have to check ASTNodes.isControlStatementBody() or use StatementRewrite to deal with the case where the statement is not inside a block.

IAE in master:

		if (true)
			switch (System.getProperty("file.separator")) {
			case "\r\n":
				System.out.println("win");
				break;
			case "\n":
				System.out.println("unix");
				break;
			}

Thanks for checking!

Is the local var only extracted for a method call? I wouldn't see a need for extraction if the switch() is already on a local variable or field.

yup, extraction does not happen if the switch expression is already a local variable or a field.
