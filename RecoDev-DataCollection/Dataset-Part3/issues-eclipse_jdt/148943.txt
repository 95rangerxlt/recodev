JDT UI from HEAD as of now

Add the 3.8.1 JUnit JAR to the build path and look at the icons: they have no label.

This is caused by the hack for bug 148657. The new code probably misses and IPath.isEmpty() check
add a test if path is not empty > 20060628

Note that I filed bug 148944 to come up with a better solution: Flat list rendering isn't good.
