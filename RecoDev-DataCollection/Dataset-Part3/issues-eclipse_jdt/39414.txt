can you provide a simple test case that i could verify against?

Eh.

It appears pull up does add import statements, but not in all cases.

I haven't reduced it yet.



public class Foo
{

}
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Bar extends Foo
{
	public void xxx()
	{
		new LinkedList();
	}
}

OK, got it.

- Pull up silly() 
- navigate back and add "xxx"
- Complete pull up

-> missing import statement in Bar.java

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class Bar extends Foo
{

	protected List xxx = new LinkedList();

	protected void silly()
	{
		xxx.get(0);
	}
}

public class Foo
{

}


might not have time to look at before m3
fixed - a cache was not flushed properly
