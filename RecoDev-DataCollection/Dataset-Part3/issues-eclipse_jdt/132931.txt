Given the method:

	private void test(Collection c) {
		for (Object o : c) 
			System.out.println(o.toString());
	}

If you attempt to extract "o.toString()" as a local variable, it is placed outside the for loop.

The refactoring should create braces for the for loop and place the local variable inside.
