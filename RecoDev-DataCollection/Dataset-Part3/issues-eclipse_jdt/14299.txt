Hello,
I would suggest the following useful feature ; could it be possible to add a 
filter in the package view of the java browsing perspective, and elsewhere in 
order to aneble the user to filter 
the "package", "protected", "private", "public" classes of a package or a group 
of packages. Actually we often need to have in a glance all public classes  of 
a package or a group of packages.... It corresponds to the interface of a an 
application towards the external world. Nobody in other tools implements this 
feature , except maybe in modeling tools like STOOD(a implementation tool of 
the HOOD method or the UML tools).
Best regards
Xavier

This filter is very expensive since it requires to parse the contents of all 
Compilation Units. 

Not doable for 2.0
I think that it is doable in a simplified version at first for instance in the 
Type view of the java browsing perspective, since we already know in which 
package we are. We have only to add in this first version the filter in the 
head of the type view.

Added this to the Types view since it can be done in a non-expensive way.
If you think this is a must in other components then please file a bug per
component (components belong to different owners and having a bug for each
simplifies to track it).

Fixed.
