build i0202

Here is a test case in which you lose your method comments after you perform the
refactoring. I noticed it because I have my compiler options set to ERROR when I
have a non-NLS'd string so after the refactoring I had compiler errors.

In the code below, select the #bar method and choose Inline.

-------------


package aaa;

public class A {
	
	String bar(String message) {
		return message;
	}
	
	void foo() {
		System.out.println(bar("This is a ")  //$NON-NLS-1$
			+ bar(" message")); //$NON-NLS-1$
	}

}
