I'd like to filter out packages/classes from content assist that I won't ever 
select.

When working with SWT, I find I frequently accidentally select the java.awt 
homonym, e.g. Button, FlowLayout.  This also happens when selecting List (java.
awt.List is at the top of the list).

you can already do that on the Java -> Appearance -> Type Filter page

Yes, you can already do that _but_ you have to know that the Type Filter page exists and where it is or that typing 'Filter' in the Preferences search tool will find the page AND you need to know that the Type Filter page is where this filtering is configured.  There is _nothing_ in the Content Assist page that indicates the possibility of filtering.  The only way to find out is to look at the help (and search for "Content Assist" - not just navigate to the "Content Assist" section).

This proposed enhancement is about making it easier to configure "Content Assist".

An alternative is to add the "Type Filter" page when "Content Assist" is typed into the Preferences search tool.

Please consider reopening this entry.
I rename the request to improve the preference page.
One possibility is to add a link from the code assist preference page to type filters.
Added a link and a preference page keyword to find the Type Filter page when entering "content assist".
