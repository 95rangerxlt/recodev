Hi,

class C1 {
  class C2 {}
}

class C3 extends C1 {
  C2 test = new C2();
}

after using OrganizeImports i get the line
  import C1.C2
in my C3.java

The import isn't needed, although it doesn't break anything.

BTW: The compilers outputs a warning again for the import because it isn't
needed. (C3 is looked up in the scope of C2/C1 i guess)
