It would be nice to have a quick fix for unused import warnings which simply 
removes the import.
Actually, it's already there in the editor, but not in the Tasks view.

It's nice that it supports Organize Imports as a resolution too.
Martin, do we have to do anything special that this shows up in the task view
All quick fixes in the editor also are available on in the task list.
I just tried that and it was there. There were some action enablement problems 
(bug 28655).
There is a restriction on our side that we only give the list when the file is 
open in the editor. I wanted to have a look at this for RC1 (we would have to 
open the editor first)

Can you confirm that was the problem?
quick fix on the task list now also works when the corresponding CU is closed
