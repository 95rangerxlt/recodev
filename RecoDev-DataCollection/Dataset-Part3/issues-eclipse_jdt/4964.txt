Build 204

While writing SWT code, I type the following:

   button.dispose

At this point, I do not realize that the code assist list is up because I am 
not looking. There are 2 items in the list now:
   DISPOSED   int - Widget
   dispose()  void - Widget

I then type "(" because the line I was typing was supposed to be:

   button.dispose();

But as soon as I type the "(" then automatic code assist seems to insert 
whatever is selected. Since DISPOSED is first in the list and is selected, I 
ended up with:

   button.DISPOSED

which isn't even close to what I want, and I have to delete it all and start 
again, paying more attention this time.

Code assist should notice that I have typed a ( and that this matches "dispose
()" far better than "DISPOSED".  Either that, or it needs to be case sensitive 
when it is automatically inserting stuff.

Although content assist is not case sensitive, the described scenario will no 
longer happen. Build 20011218.
