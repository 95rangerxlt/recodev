This is a case where the collection type of a foreach statement is null.
It would be nice if you could tell us how you used the foreach statement in your code.
Do you have compile errors ?

Since the Interface extraction is not using the binding recovery, I would say it has to handle null cases for bindings.
Moving to JDT/UI.
Markus, please take a look.
Fixed in HEAD.

Test case (method getCollection() is undefined):

public class Test {
    public void m() {
        for (Test t : getCollection()) {
            t.abc();
        }
        for (Test t : getCollection()) {

        }
    }

    private void abc() {
    }
}
