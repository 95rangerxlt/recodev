This is on 3.0M5. When I want to create a new file directly in a package, the 
wizard window won't select the associated directory. In fact, all the fields of 
the window are blank.

On previous version, when doing the explained action, the directory of the 
selected package would automatically be selected in the "New File" window.

This got fixed for M6. Was caused by RCP work which got introduced for M5.
