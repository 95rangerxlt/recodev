Labels of the container nodes in the preview page of the Rename refactoring are
a constant string: "update method references" or "update method reference"

This is bad - it should show the name of the CU like in the type refactoring.
Furthermore it should name declarations changes as such and not as reference
changes.

i think this is fixed now - will check
fixed
The preview still shows the change of the method declaration as 'Update method 
occurence', which is the same text used for method references to update.
Is this intentional?
not very fortunate but will be lived with for now
