I was trying to move to compilation units from one project to another in the 
Java Browsing perspective. I selected them in the types brwoser and selected 
Cut. I then tried to Paste them in another package by selecting the target 
package in the packages view but paste wasn't enabled. I tried to paste them in 
the navigator and was told that the resource no longer existed. 

After restoring the files from local history, I chose Copy instead and Pasted 
into the new package. I had two entries for each file pasted.

works in the straightforward scenario:
1) Java browsing perspective
2) select the type junit.framework.Assert
3) cut
4) select junit.extensions
5) paste
->the cu is properly moved.

Can you reproduce it? Do you have more background on what you did.
nope, this will not work now (Erich did copy/paste by mistake)

there's no way now - after the file is deleted i cannot paste it somewhere else.
(the plaform just does not have any story for such a case.)

so - the solution for now will be: i will disable cutting of top level types

you will still be able to move them by:
1. drag and drop or
2. move element... from the context menu or
3. copy/paste/delete (as opposed to copy/delete/paste to which cut/paste is 
really expanded)



done
Verified.
