(this happens to me *all the time* and is quite frustrating)

i have this:
int foo(){
	return 10;
}

void bar(){
	foo();
}

i want to assign foo to something, so i use quick assist on the call to foo()
and end up with
int i= foo(); 
ok, 'i' is in the linked mode

now, i like the name and just want to leave the linked mode
i press 'tab', like in templates

boom! the name is gone and the tab is actually inserted!
the only solution i found is to press 'end', which is very ugly 

(i don't know if this is a quick assist problem or editor problem)

Martin, can you please comment.
You're not in linked mode at this time. Do you think we should?
it definitely feels like linked mode
and the gut feeling (became a buzzword these days :-)) is that hitting Tab
will put me into the state in which i want to be

so yes, i think we should (even though there's only 1 thing linked in this case)
I agree, since it would end up in a more consistent user interface.
Martin, any objections to enter linked mode in this scenario.
I would like to use the linked mode for most of the quick fixes.
