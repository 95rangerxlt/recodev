M5:

- create class Bar with this code:
public class Bar {
	void foo() {
		int i= 1;
		if (i == 2) {
			i= 1;
		}
		i= 2;
	}
}
- select full line "i= 2" and cut to clipboard
- paste line inside if-statement
Observe: the closing bracket is indented
public class Bar {
	void foo() {
		int i= 1;
		if (i == 2) {
			i= 1;
			i= 2;
			}
	}
}

I am not sure weather Bug 47695 is a duplicate. This bug relates to close 
brackets and the other relates to open brackets! I would recommend you add unit 
tests for both examples given.
The same happens when copying and pasting the mentioned line and the next one
(with the closing brace).
*** Bug 47893 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Working on this, should be ready this week. Note that you can get rid of the
problem by disabling Java->Editor->Typing->"Paste for smart indentation"
