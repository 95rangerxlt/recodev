One of the testers had a question in regards to the documentation:

In the following file:

eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user\whatsNew\jdt_whatsnew.html

Action to enable and disable link with selection.

The "with selection" is not easy to understand.

Can we interpret this sentence as:"Action, through selecting which to enable and disable link."?

Thnaks in advance!

No. The action enables (or disables) linking with selection i.e. whether the view gets updated upon selection changes in the workbench.

I've updated the sentence to:
<li>Action to enable and disable linking with selection.</li>
