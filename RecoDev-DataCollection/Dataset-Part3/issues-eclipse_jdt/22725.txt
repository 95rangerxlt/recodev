It would be nice if the "Externalize Strings" wizard filled in the "Enter 
common prefix for generated keys" field with the name of the name of the class 
by default.

For example, if I'm externalizing the strings in JDIModelPresentation, the 
prefix would be set to "JDIModelPresentation." by default. I believe this is 
what most users do anyway, so it would be nice if the tool did it for us.

Good suggestion.
