Build 20011127 + latest JDTCORE (v_216b)

Turn off autobuild, then define the following project (src & src2 are source 
folders):

Project P
  +- src
       +- pack
          +- X.java [package pack; class X{} ]
  +- src2
       +- p1
          +- X.java [package p1; class X{}]
       +- p2
          +- Y.java [package p2; class Y extends p1.X {}]
       +- p3
          +- Z.java [package p3; class Z extends p2.Y {}]

FULL BUILD

Now discard both at once: P/src/pack/X.java and P/src2/p3 (folder is discarded 
with content).

INCREMENTAL BUILD

Both p1/X.java and p2/Y.java got recompiled (?) and tagged with problems since 
their package statement was thought to be incorrect.

Fixed... was caused by src being a prefix for src2.
