I find this template useful. It seems generic enough that it could be included
with the default set of templates.

Template name: for
Template description: iterator over a range of integers
Template body:

for (int ${index} = ${start}; ${index} < ${end}; ${index}++) {
    ${cursor}
}

We have to think about other for templates as well. For example iterate over 
array from end to beginning.
Reopening...
for templates have been added a while ago
