I'm using the eclipse 2.1.0 release.  My JDK is set to the J2SDK 1.4.1.

I found a specific case where Organize Imports adds imports that are immediately
flagged with a warning to show that they are never used.

- Create a new project.
- Create the following types in A.java, B.java and C.java respectively:
- Open C.java and Organize Imports.

public interface A {
    interface X { }
}

public class B implements A {
   void foo() { X x; }
}

public class C extends B {
   void foo() { X x; }
}

Result: An unused import of A.X is generated.  (And A.X is even in the same 
package as C!  oops :)

If you open B.java and Organize Imports, no import is generated.

Martin, please comment.
its a bug. the type wizard does not create an AST so it does not know about the
visibility.
