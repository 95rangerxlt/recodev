- use PDE plug-in container for reference plug-ins
- org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor in source
- open AbstractTextEditor, go to a reference to ErrorDialog
- press Ctrl+H, search for references to type ErrorDialog, scope set to project

-> Observe: I get Matches for the org.eclipse.jface project because it is
referenced from within the PDE plug-in container.

-> Expected: referenced libraries are not searched.

We need to handle scopes for JRE, PDE Cotainer, Referenced projects and user
libraries. Since we don't know PDE in JDT, we have to find a general way to
handle classpath containers. This is an architectural issue and should be
adressed early.

I am adding my comment to this bug because the original 68822 was marked as a 
duplicate of this one. ( through 57752 )

The original problem in 68822 described the behaviour of searching 
for "Implementors" using a working set.   I selected this action from the 
outline view.  If I select "References..." or "Declarations..." from the same 
popup menu and apply a working set I appear to get the expected results.  In 
both cases the Search view where the results are displayed shows "...in 
Working Set - <working set>" in the title bar.

But when I do the same thing with "Implementors..." with a working set the 
Search view shows "... in Workspace" in the title bar.

I might be missing the real problem but on the surface it sure looks like the 
search for Implementors is not applying the working set in the same way that 
Declarations and References does as indicated by the title bar in the Search 
view.
not for 3.1
This got fixed in 3.4 M7 (together with bug 171988)
