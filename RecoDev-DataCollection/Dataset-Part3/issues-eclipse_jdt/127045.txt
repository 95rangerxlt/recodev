TypeInfoUtil.searchTypeInfo performs a search just to get a type info. This is too expensive and unnecessary.

Either change the history to store qualified names
or allow to create a type info from a qualified name (problem is the enclosing type names, so either we cheat there, or we need also the package name to evaluate the enclosing type names)
