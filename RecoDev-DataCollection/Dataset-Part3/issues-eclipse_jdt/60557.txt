The current implementation of InlineAction#run(ITextSelection) is rather
expensive. If you set the caret to a method call and run Refactor > Inline, the
same AST (with bindings) is created 4 times: 3 times for each try... method and
a last time when the refactoring is finally executed.

The problem is that we don't pass the AST around.

Got addressed by Tobias.
Not really fixed. The same AST is still created twice.
Fixed in HEAD.

Not a single AST is created any more, since RefactoringASTParser.parseWithASTProvider(..) takes the AST from the editor's cache.
