Create a new class, check the "public static void main(String[] args)" checkbox
in the wizard. Put the cursor after the method declaration, hit enter.  The
cursor is now inside the method, on a blank line, tabbed to the right of the
method declaration.  Now type "for", hit Ctrl-space, and select "for - iterate
over a collation".  Hit tab until the temporary variable inside the for loop is
highlighted (it should be named "element").  Hit the right arrow button to move
the cursor to the end of "element" and de-select "element".  Now hit the
"delete" key.  Notice that the green template line shortens by one character.
