Updating a classpath variable from the project's Java Build Path does not
reflect a change as expected.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Project Properties page, and choose Java Build Path.
2. Select the Libraries tab, and click "Add Variable".
3. Note the list of variables shown, and click "Configure Variables". The
Classpath Variables dialog is shown.
4. Edit the value of an existing variable for a folder path.  Note that the
updated value now appears on the Classpath Variables dialog.
5. Click OK.  Eclipse will ask you if you want to do a full rebuild.  Say "Yes".
6. You are returned to the "Add Variable" dialog.  Note that the old values for
the variables still appear.  Any attempt to "Extend" the changed variable will
result in an incorrect path.
7. Close the Variable Extension dialog. Close the "Add Variable" dialog.
8. Click "Add Variable" button again from the Project Properties screen.
9. Note that the new value for the variable is now correctly displayed.

This is frustrating since it often means that after editing a variable value,
one gets almost to the point of using it only to discover that a good portion of
the process now has to be scraped and repeated.  Having the new variable values
reflected in the list after "Configure Variables" has been clicked would be
really helpful.

Tim, which build are you using ?
I'm using 3.1 RC2.  The Help | About shows I20050610-1757.  Thanks.
Tim, I tried to reproduce this using N20050616-0010 but wasn't able to do so.
When I edit a folder variable using the configure dialog the value is updated in
the "Add Variable" dialog. Anything special you are doing ?


Didn't intend to close as works for me
Hmm.  I downloaded N20050616-0010 and reproduced it.  I may be doing something
strange, so I made a quick screencast of it.  It's 200 KB, and it's a Windows
Media file.  Let me know if you need a different format and I can try to convert
to Quicktime or MPEG.  I'll delete it from that URL once the bug is closed or
resolved.

This looks like a timing issues then since in my examples the dialog is refresh
correctly. Needs some further investigation.
Actually the update of the variable is done together with the build which
happens in a Job. Hence the timing issue. Changing this for 3.1 is too risky. As
to wait > 3.1.

The "work around" is to change the variable through Preferences dialog directly. 

Tim, thanks for the nice screencast
