Build 20020519

I've found a couple icon problems in this build.

1. The Java Perspective icon shown in the "Open Perspective" dialog and in the 
toolbar on the left is grayed. It should be white.
2. The Packages View icon has white garbage around the package image. The 
background should be transparent.
