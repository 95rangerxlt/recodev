When ONLY the opening brace of a control block is out of alignnment, and I try 
to use tab to fix it, 3 spaces are added instead of 2. Note that I am using 
spaces instead of tabs, and my indents are set to 2 spaces.

For example, in eclipse if you enter the following code in an editor window:

public class Foo
{
  public Foo()
  {
    if ( true )
  {
        
    }
  }
}

If I move to the line immediately after the line 'if ( true )' and hit tab, 
this is what results:

public class Foo
{
  public Foo()
  {
    if ( true )
     {
        
    }
  }
}

When multiple lines are selected (even just the opening brace and the blank 
line after it), everything works fine.

Works for me on HEAD.

What build are you using? This has probably to do with the smart tab using TAB
characters instead of spaces, see bug 47695, which has been fixed > 20031128.

Closing, please reopen if you still see this.
what is 'HEAD' ?

This bug occured in eclipse 3.0 M5

I don't think tab characters are being added... When I place the cursor at the 
beginning of the extra space and press the backspace key, only one space is 
removed.

Perhaps I should wait and see if the bug still exists in 3.0 M6
HEAD is the current development stream, which admittedly won't you help you
much. You can try this weeks integration build (I20031203 or so) if you want to
verify the fix.

Not only the TAB issue got fixed, but the auto-indenter also respects your
setting for the number of spaces that represent one indentation level.
