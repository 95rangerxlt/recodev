The build starts before the Java UI plugin is activated and the class path 
initialized. Workaround is to rebuild again.
This is what happens:
(code in org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.projects)
- A project is created with natures specified in the plugin.xml (->includes jdt 
nature)
- Project content, including the .classpath file is imported (all in a 
workspacerunnable)
- This overwrite the existing classpath file. As the bug describes, the build 
triggered by the import a rebuild does not use the new .classpath file.
- Rebuild: Errors are gone

moving to jdt.core

The change of .classpath should retrigger the build.

It is critical since this is part of the getting started experience.

This is our well-known defect with unitialized classpath variables.
Fixed by introducing classpath variable initializers (also see bug 3303).
