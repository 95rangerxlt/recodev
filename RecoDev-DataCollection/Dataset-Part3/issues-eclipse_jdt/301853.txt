We intend to re-use the detail pane editors in the properties dialog. So, this will be cleaned up.
Fixed with bug 300615. The property pages re-use the detail pane editors. Please verify, Dani.
Looks good except that the widget tab sequence is very strange: it jumps from 'Enabled' to 'Suspend VM'. Filed bug 302133.
