Moving to jdt for review. I guess that JavaDebugHover.getHoverInfo2 should handle null more gracefully?

Nope. One should investigate why frame.getThis() returns 'null'.

StackFrame is spec'd to return the null reference (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jpda/jdwp/jdwp-protocol.html#JDWP_StackFrame) and our code respects that:

IJavaObject receiver = null;
 if (!isStatic()) {
  ObjectReference thisObject = getUnderlyingThisObject();
  if (thisObject != null) {				
   receiver = (IJavaObject)     
   JDIValue.createValue((JDIDebugTarget) getDebugTarget(), thisObject);
  }
}
return receiver;

we should be checking for null where getThis() is called. The isStatic check should also be updated with a call to isNative(). We should also update the check in JavaDebugHover to include frame.isNative() (~line 335 in getHoverInfo2).

Mike, 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.actions.OpenReceivingTypeAction.getTypeToOpen(IDebugElement)
Also has a isStatic check, should that be replaced with isNative along with is null check for getThis ?

We should not replace the call, by 'update' I meant 'also include the call the isNative()' like:

if(!isStatic() && !isNative()) {
  ObjectReference thisObject = getUnderlyingThisObject();
<snip>

For org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.actions.OpenReceivingTypeAction I would do something like:

if (frame.isStatic()) {
  return frame.getReferenceType();
}
IJavaObject ths = frame.getThis();
if(ths != null) {
  return ths.getJavaType();
}
<snip>
Created attachment 249730
Handle null for Stackframe getThis()

Added not null check for getThis() and updated checks with isNative()
Pushed fix to: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=3867f7d4481335da425e2a62cbd7e806dbc0dd9f

I made a small change in the patch to not successively call #getThis() on stackframes, the reason being that each call could result in another VM request being sent.

For example changed patterns like:

if (frame.getThis() != null) {
  variables = frame.getThis().getVariables();

to

IJavaObject ths = frame.getThis();
if (ths != null) {
  variables = ths.getVariables();
