The "Open Type" is one of the most usefull features in Eclipse, but it applies
only to Java types.
Can something similar to be done for any file that can be found in work space.
This could be a very usefull feature, for anybody who have a large number of
file in the workspace (in my case we are talking about more that 30k number).

Thank You
