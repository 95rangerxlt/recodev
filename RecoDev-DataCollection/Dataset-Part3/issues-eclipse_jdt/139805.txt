This is also an issue for the Hovers, Templates and Typing sub pages
I just checked and all elements from these pages are accessible once the page is resized.
I just checked with the dialog maximized and I can vewrify that all you lose is a border at the bottom of a list
*** Bug 139534 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Per my request in the spr that is a duplicate of this one; is there any documentation that states Eclipse only supports High contrast mode in 1152X768? I will need a link to this information for our products readme file.

Thank you. 

I haved logged Bug 139829 for this.
After looking at Preferences in high contrast mode with 1152x864, I am finding
that items are still cut off in Java/Debug even after resizing the dialog. This
includes the 1st two items under debug, detail and logical
It also looks like items in the Appearance color options for Editor are cut
off. 

Editor Context Assist has a scroll bar come up for the window when the items go
off the screen. Can this be done for all items in preferences, so it won't
matter what size you window is?
Scrollbars only work if someone has written thier page to handle scrolling - otherwise it is pretty easy to end up with a small little page in the top corner when you do have the space. Doing it by default would break a lot of layouts.

Please file a separate bug against JDT Debug. This bug already contains more than one problem - which is bad: each problem should be reported in its own bug.
JDT team, this bug is targetted for 3.3 - will this be fixed in the 3.3 timeframe?  The reason I ask is there have been no comments for six months on this one.
This is time permitting for 3.3 as it is really minor - see comment 4.
Fixed in HEAD.
