In R3.0, given:

package my.pack;

class Foo {
<<CARET>>
void foobar(){}
}

Paste:

/**
 * comment
 */

If the formatting preferences have "Declarations withing class bodies" 
disabled, the text should be pasted *as is*.  Instead, it is always indented, 
even though the method declaration just below is not indented.

This only occurs on the first member of a class.  It works when pasting AFTER a 
member which is unindented.

also related: pressing <Return> after "class Foo {" indents.

This appears fixed in 3.1-RC1
