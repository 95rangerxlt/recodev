The alignment of text when "else if on the next line" is set to false is very
inaccurate.

If you re-format the code it is fine (i.e. right click and select re-format) but
as you are typing the code gets progressively more out of alignment. This
happens to such an extent that you sometimes wonder if you've got too many
spaces. It makes coding very annoying because things eventually don't line up at
all.

I have attached a gif that illustrates it slightly out of alignment. If you keep
typing it gets much worse. Notice the the "if" and "else" lines are not aligned
with the lines above.
It's hard to decide the priority of this but I've had to stop using Eclipse
temporarily because it is so irritating.

I'm using JDK 1.3.1. I've tried this on NT 4 and 2000. I'm using the Eclipse
build 20011107.

Code window snippet showing bad alignment
Works for me using fixed and propoertional fonts

Build 20011219
The problem still exists. Here are some simple steps to reproduce:

- create a class
- insert a method like
    public void g() {
    }
- remove the tab before public void ... and }
- insert 4 space instead
- the line public void is more indented than the line }
