If you select a piece of code, right click -> source -> comment you can not undo
that action.  Probably a problem with other context menu commands.

the same is true if you use the keyboard command for comments CTRL+/
the commenting-steps are not part of the undo list. All steps
before or after commenting-setps are in the list and are properly undone.
one more comment. the uncomment function (CTRL+\) 
is properly undone with CTRL-Z.
After installing RC2 (Version: 2.1.0 - Build id: 200303071024)
this bug ceased to exist.

If I could I would close it now. Thanks!
Verify.  This now works.
