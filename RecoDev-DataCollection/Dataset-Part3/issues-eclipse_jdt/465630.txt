When Show Skipped Tests Only (bug 298603) is enabled in the JUnit view, the "Next/Previous Failed Test" buttons don't work any more. They are enabled if the test run session had errors, and they are disabled if all non-skipped tests are green.

They at least need to be disabled when they don't work. A better solution would be to change them to "Next/Previous Skipped Test" in that case.

Attached patch disables the "Next/Previous Failed Test" buttons when "Show Skipped Tests Only" filter is applied.

The buttons can be changed to "Next/Previous Skipped Test" buttons in a separate patch later.

Markus, please have a look.
Looks good, and I trust you that it works. Please commit.
