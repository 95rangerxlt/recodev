Build 200209031019

In the outline view, the current decorator for a method which implements an
abstract method defined in a abstract class is the full triangle, as for a
method which overrides an other method.
The decorator should be the empty triangle, as for methods which implement other
abstract methods (interface methods). Because, as for these methods, it's really
an implementation, not an overriding of an other method.

Martin, any reason why we render it in the described scenario as 
an "implements" ?
