1) enable semantic highlighting
2) enable deprecated highlighting
  -> the default color is black and no default style
There should be a reasonable default style.
My first choice would be strikethrough which we currently cannot do.
Some dark yellow for "warning" would be my second choice

To me this is a case where I would like to change only the color and keep the
same style otherwise (bold or italic). This is currently not supported. I
suggest to use bold for now.
