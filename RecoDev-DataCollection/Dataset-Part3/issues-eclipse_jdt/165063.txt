Hi,

My plugin uses the extension point org.eclipse.core.resources.modelProviders to provider a model provider that Eclipse will call.  That is, eclipse call my model provider's method 'public IStatus validateChange(IResourceDelta delta, IProgressMonitor monitor)'.  My validateChange(...) return an IStatus of IStatus.WARNING that causes Eclipse to put up a warning (Yes/No) dialog.  This dialog is display by the method IDE.promptToConfirm(...).  Upon clicking on "Yes", there is another confirmation dialog displayed.

There should only be one? no?

For what kind of changes are you seeing multiple validations? Any resource change, or only particular changes?  Do you get two identical confirmation dialogs, or different ones?
I managed to reproduce the issue on 3.4M4. However it looks like instead of two dialogs we have one now, but with a multiple of the same status.

The steps are:
1) Plug-in a validator returning WARNING status always
2) Launch Eclipse with the validator
3) Create Java project and try to copy a class between packages

The result is:
a dialog with two the same statuses (See the attached picture)

Multiple status in the dialog
It seems that the issue is in ProcessorBasedRefactoring class.

A plug-in with the model provider

This provider I used to reproduce the issue.

it as a problem with the Java copy refactoring. Please speak up if the scenario from comment 3 isn't the bug you see.
