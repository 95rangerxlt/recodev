Hello I can't seem to be able to update my eclipse ADT plugin via the update menu item and when I try putting in the update web site manually it produced an error of internal memory overload. How can this be resolved.

I discovered that I had conflicts in my plug-ins perhaps meaning that I duplicates. So I eliminated the duplicates and was able to update the ADT plug-in.
