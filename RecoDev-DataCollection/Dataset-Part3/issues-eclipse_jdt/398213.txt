Bug 381443 introduces a new option constant in JavaCore and a new command line option. Both need documenting.

I guess this isn't going in yet for RC1. Resetting to 4.3.
Stephan, time's running out.
I should have done this earlier, my apologies.

Here's a list of option constants in JavaCore introduced since Juno:
(1) null analysis:
    COMPILER_INHERIT_NULL_ANNOTATIONS
    COMPILER_PB_NONNULL_PARAMETER_ANNOTATION_DROPPED
    COMPILER_PB_SYNTACTIC_NULL_ANALYSIS_FOR_FIELDS
(2) other:
    COMPILER_PB_UNUSED_TYPE_PARAMETER

Changes regarding CLI options in class Main (new since Juno):
(3) fix for bug 375366
(4) bug 375409 (see list at bug 375409 comment 18)
(5) inheritNullAnnot, nonnullNotRepeated
(6) unusedTypeParameter, unusedTypeArgs


This is where we stand regarding documentation updates for these:
(1) planned via this bug
(2) via bug 391643
(3) via bug 375366 comment 12
(4) via bug 375409 comment 18
(5) planned via this bug
(6) via bug 353238

Furthermore this comparison reveals: I forgot to add a CLI token for
COMPILER_PB_SYNTACTIC_NULL_ANALYSIS_FOR_FIELDS

I just filed bug 408815 for this.
Correction:

That bug only covered unusedTypeArgs.
unusedTypeParameter should be handled via bug 391643 -> reopened.
Even less to be done: documentation for inheritNullAnnot and 
COMPILER_INHERIT_NULL_ANNOTATIONS was already present via bug 388281.


On the positive side I'm preparing the following changes:

jdt_api_options.htm
- COMPILER_PB_NONNULL_PARAMETER_ANNOTATION_DROPPED
- COMPILER_PB_SYNTACTIC_NULL_ANALYSIS_FOR_FIELDS

ref-preferences-errors-warnings.htm
- cross linked with other sections

task-using_batch_compiler.htm
- nonnullNotRepeated

task-using_null_annotations.htm
- Section "Relaxing a @NonNull parameter to unspecified?"
- Section "The case of fields"


The latter section contains a paragraph intended to avoid undue expectations 
by users.
===>>> Comments to this part are particularly welcomed.
