This is blocking Bug 90257 which we were hoping to have cleared up for M5 (we have marked it for M6 now). The support is in - we just
can't delete the internal code until the apt plug-in removes the internal
dependency.
Fixed.  Sorry for the delay.
Thanks Walter. Let me know when it is in a build and then we can proceed too.
