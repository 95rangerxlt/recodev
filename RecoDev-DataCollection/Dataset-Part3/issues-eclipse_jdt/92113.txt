The Undo/Redo facility of the Java text editor no longer operates after a file
is closed implicitly due to having too many open. This problem started occuring
in 3.1M6.

To reproduce: go into the preferences --> General --> Editors and set the max
number of files to be opened to 2.

Then bring up a Java file into the editor; make a modification and then save it,
but don't close it. Bring up a second file and do the same. Then bring up a
third file. Notice that the first file closes implicitly. Then make changes in
the third file. You'll notice that "undo" no longer works.
