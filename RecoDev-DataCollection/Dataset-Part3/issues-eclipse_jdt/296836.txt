The following 2 static variables have been removed from the JDT. Unfortunately, this is breaking our compatibility between Eclipse 3.4 and 3.6. 

I would appreciate if we could bring them back:

org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.ActionMessages.OrganizeImportsAction_summary_added
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.ActionMessages.OrganizeImportsAction_summary_removed

Thanks,

This is not a major bug in Eclipse but in your product. Anyway, we'll bring those back for you but make sure that in future releases of your product you fix the usages of *.internal.* code.
Fixed in HEAD.
