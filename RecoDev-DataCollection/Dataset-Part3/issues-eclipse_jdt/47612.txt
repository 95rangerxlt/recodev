The cursor is left in an incorrect position after choosing an option (using
Enter key) from the code assist pop-up.

Create a class, Test, with a main method. When using code assist inside the main
method for class/method completion (not template expansion), the cursor keeps
being positioned to one of:
- after the closing brace of the main method,
- after the closing brace of the class,
- last character of the file.
The cursor should end up after the text chosen from the pop-up. Template
expansion works OK.

Tried with code assist preferences both on "completion inserts" and "completion
overwrites".

Cursor positioning has worked correctly on longer classes.

there are still some caret positioning issues with M9 - we should check if this
is reproducable or close.
cannot reproduce the given steps. closing.

I have seen some non-reproducable cases where the offset after content assist
was wrong when used together with linked mode. Will file a new PR once I find a
case.
