The type hierarchies on new Cloneable(){} and new Object(){} do not include the anonymous type itself. IMO, the focus type should always be shown in the hierarchy. Supertype hierarchy is fine.

class Type {
    void m() {
        new Cloneable() {}; // Type Hier. is only Object
        new Object() {};    // Type Hier. is only Object
        
        new Thread() {};    // Type Hier. is fine
    }
}
