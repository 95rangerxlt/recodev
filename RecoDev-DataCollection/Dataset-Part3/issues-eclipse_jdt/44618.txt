The indentation of the smart brace seems to have an extra tab inserted.  For
example, if I get the following:

if( bTest == true )
    {
        // ... do something
    }

as opposed to:

if( bTest == true )
{
    // ... do something
}

This seemed to start in 3.0M2.  I am currently using Version: 3.0.0 Build id:
200308281813.

I have tested this on the Linux-GTK 3.0M3 build and it works properly.

has been fixed a while ago. I suggest to use M4 as soon as it is available.
