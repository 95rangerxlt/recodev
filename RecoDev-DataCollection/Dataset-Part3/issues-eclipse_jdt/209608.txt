Only the first run of all clean ups does clean up JUnit source, because the changes are applied but not reverted. Subsequent runs do clean up the cleaned up source and generate no changes anymore.

Needs also be fixed in base tests.

I thinks that's why we can't see bug 208562

This is a must fix

So, you should revert the change and wait for the new baseline to be run before (hopefully Friday)...

Ok, I did that, I don't want to make anyone nervous;-). Is there a base line schedule, or does it always run on Friday? How can find out if a new base line is made?
