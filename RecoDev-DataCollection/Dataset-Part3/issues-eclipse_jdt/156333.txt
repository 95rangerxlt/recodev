Bug created to not forget that the fix for bug 148706 should also be implemented in 3.3.
Martin has already released the initial patch for bug 148706. There was a small follow up fix on JavaDropAdapterAssistant v1.2.2.1 in the 3.2.2 stream that needs to be ported to v1.2 in the 3.3 stream to close this defect
The 3.3 stream is up to date. Marking as fixed.
