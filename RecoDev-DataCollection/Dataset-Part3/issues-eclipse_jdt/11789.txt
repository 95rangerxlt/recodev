projects:
  target position is always a child of the (invisible) root,
  no matter what was selected

other resources:
  target position is child of selected root

Explorer pastes resources as neighbours -> I can hit CTRL-C, CTRL-V in a row
and have a new copy, w/o needing to select the parent resource.

as does the navigator, so we should be consistent
projects:
 this is the eclipse platform behavior (copy project action is forwarded to the 
workbench)


M6 for the 'other resources' case
fixed for 20020402
updated test cases to reflect the new semantics
