With Eclipse 3.4 M6

In both of the following files, the root toc element has an extradir attribute:
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/topics_GettingStarted.xml
org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/topics_GettingStarted.xml

According to the extension point doc, the extradir attribute is only defined for a toc element in the plugin.xml file:
http://help.eclipse.org/help33/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_help_toc.html

It shouldn't appear in a toc file.

I removed this attribute in the platform doc, and it didn't seem to have an effect. In fact it referred to a non-existent file so I don't think it ever worked. Moving to JDT to fix the reference in JDT user doc.
Fixed for I2009050525-2000.
