If the Javadoc show in the Javadoc view is from an external location it is possible to show this Javadoc in a browser. An action should be provided to open the Javadoc in the browser for this cases. In all other cases the action should be disabled.

Opening the javadoc in a browser allows to use all goodies from a browser, think bookmarks. It's also a 'workaround' for the missing pin action.

The browser used should be either the internal or the external, depending on the users configuration.
