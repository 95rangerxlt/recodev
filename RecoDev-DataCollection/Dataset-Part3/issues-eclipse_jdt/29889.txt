I have the following specified in my typecomment:

/**
 * This represents an instance of ${enclosing_type}.
 */

Unfortunately, the "$" and the braces are thrown out and I'm left with:

/**
 * This represents an instance of enclosing_type.
 */

Where I really wanted the type name substituted in the comment.

Martin, I assume we are not providing the right context information. Correct. 
Otherwise it is a template bug.
By design 'enclosing tyupe is only usable for inner types.

We have a new story for type templates coming.
