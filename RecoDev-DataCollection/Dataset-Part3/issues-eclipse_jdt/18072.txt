Small request: when you select a code block that does not throw a checked exception, a popup window 
asks if you'd like to catch RuntimeException.  Can there be a "Don't show this message again" 
checkbox on the popup so we don't have to make the same choice every time?  Thanks.

we have to inform the user that there is now exception thrown. 

However, the default should be No and not Yes, then you just have to press 
return.

Also there in an String Externalization problem the title shows up 
as "&try/catch"
NLS bug got already fixed.

Marking as later since platform doesn't fix 18303 for 2.0
Reopen for investigation
Added work around for default button. This is now No.

Fixed for 2.1 RC1.
Instead of catching RuntimeException it could be a bit smarter and check the 
@throws javadoc and catch the exceptions listed there.

This request is covered by bug 18687.
