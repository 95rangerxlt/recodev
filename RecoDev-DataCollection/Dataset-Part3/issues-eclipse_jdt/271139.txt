In Eclipse, 

select a java file, 
refactor->rename

note the 4 buttons at bottom: back|next|cancel|finish

the right edge of next is cut off.

Kevin indicates that this can be a problem caused by JDT-UI (by using negative numbers for horizonal alignment).

I've seen this on Linux/gtk+ since the end of time. Same problem?
Originally reported against cocoa. Removing the width hint fixes the problem for me.

Wow, you've seen past the end of time? ;-)

I've seen that too yesterday on Cocoa, and took a private note to investigate on the I-build. But if you also see it on GTK, it's probably not an SWT problem.

Maybe, but we want the 4 buttons to keep equal widths. The fix will probably be to add the horizontalSpacing from the main button bar composite to the widthHint. I'm still a bit puzzled because nothing in our code is platform-dependent, so I would have expected to see this everywhere or nowhere (and I don't even see it on our old GTK box).
Looks like this on Linux with Eclipse Version: 3.5.0 Build id: I20090313-0100

libgtk2.0-0 (2.14.4) Ubuntu 8.10

Fixed in HEAD.
