build F2
A class that does not implement all methods from an interface it implements or abstract 
class it extends from is in Error.
The className is red-highlighted and the Text-Hover displays 
the message:"
Class <classname> must implement the inherited abstract method <super-method-
name>."

Since we have this information. Is it difficult have a Quick Fix displaying at least 2 
possiblities:
"Make this class Abstract"
"Override the super-method"
