build I20040326-0800

- wanting to find out who calls IPage.setFocus(), I selected it and hit Ctrl+Shift+G
- it found lots of references in subclasses' Javadoc (often auto-generated)
- e.g. AbstractDebugView$ViewerPage has:
	/**
	 * @see IPage#setFocus()
	 */
	public void setFocus() {

This clutters the search results when all I want is the senders.

Perhaps we should have References, Declarations and Senders search menus (with
Ctrl+Shift+G for Senders)?

We should provide filters to filter out matches in Java doc. However this 
first requires support from JDT/Core since we can't distinguish Javadoc form 
code matches right now.
We now offer filtering in the search view.
