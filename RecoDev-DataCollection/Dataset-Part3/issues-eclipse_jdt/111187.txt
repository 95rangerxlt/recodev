Hi,

under eclipse 3.2M2 the generation of serial version ID hangs out. The Progress 
Information popup shows the info "Computing serial version ID...", "Starting 
virtual machine..." and the second virtual maschine is started but nothing 
happens. If i kill the corresponding process the default serial version ID will 
be generated.
I use the following JDK version:
java version "1.4.2_08"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_08-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_08-b03, mixed mode)

The same problem occurs with jdk1.5.0_05:

java version "1.5.0_05"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_05-b05)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_05-b05, mixed mode, sharing)
The described problem not more occurs under eclipse build id: I20050928-1300 :-)
