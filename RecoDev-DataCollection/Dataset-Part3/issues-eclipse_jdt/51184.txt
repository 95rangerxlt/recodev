Eclipse 3.0 M6.

The following preference pages do not inherit their font settings from their 
parent Composite.  Of course, this could be by design, but I doubt it.  You can 
see this by changing the Dialog Font preference (Workspace > Fonts) from the 
default, 8 points, to something big such as 16 points.  Next time you open the 
preferences you'll see that most other pages respect the Dialog Font setting. 
The offenders are as follows:

Java > Code Formatter
	- Preview text area.

Java > Code Formatter (WIP turned on)
	- Preview text area.
	- Dialog that opens after Clicking the "Edit..." button.

Java > Editor > Syntax tab
	- Preview text area.

Java > Editor > Templates
	- Preview text area.

Java > Work in Progress
	- The whole page.


There are other preference page offenders in Platform and Team, for which I'll 
submit individual bug reports.

The text font is controled by the 'Java editor text font'.

fixed the 'Work In progress' page > 20040105
While looking at M7 today I saw another "resize offender" in the new code 
formatting "Show Profile" dialog.  See that attached screen shot.
Sorry, please disregard comment 2.  This was supposed to go into bug 45033.
In M7 the following preference pages still have font issues:

Java > Code Formatter
  - Names notebook page. (see note below)
  - Code and Comments notebook page.

Note: Once the Names notebook page is fixed to use the selected dialog font, 
you might want to consider having the table consume remaining vertical 
whitespace.  I appreciate that there is no way to add/remove table items, but 
if the row height increases you'll probably find that the table get scroll bars.
