On the second page of the application bundle exporter the Add Folder buttons have no effect.
Instead the open folder dialogs appear after pressing the "Add File" button and after dismissing the 
resulting open file dialog. So it seems that selection handlers for the Add Folder buttons are in fact 
registered woth the add file buttons.
