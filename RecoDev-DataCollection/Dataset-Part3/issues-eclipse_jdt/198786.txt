Use Extract Class on ArrayLenghthAccess leads to a NPE
This is because the org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.refactoring.structure.ExtractClassRefactoring.FieldReferenceFinder.checkVariableBinding(IVariableBinding) does not check if the declaringClass is null, which is the case for the length field.
Can you fix it?
