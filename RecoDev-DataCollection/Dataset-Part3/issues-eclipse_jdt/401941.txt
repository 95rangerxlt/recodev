Large-scale review of all JLS8 DOM/AST changes.

Major topics:
- removed "infos" from extra dimension APIs
- added more instructions to ASTNode (and followed them)
- fixed ordering of property declarations, in traversal/clone/match/etc. operations, and in implementations where regularity reduces errors
- fixed @since tags (missing/redundant)
- many Javadoc fixes (missing @exception UnsupportedOperationException tags, missing "added in JLS8 API", etc.)
- properly implemented properties in abstract AST node types. VariableDeclaration was already in a bad shape in 3.8, but at least the necessary APIs were there and were correctly implemented. I cleaned this up, moved all fields and accessors etc. into the superclass, and added VariableDeclaration#getExtraDimensions2Property().
Added AnnotatableType#getAnnotationsProperty() and also moved all the implementations to the supertype.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?id=f0d3823e693314be74db80c5730855ddd690aa1f
I quickly glanced through the patch and this leaves the code base with
lot less clutter and much cleaner documentation. The scope of this patch
exceeds the Java 8 related areas and cleans up some Java 7 work and even 
prior code base - Thanks Markus.

Jay & Manoj, please study this patch in detail and try to categorize the
changes into buckets so we can internalize the better practices embodied.
> - removed "infos" from extra dimension APIs

Forgot this for org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.MethodDeclaration's EXTRA_DIMENSION_INFOS_PROPERTY. Changed to EXTRA_DIMENSIONS2_PROPERTY:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?id=31085e35ec6546fd0ce14d2c37082b7385a37318

Also fixed id and initialization in VariableDeclaration and subclasses:
