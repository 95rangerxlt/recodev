public class Ad extends Object{
}
class D extends Ad{
}

it will not let me add a constructor to D even though
D(){
 super();
}
would be what i want to have generated

Would you expect this to work if in your example class Ad didn't extend Object 
explicitly? Do you always want to have the ability to generate a default 
constructor from the wizard?
I need some input on this plz.
i think the default constructor should be included whenever the superclass does 
not define an explicit one
so yes, even if Ad does not explicitly extend Object

proposed fix.

Provides the root type constructors when applicable. Modifies StubUtility
method since it seems to be specific to this source action. It would be nice to
have a getConstructors() method for IType I think.
