Previous to Luna, the default keyboard accelerator for Select Enclosing Element was ⌃⇧↑, which was already pretty difficult to type, especially on a laptop keyboard where the fn key gets in the way. (The equivalent action in IntelliJ is bound to ⌘W.) Since Mavericks now stolen that key combination to something useless, the default keybinding in Luna was changed to ⌃⌥⇧↑. Unfortunately, this is almost impossible to get your fingers onto, at least on a laptop. Of course the user can change this, but there's no reason to not provide something a bit more comfortable by default. I recommend the following _much_ more ergonomic combinations:

- ⌃⇞ for Select Enclosing Element, and
- ⌃⇟ for Restore Last Selection.

It's actually *very* easy to type these combinations on a Mac laptop (it's fn+control+uparrow and fn+control+downarrow) since the fn and control keys are right next to each other.

Thanks for speaking up. This was recently changed with bug 426291. I agree the CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+ARROW_* shortcuts are hard to use, and I like the idea of using PAGE_UP/DOWN instead.

However, SWT already uses CTRL+PAGE_UP/DOWN for Previous/Next Tab, e.g. to go to the next editor tab if multiple editors are open. Furthermore, SHIFT is part of every other shortcut that extends/shrinks the selection.

I've changed the shortcuts to CTRL+SHIFT+PAGE_UP/PAGE_DOWN/HOME/END, i.e.
⌃⇧⇞ for Select Enclosing Element, etc.. This should be easier to type on the small Apple keyboards, and it's also fine (even one key less) on keyboards with dedicated PAGE_UP etc. keys.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=4152df79f341f355d4b6c388931d2dbeabee8325
Thanks Markus, I can live with that :-)
