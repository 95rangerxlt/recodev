When the first project you create in a Workbench is a JavaProject you end up
getting it added twice to the viewer. 

This is because the items get added both as a result of the selectReveal in 
the New Java Project Wizard and as a result of postAdd called due to the 
resource listener in the view.

This extra item does not get created the second time so it appears to be 
something to do with the empty view case.

Previously the tree viewer always called a refresh on an add so this problem 
was not exposed. This was a bug that had been fixed for 20030701.

@see PackageExplorerContentProvider#postAdd()
@see PackageExplorerPart#selectReveal()

STEPS
1) Start a new workbench
2) Create aProject Fred
3) Fred will appear twice in the PackageExplorer
4) Create a project Bob
5) Bob will only appear once

Note this is does not occur in the Resource Navigator

*** Bug 39740 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The problem is more general and shows up with any first child on any level of 
the tree. 

The difference between the Navigator and the PackageExplorer is that the use 
of syncExec in the Navigator and the PackageExplorer is using asyncExec (filed 
a seperate reminder bug to revisit this decision).

Here is what is going on:
1) the java element delta is processed and a runnable to add the new element 
is posted
2) the runnable posted from the BasicNewWizard to reveal the selection using 
the ISetSelectionTarget is processed. This results in a call to setSelection.
3) when the treeviewer receives a setSelection it expands its children unless 
the children already exist and selects the new element. This results in 
refreshing the children and fetching the new item
4) the post add runnable is executed and the same element is added a second 
time.

We cannot blame JFace since the implementation of setSelection does the right 
thing. So the real culprit is the use of asyncExec when processing deltas.

The bug is fixed by testing whether the element is already in the tree inside 
of add runnable.
