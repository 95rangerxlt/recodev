Build F1

In the Build Path page of a project's properties, select the 'Libraries' tab 
and select a library with a variable.

There are many usability problems with the 'Edit' option:

- To change the extension, you must click on 'Add Extension'. This is 
counterintuitive - it already has an extension, I just want to change it.

- When you click on Add Extension, the dialog that appears is very 
frustrating. If you double click on a folder, it treats that like 'Ok'. As a 
Windows user, I expect folders to expand when I double click on them. 
(Besides, do we even allow a variable on the build path to point to a folder? 
We didn't in previous builds).

- The dialog that appears when you press Add Extension isn't seeded with the 
existing extension. It should be seeded with the preevious extension, or as 
close to it as possible.

Here's what I actually did when I tried to use this:

- the name of a JAR file changed, so I had to fix the variable in my build 
path to point to it
- I opened up the Build Path page, found the bogus entry, and clicked 'Edit'
- it was unclear what to do on the dialog that appeared, so I clicked 
its 'Edit' button
- this was the wrong thing to do, so I pressed 'Cancel'
- I guessed that maybe I needed to press 'Add Extension...', so I tried that
- I knew that the JAR that I wanted was in a plugin, so I double clicked on 
the plugin folder
- the dialog closed, and changed my entry to point at the plugin directory
- this obviously wasn't what I wanted, so I cancelled the properties dialog 
and opened it again
- I was a bit more careful this time, and succeeded in expanding the plugin 
folder
- but I couldn't remember the name of the plugin, and it was hidden behind the 
second dialog (the Edit Variable Entry dialog)
- so I cancelled the first two dialogs
- I then widened the properties dialog so that I could see the previous value 
of the entry
- I clicked on Edit
- I moved the dialog so that it wouldn't hide the entry in the first dialog
- then I clicked 'Add Extended'
- once again I had to move the dialog to see the first dialog
- I then screwed up and double clicked on a folder again, so I had to cancel 
and start over

Note that a good UI for editing variable entries already exists in Eclipse.

Click ok 'Attach source'. It provides a much more intuitive UI for a very 
similar task.
