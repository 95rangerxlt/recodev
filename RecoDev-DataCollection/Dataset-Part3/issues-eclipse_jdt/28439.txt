maybe it's the desired behavior, i don't know. but it feels strange
1. junit 3.7 with 2 src folders (one has everything and the other some random
packages)
2. select the project - stuff is shown in packages view
3. select a package
4. select the project again - nothing happens in the packages view
 to make anything change you have to click around a couple of times
