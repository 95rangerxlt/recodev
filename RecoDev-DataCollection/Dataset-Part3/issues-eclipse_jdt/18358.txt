Build 20020528 - 20020530. Clicking on a member or method in the hierarchy view 
with the "Show source of selected elements only" on, goes to the top of the 
file. This seems to be a regression as I saw this bug half a year ago.

It is not a consistent bug. It seems like a state that it can get into. I now 
seem to be able to navigate just fine...
Dirk pls investigate
Scenario to reproduce

- JUnit setup
- check reconcile option in Preferences->Java
- check show members in packages view
- reveal and select type test case in packages view (note not CU)
- open type hierarchy of TestCase
- double click on a method
  observe:
  first the method gets shown and then the type

Problem is that reconciling cause the package view to refresh the CU TestCase 
which causes a selection change event on type TestCase which cause the editor 
to reveal the type
Views that feed an editor with their current selection now check if the view is 
the active part. If not the view deosn't feed the editor

Fixed in build > 20020531
