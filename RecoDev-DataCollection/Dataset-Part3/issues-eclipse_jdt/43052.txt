using code assist to complete the for loop (array with temporary variable)

Confirm bug in I20030916

Problem is that the exclude list in the call
NamingConventions.suggestLocalVariableNames(...) in method
JavaContext.guessArrayElement() only contains local names returned by J Core and
this does not include the new index.

Added the index (getIndex()) to the exclude list.
