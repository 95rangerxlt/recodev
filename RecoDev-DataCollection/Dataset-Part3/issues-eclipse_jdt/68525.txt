the hierarchy view

attching a pic to be clear what i mean.
the shown label does not wrap when you make the view smaller
The label and toolbar is controlled by Platform/UI.

Nope. It's not the view description. It's a non-wrapping label in our PageBook.
I'll fix this.
Fixed in TypeHierarchyViewPart by creating label with style
SWT.TOP | SWT.LEFT | SWT.WRAP.
