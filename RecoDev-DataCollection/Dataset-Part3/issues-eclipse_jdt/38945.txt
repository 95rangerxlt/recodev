When inserting an AST node into a list I am not able to control if the node is 
inserted before or after another node. Hence I don' have control of empty 
lines between statements. Currently new nodes are always inserted before 
another node. 

Example:

foo();

bar();

Inserted a new statement baz(); after foo(); always produces:

foo();

baz();
bar();

but I would like to be able to produce:

foo();
baz();

bar();
