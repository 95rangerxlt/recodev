If your JRE_LIB has been set (say by importing preferences) and you reset to 
default you will still have the imported value.

STEPS
1) Import the (to be attached) preferences file
2) Open the classpath variables page
3) Select restore defaults - JRE_LIB will show up as reserved
4) Select OK
5) Reopen the preferences
6) Select classpath variables page - JRE_LIB is not reset.

JRE_LIB is bound to the default JRE - pressing the "Restore Defaults" will have 
no effect.
JRE lib is always bound to the default JRE (as indicated with the check box on 
the installed JREs preference page) - restoring defaults will not have any 
effect.
You should at least keep the look consistent for the user.

Are you saying that the obsolete path shown to the user is not the actual 
path? If not then you should show the correct one.
This preference page is owned by JDT-UI. Moving there.

I do not beleive that the "Restore Defaults" button should be present on this 
preference page, as this operation does not makes sense for classpath 
variables - you would need to call the classpath variable initializers to do 
this (and even then, there is no notion of default). Clearing the list is not 
the desired behavior either (which is the current behavior).

The JRE_LIB variable tracks the default JRE as checked in the Installed JRE 
preferece page. If there is no default JRE, it will be empty.


Fixed for RC2. The defaults button got removed.
