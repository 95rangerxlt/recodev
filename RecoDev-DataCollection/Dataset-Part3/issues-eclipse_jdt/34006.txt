One of the translators believes the english string in the file:

org.eclipse.jdt.ui\jdt_jar\org\eclispe\jdt\internal\context\textmanipulation\Me
ssages.properties

Is incorrect.  The strings in question are:

CopyTargetEdit.length=Target length is created than zero.
MoveTargetEdit.length=Target length is created than zero.

"I believe the text to translate is wrong. Could you tell us which is 
the right sentence here?

Thanks and regards
Antonella"


I believe the translator's comment.  The sentence looks odd but I don't have 
context to make a definitive call.

The correct text must be "Target length is unequal zero".

Fixed for RC2.
