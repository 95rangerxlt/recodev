Build: 20020426 (M5++)

to reproduce the problem:

1. new class
2. keep editor open for the class
3. new default visibility field
4. make the class read-only
5. in the outliner select the field
6. from the pulldown select refactor->self-encapsulate
7. the operation attempts to run and then fails
8. click undo to undo the changes, your editor will be marked dirty, but you 
can't save because the file is read-only

The operation now issues a fatal error if the file is read-only.
