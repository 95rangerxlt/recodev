build 20020806

-In the Windows explorer copy a workspace folder to the clipbaord (using 
context menu->Copy)
-In the Eclipse package explorer select the parent of the folder in the same 
workspace
-Paste the folder into the workspace
->The operation starts and eventually fails, leaving lots of sub folders in the 
workspace. 
Drag and drop import has the same problem.

The copy/paste side of the problem is in the CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation of 
the workbench. Opened bug 22444 for that. I'm going to release a fix in a few 
days, when I'm done with refactoring and other cleanup.
I suggest that you use the CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation for drag and drop 
import as well. I'm in the process of changing the Navigator dnd import (which 
was the only import that guarded against this) to use the 
CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation.

cannot reproduce on the latest
I gave the wrong steps to reproduce. The steps above result in an error which 
they shouldn't either (in that scenario Navigator should prompt to rename and 
JDT should disallow import).

The correct paste location to reproduce this error would be the folder itself.
If A/aFolder is imported into A/aFolder you get the recursion. 
in that case i get: 'Cannot import .. The source and destination are the same'

Which build are you running on? I still see this in 20020903.
Correction: I still see this problem under certain cirumstances. I see it in 
one runtime workspace, if I use the same workspace as the debug target the 
problem disappears. Another workspace is fine whether used as runtime or target.
I use workspaceRoot.getContainerForLocation(sourcePath); to find out if an 
imported resource is already in the workspace. In the failure scenario this 
returns null - even if the sourcePath and workspaceRoot are the same as in the 
successful scenario.
Investigating, in any case the problem would be addressed for both JDT and 
Workbench UI since JDT uses Workbench CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation for 
clipboard paste import. This is not true for drag and drop import.
getContainerForLocation returns null when the -data path to the workspace and 
the location are not case identical.
My workspace directory was Platform-UI and -data specified .../platform-UI 
(lowercase p).
Adam, can you change the case of your workspace location (without changing the -
data parameter) and drag and drop a folder onto itself. You should see the same 
problem.
Will open a Core bug.
Core bug is bug 16202.
Working around in Workbench CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation so JDT paste action is 
fixed automatically. 
JDT DND import should still switch to using Workbench operation.
we use this
org.eclipse.ui.wizards.datatransfer.ImportOperation;
is that what you're referring to?
No, it's CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation.copyFiles.
copyFiles itself uses the ImportOperation that you now use directly. It 
additionally verifies the import destination to prevent core exceptions from 
reaching the user.
intend to resolve for M4 somehow
did not make it
fixed for M5
