The workarounds due to the use of asyncExec are piling up.
Another one just got added: bug# 39754.

Given the new responsiveness work it should be more safe to use syncExec now.

We should just experimentally change to syncExec.

I opt the switch to sync exec early of M3. Erich your opinion ?
agreed - suggest that you and I act as pioneers and run a couple of days with 
syncExec before throwing the switch.
Ok, then lets change it when I am back from vacation (>= 28.07.2003)
changed to sync > 20061218

Will try out this week. So far it looks good.
After discussion with John A. I found out that the navigator also has to switch to asyncExec (bug 75843).
I improved the current updating so that all updates are collected and posted at once. revealElement can now run all pending updates itself (instead of using asuncExec) to make sure that newly added elements can be found.
