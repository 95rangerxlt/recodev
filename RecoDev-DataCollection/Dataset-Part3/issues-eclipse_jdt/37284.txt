Preconditions:
i.  A "Java" project must exist with the following folder structure.
myProject
->src
-->web
--->public
---->myCompany

Reproduction
i.   Launch the Eclipse platform
ii.  Open Perspective "Java"
iii. In the Menu select
    Window->Show View->Package Explorer
iv.  Right-Click "myProject" -> Open Project
v.   Click the tree node to expand "myProject"
vi.  Click the tree node to expand "src"
vii. Click the tree node to expand "web"
viii.Click the tree node to expand "public"


The "myCompany" folder does not appear.  Only files withing the public folder
appear and any content beneath it is unavailable.  I have confirmed this in both
Windows2000 Professional and Red-Hat Linux 7.2

Project Directory Used

Is a jar of the project directory used to reproduce this bug.
When the folder in the file system is renamed from "public" to "myPublic" and 
the "web" folder in the Package Explorer is Refreshed, all subsequent sub 
folders will show up.

I created a project (Java) called 'myProject' and then used your zip file to
populate it.  I then did a 'refresh', changed the project properties so that
myProject/src was the source directory and took a look at what was contained in
this project.  I could see the 'myCompany' directory under 'public'.

Could you verify that this is not a problem with the environment.  Perhaps try
creating another Java project with the same directory structure somewhere else.


I was using build I20030527 on WinXP with vm jdk1.4.1_02 to try to reproduce
this problem.
I am using Version: 2.1.0, Build id: 200303272130 with vm jdk 1.3.1_06-b01 on
winXP Pro SP1.  I have re-produced it on multiple environments.

Could it be that it has been fixed as a result of another fix, or some ambitious
developer fixed it without a bug report?  The reason I ask is i notice the
difference in the eclipse versions we are using.

I doubt the environment is the culprit due to the fact that i can readily
reproduce the problem in both win32 and linux platforms by simply renaming a folder.

If you have any further thoughts/questions, just e-mail me directly.
Am now able to reproduce this problem.  The problem appears to be in the 
released version of 2.1 (which I believe is the same as M200303272130) but 
does not appear in the 2.1 maintenance stream build M20030528.  Am reassigning 
this to JDT.  Please mark as a duplicate if another PR already exists for this 
problem.  The exact steps I used to reproduce this in Release Build 2.1 are:
- create a new environment on WinXP with release 2.1, using vm 1.3.1_06
- File->New->Project->Java->Java Project
- when prompted, I gave the project the name 'myProject'
- was asked if I wished to convert to the Java perspective and I said yes
- at this point the Package Explorer view is present.
- I had unziped the data from attachment 3 on this PR.  Went to the place 
where I had this data and copied the directories bin and src.  Went to 
<workspace>/plugins/myProject and pasted these 2 directories there.
- in Package Explorer, left click myProject to select it, then right click and 
Refresh so these new directories are recognized by Eclipse
- in Package Explorer, left click myProject to select it (not really necessary 
as it is already selected), right click, Properties.  Under Java Build Path, 
select the Source tab and Add Folder.  Expand myProject, and select src.  
Click Ok, then yes to the query and finally ok so that 'src' is the source 
directory for this project.
- now expand myProject in Package Explorer to find that the 'myCompany' 
directory is not present under 'public'
- open view Navigator and find that 'myCompany' is under 'public'
