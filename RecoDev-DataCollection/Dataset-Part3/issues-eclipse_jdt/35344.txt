1. Change background color of Java editor to black or other color different 
from System default (Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Syntax(page)). Also 
there change color of some Java elements.
2. Background color of text field in Window->Preferences->Java->Code formatter 
remains to be System default but Java element colors are the same we set in 1 
step.
