Using HEAD stream...

In following example:
public class Test {
	public String foo(){
		return "";} //$NON-NLS-1$
}

the end position of MethodDeclaration for foo is on ';' character in source
although its body correctly ends at '}' character.

This is really anoying as method declaration ends before its body child...
One impact of this is that trailing comment can be associated neither to the
method declaration nor to the body.

Note that it works with 3.0 => seems to be a regression while merging JDK_1_5
stream. Looking at code, ASTConverter.retrieveRightBraceOrSemiColonPosition(int,
int) method now returns now scanner.currentPosition-1 instead of previously
scanner.currentPosition when brace is found.

Note also that method declaration end position is correct with following example:
public class Test {
	public String foo(){
		return "";
	} //$NON-NLS-1$
}

I will investigate.
I think that retrieveRightBraceOrSemiColonPosition should be called with bodyEnd
+ 1 instead of bodyEnd for the first argument. Otherwise the ; is found and its
position is returned.
