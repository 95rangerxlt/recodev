patch to change versiosn to "4.3.0"

The pom.xml file in "tests-pom" directory was (apparently) copied from 'master', and therefore points to "4.4.0" jdt.core parent, which does not exist in this branch. 

I suggest the artifact, and the parent it points to both be changed to "4.3.0" to be more consistent with a "branch from kepler".
