To avoid confusion, we have collapsed our file revision API into a single interface. I have left a stub of the old one in to prevent breakage. I will attach a patch that converts existing JDT code to use the new interface. We would like to remove the old interface before M5.

Another patch

Here's another patch to react to some more API changes. Please release this for Tuesday's I-build since the Team Java content provider won't work properly without it.
With regard to the latest patch, it is separate from the previous one so they both need to be applied. I couldn't make the changes in the second patch without breaking the content provider in some way. Perhaps we can put all these in (and the IDiffNode to IDiff) later on Monday and get it all out of the way in one shot.
