Build N20020813

Test Case:
1. From the package explorer open a class from a JAR without attached source
2. Activate the editor
3. Select something in another view
   (note: selection is blue)
4. Activate the class file editor by clicking on the tab
==> selection in other view remains blue but should be gray.

Suggest to set the keyboard focus to the "Attach Source..." button
