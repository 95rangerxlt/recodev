Refactor > Move a constant field.
The wizard has an option "Keep original method as delegate to moved method".
-> Should be "member", not "method"
-> Same problem when moving two constants at once

Still same in version 3.5.2 (Galileo SR2)

When you change anything that could be accessed from multiple locations, you always need to check *all* references to make sure the change makes sense everywhere.

In this case, the strings you changed in refactoring.properties are also used by the Move Instance Method wizard, and there the labels should keep saying "method".

Yes I saw that and thought "member" would cover that case as well.

Fixed in HEAD. Added separate constants for members in
