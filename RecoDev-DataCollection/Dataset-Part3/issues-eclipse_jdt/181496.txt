The id description for classpathContainerPage is currently the following:
id - identifies the classpath container as defined by org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathVariableInitializer 

But it should be (* to indicate difference):
id - identifies the classpath container *initializer* as defined by *org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathContainerInitializer*

No, the id really relates to the classpath container. Both the initializer and the page refer to the id of the container.

I changed the description to:

identified the classpath containers for which this page will be used. The id corresponds to the first segment of the path of a container classpath entry and matches the id referenced in <samp>org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathVariableInitializer</samp>)

Does that make sense to you?
"org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathVariableInitializer" should be "org.eclipse.jdt.core.classpathContainerInitializer"... there is no CPE_VARIABLE involved in this extension point.
You are correct. Thanks!
