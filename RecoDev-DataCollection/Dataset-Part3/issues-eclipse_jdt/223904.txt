The little black triangle in the breadcrumb toolbar item stands out. When you compare the sizes of the triangle between the toolbar item and the actual triangle in the breadcrumbs header, you can see that the triangle in the toolbar is two pixels taller. Screenshot to follow.

I also don't like the fact that the toolbar item is not the same height as all the other items in the toolbar.
Fully agree. We are still waiting for the icons from the UI design team.
Benno, I suggest not to spend time on this but rather push the UI designer again.
I've released a slightly improved icon for M6 (smaller, less black triangle) and I've also removed the unused icons 'breadcrumb_go_left' and 'breadcrumb_go_right'.
