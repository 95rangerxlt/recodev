Steps to reproduce:
1) Set up a CVS repository connection.
2) Locate an existing Java project in the CVS repository. Right click on the
HEAD branch of the project and choose "Check Out as Project".
3) Navigate to the Resource perspective and open a Java source file in the newly
created project. In my project, all source files are found under the "src"
subdirectory.
4) Navigate within the source file to any function. Start typing the following
(slowly) to trigger the code assist functionality:
System.
5) An error popup is shown. The title of the error window is "Error Accessing
Compilation Unit", and the message shown in the error window is "Cannot access
compilation unit. Reason: <project_name> does not exist." where "<project_name>"
is the name of the checked out project in step 2. This message appears every
time the code assist functionality is invoked, which makes it difficult to edit
Java code in a CVS project.

I am unable to reproduce this. Does this happen for all Java projects for you? 
Does it happen to others you work with (if you happen to be working with other 
users of Eclipse)? Could you provide anything more specific that may provide a 
reproducable error?
Reopening
The problem is that the project has a .project in the repository that does not 
contain the Java nature. Deleting the .project from the repository and 
performing a Checkout As... should allow the proper configuration of the 
project. 

I think that the error message from JDT could be improved so I'm moving to the 
JDT component.
Adapted summary. Problem is unrelated to CVS.

Improved error message in case of JavaModelException.isDoesNotExist() and if the
CU is not on the build path.
