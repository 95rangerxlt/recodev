I20041201

With the following annotation type:
public @interface X {  
   int foo();
   int bar();
}
the members foo() and bar() don't appear public, wherease with the following
interface:
public interface I {  
   int foo();
   int bar();
}
the methods foo() and bar() appear public.

JavaElementImageProvider#getMethodImageDescriptor(...) checks if the type is an
interface. It should also check if the type is an annotation type.
