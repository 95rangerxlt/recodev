The default hotkey for code assist cmd-space is the same as the default activation hotkey for spotlight 
in OS X 10.4 (Tiger).  By default, when you press cmd-space, you get spotlight instead of code assist.  
Maybe ctrl-space should be the default hotkey??

Yes, I agree, on Mac we shouldn't use cmd-space as the default for content assist.

ctrl-space is an obvious alternative, but it isn't very Mac-like.
What's about Escape?
Xcode uses it..
Hmmm, Eclipse is so nice, I've never tried Xcode :)  

I agree that crtl-space is not very mac like, but I'm not sure I'd like escape.  I also use linux and hate 
pressing escape for some of the commands like comment section.  I suggested ctrl-space since it is used 
on other platforms.  Tab might also be a consideration (zsh uses tab for completion), but I could see some 
people not liking that either.
Sure, I agree
(my question was more a rhetorical question to get input from the Mac/Xcode community... :-) 

So let's use Ctrl-Space.
But be aware that this will apply for both Panther and Tiger!

The default key binding for content assist is now Ctrl+SPACE on all platforms.
I guess this should be mentioned in the readme since Cmd was used since day one.
Andr√©, do you agree or is this obvious to MAC users?
*** Bug 94137 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I have both French and English installed on my Mac. As it indicates is possible on the page Doug linked to 
in bug 94137, in this configuration, command-space rotates through the script systems. When I check my 
default "open spotlight search" keybinding, it is preset to control-space, so control-space is probably not 
a good choice for content assist either.
May I recommend "Option+Space" (i.e., "M3+SPACE" or "ALT+SPACE")?
See comment #7
Heh, I was just going to suggest option-space ... I'm good with that.
we'll do anything you want... waiting for Andre's opinion.
Re #7: Mike, if I install more than one input method on Tiger, the suggested shortcut to switch between 
input methods is Cmd-Space (and a conflict is shown with Spotlight). But I cannot find any magic that 
turns the Command-Space into Control-Space automatically if more than one input method is used. How 
did you do this? Was it really automatic?

Re #10: I don't like any Option-<some character> combinations because they typically produce a special 
character in some language. IIRC, Option-Space is already the non-breakable space (in any language).
In some locales such as Simplified Chinese, Ctrl+Space isn't available since it
conflicts with the Input Method Editor.  IIRC, we have a locale-specific binding
to Ctrl+. (period) for content assist.
To clarify comment 4 and comment 13: we only changed the existing stuff for the
MAC but did not remove the existing bindings registered for locale="zh" which
override M1+Space.
*sigh*. I have no idea where the control-space came from then. I am certain I didn't set it for spotlight, in 
particular, because I have done no key customization since installing Tiger. Could it have been pulled from 
some other previous binding?

In any case, we should just pick something non-conflicting and make sure users can easily set it to 
something they like better.

I suggest to go with the current solution i.e. use M1+Space except for
locale="zh" where we use M3+/ since day one.
(or day two ;-)
Yes, I agree. Let's stick to M1+Space.
I've checked the Apple HI Guidelines

XHIGKeyboardShortcuts/chapter_20_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH253

and Control-Space is not reserved by the system.
Marking as fixed.
