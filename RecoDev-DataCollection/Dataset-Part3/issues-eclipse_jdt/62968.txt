I200405190010

If I set the view to "Hierarchical Layout" in the Package Explorer my "src" 
folder shows as empty if there are no java files in the root package (i.e. 
only sub-packages at the first level).  Setting to "Flat" and they appear 
again.

Tried a new Java project to recreate, but the problem is not showing on new 
projects.

If you create a new Project called "Foo" which has the source directory 
as "src" and the output folder as "bin" then create two empty packages 
under "src" like this:

uk.ac.reload.dweezil.gui
uk.ac.reload.dweezil.pok

Then if you close the "Foo" tree nodes in the Package Explorer then toggle 
between "Flat" and "Hierarchical" Layout setting it to "Hierarchical" then 
open up the nodes again on the tree you'll see the contents of "src" gone.

Would be shame to let this bug slip into M9.

A workaround is to put a dummy file at the top package level.  In the test 
case above add a file "bogus.txt" in the src folder and you can see the 
packages again.

I am experiencing this as well, on linux gtk build I200405200010.
which was the first 'all-test-passed' build I used in some time.
a MUST-FIX for M9 IMO
the bogus-file-in-top-level-folder is not a working workaround for me.
I have a subpackage appearing after that, but the bug does not allow me to
expand that and see its own subpackages!

rather my workaround is removing the 'don't show empty parent packages' filter.
I have fixed this. Will be in I200405210010
Daniel, you are a star!

That's why I really love this Eclipse software.  You report a bug, and the 
developers listen and fix it...buy that man a beer!
