UI needs to be added for the options added by bug 155013
first version released > 20070512

At the moment the fine grained options are available only for type searches.

Do you plan to change the menu items as well or will it be only accessible in Java Search page?

If this is the latter (e.g. only accessible in the dialog), what about the search requests performed using menu items? Will they take into account the fine grain flags set in this page (as it is currently the case for 'Search in' check boxes)?

No, I thought to only offer this in the search dialog. The menu actions always find all references.
The menu actions don't use the settings from the search dialog. They also don't do this for the 'Search In' flags. The 'search in' flags are evaluated on the element that is searched on (if it makes sense to search in the JRE or not).
At least that how I remember it and a quick look in the code said.

I don't see how we can add all the options to the menu. Especially as you can select combinations of the flags.

The search result view will, in the future, be able to group the results by location. I think that will be a very useful feature.
in M4.

No further changes planed at the moment. Please add your comments here or file a bug for more.
