3.2 RC2 candidate

The <code>@BeforeClass</code> comment in the Javadoc below is not correctly rendered:

/**
 * A <code>Failure</code> holds a description of the failed test and the 
 * exception that was thrown while running it. In most cases the <code>Description</code>
 * will be of a single test. However, if problems are encountered while constructing the
 * test (for example, if a <code>@BeforeClass</code> method is not static), it may describe
 * something other than a single test.
 */

Seems like the @something is causing troubles

Please provide more details. Where is it wrong (code, Javadoc view, hover)? It looks OK to me.
Exact steps to reproduce:
- Create JUnit4 project
- Open type Failure in the Java editor
- Goto row 12, column 46

-> </code> is not rendered as a HTML tag, probably because of the @ of the annotation

</code> in "<code>@SomeText</code>" is rendered incorrectly.

The following patterns work:
"<code>@ SomeText</code>"
"<code>@SomeText </code>"

but "<code> @SomeText </code> is broken again: "</code>" is rendered correctly but "@someText" is rendered as tag.

Fixed in HEAD of JavaDocScanner.
