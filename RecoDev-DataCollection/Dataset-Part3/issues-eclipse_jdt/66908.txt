3.0 RC2

1) Create a class java.lang.String (shadowing the one from the JDK).
2) add a main method
3) invoke code assist on the String[] parameter type in the main method (after
"Str", for example
4) observe: you get two entries for String in the code assist popup, but the
javadoc that is shown for both is the same (i.e. the one for the local class).

Note that I do get correct (JDK) javadoc when I use code assist in some other
file (that doesn't see the duplicate String class).

step 4: only one String class is visible and hence J Core should not propose both
