I've edited my typecomment template to be the following:
/**
 * CLASS: ${enclosing_type}
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * DATE: ${date}
 * @author ${user}
 */
The enclosing_type variable does not resolve when creating the new object.  
After creation, I can "Add Javadoc Comment" and the enclosing_type is resolved.

Other variables that don't resolve inside the typecomment template:

    ${enclosing_package}
    ${enclosing_project}

Unassign due to staff changes.
I just tested this bug with Eclipse 2.1 and it seems to have been fixed, 
despite the staff changes.

Some explaination is necessary...

- The ${enclosing_type} variable is only bound when you have a nested type; it 
is bound to the outer class.

- The ${enclosing_package} variable has been replaced with ${package_name}.

- The ${enclosing_project} variable has been replaced with ${project_name}.


I believe that this bug report can be marked as RESOLVED/FIXED.
