I use stable build 20020321. Every time i start eclipse, i have to turned off
the checkbox "Preference->Java->JUnit->Keep Junit running....",because we are
working with jdk1.3. Unfortunatly eclipse forgot these setting, so that i have
to turn it off after every start of eclipse.

Debug does not own JUnit.
the keep alive option is now part of the launch configuration and properly 
persisted. the default is off.
