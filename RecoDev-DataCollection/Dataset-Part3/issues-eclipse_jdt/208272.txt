1. Set your workspace compiler compliance to 1.5
2. Open jdt.text.test properties
3. go to compiler compliance property page
Is:
 1.5 compliance
Should:
 1.4 compliance

Although project specific settings is enabled the workspace compliance is taken. Reason is that the value for the compliance got removed from the org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs file. It got removed by a change from dani 29.06.07: 'Convert to use manifest.mf'

How did you do this?
