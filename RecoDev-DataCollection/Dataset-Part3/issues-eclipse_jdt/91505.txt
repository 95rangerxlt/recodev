Typo in new API: JavaElementLabels.getDeclararionLabel(..)
                                             ^ should be t

Can we still correct this (it's new 3.1 API)?

Can we still correct this (it's new 3.1 API)?
Since the API is frozen I think we can't. What we can do is to deprecated the
current method and add one with the correct name.

Jeem, is this something you recommend doing for 3.1 or should we simply stick
with the typo.
I recommend you make this change asap (unless there is some particular reason 
you know of why this would be risky). It seems like a straightforward case of
a typo in an API signature of a new API class introduced in 3.1.

(Also, the copyright says "2000,2005". Is this correct (i.e., that some of the 
code in it was written back in 2000). If it's brand new class, I would expect
"2005". If it's an old internal class that was copyright "2000, x" that is 
just now being renamed and made API, then "2000, 2005" is correct.)


As suggested by Jeem I correct the name of the method.

It is an old class that was internal in the past.
