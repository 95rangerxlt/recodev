build I20081021-0905

For our projects, we have Save Actions turned on and since I updated to this build, every time I save a Java file I get a message dialog saying that the Organize Imports save action is very slow and I may want to turn it off. 

I don't mind hitting the "Do not show this message again" checkbox but I wonder if perhaps the tolerance should be modified... I would assume things like formatting and organize imports would be common save actions for users.

I run on the same build and have the save actions enabled (including formatting). Can you give me an example file and also what save actions you use?
Could reproduce.
I've also polished the dialog a bit.
Thanks Dani. For the record, we have formatting and organize imports turned on. Pascal was also getting this message on his Mac. (I am on XP) One project that this happened on was:

/cvsroot/rt
org.eclipse.equinox/p2/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins
class: PlatformXMLListener
