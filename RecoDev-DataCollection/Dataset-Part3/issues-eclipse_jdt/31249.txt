The default modifier for hyperlink style navigation is "Control" which doesn't work well on 
MacOS X because here the Control modifier is used to simulate a right-click (opening the 
context menu).
The consequence of this is that if control is pressed the users gets the underlined text 
style when hovering, but he cannot follow the link because a click results in opening the 
context menu.
The default on MacOS should be 'Command'
