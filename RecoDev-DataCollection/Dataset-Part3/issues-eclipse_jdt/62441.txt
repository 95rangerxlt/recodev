available in builds >= 200405170800
Still does not work in M9 (200405211200). The Package Explorer context menu 
does not contain "Override/Implement Methods..." menu item. When I select this 
action from the editor context menu, "The operation is not applicable ..." 
message box is displayed.

abstract class CSI {
	void f() {
		new Comparable() {
			
		};
	}
}
there's no menu but you can do it using code assist:
type new YourClassGoesHere(<code assist>
  I don't think the context menu item ought to be disabled, coz from the view 
of inheriting, there's no deference between named subclasses and anonymous 
inner classes. although the current content assist behavior is really great and 
attractive. the former is mandarine and should not be replaced by the latter, 
which is just a shortcut, i think.
