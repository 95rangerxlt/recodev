- Fallback is removed
- CleanUps now do a pre and post condition check where they can return a RefactoringStatus which is shown in the refactoring dialog if the status is not OK.
- Batch parser is used to resolve bindings to get the binary names of serializable types.
- Code is cleaned up, feedback is welcome...
