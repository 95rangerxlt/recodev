Screenshot of blank errors.

With expressions in expressions view, when I select a native method in Debug view, the expressions turn red indicating an error.  But when I expand the expressions, the line below is blank.  However when I select another method, where the variables are not valid, the error messages appear.  Other times, though, the labels appear only partially updated, suggesting some kind of race condition.

I see blank error messages as well on XP for any expressions that have errors - for example an expression like "foo" which cannot be resolved. Selecting the blank expression reveals the error message in the details pane.
Fixed in ViewerAdapaterService and DefaultLabelProvider. There were no label provider adapters registered for String.
please verify, Pawel.
