Sorry for summary being not very specific, it would be too long to list it all
in there.
Here are the details of the problem:

Eclipse  : v3 build I1119
OS       : Windows 2000 and SuSE Linux 8.2 used and I assume it applies to any
JRE      : Sun 1.4.1_02 and IBM 1.4.1

Activity : 
Use the Eclipse for working on regular java app with up to 200 lines of code.

Problem :
After a while (10-30 minutes) following occurs:
1. The cursor allways gets positioned on the begining of the line when Enter is hit
2. On Linux, when Tab is pressed, the content of the editor window is first
redrawn without syntax colors and positioned at the begining of the file and
then the syntax colors are added and position is changed to where it was before.
3. Key F3 does not move to the type or method declaration
4. Key combination Ctrl+Space does nothing, however typing a dot and waiting
will show the code completion (in applicable context).
5. If the eclipse is started without -vmarg -Djava.compiler=NONE it will also
fail to do Save operation and will bring up error dialog, usualy informing that
an NullPointerException has occured.

The above problems might cover different components so I suggest that this bug
is kept as a parent one and once the problematic components are identified, bugs
for individual components can be opened.

As to the recreation of the problems, it occurs allways, so the Eclipse team
should not have any problem recreating it with the above specified build, OS and
JRE combination. The key is to keep working on the code (typing, copying,
pasting,...)

The severity is set to "blocker" because from user point of view, the above
specified build is unusable.

Do you have anything in the log?
This might be a configuration problem: SWT wants a specific GTK version. Please
check whether this is the case in regarding this bug.

Tom, can you reproduce this bug and also provide hints which GTK version is
required by SWT.

As to Kai-Uwe's question about the content of the log file. I have seen some 
exceptions there but I'm not sure if those were related to the problems. If you 
have absolutely no luck reproducing any of the specified problems on your 
systems(it would be very strange since the problems occur all the time on my 
two machines), I can reproduce it and provide you with what ever info you need.

As to Daniel's question.
The version of the gtk package installed on my Linux box is 1.2.10-552. 
If this version of GTK is found improper for the SWT used in build 1119, then 
the bug for the SWT should be that it does not inform about usage of improper 
version of GTK.
Ok... trying to sieve out the problems:

Tomas, what I20031119er build are you using - there have been three rebuilds
yesterday?

1. Have you checked whether you still have "Smart Insert" mode on (type Inset
once or twice to toggle input modes). If you are in raw mode, no autoindentation
will be done.

2. This is a known problem on Linux (see bug 26153) but now also shows if smart
tab is on (bug 46627).

3. / 4. Cannot reproduce this - have you checked your keybindings in the
preferences->Workspace->Keys? Modified the set of keybindings or set emacs mode
or any of that sort? We have worked on the latest 1119er build all day without
seeing this on either WinXP and Linux RH9.

5. ?? Have never used this option at all and don't see what influence it would
have on running eclipse. Please explain.

Relevant for eclipse is the GTK2 version, it should be 2.2, although some people
have reportedly run without problems under 2.4.

I am using GTK 2.2 (gtk2-2.2.1-4 on Redhat 9.0)


Please attach the log to this PR. Thanks!
Kai-Uwe, I'll delete the log file, start the Eclipse, use it until the problems 
occur and attach the new log file. 
Is there any other file or other info I can provide you with to help you debug ?
Have you attempted or have you been sucessful in reproducing any of the 
problems so far ?
We have tested the latest build on Win, Linux, Mac the whole day (Europe). We 
haven't seen anything similar to what you report. Others (Americas) are 
testing right now.  
Still, we don't have any reported problem alike. Tom asked a couple of 
questions. Any answers? Do you have a new log? Thanks.
Sorry for responding so late, here are my answers:
1. I have the smart insert on, and without switching it off, the indentation 
behaviour changed. However, yesterday I have been using only my Linux machine, 
and it did not occur there at all. I'll be using my Windows machine most of the 
day today so I will report as soon as it occurs.
3., 4. Did not occur yesterday either(on Linux).
5. The option -Djava.compiler=NONE has been recommended to me by Eclipse team 
after I have reported problem in M3 when Eclipse was running into 
NullPointerExceptions. The reason was that there is a bug in JIT which is 
causing this.

Because yesterday only problem #2 has occured and there was no log produced, I 
will lower the severity and will report back as soons as other problems occur 
and I have a log file for you.

Tom, Kai-Uwe, what JRE (vendor&version) are you using and what JRE is being 
used for testing?
I have used sun's JDK 1.4.2_01 for Linux, and an IBM provided 1.4.1 vm.
Tom,
here is the full version of my IBM 141 JRE:
java full version "J2RE 1.4.1 IBM Windows 32 build cn141-20030522"
can you provide yours ? 

I will run the Eclipse today without the -Djava.compiler=NONE and attach the 
log when it hits the NullPointerException.
vendor id on Linux is: build 1.4.1, J2RE 1.4.1 IBM build cxia321411-20031011
Tom,
I have just downloaded the latest released IBM JDK and the full version on 
Linux is:
"J2RE 1.4.1 IBM build cxia321411-20030930"
It seems that your build of JRE is a newer one.
I wonder if you are using the released version or some "early access" version. 
If what you have is a released one, can you let me know where to download it 
from ? I have been downloading my JDK builds from Hursley Java Information hub.

I forgot to add following info:
The version of Eclipse I use on Linux is the Motif version.
The I1119 build is the very first one, the one that passed bvt on all platforms.
I cannot reproduce any of the mentioned issues on either GTK or Motif. Tomas, do
you still see this on your Windows box as well?

Otherwise, I would assume it is a specific problem of your Linux configuration.
Please try to reproduce with a stable build (i.e. M5 when it is out) with a
fresh install and new workspace. Any hand-knit kernel extras, new thread
libraries etc?

There is a page on the eclipse download site which points you to recent JRE
downloads.
After updating my JRE to the latest IBM JRE available, the problems do not 
occur on builds I1119 or M5.
