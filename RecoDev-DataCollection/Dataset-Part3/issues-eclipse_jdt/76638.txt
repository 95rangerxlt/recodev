Having the following class:
public class MultipleCaller {
	public void caller() {
		callee(1);
		callee(2);
		callee(3);
	}
	private void callee(int i) {
	}
}
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Call Hierachy on callee(int).
2. Mark "caller()" entry in "Members" pane
3. "Call" pane show three entries
4.a. Mark one of the entries in "Call" pane.
5.a. Invoke "Copy" (<Ctrl>-<C>)
6.a. Clipboard contains following: "caller()" (Marking of "Members" pane was copied)

Additionally:
4.b. Mark two (or three) entries in "Call" pane
5.b. Invoke "Copy" (<Ctrl>-<C>)
6.b. Clipboard contains following: 
caller()
caller()
(Marking of "Members" pane was copied as often as number of lines you marked in
"Call" pane)

Maybe the first one (a.) is a feature request: "Support copy in Call Hierarchy
Call pane".
But the second (b.) is a real bug.

It looks like that only the members pane correctly retargets the copy action. 

Not critical for 3.1.
Can this be considered for 3.3?

Thanks.
Fixed.
