Javadoc view unnecessarily reloads doc if input has not changed. Moving the caret inside the same element in a CU editor reloads the view all the time.

Updating on equal elements should either be turned off like in the Declaration view (just remove JavadocView#isIgnoringEqualInput()), or it should be made smarter and only update if the caret is inside a javadoc region.

Fixed in HEAD by checking (if possible) in which partition the selection offset is.
