- switch the Package Explorer in working set grouping mode
- create some working sets
- select a working set and open the context menu

we have a 'Configure Working Set..' and Properties.
Properties does nothing. I think it would make sense to remove 'Configure Working Set..' and offer this in the property page.
(Platform might want to take over this code)

What do they want to take over? The WizardPropertyPage? The action is contributed by JDT/UI. The Project Explorer does not have a context action to configure workingsets. Once they fix bug 200316 they will get the property page for free.


> What do they want to take over?
The WorkingSetPropertyPage including the plugin XML contribution (adding a property page for all elements of type IWorkingSet)

The 'Properties..' action is from platform.ui PropertyDialogAction) and every view could and should offer it in the context menu. (Its also in the File menu)
Looks like a bug that the project explorer only shows it for IResource.

Kim, what do you think?

I see, code is ready to be pushed down. See org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.preferences.WorkingSetPropertyPage and its superclass.


Seems like a good idea.  I dont suppose you have time to whip up a patch do you? :)

No, I don't know enough about eclipse/ui (i.e. in which plugin to contribute the property page). But take this patch for a start. I hope that helps.
Reopen, should adopt platform API and get rid of our implementation.
