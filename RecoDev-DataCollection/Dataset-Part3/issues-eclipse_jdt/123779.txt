The JAR importer does not import the contents from the JAR into the workspace. This is unexpected.

I'd change this to JAR Updater.

The JAR importer does not import the contents from the JAR into the workspace. This is unexpected.

I'd change this to JAR Updater.
In order to be consistent with the remaining actions (Replace with... and Buildpath -> Replace with new Jar file) I changed this to Replace JAR file.
