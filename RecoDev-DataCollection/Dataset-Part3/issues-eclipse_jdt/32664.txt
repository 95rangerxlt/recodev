- initially 'flat layout' is used, 'link with editor' is on or off
- open a java file
- use 'collapse all' in the package explorer
- select 'hierarchical layout'
- switch 'link with editor' on or off&on -> no back-linking

Can't reproduce. Christof do you have a easy case to reproduce it. 
I can reproduce it if I use 'collapse all' prior to switching to hierarchical

Is related to bug 33252
Problem was the the delegating content provider returned null for parents of a 
package fragment root.

Fixed for RC2.
