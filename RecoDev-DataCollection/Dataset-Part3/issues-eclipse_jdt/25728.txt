Steps:
1) Add a field to some class then use source->add getters and setters to add 
getter and setter methods.
2)delete the new field and rebuild.
Note: that while the code assist light bulbs appear next the the getter and 
setter methods no error tick is shown. Is this intentional? Error ticks 
however appear in other views, outline, package explorer, tasks, etc. I would 
expect to see them in the editor too.

Error ticks appear for a second then go away. This only happens in the editor's
vertical ruler and not for all errors which have light bulbs.


note: if I turn quick fix light bulb off for vertical ruler then the error ticks
come back.

Replacing the problem icon with the light bulb is intentional. However it also
confused me and I loose the information whether it is an error or a warning.

There should be an error and a warning light bulb.


Changing summary.
