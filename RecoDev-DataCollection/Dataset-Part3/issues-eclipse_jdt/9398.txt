I forgot the [][] after double
Try to move your mouse about integer inside the method.
Try to compile this class.

public class CompilerError {
	/**test*/
	int integer = 0;

	public void test() {
		double size = { {}, {}};
		System.out.println(integer );
	}
}

Thanks ! We had a bug in the error reporting code (trying to compute the leaf 
type of the array initializer).

Will be in next integration build.
Fixed.
