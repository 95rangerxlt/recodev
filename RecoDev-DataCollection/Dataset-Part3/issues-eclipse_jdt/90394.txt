3.1M6. Create new project, new class, new junit test for that class. Eclipse
asks to add junit.jar to the classpath, say OK. Right click junit.jar, click
Java Source Attachment. An error says the path does not exist. Here's what is
filled in:

ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.source_3.0.0/src/org.junit_3.8.1/junitsrc.zip

Changing the path to 3.1.0 manually fixes it. (although the error message
persists until I switch to another tab and come back, that may be another bug).

You may want to define another classpath variable like JDT_SOURCE or something
to prevent this kind of problem in the future.

Quick fix is to update the string to 3.1.0.
Fixed.
