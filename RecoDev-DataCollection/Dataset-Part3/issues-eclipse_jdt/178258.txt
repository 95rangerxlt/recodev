- In the Java editor hover over a element, wait for the hover and press F2
- While the sticky hover is open move the mouse over symbols in the Java editor
- When over an element that would give a hover, the cursor flickers: I guess it quickly shows the busy cursor but then decides to not show a hover as there's already one open. It might be better to test this before showing the busy cursor.

This is in since a few releases. Will see durng M7 whether there's an easy fix.
There are two problems here:
1) we compute the hover even though we wouldn't need to. This is a conceptual
   problem as we compute the hover in a bg thread and if we have a
   result we try to display it in the UI thread. At this point we first setup
   the control (content, size, location) and only if that all works well we 
   request the widget token (i.e. check whether another hover is up).

2) setting the content to the invisible Browser widget causes the cursor to
   flicker.

Changing the widget token story for 3.3 is too risky as this might result in either hovers no longer showing up or having two hovers at the same time. Regarding 2) we can't do much.

Deferring to 3.4.
This has been fixed by Markus's rich hover work.
