The JDT APT web site at http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/apt/index.html is horribly out of date: e.g., it refers to the latest version of Eclipse as 3.2 M5.  (Not even M5eh.)

It should be updated, and should include information on writing Java 6 processors.  A link to the 2007 EclipseCon APT tutorial would be helpful; or, more ideally, that tutorial should be rewritten as an Eclipse Corner article.

APT site is migrated to Phoenix

APT site is migrated to Phoenix. Old html pages are updated to redirect to the new php pages. No content is updated.
Created attachment 223428
links are updated

Links are updated to simplify local testing of the JDT site and make it more environment agnostic.
Walter, would you find some time to review this?
Note that the JDT website repos on CVS are now read-only and not in use any more.

The active website is on Git:
ssh://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/www.eclipse.org/jdt.git
It's been five years since this bug was reported.
Walter doesn't seem to be actively involved anymore.
Can anybody else review my changes. It's nothing content related just migration to Phoenix.
Apologies. It is true that I'm not actively involved, but I do still try to at least review contributions, and this very welcome one fell off my radar.  I'll look it over between now and Christmas.  Thanks again for your attention to it.

No problem. Now I feel sorry for taking your time during the holidays.
It's just my second patch to OS project so I was a bit disappointed about it is not being reviewed. 
Thank you in advance.

No need to feel guilty!  The holidays are the only time that I get to work on Eclipse.
These changes are fine.  I still need to make the content changes :-(

Now, how to commit them?

Unfortunately I don't remember how exactly I created the patch :( but I did it with EGit as described here - http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Patches
Either Eclipse's 'Team - Apply Patch' or 'git apply' command should work.
And than regular git workflow - commit and push.

I can commit the patch if you want. But now that we are pointing to index.php, which doesn't exist, it needs to go with the content changes as well.

I have a question on the patch, though. Why aren't you using the page relative path in the _projectCommon.php like you are doing in index.php. I would prefer the "apt/index.php" than "/jdt/apt/index.php".

I don't mind if Walter doesn't.

Navigation menu which is built in the _projectCommon.php is displayed on all the pages which makes relative path unusable because it'll point to existing page only from index.php and overview.php in root of the project.

That makes sense. Thanks for explaining!
Jayaprakash, if you're properly set up with Git, it would be great if you can commit the patch. My machine isn't correctly set up yet to commit to the Eclipse git repos...
It looks like I don't have the permission to push into this repository. I will try to get the permissions sorted and attempt again.

What did you try?

You should have access to:
www/jdt/apt
www/jdt/core

But not the top-level: 
www/jdt/

Please prepare a patch for wwww/jdt so that I can commit it.

This is the repo I am trying to push the changes to:
 ssh://jarthanaree@git.eclipse.org/gitroot/www.eclipse.org/jdt.git

Even excluding those outside 'apt' didn't help. I don't even see www anywhere in the repository content. Is there another way to access these files?

Sorry, we're in Git now ;-). When we migrated, we decided to get rid of the per-component access control and instead have one JDT repo for the website where all JDT committers have write access. There was a bug with the update hook which I fixed now. You should be able to push all the changes.

Thanks, Dani! I have pushed all the changes now.
Walter, would you like to add more content changes? Or can I close this bug?
