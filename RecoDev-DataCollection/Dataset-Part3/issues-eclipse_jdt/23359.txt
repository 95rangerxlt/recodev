Eclipse R201

Selected the whole body of a method and pressed CTRL + / to comment. The UI 
froze for a few seconds, the editor was marked as dirty (* in its title) but 
the contents disappeared. It was OK on disk but instead of the Java editor 
I've got a gray editor area. Attaching log file.

Any special cases? Bidi or something else?
No and it was the only time I've got it.
Inspected code and found a case in which the first of the stack traces could be 
produced. Fixed. Build > 20021008.
