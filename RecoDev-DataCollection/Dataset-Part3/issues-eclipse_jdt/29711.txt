let's try for m5
workbench action is broken too
see bug 30294
eclipse.ui action is broken so i could not treat it as a reference
i looked at ms file explorer and did what it does:

- the overwrite dialog says 'exists and is read-only' 
 or 'exists', depending if it is r-o or not

- if you say 'yes to all' on a _non_ read-only file (eg. A.txt) and then a r-o 
one comes (B.txt), you get asked for another confirmation
(you _do not_ get asked if you say 'yes to all' on a read-only file)

the only diff between this and ms explorer is that they ask before each file is 
copied, and we ask once upfront

what is true for files, is also true for all sorts of folders (3) and all kind 
of files (2)
