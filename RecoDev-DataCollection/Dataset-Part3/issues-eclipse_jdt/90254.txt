- Create class aaa.AAA:
package aaa;
public class AAA {
	BBB b;
}

- With the New Class Wizard, create class bbb.BBB, and set modifier to default
*in the wizard* (not manually in the code afterwards).
- Go to aaa.AAA and execute Organize Imports
-> No import for BBB is added (which is +/- OK, since BBB is not visible).

- Now make BBB public and save.
- Go to aaa.AAA and execute Organize Imports.
-> No import for BBB is added.
-> Expected: import is added now that BBB is public. I guess the problem is that
the AllTypesCache stores BBB's modifiers but doesn't update them.

The problem is that we cache the modifiers in the all types cache. If we get rid
of it, then there is no further action needed. If not, then the all types cache
listener has to handle modifier changes. However, it shouldn't flush the cache
in the situation. It should update it.
This is a all-types cache problem. The element change listener should also react
on modifier changes.

I just changed organize import to not use the all-types cache anymore (an new
search is now performed to look up unknown types) > 20050405
Since the all types dialog doesn't show modifier information updating the cache
in this situation isn't necessary. Additionally we still hope that the cache is
going away anyways.

Marking as fixed since the organize import case got fixed.
