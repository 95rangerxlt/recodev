If I type:
public void foo(){
  doInternalFoo()<<CODE ASSIST>>
}

It would be nice to have the completion suggest Inserting a skeleton for that 
method into the current class, provided that there are no other completion 
proposals.

It could even add a "transient" todo item to remind me to implement that 
method.  By transient, I mean that marker would go away once I close the editor.

Use Quick fix on 'doInternalFoo', it offers a 'Create method'
