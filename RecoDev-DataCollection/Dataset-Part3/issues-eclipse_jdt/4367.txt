- enter the following code
public class A {
	public int foo(int x, int y) {
		return 1;
	}
	
	public void bar() {
	}
}
- now enter
public void bar() {
    foo<= code assist
}
- select foo(int x, int y)
- observe: argument hover is correct
- now type foo again
- open code assist
- select foo(...)
- type 10, 10 and cursor left
- argument hover disappears although outer method call isn't finihed yet.

Implemented a stacked model. I.e. nested activations are possible, the outer 
argument hover is reactivated when the inner context is left. Build > 20011217.
