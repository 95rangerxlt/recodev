3.0

The AST view example bundle has two bugs:
- it is not a plug-in but a .jar with plugin and source, see:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-home/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.astview/AST-View-Site/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.astview_1.0.0.jar
- it has not leading directory (e.g. org.eclipse.jdt.astview) and hence I have
to manually add it when unzipping or my target folder gets polluted
