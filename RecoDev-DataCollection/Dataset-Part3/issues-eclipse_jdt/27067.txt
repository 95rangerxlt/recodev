Work for me using 20021119. Do you have a reproducable case for this. How does 
your setup look like. I suspect that your build path setup is incorrect or that 
the rt.jar isn't on your build path since we dind't change anything in this 
area for a while.
I had the problem a few times today, but now it's gone. Maybe because I
restarted Eclipse inbetween. Cannot reproduce it, so I close the bug.

rt.jar should be correct.
