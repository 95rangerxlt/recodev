Method refactorings (change signature, pull up, push down) should support
Participants.
Fair request.

Since M6 is API freeze this has to wait until > 3.1
Talking with Vikas, it is not critical. Still nice to have.
Reopening. Need further assessment.
Any word on what version this might be planned for? We have a problem handling method sig refactorings because of this which affects some other usecases.
I think this will be a 2-3 week effort (1/2 milestone) as it involves changes to several refactorings
- new API
- allow participants to change method signature, introduce parameter, introduce parameter object

At the moment we have no time allocated for this in 3.4
added to the 3.4 plan
I starting to work now on participants for change method signature. pull up are push down are not related (they would rather be a move) and are not planed for 3.4.

Vikas, if you have additional information on what is requested and how it will be used by you, I'd be happy if you can add some comments.

Martin, the primary requirement at this point is to have the ability to handle move, rename and change method signature refactorings. We expect our participants to respond to these refactorings by modifying our artifacts that reference methods.

Your comments indicate that move won't be contained in 3.4. Is that right?
Move participants are already supported for the following moves:
- move resources
- move source folder
- move package fragments
- move compilation units and class files
- move types
- move static methods

No participants for:
- move instance method (bug 86438) (note that move instance method only allows you to move to one of the parameter types)
- pull up/ push down 

The new support for 3.4 will add participants to:
- change method signature
- introduce parameter
- introduce parameter object

We haven't planed to add more that this for 3.4 as there hasn't been many requests for adding more participants. Speak up if you need this too. As mentioned above, this is non-trivial work that we need to plan ahead.

I released the support for change method signature participants.

- New extension point 'changeMethodSignatureParticipants' in plug-in 'org.eclipse.jdt.core.manipulation'
- New API ChangeMethodSignatureParticipant to be implemented by contributors
- New API ChangeMethodSignatureArguments to describe refactoring changes
- New API JavaParticipantManager to get all participants

Vikas, I'd be happy if you could have a look at the API to see if it fits your needs. Thanks!

fixed for M4
As explained in comment 8, this bug only fixes participants for change method signature. Please file new bugs for other participants.
