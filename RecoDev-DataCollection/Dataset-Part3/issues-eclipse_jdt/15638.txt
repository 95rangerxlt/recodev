If I move a file from the packages view using drag & drop, the packages view
does not update to show that the file has been removed.

After I refresh the packages view shows the file is no longer there.

package viewer problem
shows up only if you move files outside of the workbench
DND gave me DROP_TARGET_MOVE - some new thing the drag adapter's never seen 
before.
fix is trivial - but need to wait for VI to explain what that thing does
fixed - simple ui update was needed after DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE
Adam, could you explain why the viewer didn't just update in response to the 
workspace change?
Confirmed it's still a problem in the Navigator in 0508.

Reopened wrong PR.
Verified.
