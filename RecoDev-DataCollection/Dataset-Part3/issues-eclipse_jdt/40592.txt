Currently, if you do an "add import" for a fully-qualified class, the import is
added and the full-qualification is removed.  (ie/the package part of the class
name is removed).  If you do the same to another usage of the same class,
nothing happens.  It would be very helpful to have the package part of the class
name removed for any class that has an existing import when doing an add import.
