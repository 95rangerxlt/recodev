i have a (library) project Refactoring Tests Resources
and other projects org.eclipse....

before 205 they used to be sorted alphabetically
now they're not.
is that intentional?

before, project names were sorted non case sensitive.
I couldn't see why.
Java elements normally are case sensitive.

I can change that back. Comments?
we should be consistent with the Navigator. If the Navigator sorts in case 
insensitive way then we should do the same.
