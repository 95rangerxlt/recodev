There is currently an internal API for sending custom JDWP commands via JDIDebugTarget#sendJDWPCommand(...). This should become offical API and in addition, there should be an API to refresh the debug model state.

For example, a custom JDWP command/event could change the target's state, and the Java debug model state as presented in the UI is no longer up to date. Clients need to be able to programmatically request a full model refresh when this occurs.

Updated patch that deals with target suspend/resume state as well as thread state.
Released patch to HEAD.
Marking fixed, as the code is in HEAD. However, feedback from API consumers is still required. New bugs can be opened as required.
