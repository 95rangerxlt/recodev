the filter language for the build path inclusion filters is not obvious:

- the filter says it is used to include packages and types, so I would expect
that my filter expression must match 'com.example.Test'. Instead, it must match
'com/example/Test.class'.
- in the add-dialog, the only hint that Ant-style wildcards are supported is the
** example - more examples should be given, as with the source folder filter
dialogs.

- the order of inclusion>exclusion is not obvious except for their order on the
property page. The filter dialog should contain a explanatory note, or the
filters should be reoderable. (Same for source folder filters).

TypeRestrictionEntryDialog.include.description=Enter a pattern to specify the
packages and types to be included in the classpath entry. Allowed wildcards are
'*', '?' and '**'. '*' includes all packages or types on the same level, '**'
includes subpackages as well. Package segments are separated by the slash
character, e.g 'java/util/*'. This feature is work in progress.
