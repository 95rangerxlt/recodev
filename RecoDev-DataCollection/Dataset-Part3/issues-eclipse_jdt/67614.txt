I wrote the following method call:

  assertEquals(1.0d, blah(), delta);

The field "delta" is not yet declared. I press Ctrl-1 and select "create 
field". The resulting line is:

  private Object delta;

By typing the following sequence of keys:

  [Tab] double [Tab] [Right] = 0.0001d

I change that manually to:

  private double delta = 0.00001d;

Surprisingly, my original method call is now changed to:

  assertEquals(1.0d, blah(), delta = 0.00001d);

And that is of course wrong.

(BTW, I believe that the Ctrl-1 aid should guess the expected field type, but 
that's a different issue.)
