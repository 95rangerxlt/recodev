When I write a exit policy as below, the equal characer is first applied and
then the liked mode is left. It should first leave the linked mode.

public ExitFlags doExit(LinkedModeModel model, VerifyEvent event, int offset,
int length) {
  if (event.character  == '=') {
    return new ExitFlags(ILinkedModeListener.EXIT_ALL, true);
  }
  return null;
}

cool: we now also have a "liked" mode ;-)

Sounds reasonable to me.
