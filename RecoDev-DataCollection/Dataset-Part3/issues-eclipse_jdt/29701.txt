when i create a new method with quick fix it always adds 4 or so empty lines 
after the method
major for me - i use this feature every 5 minutes or so sometimes 
(hardly ever create methods in any other way) 
and having to delete 4 lines everytime is a big pain
The existing spacing of other methods in the same CU is probed and reused.
Reopen if this is not the case.
it is not the case - i have spaces of 1 line between methods
Please add your code so I can test this.
Or write a test case.
here's a test (it seems that qf takes a max of lines between any 2 consecutive 
methods or something)

package dfdf;
public class A {
	void baz(){
	}

//	void commentedOut(){
//		//some code
//		//some code
//	}
	
	void baz0(){
	}

	void foo(){
		bar();
	}
}
