It is not clear for the user that the SETTING of the Javadoc location for the
project "JUnit" is concerned. I'm in the export wizard and generate JDoc. When
saw "update" and "location" I was first thinking of the CONTENT being updated.

When I started to write the PR I understood the dialog.

which dialog are you referring to?
The dialog comes up if you generate Javadoc for a project where the external
Javadoc location is differnt form the location entered in the wizard.

The dialog warns the user about this fact and asks if the external Javadoc
location for the project should be changed.

we could change it to:
Do you want to update the Javadoc location setting for \'\'{0}\'\' with the 
chosen destination folder \'\'{1}\'\'?
It already appears to follow MA's suggestion. fixed. JRT.
