Eclipse 3.2 RC5:

In 3.2, the launch configuration dialog can filter closed projects.

For example, if you have some closed java project, and the option "Filter Closed Projects" is checked, then it won't appear in the list.

However, this does not work for junit launchs. If I have some junit launcher configured for a closed project, it keeps appearing in the list.

Will have to wait for 3.3
I think this is due to a missing ResourceMapping (bug 138910).
The same is true for external tools Ant Build configurations
Fixed with the fix for bug 138910.

> The same is true for external tools Ant Build configurations

In the code, it looks like this should work in 3.3M1.
Please file a new bug against Platform/Ant if it doesn't.
