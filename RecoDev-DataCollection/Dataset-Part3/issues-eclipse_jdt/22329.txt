The icon displayed for jar file entries is not always correct. I am supplying
the following to demonstrate the problem:
1. test.plugin.zip - This is a plugin that defines several default text editors
with unique icons for particular file names. Extract it into the eclipse/plugins
directory.
2. IconJarTest.zip - This is a sample project which can be unzipped into your
workspace directory.

When you look at the project, you will see that the abc.xml and def.xml files in
the MyFiles folder have unique icons (as defined by the plugin). However, if you
expand the iconTest.jar file, def.xml has the same icon as abc.xml. If you open
the two files in the jar though, the icon displayed in the editor tab is
actually correct. I have seen a case where the editor tab icons are incorrect (a
generic file icon appears rather than either of the specific icons), but have
yet to be able to reproduce that particular problem.
