Using 0218, I cannot attach source which is contained in a folder to an external
jar.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new java project
2) Add a new external jar to its classpath
3) Try to attach a folder as a source attachement.
The dialog tells you that you can attach a jar, a zip or a folder, but the
browse file system doesn't allow you to select a folder name. Clicking on 'Open'
opens the directory and doesn't select its name.
The workaround is to type the path in the text field directly. This is
frustrating and is not consistent with the UI message.

This got addressed for build I20030220.
