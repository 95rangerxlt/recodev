Given individual import statements that are longer than the allowed source code
line length, "Format" breaks those up into multiple lines at the "." characters
in the package/class names. "Source/Organize Imports" undoes those changes.

This is related to bug 7224.
Should "Organize imports" use the formatter? Maybe this should be considered 
post 2.0.
Consider this situation:

You imported source code from somewhere and want to be able
to exchange reasonably small patch files with that somewhere.

In this situation, you don't "own" the source code format
and must not change it.

Contributors to open source projects frequently encounter this situation.

If "organize imports" would format the entire file, that'd be a bug.
You'll have to use the formater on part of the file only,
namely, only the import statements.
Organize import recreates the whole import statement section according to your 
settings. Formatting options are not considered. Post 2.0
We should only format the new import statements. All already existing import 
statements should be left untouched.


fixed > 20020924

import structure (add import / org.import) now uses the formatter for newly 
added imports.
