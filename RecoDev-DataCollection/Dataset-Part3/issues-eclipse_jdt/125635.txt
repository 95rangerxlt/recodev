Using SDK-I20060125-0800, I see

%annotationProcessingName
%factoryPathName

Not sure how long they've been there .. but would hate to see them slip into M5 :) 

I suspect '&' instead of '%' was intended in  plugin.xml file?

Forget my remark about & and % (I have a poor memory for such things). 

All looks ok in head ... so, either fixed already, or an obsure bug related 
to switching between 1.4 and 1.5? 


Walter, could you verify this is working correctly?
There does seem to be something quite wrong with these keys in I20060125-0800; in addition to the keys showing up wrong in Window->Preferences, I don't see them at all in Project->Properties.  HEAD appears to be fine, though.

These strings used to not be localized, so when APT first made it into the Eclipse build a couple days ago, we ran up against a bunch of chkpii warnings, and worked through them gradually.  Evidently I20060125-0800 caught some interim state, though I'm not sure how or what.
Followup: the problem was actually not fixed, but now I think that it is.  Problem was that our build.properties didn't include the plugin.properties file; so when built by releng, the plugin didn't contain the localized string values.  I've checked in a corrected build.properties, and hopefully we'll be good in the next nightly.
