Our plugins have their own set of preference pages. If someone press the apply 
button, some settings are performed and some Java classpath variables are 
set/updated.

If someone has opened (instanciated) the Java classpath variable preference 
page before, then modified our page, then pressed apply, and then reselect it, 
its internal model is not updated. It still contains the old classpath 
variables.

The Platform's path variable has excactly the same problem. I have to close and 
reopen the preferences dialog to see the new values.

see also bug 54788
there is code in the Java classpath variable preference page that updates the
variables with the latest values when the page becomes visible. new variables
are not added. Is that what you mean?
Not really. Our preference page configures several variables. If someone opens 
the Java classpath preference page and then our page and then updates our 
page, the variables are updated if he clicks "apply" in our page. If he then 
switches back to the Java classpath preference page without closing the 
dialog, the classpath variables still show the old values. If I then close the 
pref. dialog with "Cancel" and open it again, the new values are visible.

Maybe this has been fixed meanwhile in 3.0 but at least in our 2.1.2 the 
variables are not updated.
