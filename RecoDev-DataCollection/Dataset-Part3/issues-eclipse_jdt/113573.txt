N20051021-linux-gtk + patches from bug 113104

- open the quick outline
- from the view menu choose to remember size & position
- move the popup down, say 50px
- dismiss the popup
- reopen the popup

> expected: the popup opens at the same location as it was moved to previously
< actual: the popup opens further up

-> perhaps this is a relative/absolute coordinate translation problem?

I believe this to be a problem with an incomplete integration of the PopupDialog and the 
AbstractInformationControl.  There is still code in AbstractInformationControlManager that stores the 
bounds and size on its own, and uses the #setLocation API to set the shell bounds.  This will circumvent 
the mechanisms used in PopupDialog.

I verified this by commenting out the code inside setLocation and setSize in AbstractInformationControl 
to do nothing.   (I originally assumed these methods would have to be retained because I was worried 
about preserving AbstractInformationControl API).  With the code commented out, the size and bounds 
are correctly preserved and restored by the PopupDialog code.

Since you mentioned in bug #113104 that you intend to replace abstract information control with a 
popup dialog implementation, I think this problem will go away when that is done.  I didn't feel it was 
worth patching AbstractInformationcontrolManager to fix this when the code is going to be refactored.

Moving this bug back to Tom. 
See also PopupDialog#adjustBounds() which is the hook for the bounds to be adjusted prior to dialog 
opening.  This hook may be needed in order for the control manager to set the location the first time 
(and in cases where bounds are not preserved).


will do this after M3.
fixed. AbstractInformationControl now doesn't implement
IInformationControlExtension3 any longer, as the persistence mechanism is
handled by PopupDialog.

We still update the location if persisting is not enabled, in order to retain
the location computation logic for the initial size: the popup is centered over
the editor area, not the parent shell.

Now, when persisting of bounds is enabled, the location will be persisted
relative the parent shell, vs. in absolute coordinates as up to now - however, I
think this suits the intention better than the previous behavior.
