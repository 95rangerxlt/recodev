Thomas, can you remove this.

Jerome, has this (printing "Search...") been changed recently in the Search
infrastructure? As far as I can remember this was not the case before.

No, but the timing has changed, that's why we're seeing it now.
Is this changed timing stable? Otherwise we might end-up in seeing no
"Searching..." at all.

Yes, we always print the 'Searching...' message.
