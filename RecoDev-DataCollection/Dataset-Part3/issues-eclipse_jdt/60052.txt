Did The undo/redo refactoring actions disppaer ? I tried different refactorings,
the actions never appear in the refactoring menu.
They got moved into a different action set and I am investigating with 
Platform if there are ways to bring the action back programatically.

In the meantime you can either enable the action set (Refactoring - General) 
by hand or close and reopen the perspective.
I reverted the action set back and everything should work again.
