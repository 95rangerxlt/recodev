Build 20020319

In 1.4 compliant mode, I should not be allowed to set source 1.4 with another 
target than 1.4.
please explain again:

if compatibility 1.4 -> source 1.4 -> classfile comp 1.4 ?
Compliance 1.4
 --> if Source 1.4 --> Target 1.4

fixed > 20020328

Note that now setting 1.4 compatibility forces the settings of all other 3 
preferences. There's no real 'Use customized settings'

removed the validation that compl 1.4 -> source 1.4
20020328
note that this rule was specified in bug 11240
sorry, I'm wrong, bug 11240 did not specify this.
everthing is fine
