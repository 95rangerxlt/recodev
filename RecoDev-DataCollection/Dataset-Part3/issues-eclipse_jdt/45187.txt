Rurn on "Show members in Package Explorer" 

Using EclipsePlugin as an example class name, when double clicking on a method 
in that class, like getDefault, getDefault is selected in the editor, but the 
highlight in the package explorer jumps to EclipsePlugin instead of remaining 
on getDefault. 

This is the behavior if "Link with editor" is turned on. If it is turned off, 
the highlight doesn't jump.
