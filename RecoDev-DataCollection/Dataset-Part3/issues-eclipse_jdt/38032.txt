When navigating source using CTRL+Left/Right arrow I find that it would be
useful if the cursor moved to the 'internal word' boundaries in Java
class/field/method names.

For Example (|) denotes cursor position:

... |myJavaThing = ...

repeated CTRL+Right Arrow moves the cursor like this:

... my|JavaThing = ...
... myJava|Thing = ...
... myJavaThing |= ...
