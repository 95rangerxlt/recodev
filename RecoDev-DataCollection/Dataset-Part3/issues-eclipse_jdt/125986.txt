When letting the Cleanup Wizard run over sourcecode that is under version control. (ClearCase SCM Adapter, in our case) the Cleanup Wizard fails, as the files are read only.

Other dialogs (Like find and replace) automatically prompt the user to check out the file

Benno, you can test this with the plugin org.eclipse.team.example.filesystem

- Create a project and use Team > Share Project, Pessimistic...
- Created som code in project, select files and do Team > add to control and Team > checkin
- On the preference page configure 'Prompt to checkout'
- Open a file and type in it: Prompt

The same has to happen for all files modified by clean up. I would think that the refactoring infrastructure would to this. Quick fix does it in CUCorrectionProposal.performValidateEdit
Simpler way to test is by making the file read-only before doing the operation. It should behave like e.g. using 'Organize Imports' i.e. ask whether to make the read-only file writable.

Thanks Dani and Martin. Organize import does make the check and shows an error dialog but it does not ask if the files should be checked out. I've fixed that too. Now both actions do make the check and ask for checking out the files.

Maybe it whould be a good idea to abstract this code and use it for all our actions which manipulate files.
