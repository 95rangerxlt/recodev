The panel for renaming methods has low usability.  The old names for the 
parameters are unsorted --- they are not in declaration order or alphabetical 
order.

If the names are not mneumonic (and why would you rename them otherwise) it is 
hard to determine what to rename them to.  That is, should "arg0" be servlet, 
mapping or request?  (I'm tripping across this renaming overloaded Struts 
action methods).

I would suggest:
1) Sort by declaration order
2) Add a column to display the type
3) Merge this and the parameter ordering panel into a single operation

Agree on 1 and 2. Item 3 is still under discussion since if we do so the 
resulting refactoring should be something like change signature.
