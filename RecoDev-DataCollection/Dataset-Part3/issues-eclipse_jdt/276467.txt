Steps To Reproduce:

In a Java editor:

    int a = 1;
    int b = 1;
    int c = 1;
    int d = a + b + c;

Select "a + b" and do quick assist -> Extract to local variable.  The result:

    <snip>
    int a2 = a;
    int d = a2 + b + c;

I'd hoped for "int i = a + b;" which is what I get from the Refactor menu.

More information:
Should be easy to fix. The refactoring implements the more complicated analysis to properly handle extended infix expressions, so the quick assist can just do the the cheap initial tests and then pass on the actual selection range.
