I was intending to paste:

		null,
		true,
		customOptions);

near the end of the unit.
stack trace implies activity in JavaAutoIndentStrategy.smartIndentAfterNewLine.
It gets only called after a single line delimiter has been inserted which you
apparently did not do. This is strange.

- Are you sure you did not press 'return' before you got the dumps?
- Pasting and inserting a new line (with smart paste on) can be expensive since
the current algo searches for matching parenthesis (brackets, braces) that can
be far away. We probably need to cap the search distance there.
I don't think I had pressed the return key, but wouldn't bet to hard on it. The 
pasted code did contain line separators though.

Also, none of the smart editor behavior is enabled in my settings (except for 
close Javadoc comments).

its definitely happening during auto-indentation. I'll try to reproduce.
Note that the org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests project is not public, and lives on 
snz1f. Dirk knows how to access it.
modified the smart pasting (called "pasting for correct indentation" in the
prefs) code to be much faster - can you check whether this solves the problem?

The stack traces point into a different direction, but since you said it was
when pasting, this might still be it (see also bug 49437)
Closing as there have been fixes with smart pasting. please reopen if you still
see this problem.
