Patch to org.eclipse.jdt.ui

Version: 3.4.0
Build id: I20071213-1700

Both the javadoc view and hover are forgetting to close their streams after reading the css file.  This causes a fie handle to 'leak' until the stream is garbage collected.

I have attached a patch that will close the input streams after reading them.  I also changed the string buffer to pre-allocated to 1500 bytes (slightly larger than the css file being loaded) to reduce the amount of garbage created.
