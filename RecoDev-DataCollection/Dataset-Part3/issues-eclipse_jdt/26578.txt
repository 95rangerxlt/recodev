The "Hovers" tab in the Java editor preference page is difficult to use - in
order to bring up the drop-down list to change the selection, you need to type a
key, and it's not at all clear what key to press. The drop-downs for compiler
preferences etc seem to be working fine, so I don't know why the hover ones
aren't. (I confess I haven't looked at the code yet.)

I'm using M3.

Agree. Change hover preference page.

FYI: The compiler preference page has a fixed number of entries while the hovers
are contributed by clients. It primary problem is in the table LAF.
