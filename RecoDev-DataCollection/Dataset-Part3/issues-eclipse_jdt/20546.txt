The 'assert' keyword in J2SE 1.4 doesn't get highlighted as a keyword.
assert is colored as keyword when the compiler preference is set to 1.4 
compliance. When switching this preference editor syntax highlighting behavior 
does not change. It only picks up the setting on start up. Thus, restarting the 
workbench has the effect that assert is correctly colored. This is a 
regression, introduced when splitting core and ui preferences.

Opt for no 2.0 action. ReadMe issue.

This is more problematic with 2.1 because you can have different settings on a 
per project basis, so restarting the workbench is _not_ an option.
need to change update mechanism of VersionedWordRule in JavaCodeScanner.
This is a problem for all per-project settings that affect text representation
(e.g. Task markers are affected as well). Only the global settings are
reflected. Resolving as LATER as this will not be addressed in M4.
Get rid of deprecated state.
Works for me using 3.4 M5.
