First seen in 2.1 RC1

When the code helper pops up for unhandled exceptions, it contains "Add throws 
declaration" and "Surround with try/catch".  The oh-so-useful "Add catch to 
surrounding try" seems to have disappeared.  I couldn't find any setting in the 
preferences that changed this, or any other logged bugs.
