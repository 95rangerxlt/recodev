It doesn't appear to be possible to place $ symbols in templates since they are 
marked as incomplete variables. 

It is possible to use $$ but this isn't useful in a lot of class headers for 
source control systems that use $text$ as place holders as $$ has a different 
meaning.

If you want '$$', you escape each '$' with '$', so you would get '$$$$'. I 
don't see the problem.
Sorry. I should have pointed out that $$ is not resolved to $ as far as I can 
tell. Hence, there is no way of putting a single $ symbol in a template.
I guess you're referring to typecomments and filecomments. See bug 7303. It's 
fixed now.
Verified
I tried to enter the following Template:

//$NON-NLS-1$

I got stuck w/ the error message: "Template has incomplete variables."

Well, I did not want to insert a variable (they have the format ${description});
I just wanted a single $ to appear in the output.

@@@@

I think the error message should state that if you want a single $ to appear in
the editor you have to enter $$.

Right now the information is burried in the docs:
http://dev.eclipse.org:8080/help/content/help:/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tips/tips-2.htm

The new error message would not only state that the input so far is incomplete
but also present one way to remedy the situation.
