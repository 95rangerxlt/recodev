MacOS X doesn't have a single rt.jar but a classes.jar and an ui.jar.
The MacOS X launcher correctly detects this and it can be verified on the "Installed JRE" 
preference page that there are two libraries per JRE.
I20020917.
However when creating a new Java project, not both libraries are added to the project, 
but only the first one: "classes.jar". This works as long as no UI (AWT or Swing) classes 
are used.
If UI classes are used, the user has to go to the "Advanced.." dialog in Properties/Java 
Build Path/Libraries, pick the "JRE System Library" option from the popup-menu and then 
delete the now obsolete JRE_LIB entry. This seems to be not very inuitive for the 
standard case.
Is there a way to enable the library container by default on MacOS X so that both libraries 
are added to a project?

Preference page 'Java->New projects' lets you configure which kind of classpath 
entry is added as JRE entry.
Currently by default it is the JRE variable.

For 2.1 we should set it to JRE container.

If you want to force this for 2.0 and you have a plugin knowing jdt.ui,
modify JDT Ui's preference store and set 
PreferenceConstants.NEWPROJECT_JRELIBRARY_INDEX to 1 (now its 0)
