Often, when I try to use code assist, I am getting index out of bounds errors 
(and code assist fails). Unfortunately, there is no stacktrace in the log. 
Here is the log entry, if it helps. The build is I20030910.

!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.core 4 980 Sep 15, 2003 09:48:19.244

It's not just code assist. I get the exception when typing in certain comments 
as well.
Fixed in HEAD. Build > 20030915.
