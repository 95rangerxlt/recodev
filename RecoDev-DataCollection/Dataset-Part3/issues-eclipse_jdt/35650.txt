i don't think so - short words like this are not capitalized
see 3.49 in http://www.access.gpo.gov/styleman/2000/pdf/chap03.pdf 
ok, i was wrong - short words should be upper case if they're at the beginning 
or end of menu entries and such.
Not critical for 2.1 since we use that style for quite a while.
