If I type:

new ISelectionListener(

and then hit Ctrl+Space, it suggests nothing.  I would like it to suggest 
completing an anonymous implementation of the interface.  Ideally it would 
automatically insert the entire local class declaration, including empty stubs 
for all required methods.  This would save lots of typing!

it works for interfaces in source but not for interfaces in binary classes.
This JCore limitation - moving.

Should not be working anywhere.
