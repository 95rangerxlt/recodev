Build Identifier: Version: 3.7.2 Build id: M20120208-0800

VMDeathEvents returned by the EventQueue never carry the request which triggered them.

This is because EventRequestManagerImpl#addRequestIDMapping(..) doesn't handle VMDeathRequests. The code is just missing.
So when trying to map the request id to the request using EventRequestManagerImpl#findRequest(..), the original request is nowhere to be found.

The same problem is visible in EventRequestManagerImpl#removeRequestIDMapping(..)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a VMDeathRequest
2. enable it
3. associate an IJDIEventListener to the request
4. wait for a callback when the VM terminates
  => it never happens. The VM terminates, the listener is not informed.

The test case is cleaner if step 2 and 3 are reversed.

This would be a good candidate for 3.8.1.

Opened bug 385871 for the backport
