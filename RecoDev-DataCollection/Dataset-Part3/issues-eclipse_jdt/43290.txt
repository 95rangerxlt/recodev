Please add a new option to put <p> on same line as following paragraph. See 
example below.

/**

 * 
 * <p>The header grid has the following characteristics: ...
 * 
 * <p>Note that the class does not enherit from {@link 
com.eliad.swing.extend.JAdvancedGridHeader}
 * because this later class is <code>final</code>.

Currently the <p> is put on an independent line...

Tobias, please comment.
See my comment for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=43286
I use this format myself sometimes. However if we start to configure this tag
we'll end up to offer a preference for every single tag (see bug 43291 ;-).

Maybe we could offer options like:
- [ ] don't touch html tags
-     [ ] opening HTML tags on separate line
-     [ ] closing HTML tags on separate line

Related to bug 43291.
Handling the HTML tags in the proposed generalized way seems clever. 
Unfortunately we would have to agree to a bunch of exceptions, like
<code>,<strong>,<em>,<b>,<i>,<tt>,... , to quote a few. Basically anything that 
only has to do with fonts and not formatting/line wrapping.
We could separate structural tags from formatting tags
If you can separate the structure from the formatting (the weak point of html 
in the first place), and combine with with Daniels comment 3, then I believe 
you can match almost everything with relatively little configuration.

I would expect something like

- [ ] format html tags
-     [ ] preceed opening HTML tags with an empty line
-     [ ] follow closing HTML tags with an empty line
-     [ ] surround other structural HTML tags with empty lines

"opening HTML tags" covers <dl>, <ul>, <table>, <pre>, <quote>,...
"closing HTML tags" covers the </..> counterparts
"other structural HTML tags" covers <p>, <li>, <h1>..<h5> (are they 
allowed?), ...
The issue has been solved as follows:

Since the border between structural tags and formatting tags is rather vage 
(e.g. hx) and therefore no clean solution is possible, two new preferences 
have been introduced:

- Clear all blank lines
- Format HTML tags

By combining these two preferences, the format of comments like the ones above 
is preserved.

Note that Javadoc tags (@param, ...), Javadoc HTML tags (<code>, ...) and tags 
for verbatim text (<pre>,<q>, ...) are formatted independent of the chosen 
settings for HTML tag formatting.
Sounds good. Which version should I test? :-)
These preferences have been introduced with I20030930
