Bug 394356 had to simplify some tests in NullTypeAnnotationTest due to the
spec change from '@NonNull java.lang.Object' to 'java.lang. @NonNull Object'.

I should re-introduce some variance of this kind because the new syntax
forces annotations to be interpreted as type annotations, where until now
the syntax was ambiguous with SE7 annotations.

See also bug 394539.
Meanwhile tests already had some variance in this regard.
I added some more via commit e760e456d0e96ba9bce504014e582b9dbdf7e542
