I20061212-0010, already wrong in M3

'Convert to enhanced for loop' drops additional variable initialization:
'a= init()' is silently removed. Moving the declaration before the for loop would affect the initialization order. I think the quick fix should not appear in this case.

package test1;
public class E1 {
        void foo(Object[] x) {
                for (int j = 0, a= init(); j < x.length; j++) {
                        System.out.println(x[j]);
                }
        }

        private int init() {
            System.out.println("init");
            return 0;
        }
}
