The xml files that contain the listings of context for help and ref topics are a mess and impossbile to find things in, and contain some no longer valid topics.

They should be cleaned up and organized.

xml file patch

this patch is for the xml files, reorganized, cleaned up and somewhat readable (as readable as xml can be)
Created attachment 41337
console images

Also a few changes to the Console view doc are in there and these are the required images. Please extract them to ../images/debug_console_ref/
Applied all except changes to contexts_JDT.xml. Will let JDT UI decide if they want that changed.

patch for JDT contexts
Dani, I'll let your team decide if you want the JDT contexts updated.
In my opinion the patch contains too many changes to be applied at this point. -1 from my side.
Martin?
I suggest we use the patch. There haven't been any changes since the patch was created.
Markus is updating all the context id's, I suggest he decides and releases the patch.
We won't apply the patch to contexts_JDT.xml. We already have pending changes for that file in the patch to bug 122493, and merging them would be a hassle. Furthermore, reviewing the changes is almost impossible, and I don't think the alphabetic sorting is that useful anyway. You have to search for references anyway, so organizing them logically (e.g same order as in the UI) seems to be more useful.
