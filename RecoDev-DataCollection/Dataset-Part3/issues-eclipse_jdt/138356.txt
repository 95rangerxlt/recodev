When converting a loop to an enhanced for loop by quick assist, Eclipse tries to guess a name for the loop variable, and uses "element" if it can't guess one.

It would be nice if the quick assist would start a template mode with the loop variable name being editable - especially in the latter case.

This has been fixed a while ago.
