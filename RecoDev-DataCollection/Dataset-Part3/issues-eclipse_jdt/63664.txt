Hi,

please use the browser to display JavaDoc when hovering over a method, or 
pressing Ctrl-Space. For example netBeans is using the browser in its JavaDoc 
popup. That allows to navigate through the JavaDoc in the displayed popup and 
is very usefull.

I am not very happy with the current approach (M9) to have a seperate view for 
the JavaDoc Browser.

Is this a workbench issue?  Or should this bug be reassigned to Help?
The Javadoc view allows to browse Javadoc without having any editor open.

We had it in but could not release because of focus problems. We also want to
have this feature.

Now that #44008 was fixed ([browser] Browser component grabs focus when loaded),
any chance of getting this feature into Eclipse 3.1?

I've investigated this and - as an experimental feature - will enable the
Browser widget for information presentation (appears if you press F2 either
while the tool tip is up or not). I can not yet implement it for hovers due to
bug 82660.
I've released the code which shows the Browser widget when you press F2.

Hi Daniel,
great to hear that :).

Is there a special reason why the Browser is only used when F2 is pressed and
not as soon as the Hover shows?

Regards,
Ben
There are currently two problems left:

1) we don't want to use a fixed size and let the widget compute the size based
on the given text. This does not yet work well along with the Browser widget: it
is too small.

2) if status text is set the hover automatically closes
Another problem is that Links open inside the popup. They should open outside
Eclipse in an external Browser.

I opened Bug 89091 to cover this issue. Also affects the JavaDoc view.
