With "Prefs -> Java|Editor|Behaviour|Automatically close strings" set to true, 
do the following:

Hit double quote once. You get <code>""</code>, with the cursor between the 
quotes.

Type foo. You get <code>"foo"</code>, with the insert cursor after the 
last 'o'. The foo is underlined in green.

You now have two possibilties. They are:

1) Hit tab. The green line vanishes, and the insert cursor moves to be after 
the closing quote. This is fine

2) Use the cusor keys or click with the mouse to move the insert cusror to 
somewhere else in the file. If we type anything except a tab, the green line 
vanishes, and we get the appropriate character in the place we expect. If we 
hit a tab, the cursor magically flies back to our closing quote, and a tab gets 
inserted. This is bad.

What I think *should* happen is that the green line and thus the tab-based tab-
based behaviour should stop if the user moves the cursor outside the quotes.

This kind of behaviour appears to be true for automatically closed brackets as 
well.
Works for me with 2.1 RC1
No longer jumps. Tab also quits.
