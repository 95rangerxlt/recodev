When I load multiple projects from the repository, I notice that the Navigator
	view is refreshed to contain the new projects at the end of the operation. This
	is presumably due to a notification from Core so the behaviour is expected.

	But I also notice that the Java projects are shown in the Packages view as
	each one is created. Rumour has it this is because JavaElementDeltas are
	being fired after each project is created. Could performance be improved by
	waiting to update after the operation has completed?

NOTES:

EG (5/17/01 10:47:04 PM)
	moving to JCORE for consideration

	The Java model currently lacks a mechanism for queueing up java element deltas,
which is what you would likely need to provide a general solution to this problem.

	Nice to have.

Related to batching Java element deltas
IJavaElementDeltas are now fired during the resource delta processing in one 
batch.
