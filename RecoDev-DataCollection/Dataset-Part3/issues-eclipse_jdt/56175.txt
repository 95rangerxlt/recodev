Deleting in the search view isn't support. Users might be confused what 
deleting means: removing from the list of searches or actually deleteing the 
selected element in the model. As with the old view matches are removed from 
the view via Remove Match or Remove All Matches from the context menu or tool 
bar.


I expect the delete key to remove the match - LIKE IT USED TO.
You are right. It was alway my assumption that delete doesn't work because I 
was scared hitting it since its semantic is.

I agree that we have to do something here to bring the old Search function 
back. My proposal is:

When the user hits delete the first time we show a dialog telling him that 
this removes the match and doesn't delete the element. The dialog has a "Don't 
show this message again" box.

Thomas what do you think
No: popping up the dialog here is and indication that we're not doing the right
thing. Either the delete key makes sense for the operation or not. If it does,
we don't need the dialog. If it doesn't, we shouldn't be using the delete key
(and I'm more than happy to take the abuse from existing users). 
That said I agree that we should have a key binding for "Remove match". Also, we
should be able to remove whole subtrees in the tree view.
There are numerous places in the UI that the 'delete' key removes the item from 
the list (threads in the debugger view for one).

We should be consistent everywhere!
fixed. Delete deletes selections.
