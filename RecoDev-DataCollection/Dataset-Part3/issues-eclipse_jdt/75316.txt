Martin, I've fixed this in SpellCheckConfigurationBlock which is a subclass of
"your" OptionsConfigurationBlock by sending out selection event which allows
dependent widgets to update:

	protected void updateCheckBox(Button curr) {
		super.updateCheckBox(curr);
		Event event= new Event();
		event.type= SWT.Selection;
		event.display= curr.getDisplay();
		event.widget= curr;
		curr.notifyListeners(SWT.Selection, event);
	}

You might want to consider enhancing your class.
back as discussed. OptionsConfigurationBlock has no dependency model.

Manually sending selection events is something we don't do yet and I would be
careful with that. 

adapting summary
Marking as fixed as the original bug is fixed and no further work planned.
