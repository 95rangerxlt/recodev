If an external jar "lib1.jar" references another external jar "lib2.jar" though the Class-Path: of its manifest, then the package explorer shows "lib1.jar" twice. This works fine if "lib1.jar" and "lib2.jar" are internal to the project.

Libraries to reproduce the problem

To reproduce:
1. Expand the attached zip in D:\temp
2. Create a new Java project
3. Add D:\temp\lib1.jar to its buildpath
Observe: lib1.jar appears twice. 

Instead, it should show lib2.jar and lib1.jar

I verified that the resolved classpath returned by JDT/Core is correct.
Fixed in HEAD.
Available in next N-build for 3.5 M4.
