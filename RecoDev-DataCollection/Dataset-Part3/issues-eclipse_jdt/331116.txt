Partially fixed in QuickAssistProcessor. Works on the variable declaration now. See bug 331138 for the remaining problem.

Keeping this bug open for 3.7. If bug 331138 is not fixed by then, we can release the workaround mentioned there.
This can be closed now, since bug 331138 is fixed.
Added regression tests to AssistQuickFixTest.
