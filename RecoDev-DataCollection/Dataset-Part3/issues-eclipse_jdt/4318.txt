Abstract    Export Jar wizard fails to include resources
Remarks:

Export Jar wizard fails to include resources

When you export a jar file, it doesn't include any of the
resources that are in the default folder.

I have some resources directly under my src directory.  Neither
the jar export wizard or the jar packager wizard exports these
resources.
