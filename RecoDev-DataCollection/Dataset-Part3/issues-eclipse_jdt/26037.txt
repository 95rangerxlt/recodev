The new Task markers feature in 2.1 is great! Now it would be even better if 
you could assign priorities to specific task markers. For example, for high 
priority tasks you use TODO_HIGH, for medium TODO_MEDIUM etc. 
So instead of one input field for the markers you would have three, one for 
each priority.
