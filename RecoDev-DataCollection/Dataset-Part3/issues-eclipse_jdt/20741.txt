Build 20020618
Win2k

In the dialog that comes up when you do a java search saying you have inexact 
matches, the check box for "Don't show this message again" is way to the left 
of the dialog, right against the border.

To see this, import all plugins and do a java search for "*Editor*" (need the 
asterisks), and select type, references, and workspace. It'll tell you how many 
it finds as it's searching.. you can just cancel when it gets to 100 and it'll 
tell you there are inexact matches.

Fixed: The checkbox is now aligned to the icon.
