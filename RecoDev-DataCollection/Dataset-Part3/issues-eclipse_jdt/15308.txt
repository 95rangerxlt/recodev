The initial size of the refactoring wizard is often too small and we are 
getting usability complaints. Suggest to persist the size and position of the 
refactoring wizard.

When restoring the position/size we should check that the wizard still fits on 
the current screen.

that's weird - i always find it too large rather than too small
The dialog size is automatically adjusted by JFace if it doesn't fit onto the 
screen.
