I got an internal notification error and a stack trace in my log while I was 
reading some java code.  I was not typing anything at the time.  I will attach 
the file I was editing, but I don't know exactly where the mouse was hovering at 
the time.  I was using the snippet editor, I had the class selected in the 
content outline, and I was reorganizing field declarations around the time it 
happened.  Here is a snippet of the log, I will attach the rest:

java.lang.ClassCastException: 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.BaseTypeBinding
	at 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.codeassist.select.SelectionOnMessageSend.resolveType(Se
lectionOnMessageSend.java:45)

After much playing around I have a reproducible case.  Hover over the "hello" 
method call in this example:

public class A {
	boolean foo;
	public int boo() {
		foo.hello();
	}
}
find method only if receiver type is a ReferenceBinding

Fixed
