Build 20020312

When editing the following source:

class X {
  void foo(){
      void baz(){ 
      }
  }
}

the outline will show #baz(), but after saving the working copy and expanding 
the unit in the package view, the method #baz() isn't part of the unit.

Regression due to change for reconciling with errors. It did trigger a full 
parse to get problems inside method bodies, but changed the syntax recovery 
semantic to perform a full parse, instead of diet parse + get method bodies.

Fixed.
