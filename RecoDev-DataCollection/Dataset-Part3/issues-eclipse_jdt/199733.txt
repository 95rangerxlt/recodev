Steps To Reproduce:
1. Select a class with a byte field, eg
public class Bug {
	byte	a;
}
2.Source | Generate hashCode() and equals() and generate it

The generated hashCode method doesn't reference the byte fields. The hashcode produced for the above method produces a result of:
  public int hashCode() {
	  final int prime = 31;
	  int result = 1;
	  return result;
  }

Which while strictly permissable results in hashtable's performance degrading to that of a list.
