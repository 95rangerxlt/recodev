In Java you can declare local variables just about anywhere in the code. That 
makes it difficult to, at a glance, see if a variable is local, a parameter or 
a instance or static field of the class. Naming conventions are often imposed 
to remedy this. However, different shops have a habit adopting different 
naming conventions, and you are increasingly likely to use toolkits in source 
form from a number of different origins. 

It would be helpful if it was possible to assign different colors to 
identifiers by their scope, so that e.g. fields and local variables would 
stand out as different in the editor.
