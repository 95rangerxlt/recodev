public class Zzzz {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int test= 1;
    System.out.println(test);
  }
}

Put the carret between the 'e' and the 's' in the second 'test', activate
'rename in file', hit Backspace, the 'e' is correctly removed but the carret
position is wrong. It is between the 's' and the second 't', it should be
between the first 't' and the 's'.

fixed > 20050503

problem introduced by fixing the same problem for ant-editors - now the default
partition type was not included in the set of tracked partition types any longer.

fixed in LinkedModeUI.getContentTypes
