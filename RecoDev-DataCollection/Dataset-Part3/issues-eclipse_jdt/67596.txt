Hello,
I would suggest an improvement for the outline view. Like in smalltalk, it could
be good to have method categories (protocols in smalltalk idiom). For realizing
this feature, we could base uppon either a comment in the code, or a meta-data
in jdk1.5. The outline view would be like :

+aCategory
   - amethod
   - aMethod2
+aCategory2
   - aMethod3
   - anAttribute1
....
the categories being able to be expanded or not
regards
Xavier

No further action planned for 3.0.
.
We now render categories (according to @category tag) in various views. In addition Outline, Members and Ctrl+O allow to filter using categories.

For more support see bug 132326.
