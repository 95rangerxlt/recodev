I extracted the following to a method.
The extacted method claimed it threw the exception that it is catching.
This caused an error in the calling method since the exception is no longer 
caught there.

SubViewSite site = new SubViewSite(getViewSite(), actionBarPropListener);
mapPageToSite.put(rec.page, site);
rec.subActionBars = (SubActionBars)site.getActionBars();
try {
	rec.page.init(site);
	// The following must be called after page initialization
	// so that the page has had a chance to register its selection
	// provider with the site.
	ISelectionProvider selectionProvider = site.getSelectionProvider();
	if (selectionProvider != null) {
		selectionProvider.addSelectionChangedListener(
selectionChangedListener);
	} 
} catch (PartInitException e) {
	WorkbenchPlugin.log(e.getMessage());
}

Generated Method

private void initPage(PageRec rec) throws PartInitException {
	SubViewSite site = new SubViewSite(getViewSite(), 
actionBarPropListener);
	mapPageToSite.put(rec.page, site);
	rec.subActionBars = (SubActionBars)site.getActionBars();
	try {
		rec.page.init(site);
		// The following must be called after page initialization
		// so that the page has had a chance to register its selection
		// provider with the site.
		ISelectionProvider selectionProvider = site.getSelectionProvider
();
		if (selectionProvider != null) {
			selectionProvider.addSelectionChangedListener
(selectionChangedListener);
		} 
	} catch (PartInitException e) {
		WorkbenchPlugin.log(e.getMessage());
	}
}

Can you please give me a hint, in which file this happened so that I can
try to reproduce it. Normally this case is handled correctly.
There was a bug when evaluating the catch blocks (time when I evaluated the 
catch block).
