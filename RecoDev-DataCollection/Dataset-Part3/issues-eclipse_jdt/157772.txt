As discussed some time ago, we could simplify the profile management

First page:
Label: Selected formatter/clean up profile:
Combo, Buttons 'Edit...', 'Remove'
Button 'New...', Button 'Import...'

Dialog:
Dialog Title: 'Formatter/Clean Up Profile 'xxx''
Label 'Profile name:', Text input field (Profile name), Button 'Export...'
Tabs

When editing a build in profile, profile name is grey and ok disabled, until the user changes a name.
If the user changes a setting, then we can automatically clear the name.
