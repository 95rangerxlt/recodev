	Current element delta behaviour works as follows: There are two delta queues in the 
	Java Model - one for java element deltas and one for resource deltas. When it comes
	time to fire deltas, if there are java element deltas, the resource deltas are ignored
	and the java element deltas are fire. 

	What should occurr: The resource deltas and java element deltas should be merged.
	If there is a java element delta for a resource, it takes precedence over the resource
	delta. However, java element deltas should be generated for resource deltas where
	there are no "better" java element deltas.

	This has surfaced in face of hot code replace. When a working copy is saved, the
	only delta generated is for the compilation unit, and no class file delta is generated.
	Ideally I would get both the CU delta, and deltas for the class file(s) that changed.

	Will have to be addressed past oct. 15.

Reworked the firing of IJavaElementDeltas by batching them.
Java model operations now only create deltas (they don't automatically fire 
them). If a java model operation modifies any resources, let the delta 
processor do the merging of the deltas and the firing. If the java model 
operation doesn't modify any resources (like the SetClasspathOperation), do the 
firing right away.
