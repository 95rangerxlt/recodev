In a read-only file if you highlight some text and press Ctrl+C to copy that 
text an error dialog pops up complaining that the file is read-only. Surely 
copying some text does not require a writable file!

Fixed. Build 20021210.
again in the same build as when I reported bug (200212041234) I noticed the 
Ctrl+F (find in file) also has the same effect of displaying a dialog box 
complaining about the file being read only. I don't know if your bug fix takes 
care of this shortcut as well...
