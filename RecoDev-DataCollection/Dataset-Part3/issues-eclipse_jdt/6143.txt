I used the 1.6 version of the plugin import tool.

To duplicate bug:
1. New workspace
2. Auto build off <- important
3. Import plugins
4. point to latest drop
5. Check import as source
6. Finish

All of the plugins are imported, but many have a warning saying
org.eclipse.xerces is missing.

If you open the java build path properties page and hit "ok" the problem goes
away.  Perhaps this is related to the project references bug 6142.
