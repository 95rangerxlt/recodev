The StandardDocletPageBuffer class imports org.w3c.dom.range.Range
and also defines a member type Range.

We should delete this import to both improve the clarity of the code
and to avoid this compiler error when working with xerces 1.4.x


NOTES:

EG (23.08.2001 15:42:45)
	the class is in 1.0 by accident. it isn't used. Deleted the class.
	released to 1.0 stream. fix will be in 133
