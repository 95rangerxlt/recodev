Build ID: I20080207-1530

Steps To Reproduce:
If you place the cursor over the name of a constructor and then hit Alt-Shift-R to rename and start typing, not all refs to the class name are linked in to the live rename, so if you hit Esc and don't opt for the full refactoring, you are left with broken refs to the class.

public class OuterClass {
  InnerClass ic;                   // 1
  public class InnerClass {        // 2 
    public InnerClass| {           // 3
    }
  }
}

Initiating rename from 3 causes only 2 and 3 to be linked. Initiating rename from 1 or 2 causes all three to be linked.

I don't always hit Enter to opt for the full refactoring if the change is local to the current class, because it takes a second to perform the refactoring, and the editor window closing and reopening is jarring :)

Fixed in HEAD of LinkedNodeFinder.

We now normalize all constructor bindings to the declaring type binding, which links all constructors together.
