The reason why we subclasses is that we didn't want to duplicate the 
selectAndReveal(IResource) code in all our wizards. It is important that we are 
using the same policy as the BasicNewResourceWizard for select and reveal. 
Therefore this behaviour should be available for reuse. 

Notice since the method doesn't need to access this it could be provided as a 
static API method. This would allow us to reuse it without subclassing.




It would be more general to add IWorkbenchPage.selectReveal(ISelection).
However, this could be abused.  It's probably better to do as Erich suggests 
and make it API just for use by new item wizards.
We can't make it a protected method on Wizard, since that's in JFace, so a 
static method on BasicNewResourceWizard, specific to IResource, would suffice.

moving to Platform UI please send the bug back to us so that we can adjust our 
code.
*** Bug 9093 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
BasicNewResourceWizard has selectAndReveal as a static method.
This has been in there since before the plugin split.

fixed (last remaining non-API use was in jdt.junit)
