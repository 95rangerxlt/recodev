This option GENERATES an Ant FILE. This should surface in the UI. Otherwise the
user could assume that the xml file is used to generate the doc.

agreed "Ant script" doesn' help. Also the fact that we store it in Ant format 
isn't the primary thing we should surface to the user.

We should tell something like "Save the settings of this Javadoc export:"
Right now if a user wants to generate javadoc from the ant script the option on 
the popup menu reads 'Run Ant...' so it is obvious to the user that the file is 
an Ant file. JRT.
Added a more explicite label explaining that the settings of the wizard are 
being stored as an antscript. JRT.
