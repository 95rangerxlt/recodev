I run the ContentAssistTestSuite and ran out of memory.

When inspecting with yourkit I saw that half of the memory (30 MB) is used in the UISynchronizer.messages; that's the queue of async-execs to be executed.

The fix would be to run the display loop between tests until empty. This would also make sure that the next test can start in a cleaner state.

Sorry now time to work on this for now, but patch is welcome. These tests run for years without ever seeing an OOME.

patch

I tracked down the runnables that were in the list and was also able to make some fixes in our land. There are now much fewer runnable around as before.

I still recommend to apply the patch.
