consider the following case:

public class Outer {
    private class Inner {
        public void foo() {
            Outer.this.f= 42;
        }
    }
}

Quick fix proposes to create a field, but it creates it in the inner class and
guesses the wrong type:

    private Object f;

creation of a local variable and parameter value should not be proposed at all.
