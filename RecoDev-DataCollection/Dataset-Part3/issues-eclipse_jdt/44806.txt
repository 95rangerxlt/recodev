When you have lines selected in a java editor, there are several quick assists 
like "surround with do", "surround with if" etc.

It would be nice if there also was a "surround with synchronized" quick assist.

Note that the 'surround with' quick assists are coming from the editor templates.
Simply create a new editor template that contains the variable ${line_selection}
and you will have the wanted quick assist!

But you're right, adding a template like that by default would make sense.
Moving to jdt.text to consider this.
Cool, thanks for the tip! :)

(BTW, introducing a try-finally template may also make sense.)
