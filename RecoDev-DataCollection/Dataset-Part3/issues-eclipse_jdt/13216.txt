Build 20020409

- create a new CU, declare the field private HashMap fMap; and save the file

The error icon in the vertical ruler hides the light bulp. So the user can't 
recognize anymore if the problem can be fixed using quick fix.

Possible solutions

- the error icon gets decorated with a light bulp if the error can be fixed 
  using quick fix.

- we use different colors for underlineing the problematic text range

Its getting even more surprising for the user if he now fixes the problem using 
quick fix. In this case the light bulp goes away but the build problem stays.

For the user it is somehow confusing that the system distinguishes between 
temporary problems and build problems. There should be only one concept.
The current behavior is that we don't take the error icon away but overlay 
compile time problems with temporary problems. This way the user sees quick-
fixable problems and no squigglies when a problem is fixed. We also perform 
problem checking on focus gain. Build F2.
