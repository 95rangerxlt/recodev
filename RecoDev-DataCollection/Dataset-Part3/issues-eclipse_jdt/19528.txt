Build F2

Related to Bug 19526 

In the Java JRE preferences page, I can associate multiple JARs with a JRE. 
But only the first JAR seems to be used for the JRE_LIB variable. This is 
problematic, since in my J9 JRE I have both OTI's classes.zip and Sun's rt.jar 
on the classpath. classes.zip needs to appear first, but there are classes in 
rt.jar which also need to be found.

You should use a container: see Advanced button in the Build path project 
properties.
That sounds like the right answer. 

So I suppose that my problem is really that there's no migration strategy to 
use containers.

All my existing projects use JRE_LIB, and are shared in the repository. I'm 
loathe to change them all just so that I can use J9 as my default JRE. 
Additionally, new projects are created with a JRE_LIB, not a JRE container.

Is there any way that JRE_LIB can be configured to point to a JRE container?
No, but migration might be done through some UI in the future.
Erich ?
correct, but in the future, i.e., not for 2.0
fixed by class path containers
