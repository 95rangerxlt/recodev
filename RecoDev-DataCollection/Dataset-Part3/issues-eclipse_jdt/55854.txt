I2004030240010 + plug-in export for I200403240800

Cannot reproduce. Anything in .log
probably related to 51851
I encountered a problem which may be related (which is why I am adding a 
comment here instead of opening a new bug report - if it isn't related, then a 
new bug might need to be opened): I'm using 3.0M8, and in the Outline view I 
had a long list of fields and methods (long meaning maybe 40 or 50, enough 
that they didn't all fit in the visible area). When I clicked on the icon to 
hide fields, it left the fields displayed and instead hid what appeared to be 
an equal number of methods lower down in the list. This seems to have been an 
anomaly, since I haven't been able to reproduce it after restarting Eclipse.
This has been fixed for M9 in Platform UI: there was a bug related to tree
viewer filtering.
