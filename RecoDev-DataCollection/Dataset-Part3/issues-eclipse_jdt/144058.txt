Eclipse 3.2
Currently, when a user creates a new Java project, the default project layout is set to use the project's folder as the root for source and output class files. This creates a very cluttered directory structure for the user, should there ever be a need to examine the project's folder in the "Navigator" view or in some file manager. Most developers creates a separate build folder when compiling with Ant, so having this similar "feature" activated from the get-go as the default will teach new (Java) programmers how to properly organize their files in the event that they are not using an IDE.

Moving to JDT/UI.
+1 for all that is holy
The default behaviour is configurable on Java > Build Path.
But we could also change the default default. I agree.
Agreed.  I have to work with people who have do not know about, and have not set it to, the src/bin setting.  Egads!

Shortest patch ever ;)

If this gets implemented, you may want to actually swap the locations of the 'SelectionButtonDialogField' items ;)
See also the same bug I entered about a year ago: bug 99543  :-)
And I would not want that one to be WONTFIXED this time ...

I am even spending a vote for it ;-)
28 votes so far and rising says something doesn't it?

Well. All it says is that some people followed the advice of some bloggers. Maybe that should be called bugzilla-spamming.....

I think it's more related to that people didn't see this the first time it came around ;)
Indeed, I can't understand that default - you can't even put jar files into the project with default layout.
> you can't even put jar files into the project with default layout.
Why not? This works for me.

It's a small case of dumb defaults, everybody changes it when creating the first new project in a workspace and moves on, so it doesn't lead to a lot of bug reports ...

I think the blog entries have just reminded people of that bad default, and they have given an easy way to express it - a vote for this bug. At least for me it was so.

Back to the bug: I don't think anybody argues that not creating distinct source and output folders is better. 

I'll also confirm my vote with stating that I really want this change. I was just too lazy, and I have been confronted with the problem too seldom, to create my own bug report.

This is the first thing I change in the new Eclipse installation. +1

Call it what you like.  It's been drawn to people's attention.  The people have seen and the people have voted.  All that remains is to implement the patch.
Not to mention that PDE new plugin project wizard *** requires *** that you use the /src and /bin project layout.
Benno, can you release this for 3.3 when we're ready with the 3.3 stream?
Note that we're in the last week of 3.2 where we fix only stop-ship problems.
ok
btw, thanks JDT guys/gals ;)
