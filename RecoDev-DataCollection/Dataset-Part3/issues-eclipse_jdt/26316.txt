1. configure 'use tabs' and 'tab size= 4'
2. create method (note that 2 spaces and 4 spaces are used for the indent)
  void foo() {
    //hello
  }
3. copy another (random) string to clipboard
4. insert new line after '//hello' and paste
5. note that the new inserted string has an indent space/space/tab
   it should better copy the indent string from the line before -> 4 x space

Why is using the formatting options not good enough?
the formatting options are fine. It's the indent created by the 'smart indent 
feature'; its a mix of spaces and tabs.
For code generation we use the strategy to copy as much as possible the indent 
string of the previous statement.
closing - currently smart paste indents the pasted code such that it is aligned
with your block as specified by the indent preferences.
