When using fonts other than the default font the layout of characters does not match the 
positions used by the editor.  The end of the line is often past the last displayed 
character.  Clicking in the text does not result in changes being applied to the character 
where the click occured.  This seems more pronounced with variable size fonts.  The 
problem seemed to occur most often with the first comment line of a java doc comment.

Can you give a concrete example (used font, which editor, which Eclipse build).
We have known problems regarding italic fonts.

I just tried to recreate this, since I do not remember the exact circumstances.  I was not able to 
recreate this with a short attempt.  As I remember it, I was working in 1.2 on OS/X and using 
larger font sizes (12 or more) with the most likely font being Garamond (which I have in a 
FontSuitcase file version 2.5 microsoft typography format).
OK to close?
Andr√© can you confirm that this works on the Maxc using latest I-build?
Verified for M3: problem no longer occurs.
(I've fixed this problem some months ago...)
