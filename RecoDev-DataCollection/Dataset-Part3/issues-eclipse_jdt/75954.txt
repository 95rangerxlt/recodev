If you create a launcher that launches a test method (via a right click on the
method and select debug). Then you go in and want to change which project it
runs against it blows away the method. 

I have already checkout the HEAD from cvs, debugged, pin-pointed, fixed and
tested the JUnitMainTab.java code and have a fix that fixes this bug and takes
into account the workaround for bug 65399. I will submit this patch file to the
developer mailing list after submitting this bug report.

Thanks.

This is the text I sent to the jdt-core-dev-request@eclipse.org - hope that is
the right place to put it!

Thanks
Please fix this one ASAP! I have tests for which I need to specify VM 
arguments, and the second I set them in the launch configuration, the test 
method gets lost. The launch config is now basically useless, since it now 
insists on running all the tests in the suite!
Erich, can you please have a look.
patch looks good, thanks - integrated and released
