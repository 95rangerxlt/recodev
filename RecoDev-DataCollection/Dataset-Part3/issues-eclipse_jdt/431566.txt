The documentation from bug 364820 & bug 380074 must be updated to reflect that in 1.8 these are now type annotations.
Also needed:
- migration hints
- documentation of the attribute of @NonNullByDefault

Some of this can be handled by referring to the annotations' javadoc.

Shankha, the current help (/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_null_annotations.htm) shows two screenshots of quickfixes for adding null annotations to the project (heading "Setup of the build path").

Please closely watch if there will be any activity on bug 413583.
Whatever outcome you see on that bug, please prepare a new screenshot
for the plug-in case, which should suggest to add an optional dependency
using Require-Bundle.
Created attachment 243878
First take

Here's a first take at the new documentation (with minor updates also in the existing section).

Anyone have the time for a quick proof-read & comments?
Naturally, the documentation is best viewed by firing up a runtime workbench, accessing the help documents from a workspace project :)
I will go through the documentation.

Thanks

Had a quick glance and things look fine overall. There is a lot of details, which will require another round, which I can devote time for perhaps tomorrow. 

Just one question at this point - In null type annotations section (unlike the older null annotations section), the annotations appear as a hyperlinks but don't take my anywhere. Should I be expecting them to work at this point? I see we don't yet have the corresponding APIs added in the doc.isv project.

I think this pb is particular to running a workbench where doc.isv is used from sources. If you use the host's version instead you should see the javadoc.
The full SDK build seems to correctly generate these.

I see, thanks for clarifying.
I've pushed my changes / additions via http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=809d40eac5e0fa8ca69b979ad8330296abca5379

Feel free to edit as needed.
Further update regarding the no-longer-recommended quick fix (see bug 413583) released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=a24df834b818100666397f4e801a61cf8878161d.
In org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_null_type_annotations.htm, I see many hyperlink references to org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/annotation/... for which the files do not exist.

Is that folder yet to be added?

Please refer to comment #7. I could verify the links working from the official latest I build.
Stephan, thanks for the detailed explanation in the documents. 
It really cleared all the doubts.
