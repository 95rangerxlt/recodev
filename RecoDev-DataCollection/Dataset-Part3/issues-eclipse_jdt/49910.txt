I'm currently working with a
SET_OF_200_QUITE_LONG_CONSTANTS_IN_ANOTHER_COMPILATION_UNIT (yes, the code
formatter options). They often have similar prefixes, so the last few characters
are significant for me to select the proper one. However, the default size of
the content assist window is too small to display them. 

It would therefore be nice if this window could remember its size once I made it
big enough.
