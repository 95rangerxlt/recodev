This program runs fine as is.  But if the add(x,y) method is inlined, then the resulting logic compiles but throws an NPE at runtime.

public class Bug {
    static String[]field;
    public static void main(String[]args){
        add((field=args).length,field.hashCode());
    }
    static int add(int x, int y){
        return y+x;
    }
}

Fixed for RC1.

Test case added. Fix is to evaluate the arguments and store them into temporary locals to ensure that the evaluation of the args is happening in the correct order. This only happens if var assigments like in the example happen.
Setting to fixed.
