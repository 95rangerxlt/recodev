Build 2.0

When I save a java editor after performing any edit that modifies a method 
signature, the cursor jumps to the top of the class and the class name is 
automatically selected.  I frequently hit save when coding and then continue to 
type immediately.  Since the cursor position has jumped to the top of the class 
definition, this causes the class name to be deleted and my new text to appear 
in the wrong place. This appears to be related to my double-click settings and 
my java appearance preferences, so I will attach a preference export file to the 
bug report.
