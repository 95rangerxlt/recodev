I agree if the is no other top level type. Otherwise deleting one type in the 
browsings types view might delete two types.

My expectation is:

- CU with one type: deletion of type deletes CU
- CU with more than one type: I get a dialog asking what to do.


when there're 2 or more types then it should always just _not delete_ the cu

will change the behavior to:
- if deletion will produce a cu with no types - delete the cu as well (without 
asking)
- otherwise, don't delete the cu
fixed
