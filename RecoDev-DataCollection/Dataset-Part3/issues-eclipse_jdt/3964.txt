If two projects are extracted, there can be duplicate files (most
	common case: .classpath).
	It would be nice to see which file is duplicate and hence which one
	was included.

	Same applies for other (error) messages: we should see which file in
	which project was the cause.

	See also: 1GEXVEU: ITPJUI:ALL - JAR Packager: Duplicate entry message should contain full file name

	1. Verified that full path is used wherever we have the control
	2. Catched IOException during write to JAR and use full path
		Unfortunately the file name is repeated because we can not
		influence the IOException message and we do not know what
		IOException occurred.

	Fixed in 2.0 stream
