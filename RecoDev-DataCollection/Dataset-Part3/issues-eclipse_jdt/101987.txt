Convert anonymous to nested does not add comments to the new field if specified
in the preferences.  I would expect comments on:

- The new type
- Any generated constructor
- Any generated field

Sorry, when I said "the new field", I meant "the new type"
One last note: this has likely been around forever, and should not in any way

Tobias, we have to discuss what to do with templates and comments in 3.2. Best
is to talk to Martin at some point...
