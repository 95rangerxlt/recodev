Have org.eclipse.jface imported as binary plug-in. Open java editor for binary class TreeSelection. In source, the nested class InitializeData is just before the constructors, but in the Outline, it appears at the very end.

I guess the problem is that SourcePositionSorter#compare(..) returns 0 if parents are not identical.
- Bug: should not test IJavaElement equality with !=
- Problem: IType InitializeData is a child of IType TreeSelection, but TreeSelection is not the parent of InitializeData (TreeSelection is only the declaring type of InitializeData).
