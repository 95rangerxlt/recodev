When viewing source of an archive, you can tie source to it. But you have to 
take the extra step of zipping it up, which is tough if you are working on 
that source itself. 

Would be handy to be able to point to just the root dir for source. I hit this 
while debugging jboss code, keep having to zip it all up (comes in tarball).

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 23126 ***
Reopening so as to consider changing UI to allow attaching source dir to jar 
and/or class folders (bug 23126 being fixed)
Not for 2.1
Reopening...
Got addressed for 2.1 (Source Attachement->Folder).
