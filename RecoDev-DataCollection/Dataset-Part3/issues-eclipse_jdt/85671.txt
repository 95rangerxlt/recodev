tobias, you did the conversion to bindings-based operations.
sorry, wrong pR
Problem is in OverrideMethodProposal. It uses
Bindings.findMethodInHierarchy(ITypeBinding, String, String[]) to find the
supertype's method but doesn't find it in this case.
Tobias, this is along the same lines.
Added special treatment of java.lang.Object to Bindings.findMethodInHierarchy 
for interfaces
