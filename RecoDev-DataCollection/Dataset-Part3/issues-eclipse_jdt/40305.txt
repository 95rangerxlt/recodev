1. Create a class with multiple fields
2. Choose create constructor using fields from the context menu
- note that the action is not available through the Source menu, only through
the context menu
- note that the context menu entry uses the same mnemonic "C" as "Add
constructors from superclass"

3. select on field (not the last one)
4. Try to move it down using keyboard only:
- "Down" button uses same mnemonic as "Deselect All"

- Choosing a shortcut for one of the buttons transfers focus to the button,
which is a pain when trying to rearrange the fields quickly. Use case:

Have four fields; choose all; move first two down; move last three up;
-> in order to accomplish that, one has to tab back to the tree view to select a
new field field
-> Better: don't give focus when using keyboard shortcuts (might be platform,
though)

The action must be part of the global context menu.
