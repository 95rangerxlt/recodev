Is it possible to automatically generate the "generic angle bracket syntax" for
the concrete class creation based on the type declared on the left hand side of
the equal sign? For example when a user types this:

List<String> pathList = new ArrayList

and presses <  

code completion should give 

List<String> pathList = new ArrayList<String>(|);

with the cursor sitting inside the parenthesis ( as it does now for other things)

This will be very useful.

Cheers

Simply use code completion before typing the '<'.
We should be smarter and also make it work when code assist is invoked after '<'.
