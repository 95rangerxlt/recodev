Build 20020321

- I used the Open Type dialog to open an editor on a type.
- It turned out that only .class files were available, so I got an empty 
editor on a .class file.
- So I navigated to the JAR which contained the class, opened its Properties 
dialog, and attached source to the JAR file
- When I pressed OK, the .class editor disappeared.

This behaviour is suboptimal!  Instead, the .class editor should update itself 
with the source code that it can now see.
