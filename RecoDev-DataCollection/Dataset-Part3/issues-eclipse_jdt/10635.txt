I have a class which implements a nested interface of another class.
public class A {
  public static interface C {
    void foo();
  }
}

public class B implements A.C {
}

I see in my task list errors saying that I need to provide an implementation.
However, when I click on Override methods in the Outline view, this method is
not listed.

Note: This is a simplification of my problem, I am not sure if this will 
actually cause the problem.

Problem in JDT core:
Super hierarchy of be does not contain any superinterfaces.
(To observer set a breakpoint in StubUtil.evalUnimplementedMethods:
  IType[] superInterfaces= hierarchy.getAllSuperInterfaces(type);
)
When finding the handle corresponding to an interface binding, we used the last 
segment of the compound name (which is 'A$C') instead of the source name.
Fixed.
