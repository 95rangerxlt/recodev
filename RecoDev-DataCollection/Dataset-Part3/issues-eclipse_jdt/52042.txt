When I change the java compiler options, for example I change some warning 
from 'ignore' to 'warning', and press Apply, it says 'The compiler settings 
have changed. A full rebuild is required to make changes effective. Do the 
full build now?'. If I say Yes, then it does a full rebuild in the foreground 
using a modal progress dialog so I can't do anything else with Eclipse until 
it's done. This should do a background build instead. I'm not sure it should 
even prompt.

Allow to do that in the background makes sense. Will have to see if that doesn't
lead into blocking of the finish of other pref pages. 
I think it has be prompted, as such a build usually really takes minutes so I'm
mostly clikcing 'no' here and do a build after other modifications.
If you make two changes, the first change would kick off a build, and the 
second change should cancel the first build and kick off a new one.

don't you think user control is always the best? 
Prompting would be ok with me, but if I say 'yes' and there is already a build 
in progress I don't want to wait for the first one to finish. I know there's a 
generic job-blocks-job dialog but in this case it's clear what the user wants.
implemented a new progress monitor with a 'go to background' button.
This is experimental, we might change that again
