Attached is a very simple jar. It contains 2 text files where one is at the 
root of the jar and the other is contained in a subdirectory. Create a project 
and add the jar to the Java Build Path as an External Jar. In the Packages 
View, expand the jar to see the files. Double-clicking on the root file 
(readme.txt) successfully opens a text editor. However, double-clicking on the 
file in the subdirectory (copyright.txt) results in the error:
   Cannot open Java editor on copyright.txt. Invalid path: null.

The problem seems to be in the class JarEntryFile. The path field is 
constructed from just the simple entryName, so it does not contain the actual 
path information. Thus the method getContents() fails because it is unable to 
properly locate the zip entry.

This is important to us as we need to be able to read the manifest.mf file in 
the META-INF directory of externals jars. This used to work in Eclipse 1.0.

Created attachment 734
simpe zip containing two .txt files
moving to JDT CORE for investigation
Now I am adding the package name (replacing '.' with '/') in front of the entry name. This fixed the 
problem.
Fixed. I need to way before I can release it that the patch for M5 is out.
Released in HEAD.
