As of I20030722 (and including I20030723), <ctrl-shift-m> adds a new line to the
text instead of adding an import.  It works fine for the preceeding integration
build I20030718 (3.0M2).

could reproduce on I20030723
the key binding does not go to 'Add import' anymore
probably releated to bug 40607
does 'add import' from the menu still work?
It did in I20030722.  I didn't try in I20030723.
There was a problem with key board short cuts I20030723 scoped to editors. 
This got fixed for the latest integration build.
