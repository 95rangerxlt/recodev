Would like to see the following improvements in override method dialog

- check box, if comment should be generated. Global preference is somehow
  to restrictive.
- should use a template for the Java doc
- should allow me to specify the insertion point. I always have to move the
  methods afterwards

all 3 suggestions make sense, but are lower priority for 2.0.

proposed enhancements.

Adds a viewerpane with a toolbar button for changing the treeviewer display.
Looked nicer than just adding the toolbar. Adds a combo box with available
methods in a class for possible insertion positions. Adds the option to insert
at cursor position where relevant. Adds a checkbox for choosing whether to
create comments. The checkbox is populated based on whether prefs->java->code
generation->code and comments->"Automatically add comments for new methods and
types" is checked. The checkbox overrides the default comment creation choice.
implemented in 3.0 M1
