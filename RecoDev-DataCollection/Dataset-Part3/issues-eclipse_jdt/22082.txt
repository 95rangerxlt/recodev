Build 2.0

In the following example put the cursor before m and expand to enclosing 
element. Observe: the whole method is selected. Now change method name m to mm 
and do the same again. Observe: simple name mm is selected. There should not be 
a difference in this case.

package p;
class A{
	void m(int t){
	}
}

test added and bug fixed
This fix (don't select adjacent node) was not deemed appropriate (see bug 80345).
Corrected tests and implementation to always select the adjacent node on
zero-length selection at a boundary.
