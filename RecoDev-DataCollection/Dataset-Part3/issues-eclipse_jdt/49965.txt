In the menu of the toolbar button "Go To Next Annotation", I have "Diff Changes"
checked.

In a JavaEditor with QuickDiff changes, additions and deletions, the "Go To Next
..." actions only jump to changes and deletions, but not to additions.

Tom, are offset and length of the addition annotations correct?
they are - diff annotations used to be all of one type (just changes) but are
now two (changes and additions), with the latter configured not to show up in
the next/previous dropdown. 

we can change that, resulting in separate choices for additions and changes...
not the best solution, but is there another?
