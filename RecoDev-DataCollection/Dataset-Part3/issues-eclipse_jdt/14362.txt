Build 20020412

1. Create a java project JP1
2. Create a package jp1
3. Create Class A and B under jp1
4. Insert this "private A a;" under class B and class B should looks like

package jp1;

public class B {
	private A a;
}

5. Close B.java and mark it as read only.
6. Reopen B.java and you should not be able to insert any characters
7. Position the cursor to "private |A" (i.e. immediate before A)
   and hit CTRL-SPACE

8. It will insert B into it and it becomes

package jp1;

public class B {
	private BA a;
}
    and now the editor is dirty and you're unable to save
