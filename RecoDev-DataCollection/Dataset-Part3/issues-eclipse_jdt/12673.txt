if i use special characters like ä, ö, ü i have to escape them in java-doc like 
this: &auml;, &ouml; and &uuml;

When the mouse is hovering above a class/method and displays the java-doc-
comment this escape-sequence is not resolved.

we don't have a full blown HTML renderer - not for 2.0 unless we get external 
help.
Reopening for 2.1 consideration

Hi,

this bug seems to be still active.
When using the tooltip, on must html-specialchars the ";" is cut off and no
parsing is made. This happens an nearly every html-char I tried, so not only the
german ones.
But using the view "JavaDoc" all signs are parsed. 
Also when using F2 to enter the focus of the tooltip, the parsing is made.

Wouldn't it be easy to use the same method as it is used in focus-mode?

Greetings

Torsten

p.s. Isn't the correct servity fot this "trivial" instead of enchancement? it's
a bug, because there IS some parsing, otherwise the ";" wouldn't have been cut off.
This will go away once we use the Browser widget for hovering.

What are the timescales for that change?


Not on the 3.2 plan.
Fixed in HEAD.
