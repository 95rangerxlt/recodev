When opening a Java editor, problems are requested once during
ICompilationUnit#becomeWorkingCopy and once during ICompilationUnit#reconcile.

The IProblemRequestor should be disabled during #becomeWorkingCopy so as to
avoid to compute problems (which involves the full resolution of the working copy).

Note: clients calling reconcile(...) and expecting an AST will now be broken
i.e. they will not get an AST. See bug 76738.
