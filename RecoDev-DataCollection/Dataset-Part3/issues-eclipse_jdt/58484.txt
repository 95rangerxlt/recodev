Using M8 Stream Build I20040413 I'm getting extra ")" when entering function 
calls.
1. begin typing function call ... x = foo(
2. eclipse completes the call with closing )
3. enter parameters for the call ... x = foo( 1, 2
4. here is where things change from M7.  In M7, I would enter the ")" to close 
the function call, and eclipse would leave only one close paren.
With M8, when I enter a close paren, I end up with two in the file.
ex.  x = foo( 1, 2 ))

For me, it is more natural to close the function parameters by entering the 
close paren which M7 seemed to allow.  I would prefer to have the Java editor 
work as it did before.

this is fixed in I20040420 and later
