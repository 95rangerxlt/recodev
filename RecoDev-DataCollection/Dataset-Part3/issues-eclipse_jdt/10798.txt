In the example 

package validSelection;

public class A_test201 {
	public void foo() {/*[*/

The source position of the MethodDeclaration's block is [70/21]. It should be 
[69/23].

In the example

	public void foo() {/*[*/
		foo();
	/*]*/} 
}

The source position of the MethodDeclaration's block is [70/21]. It should be 
[69/23].
So if I well understood, you expect the method declaration block positions to 
be:
startPosition = position of the beginning of the '{'.
endPosition = position of the end of 
the '}'.

Fixed and released in HEAD.
