com.sun.mirror.apt.Filer.createSourceFile() is documented as throwing an IOException if it can't create the file.  In fact, we don't create the file until it is closed; but close() does not throw.  So we need to validate the supplied name up front, in order for processors to be able to report errors to the user.

The same applies to the Java 6 version, javax.annotation.processing.Filer, although there it is a FilerException that is to be thrown.

Actually, the createSourceFile() part of this is already done, as of 11/13/06.  It should still be done for createClassFile(), createTextFile(), and createBinaryFile().
Text test case in FileGenerationTests.  Source file test case in AptBuilderTests.
