In 205, the compiler doesn't generate .class files with AccSuper set. This flag 
should always be set according to the VM specs for code compatible with JDK 1.1 
and above. The flag has been mistakenly removed with the code that clear 
AccSynchronized for a class. AccSynchronized and AccSuper have the same value 
(0x20).
