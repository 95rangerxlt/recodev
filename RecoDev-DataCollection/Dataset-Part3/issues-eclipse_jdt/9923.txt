as pointed out on the newsgroup - 
open type hierachy pref wording could be improved.

i suggest:
Open a new type hierarchy as:
. a new view (Type Hierarchy View)
. a new perspective (Type Hierarchy Perspective)

the stuff in the brackets could be left out, maybe

we should improve the wording and the suggestion is an improvement.

The view is called "Hierarchy" view and the Perspective is called "Java Type 
Hierarchy".

I suggest the following wording:
When opening a Type Hierarchy:
* Show the Type Hierarchy View in the current perspective
* Open a new Type Hierarchy Perspective
