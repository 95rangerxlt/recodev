Organize Imports no longer fixes those imports that it when there's a conflict.
Given:
package test;
public class E01 {
	ArrayList foo;
	List foo2;
}
package test;
public class E02 {
	ArrayList foo;
}

1. Select test package
2. Organize imports
Is:
 ArrayList is not imported in E01
Should:
 be imported, no ambiguity

Hint: This is not a regression, it is also in 3.2.2, this is not due to the fact that we use the clean up infrastructure now.
