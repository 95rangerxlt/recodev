Hi.
Eclipse contains some proprietary files which are troublesome for distribution.
First of all, in the source code:
./plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/src/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessors.java:
/**
 * @(#)AnnotationProcessors.java  1.2 04/06/21
 *
 * Copyright 2004 Sun Microsystems, Inc. All rights reserved.
 * SUN PROPRIETARY/CONFIDENTIAL. Use is subject to license terms.
 */

And secondly the file:
plugins/javax.servlet_2.4.0.v200705291052.jar
contains 
./javax/servlet/resources/web-app_2_3.dtd
./javax/servlet/resources/web-app_2_4.xsd
./javax/servlet/jsp/resources/web-jsptaglibrary_2_0.xsd

that are all under a proprietary sun license.

For the APT plugin, take a look at the about.html in the org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core plugin - it explains the licensing and redistribution terms.

Ok, thanks very much ... this means that those files' licenses are overruled by the about.html file!? Sorry -- we oversaw that.
I can see now that the same is the case for the servlet plugin -- urgs.
Sorry for the bells ... closing bug as invalid.
Went to submit my comments, but got conflicts. Am adding here just for completeness.

What version of Eclipse are you using?

javax.servlet and javax.servlet.jsp are distributed through the Apache license
and that's how these files were obtained. I don't believe there is any mention
of proprietary or confidential in these files.

For reference, here are the CQs that were approved by the Eclipse Foundation
for use of these packages in Eclipse:
CQ for javax.servlet: https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1343
CQ for javax.servlet.jsp: https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1344

In the upcoming Eclipse 3.3 release, the version of AnnotationProcessors.java
is v1.7 and it also doesn't have mention of confidential in its copyright.
There is mention of the Sun license in the about.html for the APT Core bundle.

From org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core about.html:

   Third Party Content

   The Content includes items that have been sourced from third parties 
   as set out below. If you did not receive this Content directly from 
   the Eclipse Foundation, the following is provided for informational 
   purposes only, and you should look to the Redistributorâ€™s license 
   for terms and conditions of use.

This leads me to believe that linux distros can't redistribute anything from the com.sun.mirror package without getting permission from Sun. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know if I'm interpreting this correctly but is this the intension? Does every company who makes product with eclipse have to get permission from Sun to redistribute the com.sun.mirror package?

That may be the case for 3.3 but the problem still exists in 3.2.2 - the copyright in this version of org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/src/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessors.java is:

   /**
    * @(#)AnnotationProcessors.java        1.2 04/06/21
    *
    * Copyright 2004 Sun Microsystems, Inc. All rights reserved.
    * SUN PROPRIETARY/CONFIDENTIAL. Use is subject to license terms.
    */

So it seems to be subject to the Java Mirror API license terms in about.html only if you got Eclipse from eclipse.org.
Ben, you should pose any legal questions you have to the Eclipse Foundation:
license (at) eclipse.org
> I'm not a lawyer so I don't know if I'm interpreting this correctly but is this

We're not lawyers either :)  You'll have to ask your own legal counsel, or perhaps the foundation legal people will offer you advice. Sorry.
uffff ... this licensing stuff is so confusing to me.
Regarding ./plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/src/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessors.java:
in eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-3.3RC4.tar.zip the version with the troublesome license was still included, so I reopen the bug and leave it open until this one is fixed.
The same is the case for the other files: They were included in the 3.3 archive.

I will write a mail to legal@eclipse.org and point them to this bug.
Moving to the ipzilla component at the foundation in hope it gets attention from Janet there.

Have you send the mail yet? Can you CC me? Alternately I can write it and CC you. Let me know. We should definitely work together on this one because we have the same problem. Cheers, Ben
Thank you for highlighting the potential issue for us.  We are looking into it.

I just pointed them to the bug so everything is discussed here, don't worry. I think it should all be discussed here, so everybody will have the possibility to follow the progress.
It wasn't my intend to discuss something off-bugzilla ... it was just to speed up the visibility of the bug.

The answer:
Daniel,

Yes, we will definitely look into this.

Thanks.

The first license file that you reference originates from a Sun distribution that is available from Sun (https://aptmirrorapi.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList)under a BSD style license.  We are in touch with Craig Russell at Sun to clarify the existence of the notice highlighted below in light of Sun's release of the code under the BSD style license:  
* @(#)AnnotationProcessors.java  1.2 04/06/21
 *
 * Copyright 2004 Sun Microsystems, Inc. All rights reserved.
 * SUN PROPRIETARY/CONFIDENTIAL. Use is subject to license terms.

Thank you for highlighting this to us.

The other files you reference are part of an Apache Tomcat distribution and we clarified with Apache the licensing of these materials during our initial due diligence activity on this package.  I hope this helps.
We have received clarification from one of the Sun project leads that the confidential notice referred to above was included in error and will be fixed.
Resolved.
Hi.
Eclipse 3.3 source archive
http://europa-mirror1.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.3-200706251500/download.php?dropFile=eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-3.3.zip
still contains the problematic sun file. Can we just replace it with the GPL version of the file? Or will this download get replaced by another version that does not contain this file? ... our legal department will not let me push this out with this file included :(
Thanks for any help,
Regards,
Daniel

Indeed.  This is no longer an issue for the Foundation's legal team, so I'm not sure who inherits this.  Releng?

grep "SUN PROPRIETARY" * -R
plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/src/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessors.java: * SUN PROPRIETARY/CONFIDENTIAL. Use is subject to license terms.

Janet can likely answer the first question.  Kim can likely comment on the second part.
The file should not be replaced with a GPL licensed version of the file.  Rather the file should be replaced with the updated version that Sun has provided on their update site (referenced in comment #13) which is licensed under the BSD style license.  

Janet
I will move to the component who owns this code. They will need to obtain and release the latest update from Sun.
The latest version of the mirror API from https://aptmirrorapi.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList has the correct licensing in the source files. It appears that all we need to do is swap out our com.sun.mirror source code with the latest from there.
I presume we should do this for 3.3.1, and also for 3.4.  Should we also replace the version that is in the 3.2 maintenance branch in CVS, even though there will be no further releases built from that branch?
Released to HEAD and 3.3.1.
