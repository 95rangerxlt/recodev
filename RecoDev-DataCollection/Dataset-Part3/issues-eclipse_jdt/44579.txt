We just realized that JDT has its own ISV doc tree that our Ant-based 
extension point doc generator does not cover. Platform ISV doc has the 
following:

- book.css for all documentation
- schema.css for extension point docs (generated from ex. point schemas)

Note that schema.css extends book.css and adds a few more tags. 

We just realized that you have your own book.css that is different than 
platform's. I guess you don't really care :-) about the content of the file 
and haven't even noticed that platform's book.css evolved. It doesn't seem
logical to me that these two files are not identical (so that overall SDK
documentation is consistent). Anyway, I replaced your book.css with
platform's book.css and haven't noticed any glaring problems in JDT ISV doc.

Here is our request:

1) Replace JDT ISV book.css with the one from platform ISV doc plug-in
2) Add schema.css from platform ISV doc plug-in

Both steps are required so that JDT ISV extension point docs can look correct. 
Right now, their formatting is horrible due to the missing style sheets.

Is it possible to have this done in time for M4?

We are almost done with producing our build input (sanity checked, test cases 
run, ...). Why is this critical for M4. As you pointed out we live with this 
since a long time.
We did have this for a long time, but it is only now that it is causing 
problems because of cascading style sheets in extension point docs. When we 
declare M4, releng will replace Eclipse used for the actual builds, and it is 
important to have the CSS files in place when all the docs are regenerated. We 
would like to have correct-looking JDT docs in M4.
I just realized that the previous append is not clear enough.

When all the Eclipse team declare a GO for M4, Releng team will move to M4 for 
building and rebuild M4 once again to get regenerate the extension point docs 
(this is important because we made some changes in the Ant task that does the 
generation). For this to work, CSS files must be in place. 
What are the side effects of this change ?
And why is only JDT ISV affected
Adding schema.css to JDT ISV has no side-effects (you didn't have it before). 
As I said, I replaced your book.css with book.css platform and didn't see any 
differences in JDT ISV docs. If anything, it will bring your document's 
presentation (fonts, formatting etc.) in line with those of the platform.

We did all our tests with cascading on extension points from the platform, but 
didn't realize that JDT has its own book.css. During the build, Releng uses 
PDE-provided Ant task that parses the extension point schema files and places 
them in the reference/extension-points directory. The generated files have two 
references for style sheets (../../book.css and ../../schema.css) that should 
be in the ISV plug-in. Without the files, generated docs look funny (because 
expected formatting styles are missing). 

Platform book.css is more complex and has more style and color definitions 
that our schema.css extend. Since your book.css don't have these style tags, 
we look funny.
I put in the requested changes for M4.
This may be uneccessary, but have you modified your build.xml to pick up the 
new file? Our student Cherie noticed that you have a custom build script and 
that you would need to add schema.css so that it is picked up.

From here note:

I was looking through JDT doc.isv's build.xml and they have the line:

<fileset dir="${basedir}" 
includes="*.properties,*.xml,*.zip,*.html,*.htm,*.gif,book.css" 
excludes="build.properties,build.xml,buildDoc.xml"/>

which I propose be changed to:

<fileset dir="${basedir}" 
includes="*.properties,*.xml,*.zip,*.html,*.htm,*.gif,*.css" 
excludes="build.properties,build.xml,buildDoc.xml"/>

to pick up the new schema.css file.
Daniel, can you please make the changes requested by Dejan for the next 
integration build. 
Dejan, I changed the build.xml as suggested. What about the book.css in
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.users, do we have to replace this one as well?

You can if you want, but it is not vital to schema documents because these 
documents can be found only in the ISV plug-in. You may want to do it for the 
sake of overall style consistency, though.
Yes, makes sense. Done.
