We will finish the 'Fix Deprecation' refactoring that didn't make it into 3.2, and add the new refactoring 'Replace Invocation'. More refactoring API will be offered in the plug-in org.eclipse.jdt.core.manipulation so the refactoring infrastructure can be used with a UI. [JDT UI]

Refactoring API for move and rename got added for 3.3 M6.

'Fix Deprecation' and 'Replace Invocation' will have to wait, we're short on manpower. But if everything goes well, we'll have 'Introduce Parameter Object' (bug 102287) for M7. No promise.
Added 'Introduce Parameter Object' for M7 and new API for rename / move in M5.
