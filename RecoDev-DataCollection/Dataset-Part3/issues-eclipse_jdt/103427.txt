Many processors need sourcepath and classpath in their list of -A options, but
it's painful for users to keep track of this in their options. Instead, we
should provide these two options by default with no need to specify it directly.

Added "classpath" and "sourcepath" to options. These are Strings, separated just
as a classpath would be, using File.pathSeparator between each entry.
