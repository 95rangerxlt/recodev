3.0m7
when reading long methods (i.e. somebody else's :-))
it would be useful to immediately see exit points - i'd like to be able to
highlight the method's declard return type and have the exit points highlighted 
(i mean, the normal, 'return' or 'end of method' or 'explicit throw' exit points
- not possible exceptions thrown)

Nice idea.
you can now choose the color of the return keyword.
Got implemented for M9.
