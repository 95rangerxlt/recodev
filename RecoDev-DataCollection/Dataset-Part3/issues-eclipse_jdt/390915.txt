CVS path: www/jdt/ui

Markus, please fill in what we want to migrate and then move the request to the webmaster.
After opening bug 390916 and discussing with Markus, we concluded that it makes more sense to just have one JDT repository for the JDT website.

CVS path: www/jdt/*
ACL: 'eclipse.jdt.core' and 'eclipse.jdt.ui'

The Git repository will deny non-fast-forward and deletions.

Srikanth, please post in this bug what you'd like to migrate.
*** Bug 390916 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I did a few 'du -sk * | sort -rn' and found a few memory hogs, basically in 3 categories:

1) old patches (mostly in the Attic and no longer relevant)

=> I guess we can just remove them from the CVS repo via ssh build.eclipse.org

2) update sites (for internal/supplementary projects like the ASTView, or beta-versions)
3) other larger files/directories (screencasts, code coverage / API tools reports)

=> We can remove outdated stuff, but we need a transparent solution at least for the update sites.

@Webmaster: Can we just create a directory /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/jdt , copy the bigger stuff there, remove the CVS files, and somehow add a soft link at the old location that points to the new location?
How would we create that soft link? Or is there a better solution?

I can certainly create /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/jdt for you, although perhaps archive.eclipse.org would be better if this data isn't expected to change (much).

As for the links, about the only real option is for us to rewrite/redirect specific URLs.  The question then becomes: how long do we keep these redirects?

If links for update site changes we need to also update the links in Eclipse Marketplace - http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ast-view/ and http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/javaelement-view 

(I could do this once the migration is complete)
(In reply to comment #5)
It's hard to believe that we're the first website that hosted a small update site in CVS and now needs a different solution since accumulating binaries in a Git repo is not a good solution. I guess I'll have to replace the update site with a composite repository [1] that points to the new location. 

In the near future, we will also need a BETA_JAVA8 update site, where we post previews of our Java 8 implementation. It's imperative that this update site is not mirrored anywhere outside eclipse.org. I guess archive.eclipse.org is the right place for that.

Webmaster, could you please create /home/data/httpd/archive.eclipse.org/jdt with write access for eclipse.jdt, so we can start experimenting?

For jdt/core, we should move the update site to a different location as binary files don't work well with git.
It should also be a good time to clean up some really old bundles which are completely obsolete now.
So I would say, prior to the move, a cleanup should be done to minimize the size of data being moved to git.
So all what Markus said in comment 3 applies to JDT/Core as well.
(In reply to comment #7)
So people would go to an *archive* URL (http://www.archive.eclipse.org/jdt/) to download a BETA tool (BETA_JAVA8)? Feels a bit odd...
> So people would go to an *archive* URL (http://www.archive.eclipse.org/jdt/)

If the composite repository I mentioned in comment 7 works out, then the archive URL would only show up in the progress view during download.

Or build.eclipse.org
I created a forwarding update site http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/update-site-new
that takes its contents from http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/update-site .

That worked fine, so I'd say /home/data/httpd/archive.eclipse.org/jdt is the way to go.

We need write access for at least "eclipse.jdt", but optimally also for "eclipse.jdt.core" and "eclipse.jdt.ui".

Jay, can you please take a look into this as soon as possible ? TIA.

The last I checked, I don't have shell access. And I guess I will have to request Markus to do what he finds appropriate from the list Olivier mentioned.

You only need to say what you want to move where (confirm/verify Olivier's comment). Then the webmaster (or Markus) will do it.

I have nothing to add to what Olivier and Markus have already listed. So, what stated in comment #3 and #8 should be all.
OK, I'm mostly done with jdt/ui and jdt/apt. Moved stuff that I think we should delete into /cvsroot/org.eclipse/www/jdt/unused/ .

Matt:
I moved a few files/directories directly on the server. This obviously didn't notify the webserver's CVS hook, so some removed files are still available, e.g. http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/update-site-new/build.xml .

Can I somehow trigger a refresh of /cvsroot/org.eclipse/www/jdt/{ui,apt} ?

Jay: OK, so please go and remove the outdated patches, previews, and code coverage reports via CVS. Also remove references to the removed stuff from the web pages.

I've moved the content of jdt/core/tools/jdtcoretools/update-site to the archive and replaced the original update-site with a composite repository that transparently forwards to the repo in the archive.

Stephan: Can you do something similar for the beta-null-annotations-for-fields repo? Just use a modified copy of jdt/core/tools/jdtcoretools/update-site/build.xml and run it in the workbench VM. We can't use the website repo any more to host the update site, so you either have to send me the bits and I can put them to archive.eclipse.org, or you can also host the data anywhere outside of eclipse.org.

Once the checked-out size is down to 1 MB or so, we can ask the webmaster to move everything except for the Attic directories to Git. This will lose history of all deleted files, but that's what we want.

I've forced the checkout to run.

Markus, should I remove it only from HEAD? What about the history and the older revisions if there are any?
(In reply to comment #21)
Yes, remove it from HEAD.

During the conversion to Git, the webmaster will remove all files that are not currently in HEAD, so the removed files will disappear along with all old revisions. Yes, this will also remove the history of other files that have been deleted in HEAD, but I don't think it's really worthwhile to keep deleted files from the website repo.
Srikanth,

We have a couple of junit test results (apparently run on beta Java 7) that are taking about 14 MB of space. Do you think we still need them?

Since we didn't even know these existed, these shouldn't be needed :)
I have removed the following stuff from the site:

1. All under codecoverage - All belong to 3.7 and before
2. All under patches - All from versions 3.5 and before
3. Really old previews 
4. An exclusive update site for a particular preview under r3.4
5. Few old junit test results etc.

Now the entire core folder (excluding beta-null-annotations-for-fields) takes about 1.5 MB.

Note: I have just disabled the links in the pages for the patches, leaving the other information about the patch in tact. It's just not worth for the pages that nobody looks at. If anyone thinks otherwise, let me know.
Oops, I just realized Stephan was not CCd on this bug.

Stephan, can you please read comment 19? Shall I move the three p2 repositories in beta-null-annotations-for-fields to the archive? If you have shell access on build.eclipse.org, you can also do it yourself if you want.

yea, that should hopefully excuse my silence here :)

I would normally prefer to do this in a coordinated fashion between the repos and the wiki plus a note on the corresponding bugs, since these are published
URLS.

So, to double check the solution: I was advised to put this repo into the web-CVS for two reasons IIRC:
- use a URL that clearly belongs to JDT
- don't use a URL that is mirrored so we can remove it in a controlled way later

If www is no longer available I only see this option:
   http://archive.eclipse.org/jdt/

However, my shell access on build.eclipse.org does not buy me write access anywhere in that area.
Have group:
   eclipse.jdt.core
Need group:
   eclipse.jdt

What do you suggest from here?

Also:

Why would I do this rather than just moving the existing repos?

Seems to contradict previous requirements? (see bug 331649 comment 44).
Sorry, with "move to the archive", I meant "move to the archive" + "replace with a composite repository that forwards to the archive".

That way, the public url stays unchanged, and the download location change is completely transparent for users. Since archive.eclipse.org is not mirrored, we keep full control over the the update site and can remove stuff when the beta phase is over.

I just created 
/home/data/httpd/archive.eclipse.org/jdt/core/beta-null-annotations-for-fields
and added write access for the eclipse.jdt.core group. Can you try to touch a file there?

No, it's at the current website location in CVS (in /cvsroot/org.eclipse)

> > and run it in the workbench VM.

That creates the composite*.jar files. Commit them, and the forwarding repo is live.

> > ... or you can also host the data anywhere outside of eclipse.org.
> Seems to contradict previous requirements? (see bug 331649 comment 44).

That was mostly because "objectteams" in the public url looked strange. But for an internal forwarding url, that's OK.

Ah, now I see what you mean :)

I can. Interestingly, ls -l still says "eclipse.jdt" as the group. Is ls just truncating the name at the second '.'?? Nevermind, as it works now.

I'll look into that later today. 
If I have troubles with the ant file I'll just manually create the metadata :)
> I can. Interestingly, ls -l still says "eclipse.jdt" as the group.
That's because I didn't want to change the main group but added the core group via ACLs (use getfacl to see the whole story).

> I'll look into that later today.
Great, thanks. No hurries, we still have a few CVS days left ;-)
All meaty files from beta-null-annotations-for-fields have been migrated to archive and the redirecting composites are in place and smoke-tests done.

(And I learned about running ant scripts in the workbench VM, thanks :) )
Webmaster, we're ready for the ride to Git.

CVS path: www/jdt/*, but without:
- www/jdt/unused
- all Attic folders
- all empty folders, recursively (e.g. /www/jdt/core/codecoverage/ has a huge tree of folders that are only there to contain nested Attic folders)

ACL: 'eclipse.jdt.core' and 'eclipse.jdt.ui'.
(In reply to comment #32)
> Webmaster, we're ready for the ride to Git.

Webmaster, please advise if I should prepare a separate folder with all the content to migrate.

That would be awesome.

-M.
After a few 'rsync -avm --exclude="Attic" xxx migrate-to-git/', all the content for the new Git repo is here:

/home/data/cvs/org.eclipse/www/jdt/migrate-to-git/
Done.  CVS is frozen, and the Git URLs are:

ssh://committer_id@git.eclipse.org/gitroot/www.eclipse.org/jdt.git

http://@git.eclipse.org/gitroot/www.eclipse.org/jdt.git

-M.
Thanks, looks good.

Just one thing: Shouldn't there be a jdt.git/hooks/update file? AFAICS, this is missing in most git/www.eclipse.org/*.git repos.
We don't require the update hook for website repos, but if you want to use it I can certainly hook you up.

Yes, please.
Ok, I've added the update hook to /gitroot/www.eclipse.org/jdt.git .
