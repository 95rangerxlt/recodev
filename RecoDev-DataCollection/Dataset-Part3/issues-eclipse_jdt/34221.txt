The same key ctrl-/ should be used for both comments and uncommenting code. 

If code isn't commented ctrl-/ will comment. If already commented ctrl-/ will 
uncomment it. 

If two levels of comments, uncomment the first, then the second. 

For example 

//this is a comment
////this is a second comment

hitting ctrl-/ would result in 

this is a comment
//this is a second comment

*** Bug 19479 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
We will implement a toggle action. When there is an uncommented line in the
block of selected lines, the action will comment all lines. Only when all lines
are commented, the action will uncomment the lines.
The action is released. There's one remaining issue: there's a dependency from
the toggle action to JavaSourceViewerConfiguration.getDefaultPrefixes(...): if
this method gets changed the action might be broken. It should be able to handle
different prefixes per content type.
Updating Milestone.
Patch for remaining issue is ready - will review & release directly after 3.0 M8
Modified and released Christof's patch.
