Changing the generated source directory in combination with turning project specific settings on and off causes the old generated source directory to remain around on the file system/package explorer

This could be directly related to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=137058 as the problem seems to be that the rebuild doesn't occur when project specific settings is disabled.

To reproduce set up simple annotation processor

1.	Create java project
2.	create new package com.testing
3.	Create new class Testing
4.	Copy paste code sample into new class see below
5.	Add HelloWorld.jar to build path
6.	Add HelloWorld.jar as external factory jar (project properties „³ Java compiler „³ Annotation Processing „³ Factory path „³ Add external JARs¡K
7.	Make sure the project builds
8.	go to Annotation processing dialog (project properties „³ Java compiler „³ Annotation Processing) Change the generated source directory to genDir
9.	click ok
10.	go back to annotation processing dialog and disable project specific settings click ok
11.	notice there¡¦s no build errors and the genDir is still in package explorer
12.	Go back to annotation processing dialog and enable project specific settings and annotation processing, generated source directory should default to ¡¥.apt_generated¡¦
13.	Notice that genDir is still around in package explorer

Code sample 
-----------------------------

package com.testing;

import generatedfilepackage.GeneratedFileTest;
import org.eclipse.jdt.apt.tests.annotations.helloworld.*;

public class Testing {

	
	@HelloWorldAnnotation
	public void myMethod() {
		
		GeneratedFileTest.helloWorld();
		
	}
}

Simple annotaiton processor for @HelloWorldAnnotation

The annotation processor used in repro steps
I can't repro this.  For me, after step 9 I get the "do you want to rebuild" message; if I select Yes, the package and folder are successfully changed to gendir.  Then after step 10 I get the message again, and if I select Yes, the folder is deleted and I get build errors.

Are you not getting the "do you want to rebuild" message at all?  If you are getting it, which option are you selecting?

Also, is there anything in the error log?
Can't repro in 3.2RC2, but I am seeing it in 3.1.2.  Nothing in the error log; answer "yes" to the "do you want to rebuild" dialogs.

Adrian, can you reassign back to me?  Thanks.
here you go
Fixed! 

I now see the "do you want to rebuild" message and the changed generated source directory is deleted when project specific settings is turend off.
