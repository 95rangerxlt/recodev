Not a problem if there's an open editor.
Low prio.
Should save view's state but only apply it if
a) editor backlinking turned off
or 
b) no active editor - can this be tested? depends on startup sequence i.e.
editor before browsing parts or vice-versa

Added code which (re-)stores the selection. However it is not yet perfect
because normally the views listen to selection changes and show the state of the
currently selected element in the workbench. This can cause conflicts:
- editor shows x()
- another view has focus where y() is selected
- the Members view reads z() from its store
==> what is the right choice for the Members view?

Need to think a bit more before releasing this one.

If there's an active non-Java Browsing part it might override the saved
selection because the Java Browsing views show/track the selection of the active
part.

Fixed.
