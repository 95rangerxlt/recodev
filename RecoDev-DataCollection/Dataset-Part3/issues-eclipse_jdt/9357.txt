I registered a label decorator to mark binary projects imported using PDE 
Import wizard with an overlay in upper-left corner. The decorator works in the 
Navigator, but not in the Packages view. I set 'adapter' property to true and I 
am checking both IProject and IJavaProject objects. It looks like decorators 
are not checked for project icons. 

Do you plan to support this?

This was a desktop bug which Tod has fixed.
PDE decorator is now showing up in Packages view (as of integration build 0212).

Taking liberty of marking as fixed.
