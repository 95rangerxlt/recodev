Content Assist: Ctrl should toggle insert/overwrite not Command. The preferences page is correct, but only the Command key actually toggles the mode.

Fix

Here's a fix. I found the places to update via a call hierarchy on org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PreferenceConstants.CODEASSIST_INSERT_COMPLETION.

The modifier should probably been made available somewhere. Currently, it's black magic that's spread over CompletionProposalPopup/CPP2 and implementations of ICompletionProposalExtension2.apply(..).

That would be a separate bug. Feel free to file one.
