Using build 20011219.

With “Preferences/Java/Editor/Code Assist/Automatically add import instead of 
qualified name” option set.

When creating an @link in a javadoc comment us Code Assist to select a type 
name that is not referenced in the current file.  Notice that an import 
statement for the type is added (as would be needed for @link to work with 
types referenced via the –link javadoc option).

Now choose “Organize Imports” in the Outline view.  Notice that the import 
statement for the type referenced only from the javadoc @link entry is removed.

Type names are now always fully qualified in javadoc comments (if needed), 
instead of adding an import.
