BUILD: M4

When opening a class file with <CTRL><SHIFT>T I can't search any thing out of 
that file.

Example:

I have a simple project. Now I open the class LineNumberRulerColumn via "Open 
Type" dialog (<CTRL><SHIFT>T). Of course the type doesn't exsists as source 
file, it opens the binary type and uses the attached source file for displaying 
the source.
Next I select class name "LineNumberRulerColumn" because I want to search for 
all references to this element. Right click on "LineNumberRulerColumn" -> 
Search -> References -> Workspace. Then an error dialog pops up "This operation 
in unavailable on the current selection. Please select a valid Java element 
name.

By "simpe project" I mean a simple PDE Plugin project.
Works for me using the following steps:
1.  Start empty workspace
2.  Open New Project wizard and select "Plug-in Development - Plug-in Project"
3.  Press Next
4.  Enter "Test"
5.  Press Next
6.  Press Next
7.  Select "Plug-in with an editor"
8.  Press Next
9.  Press Finish
10. Press OK
==> build path OK, no compile errors
11. Open Type LineNumberRulerColumn
12. Select "LineNumberRulerColumn" in the declaration
    Note: Step 11. already selects this
13. Context menu (or global menu): Search -> References -> Workspace
==> gives results.

Maybe you have build path errors in your workspace which prevent code resolve
from working correctly.

Mhm. Did you try using the Required Projects container? 

Yesterday I discovered some strange problems using this container. I seems to 
be a bug in the initializer (already reported) Maybe I was using this by 
default and that was why I had this problem.
>Mhm. Did you try using the Required Projects container? 
No, I used the described test case. If you have build path errors due to
classpath container problems then this probably caused the behavior you reported
here. This behavior is OK: if the build path is wrong then code resolve might fail.

I have to reopen this bug because I have the same behavior on a complete 
different machine with a complete different workspace setup and a newer build 
(I20030115).

The workspace is configured for running a feature based "Runtime Workbench". 
Thus, all Eclipse plugins exists as binary projects in the workbench. In my 
plug-in projects the classpath is set correctly to point to the binary 
projects. The imported plugin projects are imported without extracting their 
sources.

I can open any type with Ctrl+Shift+T (open type dialog) that is expected to be 
in a binary plug-in project (eg. org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PreferenceConstants). The 
type's class (eg. PreferenceConstants.class) file is opend in the editor, its 
source is resolved correctly and the outline view displays its structure.

But as soon as I click somewhere in the editor (I have enabled sync editor-
>outline) I see an error text in the status line indicating, that the current 
selection doesn't resolve to an java element although I have selected an Java 
element. But the sync. outline->editor works fine.

If I right click any constant (in PreferenceConstants.class) in the editor and 
select Search->References->Workspace NOTHING is found. Even references in the 
same file are not found. Same happens when I right click in the Outline view 
and select References->Workspace.

The classpath is resolved correctly. I double checked. All my plugin projects 
build without any errors.

The log file is empty.
Gunnar,

would it be possible to share that workspace with us or at least provide exact
steps to produce a workspace which shows the problem?
Thanks.



This might be possible but I have to share my home workspace. I will build a 
clean workspace and clarify steps to repeat before I share it. But it will take 
some time.
Sure.

Please note that M5 is next week. After that we go into a freeze mode where most
likely this bug won't be fixed anymore for 2.1.

I know, but I didn't have a chance to reproduce it consistently. It occurs 
after working a while not right after startup.
I think I found why the search was not working. I searched for a public static 
final member of a class. Results can only be found in source files, or in 
binaries where the constant was not inlined. Thus, the search result was empty. 
Although source code was attached only the ".class" files where indexed. That's 
why I couldn't found any reference 
to "org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PreferenceConstants#EDITOR_SYNC_OUTLINE_ON_CURSOR_MOVE"

The first time you search for such an element Java Search reports this in a
dialog. You can then chose not to show the dialog again which you probably did.

Can I close this PR?

Mhm. I think the dialog is different. IMHO the default behavio was "Do not show 
the dialog next time".

IMHO you can close the PR. I didn't experienced anything similar using the 
latest builds.
Unless the user explicitly checks the check box the dialog comes back. I
attached the dialog for you ;-)
