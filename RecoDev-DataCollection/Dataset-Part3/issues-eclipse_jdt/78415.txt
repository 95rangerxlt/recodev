In build I20051111, I did a search for a particular java method which resulted 
in 304 matches, some of which were potential matches. There did not seem to be 
a way to hide the potential matches. I would have expected either a "Remove 
all Potential matches" context menu item or a filter but found neither. I did 
find the global preference to ignore potential matches but turning this on did 
not effect my existing query. I would need to rerun it which seems unnecessary.
