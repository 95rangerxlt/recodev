Build 3.0M6

It seems that shift+Space is hooked onto code assist action, same as ctrl+space.
I couldn't find it being defined in the default key binding set I am using.

Is this on purpose or a bug ? At least it should be documented, and disablable.

Tom, you have added a new kebinding with the sequence Shift+SPACE. Is this on 
purpose ?
Shift+Space is bound to incremental completion, which is the same as content
assist if there is no common prefix. However, Shift+Space is not a very lucky
choice as it interferes with typing -> will have to change.

Adjusting summary accordingly.

- removed keybinding for incremental completion
- to use it, bind it to a key of your liking (e.g. replace the standard content
assist action with it).
(- does not make sense to bind to some complicated key sequence)

- there is also a problem with the key-binding engine that would execute the
action even if only Space was pressed, not Shift+Space.
