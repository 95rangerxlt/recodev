3.4 M6

'org.eclipse.jdt.junit' got new API in 3.4 (before M6)

We forgot to increase the plugin version number, detected this in M6 and fixed this (21.4.2008) but forgot to ask for PMC approval .

Asking the PMC to approve the change.

The only API added for 3.4 is:

org.eclipse.jdt.junit.model.ITestElement.getElapsedTimeInSeconds()

returning timing information of the test run. It is good to have for interested clients, but not required internally.
+1 for version upgrade to reflect reality.
The version number got updated for 3.4 M7
