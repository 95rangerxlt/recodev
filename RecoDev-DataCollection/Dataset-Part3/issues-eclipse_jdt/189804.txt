To reproduce:
1. Create a new workspace
2. Import the preference file attached
3. Create a new Java project (without enabling project specific settings)
4. Create a HelloWorld class with method braces on same line as method signature
5. Select all the code and run the code formatter

Expected:
Braces are moved to line below signature since this is what the code formatter is setup to do

Actual:
The custom code formatting is not applied

Work-around:
Open the General Preferences windows and navigate to the code formatter option
Notice that the SJM custom code formatter is selected in the drop down
Select another code formatter then reselect the SJM code formatter
Hit OK on the preferences window
Now the code will format correctly

Seams to be related to the old version of the profile/profile is not updated
I think its because the preference file only contains the profiles, but not the actual jdt.core settings. I assume you handcrafted that preference file.
So either leave a way the '/instance/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/formatter_profile=_SJM' key and manually switch the profile or include all jdt.core formatter settings in the profile as well.
setting to invalid. please reopen if you didn't handcraft that file.
It works fine when exporting and importing all preferences. The problem is, that we have a 'Java Code Style Preferences' category which claims to contain all the Java > Code Style preferences. However, it does not export the formatter settings of the compiler along with it. When importing, we do set all the code style settings, including the formatter ones, but this does not get transferred to the compiler.

Possible workarounds:
- export all (or at least also the compiler) preferences
- export and import the profiles directly via preference page
- open the preference page, switch to another profile and back, click 'OK'

We should export the org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter entries ("/instance/org.eclipse.jdt.core/org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter...") also while exporting "Java Code Style Preferences".

Tested that the attached patch works fine when preferences are exported and imported with either all or only "Java Code Style Preferences" checked.

Dani, please have a look.
