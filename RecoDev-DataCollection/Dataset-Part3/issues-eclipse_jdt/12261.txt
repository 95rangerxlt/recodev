build 20020321

Adding a method to a java file I get an SWT error and a dialog pops up asking 
if I want to exit Eclipse because of an Internal error. The log file is 
attached. I could not isolate the problem but I do have a workspace that 
reproduces it. If you need the workspace and the steps to reproduce, just let 
me know and I can put somewhere else or send by email.

Rodrigo,

You must have inserted a template to get that error. Can you be more specific
how you added the method? I don't need the whole workspace. I would just need
the file which produces this error with the exact steps to reproduce it.
I don't remember inserting a template (though I used code assist a lot). I 
could not reproduce with a 20020328 drop but can still reproduce with a 
20020321. Do you want me to try to isolate the problem anyway?
Do you have the 'work in progress' option 'Fill argument names on method 
completion' checked? Its implementation changed in the latest drops.
If that is the case, I'd be interested in having a simple reproducible case,
as the bug would be still there, but just not showing up in your case.
Yes, I had that option on. Here are the steps to reproduce:

+ fresh 20020321 install and workspace
+ check the options:
  + 'Fill argument names on method completion'
  + 'Hide Text Hover'
  + 'Show source of selected element only'
+ create a Java Project "Bug"
+ add 'ant.jar' to its java build path
+ create a class Test with the following contents:
//==============================================================
import org.apache.tools.ant.Project;

public class Test {
	
	public static final String PROPERTY = "p";
	
	protected void A() {
		Project project = null;
	}
}
//==============================================================

+ click on method A()
+ only that method is shown
+ make sure the class is saved
+ follow the steps bellow *without* saving the file
+ make sure you type the code bellow in the order it is written and do not 
copy/paste
+ add a second line to the method:
		setProperties(project);
+ add a method (bellow the current method but leave the focus on A())
	protected void setProperties(Project project) {
		project.setProp
+ use code complete and something like the following line will show up with 
the first parameter selected:
		project.setProperty(arg0, arg1)
+ write PRO as the parameter and use code complete to get PROPERTY:
		project.setProperty(PRO, arg1)
+ select the next parameter using CTRL+SHIFT+RIGHT_ARROW and type ""
+ the exception is thrown and a dialog shows up

If you have any problems reproducing, let me know. Note that you have to 
follow the steps exactly as they are described, otherwise the problem do not 
show up.

I managed to reproduce it. Will investigate.
