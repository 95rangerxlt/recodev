I20070920-0936, follow-up to bug 197999

The last fix fixed the scenario from attachment 74708 (applied on org.eclipse.search v20070724-0800). But there are still issues if you
- apply the change to FileSearchPage.java
- replace the strings by "open" & "sort" (or "o" & "s")
- externalize the strings again

I think the main problem is that NLSUtil.compareTo(String, String) uses
'counter - diffLen' as value, but it should only consider length differences as a secondary criterion. I'll attach a patch with test cases that solves the remaining problems.
