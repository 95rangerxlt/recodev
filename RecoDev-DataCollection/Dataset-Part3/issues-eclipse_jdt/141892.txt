I will attach a patch with a draft "what's new" document for JDT for 3.2. This is essentially just the union of all new & noteworthy docs from the milestones.  I have done some minimal organizing and combining duplicate entries, but it needs further revision.  I haven't verified that all the content is still accurate, or that the screen shots are still correct.

NnN revision 0.0.1

This is a first draft for the 3.2 N&N for JDT UI/Core/Debug/Text.

The screenshots are not up to date and are just placeholders for the yet to come real screenshots.

There is a section 'To be removed' at the end of the document with topics which I will remove, unless someone wants this topic in the NnN. Of course other topics can be added/removed as well.
IMHO we should not remove the following items:
- Refactoring preview filters
- Rename subpackages
- File content decorator
I would keep the section entitled: "Internal Java model cache function of the max heap size". This is important for users that have large .jar files on the classpath. Maybe the title should be: "Improving performance with large .jar files".
Also the following items should not be in the Compiler section:
- Command line code formatter
- Completion in Javadoc comments
- CamelCase support in search engine
- Support for Java-like extensions

A new version has been released to HEAD

Changes:
- Completion in Javadoc comments

        Not exciting anymore;-), renamed to Refactoring History, moved after create scripts and export Jar file

Various changes in text
I believe 'suspicions' should be replaced by 'suspicious' in the explanation of null reference analysis.
I updated the debug section and re-did screen shots (for debug). Is there any way we can reference the 'what's new' in the platform? It also has debug stuff in it, that might be relevant to JDT.
A new version has been released to HEAD

changes:
- Added link to platform_whatsnew
- replaced suspicions with suspicious
- Moved platform changes to platform_whatsnew
- Using same thin black line as seperator as platform_whatsnew is using
marking as fixed. Dani is currently doing another pass over 'What's new', but I think we're more or less done.
