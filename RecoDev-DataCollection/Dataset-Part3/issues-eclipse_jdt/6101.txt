- create this class X.
  <----------------------------->
  public class X {
     public class Y extends X {}

- do a build.

there is an error : Cannot use this in a static context

same test case with
  javac 1.3 : OK
  javac 1.2.2 :
     X.java:2: No constructor matching X() found in class X.
             public class Y extends X {
