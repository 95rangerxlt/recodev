The menu option Source > Override Methods... should be renamed Source > 
Implement Methods...

1.  When I implement a method defined in a superclass, such as toString(), it 
is my decision whether to extend the superclass' implement, by calling 
super.toString() at some point, or to simply override the superclass' 
implementation by providing my own.  Regardless of what I choose to do, I am 
IMPLEMENTING a METHOD, not necessarily overriding a method.

2.  When I implement an interface I am certainly not overriding a superclass' 
implementation, so why should I expect to use the Source > Override Methods... 
menu option to help me.  When I implement an interface I'm providing 
IMPLEMENTATIONS of the interface's API.  I am NOT overriding the interface's 
API.

In Eclipse 1.0 there was a context menu option on the Outline called "Add 
Unimplemented Methods", which seems to have morphed into "Implement Methods...".

This is a JDT/UI issue.
Move to JDT/UI for consideration.
The action has been renamed to Override/Implement methods

Why not name the menu option "Implement Methods..."?  The term "implement" 
suffiently covers both "extend" and "override".
