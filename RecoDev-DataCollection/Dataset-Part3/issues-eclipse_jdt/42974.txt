The menu item Source > "Generate Getter and Setter..." is named inconsistently. The 
dialog box that appears when you select this menu item is titled "Generate Getters and 
Setters" (Getters and Setters are both plural). The context menu item when you right-click 
is also named "Generate Getters and Setters..." (plural). The Source menu item should 
also presumably be made plural.

Action should be named Generate Getters and Setters.
