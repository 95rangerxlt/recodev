Build 20020508

When you create a new Package it is not shown in the Packages View until you 
create some content (like a class). This is very confusing as it looks like the 
creation failed.

STEPS
1) Create a JavaProject Foo
2) Create a package Bar
3) Not visible
4) Create a Class BarClass in Bar
5) Package becomes visible

works for me.
Create Project ZZZ
Add Package XX
-> XX shows up properly
On further investigation this is a Linux-only issue. I can't replicate on Win 
2000.
Claude, can you please try to reproduce the problem on Linux?


works for me on 20020508, Linux-Motif
I have found specific steps required to produce this. It appears to be related
to the existance of a non Java Projects

STEPS
1) Create a simple project Foo
2) Create a Java Project Bar
3) Create a package foobar
4) package will not show up

Note that this does not occur if both projects are java projects
It still works for me using 20020508-I on Linux-Motif. Is it the way we invoke 
the wizards? I used context menu in the navigator/package view to create the 
projects and the package.

I did it all from the workbench window menu.
just tried that. It still works. I used a fresh workspace.
I was also doing this in a self hosted image. I will try again after todays 
build and see if it still happens.
Works in build 20020515
Verified.
