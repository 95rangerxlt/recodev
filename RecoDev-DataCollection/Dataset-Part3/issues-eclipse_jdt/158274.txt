AptConfigurationBlock uses JDT/UI's internal class ListDialogField, which has been changed to fix bug 157085. Consequently, you now have a compile error with APT and JDT from HEAD.

I thought I'd better file this, since it will only become apparent tomorrow when nightly builds are restarted after the milestone builds are over.

Please fix in HEAD and relase the plugin before the I-build on Tuesday (but not now, since that would interfere with the milestone :-).

I added the method back for compatibility. It's marked as deprected. Please let me know when you changed your code.
Thanks for the heads-up, Martin.

I think that the setViewerComperator() method is spelled incorrectly.  It should be spelled with an 'a', just as the ViewerComparator type is.  That is, setViewerComparator().

Do you want to fix that, before I add a call to it?
Oh, thanks Walter, you're right. I fixed this in our code (> 20060925).
Fixed in HEAD
