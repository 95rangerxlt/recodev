I find it very useful to colorizes interfaces and abstract classes with the same color with JDT built in syntax coloring.

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to assign different colors for classes and abstract classes in preferences->java->syntax coloring->element->java.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open a java source file containing references to classes and abstract classes and try to assign different colors.

Thanks for the patch! I'll take a look during M5.
Thanks for the patch Björn. It's looks quite good. There are only some minor issues:

- I don't like to use the same color as for interfaces. Please choose a
  new, not yet used color.
- In the preview: use "AbstractClassName" instead of "AbstractClass".
- The comment on the following line:
      new ClassHighlighting(), // includes abstract classes - fallback
  is misleading: it will not include abstract classes if the class is detected 
  as abstract and the abstract SHL is enabled.
- Please add a tests to org.eclipse.jdt.text.tests.SemanticHighlightingTest
  (in org.eclipse.jdt.text.tests).

Done - I set it to 139,136,22. I assigned the same color as for interfaces because abstract classes and interfaces are often used quite interchangeably.
> - In the preview: use "AbstractClassName" instead of "AbstractClass".
Done.
> - The comment on the following line:

Done. Set it to: // before classes

org.eclipse.jdt.text.tests.SemanticHighlightingTest.testAbstractClassHighlighting() adopted.

Done.
Thanks!

Committed the patch to HEAD with updated copyright date (2011).
Björn, the properties file does not like 'ö' in it. Do you prefer "Bjorn" or "Bjoern"? I used "Bjoern" for now.
Bjoern is ok.
