The method private static IChange createDeleteChange(ICompilationUnit cu, List 
javaElements, TextChangeManager manager) throws CoreException should only 
build a partial AST since it doesn't need the body of all the methdos. Enough 
is the body of the method to delete or may be we can skip this one as well. 
Problematic might be local types.

Can not be changed since the methods can delete more than one Java element. 
Additionally it also handles anonymous types.
