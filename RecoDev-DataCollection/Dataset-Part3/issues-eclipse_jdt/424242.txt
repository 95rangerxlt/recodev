Fix

Example:

    void foo(java.util.Set<Integer> set) {
        set.removeIf((a, b) -> { });
    }

See bug 424154 about the first error message.

The second error is:

	set.removeIf((a, b) -> { });
	             ^^^^^^^^^
Lambda expression's signature does not match the signature of the functional interface method


This message doesn't contain enough information to quickly fix the problem. It would be good to include the actual functional interface method, so that a user (or a quick fix) immediately knows what's expected. Improved message:

Lambda expression's signature does not match the signature of the functional interface method test(Integer)
