Sorry if this is a duplicate of the one I wrote this morning as I did not get 
any confirmation. My browser didn't show the confirmation either.

Earlier I had requested this feature and I was told that API did not support 
this kind of search.

I recently discovered CTL-1 mechanism and found that it allowed me to rename 
local variables. I see an opportunity here. If CTL-1 can rename all occurances 
of a local variable, data member etc, it should also be able to provide an 
option "highlight all occurances" in the same drop down box. It is a natural 
place as before I rename I should be able to view all occurance that I am 
renaming.

I hope this makes sense and will fulfill a long time request to bring about 
ease of development and maintanance of code.

We have released a Search>Occurrences in File action that does exactly what you 
want (it highlights references and indicates in the search result view 
read/write access). There is bug in that the action doesn't show up in some 
circumstances, but the short cut ctrl-shift-U works in the Jan 07 integration 
build.



How about the intutiveness of having "show all occurances" in the CTL-1 menu
as a menu item?

Could we add it there to make user experience seamless?



By the way, I tested the Shft-CTL-U, looks good.

However, it shadows the CTL-1 mechanism. When you locate occurances of some 
Java element using shift-ctl-u, and subsequently perform a CTL-1 on that 
element, which search matches exist, the dropdown shows "No corrections 
available"

If you "remove all selected matches", and then perform CTL-1 on the same 
element, now it allows "rename" as an option.

Obviously just a minor defect.

Thanks for the feature.
Regarding the shadowing...
It looks like quick assist just checks whether there is a marker at the range 
it should also check for the marker type. Martin pls check whether my theory is 
correct.


Fixed the shadowing > 20030108

For now we don't have the plan to add "show all occurances" in the CTL-1 menu. 

Here is a piece of code to describe the bug:

Bug1:
    public void waitForProduction() {

        Object rCV = MyAnonProducerProxy.getCV();

        while (MyAnonProducerProxy.isNothingOnQueue()) {
            synchronized (rCV) {
                try {
                    rCV.wait();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    System.out.println("!!!Exception=" + e);
                }
            }
        }
    }

1. Highlight rCV and press SHIFT-CTL-U
2. Don't let the highlight go away
3. All occurances will be highlighted correctly
4. Now since the highlight is already on rCV, press CTL-1
5. The drop-down does not appear (BUG-1)

Bug 2:
abstract public class AnonConsumer implements Runnable {

    private AnonProducerProxy MyAnonProducerProxy;
    private MtQueue MyQ;
}
1. If I highlight MyQ declaration above, and press SHIFT-CTL-U, none of the 
subsequent occurancess (not shown above) are highlighted.
2. This means Highlight is working only for references and not declarations for 
Data Members.
3. For local variables, if you press SHIFT-CTL-U on a declaration it works 
properly.

=====================================================================

Must also not that CTL-1 mechanism is broken as well. 

1. If I highlight MyQ declaration above, and press CTL-1, drop down does not 
show. Only shows for references.


Useful additional observations that may help:

Highlight all occurances for Local variables or Data Members, display similar 
behavior.

If I have 

		Vector	    v;

as a local variable or a data member, Highlight all occurances does not work.

However, if I have:

		Vector	    v = new Vector();

It works.

Important: Please note that the same observation applies to CTL-1 mechanism for 
rename. If left uninitialized, both locals and data members show "No Correction 
available" (which is wrong as well). Initialized, the show "Rename"

Thanks,

Vinay
Vector scenario works now
