BindingLabelProvider#getTypeLabel() does not qualify a type even if
SHOW_QUALIFIED flag is set. The implementation should match the one from
JavaElementLabels in order to also handle anonymous subtypes of interfaces
correctly.

Markus, do we currently need this somewhere in the user interface. If not we can
postpone it > 3.1
I wanted to fix bug 77850 and use BindingLabelProvider instead of
BindingLabels.getFullyQualified(IBinding).

BindingLabels.getFullyQualified(IBinding) is currently used in
UnimplementedMethodsCompletionProposal and for a few error messages.
We can also stick with the old implementation and clean this up later. We can't
switch now, since type names would then be unqualified in error messages, which
is not acceptable.

BTW: The optimal solution would be to create a class BindingLabels that fully
matches functionality and configurability of JavaElementLabels.
Support for package fragment root is not easily doable
Added package qualification
