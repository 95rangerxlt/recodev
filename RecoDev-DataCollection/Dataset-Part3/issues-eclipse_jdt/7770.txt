During the course of new Java project wizard, you are called upon to specify 
source root and build output destination. However there is no support to browse 
to locations for those. Users who are migrating existing projects from other 
IDEs may have their project folder structures already set, and will want the 
browse-to capability. 

To Reproduce:

1.	Open WSWB
2.	Create a new Java Project
3.	After naming the project hit next
4.	The next window allows you to specify the source and if you select use 
source folders contained in the project notice you have no browse support to 
select an existing project folder.

Expected Behaviour:

The user should be able to browse to an existing project folder.

This can be achived by creating the project in the location of the existing 
project (there is no need to import the code). To do so uncheck Project 
contents to not use the default location. Once you do so you can browse the 
source folders. 
I was wrong, the Add Existing Folders... only shows up when opening the 
properties of an existing project. 

Add Existing Folders should also show up when creating a new project.
At the project creation time, the workspace does not yet contain the resources, 
so they can not be browsed.

I think the approach to go for creating projects from existing source is to 
offer an import wizard.

Import isn't the right approach, since when the project already exists on the 
file system it is not natural to import.

We should rather offer an action: compute source folders on the source folder 
page. This action can check whether a non-default location is used and if it is 
should access the non-default location directly.

new capability based project wizards create the project so the resources should 
exist (or can be created with a refresh from local)
added capability wizard. You can create now a project on a existing location 
and in the build path page you can browse to contained folders/files
