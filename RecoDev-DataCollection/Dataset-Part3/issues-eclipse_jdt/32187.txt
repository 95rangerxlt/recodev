It would be nice to right click a package from Pacakge Explorer and see a 
Source menu similar to the Java Editor's context menu.  It would contain menu 
items for Organize Imports, Format, and Sort Members (as well as their

The most common source actions are inlined into the menu of a package fragment. 
The use of a source sub menu was rejected for 2.0 and we shouldn't change it

Can be reconsidered for 2.2.

Got fixed for 2.1
