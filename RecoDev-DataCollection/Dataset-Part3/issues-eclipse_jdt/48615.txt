Javadoc formatting formats up non-javadoc comments and should not. We have our
license text at the top of each source file in /* */ comments. Source/Format
formats these comments and should not. This is not good for our project since
all of the license text formatting is blown away.

For example, paste the following in a Java file and format:
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/license.html

Version 3.0.m5.

You can uncheck "Format header comments" to avoid having licences and such at
the beginning of a file formatted. Please reopen with detailed steps to
reproduce if that does not solve the problem.
[Thanks for the pointer, eclipse is so feature rich!] Here is what happens for
me, I have now unchecked the "Java/Code Formatter/Comments/Format header
comments" checkbox. This:

One more question: is the header comment at the very beginning of the file, or
is there anything in between the beginning and the comment (package declaration,
empty lines, etc.)? From browsing the code, I believe the current detection
algorithm simply checks whether the comment starts at position 0.
I can also reproduce this simply by having at the first available position 1,1
(the position displayed at the bottom right):

/*
 * BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
 */
package com.seagullsw.appinterface.soap; 
<snip>

turn into:

/*
 * BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
 * BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
 */
package com.seagullsw.appinterface.soap; 
<snip>

Hm, it seems that only javadoc comments are considered for the "don't format
header comments" option. This should really be vice versa, formatting only
javadoc but not multiline comments, but was probably made this way to accomodate
the (admittedly wrong) javadoc comments in eclipse source files...

The fix is not format any header comments, neither javadoc nor multi-line comments.

fixed in source, not sure whether this will go into M6
