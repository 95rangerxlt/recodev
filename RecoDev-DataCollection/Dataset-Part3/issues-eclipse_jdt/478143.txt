A part fix added here http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA9 - the code change in this line is corrected to include the module rather than the path - Fix not complete - in progress

This is the correct link with the commit id: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA9&id=12825866d75439e3f74d81246a4ee0c748270ebd

A normal search also has similar issues (not finding matches in other modules) after the  commit of bug 473901 - if the root cause is found to be same as of this bug, relevant changes for that will also be addressed here without an additional bug.
Code commit: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA9&id=6b8f4e4e8de49124d87e0699e016b5f8e7ecbd15

The index file modified to include the module name - and corresponding changes done at the create index and decode index entry codes in TypeDeclarationPattern and QTPD.

Note: Once we have the jigsaw (b81 I believe - b82 does not seem to have) available, the example module implementation at the source module-info.java and the corresponding class needs to be addressed. moduleName field is already added to the SIRequestor - This needs to backed by ISERequestor.acceptModule() called to be addressed in the compiler - separate bugs will be raised for the same.

known issue: the history table of dialogue opens the old history - a click on the same doesn't yield the class - 
(Spawn an eclipse - Search for Image [ to be found in java.awt  - module: java.desktop; 
Close the eclipse;
spawn again;
Select the first Image (and not the one under Workspace matches - the issue can be seen) - 
Need to be analysed to check whether this is ui issue - assuming this is handled entirely in ui - in such a case, the module name may have to persist in history of ui) or the module parameter is missing.

The module name is persisted with the docname and hence the index file need not be modified - A part of the earlier commit then now becomes redundant and hence that part has been reversed using the following commit: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA9&id=98ea7b5c884ea38db2971ba16b50553929fbb7a3
the history issue referred in the earlier comment is not there with this patch. Also, With this,  the index file format remains the same (The removed parts essentially correspond to the changes in the index file format and its manipulations)
Fixed
