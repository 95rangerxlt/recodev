When the hierarchy view has no corresponding selection, it shows the 
message "Use 'Open Type Hierarchy' to see the type hierarchy of a selection."  
Several testers (and myself) find this message confusing, especially since the 
aforementioned menu choice is not apparent.  Could it be reworded?

For example, "Select a class from the Navigator view, then use its 'Open Type 
Hierarchy' menu choice to display its type hierarchy here."

A similarly confusing message is shown for the Type hierarchy, the difference 
being the suggestion to select 'Focus on...' (from where?!?).

Changed the message to:
'Select a type (for example in the outliner), and use its 'Open Type Hierarchy' 
menu choice to display its type hierarchy here.'

Great, didn't expect anyone to look at this (our testers will be very pleased)!

'Select a type (for example in the outliner), and use its 'Open Type Hierarchy' 
menu choice to display its type hierarchy here.'

Your wording is better than my suggestion, although I think that "Outline view" 
may be better than "Outliner".  I've not heard that term used before, and it 
doesn't match what is in the menu choice.  It is always safer to go with a 
known term, otherwise the translator may put "yellow pen used to show important 
text" <g>.  Seriously, we see stuff like that all the time.  Latest 
example, 'plug-in extension' was translated as "plug-in [file] extension" 
(i.e., they thought it was another kind of file extension, like BAT, CMD, XML, 
etc).
