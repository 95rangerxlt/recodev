Performed code formatting at project level containing more than 100 Java files.

Expected: The code must be formatted as per the template.
Actual: The formatter threw exception saying: Some characters cannot be mapped using "Cp1252" character encoding. Either change the encoding or remove the characters which are not supported by the "Cp1252" character encoding.

There are two problems here:
1) The root cause for the exception
2) The exception details are not enough - it doesn't state in which file the exception occurred. Now I have to dig through all the files one by one.

-- Configuration Details --
Product: Eclipse 2.0.0.20130613-0530 (org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product)
Installed Features:
 org.eclipse.jdt 3.9.0.v20130605-2000

Sure. You can get to the log either by opening the 'Error Log' view in your IDE or locate it on the file system:
<your workspace>/.metadata/.log
