Given:
    Object    o   =  (String )  o;

And following save actions enabled:
- Remove unnecessary casts
- Format changed regions

First scenario:
1. Edit the line by i.e. adding a space
2. Save
Here it is clear what should happen:
 - Remove the cast
 - Format the line

Second scenario:
1. Edit any other line in the document
2. Save
Is:
 - Remove the cast
 - Format the edited line, but not the one with the cast removed
Should:
 I say the is behavior is the expected one! But it could also be possible to:
 - Remove the cast
 - Format the edited line
 - Format the line with the removed cast

The first scenario is the one I've fixed (see CleanUpPostSaveListener#performWithChangedRegionUpdate). The problem there is that the remove cast and the format clean up generate overlapping text edits. The solution is to perform the changes of the remove cast clean up. Then calculate the format text edits on the changed document. But this requires to update the regions when performing the changes from the cast clean up. This is a must fix.

Besides the fact that the second scenario is hard to fix, I would like to close this bug as invalid because clean up on save does already behave as expected.

Maybe all we should do is change the name of the option to 'Only format edited lines'

Martin, Markus what's your take on this?
I think only the user edited changes should be formatted.
The other clean up options are handled by the AST rewriter which tries to make minimal changes and use formatter settings.
OK. In that case we should
1. format at the beginning
2. remove the fallback code that adjust the changed regions
3. adjust the preference label
> I think only the user edited changes should be formatted.
+1.

> 3. adjust the preference label
For me, "changed regions" already means "the regions that QuickDiff marked as changed before I saved the file".

It doesn't hurt if we are precise. Also, what you say is not 100% correct as quick diff might lack behind.

Yes, I think I can do that, to reduce the likelihood that the changed regions must be adjusted.

That's not fallback code... Code formatting and comment formatting are two clean ups which may generate overlapping edits (bug 102780). Adjusting the regions may therefore still be required. I also think that it is very likely that we're going to support changed regions for other clean ups (I just need to figure out how to do the UI). 

> 3. adjust the preference label

Yes, I think 'changed regions' is too generic. At least it should read 'changed lines'.

CleanUpStressTest says no. Problem is, that a clean up can change the length of lines (i.e. add qualification, remove cast) which can lead to adding or removing line breaks when formatting. The AST Rewrite can not/does not add/remove line breaks in this situation. That's why the formatter has to run at the end.

Changed the name of the option to 'Only format edited lines'
