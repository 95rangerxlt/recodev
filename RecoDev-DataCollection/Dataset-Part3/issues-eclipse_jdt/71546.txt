Moving to Team. Please advise if there is something JDT/UI can do. 
I have verified that the jar file decorator is updated in the navigator view 
but not in the packages view. What happens when the file is committed is that 
CVS sends out a label change for the JAR file. Any views that are showing the 
resource need to handle the label update event by translating it to an update 
on the logical model element representing the resource. My guess is that the 
Packages Explorer ins not translating the resource update into the java model 
element update properly.

Assigning back to JDT UI to investigate further. I did a bit of debugging and 
when the ResourceToItemMapper#resourceChanged methid is called with the jar 
file, there is no object mapped.
Should be addressed for 3.1.
