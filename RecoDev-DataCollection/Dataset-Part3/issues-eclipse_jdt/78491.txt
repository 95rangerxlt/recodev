Starting with 3.1M3 the JUnit component suddenlty tries to execute tests from
abstract classes:

class abstract AbstractTestCase extends TestCase {
    public void testDefaultTestHere() {}
}

class ComponentWithDefaultTest extends AbsractTestCase {
    public void testComponentSpecificBehaviour() {}
}

In former releases only the fixtures of ComponentWithDefaultTest were executed,
3.1M3 tries now to instantiate AbstractTestCase and fails obviously.

Move to JDT/UI
Erich, can you please comment. This might be related to the fix Erol put in. 
I agree, Dirk.

The bug is in class TestSearchEngine.findTestCases(...)

A check is necessary to find out wheter a class is declared abstract or not 
before adding it to the list of found classes.

I will have a look at it.

Patch avoids finding of abstract test cases

Martin, maybe you can have a quick look at this patch.
How should I apply this patch?

Stephen, you will find the fix in next week's I-build (I20041123 or similar)
