2.1.2

we now allow canceling the call setRawClasspath (see bug 43692). What should 
canceling really do? Canceling the build or also reset the classpath to its 
old values ? 

Philippe, can you comment on what Java Core is doing here.

Isn't the cancel only supposed to cancel the build (if autobuild is on) ? Then, 
I would leave the classpath as it is.
Dirk, what was the intent of the PR?
For 2.1.3 we allow canceling build path changes. If the user now presses the 
cancel button, the build gets canceled, but not the class path change. This 
means we can have a strange situation:

- user changes class path
- press OK on dialog
- cancels the build
- press Cancel on dialog.

==> observe: the class path is changed although the dialog got canceled. 
fixed the prefpages to return back to the page when the cancel button is pressed
