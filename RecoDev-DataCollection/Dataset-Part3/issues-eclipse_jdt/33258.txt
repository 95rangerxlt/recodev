Build 2.1 RC1

1. Select IAction.run
2. Refactor->Push Down
==> neither busy cursor nor progress is shown even though the system is frozen
for more than 6 seconds (and I have one of the faster machines).

Note: Same might be true for other refactoring with pre-checking.

I guess you are constructing a type hierarchy in this case. Why is this 
necessary. If the class doesn't have any sublcass we can show the error in the 
refactoring dialog during precondition checking. It isn't very common that 
users activate this action on a type without subtypes.
