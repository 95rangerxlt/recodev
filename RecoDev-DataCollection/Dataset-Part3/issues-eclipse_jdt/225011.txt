Kim, I saw you updated it already but this change wasn't released into the map file for M6.
As a consequence, some products requiring Eclipse 3.3.2 will refuse to install on top of 3.4M6, because "org.eclipse.jdt" from 3.4M6 looks older than 3.3.2 required version.

Given 3.4M6 is important for early access to 3.4, and testing, we should reconsider this for a M6 respin.
Could the product requirement for 3.3.2 be lowered to 3.3.0 ? It could still ship along with 3.3.2 if it wants, but if it allowed to run on 3.3.0, then org.eclipse.jdt from 3.4M6 would still be compatible.
Discussing with James, it appears my previous comment is not an option.
This fix will also be in 3.4 M6a.
+1 for 3.4M6a
NOTE: I've also update the feature to include the platform 3.4 feature and to get a new qualifier (otherwise M6a would have the same version as M6).
I ran the 'remove_p2.sh' script on the eclipse sdk from 3.4 M6a build I20080407-1555 and ran some smoke tests. The fixes look good there.
