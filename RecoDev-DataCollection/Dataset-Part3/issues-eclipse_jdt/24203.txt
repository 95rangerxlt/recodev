In build 2.1.M1 If you have a comment like so:

	/** A groupId that indicates a message is for any AIS. */

And you hit the ENTER key where "[ENTER]" is indicated:

	/** [ENTER]A groupId that indicates a message is for any AIS. */

You get:

	/** 
	 * 
	 */A groupId that indicates a message is for any AIS. */

Instead of:

	/** 
	 * A groupId that indicates a message is for any AIS.
	 */

We could either
- only complete if there is only a whitespace right of the cursor or
- not complete when a modifier is pressed.
The latter is part of current investigation as there is more than one case in 
which it should be simple to temporarily disable smartness.
This has been fixed a while ago.
