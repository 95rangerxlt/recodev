{@link xxx} tags in Javadoc should be rendered as <code>xxx</code>.

The Javadoc tool generates <A HREF="..." title="..."><CODE>xxx</CODE></A>. The full fix (supporting links in Javadoc hovers and view) is bug 8112, but the rendering should be easy to fix and would already make the Javadoc a lot easier to read.

Example:
/**
 * {@link Try}, {@linkplain Try}, {@code Try}
 */
public class Try { }
