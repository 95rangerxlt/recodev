As far as I can see, there's no documentation for the templates which appear on 
the Preferences|Java page. They look jolly useful, but at the moment I've no 
idea how they work... There's no mention of them in the Reference|Preferences 
section of the Java Development User Guide, either.

This is a new 2.0 feature.

Define the template in the preference page. 
The defined templates show up in code assist when the prefix matches a template 
name. 

For templates with variables check out one of the "for" templates and use it in 
the editor
Right - I'd got that far, but had missed that the code assist matches the 
template *name* rather than any *code*.

Also it took me a couple of guesses to see that tab is the key used to traverse 
the elements within things like the "for" template.

Looks like a great feature though.

fixed now
