Martin,

can you comment on this. I thought the same when I saw the dialog.
We can change it to 'Modifiers'
Created attachment 5144
proposed fix.

Changes wording to "Modifiers"
Adam, do you agree with that fix? For the refactoring 'Modifiers' is not really 
the correct term.

Adam, can you decide and release the path?
fixed with patch for bug 38400
(refactoring not touched by the change)
