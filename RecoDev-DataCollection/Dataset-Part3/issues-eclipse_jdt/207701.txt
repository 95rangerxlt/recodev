Add UI for new compiler option COMPILER_PB_UNUSED_WARNING_TOKEN (see bug 127533).

The new warning from bug 127533 caused a test failure in jdt.ui's ModifierCorrectionsQuickFixTest. I've fixed this by ignoring the new option in org.eclipse.jdt.testplugin.TestOptions.

I've also moved the tag to avoid breaking the next I-build.
