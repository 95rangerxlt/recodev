F1 linux-gtk, but assume that this happens on all platforms.
Either the decorators are on top of each other or it's a single decorator which 
is not very recognizable.

Also, the override/implements icon looks ugly when the item is selected. The 
border color should not be white. It should be more like the public icon, which 
looks good both on bright and dark background.

The synchronized decorator on dark background looks ugly, too.
the override indicator got fixed.
we should avoid the overlap of the override indicator and the synchronize 
indicator. To do so we shift the synchronized icon to the left in this case. 
The problem is that the implements and overrides indicator are now rendered 
using a decorator and decorators don't know how the image looks like. 

Possible solutions:

- don't use decorator for override and implements
  hard to make it API and user customizable then
- render overrides and implements at different position
  Test, but couldn't find good position.
- make synchronized implements and overrides icon the same size so that they
  hide each other

Suggest to go for option 3. Moving to Erich so that he can take care of 
ordering new icons.
option 3 implemented.
