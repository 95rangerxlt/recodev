The Quick Fix for a missing method creates a method and JavaDoc for it. If the 
method has 1 or more input parameters a @param tag is added for each parameter. 
Parameters have a default name (e.g. 'i', 'j', ... for integers). 

When creating the method you can 'tab' through the parameter names to change 
these to more meaningful names. However, when you do so, the corresponding 
@param tag is NOT renamed accordingly.

This has been seen in M8 (and M7 as far as I remember).
