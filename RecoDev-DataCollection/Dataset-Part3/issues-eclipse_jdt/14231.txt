Before migrating to the M5 build, I was using 20020321, and have found that 
the "Fill argument names on method completion" I can no longer tab from arg to 
arg.  I really miss this feature in M5.

On a related note, I'd like to suggest that args that get filled actually be 
the variable names of same type variables in the enclosing class.  This might 
be a lot of work though.
