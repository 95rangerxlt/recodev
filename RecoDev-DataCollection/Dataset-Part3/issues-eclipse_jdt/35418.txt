Just FYI: If you have the following type of code:

if(true)
{
  //do something
}
else //and place an inline comment here
{
  //do something else
}


and you place a comment on the same line as the else, when you do a code format
the code looks like this

if(true)
{
  //do something
}
else //and place an inline comment here
  {
  //do something else
}


with the bracket after the else indented with the rest of the code.  If you
remove the comment, it does fine.
