Follow up for bug 115814. 
Pref label could be: "Comparing identical" and should be categorized amongst potential programming problems.
Summary:

Added a new compiler warning to detect comparisons between identical expressions. This diagnosis is controlled by option: JavaCore.COMPILER_PB_COMPARING_IDENTICAL and produces a problem marker which ID is IProblem.ComparingIdentical problem ID.

Compiler option ID: Reporting Comparison of Identical Expressions.
When enabled, the compiler will issue an error or a warning if a comparison
is involving identical operands (e.g 'x == x').
  - Option id:"org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.comparingIdentical"
  - Possible values: { "error", "warning", "ignore" }
  - Default: "warning"
