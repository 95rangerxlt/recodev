The following JDT user docs are in the reference toc file but the html files being pointed to do not exist.

/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/shared/ref-wrap.htm
/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/shared/ref-details.htm
/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/details_pane/ref-details_pane.htm

The user will see broken links when trying to view, and help will log errors when trying to index them when doing a help search.
