As of build 20021203 the eclipse workbench will now support declarative fonts. 
This will eliminate the need for the PropogatingFontFieldEditor.

There is a new extension point fontDefinition for defining fonts so that they 
can be viewed and managed by the workbench fonts preference page. There is 
also a defaultTo attribute which when set keeps the entry for the 
fontDefinition consistent with the defaultsTo entry if the preference for the 
fontDefinition is not set.

For example if a font called org.eclipse.myplugin.textfont had a defaultsTo of 
org.eclipse.jface.textfont the value in the font registry for 
org.eclipse.myplugin.textfont will be the same as the value for 
org.eclipse.jface.textfont until the user sets a preference for 
org.eclipse.myplugin.textfont .

see the org_eclipse_ui.fontDefinition doc for more details

Tod,

what is the best way to be informed about font changes? Normally an editor from
plug-in X only listens to preference changes of plug-in X's store. Is there an
easier way than adding an additional listener to the Workbench's store (just for
the font)?

I guess best way is to add a listener to the font registry - right?

Fixed.

Note: I had to add a little hack in UIPlugin (see bug 28725).

Verified that workaround has been removed.
