1) Start the "cast" template
2) In the type field enter "istruc"
3) Press Ctrl+Space to Code Complete
4) Press <tab>
5) Press <down arrow> (to selected IStructuredSelection)
6) Press <enter>

You will notice that cursor is now next to the type field, the type name was 
not completed in the cast and the template has been abandoned.

If you skip step (4) it will work OK and you will stay in the template.  This 
is a rather subtle difference and it took me a while to figure out what I was 
doing wrong.  Perhaps either pressing <tab> should do nothing or pressing <tab> 
should not cause the template to stop.

The observation is correct. Linked mode (the UI of which is what you see when
entering a template) has a whole bunch of exit conditions to avoid staying on
when it is not needed. One exit condition is the display of another shell. Since
linked mode really does not know anything about content assist, it will assume
some dialog has been opened and exit.

There is another problem even: if IStructuredSelection is not yet in the import
structure, then choosing it from the proposals will add the import, which will
cause linked mode to exit, even if step (4) is left out.
This has been fixed for M2
