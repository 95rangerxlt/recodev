Using build 200211191210, I got into a state where the Java editor for a 
particular class was very slow and everthing I typed was backwards. I could not 
close the editor in question due to bug 26953 but I could close other java 
editors and typing in other editors worked fine as well. I had to restart 
Eclipse to fix the problem.
