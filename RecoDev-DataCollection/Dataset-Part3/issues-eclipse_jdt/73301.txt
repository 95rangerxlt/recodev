Version: 3.1.0
Build id: 200408122000
N.B. Reported against version 3.0 as there isn't a 3.1 version in the list yet!


If you hover over a method-local variable, a popup appears describing the type
of the variable.  Unfortunately, if the variable is an array, the number of
dimensions shown is incorrect.

e.g. "class Test { void foo() { int[] bar; } }".  Hovering over "bar" will
produce a popup saying "int[][] bar - Test.foo()".

The dimensions appear to be doubled - a variable declared as "int[][][] foo"
will be described as "int[][][][][][] foo".  Appears to work fine on class
variables, even when referred to inside a method.

Well, I can :-)  Thanks for the link to the bug reporting guidelines, very
interesting.  I'm not sure what more information I can give you that isn't in
the above, though.

a) Build ID is supplied above (200408122000).
b) JVM seems irrelevant, but FYI it's Sun JDK 1.4.2-b28
c) There are no related entries in the log file.
d) Preferences are largely unchanged from default.
e) Not a formatter problem.
f) Editor is the Java editor.
g) Steps to reproduce problem can be implied from above, but to be more specific:

Steps to reproduce bug:

1) Open Eclipse
2) Create new project "Test"
3) Create new class "Test"
4) Wait for editor to open
5) Change file contents to match the following:

public class Test { void foo() { int[] bar ; } }

6) Save file (may not be necessary)
7) Hover cursor over the word "bar"

Will attach a screenshot of the problem.

Hover-over popup showing incorrect array dimensions
This was in some of the I-builds but has been fixed since then. Use
I200409011200 or newer.
