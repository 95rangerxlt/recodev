Organize imports has started adding the following classes to files that don't
use them:
import sun.security.krb5.internal.i;
import sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.e;
import sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.f;
import sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.j;

This happened most recently when I performed "organize imports" on
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.JavaHotCodeReplaceManager after adding a
reference to IMarker to the class.

Is this a dupe of bug 6977 ?

Either way, I am haing the same problem as described in bug 6977
*** Bug 7848 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

Just browsing through the bugs I am associated with.. and it seems to me 
that "LATER" is the definitive answer for this, and it can be marked as a 
duplicate of bug 6977 and closed.
