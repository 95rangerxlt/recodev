- new/clean workspace
- checkout platform-ui projects and compile
- Java Perspective
- open a class (ProblemView)
- in Outline view, click the buttons 'Hide Field' (so you don't see the 
fields) and 'Sort'(so methods appear in alphabetical order)
- Outline view is updated
- open another class (SelectionEnabler)
- note that the 'Sort' button is depressed in the Outline view but the 'Hide 
Fields' button is not (so you see the fields)
- click on 'Hide Fields' and the fields are hidden
- open a 3rd Java class (PluginAction)
- 'Sort' button is depressed but 'Hide Fields' is not - I wasn't dreaming the 
first time!
