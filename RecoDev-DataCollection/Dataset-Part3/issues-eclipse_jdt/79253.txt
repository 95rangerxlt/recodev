tried to refactor by extracting interface, and failed to produce correct interface.

class was like:

"public class GenericOutput<K extends Serializable, V extends Serializable> { "

and when i extracted interface, i got:

"public class GenericOutput<K extends Serializable, V extends Serializable>
implements MyGenericOutput {"


... should have been:

"public class GenericOutput<K extends Serializable, V extends Serializable>
implements MyGenericOutput<K extends Serializable, V extends Serializable> {"

thus, generic interface methods in MyGenericOutput immediately threw compiler
errors (generics were stripped out, leaving types like 'K', 'V')

thanks!

3.1M3 seems better than 3.1M2... keep up the good work!

Move to JDT/UI
