Cannot disable the Java compiler project-specific preferences for some projects.

Steps to reproduce:

1 - check out from CVS a Java project that has project-specific Java compiler
settings enabled (example: org.eclipse.core.runtime).

2 - open the properties dialog for the project, select the Java compiler node,
disable project-specific Java compiler preferences.

3 - Commit the changes by pressing "Ok" and reopen the properties dialog. It
looks like the settings were not saved (project-specific settings are still
enabled).

*** Bug 94484 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Might be related to bug 92123?
I'm not using node.remove(), so I don't think so
reason is bug 94926. I added a workaround for bug 94926 and fixed a releated
issue: when turning on project specific settings without applying any change,
the next time it would show workspace settings again
