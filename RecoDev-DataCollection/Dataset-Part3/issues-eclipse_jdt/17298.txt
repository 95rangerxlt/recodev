On a CU with multiple imports and the Caret in one of the imports, it is not 
possible to collapse the import Decl. treeitem.

0519 build.  Outline and source view must be set to sync in each direction, 
probably.

Window only (Not Motif).
Also happens in Members view (Java Browsing perspective)
Note: moving cursor to end of last import line allows the tree node to collapse.
I believe this was fixed at end of 2.0 cycle
I'm running 2.0.2 and this is still present. Hope no-one minds me re-opening it
until it is shown to work in 2.1 or 2.0.3 comes around.
Has been fixed a while ago
