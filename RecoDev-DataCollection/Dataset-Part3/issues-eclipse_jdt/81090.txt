The context menu has some minor inconsistencies:

- "Show Diff": Preference page mentions "Quick Diff". The terminology should 
be consistent at both places
- "Line Numbers": Like "Show Diff", this is a show command and should be 
named "Show Line Numbers"
- "Folding": The submenu entry "Expand all" could be renamed to "Unfold all", 
since expand/collapse is used in other contexts (like tree items)
- "Preferences...": This entry should be in a separate section

For M4 it would be nice to have at least the Preferences... menu entry separated
since it is a new feature. Note that "Properties" in the context menu for a Java
elements is separated too. This menu group would be perfect. The same problem
exists in editor context menu: Preferences... is along with Team, Compare and
Replace.

All points are valid and should be fixed as this is the first appearance after 
the preferences rework.
