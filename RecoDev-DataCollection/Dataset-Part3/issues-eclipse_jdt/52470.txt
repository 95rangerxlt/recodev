Steps:
- Open Java Browsing Perspective
- Open CallHierarchy
- single-click on source location
-> observe: JavaBrowsing Views lose their JavaElement

IJavaElements for selected source positions.

Hi Jesper, please tell me if you want to make a patch, so we can avoid duplicate
efforts. 
Hi Markus,

Sorry, I meant to write that I would look at it but forgot it. I hope to be able
to fix it during the weekend.

Thanks, Jesper. Released your patch to HEAD.
