The package explorer support two transfer drop method :

LocalSelectionTransfer
FileTransfer

It could useful to support PluginTransfer. 
Plugin developers could then use the 'org.eclipse.ui.dropActions' extension point.

Fix. Not sure if this is a good idea though, the feedback from the PluginDropAdapter is weak: Dropping is always enabled, no way to know if a drop is possible before the drop took place. Its also not possible to feedback what kind of operation is possible (copy, move, link)
