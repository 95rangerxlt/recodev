The "Local Rename" quick assist should not automatically select the whole name.
The complete name to be renamed should still get the green underline.

My normal use case is this:
- I see a variable "varFoo", which should be renamed to "varBar".
- I select "Foo", but then remember that I should use a Local Rename.
- I press Ctrl+1, and my selection is destroyed :-(

+1

This is a real pain. In almost all cases the cursor is placed to a location
where I don't want to type. It should use the current caret position and
selection untouched.


+1 - if I really wanted the name to be selected, I'd simply do a shift-alt-
up...
Martin, any comments ?

rename in file will now set the cursor to the end of the linked word


Why to the end of the linke word? Why not simply retain the current position???
you're right. The end of word makes sense when the rename in file is reached 
through a quick fix (bug 75193).
