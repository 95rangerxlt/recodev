Build 20011127+ latest JDTCORE
---------------

(1) Define project with source folder 'src'

P
+- src
    +- X.java with content:  [class X {}]

+- bin

(2) Full build of P
  Notice that P/bin/X.class was created ok.

(3) Edit X.java and add package statement [package p1;]

(4) Incremental build of P
  Notice that:
   a) No complaint was issued about the fact X.java is located incorrectly
       with respect to its package statement.
   b) P/bin/X.class is still there (wrong)
       though P/bin/p1/X.class was added (ok)

Fixed by adding notion of expected package name on compilation units.
