Build 3.0M5

Currently, in order to select a different flavor of a JRE container, one has to 
select the project, find the build path tab, then library tab, then select 
container and edit it.

It would be far simpler if it offered properties directly on the JRE container 
element in package view.

We added a 'Configure..' action on build path containers once. I believe this was for 3.1.
