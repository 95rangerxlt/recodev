In the JUnit view there is a button with the tooltip "Rerun Failed Tests - Failures First". But the button actually runs all my tests, not just the failed ones. So either the tooltip or the behavior are incorrect, I don't know which one.

Fixed in HEAD. Corrected the tooltip to "Rerun Last Test - Failures First".
