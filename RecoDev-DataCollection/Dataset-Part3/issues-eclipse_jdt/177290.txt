Build I20070313-0800.

While modifying a javadoc comment, the Javadoc view is not refreshed when I remove only characters using the 'Suppr' key. The view is well refreshed (ie. including the suppressed characters) if I hit any other keyboards key (add characters or move the cursor).

Note that the view is well updated when deleting characters with the 'Backspace' key or if the selection is not empty while hitting 'Suppr' key.

This was a general problem with the firing of the post selection.

Fixed in HEAD.
