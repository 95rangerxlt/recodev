Build 205

Attempting to patch a binary project. I manually expanded its sources in a
source folder, and then force a refresh from local.

Then immediatly, I tried to open the type I wanted to patch, I got a dialog
indicating that indexing was still in progress. 

I then cancelled my action (open type), and got a "No types available".
Tried again later. The dialog came up again with "No types available", even
though indexing was finished by then.

It seems to have cached the empty list, and I remember this bug around 0.9.

put a fix for 206
cache is not reused when last result was an empty list - this sould fix it.
will ask Philippe to verify it.
