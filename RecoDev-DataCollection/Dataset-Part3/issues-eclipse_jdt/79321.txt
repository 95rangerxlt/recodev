I200411230838 and before:

- Preferences > Java > Compiler: set compiler compliance level to 5.0 and check
'Use default compliance settings'.

- Uncheck it again => the two 'Disallow identifiers...' combos become enabled -
they should stay disabled with setting 'Error'.

- Set source compatibility to 1.4 and back to 5.0
=> 'Disallow ...' are OK now.
