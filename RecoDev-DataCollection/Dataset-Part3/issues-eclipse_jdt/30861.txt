Build 20030129

When no element in source is selected, it will fail, opening an error dialog, 
which then needs to manually be closed. This is disruptive and should be 
handled consistently with open on selected or code assist (no match simply 
rings the bell and provide info in status bar).

Got fixed for the next integration build.
