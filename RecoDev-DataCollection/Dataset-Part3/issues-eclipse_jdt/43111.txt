There should be a view for system properties currently set. This would aid 
designing classes that work with these properties. If it is in Eclipse 
already, I am not able to find it.

Are you talking about System.getProperties(). If so you can either use the 
scrapbook to evalute this expression or you can write your own view if 
necessary.
If I wrote a view to do this and donated it, would you include it? I think it 
would be a nice handy tool. Often I am lookign up what system properties are 
set to what values. 
I think we wouldn't include it in the Eclipse SDK since it seems a little bit 
to specific for me. But I would like to encourage you to write the view though 
and provide it thru the Eclipse plug-in web-page http://eclipse-
plugins.2y.net/eclipse/index.jsp

Implements system properties view along with custom system properties.

I wrote this plugin to accomplish the task. I would be happy to donate this to
the eclipse project. 

Features: 
+ A view to view the current system properties. 
  + Regular expression based filtering of the system properties
    based of jakarta-regexp
  + Refresh action. 
+ A preference page to set and edit custom system properties that
  the user wants to set in the workbench. These properties are
  persisted between workbench invocations. These properties can be 
  used to set developer specific information such as email address 
  in multideveloper environments. This allows these properties to
  be available to things such as source formatters to add custom 
  author tags.
Reopening to resolve as fixed.
Fixed by a plugin.
