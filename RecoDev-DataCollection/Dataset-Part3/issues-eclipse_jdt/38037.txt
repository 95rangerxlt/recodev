The Sort Members operation is visible from the Source menu, but not from the
context-sensitive (right-click) menu within the source submenu. Other items,
such as Format and Comment are present, but Sort Members is suspiciously 
missing.

Don't know if Format/Sort Members are going to be merged into one in the 
future, (Tidy Code?) perhaps in bug 37496 but should be put into the source
context-sensitive menu until such changes occur.

Same is true for the alt-shift-s shortcut.
This is in 3.3 already.
