patch for BETA_JAVA8 branch

Currently, the version of org.eclipse.jdt.annotation_v1 in the Git repository is "hard coded" down to the qualifier. 

I suggest it be changed (back) to 1.1.0.qualifier so it can be "built like usual" from Git.

patch for BETA_JAVA8 branch

Currently, the version of org.eclipse.jdt.annotation_v1 in the Git repository is "hard coded" down to the qualifier. 

I suggest it be changed (back) to 1.1.0.qualifier so it can be "built like usual" from Git.
I will mention an alternative, one I might even want to use eventually, and that would be to put that bundle in the eclipse-sdk-prereqs.target file, pointing to the exact version in the the 4.3 maintenance repo. 

But, I'd prefer for now to leave it "open", such as we might want to make other changes ... such as export version on the package, or something.
BTW, in this patch, I forgot to include the change to the pom ... which, of course, would have to be changed to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT. 

Sorry about that.
Wow, yet another error ... in the patch, I see I misspelled "qualifer" instead of "qualifier". 

Apologies again, but I hope easy enough to fix without new patch?

Sure, I will take care of those.

Actually the patch has it right ("qualifier")
