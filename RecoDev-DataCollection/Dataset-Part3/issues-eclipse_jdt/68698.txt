i dont know if this is allowed or not.

Compiling this code leads to the problem.
The AST conversion has nothing to do with it. This code is illegal, but it is
not rejected properly.

class Display {

  public interface Bla {
    void a();
  }
  
}

public class Test {

  void aMethod() {
    Display display = null;
    display.new Bla() {
    };
  }

}

Javac 1.4.2 reports:
Test.java:13: qualified new of static class
    display.new Bla() {
            ^
Test.java:13: <anonymous Test$1> is not abstract and does not override abstract
method a() in Display.Bla
    display.new Bla() {
                      ^
2 errors

Jikes 1.18 reports:
Found 1 semantic error compiling "C:/tests_sources/Test.java":

    13.     display.new Bla() {
                        ^-^
*** Semantic Error: The interface "Display$Bla" is not an inner class.




QualifiedAllocationExpression did not properly handle this incorrect code (did 
not check that the actual target had no enclosing type).

Addressed in both 3.0.1 and 3.1 streams.
Added regression test InnerEmulationTest#test116.


Verified for 3.0.1 RC1
