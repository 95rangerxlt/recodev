The specs for ITypeBinding and IMethodBinding do not cover all the cases that 
need to be handled in JLS3. The particular area that the spec must cover are 
instances of generic type and generic methods.

IBinding
- getKey() - added clauses in spec to cover new JLS3 bindings

ITypeBinding
- revised/clarified specs for various methods to explain how type bindings can 
arise from instances of generic types (parameterized type references and raw 
type references)
- clarified getTypeParameters() to say that these do not show up on the 
binding for instances of the generic type

IMethodBinding
- added isParameterizedMethod(), isRawMethod(), getErasure(), getTypeArgument()
- clarified specs for to explain how method bindings can arise from instances 
of generic method (parameterized method references and raw method references)
- clarified getTypeParameters() to say that these do not show up on the 
binding for instances of the generic method

Olivier, Please reopen if the specs need further changes.
