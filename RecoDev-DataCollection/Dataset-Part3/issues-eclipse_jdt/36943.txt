I think this API can also support source generation, and not just refactoring
current code. 

For instance, one operation I'd like to use (and code) would be "generate a
constructor that initializes all final fields with parameters." This is a
repetitive task if you have a lot of value objects in your project.

For us (Visual Editor for Java) an important API that needs to be opened up is
the capability of renaming an variable within a method. Currently this is done
through source range and is an internal API. We thank you for already opening up
the rename of an IField. We use that and it works great. But we also need to
rename variables. Source ranges is sufficient, just we need it as API. Thanks.

With 3.0 there are two new plug-ins available, ltk.refactoring.core and 
ltk.refactoring.ui which allows clients to implement their won refactorings 
using the same infrastructure.

The goal of this PR wasn't to make more JDT/UI refactorings API. I opened bug 
68625 for comment #3.
