Categories (from @category Javadoc tags) should be colored in colored labels.
See e.g. IJavaSearchConstants from HEAD.

I quickly did it with the COUNTER_STYLE, and I like the outcome. Maybe the style name should be generalized a bit, e.g. to CONTENT_STYLE with label
"Colored labels - content description".
