On the following 2 cases, with cursor located at <|>, quickfix did not find 
suitable replacement (was expecting 'someField').

public class X {

 int someField;

 void foo(){
  s<|>omFi = 12;
 }
}

public class X {

 int someField;

 void foo(){
  this.s<|>omFi = 12;
 }
}

quick fix is not code assist (we are using a different similarity 
algorithm). "somFi" and "someField" are spelling wise far appart. The goal is 
to find typical typos, e.g. missing character, transposed characters, mistyped 
characters. A soundex based algorthm could improve this, but the current 
behaviour is acceptable and it has lower prio to improve this.
