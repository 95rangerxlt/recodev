It would be really awesome to be able to have a simple spell checker for the 
javadoc comments. Ss experience shows that some of programmers who have english 
as second language might benefit from such feature tremendously.

Moving to JDT/UI for comment.
defer to after 2.0, but this would be great and excellent opportunity for an 
external contribution.
[javadoc]
Reopen for investigation
was on the wishlist of others too!

or newer bugs along the same line:

Since I can't find Genady's ideas from 16Nov2001, some thoughts from my side:
1) It should use an open source spellchecker such as aspell 
   (http://www.gnu.org/directory/aspell.html).
2) It should allow to remember ignored/accepted words on a per document basis
   Ken Stevens's ispell has the nice approach that in a specially crafted
   (non-javadoc for the purposes here) comment, both the language used on the
   document and such words are remembered
   (see: http://www.kdstevens.com/~stevens/ispell-page.html, k.stevens@ieee.org)
A Spell Checker should be selectable for:
  - Javadoc Comments
  - Non-Javadoc Comments
  - Strings

Should this be closed now taht 3.0 has shipped with a spell check feature? Even
though it does not include a word list?
Has been implemented for 3.0.
