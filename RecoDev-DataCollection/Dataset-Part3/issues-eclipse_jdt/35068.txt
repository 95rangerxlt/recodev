Pressing dot/open-bracket doesn't always complete on the current-selection. For 
example type:

  Sys<ctrl-space>.e<ctrl-space>.

(the second <ctrl-space> shouldn't be required see #31246)
This gives

  System.e.

"System" is completed correctly by pressing dot, "err" is not.

Also ( works for types and methods with parameters, but not for methods with no 
parameters.
Regarding comment 4:
- that ( is not working is per design. As you might see = also only works at
places where it makes sense. In contrast you can complete using ;
- please file an enhancement request to support "+ - / * < > & | ? : ^ % ) } ]
!" as well.

OK I've raised the other symbols as bug 49552, but I don't understand why ( 
isn't a valid symbol to complete?
