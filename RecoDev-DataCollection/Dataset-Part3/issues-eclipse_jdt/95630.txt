See the DEBUG variable in APTDispatch.  I think we want this to be consistent 
with whatever is done in JDT and whatever is done via the APT config ui that 
is planned. 


This is fixed now.  We may still need more tracing statements, but we have 
infrsrastructure support for enabling tracing in teh same way that the JDT 
core does.
