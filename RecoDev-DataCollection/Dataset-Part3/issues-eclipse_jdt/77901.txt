The Java "refactor" operation for changing the name of a class misses a certain 
kind of reference to the class: the Java construct Foo.class, which returns the 
instance of class java.lang.Class for class Foo.

1. Create a valid, complete Java class called "Foo" in a source file Foo.java.

2. In a method of Foo, add this line:
   Class dummy = Foo.class;

3. Save the Java source file.

4. Right-click on the *.java file in the Package Explorer

5. Choose Refactor > Rename

6. Enter "Bar" as the new class name

When you look at the result, you'll see that "Foo.class" was not changed 
to "Bar.class" as it should have been.

Markus, please investigate. 
Cannot reproduce with I200411042000.
Allan: What's your build id? Are you sure that the 'Update references' checkbox
is checked?
Possibly I did not have "Update references" checked. When I make sure that 
option is checked, I can't reproduce either.

It seems like "unchecked" is the default for this option - at least it was for 
me in Rename Class (and Rename Method, now that I try it). I think that's 
wrong. As I see it, whole power of Refactor/Rename is that it updates 
references! And having this option unchecked breaks your program, which 
probably isn't what you meant to do.

When I "rename local variable" and don't check "update references," I get a 
dialog showing the Java errors that will result. This makes it clear that I've 
broken my program and should re-check my options. But that didn't happen for 
Rename Class or Rename Method, even when there are references in the very class 
file I'm changing.

If the default for this option is really "unchecked" then I will change this 
bug (or file a new one) to say "The default should be to update references for 
all refactor operations where it's an option." Please advise.

Up to now, the setting of the 'Update references' checkbox was saved whenever a
rename refactoring was executed. Since most users most of the time want to
update references when they execute a refactoring, I changed this to be always
checked by default from I20041109 on.
