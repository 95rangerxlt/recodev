Build Identifier: 20100617-1415

I followed the cheat sheet "Create a Hello World SWT Application" and downloaded the SWT Binary and Source Package for Windows 32 Bit (swt-3.6-win32-win32-x86.zip).
It is not possible to import this package as project (as described in the cheat sheet) because the files .project and .classpath are missing in the archive.

As a workaround I used the archive for Eclipse 3.5 imported the project and the replaced the files by the content of the archive for 3.6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the package swt-3.6-win32-win32-x86.zip
2. Try to import the SWT project from the main menu via File > Import..., and select Existing Projects into Workspace. Specify the archive file you downloaded and click Finish
3. This process will fail.

The step to import the SWT project from the zip is no longer valid. The cheatsheet needs to be updated.

Please follow the below steps:
1) Extract the swt-3.6-win32-win32-x86.zip file
2) The extracted folder contains 2 jar files swt.jar and swt-debug.jar
3) On the Java build path page of your project, open the Libraries tab. And add the swt.jar as an external jar.
Thanks for reporting this. Keeping this bug open to update the cheatsheet.

cheatsheet

The steps in HelloWorldSWT cheatsheet need to be updated.
Lakshmi, for quite some time the step to download is no longer needed: one can simply import the SWT project(s) via 'Import Plug-ins and Fragments'.

Can you update the cheatsheet (patch) accordingly? Thanks.

Hi Dani, I have modified the cheatsheet accordingly.
Thanks!
Committed to HEAD.
There are other problems related to this change. The "Developing SWT Applications Using Eclipse" page on the SWT main web site needs to be updated, too.

Please file a bug against SWT. We (JDT) have no access to that.

The original problem happens in the 3.6 & 3.5.2 builds. It has been fixed in 3.6.1. Please see Bug 323600 
You'll be able to import the downloaded 3.6.1 package as a project.
