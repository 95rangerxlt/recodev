Changed order of validation

The same error displayed as well for ?\? and ?/? file names. The reason that validator displayed the ?already exists? message was that the full path of target file was identical with parent directory. I?ve moved validation of the name earlier and now validator displays correct message.
Moving to JDT/UI.
Well, the original problem is in IContainer.findMember(String): it specifies to find the members with the given *name* but there is no member with name "". Looking at the implementation, the method actually treats the name as path. I've filed bug 329373 to track this.

Having said that, the patch works and I've committed it to HEAD (including updated copyright date).
