It can be reproduced with a normal Java project.If you create a Java              
project that mimics what happens with an annotated ejb client JAR                 
project (as in RAD v6 or v7)then you can reproduce the problem.                                       
Specifically, if you create a Java project with the 'gen/src' as the              
source folder than you can reproduce                                              
this problem with any Java class.                                                 
                                                                                  
Note: 
I just created a simple folder structure in a java project                  
TestBobDJava with: gen/src and made "src" ( as in gen/src)  the source            
folder under Java Build project properties.I also specified an output             
folder "bin". My java class was bobd.com.BobDJava.                                
On export as a jar file with the default options I get:                           
                                                                                  
JAR creation failed. See details for additional information.

The problem  looks to be with the 'gen/src' source folder structure.
              
This only happens when you export a JAR using the option:                         
'Export generated class files and resources' 
                                     
but works properly if you use the option:                                         
'Export all output folders for checked projects'.                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
This occurs in RAD v6.0.1.1/Eclipse 3.0.2 and in RAD V7/Eclipse 3.2.1.

Moving to JDT/UI
This works for me using plain Eclipse SDK 3.2.1 with attached test case.

There can be duplicates if you select to export class files and sources together, but then the dialog should only be a warning dialog telling that problems occurred and the JAR should be generated anyway.

Archive with test project (use import 'Existing Projects...')
Ref: but then the dialog should only be a warning dialog telling that
problems occurred and the JAR should be generated anyway.

So there is still a defect since you do not get a warning but an Error [X] dialog:
JAR creation failed. See details for additional information.                    
  Problem writing /TestBobDJava/bin/bobd/com/BobDJava.class to JAR:             
duplicate entry: bobd/com/BobDJava.class      

AND

you can never enter [Finish] successfully! A clear UI defect
When using 3.2.1 I get a WARNING dialog (see attache picture).

Please don't reopen again unless you provide
1. exact steps to reproduce the problem
2. a picture showing the dialog you get
Thanks.

Created attachment 58022
Error dialog - export jar creation

I will also shortly attach the project folder, which you can import as an existing project.
Your "gen" project does not refelect the error I reported. You need a prpjects structure such as is common with annotated j2ee projects: {"my java project" folder} > "gen" folder > "src" folder , as was originally described.

TestBobDJava-Project folder-Eclipse312-RADv7.zip

This zip contain the java project TestBobDJava.
Unzip and Import as an existing project inro an eclipse 3.2.1 workspace (note: same problem exists in Eclipse 3.0.1).
- RC > Export as a jar : select "Export generated calss files and resources" as per the screen shot
and choose a jar file destination.

- push [Finish] : Error Dialog pops up
This shows the error:
Please see attached jpg and my existing project folder zip as per the two previous appends conatining teh attachments and comments
Can reproduce now.

The problem is that we get the class file for BobDJava.java through two paths:
- as CU from the package fragment root TestBobDJava/gen/src
- by traversing the resources of TestBobDJava/gen

We check whether we are traversing resources or the Java elements.

When exporting just the source BobDJava.java is also exported twice but there we only get a warning and not an error.
Is there any progress on this defect ?
Please update us, as we are awaiting the fix.
Can this be fixed for 3.3.1 ?
I juste realized that the problem from the example in comment 8 got fixed for 3.3. 
Do you still see a problem? Can you attach that use case?
Time out for 3.3.1. Note that it looks like "worksforme" any way.
This got fixed for 3.3. Please verify on your side.
