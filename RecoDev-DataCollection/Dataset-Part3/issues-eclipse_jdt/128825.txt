Build: 3.2 M5

While waiting for a long CVS checkout, I was browsing through some Java code.  I hit Ctrl+O to open the outline, typed some characters ("get"), and then hit Ctrl+O again to show inherited members. There was a pause, and then the outline view went blank.  After that, toggling Ctrl+O or changing the filter text in the outline had no effect - the view was just blank.  After closing the outline popup completely and reopening, it was behaving as expected.  While doing this, a large number of OperationCanceledExceptions appeared in my log file (log attached).
