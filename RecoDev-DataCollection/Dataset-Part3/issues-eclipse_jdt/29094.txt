Scenario: Enable "Show Source of Selected Element Only". Edit some Java code. 
After a while Eclipse starts to soak up CPU. It is possible to disable it 
again, and eventually Eclipse will go back to normal. If not, Eclipse will 
eventually run out of memory.

Build: 2.1-M4, Platform: WXP with a host of weird languages installed 
(mentioned because it says something about bidi in the stack dumps I get in 
the log).

Repeatable: Every time.

Excerpt from log
Unclear who is causing this. Moving to SWT since the last stack trace entries 
all belong to StyledText and there are entries without JDT involvement.
Lynne, can you investigate.  Also, there is a weird Mac problem (28711) as well 
that might be related.  I can't get it to happen on Windows but it's in the 
same area.  If they are the related, can you link them.  Thanks.
Also occurs on Win2K with bidi language installed.  
The problem is that the java editor is answering incorrect bidi segments.  I 
can get the problem to occur quite easily with the attached java file.  Open 
the file.  Click the "Show Source..." tool item.  Select the import 
declarations, WizardTest, main, createShell.  Do this a couple of times and 
evenutally repainting won't occur (due to invalid argument).  The problem seems 
to always occur with the following line:

				dialog.open();
