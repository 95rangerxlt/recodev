This aggravates me a lot. What needs to be changed? The MoveRefactoring class? 
The flow of execution runs through the RefactoringStarter class which calls 
op.run(), but I don't see where the replacement gets done. I was going to take 
a crack at putting in a fix for this, but I didn't see the spot. Does the 
participant framework need to be changed to allow for selective insertion of 
changes?
Markus, can you please have a look. The Move code is based on AST rewriting 
and we should use the insertion index proposed by ASTNodes#getInsertionIndex
Fixed in HEAD (in ReorgPolicyFactory).
