From a java perspective, create a Java project with two packages (say 
test.package1 and test.package2). Create a couple of classes in both packages. 
From the package view, select test.package2 and from the context menu, open a 
new java window on it. Notice you only see the two classes you created in this 
package. Now go back to the other window, and move a class from test.package1 
to test.package2. Go back to the new window, look at the package view and 
notice it still only displays 2 classes. Selecting refresh from the context 
menu does nothing. If you close the package view and open it again, then you 
see 3 classes.
