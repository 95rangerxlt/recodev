Build 20040622

New default syntax highlighting changes showed up in today's build. The method declarations and 
field references seem nice (they'll take some getting used to), but the "static method invocation" 
highlighting seems like it's a bit much. The psuedo-random snippets of italic, bold code is distracting 
and I don't think it's really helpful.

Highlighting fields makes sense because fields and local variables aren't distinguishable at first 
glance. But you can tell a static method invocation easily - it's a method called on a type instead of 
on an instance. Since the compiler will already warn you by default if you call a static method on an 
instance, the syntax highlighting is just redundant.

+1

I also removed the bold. It only make sense if "Method names" would be bold
which they currently aren't per default.

cc-ing EG which provided the final defaults for R3.0.
This has been fixed a while ago.
