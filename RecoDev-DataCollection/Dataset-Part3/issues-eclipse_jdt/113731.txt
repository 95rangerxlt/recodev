Hi

I am not quite sure if this is the right Component to report this bug - for an
outsider it is quite difficult to determine which Component causes a "strange"
behaviour.

Here is my bug:

Calling the refactoring on and on again causes the "Rename Package" Window to
get a little bit bigger every time.

I use IBM RAD 6.0.1 but I think this feature has nothing to do with the extra
stuff from IBM.

Cheers,
Thomas

Markus, can you please check if this is still the case in HEAD.
It's the preview page that gets bigger and bigger, not the initial Rename
Package input page, right?

[Note to self: The problem is either the integer arithmetics in
RefactoringWizardDialog2#resize(), or that the control used to save/restore the
size is not the same].

Preview Page

Yes it is the Preview Page (but it is also named "Rename Package")

Cheers,

Finally fixed in RefactoringWizardDialog2.
