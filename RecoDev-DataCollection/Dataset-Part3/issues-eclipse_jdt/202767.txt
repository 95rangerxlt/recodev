Build ID: M20070815-0800

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Place cursor on a package name
2. Press F3
3. 'Open' window appears with a list of packages in all projects appear (multiple packages are found in opened projects)
4. Select a package (double-click on name or select and click OK)
5. Nothing happens

I'd expect that this operation opens a package in Navigator and/or Package Explorer but neither of them is updated.

Open is 'Open in editor' and there's no editor registered to work with package fragments. Maybe it would be better to no try to open packages at all even it is possible that someone contributes an editor for packages.

What you request is a 'Show In' and there we would first have to ask the user where to show the element. At the moment, Show In doesn't do a code resolve, but shows the element declared at the correct offset.

Moving to jdt.text, but I guess no action is planed here.
To reveal a specific package in the package explorer use Navigate > Go To > Package...
Well, I don't know if there should or should not be an action attached to this part of a GUI but, from user's perspective, it definitely looks like something is broken. What is the point of having this 'Open' window and F3-on-package functionality if it does nothing? As you wrote -- maybe it would be better to remove this almost-feature :) if it's not going to be completed?

It looks like all the pieces are there -- user can click inside source editor and choose Show In->Navigator/Package Explorer/..., there's F3-on-package feature -- why not connect them together?

Show In-> has four options:
- Outline (doesn't make sense for packages)
- History (doesn't make sense for packages)
- Navigator
- Package Explorer

This leaves us with two possibilities - Navigator and Package Explorer.

I suggest that F3 shows package in one of them or both, depending on which view(s) is/are currently visible on screen. If none of them is shown then Package Explorer should be made visible and updated. What do you think?
There are two issues in this bug report:
1) Open / F3 which is here to open an editor and hence shouldn't do anything when a package is selected, especially not opening a selection dialog.
2) make 'Show In' work on text selection of package (fragments)

I've fixed 1) but we won't implement 2).

Fixed in HEAD.
