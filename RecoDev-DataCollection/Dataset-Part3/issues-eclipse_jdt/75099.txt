This bug report is also for Eclipse 3.0.1 (Version Selector does not know this
version :-(

Window - Preferences - Java: The preference pages "New Project" and "Organize
Imports" have been moved with Eclipse 3.0. The online help still knows them:
Java Development User Guide - Reference - Preferences - Java.
The new locations are: 
"New Project" - "Build Path"
"Organize Imports" - "Code Style - Organize Imports"

This is a little bit irritating.
