When the user selects a stack frame, we position the cursor one line below the
current line of execution. With the new "highlight current line" feature in the
Java editor, this results in two lines being highlighted - the current line and
the next line.

Because the user can turn off the Java editor option to highlight the current
line, we should still maintain our line highlighting. We just need to position
the cursor on the same line.

We are simply telling the editor to gotoMarker where the marker only specifies 
a line number.

AbstractTextEditor#gotoMarker() calls selectAndReveal with the line offset and 
line length.  The line length includes the delimiters.  This ends up 
positioning the cursor on the first character of the next line.

Re-assigning to JDT UI, as we are not specifying line offests. Fix is either in 
java editor or in abstract text editor.
the cursor is rendered by StyledText so I don't think the JavaEditor can fix 
this. Alternative is to only select the line up to the line terminator (since 
we have no current line indicator this is a problem)
The proposal discussed with Kai is to not show the line highlight when there is 
a selection.
