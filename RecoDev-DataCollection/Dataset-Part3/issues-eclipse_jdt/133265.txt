JDT HEAD as of now

It is JDT UI standard to define a public constant for command (previously action definition) and action IDs, see JdtActionConstants. The lately added ConfigureDeprecationFixAction and FindBrokenNLSKeysAction do not follow that pattern but instead define the constant inside the internal action itself:
  ConfigureDeprecationFixAction.CONFIGURE_DEPRECATION_FIX
  FindBrokenNLSKeysAction.ACTION_HANDLER_ID

This should be changed for 3.2. The API change request will most likely be granted without problems since JdtActionsCosntants is marked as "not to be subclassed".

See bug 132302 for the reasons
OK. I suggest to mark the code accordingly, so that people know why we don't follow that pattern.
