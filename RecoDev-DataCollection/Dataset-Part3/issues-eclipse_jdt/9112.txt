In the packages view
Choose Go To > Type  from the popup
The resulting dialog displays things you cannot go to
- it shows classes in referenced libraries even if you are not currenrtly 
showing referenced libraries
- it shows classes not in your working set

As a result if you pick that class nothing actually happens and you don't know 
why. 

Some options (food for thought):
- filter the dialog (classes in current view vs. all classes)
- let the user pick it then warn him its not in his current view and offer to 
change the view

for 2.0 we will show a dialog that the item is currently not visible and give 
the user the hint to change the filters/working set
