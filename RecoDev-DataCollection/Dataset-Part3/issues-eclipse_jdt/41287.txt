say I have a class and I want to override toString(), but I can't remember 
toString's return type, so I key in the following: 

class Sample {
 public toString() {
    return "Sample!";
 }
}

I get an error marker, and left click on it, and it suggests I either make 
this a constructor or add a 'void' return type. It should suggest, in this 
case, a String return type.
