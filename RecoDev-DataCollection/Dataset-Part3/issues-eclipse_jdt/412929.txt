Currently, as document described (http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Freference%2Fpreferences%2Fjava%2Fcodestyle%2Fref-preferences-organize-imports.htm), the organize import feature does only match the prefix of imports, but not the qualified class name.

If I want to make some class always be the first import in the file, like the android's "R" class, it is not possible.

I hope the organize import feature can handle the exact class and put them to the position I set.

When adding a new entry via New... button, one can already select a type, but that ends up as a package in the list. And later, its order is not honored.
Currently you can specify a qualified type name in your Organize Imports order because a type can be an import container.  I.e. if you have "com.foo.Class" in your import order, then Organize Imports should place "import com.foo.Class.Foo;" and "import com.foo.Class.Bar;" in that spot.

A question: If you have both "com.foo" and "com.foo.Class" as entries in your import order, should "import com.foo.Class;" match "com.foo" (in which it is contained) or "com.foo.Class" (which it is)?

I guess the expected organized imports, given an import order configured like this

  com.foo.Class
  java.util
  com.foo

would be

  import com.foo.Class;
  import com.foo.Class.*;
  import com.foo.Class.Foo;

  import java.util.ArrayList;

  import com.foo.OtherClass;

Note that I am currently rewriting ImportRewriteAnalyzer and I should be able to implement this change there.

The latter.
John, can I assign this bug to you?

Sure, please do.
Fixed via bug 430303.
