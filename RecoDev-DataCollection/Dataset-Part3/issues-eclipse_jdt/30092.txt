1) in the Java Browsing Perspective
2) execute Window>Show View
->notice that the Views shown in the Browsing Perspective do not show up in the 
menu. You have to go to the Other... dialog.

This should be changed (the perspective factory can define the corresponding

		layout.addShowViewShortcut(IPageLayout.ID_OUTLINE);
		layout.addShowViewShortcut(IPageLayout.ID_TASK_LIST);
		layout.addShowViewShortcut(IPageLayout.ID_RES_NAV);

This is easy to fix and will be important once we add the Show In... support
