build: M8

When exporting javadoc for jface (or org.eclipse.ui) go to 2nd wizard page 
(configure javadoc) and the list of "referenced classes" on bottom is strange, 
and does not seem to map to project references etc..it is the same for both 
projects (i.e. jface and ui).  
It is not clear to me that a user knows what to do with this list.

Also the sort order for list in question is not clear

Martin, can you please comment on this.
rewrote how the references are collect. we're now using API from jdt.launching.
Changed the description to:
Select &referenced archives and projects to which links should be generated:
anmd entries are now nicer formatted and also sorted.
