- add a multi line task in soem method
- add a bookmark at some line
- invoke "Sort members"
-> markers are lost
-> stale annotations in the overview ruler

Marking as major as this is a potential loss of work.
Martin, I guess UI can't preserve the markers since the actual code change is 
done by core. But at least it should not result in stale markers.

I guess the PR is related to bug 31135.
core has support for moving the markers. will fix.
a message dialog will show up to warn that bookmarks, tasks and breakpoint will 
be lost on moved methods.
