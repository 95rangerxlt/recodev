Build 207

When creating a compilation unit through a JavaModel operation, 2 deltas
are notified (create CU, add type), then a fine grain delta is notified.

Then, an bonus one is sent when the resource delta comes back through the
delta processor. This one is non sense and should be filtered out by the
Delta processor.

Reworked the firing of IJavaElementDeltas by batching them.
Java model operations now only create deltas (they don't automatically fire 
them). If a java model operation modifies any resources, let the delta 
processor do the merging of the deltas and the firing. If the java model 
operation doesn't modify any resources (like the SetClasspathOperation), do the 
firing right away.
