The dialog's title should use headline capitalization: "Save All Modified
Resources".

Is the second sentence "Click OK ..." really necessary? -- Right now its meaning
seems a no-brainer to me ... a la "Press "Start" to start your VCR; press "Stop"
to stop it."

If yes, it should be left aligned with the first sentence and it should have a
period at the end.

You might also reword it: "Click 'OK' to confirm or 'Cancel' to XXX".

Fixed
The "all" in the title is still in lower case.
Fixed for M2. Thanks.
