The java save action 'Add final modifier to private fields' will apply a final modifier to a member variable that is defined as transient. As final transient member fields are almost always wrong, (as after serialization the field will be null) i believe that eclipse should not be doing this save action when the field is transient.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a member that is private and transient.
2.turn on java save action "Add final modifier to private fields"
3.save the class
4.the final attribute is applied to the transient member field

Move to JDT/UI
Makes sense, fixed in VariableDeclarationFix and added CleanUpTest.

The clean up now only works on fields that have 'private' as the only (non-annotation) modifier.
