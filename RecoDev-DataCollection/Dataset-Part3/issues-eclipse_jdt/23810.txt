The new feature of TODO/Extra markers are very cool but the right underline of 
the text and the red (not filled) box in the overview ruler are just as it are 
quickfix solveable compile errors.

It would preferr if there where no underlining and that the overview ruler 
drawed let say green boxes/images for those markers.
