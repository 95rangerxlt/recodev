Please move to JDT UI if UA isn't the right owner.

Chris, what's the UA favored fix? Adding the page to the toc? Or do you want to disable the 'Show in Table of Contents' for pages not in the toc?

IMO, we could even decide to not do anything at all. The dialog that shows up is not an error dialog, it's an information dialog with the correct message.
My intent on opening this bug was for the document to be included in the toc. While the message is correct, and adequate, I would perfer that the welcome links give the user a starting place in the toc and allow them to browse easily for related information.
Yes, adding the page to the TOC is usually a good thing for a doc linked from a Welcome topic because the user can use the breadcrumbs or "show in table of contents" to find related information. You could certainly decide to do nothing at all, putting all the pages in the TOC is just a recommended practice which helps the user navigate the help documents.
