Non-Javadoc-Headers are reformatted by the new code formatter, regardless of the 
'Format header comment' option.
I think this behaviour is not desired because such headers are often used to 
store version control information.

The only current option to avoid this behaviour is to disable comment formatting 
completely (which is not a nice option).

I'll append a test java file to check the described behaviour.

Move to JDT/Text as they own comment formatting.
There are two bugs here
1) the preference only acts on Javadoc comments
2) the preference only works if the comment starts at position 0

*** Bug 49514 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
@ comment 3:

issue 1) has been fixed for M7
*** Bug 49940 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
issue 2) is not true: header comment are also not formatted if there is
whitespace before the comment start.

Closing.
oops, mistaken: 2) is still a problem, if the formatter is configured to keep
more than one blank lines.
issue 1 worked in M7, broken again in M8.
Please fix this...
Released (modified) patch by Christof.
