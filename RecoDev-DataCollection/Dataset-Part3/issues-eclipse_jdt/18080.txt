I renamed a package then launched a class in that package and got a ClassDefNotFound exception.  I 
had to go into the launch config. for the class and change the main class attribute to the new name.  
Maybe there could be an "update launch configurations" option on the rename screen.  I'm using 
build 20020521 on win2k.  Thanks.

not for 2.0
We need a more general refactoring approach to solve this (planned for 2.1 or 
3.0) since Java UI doesn't know anything about launching. This gets added by 
JDT Debug which requires JDT UI.
