I am externalizing strings but the package i have the Messages class and the 
messages.properties is not the package i currently work on.

So i always change the 2 packages to another one in the externalize window and 
then let it generate. But the import statement is not generated for the 
Messages class. So i get a compiler error for that.

I agree of course that this is a minor issue..

The missing import got fixed for I20040420.
i am using I20040422 and it still doen't generate the import statement.
It does for new files, but not for existing ones. 
What files should be new?
The class the Messages.getString("XXX") does get?
Or the messages.class or messages.properties itself?

Because if it is the class that gets externalized. then it is not working.
I just made a new Class Test.java in package a
and externalized something to package b (Messages class already existing)
but it didn't generated the import



Preparing patch.
patch works in I20040514 so this bug can be closed.
Thanks Johan.
