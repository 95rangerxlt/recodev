The protocol does not specify that the adapter can be used by anyone to access the content outline. In ContentOutline it says:

 * If the editor supports a content outline page, the editor instantiates
 * and configures the page, and returns it. This page is then added to the 

It does not say, that one can later ask for this again or that if one does so, one gets back the previous instance.

Note that the current usage of WTP's getAdapter(IContentOutline.class) also causes other troubles, see e.g. bug 365797.


The proposed patch introduces state which I do not like and it changes the semantics of getAdapter(...) for all other classes/adapters in case the Java editor is about to be disposed. That's not something I want to do.


I've now made the creation of the page more predictable.
