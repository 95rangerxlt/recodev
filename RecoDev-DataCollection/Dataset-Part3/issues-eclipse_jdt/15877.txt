Hi,

I really don't know if this is the correct category for this bug.  Sorry if I 
am at the wrong place.

The option of saving the "export to jar" wizard settings on a file is really 
good.  The only problem is that if I activate the Jar wizard again (not using 
the jardesc file) to do an export that I don't to create a jardesc for, all the 
previous settings are loaded again, including the jardesc file name.  Since 
this information is on the 2nd or 3rd page, I got it rewrite without knowing it.

Maybe the export wizard should keep the previous settings only if a jardesc is 
NOT created (afterall why do I need then persisted between wizard activations 
if I saved the information?).

no action planned for 2.0
Post 2.0 review:
Most Eclipse wizards keep the previous values (if they can't be better
initialized by the current selection). I think this is goodness.

I think what we could do is keeping the name but unchecking the option i.e. it
would not create/overwrite the .jardesc but the user could simply check it again.

>I got it rewrite without knowing it
This happened because you checked "Overwrite existing files" otherwise you would
have been asked.

Note: writing to a .jardesc is totally unrelated to the settings of the wizard
when being opened (expect of course when you open the wizard on the .jardesc
itself).

Fixed as described.
