I have a scenario where multiple document edits are desired as part of a quick fix implementation: 

1. Invoking AddGetterSetterAction.run() to offer the creation of Getter/Setter methods
2. If the above is not canceled, change the access modifier for a public field to private.

Unfortunately, the AddGetterSetterAction has no private field which tracks the dialog result (e.g. Window.OK) ... 

As a work-around, the user can use edit-undo to back off the access modifier change after a cancel operation...

We do not offer similar methods in other actions. Actions are not designed to be explicitely invoked by their run() methods.

Please feel free to file an enhancement request to provider API for getter/setter generation.
Let me correct this, programmatically invoking 'run' is ok to do. We should use Action.notifyResult to communicate the result.
This would e.g. allow our actions to be usable in cheetsheets.
I think it would be good to have this at least for the code manipulation actions. Tobias can you have a look?
I'll make a pass over the code manipulation actions
