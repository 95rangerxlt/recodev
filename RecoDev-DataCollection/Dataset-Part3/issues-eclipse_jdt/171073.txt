When a selected compilation unit only has one field, or one method, choosing Source > Sort Members... results in the following dialog:

Title: Sort Members
Icon: Information
Prompt: There are not enough members in this type to sort.

Please remove this dialog, since it does not add anything that the user cares to know about.  The fact that there is only one member means that the compilation unit is already sorted.  A dialog is not displayed when the members of a compilation are already sorted, and therefore one should not be displayed when there is only one member.

This dialog reduces the usability of Eclipse and annoys the user.

How true, this apparently slipped through when bug 113338 was marked as fixed...
Fixed in HEAD.
