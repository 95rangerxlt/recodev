hi,

 at the moment "Correct Indentation" is an action that applies to an editor. It would be great if the same action were available as an action on resources selected in the package explorer. i.e. you would be able to select a project, or a source folder, or a discontiguous selection of sources and correct their indentation as a single action. 

At the moment you would have to open each file individually, invoke the action and save it.

thanks,
Andrew

Use format for this.
hi Daniel,

 I see your point, but was already aware of the format option, and believe there is value in having "Correct Indentation" treated separately?

If for a single file, you have a choice between CI and full-blown-format, then it would make sense to me that this same choice be available for a selection of multiple files? This isn't purely about symmetry in the UI however - reindenting a source tree is likely to be non-controversial, but reformatting a source tree can easily raise religious arguments about the Correct formatting style. I never reformat source files on team projects for this reason since other developers (perhaps not using eclipse) could object. 

Its probably not an urgent work item, but in terms of UI consistency I currently think its the right thing to do long term?

(I've reopened the bug just in case messages aren't sent when its marked resolved, rather than pre-empting any decision :)

thanks,
Andrew

Well, indenting is already part of formatting and very religious, e.g. some people use tabs, some spaces and others use the mixed version and in fact we grab the preferences from the formatter to do the indenting.

Martin, what's your take on this?
I think the request makes sense. Indenting is less intrusive than formatting.
As we already have the action, it's a value add to also offer it on multiple files.

There is a correct indentation clean up. Clean up can be executed on any set of java elements. Adding a correct indentation action to java elements would now be trivial (by extending CleanUpAction) but I don't think it is necessary. What you think?

having this available in the clean-up wizard is great news :)

if I get a vote then +1 for the additional correct indentation action, on the basis of convenience and ui consistency. It would be nice to be able to select some projects and hit ctrl-I, analogously to how organize imports can be used.
