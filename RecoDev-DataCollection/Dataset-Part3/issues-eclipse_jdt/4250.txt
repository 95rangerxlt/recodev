- create a workspace with a package that contains a CU
	- select the CU and start DND.
	- hover over the container package
	- press ctrl key to change operation to copy
	==> still not able to copy file

	Note: this was possible with old reorg support.

NOTES:

	we don't support copy when the file already exists.
	this is the first complaint that we no longer allow it.
	How about creating the duplicate elements as
	"CopyOfOriginalElement.java".

	is the following semantic acceptable? (it'll be consistent with the navigator) 
	_copy only_ 

	# if the file (let's asume it has nama A.ext) already exists, then create a file named CopyOfA.ext 
	note this can create names	 like CopyOf(CopyOf)*A.ext
	but i don't think it's a problem, really
	# for files, packages, folders - it's all the same semantics
	
	# for java files nothing else than creating a new one with the new name is done 
	(no declaration, reference etc. update)
	# for packages - only the package declaration in files is updated i.e. changed to CopyOfold.package.name
	# for other entities - only the straightforward 'copy with rename' operation
	# no interaction with user - just creates the entities

	What exactly does "for other entities - only the straightforward 'copy with rename' operation" mean ? Does the copy
	action prompt me for a new name when coping other element (e.g. image.gif) and only for CU we use the CopyOf semantic?

	I know the the Window Explorer is using the CopyOf approach but I must say that I really prefer the Copy-Rename appraoch.

	I can live with both approaches as long as the UI is consistent.

	it'd be CopyOf... everywhere
