The current test run listener support is limited for scenarios when you want to find out the name of the test suite a user has executed.

As a work around you can track the launch listener and inspect the launch config, but this should be simpler.

Also the current test run listener is too limited in the face of the new support for concurrent test runs.

*** Bug 147262 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
new API added for M4:
   TestRunListener: reports started/finished test run sessions and test case runs
   ITestElement: hierarchy of test elements as shown in the UI, also to be used for actions in the JUnit view.

Listener can be registered on JUnitCore.addTestRunListener (no extension point anymore, but speak up if you think this is needed)

Would be good if you could have a look at the new API and let us know if you need more.
