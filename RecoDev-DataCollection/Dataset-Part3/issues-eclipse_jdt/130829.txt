empty box
Strange. We changed the hover to use the Browser widget when it is available... I cannot reproduce here, though.

Can you check the following things:
- does the hover not work for any imports, or just some? What about if you have the imports in source?
- does the javadoc view show the expected content when putting the caret inside the import statement?
- what happens when you press F2 when the yellow box is showing - do you get contents then?
- do you have attached javadoc or attached source (which one) for core.runtime?
I think I may have found a pattern.

Let's say the import is:
import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IStatus

If I hover over the word IStatus, I get a yellow page with useful info.
If I hover over 'eclipse', 'core', 'runtime', I get the empty yellow box.

The screenshot was taken on PluginImportOperation.java (from pde.ui), where core.runtime is in the target (ie. not in the workspace) and has javadoc attached courtesy the pde container.
Ok, reproduced.

I see:
- hovering over the type's simple name works as expected.
- hovering over the qualifier shows the empty hover for some package fragments.
- the same works for other packages

I have for example the following import:

import org.eclipse.ui.views.contentoutline.IContentOutlinePage;

> hovering over any segment of 'org.eclipse.ui.views' gives me the empty hover
> hovering over 'contentoutline' doesn't show anything

Investigating.
