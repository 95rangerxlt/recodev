@Dani: Any change that you bring these words in for Eclipse 4.2 / 3.8? I see no target milestone.

Obviously things like "png" don't qualify, so I have to check each entry in this bug and currently I'm busy with much more important things.
If it is important for you, then please check each entry against:

For British English: http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british
For American English: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary

and provide a list of valid words or even better, a patch.

These don't have a general dictionary definition, but they are defined within the broad field of computer sciences:
viewport = refers to one specific piece in a system related to 3D computer graphics.
uncomment = performing a specific programming language source code change in a text editor.
classpath = the name of a Java-specific programming environment feature.

These are alternate versions:
colorspace = color space
lifecycle = life cycle
@Time, Dani defined the criteria for inclusion in Comment 20 and AFAIK this is not open for discussion. I personally also agree with the approach of using official dictionaries. This helps to avoid lengthy discussions about if a word should be included or not. 

@Matthias, I suggest you check the words we collected so gar against the online dictionaries and report "invalid" words in this bug after updating the review.
Lars, what I listed was the definition found by checking each word ('entry') against merriam-webster.com and macmillandictionary.com dictionaries, respectively. M-W was behind a paywall for most of the time; those were marked N/A. If 'valid word' is taken to mean a word that someone who understands English but isn't familiar with that word can find a definition for using one of the dictionaries, then the 1st list in comment 35 is a list of such words and their definitions. 

However, that would still leave the spell checker marking the word "classpath" - used in several places within the Eclipse IDE itself - as spelled wrong. Maybe a new bug should be opened for that one?
Timo, I re-checked "committer" in both directories and they returned that this word is unknown. What did you do different?
I did what someone who is using a dictionary to check the meaning of a word would do if the dictionary didn't have that particular variation of it: I didn't give up but looked at the similar words that were suggested.

I'll retrace my steps:

Merriam-Websters: the word committee is suggested in a dropdown list when you type in the word committer. The first definition for the word committee is "archaic : a person to whom a charge or trust is committed". Employee is to employer as committee is to committer, ergo committer is a person from whom a charge or trust is committed.

Macmillan: the word committed is the first suggestion in the "Did you mean" list when you search for committer. The definition page for committed contains a "related dictionary definitions" section with a link to "commit, verb". One of the definitions of commit is "to give someone or something to someone else to look after". A writer is someone who writes, ergo a committer is someone who gives someone or something to someone else to look after.

It's remarkable how close to the correct definition both of those are despite coming from different dictionaries that are in no way geared towards IT terminology. I guess it empirically proves that this manner of checking a word is proper and valid.

@Dani, is this in line with your acceptance criteria?

If the argumentation would be correct, then the word would be in the dictionary ;-). I want to keep a clear rules.
I don't know what criteria the maintainers of dictionaries use to decide which word forms to add and when, but I know me having to workaround few missing derivative words is not the deciding factor. Oxford English Dictionary at oxforddictionaries.com recognizes the word *committer* as a noun derivative from the verb commit so it seems there are no generalizations to be drawn here. The difference could be just in a conscious decision to make your dictionary that much more easy to use and then doing it.

Of the word *versioning*, Oxford's American-English definition says: "

version 
verb  [with object] (often as noun versioning)
create a new version of:

itâ€™s the software for you if you need versioning and group editing"

Now that's how one exceeds expectations and goes to set the example for others to strive for.
Getting back to https://git.eclipse.org/r/15830 I simply check the words I added against those well known dictionary publisher instead of http://dict.leo.org/ (a project run by the Technical University of Munich, Computer Science Department that is very popular in Germany) to get merged?
@Matthias, yes. I suggest you create a little spreadsheet (maybe an Google doc which can be later exported as .cvs file and attached to this bug) which contain your checks. 

As format I suggest:

Word         Macmillandictionary   Merriam-webster  comment
screenshot   Yes                   Yes
screenshots  Yes                   Yes
Evangelist   Yes                   Yes
handsets     No                    No
handset      Yes                   Yes              added because handsets failed

etc.

After we have the data, you can update your Gerrit review patch.

And once we have done this work, Dani could apply the patch (if he trusts us) or check the words again (if we does not) ;-)
Here we go https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApPX-BsqgwegdEtSX1JLc0lDQ1B2Q1I2Y2hfbHFmZnc&output=html I used only dictionaries by reliable well-known publishers except Merriam Webster because for the 14 days trial triggered after several searches they want your credit card number.
@Matthias, could you add the links for Apache? It looks to me that it is contained in the official dictionaries?

@Dani, are you ok with a Gerrit review for the green entries in the spreadsheet?

I've never seen this in years.

Yes, if they follow the rules ;-).
> I've never seen this in years. 

Maybe you never checked a lot of words in the same session. 

> Yes, if they follow the rules ;-).

The rules seems to require a credit card, which I hope invalidates that rule. 	Are you ok with http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/ as new checker?

Possibly, but for earlier requests I used in several times in a row without problems. Maybe they changed it in the meantime.

Sounds wrong, given we use Merriam Webster for AMERICAN English. I don't have time to evaluate a new dictionary at this point. If you are confident with the words, you can prepare a patch and I will sanity check some of the entries. If they pass, I'll accept the change.

oxforddictionaries.com has also English:

@Matthias, sounds good. Please create a Gerrit review for Dani.

Thanks. The change is almost good. See my comments there.
I updated https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/17076/ Sorry for the change commit spam. I am just getting used to EGit and Gerrit.

This bug here is closed, so adding new words here won't help.
Dani, is this the only ticket that's ever going to add dictionary words for 4.4? My opinion is to keep this ticket open until RC1 so other words can be added.

We can collect more words in a new bug. Once a patch is ready and released, I want the bug to be closed. That's easier to track.
