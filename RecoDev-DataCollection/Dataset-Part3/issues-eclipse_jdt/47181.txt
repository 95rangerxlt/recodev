Why does the Refactor > Generalize Type ... menu option always appear on non-
java files and when choosing it nothing happens.

For example I have a file named 'ccccccc' in a java project and it can 
apparantly be refactored in this way.

The action is always enabled after it gets enabled once. Problem is that the 
else case in selectioChanged is missing setting enablement=false;

Frank, the action should only be enabled if the selected element is

- a field
- a method and the method has a return type.
I fixed it and released it to HEAD.
