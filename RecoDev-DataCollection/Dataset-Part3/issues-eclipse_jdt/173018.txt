1. open the GetterSetters dialog on a final field
2. check the 'Allow setters for..."
==> parent is white-checked but there are unchecked children

Side Note: when a user checks that option you can probably assume that he wants to generate the setters and hence you could simply check them for the user.

Other Test Case:
1. open the GetterSetters dialog on a final field
2. check the 'Allow setters for..."
3. generate some setters
4. open the GetterSetters dialog on another final field
5. observe: setters there - everything checked
6. uncheck the 'Allow setters for..."
7. check the 'Allow setters for..."
==> state from step 5 lost: setter(s) will no longer be generated

Created attachment 58326
Picture showing invalid checked state
Fixed the parent-gray/white behavior and remember checked finals.
Decided to keep the initial state for now: always restore the persisted state..
