Pull Up fails while creating method stub in subclass due to bug in
ASTNodeFactory#newDefaultExpression. I'll add a fix.

Steps: pull up "getCount", declare abstract in destination, create stubs checked

- file A.java:
public class A extends Root {
	private int fCount;

	public int getCount() {
		return fCount;
	}
}

- file B.java:
public class B extends Root { }

- file Root.java:
public class Root { }

Fix

Problem was that the new ASTNode was created on the AST of the original return
type instead of the given target AST.
Patch released. Fixed in I-build > 20030901
