If you go to preferences->java->editor->templates you can create a template 
for editing java code. In addition there are several defined variables such as 
${enclosing_type} which use code to determine the value of the variable. It 
would be great if we could extend these programmed variables to accomplish 
other actions by creating plugins that extend these variables. 

For example, I could create a plugin that implments 
${selected_word_capitalized} to create a template that would capitalize the 
selected word in the editor. In this manner the template mechanism could be 
easily extended by plugin developers.

In fact you are asking for more here: what you describe is not just specifying a
variable but a script.
