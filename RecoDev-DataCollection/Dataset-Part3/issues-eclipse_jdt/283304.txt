Please add access for getLaunchedProject() of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.model.TestRunSession in org.eclipse.jdt.junit.model.ITestRunSession.
My problem is that i need the launched project to reproduce and analyse the testCases (ITestCaseElement). The only "data" i get is the testClassName and testMethodName but that is not unique in the workspace. If you make getLaunchedProject() public over ITestRunSession, i will find the correct testCase everytime correct.

Workaround is so cast the org.eclipse.jdt.junit.model.ITestRunSession object into org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.model.TestRunSession and invoke getLaunchedProject(). But this is the bad way cause TestRunSession is internal.
