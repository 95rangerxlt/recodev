When using unqualified access to an inherited field, the Quickfix 
suggests "<Classname>.this.<fieldname>".
Instead it should be "this.<fieldname>" or maybe "super.<fieldname>".

Do you have a code example where this happens?
Example:
public class Test extends java.util.Properties {
	public Test() {
		defaults = null;		
	}
}

When compiler option "Unqualified access to instance field" is set to warning, 
quick fix on variable "defaults" yields: "Qualify with "Properties.this". 
After accepting the quick fix, you have:
		Properties.this.defaults = null;
