The JDT/UI tests (especially JavaProjectHelper) are using IJavaProject.getPackageFragmentRoot(String) without following its spec. This method creates a handle to an external library. However the tests are passing a workspace relative path.

The attached patch fixes one occurrence of this mis-usage.
