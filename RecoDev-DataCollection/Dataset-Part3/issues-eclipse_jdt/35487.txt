Build: 2.1 RC3a

The refactor > change method signature refactoring opens a dialog where
parameter ordering is specified, etc.

On Linux Motif, the message at the bottom is clipped to be only a couple of
pixels high.  It is impossible to read.  From Windows, I can see this message
says, "Specify the new order of parameters and/or their new names".

Have to investigate under Linux what is going on. 
Message isn't clipped under Linux-GTK and Windows. However fix is easy and we 
should put it in for RC4 since all refactoring dialogs are affected under Linux-Motif. 
 
Problem is that height under Motif of a test containing the text ("\n\n") isn't computed 
correctly. It is when using " \n ";

Patch that fixes the problem
Risk of fix is low
If we don't fix this for 2.1 error messages in the refactoring wizard aren't 
readable under Motif.

Tested it under MacOS as well and Mac shows the same error as Motif (the error 
message isn't readable at all). The proposed fix fixes the problem under Mac 
as well.
