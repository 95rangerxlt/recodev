Build Identifier: M20100211-1343

Inlining a subtracted expression produces the wrong result because the refactoring tool fails to parenthesize the arguments.

Example: instead of x - (y + z), you can end up with x - y + z.

(See attached test case).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the test case as-is.
2. Inline each of the functions in main().
3. Run the test case again and observe the difference.

This is a test case to demonstrate the bug (requires manual steps; see file).
Issues with Eclipse's Java tooling goes to JDT.

fix + tests

It is better to add extra parenthesis in some cases e.g. x + (y + z) , than change the semantics on inlining.
Fixed in HEAD.
