Version 3.0.m7.

I just had a case where Organize Imports does not remove unused import. 

I do not know if this always happens in this build or if this a special case. We
have such a large pile with so many dependencies that I did not take the time to
chase this down, sorry.

I suspect it was a reference in a Javadoc. There was a bug in jdt.core that such
references were marked as unused even they were used in Javadoc comments.

This has been fixed by jdt core in I20040310. Please ropen if it is not the case.
Oops, my bad then.
