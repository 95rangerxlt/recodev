I keep right clicking at the root of the package explorer and expect to be able 
to close the project. Also if the package explorer is empty (i.e. no java 
projects open) I keep expecting the context menu there to contain the open 
project option. Would it be ok to have those two there?

Yes and no. The reason why the Close project item is not part of the context 
menu is to keep the context menu at a reasonable size (UI guidelines talk about 
~20 entries). So we moved less common actions into the global menu bar. 

Are you aware of the Open/Close project actions in the Project menu. The work 
as expected if the package explorer has focus.
Of course I am aware of the project menu. As far as I am aware there is no 
other way to open/close a project. I do feel that the open/close project 
actions are common. Perhaps this request could be fixed by making the context 
menus customizable. However that would involve a lot more change! 
Wouldn't it be ok if the open/close project options are only shown if you click 
on the root of a project. This would be more acceptable because the UI 
guidelines would only be broken in this rare case.
Mihgt be improved by rendering non Java projects in the packages explorer, 
which is on the M5 plan.
Got fix for I20030128. Both actions are now in the context menu of projects.
