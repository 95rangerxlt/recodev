patch for org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv that adds png images and fixes the
html to use these images

After you apply the patch you'll have to remove the gif images manually.
Something like this in the org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv directory:

find -name \*.gif -exec rm -f {} \;

should do the trick on a unix or linux machine.
A patch for org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user can be found here (it was too big to
put in bugzilla):

http://people.redhat.com/bkonrath/eclipse/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user-images-converted-to-png.patch

You will have to remove the .gif files in the same manner discribed above.

org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv: patche without png images

Let me know if you have any problems with this patch - I had some issues mixing

the plugins checked out with eclipse and the command line "patch".

org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv: tar.gz with png images

The directory structure is intact so you should be able to uncompress this over

top of the plugin folder. Again, let me know if you have any problems.

Ben, 

I can untar the file attached under comment #4. Trying to do so produces

tar -vxzf org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv.tar.gz

Can you please check the file and may be reattach it.
Ben, the same happens with the zip file attached under comment #6. 

May be we should use zip instead of tar.gz.
Hi Dirk,

Hmmm, that's strange. I downloaded both of the tarball attachments and I can
untar org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv.tar.gz without problems but
org.eclipse.doc.user.tar.gz gave me some trouble. 

When I attached the tarballs, I also transfered them to my people page:

http://people.redhat.com/bkonrath/eclipse/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv.tar.gz
http://people.redhat.com/bkonrath/eclipse/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user.tar.gz

I just downloaded them from the webpage and they both seem to work. Could you
try using the tarballs listed above? If these don't work for you, I will attach
zips. 
Downloading the patches using the provided locations worked.

Fixed for M5
I just found image tag that I missed. Patch to follow.
