JDT contributes icons which show up in the menu bar of the Debug Perspective
even if the Java Perspective has never been opened. As the number of vendors
contributing to Eclipse increases, the Debug Perspective will become extremely
cluttered if they all contribute half a dozen icons.

Does JDT need to contribute all of the icons that are currently in the Debug
Perspective? Why are the creation icons (Java Project, Class, Interface, etc.)
in the Debug Perspective anyway?

agreed, that the Java creation actions don't need to be in the debug 
perspective. However they are in the same action set as Open Type. We have to 
split the Java Action set and no long extend the debug perspective with 
creation action set.
Splitted action set into Java action set and Java Element Creation action set.
