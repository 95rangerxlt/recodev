This request involves being able to filter what files are placed in the build 
directory during the build process.  Our site currently uses SourceSafe and all 
of the *.scc files created by SourceSafe are copied to the build directory 
during the process.  A filter would allows users to prevent files such as these 
from being copied during the build process.

Where would you expect to specify this filter ? On a per project basis, or on a 
per source folder basis ?
I think on a per project basis would be sufficient.  I think it might be nice 
to set a preference for all projects and allow it to be overridden on a project 
basis.

Thanks!

Time permitting.
Understood.  Thanks for the consideration...
This problem got escaladated, and will be addressed soon.
The project resource copy behavior will be controlled by some filters (UI 
configurable). A JavaCore setting is being added to hold the active filters.

By default it will exclude cvs subfolders and .* files.
Kent, do we want to distinguish folders from files in the filter pattern ?
We could specify "cvs/,.*" so as to indicate the first one is to be filtered 
only if being a folder.

Personally, I don't know if it is worth making the difference.
Will only consider filtering files.
Fixed.

Even i have the same problem with Callisto release, I am using SVN and the .svn folder is copied to the build path, is it possible to allow the filter at the project level or is there any option to specify folders and files to be excluded?
