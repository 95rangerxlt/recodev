convention is to not start a dialog with an error condition (the user hasn't 
done anything, so it isn't fair to blame him)
fixed: error does not show when wizard is first displayed.

But I wonder if the current behaviour is confusing to the user:
Example:
*I select a class A in the package view.
*Choose JUnit TestCase Wizard.
*The wizard puts the class A in the "Test Class" field and the class ATest 
in "TestCase". If a class ATest already exists, the Next and Finish buttons are 
disabled.

The user must realize that only by changing the TestCase will he be able to go 
on with the wizard (or modifying any field will show up the error message).
