Create J project J with class folder X that has JUnit class files
Create J project B with X on build path
Create a new class in B:
public class JTest {
 junit.framework.
}
I started code assist and it worked up to packages but failed on the types.

Should be an issue in the namelookup/searchable environment.
Code assist call SearchEngine to find type.
JavaSearchScope use the index file of the project instead of the index file of 
the class folder.

Fixed
