Build 20021018

If you open a cu outside the classpath in a Java editor, attempting to refactor 
from the Outline brings up a dialog saying: 'The resource is not on the build 
path of a Java project'. This is good.

However the following actions are allowed and they don't make sense for this 
kind of cu:
- Open Type Hierarchy
- Override/Implements methods
- Add constructor from Superclass
- References
- Declarations

These actions should bring up the same dialog as for refactoring.

Fixed the Open Type Hierarchy Action. There is a helper class ActionUtil that 
can be used to do the checks.

Martin, can you please fix Override/Implements method and add constructor from 
suoerclass.

Daniel, can you please fix the search actions. 
Done for search.
