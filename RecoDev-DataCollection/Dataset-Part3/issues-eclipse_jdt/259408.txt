Quick views should stay in compare editor if same CU.
Tomasz, I could not find API to select/reveal an element or range in a concrete pane of the Compare editor. Is that finding correct?
Yes, you're right, for the needs of revealing and selecting a range in a merge source viewer I used org.eclipse.compare.internal.MergeSourceViewer.TextEditorAdapter, but I'm afraid this won't work for you. Furthermore, I would like to get rid of the adapter as soon as we implement our own text compare similar to the java one. So I wouldn't recommend using the adapter in the shape it's now.
By implementing our own text compare I meant addressing bug 259410.

getActiveEditorInput

A quick patch that adds a new API returning an active editor input. Is this helpful?

Patch v02

Asking Compare Editor for an adapter for IEditorInput.class will return an active editor input, an input for an active source viewer in TMV. I guess it's more what you need Dani.
The patch works fine. I can fix this bug once you've committed it.
The patch for Compare part has been released to HEAD, thanks for checking it Dani.
Thanks Tomasz.

Fixed in HEAD.
