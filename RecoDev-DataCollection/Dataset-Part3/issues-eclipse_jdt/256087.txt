Build I20081118-1720.

I have the following simple line of code:

if (condition) return false;

I want to insert brace around the single statement of the if  block.
For this, I only type a brace just before the return and simply hit 'Enter':

if (condition) {return false;

As my Java editor preference 'Automatically close {braces}' is checked,
I would expect to get the following code:

if (condition) {
    return false;
}

But I get the following code instead:

if (condition) {
    
}return false;


As this code does not compile, it's a little bit annoying...

Note that it worked until 3.5M2 but was broken in 3.5M3...
This got broken during 3.5 M3.
Fixed in HEAD.
