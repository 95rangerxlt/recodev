Build 20020502

Selecting a problem in the bird's eye view should have the same effect as 
selecting the problem by hitting ctrl+e.

The only difference right now is that the bird's eye view doesn't display the 
message from the problem in the status bar. This means that to get the problem 
message, users have to first click on the problem in the bird's eye view, then 
click in the editor before the problem, then hit ctrl+e to get the error 
message to appear.

notice that, you can also get the error message by hovering over the squigly 
lines.

Reopening for 2.1 consideration
