The problem is that the multi text edit passed to generate the preview isn't 
defined yet. As a consequence its range is [0, MAX_INT] which is clearly 
outside of the document bounds. 

Fix is to distinguish between defined regions and raw regions. Has to be done 
in TextEdit. Must also check what the methods getLength and get*End are 
supposed to return. IMO they must return defined regions as well.
