The SerialVersionID quickfix significantly delays the appearance of the 
quickfix proposals (on the order of 3s in my set-up). The computation of the 
serialversion ID should be done in a more lazy fashion so that the delay only 
happens when the user actually applies this quickfix.

The quick fix is already computed lazily. If we postpone it until the user 
applies it we have to have a story for the preview. 

We should discuss this with Martin because this will change the way how the 
quick fix works.
I don't think the preview of the exact value is really important. The preview
could be something like 
...
private static final long serialVersionUID= <compiler-generated SUID>;
...

The calculation of the value can then be shown in a (cancellable) progress dialog.
Changed preview to a generic message
