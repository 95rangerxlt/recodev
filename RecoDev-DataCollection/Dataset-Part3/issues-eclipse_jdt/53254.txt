What I wanted: 
I wanted to add a new source folder called "foo" to the build path. The source folder  
did not already exist. 
  
What I did: 
I went into the project properties --> Java Build Path --> "Add Folder...". Since the  
source folder did not already exist, I selected "Create New Folder..." and created it.  
After creating the folder, it appeared in the "Source Folder Selection" window as  
selected but the OK button was still grayed out. I had to deselect and select the folder  
in order to "ungray" the OK button.  
  
What I expected: 
The OK button should not have been grayed out.
