3.1-RC3 test pass

- have the cu below
- code assist after Col
- select 'Collection' using the arrow keys (don't insert the proposal yet)
- insert the proposal by pressing '.'

expected: selection after the '.'

actual: the closing '>' is selected

This happens because the generic java type proposal selects the first ambiguous
type argument when inserted. We should either:

- not let '.' be a trigger character for parameterized type proposals, or
- not set the selection if the proposals is entered by a trigger character (as
opposed to 'return' or mouse click.
