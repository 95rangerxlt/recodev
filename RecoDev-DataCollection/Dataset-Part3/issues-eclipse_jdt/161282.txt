Create a blank file with a main method, and type in the method:

Set[CTRL-SPACE and import Set]<String> my = new [CTRL-SPACE and choose TreeSet, and finish the line]

You should have ended up with:

Set<String> my = new TreeSet<String>();

Where TreeSet was "auto-added" by Eclipse, but it will be underlined red, for you still need to import it.

Expected: if Eclipse added TreeSet, it should have added an import line for it.
