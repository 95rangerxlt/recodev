Fix for copy to clipboard

Patch against JDT UI.

This patch adds an action to the context menu which copies the currently shown
call hierarchy (as text, in full, regardless of max call depth). Filters are
used.

Open questions:
- Should the max call depth filter be ignored?
- Should the output format be text or some fancy graphic?
i tried you patch and have the following commnets:

copying full hierarchy is not intuitive
it should copy only what's visible in the view (or what's 'below' the selected 
node)

1. using the suggested strategy will solve this dillema as well
2. pure text is best
> it should copy only what's visible in the view (or what's 'below' the selected 
> node)
OK, I guess that makes more sense

Copy to Clipboard, second attempt

Patch for JDT UI.

Changed to copy what's shown in the call hierarchy tree (from the selected node
and below). Only expanded nodes are copied.
cool
