The JAVA editor should show the line and col numbers on the status bar of the 
current cursor position, also if possible there should be an option to show the 
line numbers next to the code in the editor.

Support for more line information is under consideration
Line and colum information is now visible in the status bar. There is no support 
for line numbers in the vertical ruler yet. Build > 20011124.
Build 20011206

Column numbers display correctly when viewing complete source. When viewing 
source of "selected element only", however, the column number does not show up 
correctly. It should read 69, but is reading -44277.
Above comment is redundant. This problem has been captured in Bug 6404.
Bug 6404 has been fixed. Build > 20011210.
Behavior has been implemented. PR set to fixed. Line numbers in vertical ruler 
is another feature request. Committed for 2.0.
