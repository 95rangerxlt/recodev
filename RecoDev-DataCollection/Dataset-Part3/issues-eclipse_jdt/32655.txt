In Java Editor ,
 when I input switch() statement, it is formated as follows

  switch( flag ){
      case 0:
      some = code();
      break;
      case 1:
  .........

But I use Source>Format function , it is formated as follows
  switch( flag ){
      case 0:
          some = code();
          break;
      case 1:
............

And when I paste a sentence into switch() section, it is auto indented as follows,

  switch( flag ){
      case 0:
      case 1:
  .........
     |
     v
  switch( flag ){
      case 0:
      some = code();
      break;
      case 1:
  .........

I think it is a setting bug of auto indenter.
