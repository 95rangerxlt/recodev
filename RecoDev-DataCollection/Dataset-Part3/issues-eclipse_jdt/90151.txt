The default context should be "Java" and not "Javadoc".

In other words ... clicking on "New..." ... "Java" will be selected in the
context combo.

It's far more common to enter Java templates than Javadoc templates.

Did some investigation.

ContextTypeRegistry uses a HashMap; the hash of "javadoc" is smaller than "java"'s.

Therefore TemplatePreferencePage#add will use "javadoc" because it uses the
first template it finds.

@@@@

Possible fixes:

1) add a "default" attribute to the contextType extension and filter in #add

2) add a "protected String getDefaultContext()" hook method to
TemplatePreferencePage returning null and override in JavaTemplatePreferencePage
to return "java"; filter on the returned value if not null

3) change to LinkedHashMap and depend on the order the context's are declared

@@@@

1 & 2 might be to late for 3.1

3 might be an interim fix.
This has been fixed a long time ago.
Verified; ContextTypeRegistry uses LinkedHashMap; changed in 1.12
