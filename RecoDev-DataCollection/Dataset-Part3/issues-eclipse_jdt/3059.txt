The PDE wizard should append the value of JRE_LIB to the <property name="compilePath value="..."> in the build.xml file
	for the default JVM.

	It is not there, and as a result plugins do not compile when running Eclipse on J9.
	After I edit the build.xml to add the missing entry for JRE_LIB I can successfully execute the "Create Jar".

NOTES:
	
	As of build 122, there is no way for PDE to pass JRE_LIB to the build.xml creation class. 

	I am moving this PR to Core for future reference (it is obviously too late for it now).

PRODUCT VERSION:

	Eclipse 0.119


Fixed if using the compiler adapter provided by JDT Core. If the user does not
specify a bootclasspath the value of the variable JRE_LIB is used. Tested with
J9 on Linux build 20020501 and worked fine. In order to use the JDT compiler
adapter use:

<property name="build.compiler"
value="org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JDTCompilerAdapter"/>

Moving to JDT Core for closure.

Fixed.
