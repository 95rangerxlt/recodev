Call Hierarchy should display the current search scope in the view title, like
the Search View does. E.g.:

Members calling 'updateView()' - in Workspace
Calls from 'updateView()' - in Working Set: my projects

Michael, thanks for your contribution. Fix realeased to HEAD.

Jesper, I don't really know what the call hierarchy should do when the user
switches scopes. Today, old tree items are retained, even though they may not be
accurate under the new scope. Only tree new expansions are affected by the new
scope. The view title is only changed when a new root is set.

Since re-calculating the whole hierarchy is prohibitively expensive, that's not
an option. And I also don't like to just remove the items. Therefore, I think
*not* updating the title is the best we can do: the user sees that the label
doesn't update (it's still correct for the hierarchy calculated before
switching) and can always refresh if she wants.
My only comment would be to change SearchScopeHierarchyAction to use 
getFullyQualifiedName() [didn't know it existed until after I submitted the 
patch].

I am wondering the the Project name would also be useful.

BTW, how do you remove all the hierarchies?  It seems you always have one.
Also wasn't sure if you want to share the properties between the Search and 
CallHierarchy or to migrate those properties over.
