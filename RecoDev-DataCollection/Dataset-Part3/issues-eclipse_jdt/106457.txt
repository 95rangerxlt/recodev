R3.1

The selected working set not shown when hovering over Package Explorer title.
However, if you go into a folder it is shown. If you then go up to the workspace
again it is still shown. Now unselect the working set and guess what: it is
still indicated in the tooltip.

Fixed for RC1.
This is not fixed (verified using N20060412-0010): it seems to store the name whenever one switches to working set mode and then back to project mode: the name then remains sticky i.e. the wrong working name is shown even after switching to some other working set (in project mode).
Dani, speaking with your voice: open a new bug since this is a different problem although introduced by this fix ;-)
Well, the "fix" does not even fix the initial problem so why leave it FIXED?
Fixed for RC2.
