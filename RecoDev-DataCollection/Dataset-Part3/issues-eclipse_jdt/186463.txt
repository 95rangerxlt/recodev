The support for Java 6 annotation processing in Eclipse 3.3 is more limited than the support for Java 5.  For instance, Java 5 processors can run at reconcile, but Java 6 processors can't; files generated by Java 5 processors are automatically cleaned up when they are no longer generated, but files generated by Java 6 processors stick around until a clean; and Java 6 processing in the IDE is much less tolerant of incomplete (not-compileable) code than Java 5 processing is.

We need to publicize these limitations, either in the release notes, on the APT web page, in the online help, or some combination of the above.

I've updated the help already, but should make changes to the APT web site and possibly the release notes.
Release notes updated (see bug 185753).
Fixed for RC2.  The web site still needs refreshing, but that's an ongoing effort not associated with a particular release, so I'm going to close this bug.
