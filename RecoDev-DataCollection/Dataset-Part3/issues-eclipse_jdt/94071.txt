We are moving from book.css for each document plug-in to one shared css for 
the entire Eclipse. It is placed in org.eclipse.platform and all existing 
book.css files should just point at it.

Action item:

Remove the entire content of book.css in org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv and 
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user and insert the following line:

@import "../PRODUCT_PLUGIN/book.css";

Platform and PDE docs are already modified this way.

Great - thanks!
