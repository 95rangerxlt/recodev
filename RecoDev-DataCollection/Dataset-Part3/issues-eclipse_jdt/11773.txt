Seconded, except I would rather filter.  


Please be more specific.
Sorter for...
Filter for...
sorter for names (what else is there?) - just like in the outliner
ok, filtering is not there in java perspective either - so you can treat as 
invalid
Sorters only makes sense for Members view.
==> renamed this bug report
Filter support is planned for M6.
==> added new bug report 12266
