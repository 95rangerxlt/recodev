On the preview page of Pull Up refactoring is a "Select Pulled Up" button.
I assume what it actually does is "Restore Defaults".
the wording is confusing
but it's not 'restore defaults'
it means: 'select those methods that will be pulled up'
Why not restore defaults? Doesn't it restore to the initial (i.e. default)
selection when the dialog opened? If not, please outline the difference.
I agree that restore defaults better describes what this button does than 
Selected Pulled Up. Opt to change the text.
fixed
