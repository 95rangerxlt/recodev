Build 20020205

The BinaryIndexer.extractReferenceFromConstantPool(byte[],ClassFileReader) 
method doesn't take all type references into account. The cases that come to 
mind are:
- type reference throw a static member access (e.g. X.foo())
- casting
- catch clause
- throw clause
etc...

Shouldn't we index all the entries of taged with ClassFileStruct.Class in the 
constant pool?

I thought they were referenced through the Field and Method ref. I added them.
I will check if 
9024 is fixed with this before I release the code.

9024 seems to be fixed with the change in the BinaryIndexer.
Released in HEAD.
Incremented index signature version so as to force reindexing.
addTypeReference(...) assumes that the type name is dot-separated. Changed 
extractReferenceFromConstantPool(...) to convert the name from being slash-
separated to dot-separated.
