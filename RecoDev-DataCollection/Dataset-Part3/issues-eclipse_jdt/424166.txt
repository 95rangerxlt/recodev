Cannot bind inplace (dialogless) extract method refactoring to keyboard shortcut, it is only available in quick fix menu.

This minor issue is, probably, an accidental omission, so quick fix action is not registered for key binding.

Could be fixed in a manner demonstrated by commit in my JDT fork

Two minor issues to consider for your next contribution:

1) The commit message should start with "Bug <bug nr>: <summary>" and also include the change-id, e.g.

Bug: 424166: [quick assist] Add key binding for Extract method Quick Assist

Change-Id: If7a11918f90e35a9930c55a02f162d2210def8b1
Signed-off-by: Ievgen Lukash <e.lucash@gmail.com>


2) All changed files should have the actual copyright date and your copyright info, e.g.
Eugene Lucash <e.lucash@gmail.com> - [quick assist] Add key binding for Extract method Quick Assist - https://bugs.eclipse.org/424166

I've done that with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=7a7f5fba4fb9ca143bacc8f985fa98b7d06f1f81


BTW, I got a bit confused by the two different names in bugzilla vs. Gerrit ;-).
Thanks for taking the time and completing this contribution!
Next time I will do exactly what you suggested for a well commit: 1) and 2)

As for the name, I created my Bugzilla account years ago, and only after some time received international passport with different spelling, for the CLA I've included name spelling that is officially correct. Will edit account to line this up ;)
The key binding should use the same letter key as the refactoring command (M). The "inplace" in the command name is not necessary ("Quick Assist" already tells that).

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=f6e68f34057b6c96fc588c5f987095b78c18456e
