I have a heirachy C derives from B derives from A.  A contains protected member
variable foo.  C contains a method bar() which references foo.  If I attempt to
pull-up bar() to B, the refactoring preview incorrectly informs me that foo
cannot be access from B.  

If I proceed, there are in fact no problems.

Markus, please investigate.
I20031015 + plugin-export 20031021: Can't reproduce.

David, could you please provide the build id you use?
Could you give me the concrete example code and the exact error message?

Here's my test case (pull up bar() to B, removing bar() from C):

public class A {
	protected int foo;
}

public class B extends A { }

public class C extends B {
	public void bar() {
		int i= foo;
	}
}
OK.  I did some additional testing.  This bug only occurs A is not part of this
project directly, but in a .JAR file used by this class.
Problem was that visibilty checks compared IPackageFragment objects instead of
their names. Also fixed in PushDown and MoveStaticMembers refactorings.
