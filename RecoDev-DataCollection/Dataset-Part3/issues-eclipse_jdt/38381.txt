When upgrading to a newer version of Eclipse, I normally keep my workspace 
(with my user preferences).
I noticed that new and changed Editor-templates existed when I created a new 
workspace. This means I could miss some new functionality when I don't create a 
new workspace.

If I want the new templates in my existing templates, I need to find out which 
templates have changed and export/import them.

There will be a new settings story which will allow us to store user and shared
settings in separate spaces. This will allow you to share data between workspaces.
New version should add the new templates to the shared store.
