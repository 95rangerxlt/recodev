The Open Implementation action should operate on the selected method, not on the enclosing one. The hyperlink works correctly, and the action should work the same. The resolution of the target element should work similar to the OpenAction.

We could keep the current behavior as fallback when no method could be resolved from the selection. That's how OpenCallHierarchyAction currently works.

Looks like this got broken with bug 285645.
