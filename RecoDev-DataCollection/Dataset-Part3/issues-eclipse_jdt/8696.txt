Enter the following class into Eclipse:

package foo;
public class Bar {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Object() {
			{ this. }	
		};
	}
}

Place your cursor after the 'this.' and press Ctrl+space.
Code assist fails to offer any suggestions.

If the inner class in not anonymous, code assist works as expected.

Worse, code assist seems not to work properly after an instance initializer in 
an anonymous innner class, even in code outside of the initializer.

Fixed
