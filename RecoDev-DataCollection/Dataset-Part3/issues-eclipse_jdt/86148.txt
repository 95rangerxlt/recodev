I am implementing decorators on resource mappings. One of the objects being 
decorated is this one. I think it is from the Projects view. When a traversal 
is requested, one is returned that contains a single resource but the resource 
is null.

I also noticed that some packages are not decorated and the Team menu does not 
appear. One such example is the org.eclipse.jdt.core package. I think this is 
a composite package. It should be possible to provide an appropriate resource 
mapping for these now.
Michael,

does this jar come in through a PDE container ? 
Yes, I configured my projects to use PDE containers
In the case of an external archive there isn't any corresponding resource in the
platform. I changed the code so that null is returned in this case. 

Michael, if you want to patch your code take version 1.4 of
JavaElementResourceMapping.

I will keep the PR open for the resource mapping request for logical packages,
which are a special thing in the browsing perspective.
We should provide a resource mapping for java working sets as well.
Has to wait for M7.
Fixed.
