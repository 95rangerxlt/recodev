Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

Using the following code:

public abstract class Test<T> {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Test<Button>() {
			void foo() {
			}
		};
		new Test<Strike>() {
			void foo() {
			}
		};
	}
}

When you hover over the name of either foo() method, the Javadoc rendering that shows is wrong: The first one displays an HTML button element containing everything after the class name, the second one strikes through that text. See attached screenshot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an anonymous instance of a class with a generic type
2. Implement a method in that class
3. View the javadoc on that method

Moving to JDT
JavaDoc display seems to be broken in 3.6. For example when I select java.util.Pattern, I get some output which is truncated, unformatted and overall weird. Can someone else confirm this? Is this the same bug or should I open a new one?

That is a separate issue. I guess you meant Javadoc of java.util.regex.Pattern (which renders fine for me). Aaron, if you're on Linux and SWT can't find a browser, we fall back to a text-only hover, which is known to have some bugs. If http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserlinux doesn't help, please open a new bug and attach a screenshot there.

That in fact solved the problem for me. I'll open an enhancement request to make this easier to find.
Only happened for members of parameterized anonymous types.
Fixed in JavaElementLabelComposer by cutting off the type arguments.

The "no browser widget on Linux"-issue is bug 321016.
