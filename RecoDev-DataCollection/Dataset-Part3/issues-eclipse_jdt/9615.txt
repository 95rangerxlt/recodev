Should I go further and disallow duplicate template names? The problem is that 
for code generation, there should be a mechanism to uniquely identify a 
template. However, for all the flavors of 'for'-template, I don't like the idea 
of having unique names. Should we even distinguish between default templates 
and user templates?
