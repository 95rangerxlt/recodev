build 20020502

-on a bidi platform turn on line highlighting in the Eclipse Java editor
-move to a different line
->observe the three pixels wide cheese the line highlighting leaves behind. 
Also, the first three pixels of the new line are not drawn in the backgound 
color. The three pixels is the x inset for the bidi cursor.

I also saw caret cheese when the caret was at the beginning of the line and in 
R2L mode. The caret direction indicator was leaving cheese behind in the three 
pixel wide space. Could not reproduce that one though.

To reproduce:

Make sure "Highlight current line" on for Java Editor.
Open a Java editor.
Put the cursor on a line.
Maximize the editor.
Move the cursor to another line.  You'll see margin cheese.

Margin cheese also occurs if you scroll the highlighted line out of view and 
then back into view and then move the cursor to another line.

This is a problem with jdt LinePainter.  The drawHighlightLine method should 
use an x value of 0 when it redraws.  On bidi platforms the left margin 
(necessary for displaying the bidi cursor) is included for line background 
coloring.
Also note that using the x of the first character on the line is not valid for 
bidi platforms (i.e., the logical first character of the line will not be the 
visual first character on the line if the character is the beginning of a 
hebrew/arabic text segment).

Please investigate status of this report.
This bug needs to be fixed by JDT.
