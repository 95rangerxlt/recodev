build I20051025-0800 + JDTCore head

I added a new option for th new camel case completion (bug 102572). This option
 could be added in preference page.

/**
* CODEASSIST / Activate Camel Case Sensitive Completion
*    When active, completion show proposals whose name match to the CamelCase
pattern.
*     - option id:         "org.eclipse.jdt.core.codeComplete.camelCaseMatch"
*     - possible values:   { "enabled", "disabled" }
*     - default:           "enabled"

I had temporary set the default value to "disabled".
As you fixed this bug i will set the default value to "enabled".

Is it OK for you ?
+1 - it's a cool feature that most of the users will like.
