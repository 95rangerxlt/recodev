English text:
Stepping into selection

When the caret is not in a method name, the feature steps into the next method on the selected line. When you e.g. have line with nested method calls and the caret is a the beginning of the line, the feature steps into the outermost method (unlike Step Into).

Question:
What do you mean by "unlike Step Into"? I don't understand what is unlike "Step Into" and what is not.
Could you provide some more explanation?

Reproducible: Always

"Step Into" is a command/action (labeled as such in the UI). I now marked it bold in the doc.
In addition to comment 1, I've fixed some typos in the paragraph before and replaced the abstract description by a concrete example:

For example, when the caret is at the beginning of the line<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertTrue(fFull.size() == 100)</code>,<br>
then <b>Step into Selection</b> steps into <code>assertTrue(..)</code>
(unlike <b>Step Into</b>, which would step into <code>size()</code>).</p>
