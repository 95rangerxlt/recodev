Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a public class, and within it define an internal class named 'Node'.
2. Add some code requiring imports of other classes.
3. Execute "organize imports".
3. OI wants to import a class named 'Node'. The local Node class is not an option on the import list. Canceling results in other imports not being done.

Sample code:
============

package test;

public class Test {
  private class Node {
    // does nothing
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Node x;
    // organize imports cannot resolve ArrayList unless
    // it first imports a different Node class
    ArrayList<Node> y;
  }
}

this got fixed in 3.3
