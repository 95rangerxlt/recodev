1. Start new workspace on JDK 1.4.2 with VM defaults (i.e. not increasing the 
default heap size)
2. Import all sdk plugins as binary linked projects
3. Open java.lang.Object
4. Search for references to Object in workspace
Observe: Near the end of the search, you get an OutOfMemoryError.

One trivial change could be made so as to accomodate VM defaults: simply 
reduce the amount of units processed at once by our match locator.
Currently, we batch 500 units at once.

Pls investigate, if trivial fix works, then +1 for RC3.
Decreasing the amount of units processed at once to 425 makes the 
OutOfMemoryError go away. 400 seems like a reasonable number.
+1 Dirk.
Change reviewed.
Changed MatchLocator.MAX_AT_ONCE to 400.
