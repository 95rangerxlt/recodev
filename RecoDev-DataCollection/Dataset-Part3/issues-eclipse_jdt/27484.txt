Int.HELLO should be underlined with a red line. Click insided it and press 
Ctrl+1 (quickfix). select create field. Once the field is created in the Int 
interface using the keyboard select the default null that is assigned to the 
field and replace it with a string e.g. "hello". Then move the cursor left to 
just before the equals and press tab. this results in a tab being placed after 
the string and before the ; rather than before the equals e.g:
----------------------
public interface Int
{
   String HELLO = "hello"  ;

}

I cannot reproduce this problem. Do you see it every time?
I do see it every time. My build is 200211151436. I think if you use the mouse 
to select the default null value it may not occur. It may also be Windows 
specific.
Martin, can you have a look?
When entring a string constant ("Hello"), the editor goes to a template mode 
and the following tab jumps to the end of the template.

I don't understand why it would be helpful to be in template mode. 
Moving to jdt.text

The editor is in template mode in order to be helpful when deleting characters. 
I.e. when deleting '"' the peer '"' is also deleted. We should be more eager to 
leave the template mode.
The caret is no longer updated on tab. Build > 20021210.
