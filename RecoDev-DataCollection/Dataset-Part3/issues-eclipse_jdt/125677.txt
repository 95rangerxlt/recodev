Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20060125-0800

I find the the @category tag not standing out enough in outline view.
e.g.
SomeType
+- method1() : int
+- method2() : int
+- method3() : int
+- accessor - getX() : int
+- accessor - getY() : int
+- SOME_CONSTANT : String

Visually, the grouping doesn't appear much. 
- Could it be emphasized, maybe offering some grouping ? (with intermediate 
node?) 
- Maybe the sorting button should offer a mode where it is combining items in same categories together (at least sorting them next to each other).
- Maybe using a bullet with a custom colour for a category ? (items in same category get a bullet of same colour?).

Using '[category]' could be a first step to improve this.

Having the extra artificial node is probably the best solution, however, adding artificial nodes (categories are not 'real' model element' makes rendering and delta treatment harder and is timer permitting for 3.2.
I agree for 3.2 and intermediate node. 
Logical grouping would still help there.
You can already group it now since the category is first in the label.

Oops, that's not true: we currently have two modes:
- unsorted i.e. same order as in source
- smart sort as defined on the Java > Appearance > Members Sort Order preference 
  page and implemented by JavaElementSorter

I filed bug 125697 to track the sorting issue.
I've fixed this as discussed. Filed bug 132326 to further investigate other solutions like grouping into the tree itself.

Fixed in HEAD.
