At several places we use IEditorInput.getAdapter(IJavaElement.class) to get the editor input as Java element.

This has several problem:
1) for IFile's this only works due to bug 120336
2) it does not work for all currently existing editor inputs
3) it completely fails for multi-page editors

To make it work for existing users of IEditorInput.getAdapter(IJavaElement.class) we have to register an adapter for IEditorInput.

In addition we will provide new API to get the editor input (see bug 111509).
