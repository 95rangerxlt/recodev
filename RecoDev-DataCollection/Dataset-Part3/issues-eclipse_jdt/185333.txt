0. start fresh workspace
1. go to Package Explorer
2. add a project
3. add a working set
4. add the project to that working set
2. view menu > Top Level Elements > Working Sets
==> customization dialog comes up with just 'Other Projects' preselected.

I would also expect that my working set(s) are pre-selected. I think that would be the 80% use case.

what are 'your' working sets? All existing Java working sets ?
When working in that mode I would like to see all my working set or at least only deselect some.
