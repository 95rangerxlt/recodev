There are three buttons (left, right, parent) on the package explorer tool bar that have no apparent use at all.  They seem to be intended to navigate the tree, but they're never active.

There is no way to remove these buttons (to save space for more tabs, or to be able to keep the width of the package explorer small enough without the buttons taking up an extra row of space) which is silly since the buttons don't even do anything and even if they did, their use for navigating a tree control seems of questionable value.

They only become active when you did a 'Go Into' from the context menu.

But I agree that until that happens we rather hide the toolbar items. Good point, these items have been there since 1.0.
