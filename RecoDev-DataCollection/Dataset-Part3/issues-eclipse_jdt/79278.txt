I20041117:

Create annotation:

public @interface Annotation {
 int property;
}

Invoke sef refactoring on "property"
-> property is private (illegal modifier in annotations) and accessor is 
static and has method body.

Apart from generating an accessor, sef is not of much value for annotations, 
so we might disable it.

Fixed for M4. Disabled SEF for fields in annotations since a getter in an
annotation isn't valid anyways.
