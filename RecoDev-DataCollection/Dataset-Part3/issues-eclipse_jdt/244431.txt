Outgoing changes after not modifying anything

Build: I20080807-1402

1) Checkout this project from CVS:

 /cvsroot/rt/org.eclipse.equinox/p2/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.tests

2) Open the Properties dialog on the project

3) Click or arrow down to visit each of the JDT property pages

4) Click OK to close the dialog without modifying anything

Expected: No outgoing changes to preference files since I didn't modify anything

Actual: Both jdt.core.prefs and jdt.ui.prefs have outgoing changes. I will attach a patch showing all the outgoing changes.

I'd say this is INVALID because between the time the .settings file was last saved and the time you hit the 'OK' button some of the defaults might have changed and new prefs might have been added. In order to commit your OK clicking to the repository the settings file needs to be updated. Or do you claim that neither of those two cases apply here?
My expectation is that looking at properties should not change anything. See also bug 153421 comment 1.
As said, it depends whether it is anticipated or not. I assume you would also be surprised if you look (not just click,click click) and explicitly give the OK to the seen preferences then verify whether you need to commit something and then go to another workspace checkout the project and you get completely different values. 

The other bug is different because it is about an out-of the box behavior with a project that is defined to not have shared settings.

Having said that, I need to check each change to the settings whether they are OK i.e. whether they happen on shared properties and new/changed defaults.
>jdt.ui.prefs
Most of those changes are OK: those are new save action settings and if you compare the new entries with new/fresh save action settings they are identical. There is however a bug on the code template page: it always stores project specific settings even if not enabled. I've fixed this in HEAD. Please note that even with the fix you'll get a change for the code templates (removal of entry since they aren't set per project).


>jdt.core.prefs
All the changes are due to new prefs or changed defaults. The following line which gets removed is completely strange (no idea how this came into the file):
instance/org.eclipse.core.net/org.eclipse.core.net.hasMigrated=true
