If you are writing some java and you press ctrl+space to get the suggestion 
popup window, as soon as the window appears, the whole eclipse looses focus. 
If you want to select something from the popup, you have to grab the mouse and 
to click in the window.

This appens using every editor in Eclipse.

I tested rel. 2.1.1 and 3.0M4 with the same effects
The same versions on Win2k work fine.

Thanks

Cannot reproduce using WinXP. Did you tweak WinXP (e.g. using TeakUI)? If so,
what did you do.


I have installed these TweakUI tools:
- Alt-Tab Replacement
- Open Command Window Here
- Tweak UI

Now i just uninstalled the "Alt tab" tweak but nothing changed.

I noticed that, if i logon on my pc (a Toshiba M10 laptop) using 
the "administrator" account, Eclipse works fine.
If i use my domain account, the problem appears.

I compared the Tweaks i applied between the two users, but they are identical.
I just deativated the CDRom autorun, enable directory and file completition in 
dos windows and removed the "Shortcut to" in shortcuts.

Is there anything more i could report you to help reproduce the bug ?

Thanks very much for your work

check options that have to to with "bringToFront". E.g. bring to front if mouse
is over window or selection changed in a window.

I managed to fix the problem.

It was caused by the nVidia "NView Desktop Manager" that comes preinstalled on 
Toshiba M10. (Nview.dll version is 6.13.10.3648)

I disabled it from the control panel and the problem disappered.

Thanks again for your support
Stefano
