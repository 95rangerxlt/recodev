Build: 2.1 M3

The automatic line breaking in javadoc comments will break up words separated by
the period character, even if there is no whitespace.  For example, the comment:

/**
 * This is a javadoc comment that makes a reference to <code>java.lang.
 * String</code>
 */

It has broken up java.lang.String across lines.  I think it should keep words
together unless separated by whitespace.

this appears to be fixed.
