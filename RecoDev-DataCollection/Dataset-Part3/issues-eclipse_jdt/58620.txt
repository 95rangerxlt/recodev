The spell checker is neat, but needs an option to be able to ignore characters 
that have been encoded using the HTML &xxx; syntax - for example &quot;, &lt;, 
&plusmn; etc

I raise this as a bug, not a new feature, as the ability to exclude certain 
types of text from spell checking (words with digits etc) is already in place
