In build 200209171408, 
"Ctrl-X Ctrl-S" suppose to be "Save" in emacs keyboard mapping, but it gives 
me "Incremental Find".

In build 200208060815, it works.
When I press "Ctrl-X ", "ctrl-X" shows on the status bar, and then I 
press "ctrl-s" it saves the fild.

Changed version as this error is on the 2.1 stream. It works in 2.0.1.
The key binding issuses are targeted for the 2.1 M2 - M3 milestone.

Verified that this keybinding is working using R3.4 M6a on Mac and Vista.

However, I did find an unrelated issue that can make it *appear* to be still failing. See bug 226842.
