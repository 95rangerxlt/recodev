Build 20020418

Example:

public class A {
	A f;
	public A a() {
		a().f= a();
		return null;
	}
}


The start position of the expression statement a().f= a() is 48 but should be 
44. Note that the start position of LHS of the assignment is correct (e.g 44).

}


The start position of the expression statement a().f= a() is 48 but should be

Should be fixed for next integration build.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
