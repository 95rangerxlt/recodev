Sometimes closing braces are not highlighted in Eclipse when the cursor is moved to one closing brace.  This seems to happen in long code segments where the other brace is off screen.  For example, in the replaceItem method in ContributionManager the opposing brace is not highlighted.

Can reproduce using I20060905-1250 with ContributionManager imported from said build.
This has been introduced by fixing bug 149520.

Christian, can you take a look at that for M2? This means that your version of the JavaPairMatcher, the DefaultCharacterPairMatcher or both have a bug.

I reverted the JavaPairMatcher for now.

NOTE: an additional test catching this would be great.
Darn.  I'll fix this.

Fix

The attached patch should fix the problem.  It turns out that the new matcher didn't handle unmatched characters well, for instance the "unmatched" angle bracket in '(x < y)'.
Released patch to HEAD.

Thanks for the quick response.
