There are cases where code assist pops up for free. For example, I typed

deleteAction = new Action(

and code assist popped up automatically. This is bad, as now I have to perform 
a manual action to get rid of something I didn't ask for. Leaving it up slows 
down every keystroke and is annoying. Please either remove this behaviour or 
make it configurable.
