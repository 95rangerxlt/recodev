When referencing external jars in a Java project, it is possible to filter out
these referenced jars (Navigator->Filters...->Referenced libraries), so that
they do not take up space in the navigator when expanding a project's root.

When adding local jars to the build path (jars that resides within the project
itself) there is no natural mean of filtering those away, there should exist
another filter og the existing filter should be extended to excluded these
locally referenced libraries as well.

For example, when developing a WAR, the jars in the WEB-INF/lib are naturally
added to the build path. When having alot of jars in the lib folder, this takes
up too much space when having the project expanded.

dup of bug 20010
3.0 offers a filter to filter out referenced libraries (internal and external).
3.0M5 only contains a filter that (quote) "Hides referenced libraries i.e. those
not contained inside the project itself".

If the other filter already exists, please let me know (couldn't find it in 3.0M5).

As said the filter only filters out references libraries (external and 
internal) not libraries that are located in the project itself (those are not 
referenced).

Reopened. But it is unclear if we will add such a filter for 3.0.
It would be nice if you did.

Tools like WebSphere Studio Application Developer and MyEclipseIDE adds the
stuff in WEB-INF/lib automatically (by default anyway) to the build path and
having alot of jars in that folder takes up alot of (vertical) space in the
Package Explorer.

Thanks for reopening the bug.

Would be a very useful feature. Indeed jar list might get long but rarely looked at.

Another way of implementing it might be NOT using filter but rather grouping all these jar in some sub-tree item so that they can be collapsed (and seen only when needed)
I'd also prefer the "hide in subitem" approach.

Granted, it would break the WYSIWYG (or better: what you have on disk). OTOH, I have several pretty large projects with a lot of JARs which I would like to hide but sometimes, I have to look into them, as well, so a quick way to make them visible again would be great.

I'd even suggest to create a recursive item which shows what is imported from referenced projects (JARs, sources, etc) in sub-folders so you can quickly navigate to those items, too.
This is my number one anoyance with Eclipse (It might even be my only anoyance). I would love to see this enchancement implemented.
