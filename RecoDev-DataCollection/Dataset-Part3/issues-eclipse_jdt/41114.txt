I would suggest that a button/function is added to Eclipse that changes all 
settings to conform to the Sun Code Conventions.

This is probably loosely connected to bug 28859, bug 36425, and bug 15286.

Our new formatter will support such a named set of preferences.
This is addressed in the new formatter. The sun settings will be available when
the ui is ready to show the new code formatter preference pages. This won't be
done for 3.0M4. The Sun settings won't be the default settings, but it will be
possible to change the default settings to be the Sun ones.
UI preference page should be ready for 3.0M5.

Move to JDT/UI.
Please close once the preference page is available.
The Java Conventions settings are now available with our new preference page
(enable the new formatter on "Work in Progress").
