The call hierarchy component implements IViewSite which is not allowed. There
seems to be no reason for doing so: the CallHierarchyViewPart should directly
set the selection provider to its site.
It's true that I have implemented an adapter implementing IViewSite. The problem
is that the CallHierarchyViewPart's TreeViewer doesn't contain IJavaElements but
instead MethodWrapper instances. These are needed for some of the internal
actions so it is - as I see it - not possible to have the selection provider for
the view part map into IJavaElements.

However, I also reuse some of the "standard" JDT UI actions (e.g.
OpenEditorActionGroup) which take a IViewPart and expecting its the selection
provider to deliver IJavaElements - without adapting to them.

I'm not really sure what else to do (except mindlessly copying the standard JDT
UI actions). Suggestions/pointers are gladly received.
can't you set the selection provider for those who listen to selection changes
via API/view site and user your own selection listener on the tree viewer? You
said yourself that you use it internally.

The dependency has to go away for 3.0.
Daniel,

That strategy might be feasible. I'll look into it.
Good. As you might have seen on the mailing lists, Platform UI reverted their
change to this interface for M5 so that we compile again.
I may have difficulties fixing this for M5. Is that a problem? I'd prefer trying
to reach some time in the end of next week, if that is acceptable.
As stated in comment 4 they reverted to the old code for M5 to give us more time
(we have other areas that are not ready yet as well for that change). No need to
hurry, you can target 3.0 M6

Removed the dependency on IViewSite

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.callhierarchy.

Removed the class that implemented IViewSite. Changed the way the
CallHierarchyViewPart generates selection changes.

Also cleaned up some unused code (e.g. some ancient navigation methods which
have long ago been replaced by actions).
Markus,
please apply the patch. Note that I had to change all JDT classes that implement
IViewSite/IWorkbenchPartSite to also implement IAdaptable (as requested by the
Platform UI team). I've done this by extending PlatformObject. I am not sure
whether the patch is already based on that fact.

When you apply the patch ensure that the site no longer implements PlatformObject.

Thanks.
Markus,

The patch simply removes the classes that Daniel has previously modified since
they are no longer needed.
Thanks, Jesper.
