I highlight a block of Java code to indent and use Shift-Tab to move the code 
back 4 spaces.  This works fine but the problem is that cutting-and-pasting
code in Eclipse usually doesn't align the code properly to the code that I'm 
pasting into (for instance, the inserted code is offset by 2 or 3 spaces 
instead of 4 like the rest of the code).  In other Java IDEs I would Shift-Tab 
the code all the way to the left margin and then Shift it back to align; but in 
Eclipse you can't Shift-Tab all the way to the left margin if the line has 
spaces at the beginning, so you need to click on each line and Tab it.

Basically, I'm looking for a way to automatically line up the code with the 
appropriate tab settings, so I don't get a file with 5 different forms of 
indentation.

I guess your main concern "a way to automatically line up the code with the 
appropriate tab settings" is covered by 'Correct Indentation'. 

The other concern, being able to shift-tab leading spaces, is covered by bug 40823.

Marking as fixed, since the main concern is fixed.
