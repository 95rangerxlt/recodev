we already show the override indicator in the outline view.
But you have erronously concluded that I have the outline view open at all 
times. I only have the single file I am editing open and no outline view! For 
me to know if a method is overriding another method I have to open the outline 
view ... I should be able to tell directly from the file that I am editing. 

Another option you have is to use the quick outline (ctrl-o). It also shows you 
the override indicators.
OK, ctrl-o is great, but I still think that nothing beats being able to that 
info directly in the editor, and then, if the icon is clicked on, it would 
transport you to the method it is overriding.
