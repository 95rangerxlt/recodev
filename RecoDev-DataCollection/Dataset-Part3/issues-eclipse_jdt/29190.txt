The only way (?) to set the Javadoc location for a Library of a Project is to 
do:

1. Package Explorer > Filters : do not hide referenced libraries
2. set Javadoc Location in Library node's Properties setting

there you can also attach the source for the library.


In Package Explorer : Project : Properties : JavaBuildPath : Libraries, you can 
attach a source for a library but you can't set the javadoc location for the 
library. Several people already asked me if this is possible and how this is 
done, and most of them instandly said, that this should (also) be configurable 
in the project settings:javabuildpath:libraries.

It's kind of logic, isn't it!

Martin, is there are reason why this is not possible.
this is possible with the new build path dialog (in M4)
