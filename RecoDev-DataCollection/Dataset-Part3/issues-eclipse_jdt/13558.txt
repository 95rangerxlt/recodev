try moving a cu from 1 package to another - dnd of not - 
no not press 'preview' 

nothing happens - file is not moved!
it is moved if you do press 'preview'
it is caused by this:

nasty - opt to fix asap
it is a result of the recent validateEdit changes

some posibilities of fix - if it is to be fix quickly:

A. do not use validateEdit in this refactoring - go back to the old code 
(cons: known - clear case users are unhappy,
pros: easy to do)

B. do call validateEdit and quietly fail if there's a read-only file that is to 
be changed (just perform nothing in such a case)
(pros: we keep validateEdit in the 'preview' scenario 
and it mostly works in the non-preview one because read-only files are rare

cons: quietly failing)

C. force users to see the preview
pros: relatively easy to fix
cons: non-preview ui in dnd is desirable

D. remove the update reference smartness

The Real Fix would be to be able to show the error page after problems 
with dnd as well

i guess i opt for B

This refactoring is an important function of Eclipse. We propose to fix it for 
M5. Given that this drop should enable clear case users we should do option B.
i can do better than B - if there are read-only files, simply no references 
will be updated, but the file will be moved nonetheless
was partially fixed for 20020412, should fully fix for M6
done
