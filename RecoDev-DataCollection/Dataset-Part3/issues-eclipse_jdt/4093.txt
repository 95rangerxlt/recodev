Not at all important, but I thought I'd document it.

When viewing the Properties of a Web Project, on the Order tab of the Java 
Build Path page,
the Build class path listbox initially has a horizontal scroll bar (the class 
paths are wider
than the listbox).  If you drag the scrollbar thumb to the right, the listbox 
does not scroll
and the scrollbar disappears.
