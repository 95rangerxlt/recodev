Build id: 200308281813

Selecting java compiler preferences results in
a dialog box saying:

The currently displayed page contains invalid values

When I select another preference, and then compiler
again, no error appears, but only one page of
severity level settings is displayed.

I used Sun J2SDK 1.4.2 on Linux, but IBM J2SDK 1.4.1
is the same.

The settings are the same for Linux and Windows and it doesn't fail on Windows.
Move to JDT/UI for comment.
This problem is caused by a broken ComboBox event notification under Linux-GTK 
and is already fixed for next integration build.

See bug 42266.
