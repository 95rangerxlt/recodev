Do i replace any text with another text and set the cursor after the 
a location of the text and select the option "backward", i become 
the message, "string not found".
But, i set the cursor before the location of text and select the option
"forward", the text is correct replaced.

I use eclipse 20020125.
the problem exists in the gtk- and motif-version.
