There are no mnemonics on the tabs for the Java Build Path properties page
Silvio, can you please add the missing mnemonics.


20031216/20031218: Could not reproduce, I have the mnemonics: right-click on a
project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> hit ALT: 

&Source | &Projects | &Libraries | &Order and Export

Closing, please re-assign and clarify if necessary.
This doesn't work for me on XP. It is fine for the Java Compiler Page so it 
doesn't look like a general issue.
Hmm, strange, I'm also using XP and the mnemonics are perfectly functional. 

What about other mnemonics on this page, are they visible/working? 
Can you provide a screen shot? 
Does it work with the m6 release?

Thanks.

Bizarre. I looked at it with 1216 and no menmonics. Just rechecked with M6 and 
lo and behold there they are. 

I'll close this PR and reopen it if the problem comes back.
