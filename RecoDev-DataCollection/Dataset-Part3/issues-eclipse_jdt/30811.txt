Pull up doesn't support static fields, methods and inner classes. We should 
support pushing up these as well (at least for static inner classes).

Please investigate if we can do something for RC1

Same is true for pull down
If we only support a set of members the action should be enabled anyway and a 
dialog should tell me why the opation can't be executed. Otherwise it is hard 
for a user to find out why pullup/push down isn't in the menu.
ok, simply a question of moving stuff from one activation checking method to 
another

for push down, there's no way in general

class A{
 static void f(){}
}
class B1 extends A{}
class B2 extends A{}
class C{
  void foo(){
     A.f();  //<<<no way to change this call
  }
}

for virtual calls you can always declare f as abstract and leave callers 
unchanged

so no action for push down for 2.1
implemented

side note: only the pulled up typed will be deleted from the subclasses of the 
target class (unlike methods, where you can select which ones to delete and 
unlike fields where all fields with matching names are deleted).
this sounded like the right thing to do (maybe making it possible to choose 
what to delete would've been better but then a ui problem arises of how to 
present, in 1 tree, members types as distinct from subtypes. if tyis is to be 
done, then it'll be after 2.1)
