I wonder why these just showed up?  We have not updated the map files for several weeks, and previous I-builds don't show these warnings.  Did the default warning level change for I-builds?

Anyway, these are fixed in HEAD but I've not yet released the updated map files, pending a bit more testing on the other changes that went in at the same time.  Will do so by the next I-build.
There do not appear to be any warnings now in the releng builds.  There are still some warnings that show up in the IDE, having to do with deprecated items, but I'll deal with those separately.
