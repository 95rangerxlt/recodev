I was entered the following method.

public void goto(Frame frame) {
}

The compiler gave me an error for "goto":
Syntax error on token "Invalid Character", "Identifier" expected

Presumably this is because "goto" is a keyword.

The error message is very confusing, though.
I would expect something like:
Syntax error on keyword "goto"; Identifier expected instead

It didn't help that the Java text editor doesn't colour "goto" as a keyword.
See 1GCTE5I: ITPJUI:WIN2000 - Java text editor: "goto" is a keyword

Would be interesting to see if we can improve a few error messages in the 
parser by substitutions.
What do you mean by "by substitutions"?
Something similar to what we do for unary expressions.

Fixed and released in HEAD. Some tests had to be updated as well. They relied on 
the old parse error message even if the token on which the error occured was a 
keyword.
These tests are test035, test173 and test174 in the NegativeTest suite.
