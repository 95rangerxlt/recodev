I20080122-1600

"Preferences > Java > Errors/Warnings > Unnecessary Code" has two options
("Parameter is never read" and "Unnecessary declaration of thrown exception") with sub-options named "Check overriding and implementing methods".

Unfortunately, the label of the sub-option is ambiguous. It could either mean
a) "also check for the problem in a method that overrides or implements another method", or
b) "also consider all methods that override a method 'm' to decide whether the parameter/exception is considered as unused in 'm'"

The implemented options are really case (a).
Case (b) is requested in bug 201759 and bug 183339.

To avoid confusion and wasting brain cycles of users, the label should only allow one interpretation. I suggest to invert the sense of the checkbox and rename it to:
"Ignore in overriding and implementing methods" (checked by default).

This label cannot mean "Ignore if necessary in another method in hierarchy", and it aligns well with the other "Ignore ..." sub-options.
