As of 3.0M6, there appears to be no way to export a jar, with a relative name
saved in the jardesc, so that the jar is exported relative to the project dir,
if the project dir is not underneath the workspace.

Entering a relative path makes that path relative to the workspace, which has no
relationship to the project dir in this case. Using the browse button and
picking the project dir results in an absolute path entered in the path field.

I personally never put my project dirs under the workspace, since I often share
them between different Eclipse versions, so this restriction is really annoying.
It means that I can not properly check in the jardesc to CVS to be used by others.

One way to achieve this is to use an ANT script.

This got fixed a while ago.
