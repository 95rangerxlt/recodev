Using build 10182001

When a java editor gains focus, it shows only the package declaration for that 
compilation unit.  This is arguably the *least* useful thing to show when the 
editor first gets focus.  If I select a whole compilation unit in the packages 
view, I expect to see the whole compilation unit in the editor.

One more subtle bug caused by this behaviour (this is with the java method 
editor):

1) Expand packages view to compilation unit, double click to open editor
2) Expand CU in packages view to show imports, type definitions
3) In packages view, select "import declarations"
4) Click in the editor, it switches back to show only the package declaration.

This means it's impossible to edit the imports using only the packages view and 
the editor!
