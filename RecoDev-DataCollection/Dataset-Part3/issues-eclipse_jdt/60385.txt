I use two monitors and have eclipse running on the second monitor.
Quick views, however, currently open on the first monitor.
I know that the views remember their position, so maybe the position was stored
when I was working with a single monitor. If that's the case I would suggest to
store the dialog position only for a session (say, forget when eclipse is exited),

I added a second display that was a different size than my primary display. I moved the workbench to 
the secondary display and found that various popups e.g. rename popped up in the logical middle of 
the overall display instead of centered on the workbench itself. Unlike others who have two displays of 
equal size, having different sized displays actually shows the problem better.

bug 99078 suggests several possible solutions

Patch for OpenTypeSelectionDialog

Fixes this bug for the open type dialog

Makes the following changes:
- Removes the code that attempts to remember the dialog's location (uses the
default location supplied by Window, which is multimonitor-friendly).
- Removes the redundant clipping code that prevents the dialog from being
larger than the display (the Window class does this already, so the code was
redundant)
Correction: that patch is for OpenTypeSelectionDialog2
The quick outline seems to have its location set in
AbstractInformationControlManager.internalShowInformationControl.

Stefan, the OpenTypeSelectionDialog(2) is unrelated to quick views. If you
experience a problem with that one, please file a separate bug report and attach
your patch there.
I did. Bug 99078 was marked as a dupe.
Reopened bug 99078 to focus on the open type issue.

My setup is the following: 2 workbench windows each of them on separate display
Thus I believe the request should be:
1) Quick views and dialogs should remember their position per display
2) Quick views and dialogs should open on the display the workbench
   window invoking the action opening the quick view/dialog is shown on.
3) It should never happen, that a quick view/dialog opens on a display
   different from the display of the focus workbench window.
We're now using the PopupDialog which should handle this.
