Sometimes on "organize imports" Eclipse asks me if I want to add:

org.xml.sax.SAXException
  or
org.xml.sax.SAXException

This is because I have two XML/HTML/SAX parsers (or whatever) in my classpath.
Now regardless of which one I choose I always get the same import row in my
source; thus the dialog is redundant and can be removed.
