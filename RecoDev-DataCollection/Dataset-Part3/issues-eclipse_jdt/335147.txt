proposed patch

- It is useful to see the abbreviated package names in all java viewers - less information to parse.
- If the editor is not maximized, quite often some labels in the breadcrumb are hidden. Abbreviating the package names a little in reducing the length of the breadcrumb.

Markus, is there any reason to not do this? (In Bug 329677 we had fixed the same problem in other places, but I do not recall if we missed to fix breadcrumb or it was deliberate)

That's fine for me. You can release the patch iff you've done the necessary testing (e.g. Copy and Copy Qualified Name still work).
Fixed in HEAD.
