Steps to reproduce:
1. Invoke "Encapsulate Field" on "o" in code below.
2. There is a compilation error ("Illegal modifier for the interface field") after applying the refactoring. 

public interface EncapsulateFieldBug {

    // Invoke "Encapsulate Field" on "o"
    public static final Object o = new Object();
}

Similar issue has been recently fixed: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=377318.

Issue is not reproducible using I20121210-0800. The refactoring option "Encapsulate Field" is not appearing on "o". This issue should have been fixed with bug 377318
