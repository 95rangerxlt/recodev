when i have a compile error i get a little red x in the left side of the
editor, and i get a little red box in the right side, that shows the error
location relative to the whole file length.
is there any way to get the search results shown in the same way?
when i search for something i see ".. (5 matches found)" in the search
box, and when i click it i go to the first occurance in the editor. Now it
would be nice if i had little yellow boxes in the right side that shows me
where the other occuances is in the file.

Actually this is a nice idea. But we are in a mode where we only consider 
critical bugs for 2.0
