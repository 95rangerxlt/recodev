Currently using code completion for @link in javadoc won't add the closing 
brace which has become a common error.  Would like for this closing brace to be 
added automatically.

{@link SomeClass#someMethod()}

{@link SomeClass#someMethod()}
Good suggestion. It should add:
{@link SomeClass#someMethod()<caret>}

It's now much simpler to add links in Javadoc.
