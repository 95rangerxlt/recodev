If I have an inner-class and it has javadoc in it. I select the inner class, go to Refactor, Move Type to New File, and the new file is created. Looking at the new file though, you'll see that the code template for Comments -> Files is ignored, and my document starts immediately with the package declaration

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Window | Preferences, Java\Code Style\Code Templates.
2. Define a pattern for Comments\Files
3. Create a class containing an inner class. Be sure to create a comment at the class level for the inner class.
E.g.

/**
 * Hello World
 *
 */
public class Foo
{
  /**
   * Goodbye World
   */
  public static class Bar
  {
  }
}

4. Select the inner class element, and go to Refactor | Move Type to New File. Have a look at the new file. It's missing your file comment at the beginning of the file prior to package declaration.
5. Undo your refactor
6. Remove the comment for Bar. Try refactoring again. This time Bar will have the proper file level comment prior to the package declaration.

I haven't gone as far as checking other code template stuff, but perhaps there's problems with other templates too?

Move to JDT/UI
To reproduce, make sure to enable "Automatically add comments for new methods and types" on the code template preference page.
