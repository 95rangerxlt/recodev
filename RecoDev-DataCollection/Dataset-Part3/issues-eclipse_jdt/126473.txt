Leading up to the API freeze, I have renamed the following classes/interfaces:

IResourceMappingScope renamed to ISynchronizationScope
ICompareAdapter rename to ISynchronizationCompareAdapter
AbstractCompareAdapter renamed to SynchronizationCompareAdapter

Stubs are in place for the old classes so this change will not cause any compile errors.

I have updated references to the three types in our code. However, there is still a reference to IResourceMappingScope in SynchronizationContentProvider#isInScope(...). Since this method is overridden, it requires a coordinated release. I suggest to to it for the M5 warm-up build.
Sounds good
