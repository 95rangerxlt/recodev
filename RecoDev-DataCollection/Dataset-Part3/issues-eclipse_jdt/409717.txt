The Javadoc in javax.lang.model's package-info.java (in attached source) contains: "{@linkplain javax.annotation.processing annotation processing}"

The parsing of this link fails in JavaElementLinks#parseURI(URI) because the
"if (element instanceof IPackageFragment)" branch only resolves types, but not packages. We should use the same code as in "if (element instanceof IType)" to resolve a link to package as well.

Also need to check whether the Javadoc tool supports links to members. If it does, then reuse that part of "if (element instanceof IType)" as well.

And last but not least, Javadocs of JavaElementLinks need to tell that refTypeName can also refer to a package.

Manju, please have a look for 4.4.
Make sure we continue to only support fully-qualified type name references in package-info.java, see bug 216451.

Patch.

Handled resolving of package links appearing in attached package-info.java file.

Verified that links to members in package-info.java are supported in Javadoc generated by the Javadoc tool. e.g. : {@linkplain javax.lang.model.element.AnnotationMirror#getAnnotationType() annotationMethod}. This is supported in the current implementation of JavaElementLinks.
Javadoc generated by Javadoc tool supports only fully qualified type name references in package-info.java, this behavior is maintained in our views as well.

Updated the Javadoc for 'refTypeName' in JavaElementLinks#createURI(...)

Markus, kindly review.
Looks good, please release.
Thanks Markus. Released the fix as:
