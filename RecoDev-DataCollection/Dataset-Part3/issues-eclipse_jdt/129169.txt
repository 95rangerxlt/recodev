since the results from using the call hierarchy view are methods, it would make sense that I would be able to toggle breakpoints on the methods.

We have an object contribution for methods, so if they were methods, the action would appear. Must be search results, wrapping a method. Perhaps we can use an adapter to get the right behavior.
Martin, what sort of objects appear in the call hierarchy view? how do you get your "method" actions to appear for the objects?
That's a bug in the call hierarchy. We just had a look at it and its a simple fix.
The Call Hierarchy supplied a wrong selection provider when registering the context menu. I fixed that in HEAD, and now contributions show up in the context menu, since the externally visible selection now consists of IMethods.

Darin, you can mark this as fixed, or assign it to me so I can set the bit.
Re-assigning to JUI
Fixed.
