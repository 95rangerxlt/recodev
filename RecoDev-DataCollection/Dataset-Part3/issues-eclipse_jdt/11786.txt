1) Copy and paste 'junit.ui'.
2) Observe: the resulting package is named 'ui'. It should be something like
   'copy.of.junit.ui' or 'junit.ui.copy.of'.
   Also compile errors are introduced as the CUs still expect the package name
   to be 'junit.ui'.
3) Paste again.
   There's a new folder (not package) called 'Copy of ui'.
   It should remain a package and have package-like names.
