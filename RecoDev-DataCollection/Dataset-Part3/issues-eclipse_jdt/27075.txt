opening a second java editor

this takes 4.5 % of opening java editor (second editor)
If creating Collator.getInstance() is the expensive thing:
ViewerSorter should delay it and only create it when really needed ('getCollator

It also could keep it as a static singleton.

would be breaking.

Implementating the lazy initialisation in the JavaElementSorter.
