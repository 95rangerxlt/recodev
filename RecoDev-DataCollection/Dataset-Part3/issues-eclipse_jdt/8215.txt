Run Pull up on TestCase.setUp (copies the method to Assert)
This offers me to delete methods in SimpleTest, VectorTest....

For these classes it makes no difference if setUp is in testCase or Assert

Fact is, the delete dialog is to more confusing than helpful.

Instead of 'Fact is' I more wanted to say 'For me'
The 'setUp' method in testCase could be selected by default in the delete tree.
It should be at the top, ahead of the types.
we should try to improve it. Adam let's discuss.
fixed by not showing subtypes of the type that declares pulled up elements
