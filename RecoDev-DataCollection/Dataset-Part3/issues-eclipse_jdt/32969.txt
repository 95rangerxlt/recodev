This works for methods so it should not be to complicated to fix for

fixed > 20030303

added test case LocalCorrectionsQuickFixTest.testUncaughtExceptionOnSuper2

Note that there is still no quick fix for exceptions thrown in _implicit_
constructor invocations. This is more work (need another bug report)
