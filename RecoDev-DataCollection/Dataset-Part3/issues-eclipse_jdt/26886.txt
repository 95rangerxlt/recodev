I can´t use the resource of "rerun" in one method, when I am debugging a JUnit 
Test. Not even if the option "Keep JUnit running after a test run when 
debugging " be marked. I always receive the following message: "Could not 
reload Test: null".

Moving to JUI.
Support for rerunning a single test got added in M4. Pls verify that your 
scenario is covered and reopend if it is still a problem.
