1. Create new Java Project with Junit
	2. In Packages view: rename TestCase.java to Test$Case.java
		==> OK
	2. Now rename it back to TestCase.java
	==> Compile errors

	warning is correctly prosented 
	searching for all occurrences of Test$Case fails to find any
	refactoring code cannot do anything in that case

	suggest to not fix now - corner case
	and undo works fine

	moving to jcore for comment on why no occurrences of Test$Case are found

	Problem is that the search pattern created from the java element Test$Case is wrong.
	It assumes that the $ is a type separator and it creates a TypeReferencePattern
	with a 'Case'  simple name, and 'Test' enclosing type name.
	Need to rewrite createTypePattern(...)

	Need to rewrite createTypePattern(...)
Rewrote createTypePattern(...) to handle the $ case.
Also needed to fix NameLookup.seekTypesInSourcePackage(...) as this was also 
considering that the type Test$Case was included in the Test.java compilation 
unit.
Added JavaSearchTests.testTypeOccurenceWithDollar()
PRODUCT VERSION:
	Smoke 124 i.e. build input 1 for 0.124
