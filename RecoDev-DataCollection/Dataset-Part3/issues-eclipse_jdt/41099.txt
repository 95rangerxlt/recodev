Moving to JDT/UI.

This happens if you associate file extensions other than .java to the Java
Editor and try to open a file having such extension with that editor. I don't
think that it is a very useful thing to do (since most features require a valid
Java compilation unit to work properly), but it could fail more gracefully.

By the way, why do you want to do that?
The reason I use the Java editor for editing files other than java files, is because it is the only editor 
that seems to support the 'spaces for tabs' option.  In my company, our code standards prohibit 
tabs.  Exactly four spaces must be used for indentation, and the easiest way to do this in eclipse is 
to just use the Java Editor.  This would be an excellent feature to include with the Ant editor, as 
well as all other code editors.  Should I file a feature or bug request for this?
This is not a major bug because:
- the editor comes up and you can work with the editor
- the Java editor is designed to edit Java files

Agree with comment 3.

Yes, filing a feature request against Ant is the right approach if you want to
see this feature in the Ant editor.

This has been fixed.
