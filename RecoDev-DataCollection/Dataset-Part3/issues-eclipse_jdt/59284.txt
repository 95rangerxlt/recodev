1. do 'Introduce Factory' on OldASTRewrite(ASTNode) in jdt.corext.dom
2. The created factory method is
public static OldASTRewrite createOldASTRewrite(
      org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTNode node) {
		return new OldASTRewrite(node);
	}

It should use the import rewriter and not fully qualify the type name

Agree.
Yes, IntroduceFactoryRefactoring used ASTNodeFactory.newType() which knows 
nothing about imports. For M9, I'll fix it in IntroduceFactoryRefactoring, but 
perhaps in the long run, ASTNodeFactory.newType() should take an ImportRewrite 
argument rather than the boolean "fullyQualify" argument. Or another 
possibility is to add another flavor of the newType() method that takes an 
ImportRewrite.
