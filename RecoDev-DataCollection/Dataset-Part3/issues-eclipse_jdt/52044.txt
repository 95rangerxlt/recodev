In 3.0M7 I turned on spell checking in comments. When I hover over a 
misspelled word, the tooltip warning says something like "The world 'barley' 
is not correctly spelt".

Now, according to websters, "spelt" is "A hardy wheat grown mostly in Europe." 
So I suppose Eclipse is smart enough now to know the difference between barley 
and wheat. Perhaps this was an agricultural plug-in that EDS insisted the team 
install in the base SDK.

Or perhaps I just learnt it wrong in school 
(http://help.englishclub.com/el_spell.htm).

You're correct that "spelt" is used in Britain.  Canadians use the British 
spelling for many words, such as "colour" instead of "color".  Don't forget 
that many of the Eclipse developers are from Canada, so this might be the 
reason for "spelt" rather than "spelled".  Personally I like "spelt".

By the way, I don't think you meant to spell "word" as "world".  ;-)
>...that many of the Eclipse developers are from Canada, 
And some are even from Europe and educated with British English ;-)

Nevertheless, Eclipse normally uses American English.
