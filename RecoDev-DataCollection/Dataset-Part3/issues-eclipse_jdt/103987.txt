JUnit view has that nice feature of being able to select a test (-method) run in
either "Failures" or "Hierary" tab and run or debug it again. Alas, this
feature's use is limited, because the "Failures" and "Hierarchy" tab is cleared
more often than necessary, at least as it occurs necessary to me ;)

An example: I run a JUnit test (using a JUnit launch configuration) on a single
test class. Afterwards, I edit one of the test methods of that class and save
the editor. Exactly now I'd really like to rerun that test method by selecting
it in the JUnit view, but it had been cleared in the meantime.

Jörg, the view gets cleared when the launch config gets removed from the debug
view. If you have automatic removal enabled
(Preferences->Run/Debub->Launching->Remove terminated ...) this might happen to
often.

OK I see now that this is the reason. But then *why* is the view cleared in the
first place when the launch is removed from the Debug view? Clearing the Debug
view is good, as otherwise it accumulates all terminated launches over time. But
the JUnit view only shows one launch and it doesn't get cluttered over time. I'd
think it is better to always show the last run there than show nothing?


This has been improved for 3.2. There's now a JUnit history that keeps previous launches.
