Another issue is that some mnemonics are used twice. For example 'c' is used 
for the "Change" text font and for the Colors page. So pressing c on the first 
page always activates the Color page. 

Aditionally "Matching bracket highlight color ..." should be disabled when 
Hightlight matching bracket is disabled.
