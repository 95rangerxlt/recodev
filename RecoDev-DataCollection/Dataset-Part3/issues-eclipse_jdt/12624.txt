Build 20020328

The convention on our team is to have no indent at all for methods (since we use 
the method level editor, that indent is a waste of space).  This doesn't play 
well with refactoring, which assumes all methods are indented by one tab.  Here 
is an example method that was inserted using Refactor->Pull up:

	protected Button createButton(Composite parent, String label) {
	Button button = new Button(parent, SWT.PUSH);
	button.setText(Policy.bind(label));
	GridData data = new GridData(GridData.FILL_HORIZONTAL);
	...
	return button;
}

the problem lies in the usage of MemberEdit class
it want lines passes as parameter, not source elements (methods etc.)
not sure if easily fixable for 2.0


P3 - rare case not to have your methods indented
deferred
will have a look - it's probably fixed now
works fine in 2.1
