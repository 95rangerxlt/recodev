When using the 'Open Type' dialog in VisualAge for Java, you can type a few
letters of the class name, and then use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to quickly select
the desired type from the list.  In Eclipse, you are required to hit the TAB key
or use the mouse to move the focus to the list of types. 

Since a large number of Eclipse users are likely current/former VAJ users (who
would likely consider this a bug), it would be nice if the Eclipse behavior
could be changed to match VAJ.

Martin you were correct on this one <g>
best effort fix in 20011114.
The latest catchup introduced some new behaviour on Linux. The focus is stolen 
and cursor down navigates between buttons. On Windows, this does not happen.

This seems to have been fixed. Works in 20020115-I on linux.
