markers are preserved except when they fall into the extracted code. This is a 
limitation we accept for 2.0
There are plans to embed task into the source code. If so they are preserved 
during refactoring. Without that feature there isn't much that refactoring can 
do for 2.1 since this would envolve more support from core and text.
Chaning state from assigned later to resolved later. Assigned later got 
introduced by the last bug conversion and is not a supported Eclipse bug state.
Reopening.
Task are now embedded in code.
