The new delete action should more behave like the old action. This means:

- don't save after deleting members from the CU. Class TextFileChange offers a 
  method setSave to control save behaviour. Surround With doesn't save either.

- the dialog should have the question icon in the page. The image can be
  accessed via JFaceResources.getImageRegistry().get(Dialog.DLG_IMG_INFO).

- we shouldn't show the preview button in the refactoring dialog.

- we shouldn't report progress if we delete a member from  a CU.

- there should be normal Edit->Undo when deleting a member from a CU.

Adam, 

we should improve this for the milestone build. I added code to disable the 
preview button and I will look into the progress monitor stuff as well.
Fixed the progress monitor problem as well. Now honoring the already present 
flag Wizard.needsProgressMonitor(); But this isn't dynamic (evaluated when 
creating the layout). Need to check if we need a dynamic behaviour as well. 
Adam, what do you think ?

surround with has it very easy because it works on 1 file and that file must be 
open. delete works on any number of files, which do not have to be open
