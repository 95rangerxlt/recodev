1) In the following code execute code assist at "|":
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector|<String> v= new Vector<String>();
    }

2) select java.util.Vector (with the intent to add 
the import statement). You get the following completion:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector<E><String> v= new Vector<String>();
    }

This is highly annoying since now you can no longer add
an import statement by just using code assist.
