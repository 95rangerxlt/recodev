Same problem in RC2.
True, and it will very likely stay in 3.1
Might be related to bug 50139.
Still broken in 3.2M6.

This bug involves inlining an instance method.  Bug 50139 regards inlining a static method.
Smaller test case:

public class Bug {
	
	class Inner {
		String field;
	}
	
	Inner inner;
	String string;
	
	static void foo() {
		Bug b= new Bug();
		b.bar();
	}
	
	void bar() {
		inner.field= "Eclipse";
		string= "Eclipse";
	}
}
Fixed for RC1.
