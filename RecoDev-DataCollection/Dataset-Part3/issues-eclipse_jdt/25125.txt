- It misses Javadoc comments for method, type and file (as configured on the 
code manipulation preference page)
- The created imports are not ordered according to the 'organize import' 
preference page.
- There is no line delimiter between the methods

You can use StubUtil.genStub to create method stubs.

will try running organize imports and format on a fake working copy
simply use the importsstucture to collect all imports and do a 'create' in the 
end.
yeah, the thing is to use ImportStructure i need an ICompilationUnit, which i do
not at the moment
so i need a fake working copy
ImportStructure is not useful here - it tries to reach for the file of the
working copy
which does not exist so the whole thing is not possible

please make it possible or comment on how i could workaround this limitation
ok, will have a look at it.
fixed > 20030211

ImportsStructure now also works on not created CU's

added test 
not fixed yet
now i need to do my part :)
P2, because it's a 'should fix'
fixed this and the nls refactoring
this covers all cases where i create new java files
