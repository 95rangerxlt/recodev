A bug was introduced during refactoring, such that deleted files are no longer successfully reported via BuildContext.reportDeletedGeneratedFiles.  The problem is that the return of GeneratedFileManager.deleteObsoleteFilesAfterBuild() is being ignored, rather than added to its caller's list of files to report.

This actually has no consequence at present, due to bug 163733.  But when that bug is fixed, this bug will be the next thing in the way.

Deleted files are now reported to the BuildContext.
