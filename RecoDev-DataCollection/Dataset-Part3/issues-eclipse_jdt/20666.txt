The Export Javadoc wizard should examine the jdk1.3/jdk1.4 compliance for a
project and add the appropriate javadoc switch by default to the javadoc args
viewer.

Result of not fixing: Javadoc users will get errors in the console complaining
about all their assert statements, and then have to figure out the switches to
add to correct this problem.

Moving to JDT/UI for comment.
This is indeed inconvenient. We will doc this issue. Workaround is that the 
user stores their options as an Ant script. 

Assign Martin to make sure that this is doced.
Please mark LATER when doced.
