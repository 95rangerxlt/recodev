Build Identifier: 20100617-1415 (final Helios Release)

This is a strange one:
I have streched my Eclipse window over two Monitors (Win7 extended desktop), so that the right monitor has the editors and the console, and Package Explorer and all the small windows are cluttered on the left monitor.

I have checked the option "Expand vertical ruler icons upon hovering" in the Java/Editor/Hovers Preferences, so that multiple markers on the vertical ruler on the left of the Java editor are expanded. 

The expanded hover is placed just above the mouse cursor instead of under it and when I try to move the mouse into it, e.g. to navigate to a overridden method or toggle a breakpoint, the hover closes (see attached screenshot in Editor.png, the mouse cursor is on the breakpoint on the ruler next to line 18). The correct behavior is shown in attached screenshot Editor2.png.

This happens ONLY (as it was in my case), if the left-most pixel of the editor is on the (edge of) left monitor, and the ruler is on the right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Java class from the following snippet:
public class MultiHoverTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Runnable r = new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println("Hello world!");
			}
		};
		r.run();
	}
}

2. Place a breakpoint on declaration of run() method, so that there are two icons on the ruler: breakpoint and Implementation of interface marker.

3. check the option "Expand vertical ruler icons upon hovering" in the Java/Editor/Hovers Preferences (see attached prefs.png)

4. Move the Eclipse window so that it is placed over two monitors (does not need to streched over the whole screen), so that the left editor border is on the left monitor and the ruler on the right (might need to play a little bit with placement, a single pixel may count!)

5. Move mouse to ruler, so that the hover is expanded to show both breakpoint and implementation marker.


Workaround: simply move the editor part one or two pixels to either side.

Fixed in HEAD of AnnotationBarHoverManager#computeInformationControlLocation(..).

The hover manager code tries to ensure that the complete hover is visible, is only on 1 monitor and does not overlap the subject area. That's why it jumped to the top. For the expansion hover, this doesn't make sense.
That was fast! Especially for such a minor bug with a (simple) workaround.

I'll test it, when 3.7M1 is released.

Thanks!
