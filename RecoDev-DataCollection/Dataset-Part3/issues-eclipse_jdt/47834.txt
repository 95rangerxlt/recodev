Revitalize Java perspective.

- current prespective is old fashion 
- revitalize (fast views per default > ask Platform/UI)
- add new views (declaration, ....) 
- (remove problems view) ?
- problems view already gone,
- added Declarations and Javadoc views to our three perspectives,
- decided not to have a package explorer as a Fastview because that would confuse new users.
