Nick where there are changes related to customizable key bindings that jdt-ui 
should adapt to?


Action definitions now need a name, and optionally an icon and description, in 
order to be used in the key bindings customization UI, which made it into 
yesterday's build.  See the plugin.xml for org.eclipse.ui for examples.

Chris, please let Erich know what other changes need to made for JDT.

Dirk can you please take care of the refactoring actions and then pass it on to 
Kai for editor actions if needed.
I added the name and description attribute to all Navigate, Source, Refactoring 
and some Edit actions. Still missing is search and the rest of the edit actions.

Besides adding the attributes I removed the short cut from the propertiy files 
for those actions.

Moving to Daniel Megert to handle Search actions.
Added name and description for Search action definitions and removed short cuts
from property files.

Fixed edit action defintions for JDT Text.

Compare also needs to be updated
Closing.
