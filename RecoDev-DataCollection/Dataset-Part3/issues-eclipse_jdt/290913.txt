Build Identifier: 

When creating a new TestSuite using the Wizard the generated suite-method creates a TestSuite with a fixed name:

TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("Test for fullyqualified.package.name");

It would be a nice feature when the testsuite were created by using the package name obtained through reflection:

TestSuite suite =  new TestSuite("Test for " + AllTests.class.getPackage().getName());

This way its junit-label is also changed when the suite is moved to another package.

Reproducible: Always

Fixed in HEAD of NewTestSuiteWizardPage.

The suite name is now e.g. "AllTests.class.getName()" for suite name "AllTests".
