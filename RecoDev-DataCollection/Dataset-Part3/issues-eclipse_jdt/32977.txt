RC1

- given a class C with a static field FOO
- enter code that accesses FOO via an instance of C:
    C c;
    int i= c.FOO,
- open QF
Observe: one QF is called "Change access to 'C' (declaring type)". This is hard to 
understand because it doesn't match the original warning "The static field C.FOO should 
be accessed in a static way"
I suggest to change the QF's name to something like: "make access to C.FOO static".

Changed to:
Change access to static using ''{0}'' (instance type)
Change access to static using ''{0}'' (declaring type)
