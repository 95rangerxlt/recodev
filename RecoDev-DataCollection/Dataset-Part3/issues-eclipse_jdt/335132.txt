Build Identifier: 20100917-0705

The size and position of "override/implement method" dialog box is not saved.

If I make the dialog larger to see more methods at once (I have a large monitor), then on subsequent invocations the dialog resets to default size / position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up override/implement method dialog.
2. Resize the dialog, e.g. make it larger.
3. Finish by overriding a method (clicking "Ok)
4. Bring up the dialog again.

---> The dialog has the old, default size - its size and position are not saved.

Raksha, please add this for all SourceActionDialogs (separately for each dialog). See SuperInterfaceSelectionDialog#getDialogBoundsSettings().
