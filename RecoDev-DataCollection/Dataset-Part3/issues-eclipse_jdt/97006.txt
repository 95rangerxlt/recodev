Steps to reproduce:
- Switch to workingset mode
- Create several working sets
- Rearrange them
- Switch to project mode
- Close package explorer
- Reopen package explorer
- Switch to workingset mode

-> The working set dialog lost the order of the workingsets
-> The order should be persisted either in the specialized Java workingset 
dialog or in the package explorer itself
