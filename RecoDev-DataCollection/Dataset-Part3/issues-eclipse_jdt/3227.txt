When implementing some JCL, define first java.lang.Object (empty body), this will issue a compilation error: 'missing java.lang.Throwable'.
Then, add java.lang.Throwable. The latter will get a problem 'missing java.lang.RuntimeException', and the first unit (Object) still has the same problem 'missing Throwable'.

Rebuild all: both units are complaining about 'missing RuntimeException'.
