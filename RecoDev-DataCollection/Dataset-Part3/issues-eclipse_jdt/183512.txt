In the following code (single source file):

public class X {
	public static void method() {
	}
}

class Y extends X {
	public static void method() {
	}
}

place the cursor after 'X' in the declaration of class Y.  Mark occurrences will highlight the nearest X but will also highlight Y.method() on the next line.  It does not highlight the declaration of class X (also the case when there are no class bodies).
