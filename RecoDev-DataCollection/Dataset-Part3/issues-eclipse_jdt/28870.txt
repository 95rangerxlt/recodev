This is yet another example why it's not a good idea for the braces to 
automatically enclose subsequent code. Do you really want to chase down every 
possible combination and tailor the behavior to it? Wouldn't it be simpler to 
adopt the model that no existing text is ever put between the opening and 
generated closing brace?
The same happens when using array literals as parameters. It's *very* 
inconvenient, especially when working in "Show Source of Selected Element Only" 
mode.
Fixed a while ago.
