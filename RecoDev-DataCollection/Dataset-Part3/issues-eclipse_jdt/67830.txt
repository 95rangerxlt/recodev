1) enable watch/edit for CVS
2) check out some project
3) open a java editor
4) ctrl-shift-F to format the editor contents
5) observe: you get a dialog asking you to validate the edit
6) cancel the dialog
7) press ctrl-shift-F again
8) observe: nothing happens

9) repeate steps 1-7 with ctrl-shift-O (organize imports) instead of format
10) observe: you get another dialog asking to validate the edit again.

From a user perspective, there is absolutely no reason why "Organize Imports"
should work while "Format" doesn't.

My expectation would be that editors try to validate the edit everytime I'm
trying to change the editor contents.

The actions that no longer work (are disabled) are those that set their
read-only state after validateEdit. The other actions are always enabled. Those
should also be disabled.

Fixed in HEAD.
