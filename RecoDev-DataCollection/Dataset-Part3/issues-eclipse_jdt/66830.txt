Eclipse:  200405211200

While attempting to reproduce bug 66796, I stumbled on the following:

Created a class with the following code:

    package com.newco.milter.internal;

    import java.util.Map;
    import java.util.TreeMap;

    public class SomeFile
    {
        /**
         * <p>Some member.</p>
         */
        private Map[] someMap = new TreeMap[10];
    }

And pasted in the following when the cursor is on the end "}" (the imports must 
be folded at this point):

    public void doStuff()
    {
        final List list = new LinkedList();
        list.add(new HashMap());
    }

Then I did an "organize imports".

Important aspects:

o  There must be more than one import
o  The imports must start folded

I will attempt to reproduce with RC2 in the near future.

(Screenshot and configuration to be attached)

There were no stack traces associated with this.
I cannot reproduce this in 200406111814 (3.0RC2).

I will leave open for the next week to see if I can reproduce in another way.

(Great work on the RC's!)
this has been fixed in for 3.0 RC2
