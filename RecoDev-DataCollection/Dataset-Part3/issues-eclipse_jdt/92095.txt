I find that the type filters preference is a very handy feature and useful for
cutting down on the size of files in the open types dialog, as well as duplicates.  

But I find this feature hard to discover under the "Appearance" preferences, it
seems like the preference page should not be under appearance.

Also it would be really nice to have a hook from the open types dialog to set
this feature (i.e. select an item in the open types dialog and choose "Ignore
all members in package "javax.blah.blah" or some such support).

I think the preference page is at the right spot, but we should add a link from the Open Type dialog's view menu (where also working set filters can be configured).

The context menu is not under our control, and it would be a bit inconsistent to have a type filters action there, but not something for working sets. Furthermore, the context menu action would also have to be added to content assist and the organize imports dialog then.
Fixed in HEAD. Added "TypeFilters..." action to the dialog's "view" menu.
