change '1' to 'true'
use quick fix to change method type

We could provide a preference as the editor does: apply single proposals 
automatically.

Pressing Esc should clearly take the user back to the original position.
No way, I don't think that makes no sense. You have to read what the quick fix is.
I wanted to write:
I think this makes no sense. The quick fix suggestions are not good enough to

the fact is: it requires more clicks now than before.
ups, sorry, I read your PR wrong. I though you said that on CTRL+1 if there is
only one proposal I should take it directly.

What you say makes sense. Note that you don't have to make a selection, pressing
tab is enough.
