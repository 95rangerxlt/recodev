using ${type} in toarray is wrong
it puts the name of the enclosing type - which is very much not what is needed.
only the user knows to what type the casting should be done

suggest creating ${enclosing_type} for enclosing types

workaround is to change the template definition to:
(${atype}[]) ${collection}.toArray(new ${atype}[${collection}.size()]);

suspect that other templates may be affected by this bug as well

Changed enclosing java element names to enclosing_* as suggested. Default 
templates did not change.
