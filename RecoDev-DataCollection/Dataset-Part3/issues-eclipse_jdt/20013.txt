Confirmed that mnemonic is missing in 20020610 without translations.
Could use "Add Ta&sks", however this will require JDT to change "Expand 
&Selection to" to "E&xpand Selection to".

Released change for mnemonic in the messages.properties for 
org.eclipse.ui.internal.
Kai and Dani, could you please review the change.

Moving to JDT UI for the change to E&xpand Selection to.
