Code assist should insert angular brackets when completing a generic type in an
1.5 project. E.g. when I type ...
  new ArrayLi/*Ctrl+Space*/
..., the completion should be (in linked mode) ...
  new ArrayList</*Selected_type_proposal*/>/*Linked_mode_exit_position*/
..., just like when completing a method call.

We have to check whether that's already feasible with the new
CompletionRequestor infrastructure.

fixed for M6 (angular brackets) / M7 (type argument guessing)
