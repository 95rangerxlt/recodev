In RC2, I get a copy/paste failure in the following specific and rare situation:

1) I have a java file in a java project
2) I have the file open in a Java editor and it is dirty
3) I tried to copy and past the file to a non-java project

I got an error stating that the operation couldn't be performed because the file
is unsaved. I would expect instead to be prompted to save the file before
proceeding. 

Also, if I perform the above but in step 3 chose a java package, the paste takes
place without a prompt to save the dirty editor.

Not critical for 3.0
In I20070710-1416 move always asks to save and copy never asks to save (and does not copy the file buffer content but the file content)
