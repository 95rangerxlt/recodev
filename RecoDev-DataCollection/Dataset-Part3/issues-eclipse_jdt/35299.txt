When renaming a java-template in RC2 a message dialog is shown. It says: 'The 
name of the template has changed.' That's right but the dialog has Yes/No 
buttons. If you hit yes a new template is created according to the changes if 
you hit no the old one is changed. I think the message is misleading and should 
be a question or something.

It's not a major bug but I was a bit confused so it should change ;)

Moving to JDT/UI for comment.
Agreed the message should be replace/create

not critical enough for 2.1

fixed some time ago.
