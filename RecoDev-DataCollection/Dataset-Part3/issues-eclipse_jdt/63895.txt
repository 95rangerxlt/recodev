Given the following code:

public class ShortestPathRouter {

/**
 * A stack of Paths.
 */
<<CARET>>static class PathStack extends ArrayList {

	Path pop() {
		return (Path)remove(size()-1);
	}
	
	void push(Path path) {
		add(path);
	}

}

When the string "private " is pasted at the CARET location, it is incorrectly 
indented.
