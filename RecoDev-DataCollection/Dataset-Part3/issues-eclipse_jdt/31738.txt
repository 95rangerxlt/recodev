Open the properties for a project, then Java Build Path -> Libraries.  Select a
variable from the list and select Edit, then Variable.  Select Edit again to
edit the variable's path.  Edit the path then select OK; when it asks to do a
full rebuild select No.  When you get back to the "Edit Variable Entry" dialog,
it now gives the bogus error "Classpath entry already exists", which is true
since that's how you got to the dialog in the first place.  Now select Cancel
(which is your only choice given the bogus error).  The changed path for the
variable will not be reflected in the list of libraries (until you close and
reopen the project properties dialog).

Martin, can you please comment.
Agree that dialog needs improvement, but not critical for 2.1
