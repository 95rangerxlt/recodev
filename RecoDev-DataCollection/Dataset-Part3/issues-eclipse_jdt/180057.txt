We would like to move to consuming junit 3.8.2 from Orbit in our build. I'll attach a patch for the jdtui and orbit map files to make this change.  I didn't know if you wanted to make the change. If not, I would be happy to make it and then run a test build.  In any case, I thought I would let you know.

All the Eclipse project bundles that are planned on being consumed from Orbit are listed in bug 177045.

According to DJ, the junit4 bundle in Orbit is not yet in the correct shape but he is working on it.
