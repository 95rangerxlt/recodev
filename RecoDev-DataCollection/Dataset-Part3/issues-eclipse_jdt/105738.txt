Mark Occurrences sometimes highlights random text while I am typing in a 
javadoc comment.  I will attach a GIF image for an example.  In this example, I 
was typing on the second line of the comment (the line ending in "thi"), and 
the highlights suddenly appeared.  I cannot come up with any rationale for the 
areas that are highlighted; in particular, I had only changed a couple lines in 
this file, so it's not like it's highlighting tokens in a slightly out-of-date 
version of the file.  Note that the highlights include whitespace, 

It is not reproducible, not even immediately after it happens.  That is, if I 
am typing along and the random highlights suddenly appear, and I delete and 
then re-enter a few characters, they will not reappear.  I have not been able 
to figure out a reliable repro case, but I'm not the only person on my team 
that is affected by this.  Will add info if more becomes available.

Screenshot showing random highlights
Please provide more details, see:

It also happens to me.
I'm trying to create a pattern of occurrences, but still can't figure out what is wrong.

Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20051215-1506
WTP 1.0
Just adding info as per request.  Still happening in 3.3 (build I20061003-0800).  Happens quite commonly as I'm editing javadoc, but still with no pattern that I can discern, and never when I'm trying to make it happen :-(

VM is 1.5.0_07.  No plugins other than those that came with Eclipse SDK are installed.  There are no relevant errors in the log.

My machine is a Dell with two hyperthreaded Xeon processors, so it appears to the OS (WinXP SP2) as a four-processor machine.  Video is "NVIDIA Quadro NVS with AGP8X".
Walter, you added this to the polish list. I can't do anything until I can reproduice myself. Sorry.
It has been reported here by at least three people.  The bug badly impairs an otherwise very useful feature, during normal development usage, so it seems like something that is worth "polish" attention.  My hope was that maybe if some attention was directed to the bug we could make some progress on it.  Even you can't reproduce it locally, perhaps it is worth some dev time to either consider what the possible causes might be, or consider whether there is logging or tracing code that could be added to help track it down.

Are you guys using dual-processor machines?  I strongly suspect this is a threading issue, so it might not ever appear on single-processor machines.
I tried on our Linux box which is a real 2 processor machine. If you can provide steps that are closer to a reproducible case I can give it a try again.
I'll spend some time today trying to come up with a better repro.  Maybe if I try hard enough that will scare the bug out of existence :-)
It still happens to me, but, as Walter Harley said on comment #4, I am unable to define a pattern of occurrences.  But still, this is a very common bug.

Another screenshot

Here's another screenshot showing a defective highlight.  This one is in a file that contains no javadoc at all (it's source code for a compiler test case).  The highlight extended itself for as long as I typed, but when I moved focus away from the editor to another application and then back, the problem disappeared.

I'm not sure what action I performed when the bad highlighting started - I've gotten so used to it happening that it doesn't register at first.  Still no evident pattern to what causes it.
Get rid of deprecated state.
.
We finally have a test case.
*** Bug 115553 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
*** Bug 209766 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Given:
{
  int variable= 10;
}

1. select variable
2. type 'i', wait, then type 'nteger'
3. move cursor down <-- important: move it to a place without Java element
Is:
 i is orange rest is not updated, ever

I've committed a fix but we have to see whether it removes the occurrence marks too eagerly.
