The Properties... action appears in the context menu of library containers (JRE System Library, Plug-in Dependencies) and logical packages, but it always results in a dialog saying 'No property pages for xxx.'.

In 3.2, the action was not in the context menu, but File > Properties... and Alt+Enter opened the same dialog. We should at least remove the action from the context menu again -- better yet would be to have the command disabled when no property pages are available.

According to bug 43068, the Properties... action should always be part of the context menu (like Cut/Copy...).
But the action should be disabled if no property page is available. I guess this is too expensive to do.

Moving to platform that implements the PropertyDialogAction


*** Bug 165447 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
We have no plans to work on this currently but would be happy to look at a patch
Fixed in HEAD: I agree on stable main menus but the context menu should be more accurate like we do it for the refactoring and search entries.
