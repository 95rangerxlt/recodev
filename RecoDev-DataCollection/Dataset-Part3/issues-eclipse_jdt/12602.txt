I am using build 20020321.

Do the following:
1. File -> Export -> Javadoc
2. then click on "next".
At this point the "finish" button should be enabled.
3. Now click the "Style Sheet" checkbox two times.
4. The "finish" button is disabled now and no way to enable it again (except 
perhaps chosing a valid style sheet).

Clicking on "Overview" twice should do the same...
