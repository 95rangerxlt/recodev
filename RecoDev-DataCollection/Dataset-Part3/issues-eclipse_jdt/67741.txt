Hi there,

the junit source jar is missing from the junit plugin, even though the preffs are set to default to point to 
there for the junit source.

This got addressed for RC2. The source are located in the JDT source plugin 
and JDT detects them automatically.
Hmm, I did test this on RC2 on Mac OS X - there it wasn't in the junit-plugin.

Or do you mean that it should be at a different location that the preconfigured path eclipse sets when 
you create a new junit-test (the first in a project) is wrong?

The source is under plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.source_3.0.0\src\org.junit_3.8.1 
and should be detected when you add JUnit as a plugin or add JUnit to the 
build path quick fix.
Strange, yesterday it didn't, but today it works as advertised.

:( Sorry for the spam and thanks for the clarification.
