Here's a snippet of code that I have in my editor:

new Text(null, 0).addControlListener(TYPE+HERE);

if I type new 'ControlListener' and auto complete, M5 seems to provide a nice stub, however it also introduces a compile error when it removes the closing brackets at the end of the statement:

new Text(null, 0).addControlListener(new ControlListener(){
        
    public void controlResized(ControlEvent e) {
    }
        
    public void controlMoved(ControlEvent e) {
    }
}; <<--- SHOULD BE A CLOSING PAREN HERE

Probably introduced by new constructor proposal work.
