Patch to create necessary imports in affected compilation units

Due to problems I'm having with CVS and creating patches for JDT-UI at
top-level, this is a single-file patch for IntroduceFactoryRefactoring.java.

JUnit plug-in test for import generation
Robert, I can't apply the patches since they don't work against HEAD nor 
against a version containing the patch in 46951. I released the patch in 
46951. Can you please regenerate the patches for this bug. Thanks.

Updated patch that works with HEAD of 1/5/2004

This patch, unlike the previous version, should work with source that already
has the patch for bug #46951 applied to it. I believe the JUnit test patch
already submitted works fine with HEAD of 1/5/2004, and therefore doesn't
require an update.
Bob, the patch still doesn't work. I have version 1.7 of 
IntroduceFactoryRefactoring in the workspace.

Replacement patch with whitespace fixed to apply cleanly

There was some bogus whitespace in the original patch. You could just select
"ignored white-space", or use this replacement patch. Either way, it will apply
cleanly against version 1.7 of IntroduceFactoryRefactoring.java.
Patch released to HEAD.
