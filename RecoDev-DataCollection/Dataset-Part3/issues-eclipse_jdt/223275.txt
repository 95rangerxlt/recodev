patch to AbstractInformation control

This patch is needed in order to consult the new getPersistLocation() method on
whether to set location.  It also uses a new PopupDialog constructor to get the desired behavior of persisting size by default, but not location.
Thanks for the patch. In order to make it work I had to improve the PopupDialog.
Fixed in HEAD.
