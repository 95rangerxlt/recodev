It's really nice that we do the normal Java syntax highlighting when browsing revisions, but this sets 
up a trap that I just can't seem to get enough of. :-)

It seems like everytime I start browsing file revisions, I end up getting burned by the same mistake - 
I try to perform normal Java editor actions (F3, F4, editing, etc.) in a "revision editor" and it always 
takes me a while to figure out why nothing works.

The situation ("Hey, genious! You're looking at a revision!") should be more prominent somehow. A 
different background color, a dialog that pops up when I try to perform unsupported actions, etc.

Any such support would need to be provided by JDT since they contribute the 
viewer that is used in the revision editor. Moving to JDT for comment.
We don't know anything about revisions. The title (in editor tab) already shows
an indication (rev. number) and there's the read-only status in the status line.

We could offer to set the bg color for read-only editor input. Would that solve
your problem?
Or, more generally, we could somehow indicate that the displayed Java source is
not on the build path and therefore all the Java model operations won't work.

This is not just true for revision editors, but also for external Java files or
non-referenced (but still remaining on the search path) libraries.

Well, one plan item is to improve that ;-)
Setting the editor background color to something different would be a big help.
Currently no plans to change that.
Get rid of deprecated state.
Fixed long time ago: there's a different icon and as bonus several actions like F3 now work in the revision Java editor.
