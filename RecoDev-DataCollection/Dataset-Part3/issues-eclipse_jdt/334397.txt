patch for R3_4_maintenance

The fix is the same implementation of org.eclipse.jdt.ui.jarpackager.JarPackageData#getAbsoluteJarLocation() as in HEAD and in R3_5_2, but without the whitespace changes in the whole file.

Re-tested all scenarios from bug 239695, bug 281867, and bug 296931.

org.eclipse.jdt.ui is already at version 3.4.3, so no need to bump.
Dani, please review (and release if you want).
Patch is good.
