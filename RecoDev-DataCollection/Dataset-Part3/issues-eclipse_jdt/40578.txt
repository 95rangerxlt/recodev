When adding a container to the build path of a project, the container will often
not appear in the Package Explorer.

We first observed this bug in the containers for WSDD technology libraries, but
managed to reproduce it in a trivial container class that resolved to a single
hardcoded classpath entry (our container type was called "Test Container" --
implementation attached).

Steps to reproduce:
- Start with freshly opened copy of Eclipse with an empty workspace. 
- Create a new java project called "asdf" (File -> new -> java project -> Next
-> enter "asdf" -> Click finish before advancing to the last page)
- Expand the project in the Package Explorer by clicking +
- Edit the build path (right-click -> properties -> java build path -> Libraries)
- Add a container (Add Library -> Test Container (or some other custom
container) -> Next -> Finish)
- At this point, the container is correctly added in the build path dialog
- Click "okay"
- Notice that the new container does not appear in the Package Explorer.


I believe this may have something to do with the Java model not being correctly
notified that the container has been added. Here are some observations:
1. Even though the package explorer does not show the library, it does
exist in the .classpath file.
2. This only occurs the first time I create a project in my workspace. If I
create a second identical project, the missing library reappears in both
projects.
3. I've verified that the container resolves correctly and contains at least 1
classpath entry.
4. Once I've created a project that demonstrates the bug, restarting Eclipse
will "fix" the project. The missing library will reappear after restarting.
5. The problem only occurs when adding the library through the build path
property page. The problem does not occur when adding the library in the New
Project wizard.
6. Refreshing the project does not fix the problem.
7. Certain GUI actions (like advancing to the last page of the New Java Project
wizard) will "fix" the problem. Once the problem has been fixed, it is hard to
reproduce without deleting the projects in the workspace and restarting Eclipse.
8. We have not yet been able to reproduce this error using the JRE System
Library container.

Plugin project containing a simple container class that demonstrates the bug

This is the source for a plugin that provides a trivial classpath container, a
container properties page, and a container initializer. Load this project into
your workspace and you should be able to demonstrate the bug in an inner
workspace.
Edited Container.getClasspathEntries() to point to "d:/jdk1.3.1/lib/tools.jar" 
(so that it exists in my setup).

When following the given steps, the Java element delta being fired looks ok:
Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN}
	asdf[*]: {CHILDREN}
		D:/jdk1.3.1/lib/tools.jar[+]: {}
		ResourceDelta(/asdf/.classpath)[*]

However the Package Explorer view is not reacting to this delta.

Moving to JDT/UI.


*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 38513 ***
reopen, the delta includes a change to a package fragment root

Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN}
	asdf[*]: {CHILDREN}
		D:/jdk1.3.1/lib/tools.jar[+]: {}

should be fixed by the new F_CLASSPATH_CHANGED notification
