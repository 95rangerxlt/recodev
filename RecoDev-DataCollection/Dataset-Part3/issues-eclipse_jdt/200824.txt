Given:
package test;
public class E01 {
        public void foo() {
             L|
        }
}

1. Add template 'List' with pattern:

List ${list:newName(java.util.List)}= ${word_selection};
ArrayList ${arrayList:newName(java.util.ArrayList)};

to javacontext

2. Replace '|' with caret
3. Ctrl-Space, Ctrl-Space
4. type 'ist'
5. Enter
Is:
List list= ;
ArrayList arrayList;ist
Should:
List list= ;
ArrayList arrayList;

fix

The insertion offset must be shifted as well when adding the imports (or anything else).
fixed > I20070821-0800
There are two TemplateProposal classes. Please provide a patch for the other one as well.

Thanks.

syncronize

Ok, but I need two steps to fix this. This patch does change the two implementations only in there structure such that 'Compare with each other' shows the relevant differences between the two implementations. Once released we can go to the next step and maybe even try to merge the two implementations.

This patch reveals some interesting differences:
1. The jface implementation does not do a beginCompoundChange/endCompoundChange, why?
2. The jdt implementation does not ensurePositionCategoryRemoved in some cases, maybe a leak?
Looks good - committed to HEAD.

>beginCompoundChange/endCompoundChange, why?
Tom added it in JDT but forgot to push it down (like the above thing)

>2. The jdt implementation does not ensurePositionCategoryRemoved in some cases,
>maybe a leak?
Looks like a bug to me.

We should
- implement ICompletionProposalExtension4 in JFace Text's proposal
- be able to get rid of copied code like JDT's PositionBasedCompletionProposal,
  InclusivePositionUpdater etc.

I suggest we mark this bug fixed and open a new one for the sync work.

Still have to push down jdts fix for this bug to platform...
Fixed in HEAD.
