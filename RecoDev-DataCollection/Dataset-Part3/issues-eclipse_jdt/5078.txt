I have noticed two problems in the JDT packages view of build 204:

fixed in 205
Build 20011219:

When doing the following steps using the packages view:
1. create a new package
2. move existing classes from an existing package into that new
   package

The moved classes appear still in the old package, and the new package 
is shown to have an error.

The Navigator View displays the moved classes perfectly allright in
the new package. On disk they are in the new package and perfectly
moved and the package statement and all references to the moved
classes changed properly.

Refresh nor rebuild helps. The only way that worked was to restart eclipse.
The is fixed in build > 20011219
