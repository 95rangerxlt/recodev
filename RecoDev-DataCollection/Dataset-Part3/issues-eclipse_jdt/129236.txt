If I hover over a class to get its javadoc hover, and hit F2 to give it focus, the focused javadoc window is blank.

Looks like a problem with the Browser widget
- do you see the Javadoc when using the Javadoc view?
- anything in .log?

AndrÃ©, do you also see this?
Andre, your feedback is required here.
Moving to text
Yes, I see this too.
Javadoc view works fine.
Nothing in .log
Javadoc view works fine.

We added some code to disable links in the hover. When the location changes to anything but "about:blank", we don't allow the location change. On the GTK platform, "about:blank" is opened when the Browser::setText() method is called. This may be mozilla-specific.
Andre, can we have a look at this on your mac?
This is a problem with the LocationListener in BrowserInformationControl:
it does not handle any URLs other than "about:blank".
On Mac URLs starting with "applewebdata:" must be processed as well.
The following patch fixes that problem.
Created attachment 35395
patch for org.eclipse.jdt.ui
Created attachment 35396
correct patch for org.eclipse.jdt.ui

Forgot to remove a println...
Filed bug 130314 against SWT about the special location changes when using the setText method.

Released the patch for now. Revisit this when bug 130314 gets fixed.
