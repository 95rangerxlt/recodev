Why don't we have a native library attribute for class path containers ?
Dirk, what is the advantage of that? The entries inside the container can have
such attributes.

Darin, which entries can have a classpath attribte? I assumed all entries of
kind CPE_LIBRARY.
The launching code looks for native classpath attributes on all types of 
classpath entries.
IMO this would make it consistent with access rules. Most of the time I am not
interested in single Jars when I am dealing with containers. However, not
important for 3.1.
To add this for containers is a easy (1 line) change. For projects and source
folders its a bit more, but just copy/paste.

Darin, last chance to speak up if you're not happy with the current support:
Limitations:
- only on libraries
- only one entry
- no variables

Fine with me.
