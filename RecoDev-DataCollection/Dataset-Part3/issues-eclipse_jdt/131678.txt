When editing a java file and you insert a line break into a multiline comment, the new will also be a comment.
  /* one */
-->
  /* one
   * two */


Some like that could also be in the properties editor. When inserting a line break into a comment line, the new line should also be a comment
  # one X two
-->
  # one
  # two
instead of
  # one
  two

I just tested it with java comments:

/** ... */  will add new comment lines
/* ... */   dito
// ....     will produce a new non-comment line


So this request could also improve the java editor. I dont know if it should be a new request....
Whileit is a good idea (and already works like that in the Java editor) to continue exisiting comments in the following cases:

/* This is a traditional style comment
 * <enter here>
 */

/**
 * This is a Javadoc comment
 * <enter here>
 */

# this is a properties file comment
# <enter here>

We don't plan to do it in the following cases:
/*
 */<enter here>

/**
 *
 */<enter here>

// Single line comment <enter here>


Note: Java editor and Properties editor are different components and need different bugs.
Ok, thanks. I opened bug 131741 for extending the java editor.
