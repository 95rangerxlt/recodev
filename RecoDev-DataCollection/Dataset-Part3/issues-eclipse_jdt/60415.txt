We should remove the search extension page and should make sure that 
participants can't damage a search. If a participant generates an exception 
the participant should be disabled for the rest of the Eclipse sessions. This 
is consistent with Platform/UI and refactoring.

Removed the UI on friday (don't know what happened to my comment on this bug).
Part 2 of the fix is the protection code.
