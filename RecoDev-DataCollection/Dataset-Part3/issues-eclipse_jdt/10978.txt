It would be very nice if it was possible to set a preference for JUnit to open 
in a specified perspective. I now try to do this manually, by having a 
perspective that I've named JUnit, having turned off the functionality to 
switch to debug perspective on run/debug, and trying to remember to switch to 
the JUnit perspective before launching JUnit. 

The last part is troublesome, however, as I tend to forget about switching 
perspectives. Or, if I have a class selected in the Navigator in my Java 
perspective, that I want to run with JUnit. In that case, I have to find that 
class in the JUnit perspective first, before running it, which takes some 
manual work regardless of how I do it.

with the new launch configuration mechanism (JUnit support shows up in the next 
integration build) you can specify the target perspective (see the Common Tab 
item)
