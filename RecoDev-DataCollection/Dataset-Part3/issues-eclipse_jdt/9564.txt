not critical, but I'm interested whether we provide enough APIs to enable this.
fixed:
If it finds a superclass with setUp() and tearDown() already defined, it will 
add the comment
/*
 * @see SuperClassName#setUp()
 */

and
/*
 * @see SuperClassName#tearDown()
 */


where SuperClassName will usually be "TestCase".

Else, it will add a default javadoc comment which I copied from TestCase.
does it honor the preference settings from 'Code generation'?
it should
It does when producing
/*
 * @see SuperClassName#setUp()
 */
and
/*
 * @see SuperClassName#tearDown()
 */

When I create my own JavaDoc, I use the format in 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.codemanipulation.StubUtility.genJavaDocStub(..)
