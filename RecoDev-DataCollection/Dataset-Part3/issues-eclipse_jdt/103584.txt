Need to provide a way to support variables in -A options. Most urgent need is
for project-relative paths, but will need to eventually provide support for
variables like %WEBLOGIC_HOME%.

We now attempt variable substitution on all strings added to the processor 
environment.  Variables must be delimited on both sides by %, and must be the 
first segment of a path.

So, if FOO is a classpath variable that points to d:/foo, then %FOO%/bar.txt 
will resolve to d:/foo/bar.txt.  Classpath resolution depends on the existence 
of the classpath variable; if it doesn't exist, the raw string will be added to 
the environment options.  However, bar.txt (in this example) does not need to 
exist.

The reserved variable ROOT is given special meaning: it is the workspace root, 
and introduces a project resource.  So, for instance, if quux is the name of a 
project, then %ROOT%/quux will resolve to the absolute path of quux and %
ROOT%/.classpath will resolve to the absolute path to quux/.classpath.  When 
using ROOT, the first segment of the path must actually exist: in the example, 
quux must exist, but .classpath need not.
