Eclipse 3.0 M7

I'm really not that fond of the new tree view for search results (too much
digging to see anything useful) so I disable it. Unfortunatly this disabling
doesn't persist and I have to redisable it every time I restart Eclipse or
simply close the "Search" or "New Search" view. Please make this remember it's
state between view instances and possibly add a setting in
Window->Preferences->Workbench->Search.

The new search becomes the default for M9 and the old will be removed. So now 
way out. If you prefer to see a flat list of the result in Java Search you can 
switch to a flat layout using the view menu. Furthermore there are buttons in 
the view part which control which "parents" are shown. If you switch to type 
then you get an almost flat list of type.

Thomas, just a reminder that the layout should be persisted (if it isn't 
already).
Layout it now persisted. (This PR is a dup of one I don't have handy that was
fixed recently).
