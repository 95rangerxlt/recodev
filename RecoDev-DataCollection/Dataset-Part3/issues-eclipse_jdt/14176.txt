Build M5

Related to Bug 13587

I really like the new Overview Ruler.  However I find it very difficult to 
click on a 'tick' in the ruler.

An error tick is about 5 pixels high.  But it seems like you have to click in 
the top 3 pixels or so to actually have the click registered.  I've made very 
sure that my mouse cursor was pointing inside the tick, but it still ignores 
my click if the cursor is in the bottom part of the tick.

When the user clicks in the ruler and there is no immediate match we should try 
again with a 2 pixel slop above and below.
Note that I was clicking within the box. I get no response if I click in 
bottom few pixels of the box.
The fix for #13587 increased usability. Please reopen if still neccessary.
