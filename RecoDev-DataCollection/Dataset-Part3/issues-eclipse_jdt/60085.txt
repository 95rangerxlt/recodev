Build 20040427

Implementing fix for bug 52805, it appears that our name for the compiler 
option JavaCore.COMPILER_PB_SUPERFLUOUS_SEMICOLON should be changed to:
JavaCore.COMPILER_PB_EMPTY_STATEMENT.

Accordingly, the message shown in pref page should no longer only say:
'Unnecessary semicolon', it should also mention the case where an empty control-
flow statement is now detected, e.g. if (bool);

Suggesting:   Empty statement
as it will capture most cases (though we also issue unnecessary semicolons in 
non statement positions...).

Ideally, I'd like this change to be done for the next integration rebuild.
I don't plan to preserve compatibility of previous recorded preferences which 
would reference the wrong key.
btw why did you duplicate all JavaCore pref constants on your end ? This feels 
like a waste of energy ?
