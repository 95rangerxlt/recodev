Data to follow shortly.
If you start up a previously-built workspace which did a snapshot
before doing the first build, then the build state cache would be
cleared and the workspace would perform a full build, rather than
reading the restored build state and performing an incremental build.


This has been fixed and verified.   Details available in the reference
PR 1GTOHRQ.

This bugzilla report was created for tracking purposes.
