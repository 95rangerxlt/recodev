Against N20050525-0010.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Create a project named "directions", with a package named also named
"directions".  (I'll attach an example)

2) Select the project name, and Run As > JUnit Test

3) Select the package name, and Run As > JUnit Test

Two launches named "directions" are created.

Interestingly, if you swap steps 2 and 3, then the launches are given unique
names (the project launch is named "directions (1)".

Patch

When trying to create a unique launch name for package a in project a, JUnit
was passing "a/a" to LaunchManager.generateUniqueLaunchConfigurationNameFrom
(see bug 98657).  Now, it just passes "a", and everything is happy.
Here's another one.
