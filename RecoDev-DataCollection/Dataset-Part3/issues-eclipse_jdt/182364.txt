APT checks type names for types generated via the Filer interface.  However, it is also rejecting type names that JDT would merely warn about, e.g., package names with capital letters.

It should only reject type names that are actually illegal.

The relevant code is in AbstractCompilationEnv.validateTypeName().  Test case for type name validation (which does not currently test the warning scenario) is in AptBuilderTests.testGeneratingIllegalTypeName().

With proposed patch, we now check whether status.matches(IStatus.ERROR) rather than status.isOK().
Jess, please review.
+1 This prevents users from creating legal packages.
Fixed for RC1.  AptBuilderTests updated.
