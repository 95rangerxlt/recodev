Thanks for reporting this Satyam. This was fixed in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=380194#c18, but I see that
that commit failed to release all the relevant files. I'll fix this
shortly.
Released full fix via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=fff49fd0bdbee760e61edee27f88554273119578.
