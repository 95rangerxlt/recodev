In the "Package Explorer" one often ends up with complicated or long paths to the jar files that are 
rererenced, and because of this the file name often ends up outside the viewable area, the explorer 
being relatively narrow.  

The idea here is simply to replace the label text with "shortname (path)"  in stead of "path/shortname".  
I.e. in stead of the current label text that might be 

    M2_REPO/junit/junit/3.8.1/junit-3.8.1.jar

Use

    jarfile.jar (M2_REPO/junit/junit/3.8.1)

or

    jarfile.jar (M2_REPO/junit/junit/3.8.1/junit-3.8.1.jar)


This way, one can always see the name of the jar file in the browser.

Kersten, this works for me as you describe (see attached screen shot). Can you

In this screenshot I cannot see the name of the .jar files

I need to widen the navigator this much to be able to see the names of files
I reopened this bug with some screenshots to illustrate the issue.

I submitted some screen shots to illustrate my point.    In your example, you reference a jar file that is 
located within the project repository, and in this case the path is so short that the effect of this proposed 
enhancement would not be different from what you already get.  The value lies in situations where you use 
jars that exist outside the project, by some possibly longer path.
