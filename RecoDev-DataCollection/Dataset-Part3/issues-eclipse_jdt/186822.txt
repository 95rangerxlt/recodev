Right now the following test case fails with a syntax error:
public @interface X<T> {
	
	Zork foo();
}
----------
1. ERROR in X.java (at line 1)
        public @interface X<T> {
                          ^
Syntax error on token "X", { expected after this token
----------
2. ERROR in X.java (at line 1)
        public @interface X<T> {
                               ^
Syntax error, insert "}" to complete Block
----------
3. ERROR in X.java (at line 1)
        public @interface X<T> {

        Zork foo();
                               ^^^^^^
The interface X cannot define an initializer
----------
4. ERROR in X.java (at line 3)
        Zork foo();
        ^^^^
Zork cannot be resolved to a type
----------
4 problems (4 errors)

we could change it to also report the error on Zork.
----------
1. ERROR in D:\tests_sources\X.java (at line 1)
	public @interface X<T> {
	                    ^
Syntax error, annotation declaration cannot have type parameters
----------
2. ERROR in D:\tests_sources\X.java (at line 3)
	Zork foo();
	^^^^
Zork cannot be resolved to a type
----------
2 problems (2 errors)

This is much more understandable for the user.

Proposed fix

Parser resources

Unzip in the Parser folder.
The patch looks good.
Enum should also be improved.
Updating title accordingly.
Released in HEAD.
Added regression tests in org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression.AnnotationTest#test227 and
org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression.EnumTest#test144.
I also updated existing diet recovery test for the annotations.

David, please review the changes.
