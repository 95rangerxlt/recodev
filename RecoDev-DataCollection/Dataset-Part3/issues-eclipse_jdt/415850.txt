As a big test to catch potential regressions caused by null analysis using type annotations, I ran all JDT/Core tests at 1.8 with null annotations enabled.

Currently this produces 124 errors and 37 failures.

I'm going to work through these regressions and provide patches via this bug.

I'm going to work through these regressions and provide patches via this bug.
First causes identified:

 - running IncrementalTests with -Dcompliance=1.8 complains:
   "This test requires a 1.5 JRE"
   Unrelated to the study in this bug.


 - NPE in STB#resolveTypesFor(..)
   method.returnType can be null even for non-constructors, simple check to fix
   
   added NullTypeAnnotationTest#testBug415850_01() 
   which also detects an unrelated NPE in Annotation#isTypeUseCompatible() - fixed


 - NPE in QAE#resolveType(..)
   this.binding can be null, simple check to fix

   added NullAnnotationTest#testBug415850_a()


 - AIOOBE in ReferenceExpression#resolveType(..)
   happened when implicitly mapping 1. arg to method receiver.

   fixed using a paramOffset, test added as NullTypeAnnotationTest#testBug415850_03()


 - NPE in ImplicitNullAnnotationVerifier.collectOverriddenMethods(..)
   reveals that we can be called before connectTypeHierarchy()
   fixed by calling connectTypeHierarchy() on-demand from checkImplicitNullAnnotations

   added NullTypeAnnotationTest.testBug415850_04()


 - reported bogus type mismatch against enum constants
   - Enum constants are implicitly @NonNull
   - in several tests we have an enum as inner of a raw type
   - PTB#isAnnotatedTypeWithoutArguments() didn't correctly handle raw types
   fixed

   added NullTypeAnnotationTest#testBug415850_02()



Released via commit 37207b2312332e7eb9b138e12e2db23f9f9da53e

Down to 4 errors and 13 failures in tweaked tests,
of which I estimate 50% issues to be irrelevant.
More:

 - NPE in BinaryTypeBinding#getField() for EnumTest#test180() f. revealed:
   certain recursive structures could trick the compiler into bad processing order:
   - creating a BinaryTypeBinding for an enum we are asking for null defaults in the
     current package
   - the package has a package-info with an annotation
   - the annotation references the enum in a member value pair
   This requires to read a FieldBinding from a half-initialized BinaryTypeBinding

   Solution is to further fine tune processing order:
   - scan the type for default null annotations 
     - after fields and methods have been created
     - before fields and methods are scanned for null annotations
       (which wants to fill in the default, if no explicit annotations are found)

   Added NullAnnotationTest#testBug415850_b()

 
 - Bogus compatibility errors in NegativeTypeAnnotationTest.testBug399453() et al
   show that ArrayBinding#isCompatibleWith(..) must use unannotated(), too.
   Also LookupEnvironment.createArrayType(TypeBinding,int,long[]) had a bug, fixed.

   Added NullTypeAnnotationTest.testBug415850_05()


Irrelevant:

 - EnumTest.test001() complains:
   	BLEU = null;
	       ^^^^
   Null type mismatch: required '@NonNull X' but the provided value is null
   This error is good if null annotations are enabled, since we regard enum constants
   as @NonNull

 - BatchCompilerTest.test013() correctly detects the tweaked option default


 - ASTConverter15Test.test0230(): with null annotations enabled we actually get
   the desired result (which we don't get normally, as documented in the test).
   (3 compliance levels)


Next bunch released via commit 1829731a70d63f049379e6ceb23edadc61e7b589


At this point I'm down to 3 bogus warnings (unchecked conversions) in
ASTConverter18Test.test0011() ff. Which should be easily fixable similar to
testBug415850_05() above.
Final issue was:
 - TypeReference#resolveAnnotations() created tagBitsPerDimension even if all elements
   where 0 => bogus warning re unchecked conversion.

   Test added as NullTypeAnnotationTest.testBug415850_06()

Release via commit 365e7f87646ce6e1751b8c49284326393484178c
