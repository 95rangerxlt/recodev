Refactring has the same problem
The operation can't be forked but has to be called in the UI thread because as 
soon as an editor is open on a file that is touched an invalid thread access 
error is thrown.
The editor updates on document changes directly, it does not post events to the 
UI thread. I think we have to look at this again as this got more severe with 
the introduction of pluggable buffermanagers to jdt-core.

The operation is now run in a forked thread, but does syncExec for each 
modification.
