EG (7/9/01 6:42:51 PM)
	there are two fixes. 
	1) 	JDT fixes the context so that subtopics are inlined in the
			help context menu
	2)		DOC adds descriptive text to the parent topics so that it makes
			sense to show the subtopics as links inside the page.

	#1 says the info pop will have the additional subtopics

	Fix by doing #1

EG (25.07.2001 17:05:52)
	new proposal. remove subtopic links that point to empty pages.

EG (25.07.2001 18:46:31)
	fix done by AW.
	file submitted to Ottawa.

DM (9/12/01 5:00:42 PM)
	Verified for several views and dialog
	==> OK	 (tested views and most pref/prop
	pages but since PR is not specifying which pages are empty there might still some not being OK)
