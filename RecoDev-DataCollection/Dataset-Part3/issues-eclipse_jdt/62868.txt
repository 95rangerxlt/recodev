I used this quick assist but did not notice that my method was protected and
that the method got created in an interface.

If a method is protected and it only implements an interface then the quick
assist should not be enabled.

I see what you mean but quick fixes often allow you to create things that 
don't compile (immediatly). You might want to change the modifier to public as 
a next step. It's easier and more practical to create first and then fix as to 
first change the visibility. 
you could offer to do both steps since the current thing you do really can't be
left as is

that's right. but not for 3.0 if that's ok for you.
sure. this is nothing critical or must have for 3.0
*** Bug 62915 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I will add a fix so that in the 'private' case the method created is at 
least 'protected'
