build I20030115

- load org.eclipse.jface as source
- in the Package Explorer, select org.eclipse.jface/src
- the status line shows: org.eclipse.jface/src
- select org.eclipse.jface/scripts
- the status line shows: /org.eclipse.jface/scripts
- select org.eclipse.jface/src/org.eclipse.jface.action/Action.java
- the status line shows: org.eclipse.jface.action.Action.java  - 
org.eclipse.jface/src
- select org.eclipse.jface/src/org.eclipse.jface.action/package.html
- the status line 
shows: /org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/package.html

Leading slashes should be omitted.  We generally try to avoid using leading 
slashes in the UI.  Compare with the Navigator.

Also, note that using / to separate segments in package names leads to an 
inconsistency with what is presented in the view.
The view shows "org.eclipse.jface.action" but the status line 
shows "org/eclipse/jface/action".

Could still follow the same format as for Java files, showing pkg.file - 
srcFolder.
e.g. org.eclipse.jface.action.messages.properties - org.eclipse.jface/src
or: messages.properties - org.eclipse.jface.action - org.eclipse.jface/src

Nick, we are using the workbench label provider accessable by the 
IWorkbenchAdapter. This one we can't configure. Is the another label provider we 
can use, which we can configure to not render the leading /.  
Not sure I understand.  The workbench adapters for resource just returns the 
simple name, not the path.  See WorkbenchResource.getLabel.

Stupid me. I looked at the wrong code.


Now you get resourcename - path of parent without leading slash.
