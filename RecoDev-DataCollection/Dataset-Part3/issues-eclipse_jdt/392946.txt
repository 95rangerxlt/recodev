Add quick fixes for unused type parameters.

This is similar to unused method parameters, so fixes will also be similar (remove, add documentation).

Don't add a clean up to remove all, since this would break existing references.

The proposed fix and the junits attached.
* RemoveUnusedTypeParameterOperation:
- This class is only ever used with a single SimpleName. The constructor should not take an array.

* RemoveUnusedTypeParameterOperation.removeUnusedName(..):
- FixMessages.UnusedCodeFix_RemoveUnusedType_description is wrong here

* UnusedCodeFix.createUnusedTypeParameterFix(..):
- "if (isFormalParameterInEnhancedForStatement(name))" doesn't make sense here.
- "boolean removeAllAssignements" has a typo, and doesn't make sense anyway. There are no assignments to a type parameter.

* The label of the quick fix should say "type parameter", not just "type".

* LocalCorrectionsSubProcessor#addUnusedTypeParameterProposal(..):
- "if (problemId == IProblem.UnusedTypeParameter)" is unnecessary (always true)

* JavadocTagsSubProcessor:
- label should be "Document *type* parameter to ..."
- quick fix doesn't work for a method type parameter
- formatting: put "}" and "else {" on one line. You can leave an empty line before if it makes the code more readable.

Thanks, released as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=b56753a7cc02eaccb8de11f721340572b0ac7be4
with these changes:
- reverted most of the changes in AddMissingJavadocTagProposal. The additional mode is not necessary.
- we format "if (xxx)" with a space
- removed two Javadocs that didn't add valuable information
