I think 'never used' means that the value of this variable is never used. In your  example, you store 
a value in 'a', but you never read the value from 'a'. Then this variable is useless.
it's only a wording problem then.
would 'variable never read' be better?

for me, 'used' means 'read or assigned to'
It is a wording problem. 
Fixed error message wording.
