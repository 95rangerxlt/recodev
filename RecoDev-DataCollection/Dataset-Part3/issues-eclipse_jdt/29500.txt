After selecting organize imports on my project (to reduce the 4175 warnings
about unused imports I got when I upgraded to 2.1 M4), I decided that maybe this
was going to take longer than I thought, so I tried to cancel the action.  The
cancel button on the dialog didn't to do anything.  I can repeat this at will
with my project.  I'm using Sun's JDK 1.4.1_01 on Debian GNU/Linux, SWT/Motif.
