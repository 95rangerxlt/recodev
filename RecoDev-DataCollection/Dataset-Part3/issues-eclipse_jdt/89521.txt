'Edit > Undo' and 'Edit > Redo' menu items are enabled in the Package Explorer,
but they don't seem to do anything. All other views I checked have Undo/Redo
disabled (except for the Outline, which takes over the editor's menus).

The actions will doing something as soon as refactoring switches to global
undo/redo. I can remove the actions for M6 (easy fix).

The refactoring undo/redo are now converted to the global undo history. So the
actions actually do something if executed.
