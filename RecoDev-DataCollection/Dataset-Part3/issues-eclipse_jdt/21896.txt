Build 2.0

Currently I can filter out binary projects (which is a good feature), but I 
would also sometimes want to be able to hide non-shared projects (for quickly 
selecting them all and perform CVS actions for instance).

Also see related bug 21822

This would require an additional plug-in since
- JDT does not depend on Team
- Team does not depend on JDT
AND: the current filter solution is not in Platform component

Any suggestion?

We need some help from Team Core:
Either make the persistent property key plus the team nature ID (for backward
compatibility) API or offer an API method like isShared(IProject).

If this is done JDT UI could add a pre-req to org.eclipse.team.core.

The API already Exists. RepositoryProvider.getProvider(IProject) returns an 
instance of RepositoryProvider if a project is mapped to a repository and null 
otherwise. 

As an aside, I have created bug 30406 which requests a general filter mechanism 
from Platform UI. I believe this would be helpful as it would allow Team to 
define a Shared project filter that could be applied to any resource view. No 
idea if or when this will happen so you may want to go ahead with the JDT 
specific filter.
Thought this might be a good feature which can be implemented in no time.
Done.
