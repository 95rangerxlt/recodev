adam is the new delete pls check, could also be an interaction with auto indent.
don't know how to solve this nicely - i delete the method source range 
(+ the trailing semicolon and everything until the line break)

will have to consume the leading tabs as well, i think
i guess the tabs leading the methods have to be removed as well. 
have a fix - won't release now 
(editor is extremally sensitive to deletion ranges - off by one and it's toast)
needs more testsing
