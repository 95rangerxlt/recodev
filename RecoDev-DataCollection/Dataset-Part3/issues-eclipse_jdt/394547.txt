Steps to reproduce:
1. Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" in code below
2. Specify "Nested Class in 'C'
3. There is a compilation error in the resulting file ("cannot be declared static")

class ExtractClassBug {
    class C {
        // Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" (and specify "Nested Class in 'C'"
        int m;
    }
}

Bug Fix + Test
Nikolay, you need to sign the CLA and confirm in each bug report that you want to commit the change. For details see
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git#Contributing_via_Bugzilla
Thanks for the patch. It fixes the issue mentioned in the bug report.

Some comments:
- org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.Modifier.isStatic(int flags) can be used to check for the "static" modifier in #shouldParamClassBeStatic(..)
- We should also take care of the implicitly static class declarations (without explicit "static" modifier). 
For example:
interface ExtractClassBug {
    class C {
        // Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" (and specify "Nested Class in 'C'"
        int m;
    }
}
Here, class C is implicitly static. 
Bindings always include the implicit modifiers, so if binding is not null, then you should take the modifiers form there.
- Update the tests for the case of implicitly static class declaration.

Please take care of the following general guidelines also:
- Add your credentials to the copyright headers
- Make sure the copyright date is updated to 2013 (if not yet already)
- As a rule, make the patch as small as possible i.e. don't make any changes that are not necessary to fix the problem (like marking fields 'final' and adding '@Override' to methods in existing code). This makes the review easier and faster.
- Post this in the individual bug report as a comment: "This contribution complies with http://www.eclipse.org/legal/CoO.php"
Thanks Noopur Gupta,
I will follow your suggestions and submit a new patch. Hopefully I can do it quickly.
Hello Noopur,
I am having difficulty creating a combined patch. I have checked in 2 separate commits into my local git repository. I will attach the 2nd commit as a separate patch. If you have an easy way to create one patch from 2 commits please let me know. Otherwise hopefully you don't mind applying both patches separately.

> If you have an easy way to create one patch from 2 commits please let me know.

You can create a single patch for this fix by following these steps:
1. In the History view, showing eclipse.jdt.ui repository commits, select the commit which has no fix (the third from top, if the first two commits are the ones for this bug report).
2. Right click the selected commit, Reset > Mixed.
This will make all changes committed after the selected commit appear as outgoing changes. You can select only the changes for this fix and create a patch.

Please take care of the general guidelines. You could refer http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_UI/How_to_Contribute to configure your workspace with JDT UI specific Save Actions and follow the Coding Conventions mentioned there.
