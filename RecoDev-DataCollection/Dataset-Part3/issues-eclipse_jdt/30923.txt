There doesn't seem to be any reason why I can't use Refactor->Rename for local 
variables inside a static initializer block.  For example:

static{
  int foo=0;
  foo=1;
}

I should be able to highlight foo and rename it, however the refactor 
complains about having a valid selection.

Adam, any reason why this is not possible. If it is trivial, we could do something for 
2.1, otherwise we have to postpone it.  
 
There are other refactorings as well that don't work with static initializers. 
rename will be enabled for RC1
other things like extract temp are less trivial and will be deferred
all tests are green so good to go for m5
