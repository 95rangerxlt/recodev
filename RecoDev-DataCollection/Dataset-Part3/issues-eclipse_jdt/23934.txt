Steps to recreate:
- load up junit source and navigate to/open ActiveTestSuite 
- select one of the constructors and remove the last 'e'
- click on the resultant quick fix
- the problem observed it that there is no return type and the proposed fix is 
to make the return type void.

The correct answer in this case is to notice that the method is a constructor 
and offer to fix the typo in the method name.
