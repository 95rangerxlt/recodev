From the JSR 308 specification:

"An annotation on a wildcard type argument appears before the wildcard, as in MyClass<@Immutable ? extends
Comparable<MyClass>>."

This needs to be supported by the ECJ. A simpler example is:

class MyClass<@Immutable ? extends Object> {}

Proposed fix

This patch allows annotations for wildcard. Unfortunately the fix also allows other modifiers in front of wildcards, which should be fixed. I struggled a bit to fix that, but looks like it's not going to be a simple fix. And since Srikanth anyway has some idea to simplify the grammar (in bug #385293), I am assuming that this will be taken care of too.

One of the tests will currently fail without a JSR 308 enabled JDK, but I have anyway added just to illustrate the test case. Will alter it to pass before releasing.
The changes done in the grammar and parser are rendered obsolete by
the fix for bug 390784.

I retained the changes in Wildcard.java with minor modifications[*] and
also released the tests -- Thanks Jay !

[*] No need to introduce wildcardAnnotations field in Wildcard.
Wildcard being a TypeReference inherits the 'annotations' field from 
the super class.

Fix and test released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e0048708b1f289d431c0dd85e7c6b6e3c3eaa0d5
