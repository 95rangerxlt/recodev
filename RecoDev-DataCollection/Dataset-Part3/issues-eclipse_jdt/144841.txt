Walter, do you have checkin permission on org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv?

proposed patch to HTML file

Added a table row for the API in org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.  There is no API in org.eclipse.jdt.apt.ui.

Jess, I do have commit privileges on jdt.doc.isv; but given where we are in the release cycle I think even trivial changes should probably be reviewed.  Dani, please review and then with your approval I'll commit this (or you can).  Thanks!
Hi Walter, I reviewed your fix, committed it and released into the upcoming I-build.
