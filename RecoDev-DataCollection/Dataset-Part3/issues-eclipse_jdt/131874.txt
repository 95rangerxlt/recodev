The  Java > Compiler > Javadoc > Process Javadoc checkbox not only affects problem reporting but also search functionality (and hence refactoring, typing etc.). From looking at the preference people could get the impression that it only controls problem reporting.

It should be made more explicit to the user that he will lose other important features and not just problem reporting.

will have to improve doc
I'd add a comment/additional sentence to the preference page.
What label are you suggesting?
For example:

[ ] Process Javadoc
    <em>Note: This not only affects the settings below but all JDT features related to Javadoc, like searching, refactoring.</em>
fixed > 20060423

new: Process Javadoc comments (includes search and refactoring)
