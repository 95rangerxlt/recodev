Get and setters are normallly self documenting, thus
Javadoc comments generation should be optional for getter and setters.
Currently javadoc generation is either all or nothing.

This seems to be fixed in 3.0M8 at least. The generate getters/setters dialog has a "Generate Javadoc" 
checkbox.

I wish the checkbox would remember my previous choice though, it's a little painful to remember to
