Using the following method:

public void foo(String... strings) {
}

Writing a method call and using Ctrl+Space for completion help, method foo is

Changing to String... instead of String[] when using varargs would be nice.

This is indeed a bit unfortunate. I had existing code witout compile errors ...

    Method method = clazz.getMethod("evaluate", Object.class);

... and pressed Ctrl+Space after 'getMethod('.
The popup says the method has signature 'getMethod(String, Class[])'
