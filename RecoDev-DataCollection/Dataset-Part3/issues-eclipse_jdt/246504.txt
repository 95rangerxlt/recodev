The standard Java perspective has a context menu, right-click a Jar file in a project and select "Add to Build Path".  This option seems to be missing in the Java EE perspective.

This request is to add the Build Path _> Add to Build Path context menu for the Java EE perspective.

This request is to add the Build Path _> Add to Build Path context menu for the Java EE perspective.
The Java perspective uses the Package Explorer view to display projects and their content. The Java EE perspective uses the Project Explorer view respectively. It seems that the "Build Path" context menu does not show on all nodes in the Project Explorer. 

Moving the bug to the JDT project, because they register the actions in both views. 
Fixed in HEAD.
