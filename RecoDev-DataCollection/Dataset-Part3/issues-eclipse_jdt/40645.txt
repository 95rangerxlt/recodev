released a temporary fix
Adam, please comment
field names are overloaded and they probably should not - easy to fix
in InlineTargetCompilationUnit i will leave the current names (i.e. 
fInitializer, fInitializer2, fInitializer3) - it's really the same field passed 
around. (i added a comment to explain why they're called so strangely)


Markus, can you have a look at InstanceMethodMover and decide what to do with 
the names there?
btw. it's up to you - you can decide to leave them 'as is'
It's exactly the same situation: The field is passed to avoid touching the
private status of the parent field. Apply this patch or leave it as is:
