It often happens that I want to add some interface (say IFoo) to an existing 
class (say Bar).  IFoo defines some methods. Since Bar is now an IFoo, it must 
provide implementations of these methods. It would be great if I could select 
Bar and choose "implement interface methods" (or some such).  The result should 
be a dialog with all of the unimplemented interface methods.  The user can 
check off which they want to implement.  JDT would then generate the required 
methods with some nifty comment indicating that the method is an implementation 
of an interface method.

'override methods' does not do the job?
'Override Methods' does exactly what you suggested. (available in context menus 
on types)
Is the confusion that the action is called "override methods" and 
not "implement method"?
don't want to answer for Jeff but i'm pretty sure:
it should be called 'override/implement methods' (just like in _the other_ java 
tool <g>)
will rename action
renamed action to override/implement methods > 20020920
