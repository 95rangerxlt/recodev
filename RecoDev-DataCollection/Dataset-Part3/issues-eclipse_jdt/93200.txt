When creating a new class there is no option to prevent the inclusion of a
default  'super()' method invocation.  However when using the Source > Add
Contructors from Superclass context menu I can omit these calls.  It is
extremely annoying to have to continue to take these out as that is what our
coding stanrds require and the ant process checks for.  The ui should be
consistent and provide a checkbox to exclude these default calls in the New
Class Wizard and maybe the Enum wizard to if it is relevant.

Will not make it into 3.1. 3.2 candidate.
Note that enum ctors should never get a super() call.
Is this inhancement planned for 3.2 still?
I think this is a bug, we shouldn't create the empty super calls by default.
I don't want to add a checkbox for this, it's really a detail.
