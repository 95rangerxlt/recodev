Hello,
I would suggest a new feature for refactoring purpose. It could be nice to have 
a menu item which enables the user to know visually all the methods wich are 
not called by someone. An icon (like the error icon) could be then settled for 
this.
regards
Xavier

sorry, not for 2.0
[refactoring] [search]

IMO this should be integrated with Search. As a result you get a list of unused 
method with an option to remove that method.
Yes, it seems good to me...
In 2.1 on the Java compiler pref page set 'Unused private members' to 'Warning'
or 'Error'.
