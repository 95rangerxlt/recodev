As you can see in the screenshot, I'm standing after the first character of the
method and pressing Ctrl+Space to invoke auto-complete. I expect to be presented
only with valid completions, but the "lazy" template is not one of them in this
context (actually it would introduce compilation errors).

This is always reproducible.

Screenshot for the error
Depends on bug 110181: more context information from the jdt.core infrastructure.
fixed in 3.4 M6 with the new template locations. lazy is now in the 'Java statement' context and only shows up when completing statements.

Note that if you made changes to the template you'll have to go to the template page and manually set the context to 'Java statement'
