It would be nice if Eclipse for the following code

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Object[] foo = new Object[10];
    foo[0];
  }
}

for the "foo[0]" line would provide the "Assign to new local variable/field" quick fixes.

We have a recovered AST here, but it looks a bit strange.
this works now in 3.2
