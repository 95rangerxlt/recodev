After some time of editing it seems that since integration build I20030115 
annotations sometimes stop working. I.E. the underlining of errors in the 
editor disappears, although the lightbulbs do still appear in the margin on the 
left. After stopping and restarting Eclipse the underlines are back. I cannot 
reliably reproduce this bug but I thought I would report it anyway. I will 
attatch my preferences file in case it helps. If I can reproduce it reliably I 
will add to the bug report!

i have seen that too (20030121)
sureley this bug should be looked at for one of the 2.1 Milestones. 
Current build.
I have build 200302111320 and I still see it happening! When you say current 
build do you mean a later build than 200302111320?
