There are two cases when deleting (or performing other modifications):

1) CU is open in editor [this works as expected]
- when deleting a CU (or Java element > CU) the user is asked: yes/no
- when deleting a Java element < CU  (e.g. type) it directly deleted in the
editor (because there's undo)

2) CU is not open in editor [this scenario is currently wrong]
- when deleting a CU (or Java element > CU) the user is asked: yes/no
- when deleting a Java element < CU (e.g. type) the user can't say no
==> if the CU is not open in an editor then the user should always be asked if
the action (e.g.) should be performed

There is undo support in both cases (undo of text buffer, add from local 
history). The distinction might is to subtle for the user, but in general a UI 
should not prompt for confirmation when there is undo support.

We should show a hint that "deleted" methods can be retrieved from the local 
history and provide an option to not show this hint again.
deleting always asks for confirmation now
which is consistent with the navigator and was on M5 working list
closing as fixed
