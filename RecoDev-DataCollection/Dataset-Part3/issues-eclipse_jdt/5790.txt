Using the new builder I am no longer able to perform evaluations, as the 
projects claim not to have a built state. An error dialog always appears saying 
that I must build the project at least once.

Can we improve this one for the short term ? If not, then we have a temporary 
problem...
It is actually code in the EvaluationContextWrapper that is making the check, 
so the debugger cannot work around this. This breaks the scrapbook as well as 
debugger evaluations.
Added additional check in hasBuildState() to check the new build state too.
Fixed
