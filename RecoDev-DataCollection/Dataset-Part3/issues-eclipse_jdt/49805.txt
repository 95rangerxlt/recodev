Created a variable for JDOM. Pointed to the JAR. Works fine, all errors are gone when returning to 
source. Go back into properties and expand the jar node and click to stipulate the location of the 
JavaDoc. Point to the folder, click validate. It is valid and the system opens the JavaDoc in a 
browser. Close properties and then go back in. JavaDoc location is blank.

Same problem on Eclipse 2.1.2 on Windows. When adding a javadoc location for a
JAR file not using a classpath variable, the javadoc location is added to
.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.ui\javadoclocations.xml. This does not happen
when the JAR file is referenced using a classpath variable. 

The only way I've found to get it working is to manually add the jar, using it's
absolute path, and the javadoc location to
.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.ui\javadoclocations.xml
