Build ID: I20090129-1800

To Reproduce:
1) Create a class A
2) Close the editor, reveal class A in the package explorer
3) Start the rename refactoring for class A via the package explorer's context menu, name it B
4) go back to the last edit location using alt-left
observe: there is an editor opened for file A which does not exist anymore.
observe: the package explorer now shows a resource A alongside with B, even though it does not exist. Trying to open the file results in an error.

5) keep the editor for the non-existant file A open
6) in the package explorer, start the rename refactoring again, rename the class A again

observe: no error is shown
observe: the editor for the non-existant file A becomes dirty.
observe: the class B still exists and is not touched at all
observe: all references to B in other files are change to A, leading to compile errors

reopening, as the real problem started with step 5. I agree that steps 1-4 are covered with bug 148925

Note that in my case, i had an editor for a non-existent file open, I was not aware of it. I did the refactoring back to the old class name and got tons of compile errors.
>reopening, as the real problem started with step 5.
Right, but you can't reach step 5 if the other bug is fixed ;-)

Anyway, that a CU appears in the Package Explorer when a deleted resource is opened in the editor is not good.

Fixed in HEAD.
