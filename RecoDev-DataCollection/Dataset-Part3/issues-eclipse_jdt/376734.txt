Hi Marek, what's the motivation behind the backport? Note that it was not a regression.
Hello, this problem was classified as data loss that is why I was asked to
create bugzilla backport request.

Yes, I'm reviewing it for backport. Thanks.
The code in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.dom.rewrite.ImportRewriteAnalyzer.addExistingImports(CompilationUnit) lines 281 - 297 is not right in the way it calculates ranges of comments before and after an import. However, I've not able to trigger the code that finally uses the two new fields org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.dom.rewrite.ImportRewriteAnalyzer.ImportDeclEntry.precedingCommentRange and trailingCommentRange via the get..() methods, such that they have non-null values. 
Even the new tests don't trigger that condition. I'll keep trying and open a new bug.
The backport should be done when bug 376930 is fixed.
This patch is good if applied with the fix for bug 376930.

Dani, need your +1 as well.

What's the patch to backport? The attached one? It does not include any test cases.

Marek and I assumed that tests are not backported. If they are, then I guess the whole patch from bug 24804 should be backported.

patch + tests to backport

This is the full patch taken from bug 24804. It also contains a JDT.UI test - ImportOrganizeTest.

That I'd leave out, because it creates additional work on the JDT UI side for the backport.
+1 to backport this along with bug 376930, excluding the JDT UI tests.

I and Dani decided that these tests are necessary to be backported to reflect the new behaviour because of the patch. Hence, raised bug 378068 to track the UI backport.
