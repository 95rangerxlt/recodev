didn't i suggest that before?
<g>
this depends on bug#4328 should decouple IChange performing from 
RefactoringWizard (1GLDK52)

performing a refactoring is now tightly coupled with the wizard.
once decoupling is done - creating a special ui for the 3 refactorings 
(rename resource, rename project rename source folder) will be not difficult.
fixed without waiting for 4328 - duplicated some code (PerformRefactoringUtil)

should refactor the solution at some point
