it has something to do with that automatic ident..

I have this class:

package test;

public interface Test
{
	public interface TestInner
	{
		String str = new String();
		// this is some comment
	}
}

now copy the line String str = new String(); into the buffer

then make a new line between String str and // this is some comment
and don't go to the completele beginning of the line and do the paste
Then the cursor is somehwere in the comment

if you start at the complete beginning of the new line that it goes OK.
