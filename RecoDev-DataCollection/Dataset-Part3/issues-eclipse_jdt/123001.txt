Consider the following class (also attached):

public class TestAddOverride {

	private int myInt;
	
	private class PrivateClass {
		public PrivateClass() {

		}
	}
}

Enable folding and fold the inner classes.

Now add a new getInt method with "Generate Getter and Setter".

The addition confusses the folding mechanics (though the underlying document and file is correct). See attached picture. The only way to correct the problem is to close and re-open the editor.

If the inner class is NOT folded, the new method is shown correctly.

Adding methods by other means (e.g. Override/Generate Methods of Object.toString()) yields the same result.

Upps. Forgot to state that I use 3.2M4.
This has been fixed during M5 development (most likely by fixing bug 120383). Tested uisng I20060103-0800.
