Build I200402050800.

I wanted to open a type and use Ctrl-Shift-T to launch dialog.
I only had Progress Information dialog opened and after a long time, I decided 
to Cancel it. The Cancel button turned grey but nothing happened and Progress 
information was still opened...

No exception occured in my log.
I will attach snapshots of threads I got in the console using Ctrl-Break while 
waiting for the dialog opening... As you'll see in "ModalContext", 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.util.AllTypesCache.getAllTypes was waiting for 
something which seemed never happen...

The only solution then was to cancel my eclipse and restart it...

Threads states using Ctrl-Break key in console

I hit Ctrl-Break several times to see if there were any change in thread
states.
Not obvious, except thread "Worker-76" which was replaced by "Worker-88" at the
end...
Had been fixed for some earlier milestone.
Please reopen if you see problem again.
