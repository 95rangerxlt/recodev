New Gerrit change created: https://git.eclipse.org/r/44787
In context of hte #greatfix initiative I have pushed a branch for review with these two templates, based on the proposed templates, but for "java-statements" context instead of "java" context, as these do not make any sense outside the java-statements scope.

Please assign me and add the greatfix keyword.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/44787 cannot be considered for greatfix as most of the implementation was already available as a patch in comment #2.

This can be committed as your contribution once the following issues are handled:
- Fix test failures and update the tests by adding new tests for the new templates.
- See duplicate bug 373471 which needs the new template 'finally block' to just add the keyword 'finally' with a block - similar to template for "else block".
- The other template (added in this patch) could be 'try finally' that adds try finally block - similar to template for "try catch block".
- Update copyright header in the files. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_UI/How_to_Contribute#Coding_Conventions.
- The template for lock looks fine.
I didn't know that fixing patches and getting them accepted doesn't count as a greatfix, but it totally makes sense. Thanks for the comments on the proposal though, I knew about the failing tests since I saw the logs, but I'm having a hard time correctly setting up a testing environment, but the other comments are new and useful for me, next time I won't forget updating the headers.
I'll update the gerrit request once I manage to fix the failing tests and the rest of the issues.

Sure. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_UI/How_to_Contribute for setup and other details.
Fixed all issues mentioned above (hopefully I didn't miss anything), and rebased to master. Please let me know if you see anything else to fix in the updated patchset.

Thanks, I made the following changes and released the patch:
- Copyright year should be incremented instead of adding the year again in all the modified files.
- Renamed the existing 'try' template to 'try_catch'.
- Renamed the new 'tryfinally' template to 'try_finally'.
- TODO is not required in 'finally' template. Similar to the 'else' template.
- In AdvancedQuickAssistTest, moved the tests for new templates at the end of each test method.
