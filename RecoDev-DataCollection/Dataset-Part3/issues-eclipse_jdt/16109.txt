I am finding the new organization of the java editor context menu to be a bit 
frustrating.  Perhaps out of habit, but I have failed looking for:

- text search
- revert
- others I can't recall atm

"Revert" is especially challenging since its in the File menu, but undo/redo 
are in Edit (as they should be, but its just that the old edit context menu 
pulled these to one place).  I don't happen to know the accelerator for Revert.

As I said, perhaps I've just been trained to look for these here all the way 
back to VA for Smalltalk (VAJ had them too I believe).

However, none of Word, Wordpad, nor Notepad have Revert at all so I guess its 
just VAST/VAJ.

I would add that if we are trying to get the popups smaller, I would guess that 
few pick copy/cut/paste/select-all from the popup since most use the 
accelerators I would think.  I guess having them there is needed for other 
reasons? (improved accessibility?  style?)
revert is back.

not having cut/copy/paste in the menu was discussed with UI folks. Everybody 
symphatizes but nobody has the courage to do it.
