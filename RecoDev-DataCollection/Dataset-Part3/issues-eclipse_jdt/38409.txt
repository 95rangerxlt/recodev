1. Open a Java editor, add some errors: Errors get underlined by the Java editor
2. At a location without error make a selection with the mouse. While enlarging
the selection you see that all error underlines are flickering.

Seems to be new in 3.0, because the flickering does not appear in 2.1.1

Knut, is that a StyledText problem or JDT UI ?

I loaded all Platform UI and SWT plugins from head in a 20030528 workspace. The 
inner Eclipse running with that code base does not exhibit this problem. Seems 
to be JDT text.
The code painting the squiggly lines (i.e. any text annotation) does not 
differ between 2.1.1 and the 3.0 code stream. Will check with M1 build.

Exposed by change of default setting of the synchronization preference. Scope 
surrounded by setRedraw(false) - setRedraw(true) was too wide.
