Given:
public class E5 {
	String s1= Messages.E5_0;
	String s2= "f";
}
1. Source->Externalize Strings...
2. Configure...
3. Change 'Class name' to MyMessages
4. Next
5. Finish

Result:
public class E5 {
	String s1= MyMessages.E5_0;
	String s2= MyMessages.E5_1;
}

Which is same behavior as traditional style. Bug is that no field E5_0 is generated in MyMessages.
