There is an org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.Assert class that seems to be
very similar to org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert available in Eclipse 3.2.

As those classes seem to provide the same functionality, perhaps
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.Assert could be removed and references to
it changed to refer to the runtime class.

This bug is recorded from the general bug 30072.

fixed > 20060407
Restored org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.Assert in HEAD since jdt.ui, refactoring, and text test projects were not updated.

fixed the last references, marked old Assert as deprecated (will remove in 3.3)
