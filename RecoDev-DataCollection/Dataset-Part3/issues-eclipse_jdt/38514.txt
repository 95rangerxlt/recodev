I think it's not bad right now. Note that having the two comboboxes together
looks very dense.
accessability works woth the current layout
Another issue is that the widgets below the tree don't grab horizontal space. 
My personal feeling is that I agree with Andre's comments. But we should look 
at it first.
I agree with Martin that making this dialog more space efficient makes it look 
crowded.

The composite that contains the comboboxes should be grabbing horizontal, but 
it isn't functioning as I would expect. Martin, can you take a bo-peep at this?
