I did a pull up of a private field, and it added at the very end of the class, 
after all the methods.  It should place it just like quickfix does when a field 
is created (at the top);

Agree.
Fixed for I20040824.

Corrections in PullUpRefactoring, ASTNodes#getInsertionIndex(), JavaElementUtil,
and test cases.
