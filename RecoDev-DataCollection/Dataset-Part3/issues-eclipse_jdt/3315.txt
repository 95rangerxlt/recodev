The "New Class" wizard seems to be inefficient.  If you create a simple class with no superclass
or interfaces, or methods, and hit finish, the local history will contain three identical copies of the class.
It doesn't make sense that it should have to create three copies of the file.

	These are from manipulations done using Java Core routines (creating the body, adding the imports, adding methods,
	adding more imports, formatting).
	Even everything is done in one IWorkspaceRunnable, multiple local history entries are created.
	Java Core needs to honor IWorkspaceRunnable or provide something similar.
	Move to JCore

It appears to be a UI defect (should use working copies). If using compilation 
units, then our behavior is fine.

Moving to JDT/UI for disposal (still a dup of bug 3248).
We are now using working copies for this as suggested by Philippe. Works fine for 
integration build I20030129.
