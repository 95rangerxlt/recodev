There are various situations where I want a qualified type name to be inserted
by codeassist, as opposed to have a bonus import statement added.
If I mean it, there should be a way to get it (like shift+accept selection?).

e.g. when typing a snippet to copy/paste into a conditional breakpoint, when 
evaluating code on the fly.

Seconded.
You can now use code assist to insert a type fully qualified but you have to enter (e.g. using code assist) qualification yourself.
