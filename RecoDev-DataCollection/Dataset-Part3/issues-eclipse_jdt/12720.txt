Build 20020321

In the Packages view, I can drag a file from the file system onto a project, a 
package or a source folder.  However I cannot drag it onto a non-source folder.

I can, however, drag the file onto the project, and then drag it into the non-
source folder from within the packages view.

The packages view should allow me to drag a file into any folder, just like in 
the Navigator view.

the problem is that FileTransferDropAdapter accepts only 
IPackageFragments, IJavaProjects and IPackageFragmentRoots as targets
Didn't consider the case that source folder not on the class path aren't Java 
elements but normal IResources. 

Fixed in build > I20020502
