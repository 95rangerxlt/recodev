Highlight a method, choose to modify the return type to a class not yet imported.

This is a simple text box, and types not already defined result in a warning. 
(although you are allowed to continue)

Typing in the type and using 'organize imports' is workable, assuming I get the
spelling, capitolization, etc of the classname right.

It would be nice if this box had a "lookup" similar to the supertype box when
creating a new class.

Additionall we should create the correct import.
We now have code assist and generate the right import.
