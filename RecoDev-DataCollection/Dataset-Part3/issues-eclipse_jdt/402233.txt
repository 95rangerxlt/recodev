BETA_JAVA8:

The most specific applicable overloaded method resolution in Java8 differs from 
Java 7 in that it is not just a pair wise comparison of methods as in the case
of Java 7. The expression that constitutes the argument must also be taken into
consideration to decide which one of the parameter types is more specific.

This requires some infrastructure in the form of new methods in Expression
and its subtypes.

(It can be argued this new method belongs in type binding, but if we take
that route for poly expressions, we have to turn around and ask the expression
itself - given you are who you are which of T and S is more specific - Given
that I am proposing to implement this only in Expression)

See Expression.tIsMoreSpecific(TypeBinding t, TypeBinding s) and
all its overrides. These methods implement 15.12.2.5's rules that
start with:

"A type T is more specific than a type S for an expression exp according 
to the following rules:"

These methods are not "hooked in" yet - i.e., there are no callers as of
now. That will happen as a part of further work in most specific method
determination.
