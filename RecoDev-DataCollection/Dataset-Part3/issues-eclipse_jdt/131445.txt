I find the following template very useful and would suggest that it be included by default:
Name: ifnotnull
Description: if not null statement

if (${name} != null) {

If we add this we should also add an 'ifnull' template.
In 3.3, the template should look like this (so one gets proposals for local variables):

if (${v:var(java.lang.Object} != null) {
        ${cursor}
}


I think it's best to add the one you like by your own. This allows you to decide whether you want the use the brackets or not.
The question of brackets is not different than the current templates we provide like "if statement".

I think that programmers check "if not null" frequently enough that we should include the template by default. But of course, that's just my intuition.
Jared,

I'm willing to do this if you provide the patch for the 'ifNull' and 'ifNotNull' templates.

See bug 153880 for pending problems with the new template variable support.
ifnotnull and ifnull templates sound useful. I plan to provide a patch for them.

If so, please use the spelling suggested in comment 5.
