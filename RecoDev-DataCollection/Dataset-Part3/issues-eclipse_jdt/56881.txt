Since I'm now using M8 newly installed, there is also the default settings in it.
When auto-generating a new Visual Class with VE then the AutoCode looks like:

 * ${todo} To change the template for this generated file go to
 * Window - Preferences - Java - Code Generation - Code and Comments
 */

But this Path is no longer valid!!! 

It should be

Window - Preferences - Java - Code Style - Code Templates - Code and Comments
