The browse button to choose a Java package where properties file is going to be
saved (within the second page of Externalize String wizard) doesn't show empty
Java packages of the project.

So I had to create first a dummy Java class within the NLS package, externalize
the Strings and then delete the dummy Java class.

I understand this is a bug.

We should think about a homogenous package list viewer.
This got addressed. Tested on 200409070800
