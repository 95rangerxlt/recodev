I often press Ctrl+1 to assign a constructor argument to a new field in the
class. Most of the time the choice is not presented because I just finished
typing. So I have to wait and invoke quick fix again. Sometime I see quickfixes
for errors that are no longer in the code, etc.

Please make the quickfix proposal deterministic.

Martin, I believe you have this on your radar already?
Actually a dup of 108282.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 108282 ***
Not a dup: in bug 109282 the problem is a stale AST i.e. quick fix isn't working
even after several minutes and correct problem annotations
The here mentioned bug got fixed today. We now query and wait for the correct
AST before collecting the available quick fixes/assists.
