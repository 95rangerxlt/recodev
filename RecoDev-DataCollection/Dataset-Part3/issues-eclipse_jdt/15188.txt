The "Move" refactoring dialog should persist the "Update references to the moved
element(s)" preference.

In addition, the default setting for the button should be ON. The common case
for a refactoring is that the user wants us to update references.

Agreed that the default setting should be on.

However, we should not persist the setting, it should be on whenever the dialog 
shows up. This is consistent with the Rename refactoring behaviour.
fixed - update is default now
