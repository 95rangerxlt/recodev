To recreate this error, you must have two java projects set up.  Create a new
class file in one of the projects that refers to an existing class in the other
project.  In the project properties I'm resolving the foreign class file picking
"add class folder" and choosing the class folder from the other project but
leave out the import for now.  There should be an error in the new class about
the unresolved type.  Choose "organize imports" from the menu (or hit
ctl+shift+o).  You get the following error message:

Unexpected error in organize imports.  See log for details.

Reason:
classes/whatever (in other project) does not exist.

The exact same message appears in the log too.

Now manually type in the import the old way.  The class dependency is now
resolved and the error goes away.  After the import is added to the class file,
"organize imports" runs with no error.
