The keyboard accelerator for "Source/Comment" (Ctrl-/) does not work for non-
English keyboards.  I'm using a French keyboard mapping, where the '/' key of 
an English key mapping results in an 'é' (E acute).  To type a '/' you need to 
type Shift-3, and Ctrl-Shift-3 doesn't work (not to mention that it would be 
bothersome to type that, and "Source/Uncomment" wouldn't map to anything 
meaningful).  Unfortunately, using the '/' key on the numeric keypad doesn't 
work either, that would have been quite acceptable.

suggest to change ctrl-shift-/ to ctrl-\
*** Bug 16720 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Erich suggested changing ctrl-shift-/ to ctrl-\.  I just want to point out that 
this choice may cause similar problems, as using a Canadian French keyboard, 
pressing the '\' key of an English keyboard yields '<' (to actually type a '\' 
on such a keyboard, you have to type AltCar+[that key just left of '1'] -- 
AltCar being the RIGHT Alt key).

I'm sure the English folks must be banging their heads on the wall by now. :-)
asking KevinH for help
There is support for NL specific accelerator support, so this can be changed 
for French. We can stick to the previous suggestion.

The shortcut for comment the code isnt work in brazilian ABNT keyboard layout. 
I dont understand why the shortcut for uncomment works fine but for comment it 
dont work. I checked that if I change the layout(keyboard) to English the 
application works fine. But then I need to guess the position of the "/" 
and "\" characters at the keyboard. The shortcut for comment works fine at 
R2.0.2.
