Using Eclipse 2.0, Build F1 (buildid: 20020521) 
on Windows 2000.

This is rather trivial, but..

When a java editor opens there are 2 new buttons visible at the right end of 
the main toolbar (Next Problem, Previous Problem). These buttons are always 
enabled, even when there are no problems. When there are no problems clicking 
them does nothing. Why not simply disable them when there are no problems?

Next/previous problem also includes temporary problems. Right now there is no 
appropriate notification mechanisms indicating a change of the number of this 
problems. The annotation model has a notification mechanisms but connecting the 
action to the annotation model does not seem attractive.
Another strange thing about these buttons is, that they stay pressed if there 
is no problem.  After pressing again, they come back out.  Looks really 
strange.  Somehow the mouse event seems to be eaten if there are no problems.  
(So there's at least ONE problem. :-))
With I20030811 these two buttons will become more powerful: the user can check
in drop down list which annotation types should be considered when stepping
through next and previous annotations. This drop down should always be
accessible and therefore the drop down buttons must always be enabled.

Robert, the problem should be gone with tomorrows I-build (I20030811) as well.
