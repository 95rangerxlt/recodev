When creating a new class javadoc inserted (from filecomment and typecomment) 
doesn't include expanded variable values, ie if my template is 

/**
 * @author ${user}
 */

Then it is inserted as is, ${user} is not changed to real user name. Same 
applies to other variables.
I'm using 20001219 build.

Can't reproduce this bug in 0214 build, changing status to fixed.
