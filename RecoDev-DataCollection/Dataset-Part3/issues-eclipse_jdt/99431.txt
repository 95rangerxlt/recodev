3.1RC2 noon build
- observed on hpux and solaris
- probably happens on platforms where a Browser widget is not available

- open the javadoc view and a class that contains the @see javadoc tag
- put the cursor into this comment and it appears in the javadoc view
  -> note that the "See Also..." in the javadoc view is just appended to the
plain text that precedes it
- click into some other javadoc within the class, then click in the original one
again (with the @see tag) and its "See Also..." now appears properly in the
javadoc view
  -> now resize the javadoc view slightly and the "See Also:..." in the view
loses its bold font and joins the plain text above it again

This also happens in 3.2M4 on Linux.
Happens when in fallback mode (i.e. no Browser widget).
Fixed in HEAD.
