public static void main( String[] args )

  }

In an inner class the quickfix should suggest final for the static variable "a". The compiler is correct with his message "The field a cannot be declared static; static fields can only be declared in static or top level types..." but the editor should be able to fix it. Maybe the error message should be extended in a way that static final values are valid in an inner class.
