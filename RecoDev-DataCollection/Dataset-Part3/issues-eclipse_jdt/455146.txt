Quite often, you want to copy-paste a file into the same directory, because you want to create a file that is similar to the other one. When you do that, assuming that the filename is 'Foo.txt', eclipse suggest 'Copy of Foo.txt' for the new file. I find that completely useless, since no one ever wants a file named like that. It would be less hassle to just leave the original filename in there, with the error notification that a rename is required to avoid duplicate filenames.

Also, when this happens, the cursor is not in the textfield. This means that whenever you copy-paste a file into the same directory, you must then click into the cursor field, which is quite annoying.

So, to summarize: please suggest the original filename, instead of 'Copy of filename' and put the cursor in the textfield.

It's a minor thing, but something that happens quite a lot. From a UI perspective, it's good to make these small annoyances go away :-)

Thanks a lot!

This has been fixed in Eclipse 4.5, it now adds a number to the new file.
