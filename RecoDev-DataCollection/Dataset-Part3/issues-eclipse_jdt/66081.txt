When you delete a highlighted section of text which includes a folded javadoc 
above a method, instead of deleting it unfolds the javadoc comment and leaves 
it at that.

In this instance I am using either the DEL key.

If the intention is to 'save'(intended behaviour) the user from themselves, how 
about when it has unfolded those sections the highlight remains so that the 
user can proceed to hit DEL again.

Fixed in RC2. Selection stability and DEl key.
Not verified in 200406180010:

- The DEL key (and Edit > Delete) now deletes everything within the selection,
including folded regions and parts of folded regions.

- The Backspace key first opens enclosed folded regions and correctly retains
the selection. On second stroke, the selection is deleted.

Kai, please mark as verified if the current behavior of the DEL key is intended.
