Steps:

1)select a template and chose Edit
2)Alter some part of it.
3)Change the name of the template and select Okay.

Notice that the original template has disapeared. It would be better if, when I 
change the template name field, a dialog appears asking if I want to keep a 
copy of the original template. This is because I may (probably) want to create 
a new template based on an original template but don't want to lose the 
original. >20020409. JRT.
