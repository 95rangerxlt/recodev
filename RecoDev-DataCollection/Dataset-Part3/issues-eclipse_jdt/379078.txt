In M6/M7, the switch on enum started reporting warnings if the switch doesn't cover all the enum constants. This is causing many warnings in compiler.apt, compiler.apt.tests and apt.tests.

Proposed patch

Added default(s) to the switch statements.
Walter, Can you please review this patch? It is a small patch.
Walter, I want to release this changes in RC1. It will be nice if you can review it quickly.
Looks good.  Thanks for working on that.  A few very minor comments:

For MessagerProc.java, in the second switch, rather than just breaking in the default, you could add something like:

  default:
    System.out.println(element.getKind() + ": " + element.getSimpleName());
    break;

In BaseMessagerImpl, probably should add 'default' rather than OTHER; the ElementKind documentation says more kinds may be added.

In ElementsImpl, just to make the behavior clear, I might've done:

  default:
    return null;

but it is fine either way.

In TypesImpl, can you remove the auto-generated "// TODO Auto-generated method stub" line, and fix the typo (s/y/u/) in "Invalid type mirror for directSypertypes" while you're in there?
