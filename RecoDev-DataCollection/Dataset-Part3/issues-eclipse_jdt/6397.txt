Using the pluging import wizard, I imported org.eclipse.ui and all plugins it is
dependant on.  When I attempted to launch using the slim launcher, it failed
giving me the following messages:

Error reading platform info file
Reason:
Plugin descriptor is null
Error reading product info file
Reason:
Plugin descriptor is null

Workaround:
Import the org.eclipse.sdk plugin and Eclipse launches.

the problem is that the SDK plugin is required but it isn't a pre-requisite of 
any other plugin.
1) import all plugins (recommended)
2) don't import the plugins into the workspace location (don't check the first 
checkbox on the first page). We have improved the wording of this message.

Up to now we have resisted to add special knowledge about the SDK plugin. Vlad 
has explained us the mechanism today and we will look what we can do.
I added more validation checks to the launcher to warn about a non-
existing 'org.eclipse.sdk' or a missing 'install' folder.
