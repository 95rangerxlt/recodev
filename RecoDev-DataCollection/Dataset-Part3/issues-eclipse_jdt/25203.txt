Can you please be more precise
1) what exactly isn't reader accessible
2) what does moderatly keyboard accessible mean, between which areas can't you 
move.

Given the amount of information provided we cannot address this bug report.
1) If  you tab between the section, the information is not read by JAWS. I also 
check it out with MS Inpsect to see if it's a JAWS problem and there is no 
information reported on name, values, roles, state etc., so the problem is not 
with JAWS.

2) Not every section is navigable with a keyboard. If I have to rely on using 
the mouse, or mouse keys, or JAWS keys, then the UI is not keyboard accessible.


I believe there is enough information in here to address this bug. The problems 
are easily seen if you try to test accessibility function on the JUnit GUI.
thanks for following up with more details. There is definitly a problem here.

The wording that is not obvious to me is: 
"If  you tab between the section..."
"Not every section is navigable with a keyboard."
what do you refer to by section? Can you enumerate the labels/controls that you 
cannot navigate too.

There is a problem that you cannot navigate to the counter labels after Runs:, 
Errors:, Failures:. This is now fixed by changing them into read-only Text 
widgets.

Does this fix address your issues (I currently have no access to a JAWS reader) 
so I cannot verify this myself.
closing
just noticed that this bug got additional interest. So I'd appreciate if you 
can verify that the current UI is accessible enough.
