When i'm making mistake whith auto completition ( for example 
adding "com.sun.corba.se.connection.Connection" instead 
of "java.sql.Connection") i must press UNDO twice - first one to remove import 
and second one to remove autocompletition and move cursor to its previous 
position.
I think this undo action in this case should be one-click.

discussed with kai: the completion assistant could do this (around 'apply()')
