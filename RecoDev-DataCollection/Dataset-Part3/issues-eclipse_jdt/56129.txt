Patch for the buffer and line number determination handling

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.callhierarchy.

This patch removes the creation of an AST for determining the line number.

Markus, I'm not sure what you mean by "unused ctor", so I haven't done anything
about that.
Thanks Jesper, you're just too fast... . I filed the bug to make sure I don't
forget to have a look at this for M9 - it was not meant to be understandable ;-)

>>+ clean up caching of fCallText, fLineNumber
When the member has no source, this information was not cached in fCallText and
fLineNumber. I corrected that.

>>+ remove unused ctor
> Markus, I'm not sure what you mean by "unused ctor"
The constructor CallLocation(IMember, IMember, int, int) was not called
anywhere, so I removed it.

Organized imports in CallLocation.

Patch & additional changes released to HEAD.
