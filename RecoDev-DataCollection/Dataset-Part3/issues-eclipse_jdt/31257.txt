1. open GotoMarkerAction, try to move 'gotoPackagesView'
2. Dialog says 'Method cannot be moved.'
3. Note that gotoPackagesView could be static, it needs not instance accesses
4. It would be very good if the dialog also gives a reason why the move failed.

i guess it cannot be moved because possible target classes are none 
(all params have interface types and the field too)
But nevertheless the message should be more helpful.
As I said, the method I have could be static. To check if the method does not 
use any instance fields should be easy.

But even if it would use an instance field, the possible target types shouldn't 
be limited by the fields or param types. I should be able to move it anywhere 
(as a new static method)
words will be improved, but the rest is a feature request

how'bout p3 rc1 ?
Agree that makeing it static is an enhancement.
fixed
made the message pretty verbose now (which might be needed because this 
refactoring is pretty choosy about allowed methods):

"This method cannot be moved, since no possible new receivers were found. An 
instance method can be moved to source classes that are used as types of its 
parameters or types of fields declared in the same class as the method."
