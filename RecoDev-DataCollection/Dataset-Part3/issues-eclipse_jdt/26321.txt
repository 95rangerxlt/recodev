Dirk I assume you invoked quick fix via Ctrl+1, correct?
Quick fix via light bulb works for me.

The strategy for Ctrl+1 is to go from right to left until there's no error. It
was explicitly desired not to jump back and forth between nearest results.
However in the described case (no errors on the left side of the cursor in the
same line) it would be more intuitive to go from left to right.

Changing summary.

Fixed while adding templates to Ctrl+1
Also improved position guessing for cases where cursor already sits on quick
fixable problem.
