Suppose you an interface A and a class B.
Create this class:
public class MyA implements A {
  private A a;
  private B b;
}

Select "a" -> Right Click -> Source -> Generate Delegate Methods
Select All
instead of having just A's method generated, I have both A and B's methods.

Took me a while to notice that B's methods were also selected when I 
pressed "Select All". It is advisable that that the tree of methods is expanded 
fully when pressing "Select All".

The tree is now expanded when the dialog pops up.
