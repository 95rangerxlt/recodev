Steps:

1) remove filters in packages view and make sure the layout is hierarchical.
make sure default package is visible
2) interduce an error into a cu in a package fragment at depth 2 or 3 in the 
tree (it actually doesn't matter). Notice that while the tree hierarchy is 
decorated with error ticks so is the default package though there is not way 
it should have an errror.
