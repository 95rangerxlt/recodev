Copy this code into an editor:

public class MyClass
{
    protected final String  _x;
    protected final String  _y;

}

Now, right-click in the area between the field declarations and the closing "}".  Try to execute the "Generate Constructor from Fields..." source action.  A dialog pops up that says "The selected type contains no fields which may be initialized in a constructor".

This is of course the opposite of the truth since these final fields *must* be initialized in the constructor for the class to compile.
