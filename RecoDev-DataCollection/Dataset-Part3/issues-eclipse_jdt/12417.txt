i meant 'there's no way' 
Which way are you creating the scanner?

If you want comments and whitespaces, you have to 
use:
ToolFactory.createScanner(true, true, false); // false if you don't want to be in assert 
mode

Let me know if this is the way you created your scanner.
yes, i use ToolFactory
(well, for now i use new Scanner(...)) but wanted to move to using the API

but these token IDs are missing
If you properly toggle the scanner factory method, then it will tokenize these 
tokens, see Olivier's comment.

Please reopen if you can provide a test case where it doesn't work.

Closing
i do get them tokenized 
but how do i know (using API types) that i have one of these tokens in hand?

the only way is to use constants defined in Scanner
but Scanner is not API
Constants surfaced on ITerminalSymbols.

Fixed.
