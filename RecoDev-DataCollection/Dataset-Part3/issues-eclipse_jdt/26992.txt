I tried to load an existing project that uses a classes folder as the output 
folder. When creating the new project the source folder was properly computed, 
but the output folder wasn't.
If we find class files we should also attempt to compute the output folder.

not so easy: running in conflict with output folders. moving to later
reopening.
