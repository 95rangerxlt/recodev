If a class implements an interface, it should be possible to delegate all 
interface methods to one single member field.

An example:

public class DelegateConnection implements Connection
{
    private Connection _realConnection;
    // every method of connection is delegated to real connection
    // should also work if interface connection changes after the class
    // is created.
}

Agreed, this would be a useful refactoring, but I see no way to squeeze it into 
2.0 - deferred
[refactoring]

Currently no plan to add this in 2.1
add delegate methods 'wizard' in 2.1
