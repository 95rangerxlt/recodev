In the case where the "Source | Override/Implement Methods..." dialog is used to
add code into a class.  Iff that class is 1.5 source code and the method
overrides a method in a parent *class* I suggest you add the "@Override" to the
method.

This could become a check item on the dialog as "Generate method comment" is today.

Apologies if someone already requested this...but a quick search turned up nil.

(BTW: 3.1 looks great!)

Nice idea.

Tobias, can you consider this ?
The current implementation uses code templates. We may adapt the template 
variable see_to_overridden to evaluate according to its context.
the code templates are only for the comment and for the method body content. We
construct the declaration (in StubUtility)
