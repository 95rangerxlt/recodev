Reopened for pending aproval to fix for 2.0.
Do we need clear.mark at all?  Emacs doesn't have this does it?

Fix is to remove binding for clear.mark.

Value: moderate - Ctrl+G for searching declarations is good for power users.
Risk: low - just removing a key binding for an action that is not needed

It turns out the emacs does use Ctrl+G to clear the mark, and that this reduces 
the risk of accidentally wiping out a large region using Ctrl+W.

We will not be changing the binding at the Workbench level.

Recommend simply removing the emacs key binding for search declarations (and 
possibly search references as well).  Moving to JDT-UI.
