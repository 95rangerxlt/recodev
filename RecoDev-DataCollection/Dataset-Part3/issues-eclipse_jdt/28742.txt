Display the hierarchy view for an open file.  Now add a breakpoint to a method 
of that file.  Note the flash in the hierarchy view.
Moving to JDT-UI. The breakpoint action has no knowledge of the hierarchy view.
Can't reproduce under Windows. Adam, do you see it under Linux. If so, please 
move PR to Martin, otherwise close.
i do see it - only on Motif
both outline and hierarchy views flash when i add/remove a breakpoint
All views showing elements from working copies are concerned:
The errortick manager listens to annotation-model changes in the editor.
Every add/remove of a annotation leads to a image update as we currently have 
no information of the annotion which changed.
Moving to jdt-text: More information in the delta would solve the problem. 
(Unfortunatly this is quite tricky to change as this is all API)
Adding my name to the cc list as we are now tracking performance issues more
closely. Please remove the performance keyword if this is not a performance bug.

bug is outdated. was fixed at least for 3.0 (probably even for 2.1.x)
