Eclipse has always has a small problem in that occaisionally it would show an
error in the editor window (red-squiggly, with a marker) even though the error
had been fixed and no longer appeared in the Tasks/Problem view. I usually just
type "Space-Backspace" and save the file and it goes away.

In 3.0, this is MUCH more frequent.  I'm not 100% sure of the cause, but every
time I've seen in it recently, file A will have a problem, and then I'll change
file B to fix it.  I'll pay more attention, and see if I can obtain any more
details.

I assume you run plain Eclipse SDK without additional plug-ins and open a *.java
file with the Java editor, right?

Is the file big? If so, it can take a while until reconcile thread has done it's
work.

If you see this problem again please check whether there's anything in .log.

Yes to all your assumptions.  The files are not particuarly big (a few hundred
lines at most).  I don't think it's a timing issue, but I'll be glad to
double-check the "progress view" if thw will help to verify.

I'll check the .log.

I saw the problem again today, but there was nothing in the log.  I'm not sure 
(unfortunately) exactly what I did/or the class relationships. 
	 
Did you refresh that file from local file system?
Is the file open in multiple workbench windows?
*** Bug 69449 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I found a bug in that area and fixed it:
- have more than one editor open (say A.java and B.java which refer to each other)
- change A so that B has an error (don't save)
- switch to B ==> error is shown
- switch back to A
- fix error (don't save)
- give focus to another application
- give focus back to Eclipse
- switch to B ==> error still shown
