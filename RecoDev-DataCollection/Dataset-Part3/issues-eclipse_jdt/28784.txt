If warnings for unused imports are enabled and a file
contains two or more unused imports, you can remove
any ONE of these imports using 'Quickfix' on the task
view's context menu.  Trying to remove a second unused
import does nothing (not even show the available fixes
dialog).  Occurs with 2.1 M3 and M4

When I tested this, the 'quick fix action awas always disabled.
Trying to fid out how the action enablement is does I can see any code that 
does the action enablement for this action (isEnabled is never called).
Moving to desktop.

Sorry, I added my comment to the wrong bug.
There is a problem with the enablement of the quick fix action, but the example 
is in bug 28655.

Moving this one back to my inbox.
