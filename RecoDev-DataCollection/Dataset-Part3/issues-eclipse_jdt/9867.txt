Methods and fields are still visible when deleting them from package-view.

I'm told it's supposed to be like this, but it results in a usability-problem
and especially when the editor is closed.

What build are you using? In 20020212 it works correctly if the editor is not
open, i.e. method goes away from Packages view.


when the editor is not open we could open so that the user sees what is going 
on, but then the deletion will only show up in the packages view after a save.

we have spent quiet some time on this but we need to revisit this given the 
user feedback. This will require additional support from the Java model (e.g. 
we force can inform that JavaModel that we want to see the working copy state 
and not the saved state, i.e., there is some support for "managed working 
copies" in JCORE) 

However, one conclusion of the investigation might be that we can't do better 
for 2.0
On question from Daniel:
I'm using build 20020125, platform linux/motif.
support for reconciling everywhere is in 20020501
