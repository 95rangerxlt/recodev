- new Java project, in existing self-hosting workspace
- in project properties, edit Java build path
- Add Variable...
- choose ECLIPSE_HOME using Variable Name's Browse button (equal to c:\eclipse)
- in Path Extension, enter: /plugins/org.eclipse.swt
- hit Path Extension's Browse button
- select swt.jar (at c:\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.swt\swt.jar)
- it sets the Path Extension to c:/eclipse/swt.jar

It should be c:\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.swt\swt.jar.

- try it also with entering only /plugins in the text field first
- it sets the Path Extension to c:/eclipse/org.eclipse.swt/swt.jar

It seems to be omitting the part which was explicitly typed in before hitting browse.

Also note that the resolved path should use the OS string.
