Open a java file and do some editing. _Without_ saving the content perform 
an "Extract Local Variable" refactoring. Afterwards perform an undo operation. 
The content of the editor gets trashed.
Do you have more information? Could not reproduce.
Tried again: the first undo reverts the effects of the refactoring, the next 
trashes the content. Will attach step by step screenshots.
