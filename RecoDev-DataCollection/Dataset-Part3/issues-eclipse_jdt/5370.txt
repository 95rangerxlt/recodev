Code complete includes fields and methods that are not code legal in the current
context. For example, code completion shows private methods defined in Object.
This not only clutters the code complete dialog with tons of useless data, it
also generates compiler errors if a user unwittingly selects a private/protected
field/method out of context.

The results of code complete should be filtered by protection and context.

CodeAssist has an option to hide non-visible member completions.
JUI should expose it.

Moving to JUI
For now set the option to hide invisible members to off.

Once we do a code assist preference this should become a user visible option.
There is now a preference for controlling visibility, the option should be off
by default
