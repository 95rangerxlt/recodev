When i select a working set then i can't expand a java compilation unit
in the tree When the file is loaded in an editor!

I can expand a Java tree item when the java file is not in an editor when i 
double click on it to load the tree of the java file collapse and i can't 
expand any more (no [+])

It works when the working set contains projects/packages, but it doesn't work 
when the working set contains Compilation units (e.g. 
junit.framework.TestCase.java).
You can expand TestCase.java when it isn't opened in the editor, once it is 
opened and you click plus then it is gone. I suspect that the working set 
filter doesn't know about working copy elements and hence filters out the 
children of a CU.

Interestingly the problem also shows up when reconciling is turned off.
Tested against 20020514 and it worked.
Have to ask EG about exact steps.

Could reproduce with 20020508.
It seems to be fixed in 20020514. The bug was probably caused by the underlying
infrastructure.

Setting target to M6
