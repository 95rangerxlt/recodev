Enter the text (including the trailing space) 'Foo.xy ' into the body of a 
method in an Eclipse .java editor.  After the trailing space, press Ctrl+Space 
for Code Assist.  The only option it will offer is 'xy - Foo.xy'.  I don't even 
have a class named Foo, and it probably wouldn't have an 'xy' field even it did 
exist.

This choice of option seems completely arbitrary, and I can't imagine it ever 
being useful.

The only text which would be synactically correct in this spot would, I 
believe,  be an operator, a semicolon or a comment.

This is a variable name suggestion, but it should only be triggered if the 
declaring class is defined.

David - a binding check would make sense here.
