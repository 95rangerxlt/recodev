If i do ctrl-shift-u on a identifier i get a list of lines in the search view where those are found.
But the line numbers that are reported are 1 off. It does jump to the right line but it is funny to see that the search view reports "203:" and the actual code is according to the line of the ruler is on  204

It seems that the search view reports 0 based but the line number ruler starts with 1
