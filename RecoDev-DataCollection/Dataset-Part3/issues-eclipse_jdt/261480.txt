HEAD

Settings: Default + Insert common prefixes... + Insert best guessed arguments

- have:

package p;
public class C {
        void m() {
                new Vecto|
        }
}

- put caret at |
- Ctrl+Space

=> changes line to
		new java.util.Vector|

=> expected:
		new Vector|
or
		new Vector(|);
and content assist for constructor proposals.

I would always favor constructor proposals over explicit qualification proposals after "new xxx".
