3.3

There was no uncaught exception and the refactoring asked if instead RuntimeException should be caught. It could instead revert to the template's behaviour and leave the selection on the exception type.

Always ending in linked mode with the selection on the exception type and the catch clause as the exit point might be an additional improvement.
