We changed that behaviour some time because many people felt that using the
editor's project as the "current" project was the right thing to do. This works
as intented.
I read this a little fast. the problem is that the title is wrong, the scope is
actually ok.
We were always calculating the scope description based on the selected elements.
Fixed.
