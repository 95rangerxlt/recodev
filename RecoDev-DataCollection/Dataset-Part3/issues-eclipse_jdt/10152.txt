Computing the hierarchy of IResource can take more than 30s.
75% of the time is spent getting the potential subtypes from the indexes.
The recursive call to the SuperTypeReferencePattern to find possible subtypes 
was the bottleneck. It was querying all indexes in the workspace for each 
subtype.

Querying all potential subtypes at once (and caching the result) reduced the 
time spent getting the potential subtypes to less than a second.
