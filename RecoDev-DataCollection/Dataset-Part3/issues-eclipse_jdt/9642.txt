In a self-hosting workspace, with project org.eclipse.core.resources closed, 
searches for references to 'org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource' using the 
Java search page.

No inaccurate match is found inside JavaSearchScope.add(IJavaElement) where 2 
should have been found (by variable declaration type simple name).
Simpler test case:

Define:

class X {
  {
    Zork[] zork = new Zork[0];
  }
}

Search (using Java search page) for references to type 'Zork':
It doesn't find the missing variable type.

NOTE: if searching for 'p.Zork', it finds nothing.

In both cases, I would expect 2 inacurrate matches.
In the first test case (i.e. searching for 'Zork'), the search pattern was case 
insensitive, but we used CharOperation.equals(char[], char[]) to compare the 
type ref and the simple name

In the second test case (i.e. searchin for 'p.Zork'), the problem reference 
binding was treated as a regular binding, and since it would return an empty 
qualification, we rejected it.
