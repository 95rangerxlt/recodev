If a field without modifier(public,private,protected) already has javadoc
information when we try to encapsulate it the javadoc appears between the
private and the return type of the method.

Eg:
Before encapsulate field:

/**
 * field x
 */
 int x;

After encapsulate field:
private /**
 * field x
 */
 int x;

It should be:

/**
 * field x
 */
 private int x;
