We now have many quick assists and quick fixes. Some of them only appear when
the caret is at a certain position, some even only when there's some specific
selection. It would be good to have a list with all the quick fixes/assist telling:
- what they do
- when they are available

This list should always be up-to-date (i.e. not help which might get updated at
the end of 3.1 dev cycle) similar to pressing Ctrl+Shift+L which gives me all
key bindings for my editor.

I agree that we have to find a solution for this. Maybe help is the right place
for this - it should just be updated.

It's difficult to come up with a lightweight table that shows all the necessary
preconditions for each quick assist. Preconditions are checked in code, and
sometimes heavily rely on the invocation context. I don't think this can be
described accurately in just a few words.
With "when they are available" I'm already happy if I know where to set the
caret position / selection in order to have a change to get the quick fix/assist.
that got added in 3.1 (in user.doc)
I would have expected to see this in the reference section and not in the 
Concepts chapter.

In addition I would add a link to it from the editor's F1 help. Agree?
F1 where

If in concepts or reference can be discussed (me, Tobias and Tom had the discussion). I also think references would be better.
However, this isn't the issue of this bug, we have a list, so I consider this one fixed. File a specific bug where F1 should show you all the quick fixes.
Ah, sorry - forgot - never open one of Martin's closed bug ;-)
Yes, exactly. Feel free to add comments I'll gladly reconsider an open the bug again :-)
But here you just opened it for a different request. Veery baaad.
