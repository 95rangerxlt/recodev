Using I200412142000

On the following class:
public class GenericClass<T> {
	public void foo(List<?> list) {
	}
	
	public void bar(List<Integer> list) {
		
	}
}

Extract interface leads to the following result:
public interface IGenClass<T> {
	public abstract void foo(List< ? > list);

	public abstract void bar(List<Integer> list);
}

Where spaces appear before and after the ?-wildcard.
