i love the smart semicolon feature, and i think it could be improved in strings

when i'm in the middle of a string, pressing ; inserts ; (fine)
i'd like to have a way to force the smartness here - i.e. force inserting the
semicolon at the end of the line. (maybe by holding the ctrl key)

for me, semicolons in strings are extremally rare and i get annoyed everytime i
have to first exit the string to be able to use the semicolon smartness.

it could be the other way: i.e. - normal case = 'smartness', add way to force
'dumness' (raw mode)

We used to handle strings like normal code, i.e. jump to predicted end of 
statement. Several people didn't like at that way and comlained bitterly. 
It depends what your doing at the moment. It thought "arrghh" several times with
both behaviors. However, I'd agree with Adam that the semicolon inside the
string is not the 80% case.

What about if smart and dumb semi-colon's were actions bindable to keys? That 
way everyone could decide for themselves how to bind them!
I think a switch to non-smart action for the next text editor action would help
here and in some other areas where you know that typing the next character
should not be smart.
In order to find the best solution, we'll provide two Insert Semicolon actions.
We can then experiment with different key bindings and later on settle on a
solution.
Moving to M7.
Changing milestone to M9.
smart semicolon is now enabled in strings, too. backspace following a smart
semicolon (or brace) insertion will take you back where you were when pressing
semicolon.
