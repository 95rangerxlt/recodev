Build: I20030710

Start writing a setter method, like this:

public void setValue(int i) {}

Then position cursor between the braces and fill in the method body.  You end up
with this:

public void setValue(int i) {this.value=i};

Problem: when you type the semicolon, it jumps over the closing method body
brace and places it at the end of the line, resulting in a syntax error.
