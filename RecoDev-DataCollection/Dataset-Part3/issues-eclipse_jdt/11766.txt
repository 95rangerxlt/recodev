Users might not understand why some options are grayed out. Especially if I
write my own doclet. I suggest to either
- open the API so that doclet providers can access the options i.e. enable them
if they use/honor an option
- or put all options for the standard doclet on a "Standard Doclet Options" page
which is not shown for the custom doclet.

we should support having a UI per doclet. This means we define an extension 
point so that doclet specific export pages can be contributed.

The user would select the doclet to be used on the first page.

The wizard now has three pages. The middle page is dedicated to options for the 
standard doclet and thus does not appear when the custom doclet option is 
selected. fixed. JRT.
