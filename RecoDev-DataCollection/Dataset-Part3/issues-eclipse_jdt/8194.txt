Critical since buttons are cut off.

The layout of the buttons need to be fixed, they should be vertically centered 
relative to the table.

The labels should just be "Translate" "Never Translate" and "Skip"
i did not see buttons cut off - a label was and it's fixed now
also fixed are mnemonics and button labels
Problem is fixed on my machine. I have Windows NT using Windows Standard and
small fonts. Screen resolution is 1280x1024


Please note that for Eclipse to pass it's accessibility review it must be 
usable on extra large and high contrast settings.
it looks like the externalize strings dialog takes on the height of full screen
i removed the hard-coded minimal wizard size from refactoring dialog 
(which is nls dialog as well)
