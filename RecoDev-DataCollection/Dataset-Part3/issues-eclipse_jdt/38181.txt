1) execute a "use supertype where possible" refactoring in a case where no 
supertypes can be used.
->end up with an empty dialog with no indication that no super types can be 
used.

We should show the user that no supertype could be used in the dialog.

can you provide a test case? i always see at least Object in the list
yes, you always see Object as a supertype candidate. The problem is that when 
the refactoring cannot use this supertype anywhere and I don't go through the 
preview I have no indication that nothing changed.
this is a general issue - when you press 'Preview' you see a message set in 
PreviewWizardPage.NullPreviewer

however, when you press OK, no message is displayed in such case
asking Dirk for comment since this is a more general framework problem
we might want to consider this scenario when making this stuff API
Adam, waht do you expect to happen. Pressing OK means executing the 
refactoring no showing the preview page. So how should the framework know that 
is should show the preview ?
i guess it's the same problem like with an empty change - something should be 
shown but

Erich - what would be you expectation? a message dialog?
ok, agreed to do sth in my land
a message dialog would be OK by me.


fixed - the wizard stays on the same page, in case there's another type to 
choose
if there's none, then ok and preview remain disabled
