When creating a new projet on an existing directory containing sub-directories 
with Java files, it would be interesting that source folders are automatically 
computed.
Source folders would be computed using the following algorithm :
- search sub-directories containing .java files
- read one java file on each directory and look for its package definition
- set directories containing packages as Source folders

Eclipse user would be able to run this computation from the Java Build setting 
dialog.

When creating a project with an external location pointing to an existing 
folder, the wizard now prompts you before going to the Java page to ask if an 
existing classpath should be detected.
