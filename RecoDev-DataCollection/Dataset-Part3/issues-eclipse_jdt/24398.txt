Verified fixed in build 20021016
This is not completely fixed:
In a structure 
Project1
  folder1
    file1

-Create a working set and select file1.
->Project1 and folder1 are gray checked
-Collapse folder1
-Uncheck Project1
->No items are checked yet the finish button is still enabled. If you close the 
edit dialog and reopen you will get an error message indicating that no items 
are checked.

I fixed this for the ResourceWorkingSetPage. See bug 24397.
The current implementation is due to performance problems when clicking  in the
UI (it took almost a minute with very large workspaces in slow machines).

Your fix will surface those problems again.

I have fixed the problem you report here by changing the validation mechanism
(see JavaWorkingSetPage.validateInput in JDT UI HEAD.


Performance could only be a problem when a large number of items are checked or 
gray checked because I now recursively uncheck children when an item is 
unchecked. I tried this with all children of org.eclipse.ui.workbench and 
performance is not a problem. Perhaps this would be different when working with 
Java elements.
There was a different problem with my fix which I corrected. Your fix is nice 
because it's simple. However, I'll keep mine for the time being unless it 
causes problems.
