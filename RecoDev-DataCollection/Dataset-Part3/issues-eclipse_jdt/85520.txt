I turned on working sets in the packages explorer. I have a Team working set 
and a few other projects that appear by default in the Other Projects working 
set. I can drag a project from my Team working set to the History or from 
Other Projects to History. I can drag from History to Team but I cannot drag 
from either History or Team to Other Projects. In order to get a projetc back 
into other projects, I need to put it it Team and then edit the working set 
and remove it. I think you shoudl be able to drag projects into the Other 
Projects working set.

Also, what is the History working set for? I noticed that when I do certain 
things (e.g. Refactor/Rename a project, a plus appears beside the History 
entry but it never contains anything).

A File goes into the history working set as soon as you save it. This gives you
a quick access to the history of the edited/saved files.

You can remove something from a working set simply by using the action form the
context menu ('Remove from working set').

I will look into allowing DnD onto the Others Projects working set.
Please note that the history working set got removed for M6. 

Fixed DnD to the Others Project working set for M6.
