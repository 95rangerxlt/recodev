Headless building with APT in Eclipse refers to the old startup.jar which no longer exists.  This should instead refer to org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.

That's one for you Walter.
*** Bug 191127 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
In the topic on running the Java Formatter, it just uses "eclipse -application [etc.]".  Can we just do that?  (Do we still need to invoke with java -jar [etc.]"?)
 can't say for sure, because I don't know why you were using "java -jar" in the first place.  Using "eclipse -application <etc>" is definitely a better way to go. 

The only reason I can think of for invoking Java directly is if you want to pipe stdout /stderr to a file on Windows, or you are running on a platform that does not have a native launcher. If you didn't have a special reason for invoking java -jar, I suggest invoking the eclipse executable with -application, etc. 
Consensus at this end is that the only reason we were ever using java -jar [etc.] is because we saw someone else doing it :-)

I'll change it to be "eclipse".

Here's my proposed version, getting rid of -noupdate and using eclipse instead of the launcher jar.
Now that you changed it to eclipse, instead of java -jar, you might want to add -nosplash.

I added -nosplash and also changed to eclipsec, because with eclipse it runs asynchronously which seems like a bad idea for something that someone would probably be using inside a command script.
This fix made it into 3.3.
