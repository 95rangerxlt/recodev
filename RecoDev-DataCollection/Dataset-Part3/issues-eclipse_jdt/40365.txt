Testpass 20030716 + plugin-export I20030716.from20030717_1019

1. Have this code: 
/**
 * 
 * 
 * 
 */
public class NewTest {
	public int foo() {
		return 0;
	}
}

class Tester {
	NewTest two;
}

2. Select NewTest, choose Refactor->Extract Interface
3. Choose name, check "replace where possible", select method foo, press "Preview"
4. In the preview, drill down into the changes to NewTest.java
- "Delete elements from NewTest.java" does not make sense - nothing gets
deleted, only an "implemented" clause added.
- The source range shown for "Delete elements ..." is wrong
