InterfaceMethodTests uses two excuses from JavacHasABug, where the bug has been fixed meanwhile:
- Javac8AcceptsDefaultMethodInAnnotationType
- Javac8ProducesIllegalAccessError

Since the bug was in unreleased EA versions, I believe we should simply remove these excuses.

Additionally, testBug421543b() shows a warning (re missing @Override) only from ecj, not from javac. This situation should simply be avoided.
