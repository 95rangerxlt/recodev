1. Filter out libraries in the packages view
	2. Select "Goto type..."
	3. Select a type which is in a library (e.g. Object)
	==> nothing happens

	Either
	- warn the user that the filter is on
	- add the library and select object
	- filter out classes in libraries with the same filter as the package view

	Same applies to the "Show in packages view" action on a type.

agree, this is a severe usability issue.

Options:
* show a dialog and prompt the user whether filters should be removed. 

* only show visible types in the Go To type dialog

I prefer the second proposal (restrict Go To Type dialog).

Reminder: Same problem now also applies to working sets.

Still a problem in I200202026.
The bug is related to "Show in packages view" problems:
3754: Show in packages view does not work (1GEME0T)


we now show a dialog
