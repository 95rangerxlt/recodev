Given:
package p;
public class E {
	public int field;
}

package p;
public class Test {
	public void foo() {
		E e = new E();
		if (e.field ++ > 0)
			System.out.println();
	}
}

1. Select E
2. Extract Class
3. Generate Getter/Setters
4. OK
5. Convert even node can not be converted
Is:
if (.field ++ > 0)
Should:
if (e.field ++ > 0)

Karsten can you try to fix please?
