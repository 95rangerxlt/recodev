I have:
class A
class B extends A
class C extends B

I want to pull up a method in class C to class B. In this method, a PROTECTED 
method in class A is called.

When pulling up, I receive in the dialog box of Found problems, the not 
applicable problem:
Method 'void fail(String rrn, String cause)' referenced in one of the pulled 
elements is not accessible from type 'B'
fail is the PROTECTED method in class A.

Markus, can you please investigate.
Fixed in HEAD for PullUp and PushDown.
