I20030106, Win2K, Linux-GTK

Run a class as JUnit Application.  Make sure the test class has some tests that 
will fail.  

After the run is complete, the number of failures listed at the top of the 
JUnit window is less than the actual number of failures (i.e., the failures 
listed in the list portion of the JUnit window).  For example, in my case 4 
items are listed in the list, but # of Failures is tagged as 2.
