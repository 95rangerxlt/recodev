In Java code, what does the following warning mean, how would I fix it and
why should I care:

Access to enclosing method aMethodName(...) from the type aTypeName is
emulated by a synthetic accessor method.

Thank you,
Gary

Martin, could we provide a quick fix for this?
Philippe, could we improve the message?

Could you give a quick example here as well? I cannot get rid of the warning no 
matter how I fiddle with my code.

Thanks,
Gary
The fix is to change the method visibility to non-private.

Please suggest a better message.
I think the message is fine. Dani, suggestion?
The message sounds like an info instead of a warning/error.
I would *add* something like "The additional method invocation reduces performance."
