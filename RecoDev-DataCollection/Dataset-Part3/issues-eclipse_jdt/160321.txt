When the cursor in the java editor is placed 

- after whitespace
- after closing / of javadoc
- after ;
- at beginning of line

(and maybe other places) and ctrl-shift-M is given to do an Add Import, a dialog box appears with the message "0".

In contrast, when the cursor is placed on some non-type text (for example 'int'), a error message "No type 'int' found.' is displayed in the statusbar.

The message in the dialog should be more precise, and maybe displayed in the stausbar (or the message in the statusbar should be displayed in a dialogbox).
