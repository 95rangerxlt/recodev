		Removing the two lines that reports the problem is the binding 
is NullBinding is good enough to fix the PR:

	Replace this method inside ThrowStatement with the following code:

[	public void resolve(BlockScope scope) {
		exceptionType = exception.resolveTypeExpecting(scope, 
scope.getJavaLangThrowable());
		exception.implicitWidening(exceptionType, exceptionType);
	}]

Changed the type resolution code to allow it if 1.4 compliant.
Fixed
