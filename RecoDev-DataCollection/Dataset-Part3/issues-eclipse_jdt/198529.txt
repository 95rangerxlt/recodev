I just noticed that the Java colored label decorations have been turned on by default (actually, I didn't even know they existed until now). Regardless of whether you think it is a good idea or not (I like it), we need to be consistent. That is, it is bad that some views, like the Packages Explorer and Projects view in the Java Browsing perspective, use the colors while others, like the Project Explorer and Navigator, do not. More specifically, this setting should be a Platform setting and not a Java setting.

I'm not sure if the default enablement is a bug or a feature: Bug 198637

But I agree, colored labels is Martin land. He'll be back in 10 days. The preference is only one step, also some infrastructure for colored labels is planed to be pushed down to platform in 3.4. See also bug 188333
The colored labels infrastructure and preferences are now down in Platform/UI. The project explorer also shows colored labels. The Open Resource dialog has a patch waiting.

I would suggest to file separate against views that could profit from colors. Adding colors is normally quite easy possible.
