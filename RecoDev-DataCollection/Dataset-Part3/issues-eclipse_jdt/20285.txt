build F3

1) Create a Java project and a package called Aaa
2) Create a HelloWorld class with the non-externalized string "Hello!"
3) Select the class, Source->Externalize Strings...
4) Mark "Hello!" as "Never Translate" and press Next
5) Note that the finish button is disable and the error message says that 
packages cannot start with a capital letter
6) If you change the package to be aaa it complains it does not exist (works 
as expected).

Suggestion is that (5) be a warning instead of an error and do not disable the 
button (this is the behaviour in the create package wizard).

We should doc it in the readme file. A workaround is <g>:

- rename package to be lower case letter
- externalize strings
- rename it back

agree with Dirk. In addition uper case package names are against common 
conventions and should be rare
We should make it a warning.
fixed for 2.1
