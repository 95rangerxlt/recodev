Hyperlink navigation doesn't highlight correctly.  It will randomly highlight
the method name in the method signature, but generally is off to the left.  

This seems to have been broken sometime between 3.0M3 and Version: 3.0.0 Build
id: 200310090010, which is what I am currently using.

It works correctly on the Linux-GTK version with a Build id:200310060010.

Steve the OS for this bug is WinXP but in your comment you mention Linux-GTK, so
my questions:
- is the problem on WinXP or Linux-GTK?
- can you give an example file where you this problem can be seen?
The problem occurs on WinXP, but NOT on Linux-GTK.

I'll work on supplying an example file.
I can't reproduce using 3.0 M4. Are you clicking on types with special
characters in their names or do you see this with all types? Did you change
something in the preferences (line number ruler, layout,...) that could cause
this, in other words please try if you see this with a fresh 3.0 M4 install.
Seems to work fine with 3.0M4, so it must have been fixed.  Thanks.
