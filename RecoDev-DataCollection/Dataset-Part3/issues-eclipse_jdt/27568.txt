Build 20021127 (last integration):


Start with:


public class Test {


    public static void main(String[] args) {


        System.out.println("Testing");


        test.out.println("Alfa");


    }


}




Select "System" press Ctrl-C to copy to clipboard, then select "test" and press 
Ctrl-V to paste.




Here is the result (with _ for the cursor).


public class Test {


    public static void main(String[] args) {


        System.out.println("Testing");


            System.o_ut.println("Alfa");


    }


}


The cursor should be positioned before the . character, and indentation should 
not be changed.


If the smart paste is disabled there is no problem.

moving to TEXT
The problem has been solved. However, there is now a new problem:
  aaaa()
  bbbbbbbbbb=ccccccc
Selecting aaaa and replacing bbbbbbbbbb with aaaa results in aaaacccccc.
