proposed fix
I don't quite understand why the patch is not symmetric (i.e. it has 
"&& start.getLocationInParent() == IfStatement.ELSE_STATEMENT_PROPERTY", but not
"&& start.getLocationInParent() == IfStatement.THEN_STATEMENT_PROPERTY").

Since nothing bad happens and the effects of the change are not 100% clear to me, I think we should postpone to 3.3.

There is no semetric stmt because this is exactly the case we have to prevent:

if (a) {
 if (b) {
  ;
 } else if (c) {
  ;
 }
}

When we are at 'if (c)' then its location in parent is ELSE_PROPERTY, so we go to the parent, which is 'if (b)'. When we are at 'if (b)' its location is THEN_PROPERTY, so we don't go to the parent, because 'if (a)' belongs to another if-then-else sequence.
