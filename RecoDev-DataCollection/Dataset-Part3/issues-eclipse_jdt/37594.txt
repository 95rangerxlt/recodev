When you get the compiler warning stating that you have a local variable in a 
method which is over-riding a field in your class, I would like to have the 
QuickFix option to rename the local variable and all its occurences in the 
method.

Note that you Quick Assist already offers the rename (Set the cursor to the
reference, press CTRL + 1).
I will put this assist as proposal for the error.
