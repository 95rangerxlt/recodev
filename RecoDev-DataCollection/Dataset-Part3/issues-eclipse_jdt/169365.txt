There have been some improvements to the API to support element comparisons. I will attach a patch to JDT/UI that adopts these changes.

Patch to JDT/UI

Here is the patch. This patch updates the existing Compare/Replace actions and also adds the ability to have the History view show the history of selected Java elements (e.g. methods). I'll leave it up to JDT/UI to decide whether they want to adopt this approach. If you do, no changes are necessary. If you don;t, then you'll need to change the USE_MODAL boolean to true in the Compare action and you'll also want to remove the history page source adapter factory.
Thanks Michael. I'll release after the nex I-build as new team API is required, ok?
That's fine.
