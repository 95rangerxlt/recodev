We initialize the search engine with a set of working copies for a particular 
buffer factory. There is currently no API to retrieve all shared working copies 
and JDT UI has to maintain its own registry which duplicates the JavaCore 
provided working set support. Suggest to add JavaCore.getSharedWorkingCopies
(IBufferFactory factory).

If publishing your buffer factory as API, then this suggested API might find 
more working copies than you'd expect ? Isn't it better to actually remember 
the ones which matter to you instead (as you currently do) ?
When a client creates a shared working copy using our buffer factory then it 
should participate in our search. In addition, we would like to get rid of our 
own private registry which can result in inconsistencies.
Added JavaCore#getSharedWorkingCopies(IBufferFactory)

Fixed
