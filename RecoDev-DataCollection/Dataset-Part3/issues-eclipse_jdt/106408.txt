The apt implementation of AnnotationProcessorEnvironment.getOptions() adds 
certain items in addition to the -A keys.  We should include as many of these 
as are relevant to Eclipse.  Here's the apt behavior:

1. convert "-cp", if present, to "-classpath".  (If both are present, use 
whichever one comes last.) 2. add "-target=1.5"
3. add "save-parameter-names" (with null value).  Googling for this key reveals 
nothing.
4. add any -A parameters, with the well-known bug that they are added as [key 
= "-Akey=val", val = null] rather than being parsed.
5. ignore any -J options.
6. add any other valid command line options, parsed as would be expected but 
with the dash included in the key name (e.g., [key="-d", val="c:/src"].  
(AFAICT options -print and -help cause annotation processors not to be called, 
so they never show up in the env.)

The Eclipse contents should be:

 -classpath / [classpath]
 -s / [generated src dir]
 -d / [bin dir]
 -target / [target version]
 -source / [source version]

And the -A options, processed as they currently are (that is, presented both in 
Sun style and in sane style).

When there are automatic values, I think they should take precedence over 
manually passed-in values.  (E.g., even if someone sets -A-classpath=foo, that 
should be ignored and the actual classpath should be presented to the 
processor.  This could be argued either way, though; there's an argument for 
giving people override capability to fix weird problems, and an argument for 
telling the truth and thereby avoiding the likelihood of weird problems.

I think we should *not* include "save-parameter-names" since I don't know what 
it means.

I don't think there are any other options that can be set in Eclipse and that 
would be relevant to processors.
Need -sourcepath as well, as this is supported by apt via its wrapper around
javac. It's not obviously documented, but does work.
We now automatically set:
 -classpath / [classpath]
 -sourcepath / [source path]
 -s / [generated source dir]
 -d / [binary output dir]
 -target / [target JVM version]
 -source / [source Java version]
