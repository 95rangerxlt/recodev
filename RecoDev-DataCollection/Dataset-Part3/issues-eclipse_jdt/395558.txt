Steps to reproduce:
1. Invoke "Introduce Parameter Object" on 't' in code below
2. Choose "Destination" as "Nested class in IntroduceParameterObjectBug1"
3. There is a compilation error in the resulting file ("Cannot make a static reference to the non-static type T")

interface IntroduceParameterObjectBug1<T> {
    // Invoke "Introduce Parameter Object" on 't', choose "Destination" as
    // "Nested class in IntroduceParameterObjectBug1"
    void f(T t);
}

(Thanks to Yilong Li for helping with the bug reports.)

Probably related to bug 394549.

Thanks for the patch. The patch fixes the current bug and bug 395561. Few minor points:
1. Since the fix is also for bug 395561, add a testcase for the mentioned scenario.
2. Update copyright year to 2013 in IntroduceParameterObjectTests and ParameterObjectFactory.
3. Code Formatting, there should be a space after '=' in line no: 198 of ParameterObjectFactory. You can have a look at http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_UI/How_to_Contribute #Coding Conventions to get comfortable with the guidelines.

Thanks for the patch. Released the fix as: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=d14c0500c89b4a44ced2a17af2bd3ae1a4fe7de2

Have a look at ParameterObjectFactory to see how to update the copyright year. The first year stands for when the file was created and the second year stands for the last modified year, hence "Copyright (c) 2007, 2013...".
