Build 20011219 + JDTCORE official patch 

After importing all plugin projects in a fresh new workspace (using the pde 
import tool), org.eclipse.ui does not have correct project references  (it 
actually has none).

It does not matter whether importing in source/binary form.

Build 20011219 + JDTCORE official patch 

After importing all plugin projects in a fresh new workspace (using the pde

It does not matter whether importing in source/binary form.
Seems it can occur if at some point the classpath is set in a mode where 
resources cannot be touched. From there on, project references maybe left 
inconsistent since further opening of the buildpath wizard (and no change is 
performed, just press ok) will be optimized out (thought that the classpath is 
not actually changed).

Fixed
