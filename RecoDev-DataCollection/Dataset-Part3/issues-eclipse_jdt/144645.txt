Dani, can you tell me exactly which docs you're talking about?

The API javadoc for both apt and jdt seems to use the default stylesheet generated by the standard doclet.  I don't see any visual difference between the two, although it's possible that the 1.4 and 1.5 stylesheets are different.

The "guide" documentation (there are only two pages related to APT) has a different stylesheet - JDT uses ../book.css while APT doesn't have a sheet specified - but the only difference I see on my screen is that the header fonts are different.  I can certainly fix those pages, but I want to be sure that's what you're talking about.  Thanks!
Sorry about not being more precise - I was talking about the two pages that you manually wrote in the Programmer's Guide > JDT Annotation Processing.

You should check in a build (Help > Help Contents) whether your documentation looks right since it might appear differently than when just opening the HTML file  or might not even be present because it wasn't put into the build. 

I've fixed the two pages.
