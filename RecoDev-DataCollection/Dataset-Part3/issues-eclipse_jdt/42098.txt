M3 3.0 test pass

1. Have this code:

public class Clazz {

	public Clazz(String string<cursor>) {
	}

}

2. Press Ctrl+1, choose "assign parameter to new field"

Note: 
- the choices offered show up twice each
- the linked positions are all messed up:
  - the first stop will not be visited any more (problem with linked iteration,
I know...)
  - if I change the name of the field, it is not changed in all spots
  - the linked position for the parameter name has zero length

tom, it seems to me that bug in in the linked mode manager. I'm setting 3
positions, all with correct length (did not see the zero length)

will remove the duplicated proposal
fixed duplicated proposals > M3

validated again:
LinkedPositionManager is set up with the correct positions.
Moving to text
not for M3.

> - the choices offered show up twice each

fixed, see comment 2

As said. This is still TBD, see bug 39683.

>   - if I change the name of the field, it is not changed in all spots

fixed, problem in ProposalPosition.equals() (not committed yet)

>   - the linked position for the parameter name has zero length

mistaken - I thought there was another linked position to change the parameter
name, but it is just the exit position.


Closing as two of the items are fixed, the third is a duplicate of bug 39683,
and the fourth is mistaken.

Fixed >= 20030829
