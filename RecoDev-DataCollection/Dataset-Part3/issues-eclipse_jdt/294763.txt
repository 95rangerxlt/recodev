Dear JDT,
Would it be possible to have just one scrollbar on this page?
Fixed in HEAD.

We set the preferred height in ProblemSeveritiesConfigurationBlock.createContents(Composite), but PreferenceDialog.showPage(IPreferenceNode) threats this as the minimum size. The fix is intialize the page with a very small size in ProblemSeveritiesPreferencePage.
oh! actually I was having very similar problem with my own preference page and was curious how would others tackle it :-) thanks Markus

Copying over from bug 321693 comment 5 : we only need to set a small height to avoid 2 scroll bars. The width can be computed based on the content.

The small height can be set in the overridden computeSize() method
public Point computeSize() {
	Point size= super.computeSize();
	size.y= 10;
	return size;
}
