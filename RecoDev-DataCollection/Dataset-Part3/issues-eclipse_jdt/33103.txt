There are references to non-externalized names in JDT which show up in the 
pulldown for the PackageExplorer.

They appear to be in:

PackagesView.java - org.eclipse.jdt.ui/src-
jdt/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/browsing 
LayoutActionGroup.java - org.eclipse.jdt.ui/src-
jdt/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/ui/packageview

Tod,

can you give me a hint about the problem in the PackagesView. I did find a 
problem in the LayoutActionGroup but not in the PackagesView.
It is this line in fillActionBars that should be checked out:

IContributionItem groupMarker= new GroupMarker("Layout"); //$NON-NLS-1$
IMO this is not a problem since the group marker name never appears in the UI. 
The id is used as a key to add something to the group.
Agreed - it showed up in my search so I just thought you should double check.
