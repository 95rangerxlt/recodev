Completion of a method of a variable who's type has not been imported could
reposition cursor at required type declaration, prompt for import and reposition
at original autocomplete point, finally prompting for method completion, as
originally intended.

This would save quite a bit of time hunting back for undeclared, importing and
resuming. 

I've created a vnc movie of that leading up to this feature request:
http://benow.ca/misc/typeaddonaccess.gz
which, when decompressed, can be played back with vncrec:
gzip -d typeaddonaccess.vnc.gz; vncrec -play typeaddonaccess.vnc.gz

I get the following when accessing the file:

Not Found

The requested URL /misc/typeaddonaccess.gz was not found on this server.
Apache/2.0.51 (Gentoo/Linux) mod_ssl/2.0.51 OpenSSL/0.9.7d PHP/4.3.9 Server at

sorry, url should have been:
http://benow.ca/misc/typeaddonaccess.vnc.gz

Is vncrec free? I don't have it.
yeah, tho it's linux only, relatively unused and probably not installed by
default.  I've since figured out how to record to swf, which is a bit friendlier:

http://benow.ca/misc/typeaddonaccess.swf


Good idea!
Thanks for providing the movie. Explains things much quicker than long comments.
This is now in.
