Build F2

1. Create a class
2. Add a field with getter and setter
3. Select the field
4. Generate Getter and Setter
==> dialog (see picture) shows up which talks about the type having no fields or
all getters and setters already generated. This is confusing for the user who
only wanted to generate getters and setters for one existing field. The message
should be something like: Getters and setters for field "name goes here" already
exist.
