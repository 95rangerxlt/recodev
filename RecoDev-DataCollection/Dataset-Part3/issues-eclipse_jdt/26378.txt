Using 1114, I found a problem using the paste operation in an java editor.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Copy a piece of code
2) Select another piece of code
3) Paste the one you copied
4) You should get characters at the end of the code you pasted which belong to
the preivous code.

This is a new problem. I never encountered it before.

you don't have to select another piece of code.

i always get an extra TAB in front of the code that i paste

for example:

public class Test
{
// some code
}

and i select the complete line "public class Test"
and go one below that line i paste it again i always get this:

public class Test
    public class Test
{
// some code
}

and it doesn't have anything to do with a complete line because if i only 
copy "class" and want to put that on a new line i get this:

public class Test
    class
{
// some code
}

for me this is a showstopper for the M3 release!!
I agree that this is really bad, because in my case I use copy/paste a lot and 
this is very disturbing.
