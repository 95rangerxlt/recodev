In smart insert mode it is not possible to insert a semicolon into a string. 
You have to explicitly toggle the mode. This is frustrating since there is no 
affordance or clue for how to toggle the mode. This means to insert a 
semicolon when the typing preference is enabled I have to know about 
the "insert" key toggle mechanism. This needs an additional clue (e.g. in the 
preference page, when the cursor jumps inside a string etc.).

To avoid this frustration all together the semicolon should be inserted into 
the string directly. This is consistent with the way semicolon is handled in 
comments.

In addition, when using the sysout template there already is a semicolon 
inserted and the user doesn't even have to enter one. To smartness isn't 
needed.
