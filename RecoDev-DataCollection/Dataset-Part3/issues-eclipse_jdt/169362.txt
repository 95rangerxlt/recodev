Build ID: I20060810-1230

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open some existing Java file in a Java editor, and trigger an autocomplete popup, for example, by typing "return get", and pressing CTRL-SPACE, to see a list of getters.
2. While the pop-up is still being displayed, press CTRL-O to attempt to open the quick-outline. The quick-outline does not actually show up.
3. Dismiss the autocomplete popup by clicking somewhere else.
4. Try the shortcuts CTRL-O for quickoutline, CTRL-SHIFT-F to format the code, etc. They will no longer work.
5. Close and reopen the Java file (doesn't matter whether you save the changes). The shortcut keys CTRL-O and CTRL-SHIFT-F will work again.

This is broken since day one except that in 3.0 and earlier you have to give the focus to the completion proposal window (e.g. by pressing Tab).
Fixed in HEAD.
