Type this text :

	public void init ()
	{
		put ();
	}
	}

Now, add "" between the () near the put. You will obtain this :

	public void init ()
	{
		put ("");
	}
	}

Now, go under for deleting the "}" and press backspace.

The "}" is not deleting, but the "" will desappears !

That's all.

I'm available for giving more information.
