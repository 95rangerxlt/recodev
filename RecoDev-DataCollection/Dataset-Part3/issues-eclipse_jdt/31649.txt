All uix fix/assist proposals have a descriptive label
'Remove xx', 'Change to..'

The surround template proposals should follow this rule as well.
e.g.
'Surround with {0} template'

We discussed this already.
Those are quick templates. Never use two different names/icons for the same
thing  - that's a UI rule.

Either remove the surround feature from the quick fix key, or change the name 
to be compatible with quick assists.

Push the bug report to me if you don't have time for it.
Moving to MA - still consider it a bug to use different labels for same thing
