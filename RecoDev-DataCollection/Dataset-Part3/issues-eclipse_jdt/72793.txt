Fixed for I20040831. We didn't handle qualified field accesses.

Test case:

public class WriteAccess {
	class Record {
		int fNum= 17;
		void inc() {
			Record.this.fNum=
				this.fNum + 1;
		}
	}
	
	Record fRecord= new Record();
	
	int read() {
		return fRecord.fNum;
	}
	
	void write() {
		fRecord.fNum= -1;
		fRecord.fNum++;
		--fRecord.fNum;
	}
}
