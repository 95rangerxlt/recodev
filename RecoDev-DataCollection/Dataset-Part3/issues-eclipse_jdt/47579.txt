Unlike the Members View, you cannnot hide package declaration nodes and import
nodes in Outline View, which is a bit of a pain IMHO.

My suggestion is to provide the same drop down filter menu on the Outline view bar 
as exists on the Members View. Thank you.

Version 3.0.m5.

Version 3.0.m5.
Move to JDT/UI.
You can simulate the behaviour by pressing the "Go into top level type" tool 
bar button of the outline view.

Moving to JDT/Text to comment on the request to add filters to the outliner in 
general.
