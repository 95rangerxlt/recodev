Running TestAll of compiler.regression with -Drun.javac and -Djdk.root pointing to 8b115 I get errors in two suites:

EnumTest.test180 / test180a throw NPE in AbstractRegressionTest.runJavac()

BatchCompilerTest:
 - test230_sourcepath_vs_classpath
 - test236_classpath - test238_classpath
All through StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

I'm not sure whether this is specific to BETA_JAVA8.

The same for test176-test179 at 1.6+
Manoj, do you see continie to see these ?

EnumTest:
I see 11 failures and errors.. Please find the details below:

test171   Failed - Unused Excuse - removed the excuse and corrected the testcase (ref bug 267670)
test172   Failed - Unused Excuse - This test case itself is not correct, corrected the test case, kept the excuse.
test176   Error
test177   Error
test178   Error
test179   Error
test180   Error
test180a  Error

All the abve errors were due to passing null for JavaCoption, corrected by passing "JavaCoptions.Default". After the correction, test180 and test180a showed failures while the rest in the list above passed. And hence the failure list is:


Eclipse found warning(s) but JavaC did not find any
test186   Failed
test187a  Failed
test188   Failed

The above are fixed by adding a new runNegativeTest() which takes the JavacTestOptions to be added, and passing the apt Excuse(In these cases, an EclipseHasSomeMoreWarnings since javac does not produce warnings for the above cases)


To fix the above, the following commit has been done:http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=277b33164a7aa6b44e8af80cbf75c89be37ef9e5

With this, we have the following 2 issues left:
JavaC Found Error(s) but Eclipse did not find any
test180   Failed
test180a  Failed

These have been analyzed and found to be issue with the classpath. We are not passing the classpath to javac. An addition of -cp led to fixing these, but opening up 7 issues. I find that some WORK is pending under compile() in ART, but need more analysis since those changes have wider audience and hence the commit to address the 9 failures/errors out of the original 11 issues.
Manoj, If I understood it correctly, this bug is about problems in the
harness not about ECJ/Javac behavior difference. If the NPE and AIOOB
are addressed, let us close this one and continue analysis on the other
bug,

Closing this bug as no NPE/AIOOB/other errors exist (only failures which are tracked in bug 404648
