The old search engine only collected affected compilation units if only those
where requested. The new one keeps every match in memory which for example is
unnecessary for inline method. The new engine should support a granularity mode
and you should check evey caller of getAffectedCompilationUnits to see which
granularity mode is appropriate.

Dirk can you give me some stats to report on this improvement please?
The change improved the memory footprint of Inline method. However, I don't have
any numbers if you are asking for this.
