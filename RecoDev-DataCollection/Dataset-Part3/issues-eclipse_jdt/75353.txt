F3 will attempt to find a type based on the current selection range.  If the 
selection range is length 0, it will take the encompassing "word" and try to 
find that element.  But, if a range is selected, it will try to match based on 
the selected text.  I don't understand when someone would use this latter 
case.  To me, I would prefer to have it always take the caret location, and 
then search based on the surrounding word, never the selection range.

For example, I search for a method containing the word "accessible", and I find 
a method call to "getAccessible". Now, I want to go to the method declaration 
using F3, but part of the method name is swiped.  I would never want to open 
the Type "Accessible", but this is what happens.

My usage pattern is also closer to what you describe.
