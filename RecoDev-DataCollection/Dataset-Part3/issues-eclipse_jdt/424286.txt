0.9.0 is available.
Marking as subtasks some bugs which could not be resolved based on spec version 0.7.0
0.9.1 is available.
While iterating through all of 0.8.0-diff I made a series of changes pushed individually as

Part G of ..., I should've said.
Just found a nice new rule in 18.5.2:

"T is a reference type, but is not a wildcard-parameterized type, and either i) B2 contains a bound of one of the forms α = S or S <: α, where S is a wildcard-parameterized type, or ii) B2 contains two bounds of the forms S1 <: α and S2 <: α, where S1 and S2 have supertypes (4.10) that are two different parameterizations of the same generic class or interface."


"That's elementary, Watson!"
A batch of changes from spec 0.9.0 has been pushed as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=49d173b6a20e491492d309e521a8df899e49ca65

I have more changes in my workspace, but when applying the spec updates by the letter we'd create more regressions than benefit. I've requested clarification here: http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-spec-experts/2014-January/000483.html (asking also for an example requiring the unspeakable rule quoted in comment 6).

The good news: those changes seem to fix the deviation between ecj and javac witnessed by GTT.test1325() and GTT.test1434()
Regressions mentioned in comment 7 are:

extra Type mismatch in:
- GTT.test1012()
- GTT.test0416()
- LET.testBug419048_1()
- LET.testBug419048_2()
- LET.testBug419048_3()
- GTT_1_8.testBug424195b()
- GTT_1_8.testBug418807()
- GTT_1_8.testBug424195_comment2()

bogus message ("cannot convert from Object to Foo")
- GTT_1_8.testBug424195a()

I managed to resolve these by the following measures:

Some of these seem to result from the fact that we have no dedicated compatibility rules for "erasures". Using raw types instead seems like a fair solution.

In some cases we created inference variables as substitutions for inference variables. Although the spec has no word about this, avoiding such double-substitution sounds like a reasonable thing to do.

In one case we where checking compatibility of an inference variable with some other type. Since this happened in the context of findSuperTypeOriginatingFrom() it seems fair to consider inference variables as not compatible with anything in this context.

This should be all for 0.9.0 - still need to iterate 0.9.1-diff (although some of the above changes already consider 0.9.1).
Final updates from 0.9.1.diff *and 0.9.2.diff* have been released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=cab98b2b8859caae533ee4cfbe628b2265262135
