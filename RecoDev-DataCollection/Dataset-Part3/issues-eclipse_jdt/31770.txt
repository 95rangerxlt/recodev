it'd be nice to have a hover help for the top-right error indicator in the 
editor

something like: "you have 1 error and 2 warnings in this file"
it'd serve 2 purposes:
 - explain to people what the thing means (when i don't know what something is, 
i hover over it and expect some help)
 - provide a lightweigth (i.e. task-list-less) way to count errors/warning

Additional suggestion:  clicking the box would jump you to the next error from
the current caret position.
