Since we moved to the new NLS format, I cannot externalize strings any more. 
Whenever I open the wizard on a file and check the option to use the new NLS 
format, I get the following error:

'Some keys are invalid'

I also get error overlay on a bunch of keys in the checkbox column. I cannot 
work until this is fixed.

Nothing on heaven or earth can enable the Finish button.
It just sits there, gray and distant.
Fixed in HEAD. The problem was that we tried to validate keys for IGNORED and
INTERNALIZED entries.

Since the re-build already started I won't ask for yet another re-build. If you
immediately need to use the wizard you can either use upcoming N-build or I can
send you a patched version of the JDT UI plug-in.

thanks.  we could just use the cool plug-in export wizard.
Yes, but if you do so, you have to do the following:
1. get JDT UI versioned for this weeks I-build (v20050419-0800)
2. replace ExternalizeStringWizardPage with the latest revision (1.73)
3. export


If you take all JDT UI HEAD you will be broken because you are missing some new
API from Platform Text that got introduced today.
Thanks for a quick fix. I suspected it was something simple. I got used to the 
wizard so much that I cannot do without it any more.
