- given the following method body:

  foo();

- now insert a new line before foo and start typing

  if (expression) {

observe: smart edit inserts a closing bracket after method invocation foo(); 
IMO in 99% of the cases this is not what the user wants when typing the full if 
statement. The generated code should look like:

if (expression) {
}
foo();

Re-tested with R3.4M6a. This is fixed. The resulting close bracket is now placed on the line before "foo();" and the cursor is placed on an appropriately indented line above that. Like this:

    if (expression) {
        <cursor here>
    }
    foo();
