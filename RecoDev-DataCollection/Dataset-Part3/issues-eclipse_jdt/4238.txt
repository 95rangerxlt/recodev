- Changing the source folder from default to src/bin subfolders in a project results in a mess. 
	E.g., the files are not moved to the new structure (only empty folders are created. 
	In one case, after some manipulations to get back to the old structure, the hierarchical 
	resource directory got flattened (every subfolder appeared as top level entry in the hierarchy 
	with dot notation). The new structure is also not propagated to other projects that use the 
	changed one. (fix: remove the dependeny in the build path, then add it again). Somehow this 
	is a hickup in the otherwise very welcome policy to allow people to go from simple uses to 
	expert handling smoothly.
	

NOTES:
EG (9/24/2001 8:16:10 AM)
	need to reconsider whether we provide more support for migrating a project from
	one layout to the other.

Martin, can you please investigate how expensive that is ?

sorry, moved by error
*** Bug 14271 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Improved source folder wizard.
Invoked on a project, the wizard will allow a new source folder but warn that 
this replaces the existing project source folder. The output location is also 
changed automatically, if the user agrees (old class files removed).
We decided to not yest add propagate the old structure to the new source folder.
