Build id: 200312182000

Test case (with syntax error):

public class Bug {
  void test ()
  {
    new Object () {
      public void yes ()
      {
        System.out.println ("hello world");
      }
    };
    System.out.println ("hello world");

    Object object = null;
    Object o = new Object ()
  }
}

1. Select "object" and run Refactor:Rename...
   I get a NullPointerException in the Error log; no changes are made.
2. Select "test" and run Refactor:Rename...
   You get a meaningful error message.
   Now select "yes".
   "Refactor:Rename..." is unavailable in the context menu.
   If you run it using the keyboard, you get a different,
   less helpful error message.
   It seems there shouldn't be a difference between the two methods.
   If anything, I would expect "yes" to be less affected than "test"
   since the syntax error is in the latter.

works in 3.2
