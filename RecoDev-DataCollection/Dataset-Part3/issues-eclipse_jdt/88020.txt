Using build I20050308-1510.

I've created empty compilation unit package-info.java in default package.
Now I create a new package (let say 'test') in my project and want to move my
empty CU in this package => I get following NPE:
Root exception:
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.search.matching.MatchLocator.findIndexMatches(MatchLocator.java:308)

Thinking it was a Search Engine issue, I looked at it and see that MatchLocator
pattern was null...!

After tracing what happened, it seems that MoveCuUpdateCreator.getReferences
method is not protected from the fact that pattern creation may fail in certain
circumstances (empty cu for example) and always perform a search...
