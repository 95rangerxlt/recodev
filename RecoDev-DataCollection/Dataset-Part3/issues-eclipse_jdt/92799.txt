all-types-cache was originally created exactly for this very dialog. :-)
I would like to see the history sorted alphabetically.
I think the Camel Case pattern support is a good idea, but it would be better if
I didn't have to use caps : 'lhm' should also select 'LinkedHashMap'.
I haven't seen the new dialog yet but histories are generally displayed in
date/time order.
But when the rest of the dialog sorts the types names alphabetically, having 
the history sorted differently makes it harder to find a type.

You end up typing more of the name that you should have to.
Here is the state of what is going into tonights integration build:

- when the dialog pops up the history is still MRU
- as soon as a pattern exists (user started typing) the history is sorted, but
  still separated from the types returned form search history
- I made blank the end character as well. So if you want to go to "SWT" you can
  type "SWT " which only leaves SWT in the list
- regarding lower case camel case: I looked into this but this isn't doable with
  out making the search engine aware of camel case. The reason is that pattern
  entered in the open type dialog is case insensitive. However to not have to 
  many matches in a camel case search I have to make the pattern case 
  sensitive. Other search for npe would mean search for n*p*e* which results in
  far to many matches and sorting them will take longer since I have to 
  compute a category. So to limit the number of matches in the first place I
  search for N*P*E* case sensitive which gives far less matches.

Dirk, can't you search bot both patterns "^lhm*" and "L*H*M*" when user entered
 lover case "lhm"? That shouldn't require changes in search engine.
See comment #1 in 93781. I already looked into this.

I thought that Lucene allows to combine multiple search terms within one search
query. Is there limitation in a current type search?
Playing a bit more with this dialog, I noticed that the search became
case-sensitive if the first character of the pattern is a capital letter.

If I type 'cl' or 'cL', I get java.lang.Class in the list of matching types, but
if I type 'CL', I don't get java.lang.Class.

This limitation was not in 3.0.
The pattern is only case sensitive if you type a sequence of upper case letter
followed by only lower case letters (for example ImAge matches Image). This is
needed for the camel case thing. 

I agree that this wasn't the case in the old dialog but not doing so means
giving up on camel case patterns. 
We are not using Lucene for the Java index.
It is a blooper that the package qualification for unique types is shown only
when I select the raw in the list.
That is: if it's unselected it looks like ChangeQueue but when selected it's 
ChangeQueue - org.eclipse.jface.viewers.deferred
This is unexpected.
> It is a blooper...

Maybe so, but you are seeing as much or more info than in 3.0.
now this one is a bug (lost functionality):
I have 2 JDKs in my workspace (1.4 and 1.5) I wanted to have a look at the 
source of Vector in both.
It used to show me that it was available in 2 JDKs, now it just shows me the 
package it comes from (after selecting it arbitrary chooses the first one)

Dirk, should I enter a separate report? - this is major for me.
Adam, which build are you using. 

This works for me. See the attached screen shot. Do you have a constallation
where  Vector isn't fully qualified.
Created attachment 21347
Screen shot
Adam, are all classes from your "second" JDK missing or only Vector. If so then
this sounds more like a search engine bug not reporting all matches anymore.
sorry, my bad. I had the JDK set up allright, but no project was using it. 
silly me. disregard.
Dirk, is it possible to put classes that has source available as part of
workspace projects before classes that came from jar files or some attached sources?
I like the speed of the new Open Type dialog (except for the initial indexing
phase) but the old user interface was consistent with Open Resource (Navigate >
Open Resource..., Ctrl+Shift+R) and Go To Resource (Navigate > Go To >
Resource...). Are these going to change too? 

Platform/UI is looking if they can adapt to the new layout (see bug 94382). 
this is very minor but I'd change the TZ=TimeZone into something different. 
Someone might be fooled into thinking that TimeZone actually refers to 
something about time. How is LHS=LinkedHashSet?
another problem: I was playing today with many projects, opening and closing 
them. It seems that opening a project is not enough for the indexer to re-put 
the project's type into the index. After I open the project, its types are 
still not visible! Only rebuilding helps. Nothing in the log. When the dialog 
opens it says that it's updating the indices. But even after it's done, the 
types are still not visible.
Adam,

- regarding TZ. A previous version of the dialog used LHM and I was asked to
  change this since not many programmers now that there is a LinkedHashMap ;-)

- regarding open projects please see bug 95895.
Regarding comment #22: you should get this after a while for types you already
opened since they will go into the history (assuming that you are more
interested in the source types than the binary). In the workspace list I think
it is better to stick to a alphabetic sorting.

It is not about history, but jut regular case. The thing is that I'm using Maven
and all classes are placed to Maven repository, so there are lot of jars created
from workspace projects and they all appear on top of the list in open type dialog.

Dirk, a heads up (don't know how to reproduce in a small workspace)
some types are just not visible in the new dialog. (this time I did not
close/reopen anything). For some reason they're just not there.

I've been using Open Resource a lot lately because of this bug. Open Type in M7
works for me half of the time.
Adam, since the dialog is now using the search engine directly it would be
helpful if you can do the following when it happens: do a search for type
declaration using the name you are looking for using the nornal search dialog.
If search doesn't find the type declaration either then the bug is in the search
engine.

Adam, if you using lots for external jars you might want to CC yourself to 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=93668 which describes a scenario
where the search indices are not rebuilt resulting in missing types in the dialog.
Thanks Dirk. 
No luck. The search finds the type no problem. It's just missing from the 
dialog. That's M7 vanilla
(sorry to spam everyone :))
one more thing - this is a source class, not from a jar.
Can you zip your workspace ?
I will close this one. If you still see problems with the Open Type dialog in
RC1, please file individual bug reports.
