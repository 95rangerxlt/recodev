See bug 37200.
The JDT/Core code is not protected against the null case when the source for a
new method is incorrect. Fixing this code still leads to an internal error,
because the UI is not handling JavaModelException where IType.createMethod is
called. The same problem could happen with createType(...), createField(...), etc.
The problem with createMethod can easily happen if the user enters an invalid
comment for method in the preference page.

Martin, the code Olivier refers to is in generate delegate. Can you please 
take care of this.
Martin A, you are the body of Martin M. 
i hope he meant 'buddy'
LOL
Ho Martin, Adam, Dirk. I'm still alive ;), no body at all.
I have a training next week so I am not available. But I will look at it at 
the end of May.
I fixed that a line delimiter is added to the method comment. This fixes
original problem of this bug, but it would be good to review that exceptions are
better handled.
closing this bug, seems to be fixed in 20031219
