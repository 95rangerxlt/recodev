Is it possible that I get this error in build I20021119?  I just experienced a
severe editor presentation corruption, and I'm wondering if it's the same bug.
The steps were different (I was copying & pasting into a single parameter method
invocation).  I will attach the log file.  If you think it's a different bug, I
will enter a new bug report.

I am still getting this error in build 20021127 so I suspect it is a different
bug.  I have opened up new bug 27280.
