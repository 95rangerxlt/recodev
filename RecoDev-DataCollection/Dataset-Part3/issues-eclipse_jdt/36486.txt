Created attachment 4615
ViewSiteAdapter added

Added a view site adapter to CallHierarchyViewPart which converts the
selections for the actions created by the view itself.

Also added some of the general action groups (Refactor, Java Search etc.) which
expect IJavaElements as the selection.

The MethodWrapper class implements IAdaptable and is able to adapt to
IJavaElement. Is that enough?
released
looks fine - i will investigate how to add the compare actions
