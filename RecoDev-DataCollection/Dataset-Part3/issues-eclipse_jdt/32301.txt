Hello,

Thanks for a wonderful IDE with all these rich features. 

I think we have a small bug in the Java Browsing Perspective. As an example: 
Please create a package called "test" in your project. Then create a parallel 
package called "test_a". After refreshing project, test_a will show up as a 
child of "test" and also as its parallel project. "test_a" is actually a 
parallel package, and should show up only alongside "test", not under it.

Thanks,
agam

Confirmed on I20030216+. You have to switch to hierarchical layout to see the 
problem.

Dani, any comments ?
Looks like a bug in the Packages view content provider
Should be fixed for 2.1

Note I only see the bug when
Looks like this is caused by the '_' character. If there's a RC1 rebuild I'll
try to put it in there otherwise definitely a must fix for RC2.

Fixed bug which also improves performance in that area.
Not yet released to HEAD since RC2 fixes need to be posted and approved first.
