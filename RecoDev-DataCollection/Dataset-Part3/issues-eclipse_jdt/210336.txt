package a;
public class A {
List var = new ArrayList();
}

package b;
public class B extends a.A {
    public void doSomething() {
        new ArrayList().size();
    }
}

In the above snippet, if you try to extract "new ArrayList()" as a local variable "var" in doSomething(), you will be warned that a variable with that name is already present in the visible scope.
