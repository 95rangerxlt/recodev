build I20030316

Kevin called in to report the following:

- with an installed JRE that does not have source attached,
- open a type in the rt.jar (e.g. java.awt.Color)
- attach source
- the editor flashes many times before it displays the source, then continues 
to flash for several more seconds

I was able to reproduce it on Win XP.
