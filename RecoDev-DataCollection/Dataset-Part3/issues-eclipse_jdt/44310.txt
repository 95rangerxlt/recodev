I20030930: When using the "Externalize strings" refactoring on a string like:

"Ignores all occurrences of \"{0}\" in the document"

the escape sequences are not correctly resolved. In the properties file, the 
newly inserted line looks as follows:

key=Ignores all occurrences of \"{0}\" in the document

At least escape combinations for " should be correctly translated. Other 
escape sequences like \r,\n,\b, ... make less sense.

Markus, can you provide a fix for this.
Additionally, it might be worth considering leaving '' (2 following quotation 
marks) as they are, @see java.text.MessageFormat and derivatives

Fix

- \" and \' from source srings are no longer escaped in the wizard and the
.properties file
- fixes bug which dropped the last " in some cases
- defers escaping of .properties-comment-chars to just befor writing the file
Martin, could you please release the fix?
