The action org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.packageview.OpenResourceAction handles a
PartInitException by generating an error dialog indicating that a Java editor
could not be opened. This can be a little misleading since the resource may not
have been a java element and thus some other associated editor was attempting to
open (for example, an editor for a manifest file or xml file).

This may apply to the action org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.OpenAction as well.

OpenResourceAction got removed from 2.1 stream (deprecated internal API). Fixed 
error text for OpenAction.
