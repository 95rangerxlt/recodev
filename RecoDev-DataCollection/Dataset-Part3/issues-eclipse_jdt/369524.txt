I20120123-1800, Mac OS X 10.7.2, follow-up to bug 325777

'Preferences > Installed JREs > Search...' should also find JDKs from Developer Packages. Looks like the implementation currently only finds VMs in
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/

It should also search in
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/

That's the place where Java Developer Packages from 
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action are installed (search for 'Java').

These VMs are also listed by /usr/libexec/java_home -X

The Developer Packages are interesting because they also include source. To add them in Eclipse today, you have to know the full path into the bundled folder. The Directory... chooser won't bring you there. In my case, it was:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0_29-b11-402.jdk/Contents/Home

I cannot get access to one of these packages as I am not a registered Apple developer and have no intention of creating an Apple account.

Markus, would it possible for you to run this for me so I can see the shape of the XML for the developer packages in the output (I assume it is the same as the rest, but maybe not)? Put a breakpoint in MacInstalledJREs line 154 and copy the text out of the details pane.

partial fix

This patch contains a fix that allows the Mac VM searching to ignore any invalid VM definitions (ones that fail to parse, etc) and return any VMs it does find - before it would abort completely and return none.

The logic to compute the VM id is also updated.

Testing this patch I was able to search for and find all VMs - developer ones included - on Silenio's Snow Leopard machine.

I pushed the patch to:

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=118a08613f14fbf910ee63d882ae035942f93cc1

Markus, if you have a Lion machine, I would be interested to know if the patch works there as well.
I pushed more tests for our plist parser + JREDescriptor here:

I didn't thoroughly check the code, but I verified that everything works fine with the I20120427-1000 on my Mac OS X Lion (10.7.3) install.

I pushed an additional change the prevents JREs with the same path from being added as separate JREs. This case was found by adding a JRE by hand (using the Add.. button) and then doing a search. Duplicates would show up because of the way we used compute the ID for a VMStandin.
