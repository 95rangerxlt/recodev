Build 20020402

1) Load org.eclipse.core.resources plugin as source from repository
2) Open java editor on org.eclipse.core.internal.resources/Workspace.java
3) Edit some method.  One concrete example: add a space after the opening brace 
of the method closing(IProject)
4) Now select any method *below* that method in the content outline

The source positions no longer match up (i.e., the method name that was selected 
in the outline is not highlighted in the source file).  If a single space was 
added in the method above, the source position will be off by one, etc. This is 
much worse in the method-level editor, because now it doesn't show the correct 
method contents.

I tried to reproduce in a smaller file, but with no luck.  On small files, the 
source positions will be incorrect if you quickly click in the content outline 
before the incremental reconciler can catch up.  This is acceptable, but in the 
case of Workspace.java, I waited a minute or so and it was still incorrect.

Suspecting the issue to rather be in the editor part.
Could not reproduce on F2. Suspect the reconciler/parser to be crashed while 
parsing the file.
