Version 3.1.M2.
Add a quick-fix for:

'enum' should not be used as an identifier, since it is a reserved keyword from
source level 1.5

The quick-fix would do a rename on local variable called 'enum' to 'enumeration'.

The quick-fix would do a rename on local variable called 'enum' to 'enumeration'.
Currently, the quick fix would not be very interesting, since 'Rename in file'
already does the job. Might be cool when quick fixes can be applied to multiple
targets at once (see bug 23889).
added new quick fix: Opens local rename and already fills in 'enumaration' as
name suggestion.
Also added similar quick fixes for 'assert', hiding and redefined variables.
