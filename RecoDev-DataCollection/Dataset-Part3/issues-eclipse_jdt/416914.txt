+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #416740 +++

In order to be able to use the tycho-surefire-plugin, it would be nice to get rid of the nested jars in test bundles which confuse surefire.

Why are there some nested jars? Here is the answer from Dani (Megert):
"""
Almost all our (Platform, JDT, PDE) test bundles have their class files inside a JAR that's inside the JARed bundle. This is simply for historical reasons: back in the old days, each bundle was in a directory with a JAR that contained the class files. When we started to JAR most of our bundles, we converted them to have the class files directly in the bundle JAR. We did not do this for the test bundles just because there was neither a reason nor a benefit. We can accept patches that fix this, but each patch must fix all test projects inside the same repository for consistency and of course you must verify that all tests are still green before submitting the patch.

Submitted Gerrit patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/16290
Setting target to M3. We have M2 next week and we should not destabilize the current build.
Submitted with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=6ab6993eaa428b3a730cfb2e733cccd5532cf142

Sorry it took so long. There was M2 and then I was on vacation.
