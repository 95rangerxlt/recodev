create a project with 2 src folders
create 2 folders and make them linked to 1 place on the file system
now, set up the 2 folders as output folders for the src folders

close and reopen the dialog
note that 'default output location' is shown for both src folders 
(it's a lie - don't look at it)

now, add an exclusion folder to one of the src folders
close and reopen the dialog

look at the checkbox 'allow output folder per source folder' - it's unchecked ! 
and now the 'default output location' message is true - your settings are gone
