I think the editor background color preference should be on the appearance page 
and not on the syntax page. Doesn't seem to be intuitive the way it is now.

This has been fixed in I200412011139: there's now a shared/global editor bg
preference. It is currently under Workbench > Editors > All Text Editors
but this can still change since preference rework is still ongoing.
