Build 3.2M6

URL detection is unable to detect a link if not prefixed strictly by a space.

e.g. will not detect URL in case below
//https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=86813
public void test012() {
}

Like TODO task detection, it could consider any leading character which isn't a letter to be elligible. In ctrl-click case, there isn't much to process anyhow on the current line.
