I changed a method name using Refactor / Rename.

This change did not propagate to a @link tag (in a different source file) that
refered to the old method name.

This is related to bug 6224 ("rename java doc reference to parameter").

Needs support from JCore. The indexer should also contain references to Java 
elements used in special tag inside Javadoc.
Moving to JDT Core for commenting. Are there plans to provide this for 2.x ?
No, we only want to index sources, and ignore comments alltogether.

You may want to consider a separate javadoc support for finding javadoc 
matches... unclear. Maybe you could reconsider once we come up with a generic 
indexing infrastructure. Growing the existing indexes with javadoc information 
might be a little expensive, and our current search infrastructure doesn't give 
you a way to represent such references.

Also, we would need a custom solver to resolve javadoc references to actual 
types/methods/fields.

Back to JDT/UI. Should resurface later.
This also affects @see tag as well as refactorings that change the fully 
qualified name of a Java element (all rename, move, ....).

From bug 21874. We should also try to consider <code>name</code> places since 
they are widly used to refer to Java symbols.

Could you please have a preference control whether that's done or not?

No action planned for 2.1. For > 2.1 we consider indexing Java doc which will 
help a lot here.
I notice that this hasn't been updated with a target milestone.  Was or is this 
considered for the 3.0 milestone?
This is considered for 3.0, but we haven't decided yet when we add this. 
Reopening...
Got addressed for 3.0
