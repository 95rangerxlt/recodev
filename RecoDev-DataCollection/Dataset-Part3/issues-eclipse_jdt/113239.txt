* COMPILER / Treating Optional Error as Fatal
*    When enabled, optional errors (i.e. optional problems which severity is set
to "error") will be treated as standard
*    compiler errors, yielding problem methods/types preventing from running
offending code until the issue got resolved.
*    When disabled, optional errors are only considered as warnings, still
carrying an error indication to make them more
*    severe. Note that by default, errors are fatal, whether they are optional
or not.
