1) Start with the following expression in a method:

double x, y;
int result = x / y;

There is a compilation problem, because it cannot auto-cast the double result to
an int.

2) Invoke quick fix on the error.  Choose to add cast to int.

It produces:

double x, y;
int result = (int) x / y;

This still reports a compile error, because cast has higher precedence than
division.  The correct result would have been:

double x, y;
int result = (int) (x / y);
