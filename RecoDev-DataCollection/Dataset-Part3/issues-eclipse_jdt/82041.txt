Version: 3.1.0
Build id: 200412210800

When you open a class file that has no source attachment but has full debugging
information the editor does not show the real names of method arguments.

1. Open a class file editor on a class file that does not have a source
attachment but has local variable debugging info.
2. Notice that the method arguments have generic names "arg<n>"

ClassFileEditor is not asking the class file reader to look in the method bodies
for info.

In ClassFileEditor#updateCodeView, change:
int flags= IClassFileReader.FIELD_INFOS | IClassFileReader.METHOD_INFOS |
IClassFileReader.SUPER_INTERFACES;

to:
int flags= IClassFileReader.FIELD_INFOS | IClassFileReader.METHOD_INFOS |
IClassFileReader.METHOD_BODIES | IClassFileReader.SUPER_INTERFACES;

It doesn't appear to parse all of the byte code of the method bodies so it
shouldn't slow things down too much for large class files.

Good hint. Thanks.
