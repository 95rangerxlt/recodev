The "Convert to lambda expression" quick assist should enter linked mode for the newly created parameters, so that the user can easily modify the names and references.

Example:

	<T, S> BiFunction<java.util.List<S>, S, Object> foo() {
		return List<S>::add;
	}

Patch

Added linked mode support for lambda parameters and their references.
Markus, please review.
Looks good, but I don't think the references to the created lambda parameters should be in the tab sequence.

I've set them to LinkedPositionGroup.NO_STOP, added proposal.setEndPosition(..), and released as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=bfad2405649c214e53565328232ae49c0fa20230
