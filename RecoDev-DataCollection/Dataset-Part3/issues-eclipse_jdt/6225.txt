The "Add unimplemented methods" action creates comments with 
javadoc tags, however, the comment style is a *normal* multi-line 
java comment instead of a *javadoc* comment.

This is in build 20011107

This is the intended behaviour. Generating a real javadoc would hide the one 
from the base class in the generated javadoc. This is almost always the 
intended, but wen provide a preference option for how this case should be 
handled.
preference page allows you to configure comment creation
(for example, do not create the non-JavaDoc comments)
