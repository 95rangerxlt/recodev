consider the following file:
public class Test
{
   public void method()
   {
      String x = "hello";
   }
   
   public class C
   {
   
   }
}
-------------------
if you select the method starting the 'p' in "public void method()"
and paste it just below with smart pasting enabled you get the following:

public class Test
{
   public void method()
   {
      String x = "hello";
   }
   public void method()
      {
         String x = "hello";
      }   
   public class C
   {

   }
}

If you then paste it as part of class C you get the following:

public class Test
{
   public void method()
   {
      String x = "hello";
   }
   public void method()
      {
         String x = "hello";
      }   
   public class C
   {   
      public void method()
         {
            String x = "hello";
         }      
   }
}

It would be nice if the brackets line up with the method. This can probably be 
achieved if you treat the first line of the pasted text as different to the 
other lines because you cannot guarentee that text selection will always start 
from the beginning of the line with the correct ammount of tabs/spaces in the 
first line of a selection.
