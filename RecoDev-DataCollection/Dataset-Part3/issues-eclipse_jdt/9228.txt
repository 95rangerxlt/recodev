As there are runtime exceptions, wich can be interesting to catch by clients, 
it would be nice to allow the surround feature on any code snippet. Standard 
exception could be Throwable.

please note that catching Throwable is inherintely *evil*

Right, i never do it :-)
A better try could be catching RuntimeException and adding e.printStacktrace().
I often see code which is just catching the exception and an empty catch block. 
This would be an advancement vs the fast 'i just want to test a bit, and than i 
do something useful with the exception' style.
I would like to have this feature too. Instead of having an info dialog 'No 
exception to catch', it could be a Confirm dialog, 'No exception thrown, ok to 
add a generic catch Throwable clause?'
There is now a dialog asking you if runtime exceptions are supposed to be 
caught. The catch block doesn't contain a e.printStackTrace since it would 
require different code. If you want to see it open a separate PR. But it is 
very likely that it will not be considered for 2.0 <g>.
