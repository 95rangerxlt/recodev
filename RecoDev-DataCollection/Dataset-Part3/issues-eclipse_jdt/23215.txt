Type Hierarchy allows to switch between its 3 views by hitting Ctrl + 1, Ctrl +
2, Ctrl + 3 (that's what Tooltips say). 2 & 3 work fine, but my Hierarchy
doesn't react on Ctrl + 1.

Maybe there's an interference with Quick Fix (Ctrl + 1 too, but only active in
JavaEditors).

Darn, this guy stealing Ctrl + 1 KeyEvents has returned!
Ctrl + 1 in Type Hierarchy is out of order again.
This bug doesn't seem to be caused by the TypeHierarchy, since I experience the
same problem in the plugin I'm working on. There I have a straightforward
KeyAdapter which works for Ctrl + 2, but not for Ctrl + 1.
Martin, can you investigate who's eating the accelerator? Does it have to do 
with the new keybinding code in Platform UI?
We could define an action definitioin + a scope for this view actions,then the 
user can configure the keys same as for global actions.

Need to revisit when making an action definition ID pass.
