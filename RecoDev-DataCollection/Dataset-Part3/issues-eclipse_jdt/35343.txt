Hovering the following variables with the ctrl key pressed shows the error:
 
public class AClass{
	String str = "SomeText";
	String strWithGtLt = "<SomeText>";
	String strWithEntity = "&#230;SomeText";
}

Hovering str shows: '(...)String strWithoutGtLt = "SomeText";'.
Hovering strWithGtLt shows '(...)String strWithGtLt = "";'.
Hovering strWithEntity shows '(...)String strWithEntity = "æSomeText";'

Error properly because protected character entities like &,> and < are not 
escaped properly in the hover help.

I am using 2.1 RC2 (Build id: 200303071024).

Your problem report has been resolved in the 3.0 stream because source is now
extract in another way and displayed in a source viewer. However, the cause for
it is still there and reported in bug 29372. You might want to add yourself to
the cc-list of that bug.
