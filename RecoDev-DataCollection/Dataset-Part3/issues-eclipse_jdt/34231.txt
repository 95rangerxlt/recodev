I have a constructor Foo(String) that I want to change to Foo(String[]) with 
Refactor/Change method sig. In the dialog, I a message: "The type name 'String
[]' is not a valid identifier".

An unneeded limitation.

Tag as RC3 candidate, but likely not critical enough for 2.1
bug is in ParameterEditDialog
the problem does not exist if you edit the type name in the cell editor

Dirk - calling JavaConventions.validateJavaTypeName is not enough
please see ChangeSignatureRefactoring.isValidTypeName (although the dialog will 
not be able to easily use it)

i recommend moving to LATER - there's a very simple workaround and the problem 
is not critical
2.1 Readme
Adam, any other recommendation how to fix this.
i guess fixing ParameterEditDialog is the right thing to do.
i can create a validation method in the refactoring class.
Please do so. Then I will adjust the UI.
*** Bug 38170 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
fixed both, the core and the ui classes
