Some source viewer configuration elements like auto indent strategies depend on
active editor state (e.g. smart mode). We need to find and fix those layer breakers.

Deferred.
It'd be even better if java source viewer config did not need the editor at 
all.  Seems like the source viewer config should just use info it gets from 
the source viewer.
Actually, this has been fixed in the 3.1 stream i.e. the configured features no longer depend on the active editor.

Regarding comment 2: this PR is about using state from the 'active' editor even if 'null' is being passed as editor argument to the JavaSourceViewerConfiguration. The editor is not required i.e. you get decent behavior without passing in an editor for most features.
