Build: 20020409

This is similar to 12565, but I don't think it is exactly the same, so I have
created a new bug.  The squiggles don't disappear when they should.

1. Create the following Java file, X.java:

public class X {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("foo");
	}
}


2. Save, (autobuild is on) no errors
3. Delete the ")" after "foo"
4. Save, you should get 2 errors
5. Add the ")" back, the squiggles highlighting the error do not go away. <-
problem is here
6. Save, no errors (as expected)
