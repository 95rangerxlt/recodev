3.1 RC1

The scripts that are generated by the Javadoc export wizard (javadoc.xml) and
the Jar exporter (xxx.jardesc) use a hardcoded text encoding (UTF-8)

These scripts should honor the new text file encoding preference.

Good 3.2 candidate.
Tobias, can you look into this and fix it in the Javadoc wizard as well?
I made a pass over the export facilities which use XML DOM:
- jar descriptions and user libraries are now written using the container encoding
- formatter profiles and javadoc ant scripts are now written using the content type encoding
