Please can I have a flag to turn off the new (new as in post-2.0) ctrl-F find 
feature where it finds stuff immediately.

When doing pure keyboard work this is irritating.
To see why, consider my prior use case:
(1) <ctrl-F>
(2) type in search data
(3) <enter>
(4) ...do some work on the first find location...
(5) <find-again>
(6) ...do some more work....
(7) goto (5)

This no longer works, because in order to make sure that that <find-again> 
works, I have to hit enter, which means that I initially end up at the __2nd__ 
occurrence of the searched-for text.

Thanks.

uncheck the 'incremental' box in the dialog and press 'close' - this will 
remember your setting.
doh!
