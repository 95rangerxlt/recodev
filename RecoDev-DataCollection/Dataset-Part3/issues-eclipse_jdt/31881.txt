Why can I override methods one at a time, but contructors is either all or 
none?  I should be able to choose which constructor I want to override.

A quick fix for 2.1 might be to show constructors in the override methods 
dialog.  Why aren't they there already? If you add a new checkbox tree dialog 
for override constructors, the user will have to invoke 2 different dialogs 
to "fill out" a subclass.  I'd rather just open one dialog.

Good suggestion, but will very likely not happen for 2.1 since it is feature 
work.
fixed in 3.0 M2
