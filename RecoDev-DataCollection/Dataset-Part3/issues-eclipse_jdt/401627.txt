The smoke test RunAllJava8Tests should also run RunCompilerTests, but only
in 1.8 mode. We are missing some failures otherwise sometimes, which cause
needless disruption to other committers.

Jay, can you follow up on this on a priority basis ? Thanks.
Jesper, are you interested in taking this up ? Jay is busy juggling half
a dozen things:

Basically, RunAllJava8Tests should run:

(1) org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression.TestAll (only in 1.8 mode)
(2) org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.parser.TestAll (only in 1.8 mode)
(3) org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.eval.TestAll (only in 1.8 mode)

(4) RunAllJava8Tests already runs encodes some Java8 tests which are
mentioned in one of these TestAlls. Such references should be removed
from RunAllJava8Tests so there is no duplication (not sure if junit
itself will eliminate duplicates, but still it is a good idea to clean
this up)

(5) ComplianceDiagnosticsTest should run in all modes 1.3 - 1.8.
OK, I'll take this

Thanks, please ignore the references to RunCompilerTests in comment#0,
Comment#2 describes what is requested.
Take a look at AbstractCompilerTest.buildMinimalComplianceTestSuite(Class, int)
This is useful to restrict the compliance levels.

A hack but works

Just thought we could use this for the time being. This is more of a hack but works alright.

Jesper, if you have started working on this and have a cleaner fix, feel free to post the patch. Otherwise, we can live with this - the RunAllJava8Test is a temporary suite anyway.
This won't work for all : RunCompilerTests is a wrapper not publicly available.
Jay, besides I am trying to get Jesper to resolve a number of bugs so we can
set the ball in motion for committer election process. So let him work on
this and come up with a solution that would benefit all.
I hope no-one is blocked by this, I have a number of other bugs to clear up before this one (currently focused on master / Kepler)

Sounds good. This present bug is nice to fix, but can be taken up in due
course when some cycles can be stolen.
Shankha, Please take Jay's help to wrap this up. Thanks.

Patch

I have run the test cases individually to make sure we are running all the test cases which we ought to run. 

Some test cases which were run directly under RunAllJava8 tests and which belong to org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression have been removed as these tests were only run on Compliance 1.8 and we are already running them as part of org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression suite.
Please review. The changes have been uploaded.

I haven't reviewed this patch in details but I found the following problems.

1. With the patch, RunCompilerTests only runs about 2797 tests. It should be over 10,122, which is what I see without the patch. Even after the fix, the existing tests and suites should continue to function the way they used to.

2. As per above number, RunAllJava8Tests should have the current no of tests in RunAllJava8Tests + 10,122 - whatever common tests these two might have. But I see only about 3400 tests when RunAllJava8Tests  is run with the patch.

3. Method setComplianceLevel() doesn't use the parameter, instead hard codes the compliance level.

Please address these issues and post a new patch.

Patch: 23 April

The review comments have been taken care of. Changes needed to be made in parser.TestAll as ComplianceDaignosticTest have to be run across all complaince levels. 

The total number of tests were : 12821. The Regression test and eval test are run in 1.8 mode. The parser tests except ComplianceDaignosticTest are run in 1.8 mode. 

Thanks.

New Patch

Made changes to make it more clearer how the changes help in making the paresr test runs without compliance daigonsitic test. 

The copyright information was updated for few files. 

We need not change the compliance level at the workspace level.

New Patch

New Patch uploaded so that can be applied through egit. Have checked the number of tests being run and results. They do not ave any discrepancies. 

Have renamed the function setTestClasses in TestAll.java under parser tests to getTestClassess. 

Thanks
Patch looks good and released to BETA_JAVA8 via commit:
