I find useful to define a template for tagging string literal as non-nls. I 
believe it could be provided by default.

Name:         nls
Description:  Non-NLS tag
Pattern:      //$$NON-NLS-1$$

Did you try Ctrl+1 (quick fix)?
This requires to learn a new keystroke... actually, I did not know about this 
quickfix, and had naively added a template for it. 

Wondering if quickfixes shouldn't be available through codeassist directly ?
