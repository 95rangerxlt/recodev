When searching for references for a type I'd like to have an option to not see 
matches in import statements. They are almost always uninteresting.

The general problem with filters in the search view is that we end up not seeing
the result but still see a marker in the editor.

For now we add a preference for this feature ("Work in Progress" preference page).


Instead of adding a preference we could try to contribute a toolbar toggle
button when we do a Java Search.

would be an option, but having a toolbar button for this minor annoyance is 
overkill.

I opt to do nothing for 2.1
Fixed in by Thomas for new search but the preference doesn't indicate that this
is only for new search: "Ignore references in import statements"

Suggest to adapt the label
when we add "query specific filters", then a filter for imports would be 
useful (we should not hide this option in the preferences)

trying to close this PR. Bugzilla is not cooperating.
