Javadoc-dialog.
It's so small that you can barely read the package-names on the second view, and
you have to read the tooltips to be able to determine which package to select.

As package-names tend to get rather long, I think many users will run into this
issue...

The Generate Javadoc export dialog is resizeable in the build 200403230800. 
However the default size doesn't look pretty good. Martin, can we make the 
initial with a little bit larger.
