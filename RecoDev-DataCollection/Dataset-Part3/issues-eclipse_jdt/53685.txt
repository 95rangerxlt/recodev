However, the file itself is not marked as having any errors or warnings, and 
none show up in the Problems view.
Note that the problems view shows the compile error of the saved state, same for
error annotations in the Java views.

Can you give an example code where you commented out code and errors are still
seen in the editor?
The file I saw this problem in was already in a saved state; the errors and 
warnings persisted in the vertical ruler despite that the file name was 
decorated in the editor's tab as having no new modifications (i.e., the 
asterisk was not showing) and contained no problems.  When I closed the editor 
and reopened it, the error and warning indicators no longer appeared in the 
vertical ruler.  The code in question is below.  The problem appeared after 
commenting out all lines within the method after the call to the loadTree 
method (This is code from org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.rose2ecore.RoseUtil 
that I intended to override):

        public void processUnitTree(final UnitTreeNode node) throws Exception {
            if (node != null) {
                loadTree(null, node);
                String packageName = node.getEcoreFileName();
                int fileSeparatorIndex = packageName.lastIndexOf
(File.separator);
                if (fileSeparatorIndex != -1) {
                    packageName = packageName.substring(fileSeparatorIndex + 
1);
                }
                int dotIndex = packageName.lastIndexOf(".");
                if (dotIndex != -1) {
                    packageName = packageName.substring(0, dotIndex);
                }
                ecoreBuilder.createEPackageForRootClasses(node.getExtent(), 
node.getRoseNode(), packageName);
                ecoreBuilder.setEEnums();
                ecoreBuilder.setEReferences();
                ecoreBuilder.setSuper();
                ecoreBuilder.setETypeClassifier();
                setIDs(node);
                validate(node);
            }
        }

Parts of that problem have been fixed in I20040309. There's a remaining issue
when you have the same CU open in two windows (see bug 54270).
