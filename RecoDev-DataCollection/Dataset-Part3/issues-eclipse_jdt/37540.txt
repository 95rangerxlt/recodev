Make an inner class that does not reference its outer class. Now use 
the "convert nested type to top level". A reference to the enclosing instance 
will be written in to the code even though it is note needed.

There should be an option to not generate such a reference if there is no 
reference to the enclosing instance already.

it could indeed be avoided if there are no references to members from the 
enclosing instance
i will treat it as an enhancement request - it's no a bug to create this field
*** Bug 38227 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
fixed, you have a choice now whether to create the field or not 
(whenever the choice is sensible)
tests added
