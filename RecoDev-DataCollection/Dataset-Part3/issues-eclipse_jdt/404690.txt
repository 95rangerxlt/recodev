Bug 391376 solves a problem that should actually be handled in the VM, see

Once that bug is fixed we should revisit our strategy for generating bridges.

This appears fixed.

The JavacHasABug excuse is no longer needed, cleaned up via bug 422051.

To be specific: it's Bug 391376 comment 3 which fixed generating bridge methods from a public class to a default method in a non-public superinterface.


As of bug 288658 we were already generating a bridge for a public method inherited from a non-public super class.
-> Javac (incl. 8b115) does the same.

As of bug 391376 we do the same if the super method is a default method in a non-public superinterface.
-> Javac does not insert this bridge method and as of http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=8009130 this has been fixed by more smarts in the JVM.

Spec 0.7.0 doesn't seem to make a statement about this. So playing by the reference implementation we should stop generating a bridge method to inherited default methods just for visibility issues.
Released for BETA_JAVA8 via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=3a2ceaad86457e3ad5d931538b1dbf293c95deb0

With this change we no longer generate a bridge to a default method in a non-public superinterface. With this we seem to be in sync with javac.
