	1. load JUnit
	2. open RepeatedTest
	3. add new lines after toString and add '/'.
	4. save & compile
	5. this will give a syntax error
	6. in the outline, on the type, replace from local history, choose a version without the changes
	7. replace button is activated, but pressing replace does not change anything

	AW guesses that the compilation error prevents replace from doing any work

NOTES:
EG (6/7/2001 10:28:45 AM)
	this is indeed the case, difficult to fix, but a warning that the range could not
	be identified would be appropriate.

AW (07.06.01 17:55:56)
	Compilation error is detected and Replace is prevented from changing editor contents.
	However Replace button isn't disabled and no error message is shown.
