It is easy to fix the source start to be the source start of the type reference 
in front of the .class. But the implementation of the source end is boggus as 
well. It does a source start + 4 which doesn't handle unicode cases.
I will try to fix both.

Submitted code to David. He will adjust the completion with the new positions.
Please release code when the completion is up to date.
Code assist is up to date
