Please see attached image. The dialog says ".. enter a path _RELATIVE_ 
to 'path/to/sourcefolder'" but the "Browse" dialog generates a path that is 
relative to sourcefolder parent.

It should be clarified, which path will be expected!

I suggest removing the current confusing behavior and replace it with a 
consistent behavior of project relative pathes. I assume a project relative 
path is stored in the IClasspathEntry anyway.
