first issue:
- open a java editor
- select the name of a method in the method declaration
- invoke "Push Down"
-> dialog opens, the selected method is checked but not selected
   -> It should be selected and revealed.

second issue:
- open java editor
- remove any selection
- invoke "Push Down" from the tool bar menu
-> you are asked to select a method or field first
   -> the action only needs to know the type of which methods should be pushed 
down in order to populate the dialog rather than any concrete method

first will be fixed 
second i'd defer

P2 for the first because if you have a longer list, then it's strange not to 
see the selected method
leaving as RC1 for now, but if bug 31568 cannot be fixed by then
we'll leave if as is for 2.1
fixed
opened bug 32115 for the second issue
