When you invoke "Assign Statement to field" using Ctrl+F 2 the popup window that should let you choose the name of field only appears for a second and then the first entry named "instance" is chosen automatically.

This must be a bug specific to that action, since the action "Assign Statement to local variable" works as expected showing the popup dialog and letting the user choose the name of the variable.

I assume you mean Ctrl + 2 F. It's not a dialog, just a proposal window.
I see the same on Win32. Look like a problem with the template engine. The proposals seem to open but close immediately. Cycling through the proposals with 'TAB' will bring you the proposals again.

The problem happens when the viewport needs to be adjusted and hence the proposal window gets closed.

Fixed in HEAD.

Great, thanks.
