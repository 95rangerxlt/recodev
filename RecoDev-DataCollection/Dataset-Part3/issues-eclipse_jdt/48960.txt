Edit a profile using the new code formatter pref page, go to "White Space" tab:
some terms are fully capitalized (e.g. Member Functions) while others only start
with a big letter (e.g. Control statements).

The page should use everywhere the same pattern.

Edit a profile using the new code formatter pref page, go to "White Space" tab:
some terms are fully capitalized (e.g. Member Functions) while others only start
with a big letter (e.g. Control statements).

The page should use everywhere the same pattern.
Same applies to the line wrapping page.
The rule we should use is as follows:

- top level node: first word capitalized and bold (will be possible in the 
  future)
- sub nodes: all lower case.
