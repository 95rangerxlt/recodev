Type the following.

public class Test {
}

Now insert the following method (by typing, not by pasting:

public class Test {
   public void a() {
   }
}

The following brackets are highlighted (signified by *)

public class Test {
    public void a() {* (1)
    }* (2)
}* (3)

The last bracket (3) is erroneously highlighted. When I first
type the first bracket (1), 3 is correctly highlighted, but when
I type (2), (3) is not de-highlighted.

Further experimenting indicates this is only one of several cases where 
brackets are incorrectly highlighted and not de-highlighted. After typing in 
some simple code, I had six separate brackets all highlighted at the same time.
