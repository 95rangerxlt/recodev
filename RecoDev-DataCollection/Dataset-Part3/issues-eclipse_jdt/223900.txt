See screenshot - the icon has a gray rectangle that should just be the regular yellow background color.

What setup do you have? I cannot reproduce here. I suggest to look at this together with Martin.

Should investigate for M6 as this is a new feature.
Martin saw it on my machine. I have no idea how my setup is different - what information do you need? This was with a very recent build, using a new workspace, on Windows XP.
Maybe some special settings in IE? The Browser widget uses those.
I haven't been able to find a explenation yet.
The generated images are the same on my and on Boris' platform. The images from Boris platform show up ok on my hover.


Same IE version? There are some settings in IE that override fonts. Maybe there are also some that affect images?
I have IE 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_qfe.070227-2300.

IE-specific patch

For more information see KB 294714: PNG Files Do Not Show Transparency in Internet Explorer
Another possibility would be to generate a PNG-8 file. IE 6 can render that and will pick up transparency information. (To be precise, it will pick up 1 bit of transparency information: fully transparent or fully opaque - this will get rid of any anti-aliasing. Other browsers can display PNG-8 images just fine and will use all the transparency information.)

There's a fix for that, right? People should just get the patches and not us hacking our code.

The problem is that this is a non-trivial algorithm where we have to analyze the colors used to create the best fit 256 color palette, and match all colors to the nearest fit. 

I think we have to fix this in M7 with the IE specific patch as outlined by Boris.

No. As far as I know the fix is called IE 7.

Yes, and what speaks against upgrading? As with security patches, people should also move forward with IE. Now there's a good reason ;-)

Because sometimes, large corporations are not eager to step up? :-)
Couldn't we replace the transparent palette entry with the background color?
Yes, if you can be sure about the background color in the browser.
We set the color in the html, so we know it. Unless of course someone has set the browser settings to ignore it.
good idea!
