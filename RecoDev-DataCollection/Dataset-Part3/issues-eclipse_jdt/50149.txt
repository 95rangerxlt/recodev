Leaking Closers after repeated ContentAssist

Steps:
- install a breakpoint in ContentAssistant.Closer.mouseDown(.) with condition:
    System.out.println(e);
    return false;

- launch a runtime workbench and call ContentAssist in a JavaEditor

- when the proposal list and the additional information popup are there, press
the shortcut for ContentAssist several times again

- after that, each mouse-click somewhere in the JavaEditor triggers serveral
Closer.mouseDown(.) events (which can be seen in the console)

verified. ContentAssistant.addContentAssistListener does always instantiate a
new Closer when the number of registered listeners is 1, no matter whether there
is already a listener or not.

hmm, priority change was due to a mozilla feature.
