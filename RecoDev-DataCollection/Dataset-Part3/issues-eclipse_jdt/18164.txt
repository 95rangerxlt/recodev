It should be possible to define library once (with descriptive name) and use it
in multiple projects.

What do you mean exactly by library ? A named set of components ? If so, you 
may want to check the new feature named 'classpath containers'.

See 
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.jdt.core/notes/r
2.0/classpath%20container/classpathContainer.html

These were added into build 20020423 and better. 

There is currently no UI for defining custom ones (containers are used to 
represent JDK installs when using the advanced mode on the library pane of the 
buildpath properties wizard).


Ok to close ?
Closing, please reopen if necessary.

Check JBuilder - library is a set of classes, documentation and source. They
have descriptive name (not filename like in Eclipse). Every item can be archive
or folder.
Defer post 2.0, containers are supposed to address these.
Reopening
Now containers are well supported, UI should offer to create some user custom 
ones.

we offer now user configurable libraries: you define them in the 'user
libraries; preference page and can add then to the class path like the JRE is added.
