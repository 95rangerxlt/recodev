after a method's signature is changed the pakckages view looses the selection
case:
1. class A{
void f(){}

2. select A::f() in the packages view
3. in the editor, change f() to f(int y)
4. note: the view lost the selection

both the member view in the browsing perspective and the outliner do it 
correctly (keep the selection)
