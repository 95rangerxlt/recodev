Build 20021115

I found an error in my log file that occurred this morning.  From looking
through local history, I can see that I was editing javadoc in IResource.java at
the time, replacing occurrences of the flag "DEEP" with "SHALLOW".  I believe I
was double-clicking on occurrences of the word "DEEP", and then hitting Ctrl+v
to paste in the word SHALLOW which was in the clipboard.  I have't been able to
reproduce the problem, but I thought the stack trace might be of some value in
tracking it down.

I should add that I have all "auto" features turned on, including auto-indent on
paste, and auto-format of javadoc. My theory is that this is related to the fact
that pasting a single longer word on top of an existing shorter word does not
cause  the javadoc to auto-wrap even if the new word causes it to exceed the
printable column margin.
