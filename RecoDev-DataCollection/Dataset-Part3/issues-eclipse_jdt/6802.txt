Previous builds expanded the tree when I looked at a locked method. Now only 
classes are shown. Having an "Expand All" action would help.

this is a good compromise between performance and usability
changed the implementation to always expand all.
for the hierarchy view (first button) this has been enabled all the time.
please file a new bugreport if this is too problematic for the performance.
