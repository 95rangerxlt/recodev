This is critical.
IncrementalProjectBuilder.findSourceFiles() for added files is calling 
setDerived(true) on the *source* file, not the *destination* file. The result 
is that new resource files in source directories are being marked as derived 
and excluded from team operations. The files in the bin/ folder, conversely, 
are not being marked as derived.

The entire resource copy process is tagging the wrong resource file (original) 
instead of target one.

Fixed occurrences of wrong logic in:

copyExtraResourcesBack()
  - org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.builder.BatchImageBuilder
findSourceFiles(IResourceDelta, int)
  - org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.builder.IncrementalImageBuilder (2 matches)
