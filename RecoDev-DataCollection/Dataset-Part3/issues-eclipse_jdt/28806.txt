In M4, if the balance options are on and you type a left parenthesis a right
parenthesis is inserted. Well and good. But if you position the cursor to the
right of the right parenthesis and backspace, both the right and left
parenthesis are deleted. This is not good. For example, suppose you have:

  super("description");

And you decide to wrap the string in a method call, e.g., by typing

  super(Local.getString("description");

As soon as you type the ( after getString, a second parenthesis is inserted, giving:

  super(Local.getString()"description");

But the right parenthesis isn't where it should be, so you try to delete it. But
as soon as you delete the right parens, the left is removed also, giving:

  super(Local.getString"description");

The only way to get parens around the string is to cut and paste the string into
the parenthesis. This is too hard. Balancing should not interfere with user
editing. Same comment applies to brackets, braces, etc.

Re-tested on R3.4M6a. I was unable to cause it to fail in the way that this bug describes.


It is now smarter when to insert the additional ')'.
