3.1 M2 test pass

The formatting of conditionals modified by the new quick assists is misleading.
Consider the following:

if (c1) {
    one();
} else if (c2) {
    two();
} else {
    three();
}

translates into:

if (!c1)
    if (c2) {
        two();
    } else {
        three();
    } else {
        one();
    }

which is correct, but it is barely visible from the formatting that the last
else clause belongs to the first if statement. I would expect this (with or
without the braces):

if (!c1)
    if (c2) {
        two();
    } else {
        three();
    }
else {
    one();
}

Fixed for I20040928.

Corrected formatting. Now creates a block around top level thenPart iff original
thenPart was a Block but original else part was not:

if (!c1) {
    if (c2) {
        two();
    } else {
        three();
    }
} else {
    one();
}
