Go to the Java > Editor > Syntax preference page.
Change the keyword color to red.  Press Ok.  At this point, we use to see the 
preview update.  Not on this build (problem #1).

Press Ok, and close the pref dialog.
The java editor that was already open did not update.  I had to close it and 
reopen it for the colors to take effect (problem #2)
