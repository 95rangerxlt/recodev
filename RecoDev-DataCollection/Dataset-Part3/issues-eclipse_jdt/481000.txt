Unicode 7.0 support is slated to be one of the features for Java 9 (JEP 227). When it is confirmed, we should upgrade the compiler to support Unicode 7.0.

See bug 426214 for how it was done in 1.8.

We can set the target once it is confirmed.
Let me know if you need help with this. I can help you to generate the data files.

That'll be nice, Thanks! I will let you know when we have confirmation.
Jay, the latest Unicode version is 8.0.0. So I am sort of surprised that Java9 is limited itself to version 7.
This being said, do you have an update of the java.lang.Character javadoc as this will explain the changes that are expected to be done. I am wondering if new types of character should be considered for java identifier part or starts.
Thanks for clarifying that.
I have all the changes ready for Unicode 7.0. I can prepare Unicode 8 as well. Let me know how you want to proceed to get the changes.

You can attach the patch or commit it directly to the BETA_JAVA9 branch.

I am more than happy to do the committing part if you haven't got the branch up on you set up.
Thanks a lot for the patch, Olivier! I have submitted the patch with tests here:
