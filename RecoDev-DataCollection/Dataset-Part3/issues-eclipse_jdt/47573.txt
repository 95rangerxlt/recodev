The ability to work with strings that have already been externalized can 
seriously impove productivity especially when there are many references 
thoughout a project to a resource in a .properties file. The ability to 
refactor the key so that all references to it are changed aswell would save a 
great amount of time in this situation. The ability to change the markers for 
never translate strings would also be an improvement and to have a single 
properties file be common among many java files aswell.

Some editor or wizard that allows you to work with and manage .properties files 
that exist is needed not just a means of creating them.

Bugzilla 41823 shows some work that has been done on the Externalize Strings... 
Wizard but has run into problems with UI design.

There are plans to improve the NLS wizard in Eclipse for 3.0
Raising the serverity to level 1 because of WSAD customer demand. This feature 
needs to be in eclipse 3.0
William, please don't change the priority of a bug. This is reserved for 
developers to prioritize their work. 

I will check you is the person to coordinate WSAD requests for 3.0.
One additional clarification: P1 means that the bug has to be fixed for next 
integration/milestone build. And this will definitelly not happen for this 
bug ;-).
This gto implemented for M9 with the new externalize string wizard.
