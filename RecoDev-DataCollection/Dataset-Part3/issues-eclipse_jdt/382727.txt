The following program should trigger three errors about x, y and
args being redeclared. At the moment, (a) none of these usages are
complained against. (b) We also get a CCE from Parser.consumeEnterVariable.

// -------- 8< --------------


interface I {
  void foo(int x, int y);
}
public class X {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x, y;
    I i = (x, y) -> { // Error: x,y being redeclared
      int args = 10; //  Error args is being redeclared
    };
  }
}

I'll hook up the resolution code as a part of this fix and
then the fix for bug 382721 can proceed from there.

I have raised https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382841 to track
(b) since it is unrelated to (a)
Created attachment 225696
Test refinements for bug 382727 (and 38701)

More tests (they will not pass until bug 38701 is fixed, though)
Patches in Gerrit (may be easier to view patch and easier to check out from using Git)

Released these tests via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=370fc9797484c96c0e1fdf0a7794604c16e52ccb
Just a quick note that the spec committee has been asked to look into
this requirement and relax it.
I'll work on this next.
Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=4b84620f8d71e6de7e42a2050aa5360e2143f846.

I'll add a few more tests before closing.
Added several more tests that include testing of nested lambda and classes
inside lambdas(!).
