There is no code for checking whether given IPackageFragmentRoot exists. 
Simmilar problem is in Choose Source Dir dialog - it allows you to select 
project even if it is not a source folder.

I assume you are using setPackageFragmentRoot with a root that has no 
underlying resource.

In the wizard, we allow to specify non-folder toots. You can still create a 
class, but it will not be on a build path (the warnring informs you about that).
But, the root's underlying resource must exist.
