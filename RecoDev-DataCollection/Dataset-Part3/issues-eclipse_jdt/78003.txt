Tom, do you see the same?

That's really funny: we have bug 76087 which says it's too small (at least under
WinXp ;-).

I don't see this - the quick outline opens with its remembered size on my normal
workspace, and with the default size (which I find rather too small) on a fresh
workspace.

- Do you see this on a fresh workspace as well?
- What happens if you resize the outline to something reasonable, then close and
reopen it? It should remember the size you set.
I'm seeing different behavior at home then I saw at the office. I believe this is because I'm running 
Mandrake 10.0 at home and 10.1 at the office. I'll double-check this on 10.1 tomorrow.
If I resize the dialog, it correctly remembers the new size. However, the initial size is still enormous.
The problem is the different size computation of WinXP and Linux-GTK: Windows
has a default size for the tree while under Linux-GTK it simply grows by the
number of elements (that's why Tom could not reproduce and why Jared saw
different behavior).

Fixed together with bug 76087.
