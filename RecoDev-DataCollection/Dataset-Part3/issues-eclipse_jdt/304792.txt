Move more than one function between interfaces works fine. Moving a single function shows the message: "This refactoring cannot be used to move interface methods". 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a single function in the outline
2. Press refactor->move

Also reproduced with current 3.6 integration build I20100302-0800.
Move to JDT/UI
Note that even if you select two methods, it's not a refactoring (dialog title says 'Textual Move', and references are not updated).

Fixed in RefactoringAvailabilityTester (also allow textual move for single method from interface).
