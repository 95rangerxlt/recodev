- Ctrl+Click on the key on line 952:

=> just beeps but doesn't open the reference in IDEApplication#checkInstanceLocation(Shell). Problem is probably that the reference is in another plug-in.

Deepak, please have a look. I guess the search scope is confined to the declaring project. This is necessary for the textual search for performance reasons, but the Java search engine should be fast enough to do a full workspace search.

Fixed in HEAD.
