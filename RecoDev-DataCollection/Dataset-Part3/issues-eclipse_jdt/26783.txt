I find it rather annoying having put something into the clipboard and then 
pressing Ctrl+E to tidy up what is left behind after I have cut a certain piece 
of text and to my amazement the text I originally cut has been replaced with 
the blank lines that I wanted to remove. I belive that the cutting of the text 
into the clip board should be made optional or removed all together.

have a look at bug 27036 (http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=27036)
they claim they won't fix it.

We will look into enabling this feature only in emacs mode.
surely it is indipendant of the mode!
See #28591 for different needs in different modes.
Build >= 20030219.
Can I ask what exactly was the solution to this bug? When you press Ctrl+E in 
Emacs or anywhere else does that cut the text? Is there another keybinding 
option (Delete line with cut, and delete line)?
I just looked at 20030219, and it seems the same.
how can I delete a line without putting it into the clipboard? (I did not see a 
new keybinding option).
as far as I can tell Ctrl+E still cuts the text into the clipboard! The only 
difference I can see is that the key combination Ctrl+E seems to be clashing 
with something it says <undefined><conflict> for the command that it is mapped 
to.
Platform UI didn't give us the promised API. The code is in and waits to get 
uncommented.
