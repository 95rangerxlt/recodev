Sometimes I need to paste the full path of a resource (e.g. into a bug report). 'Copy Fully Qualified Name' which is currently disabled for resources could do that task.

Maybe we could even switch the label (e.g. 'Copy Full Path' for resources).

I don't want to mix the concepts for now. I still hope for a selectable status line.
Reopening to mark as dup.

Fixed in HEAD. It now also handles IResource.
