I normally work with "Link with Editor" switched off.

When editing a long method whose head is out of view, I want to know in which
method I am without leaving the editing position. I'd like to *double*click on
"Link with Editor" in the Java Outline to synchronize it with the current
position (the second click just disables "Link with Editor" again).

This works nicely with the Package Explorer, where a doubleclick on "Link with
Editor" reveals the current file. I think this doubleclick behavior should be
consistently supported by all "Link with Editor" actions.

Proposed patch.
Sorry for the cumbersome problem description above. The PR's summary should read:
"Link with Editor" in Java Outline should link on activation.

The goal is simply to establish the link to the actual edit position already
when the button is checked (and not only when the text cursor moves).
Patch rejected: it would cause an instable Java Outline page (see bug 40074).
