Ah, OK.  For some reason I interpreted it as something that happens while an
editor is being opened.
Does this work similarly to the "Enable folding" setting?  I find this to be
clear, without having the "when opening a new editor" suffix.

Can the setting be toggled on a per-editor basis after the editor is opened?  
If not, I would suggest just making it a global setting, rather than introducing
a temporal mode.

I'd also suggest clarifying the description, e.g. "Expand multiple annotations
on same line on hover" or "Hover expands multiple annotations on same line".

Fixed in HEAD.
