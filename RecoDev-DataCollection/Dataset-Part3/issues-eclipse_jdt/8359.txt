Build 20020122

When upgrading my self-hosted workspace from 0115 to 0122, I ended up replacing 
jdt.jar (using plugin import tool), and once finished - WITHOUT restarting, 
indexes still have references of JavaUIAction which no longer exists.

Testcase: open typde dialog still presents it.

We might have optimized too much unnecessary consistency checks...

Fixed by forcing the existing index to be deleted first when a jar is changed.
Reopening as this is not fixed if proj=src=bin.
In this case, the delta is incorrect: it is a non-java resource changed delta. 
As a result, re-indexing is not triggered.

Entered bug 9588 Invalid delta when replacing jar and proj=src=bin.
Closing this one.
