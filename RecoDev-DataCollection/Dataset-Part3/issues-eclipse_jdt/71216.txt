I'm using eclipse 3.0 build 200406251208. The Quick Fix 'Create method' (which 
is available when an undefined method is invoked) does not work when Cheetah 0.
0.6 is enabled; i.e. when activated, the Quick Fix does not insert a dummy 
method implementation. As soon as Cheetah is disabled, this feature works again.

Move to JDT/UI
This got fixed for the next I-Build (which will be available this week).
