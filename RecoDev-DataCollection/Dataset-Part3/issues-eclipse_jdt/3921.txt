If a selection can't be extracted because only a part of a statement is selected the errors message says:

	"Cannot extract new method from selection. Only statements from a method body can be extracted."

	Should be improved to say

	"Cannot extract new method from selection. Only >>whole<< statements from a method body can be extracted."

It is possible to extract expressions from a statement and
not only entire statements, e.g.,
int a= >>f()+g()+1<<

Therefore the error message isn't correct.
Options:
*   readjust the selection so that it covers the largest legal 
    extraction range.
*   improve the error message and give a hint what the user
    should do.
This should be solved by using the new context definable in a refactoring error
Still same old message in I20020226. Leaving P2

Improved wording of existing error messages plus added a context to the error 
message when possible.
