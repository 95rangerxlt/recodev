i had a big type hierarchy open
but put in the background - behind the package explorer

i added 1 type to the workspace
boom - tyhe whole thing froze for 2 minutes because the type hierarchy was 
doing a lot of work that i did not ask for

and no busy cursor
it makes it quite impossible to work if you have a type hierarchy open anywhere

Type hierarchy could do visiblity tracking as is now supported by the 
workbench. This is a really bad scenario when you have a large type hierarchy 
open.

need to investigate

The type hierarchy now only updated if it is visible
