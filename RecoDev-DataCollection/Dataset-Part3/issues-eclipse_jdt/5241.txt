Under some circumstances, I've had the following inserted
into my imports:  import org.omg.CORBA.OBJECT_NOT_EXIST;

I think this is a bug in code assist but I haven't been
able to replicate the steps yet.  I'll enter a new bug
report when I can.

In any case, some of us explicitly manage our imports.
For example, I beleive in using '*' instead of explictly
talking about a class because this allows the class to
move into a different package without me having to edit
the source.

I therefore NEVER want my imports changed automatically.

There is no auto inserting of imports except for refactoring (move CU),
you always have to invoke 'organize import' manually.

The bug of imports like 'org.omg.CORBA.OBJECT_NOT_EXIST' has been fixed in 203.
