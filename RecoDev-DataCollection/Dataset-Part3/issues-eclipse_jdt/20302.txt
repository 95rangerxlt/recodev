Build: F3
Steps:
*Select a project, bring up the properties dialog, select Libraries tab
*Click Add Variable
*Select the ECLIPSE_HOME variable, click Extend button
#1 - Why are files and folders mixed?  Folders should appear first.
more importantly:
#2 - Files and folders are not in alphabetical order, they appear in the order 
in which they were created.  

To Prove #2:
-create a folder called foo
-in foo, create a folder called A
-now create a folder called Z
-finally create a folder called C  

If you look at the contents of directory foo in the Variable Extension dialog, 
they appear in the order: A, Z, C.  I expect they would appear in order: A, C, Z

This problem renders this dialog unusable when you have a large number of files 
and folders in a directory.

undesirable but not critical enough for 2.0 - defer
fixed > 20020924
- filter added (now JARs only)
- sorter added (first fiolders, then files + alphabetic order)
