Clean up is slightly slower then the current implementation if a lot of changes are generated (i.e. format jdt/ui) and slightly faster if not much changes are generated. 
The problem when a lot of changes are generated is that the UI is not responding for quite a while when performing changes. This must be fixed first.

We've worked around this in Clean Up. Got fixed for 3.4 with bug 227098
