Eclise 3 Milestone 4

There is a java standard refering to comments, see link: 
http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc4.html chapter "5.1.1 
Block Comments" 
where it is described that block comments starting with "/*-" have a special 
format and they should not be formated

example: 

/*-
 * Here is a block comment with some very special
 * formatting that I want indent(1) to ignore.
 *
 *    one
 *        two
 *            three
 */

This comment should not be formated.

BTW: it's great that eclipse now has comment formatting :-)

Tobias, there should be a preference not to format block comments starting with
/*- (default: not formatting).
Good catch Kuki.

Note: "target milestone" is the build in which committers plan to provide this
feature - along with priority the field is reserved for committers.

Also, have a look at the keywords: "ui" and "usabilty" don't apply here (if in
doubt, look for other bugs marked with those keywords).
Thanks and I'll keep in mind for my seccond bug report :-)

Agreed with Tobias that we ignore those block comments without adding a
preference to format those.
