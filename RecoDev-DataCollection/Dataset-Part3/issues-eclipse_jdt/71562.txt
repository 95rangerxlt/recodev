There should be a variable that can be used to locate the type of object 
within a generic collection. For example in Set<String> the variable 
${collection_component} should resolve to String.  
 
This would be used in building a template for foreach iteration.  
 
for (final ${collection_component} str : ${collection}) { 
	System.out.println(str); 
} 
 
Then assuming this was invoked in the following method: 
 
public void someMethod(final Set<String> values) { 
    // invoked here 
} 
 
the result would be:  
 
public void someMethod(final Set<String> values) { 
    for (final String str : values) { 
        System.out.println(str); 
    } 
}

already started with this
blocked by bug 72097 since we don't get the parameter type information when
collecting completions.
