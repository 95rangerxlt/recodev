In the Classpath I could specify the Exclusion List. The complete list is sorted
by time.

Request: To sort this alphabetically.

Additonal Request: For adding some new dirs it would be appreciated to have the
same window as for the inclusion. Because then it would be easier to get an
overview.

Additional additonal Request: If this extra window, then why not to unite them
to have also in the exclusion list the already added components. But marked with
different icons (This I would see not SO high prior, but an alphabetically list
would be much more required!)

now sorted and both inclusions and exclusions in the same dialog (thanks for the
suggestion!)
