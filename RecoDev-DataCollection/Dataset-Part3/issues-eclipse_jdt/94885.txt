Although I can use the keyboard to move the cursor in the Java class editor, I
cannot scroll the editor. The scroll bars work fine.
There's PageUp/Down and Home/End.
java.vm.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.
java.vm.version=1.5.0-b64

It does not work for me (neither for others here). Those keys only move the
cursor. But the editor does not scroll up/down.

Not that should matter, but I am testing opening java.io.File when running
against a JRE (no source code available).
