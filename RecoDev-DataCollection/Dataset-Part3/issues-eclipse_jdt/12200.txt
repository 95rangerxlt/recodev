Using the 20020321 stable build:

public abstract class Test {
  
  public static final Test FOO = new Test() {
    public void foo() {
      int var = 1;
      System.out.print(var);
    }

  };
  
  public abstract void foo();

}

- highlight the var variable.

- select Refactor-Rename...

- you get a dialog for renaming FOO (instead of var)

looks like a code select issue - moving to JDT CORe
Probably a similar issue:

int var = 1;
int var2 = var;

- highlight var in the *second* line
- choose Refactor-Inline Local Variable...
- you get a dialog for inlining var2 (instead of var)
confirmed
it's not code select
added a regression test

can you give details on the inline problem?
i cannot reproduce with this test case:
  void f(){
  	int var = 1;
	int var2 = var;
  	
  }
inilining var is correct:
  void f(){
  	int var2 = 1;
  }
the rename problem was already fixed in the latest code
regarding the inlining-problem:

Did you highlight var in the *second* line?

	int var2 = *var*;

problem confirmed in 20020321 and fixed in the latest code

i added regression tests
