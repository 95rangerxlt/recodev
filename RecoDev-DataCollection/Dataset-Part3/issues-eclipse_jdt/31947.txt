Does search perform ok on next session ? We should be reindexing the affected 
pieces.
Added protection if the underlying random access file (raf) is null. Its 
possible while initializing an index that the instVar raf was never initialized.

Marking as fixed. A reproduceable case will likely show why the index couldn't 
be initialized in the first place.
