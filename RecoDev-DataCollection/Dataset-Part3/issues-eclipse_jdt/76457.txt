Operations that run in UI thread and only need to ensure that editor and CU are
in sync should use makeConsistent instead of reconcile. The reconciler will
later report the problems and get the AST.

Operations that run in UI thread and only need to ensure that editor and CU are
in sync should use makeConsistent instead of reconcile. The reconciler will
later report the problems and get the AST.
makeConsistent(...) does not help because there will be no Java element delta.
However, we could disable the problem reporting by deactivating the problem
requestor.
Fixed in HEAD.

Note: clients calling reconcile(...) and expecting an AST will now be broken
i.e. they will not get an AST. See bug 76738.
