Build ID: I20061214-1445

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a Java class with an inlined string.
2. Right-click the file - Source - Externalize strings
3. Select the inlined string in the list.
4. Click "Internalize". The icon in the leftmost column will turn into an arrow signifying that the string should be ignored. 
5. Click "Next". The wizard will tell that there's no work to do. Head back to the list.
6. Click "Ignore". The icon in the leftmost column will turn to a cross signifying that the string should be ignored. 
7. Click "Next". The wizard shows the appropriate actions to mark the string as internal using NON-NLS tags.

In short: The buttons seem to set the wrong values. Everything else works fine.

That's how it has to be:
 - 'Internalize' brings a string into the unprocessed state: No NLS mark, not NLS'ed. 
 - 'Ignore' will add the NON-NLS mark, signaling that string does not need a translation and can be ignored by the NLS-checker.

When the wizard starts up, it will suggest to externalize all your new string. Typically you will modify the key name, or maybe decide to 'ignore' the string. 'Internalize' is not useful here, it makes more sense on a already translated file that should be brought back in raw state (for example before you delete it or move it to a different project)

I know that the icons aren't optimal, but we couldn't find something better.

At least for non-native speakers, this is very confusing: The "internalize" button tells the wizard not to process (to ignore) the strings in this run while the "ignore" button tells the wizard to keep the strings in the source (that's what I understood when I read "internalize" for the first time). Even the authors of the QE2 (who are supposedly native speakers) book got this wrong, see page 582: "[...] clicking the Internalize button will tell the wizard to mark the string as nontranslatable [...] Clicking the Ignore button will cause the wizard to take no action."

Suggestion: Use the button descriptions as described in the on-line help for the wizard: "Translate", "Never Translate" and "Skip". Or at least keep the on-line help and the wizard in sync.
I updated the doc to use the terminology of the wizard and also added more explanations.

Note that the wizard can also process already translated strings. It's not only for strings to be translated. The buttons therefore name the 3 states that a string can be in (not the actions). We tried hard to come up with good names for these states.
