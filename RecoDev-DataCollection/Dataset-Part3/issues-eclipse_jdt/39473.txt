1. have a class, e.g.
public class MyAction implements IEditorActionDelegate {
    public void run(IAction action) {}

    void myMethod() {
        Runnable r= new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                Action a;
<HERE>          run(a);
            }
        }
    }
}

2. correctly, an error is displayed at <LINE>
3. Quickfix offers to create a local method matching the parameter, which is 
fine, but also:
- Change method run(IAction) to run(IAction) which is idempotent
- Create method run(IAction) in MyAction

The latter inserts a method run(Action) in the enclosing type which will be 
marked as a duplicate.

-> Enhancement and fix request: add quickfix "change to call to enclosing type" 
should produce the following code at <LINE>

MyAction.this.run(a);

Quick fix now suggests to add the qualifier
