public class Action<T> {
    public void f1(static Object o) {} 
    public void foo() {
          I in = (final int x, static strictfp public Object o) -> x;

}

here the lambda expression should have an error similar to the error at f1, according to JLS 15.27.1 (The syntax for formal parameters with declared types is the same as the syntax for the parameters of a method declaration (8.4.1))
ECJ currently accepts all modifiers

Looks like this is better implemented as part of the semantic checking.

Yes, once the formal parameters are type checked, this should automatically
fall in place. See that for methods and constructors also, we accept all
modifiers at the grammar level and reject the illegal ones as part of
semantic analysis.
We need to ensure this during argument resolution. Perhaps things would
already work as is once argument resolution code is hooked in - in any
case, we need tests to establish that.
Most of the fix was already in place (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382701#c47).

Added tests and some tweaks and released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=4ff905e78bafd71173d7f0334a042481d0575303
