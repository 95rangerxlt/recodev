- using integration build I20021114
- this is an intermittent problem and I haven't yet come up with a 
reproducible test case (gotta love these)
- am using default preferences (so Strings appear in bright blue and 
cntl+hover appears as bright blue and underlined)

I was cutting and pasting a number of lines into a class file.  Each line was 
of the form:
System.out.println("text with method or variable name");

Occassionally, when I pasted a line, the text in quotes would appear in black 
instead of blue.  Scrolling this code off the screen and back on again would 
not change the colour of the text.  Closing the class file and reopening it 
would cause the text to be in bright blue.  Occassionally, something next to 
the text would be in blue (don't remember if it was underlined as well) and 
would remain blue if it was scrolled off the screen and back on.

Hints (don't know if this helps):
- I was trying out cntl+hover at the same time 
- I find if I am cutting and pasting a lot, I tend to select some text, do 
cntl-C, lift my finger off the C but leave the cntl down, move to another spot 
with the mouse, press V (so I get cntl V because I still have the cntl down) 
to paste the text - i.e. I ride heavy on the cntl key (may need to get my 
brakes replaced - or is that breaks?)

I have never seen this recently - closing. Please reopen if you still see this.
