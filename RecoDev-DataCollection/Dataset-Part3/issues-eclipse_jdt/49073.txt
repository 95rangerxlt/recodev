Windows 2000, Eclipse 3.0 build id 200312162000
When I use incremental completion and the only one is a template the template
name is inserted instead of its content.
(I assign incremental completion to ctrl+space)
E.g.
ma<ctrl+space> produces: main - main method

When I select main from the popup window (when there are more possible
completions) template insertion is ok.

Note that per default Ctrl+Space is assigned to Content Assist - did you change
this?

Tom,
please comment
comment 0 sais ctrl+space is bound to incremental content assist.

Template proposals cannot be prefix-completed -> we need to return an empty
string from getCompletionText.
