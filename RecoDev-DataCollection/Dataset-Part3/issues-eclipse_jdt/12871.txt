Here are the scenarios I tested.

Scenario 1 - Bug is revealed
1. Highlight a JUnit test in the packages view.
2. Click the "Run" button.
3. Highlight another test in the packages view.
4. BUG...JUnit still has focus.

Scenario 2 - Bug is not present
1. Highlight a JUnit test in the packages view.
2. Click the "Run" button.
3. Click on any other window, besided packages view.
4. JUnit correctly gives up focus.

It seems that when JUnit is run, it won't give up the focus to view you just 
came from.

This seems to be a problem for me because I'll run my test, test is successful, 
then I'll try to run the next test or write some code. Can't do either because 
JUnit still has focus. Now, if I click on the title bar first, I don't have a 
problem, but I don't always remember to do that, nor do I want to have to 
remember...(old age).

Is the JUnit view a fast view or an ordinary view in these scenarios?
There is a focus issue. The JUnit result view should not take away focus when 
it is run. The view is only an "output" view and should behave like the console 
view or task view, i.e., simply show the output.

fixed so that the view no longer steals focus, this also fixes the problem in 
this bug.
