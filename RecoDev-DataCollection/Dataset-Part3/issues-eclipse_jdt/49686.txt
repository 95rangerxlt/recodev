(word boundaries) are removed, or additional spaces are introduced. Examples:

/**
 * Test comment. Hold your <code>hope</code>s high.
 */

This gets changed to:

/**
 * Test comment. Hold your <code>hope</code>
 * s high.
 */

Another example:

/**
 * Test comment. {@link Object} rocks.
 */

This gets changed to:

/**
 * Test comment. {@link Object}rocks.
 */

My Javadoc formatter options:

[x] Format Comments
    [ ] Format header comment
    [x] Format HTML tags
    [x] Format Java code snippets
    [ ] Clear all blank lines
    [x] Empty line before Javadoc tag block
    [ ] New line after Javadoc tag parameters
    [x] Indent Javadoc tags
    [x] Indent Javadoc parameter descriptions

This happens on 3.0M6.

One thing which should also be considered:

Text inside <pre></pre> should be left as is even with "Format HTML tags" on.

    /**
     * <pre>Hello</pre>
     */
    void test() {

    }

Should be left as is, instead of (with "Format HTML tags"):

    /**
     * <pre>
     *  Hello</pre>
     */
    void test() {

    }

The above will produce different HTML than the original.

the test
  asdf <b>asdf</b> asdf
is currently formatted to
  asdf <b>asdf </b> asdf
which is not quite incorrect, but the space before the "</b>" wasn't intended.

Also situations like
  x<b>y</b>z
are totally mishandled. The result is
  x <b>y </b>z

Another thing to consider:

/**{EOL}
 *{EOL}
 * Test{EOL}
 *{EOL}
 * Test{EOL}
 */

Will be reformatted to:

/**{EOL}
 * {EOL}
 * Test{EOL}
 * {EOL}
 * Test{EOL}
 */

A whitespace should not be insered on lines having EOL right after *.
We ran into this too (space eaten after @link).

Another example:

 */

will be rendered to

/**
 * @author <a href="mailto:my@name.org">My Name </a>
 */

Ho Ho Ho!

Fixed any additional or missing whitespace inside tags (comment 0, comment 15
and comment 23) as well as the inline tag issues (comment 0 and millions of
duplicates).

Did not look into the <pre> tag issues (comment 8), but this is covered in bug
52921.

Comment 18 is invalid IMO, the javadoc standard is to indent with an asterix and
one space (except for the 1.4 issue tracked in bug 51691).

Marking as fixed > 20041221.

Why hasn't it been fixed for Eclipse 3.0.2?

Doesn't seem like this bug is fixed. I still get the problem with in-line tags
in Eclipse 3.0.2 Build id: 200503110845 on Windows XP. Please have a look at
this again.
It's fixed in 3.2 not 3.0.2
This appears to be an issue again.  When I click source-format it reformats my javadoc as follows (with indented space on the second/third lines):

    /**
         * Admin List objects
         */

I'm using Eclipse 3.2.1.
