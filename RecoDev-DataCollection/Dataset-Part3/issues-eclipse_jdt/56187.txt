class Test {
  Vector[] data = null;
  void m() {
    String[] data2 = null;
    
  }
}

when inserting a fo ctrl-space after data2 and selecting for with temporary 
variable the forloop is templated to the file. you can tab through the 
different fields and rename them. when renaming the data2 to data the type of 
the temporary variable should change to Vector.
