	This is a binary compatibility test. You need to compile the test cases 
in the same order I put them below one by one. And then execute it. The problem 
with the Eclipse
	compiler occurs only at runtime.

Test cases:
	javac 1.4:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: passed with java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError

	javac 1.3:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

	Eclipse compiler:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

NOTES:

	The reference to the field f through the getfield bytecodes is 
different again.

Adapted to this change for 1.4 mode only.
Fixed
