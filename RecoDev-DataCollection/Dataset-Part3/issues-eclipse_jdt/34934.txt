Drag support is not consistent for all JDT UI views:

package explorer: support file, resource and selection transfer
type hierarchy: only selection transfer is supports. Hence non DnD
  from type hierarchy to workbench parts (e.g the editor, navigator) or to 
  another application.
Java outliner: same as type hierarchy
browsing perspective: no file transfer hence no DnD to another application.

Not for 2.1
Should be easy to implement...

fix

Call and Type hierarchy do not support file drop, which is reasonable since they don't show a valid target anyway.
