PE using abbreviation pattern

OSX 10.4.11
I20100426-0852

1. Create a project containing a package foo.bar.test
2. Define abbreviation patterns:
foo.bar=BAR
BAR=foo.bar

IS: looks like the package name spans multiple lines (new line in package name). See screen shot

PE with using abbreviation pattern on XP

Hmm, I see this on Windows XP (with Build id: I20100426-0852) which looks good to me.

Have you tried giving only 'foo.bar=BAR' as the pattern?

Yes, it works when using only one pattern.
It looks strange as shown in the screen shot as soon as I define more then one pattern.
I'll investigate for M7. Looks like a bug in the pattern splitting implementation (and the Mac renders multi-line strings in more places than Windows).
I can't reproduce with OS X 10.6.3, but it looks like the problem is that 10.4 still uses \r as line delimiter.

Fixed in HEAD of JavaElementLabelComposer.
Still looks good on I20100429-0206 WinXP. Benno, please verify in M7.
