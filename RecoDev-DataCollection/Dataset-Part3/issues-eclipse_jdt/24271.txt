In Eclipse 1.0, packages and simple folders were not sorted together within the 
Project (as the source folder).  Packages were (sorted) and placed first, 
followed by simple folders (that were also sorted).

In Eclipse 2.0, the packages and simple folders are sorted together within the 
Project (as the source folder).  Unfortunately, if you use Source Folders the 
packages and source folders are sorted as described above in Eclipse 1.0.

It would be useful for packages and simple folders to be sorted together within 
their Source Folder.

Martin, i guess you're the sort master 
As clarification: The problem here is simply one of consistency.  Whether I 
decide to use the project or source folders, my packages/folders should be 
sorted the same way.
dani plans to change this
Fixed the code to treat folders and packages the same. We also investigate in
changing the folder icon (which is shown when the package is empty but has
resources): The idea is to show a (empty?) package icon with some sort of folder
adornment.

Released to HEAD.
