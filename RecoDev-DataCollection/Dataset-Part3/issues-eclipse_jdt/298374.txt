In M4 SDK, 
org.junit4.source_4.7.0.v20091207.jar 
actually has no "source" ... that is, no "java" files, to be "found" in SDK. 
It does repeat some property files, etc., but those are not needed (since in the "runtime" version of bundle, org.junit4. 

generateSourceBundle=false

may have to go in the build.properties, I'm guessing? BUT, see also bug 298239, as fixing it, might fix this one?

Since this bundle doesn't contain any code, I think we should just not generate a source bundle for it (using generateSourceBundle=false).

patch
Moving to jdt ui since they own the junit4 bundle.
Makes sense, released and tagged.
