3.0 build 20040226

The following changes would improve the user experience for
running JUnit tests:
- At the earliest possible moment, reset the red/green bar and all the info 
pertaining to the last test run. Right now, it does not do this anywhere soon 
enough (waits until after launching), making it hard to tell whether the tests 
were even launched successfully.
- Incorporate the time at which the last run started or completed. This would 
allow the the user to determine that the results they are looking are 
fresh/stale. This is expecially important when the JUint view is not always 
visible to the user, such as when it's a fast view.

Jim welcome to JUnit in Eclipse<g> these are good suggestions.

1) the launching feedback should be shown in the progress bar directly and not 
only in the status line or in the table.

2) the start time should be shown in the view above the results part.
Moving back to the JDT/UI inbox
Has been fixed in the 3.2 cycle:
1) new test run is created and shown before second vm is launched
2) start time is shown for each launch in history menu
