*** Bug 14532 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
The bug 14478 doesn't sound duplicate. The Bug 14532 has nothing to do with a
liked to have color (yellow or red) of something underlineing.

I know that the "old" similar bug had something to do with the syntax
highlighting alg. Am I right?
I think it would be useful to have a way to filter out some types of warnings
from the right side of the editor (deprecation warnings come to my mind).
Maybe use the compiler preferences to find out what should be ignored/colored in
yellow/red.
