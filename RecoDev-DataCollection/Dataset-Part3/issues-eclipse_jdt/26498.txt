Build 20021114

1. Disable filtering of empty packages
2. Select an empty package which is not a leaf (e.g. junit.samples)
2. Delete it

==> no feedback, nothing happens.

I see two solutions
1) Dialog informs the user about the fact that this thing can't be removed
2) Dialog asks the user if he want to delete everything below two

This wasn't an issue so far but when deleting empty nodes in the Package
Explorer with hierarchical layout it is weird to get no feedback.

in the junit.samples the package isn't empty and the behaviour is correct its 
contents is deleted. The problem only shows up when the "Fold empty packages is 
not set.

Therefore a minimal fix to show a dialog when the package is empty and nothing 
will be deleted is sufficient.
how about disabling 'delete' on these packages?
nobody yells, so i will disable 'delete' on these packages
