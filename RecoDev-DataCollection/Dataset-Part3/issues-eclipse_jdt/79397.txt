I use the following template:
${cursor}${type}Home aHome = ${type}Util.getLocalHome();
${type}Local aLocal = aHome.create();
but the editor displays it all on one line (the line break in the template does
not show up in the editor).

If I insert an extra line break between the two lines, it displays with the
extra line break in the editor.

I have the same problem in Windows XP SP1 (JDK 1.4.2) and Fedora Core 3 linux
(JDK 1.5.0-b64).

The problem is that the Java code formatter formats the given statements onto
one line. If you uncheck "Use code formatter" on the templates page, everything
works as expected.

I am not quite sure where the problem is in the formatter, because your template
produces syntactically correct java which should not be a problem. Formatting a
CU after inserting the template produces the expected results as well.

Replacing K_UNKNOWN with K_STATEMENTS in
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.template.java.JavaFormatter.plainFormat() fixes
the problem - so why does the formatter fail to detect that the template is two
statements? We must put K_UNKNOWN at that location since a template can contain
anything.
appears to be fixed > 20060120 - please reopen if you find otherwise.
