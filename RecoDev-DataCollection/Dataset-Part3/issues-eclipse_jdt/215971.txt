Build ID: M20071023-1652

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Use code completion in javadoc (e.g. for a @link) to a class which is not in the current package and not used in the code. 

2.
Note that an import is added. The import is not reflected in the code, so is invalid - the javadoc should instead use a fully qualified name. Organise imports will remove this import, so the link in the javadoc will be invalid - See bug #92821 for details.

Changing the scope of this after re-reading the docs -- this only applies to package javadocs.

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#seesearchorder states that all names in javadoc should be fully qualified in "(package.html or package-info.java) or overview file (overview.html)". The above reference points to the search order of @see; @link refers to this.
