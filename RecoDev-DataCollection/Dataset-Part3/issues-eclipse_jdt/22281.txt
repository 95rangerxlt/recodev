If you have a binary class that has attached source and you try to edit the 
file there is no indication that this file is read only in the editor. This may 
confuse many users. (like me) There should be some kind of notification that 
this file is read only. (Maybe as a line at bottom of the editor, or in the 
status bar, or an infopop that automatically comes up when you start to type, 
or in the editor's title (but this won't work as well since it can be obscured 
by other editor tabs))

To reproduce: Open a class file produced by the eclipse builder. As the class 
file is writable the editor indication is writable but the class file editor 
does not allow changes.

Not a dup.
Fixed in HEAD: the status line correctly shows the read-only indication.
