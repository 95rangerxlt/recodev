ExecutionEnvironmentDescription doesn't preserve the order of VM arguments provided in a .ee file (since it uses a plain HashMap), and the test org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests.core.EEDefinitionTests.testVMArguments() happens to test a combination of VM arguments which under 1.7 just happens to hash in the tested order.
Under 1.8 this false positive doesn't happen.

I'm supplying a patch which rectifies this.

Fix order of VM arguments

This patch fixes the test to increase the likelyhood of finding order mismatch,
and fixes the hashmap to preserve the key order.
