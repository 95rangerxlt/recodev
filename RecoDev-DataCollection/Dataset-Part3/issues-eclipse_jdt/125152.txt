I have two projects "Project1" and "Dependency1" which is a "Required project on the build path" for the first.

When "Dependency1" is renamed to "NewName1" I get the error:

Build path entry is missing : /Dependency1

The expected behavior would be that Eclipse updates the build path entries of referencing projects, so that the user may not be forced to update manually the out of sync entries.

I just noticed that for some (but not all) projects the build path will be updated. But the export flag for these projects will be not set.
Moving to JDT UI (IPackageFragmentRoot#move(...) provides flags to control this behavior)
Flags like isExported, access restrictions, etc. were indeed not correctly updated. Also, undo did not undo the classpath changes. I fixed these problems in HEAD.

However, I could not reproduce the problem in comment 1. Victor, can you provide more precise steps to reproduce?

IPackageFragmentRoot#move(...) has nothing to do with this - the bug is about renaming an IJavaProject.


(In reply to comment #3):

For some projects "Dependency1" would have been updated to "NewName1".
But the export flag in the "Order and Export" flag will default to unset even if it was set before.

(Maybe a workspace issue? This one is about 1.5 years old.)
Oops, sorry, I meant: I could not reproduce the problem in comment 0 (not 1).
I fixed the bug with the missing export flag, but I could not reproduce the problem with not updated project names on the build path.

Are you sure that you didn't uncheck 'Update References' or used Undo to make this happen? That the workspace is not brand-new should not influence this refactoring at all.

I'll mark this bug as fixed for now. Please reopen if you have steps to reproduce the problem from comment 0, or if you think the problem with unset export flags is not solved in next week's integration build.
