JavaDoc tags.
Same is true for static and non-static methods.

Adapted summary.

Acctually this is only true when:
- using drag-and-drop with class members
or
- selecting multiple members in the package explorer and invoking Move from the
context menu
or
- moving an instance field

In all cases it also holds for references in Java code. Adapted summary again.

Markus, we should look into this for 3.0. Options are:

- we implement the move correctly (time permitted)
- we disable the actions in the Refactor->Move context menu, but allow 
  DnD
- we make it more clear in the dialog that this refactoring doesn't
  support reference updating. The problem with this is that a refactoring
  with reference updating support isn't really a refactoring.

Markus, any comments.
I strongly opt for:
- we make it more clear in the dialog that this refactoring doesn't
  support reference updating. The problem with this is that a refactoring
  with reference updating support isn't really a refactoring.

I'd add a comment to the reorg move dialog saying "References to the moved
element will not be updated." (plural when applicable). This should make clear
that we don't have a real refactoring for the job, and it doesn't restrict a
convenient functionality. It's also better than showing a disabled and unchecked
"Update References" checkbox which would be a pain to read.
Title of move dialog is now "Textual Move" iff references cannot be updated.
