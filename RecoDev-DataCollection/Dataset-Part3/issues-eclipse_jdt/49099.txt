The reduced search menu preference (work in progress) does too much and
therefore I cannot use it:

Exmples:
- select an interface (in outline or any other view where you already know it is
an interface. Try to search for implementors ==> not possible.
- same applies for fields: it is no longer possible to search for read/write access.

- agree on first item.
- search for read/write will go away with the new search anyway. It will
  be included in the result.
We will keep the "Use Reduces Search Menu" option for 3.0.

Thomas, as dicussed can you please move the option from Work in Progress to 
the Java Page.
Moved the preference to the java base page.
