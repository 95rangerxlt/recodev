When I export to a Mac OS X Application Bundle, Java 5.0 is not offered as a JVM, even though I have installed Java 5 from Apple. I only see up through Java 1.4. I see this issue in both 3.1.2 and 3.2RC7.

I believe JDT owns this wizard.

i had this bug and it is really a bug because when my default jvm is the 5.0 vm and i chose 1.4 bundle (5.0 is not available) i cannot launch the generated app (classes in the jar are 5.0 version and the application is defined as 1.4 java application...). the only way i found to launch it is to change manually in the info.plist the java version property...
I was advised in a private email to use Eclipse's RCP (Rich Client Platform) export to create a standalone application. However, to do this, one must distribute at minimum two eclipse plug-ins. I am doing pure standard Java and Swing, and do not want these eclpse plug ins or SWT or anything like that. I am still hoping the Export Mac OS X Application Bundle can be fixed to offer Java 5.
What's the status on this? Is it going to be fixed. I see several people have voted for the bug.

Thanks
