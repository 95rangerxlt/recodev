Build ID: M20080911-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Add javaCompletionProposalSorters extension point
2. Add proposalSorter
3. Implement your proposal sorter
4. Test sorter: Open preferences and choose your sorter (Java->Editor->Content Assist->Sort proposals)
5. Even though it is chosen, your sorter will not execute and you can see NPE in log: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ProposalSorterHandle.sortProposals(ProposalSorterHandle.java:191) 

More information:
The reason why it doesn't work is that ProposalSorterHandle instance has "activate" field set to false. To fix this, you must manually edit your plugin.xml and add activate="true" attribute to proposalSorter element.

XSD should be enhanced to contain 'activate' attribute and UI should be enhanced to offer activate combo with true/false as other extensions do (e.g. javaCompletionProposalComputer).

For test purposes please attach your sorter along with the plugin.xml here.
