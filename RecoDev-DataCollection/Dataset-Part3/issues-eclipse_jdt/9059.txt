There are a number of popup options on the java editor popup. It would be 
useful if there was a "quicker" way to access some of them. For example 
comment/uncomment.

I notice also that some of the pop up operations do not have mnuemonics so this 
would partly help.

Another option is to have a toolbar group for java edit that exposes some of 
the actions.

the actions are now also availble from the menubar.
The menu proposal we implement will also define a short cut for comment ctrl/.
Closing this bug since implementing the menu proposal is on the M6 plan.
