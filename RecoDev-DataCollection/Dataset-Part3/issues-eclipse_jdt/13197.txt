i guess it simply copies the visibility from the superclass
It was explained to me that this maybe is not a bug but a feature. I suppose it 
is a rather unclear feature. Maybe it would be nicer to have an option to 
inherit the constructor with the same or public visibility.
we should change the default to be generate a public constructor and not trying 
to be too smart here.
