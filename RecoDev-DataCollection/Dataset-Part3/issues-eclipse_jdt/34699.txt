All of the actions have a help context ID associated with them. I don't know 
the reason for the different behavior of two actions where both have a help 
context id. One of the guesses is that it is caused by whether the id is 
listed in the xml file.

Fixed all mentioned problems and added dummy help text to the context xml files.
This dummy text must be replaced by real content (see bug 35211 and bug 35212 ).
