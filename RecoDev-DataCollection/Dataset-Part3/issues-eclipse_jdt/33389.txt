Need to check what happens before moving PR.
That the action is enabled is because of AdaptedSourceViewer:

public boolean canDoOperation(int operation) {
 if (operation == CORRECTIONASSIST_PROPOSALS)
  return true;
 return super.canDoOperation(operation);
}

Checkbox behavior has been fixed. See bug 32826.
Please change enabling behavior or close.
