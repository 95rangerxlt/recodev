Test Case:
1. enable to insert single proposals automatically
2. enable incremental completion
3. have:
public class Foo {
	class URIUtil {}
	void foo() {
		URI uri= uri<code assist>
	}
}

==> no proposals.

Incremental completion tries to be smart and sort of case-sensitive. If there is exactly one case-sensitive match with the prefix then the proposal is inserted and no list shown.

While this is acceptable when completing 'ur'<code assist>
=> uri
It is not OK if code assist is invoked after 'uri'.

NOTE: my fix will not solve the following issue:
hash<code assist> inserts hashCode() directly and does not show the available types with different casing.

A better fix would be to pull out the non-standard case-sensitive behavior from incremental code assist but that might be too disruptive for existing users that are used to this now, especially because there is no preference to enable case-sensitive for code assist (bug 25305).
Fixed in HEAD.
