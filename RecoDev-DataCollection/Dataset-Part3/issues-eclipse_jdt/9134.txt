When there is a syntax problem in the code somewhere above the cursor, and you 
try to invoke code assist, nothing happens. Not an error message, nothing.

If it is not possible to invoke code assist even though the code is not 
correct, there should be at least some kind of information about this. Perhaps 
a "tooltip" message instead of the code assist window informing about the 
problem, or a message in the status bar in the bottom of the window. Anything, 
please. :-)

Also, if code assist "discovers" that there is a syntax error in the code, why 
doesn't the incorrect line get marked with a red X? This, too, could help the 
user understand why the code assist fails.

Since a couple of weeks we support problem highlighting in the Java editor. 
This shows you all the problems that might hinder content assist from proposing 
completions to you.
