Why don't you want the trailing comment to be part of the expression?
This will be fixed in the new parser I intent to release for the next 
integration build. If you have code that is a workaround of this problem, let me 
know.
Fixed and released in HEAD. The comment is no longer part of the postfix 
expression.
