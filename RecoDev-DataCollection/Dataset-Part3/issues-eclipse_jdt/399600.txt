From bug 391895, comment #29:

The *existing* method ASTConverter#retrieveEndOfRightParenthesisPosition 
is totally bogus and will fail for a test case like:

public class X {
 	static void foo(@ReadOnly("Blah") int z) { 
 		
 	} 
}

@interface ReadOnly {
	String value() default "Blah";
}

The method must discount balanced parentheses.

Created attachment 226437
Patch with test

The buggy method is causing extra dimensions to be ignored in the following case:

int foo(@Marker(\"Blah\") int z) @Marker [] @Marker [] {
    return null;
}

Will release after running the tests.
Tests are green and I have pushed the fix to BETA_JAVA8.

Srikanth, it's a minor fix. If you would like to review it, it's here:
