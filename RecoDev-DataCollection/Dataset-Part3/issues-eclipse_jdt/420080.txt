Thanks, I'll take a stab at it.
Smaller test case:

// --
public class X extends G implements I {
}

interface I {
	default int foo (){
		return 0;
	}
}

class G {
	public int foo() {
		return 0;
	}
}

X does not have a method that overrides I.foo.

I believe reporting this as an error is the expected outcome.
Do you want me to dig out the paragraph in the spec?
I was a bit too quick, let me back up:

// Three interfaces:
interface I {
	default int foo (){
 		return 0;
	}
}
interface IG {
	public int foo();
}
interface IX extends I, IG {
}

Here ecj and javac agree to reject IX:

"The default method foo() inherited from I conflicts with another method inherited from IG"

This is because "It is a compile-time error if an interface I inherits a default method whose signature is override-equivalent with another method inherited by I. This is the case whether the other method is abstract or default." (9.4.1)


Where ecj and javac disagree is the case of classes. For this case the spec says: "It is a compile-time error if a class C inherits a default method whose signature is override-equivalent with another method inherited by C, unless there exists an abstract method declared in a superclass of C and inherited by C that is override-equivalent with the two methods." (8.4.8.4)

Question is: does X inherit both methods?

This seems to be true for the following case:

// Two interfaces, one class
interface I {
	default int foo (){
		return 0;
	}
}
interface IG {
	public int foo();
}
abstract class X implements I, IG {
}

Again ecj and javac agree to reject.

Difference occurs only with one interface and two classes (comment 2).

Why is this different? In the example from comment 2 X does *not* inherit I.foo because X already inherits a concrete method (G.foo) with override equivalent signature (see 8.4.8).

=> ecj is wrong.

For completeness: when changing G.foo to abstract (and hence also G and X), then both methods are inherited, but the exception from above applies ("unless there exists an abstract method declared in a superclass of C and inherited by C that is override-equivalent with the two methods."). To witness:

// One interface, two classes, super class method is abstract:

interface I {
	default int foo (){
		return 0;
	}
}
abstract class G {
	abstract public int foo();
}
abstract class X extends G implements I {
}

This is accepted by both compilers.


My guess is: MethodVerifier15.checkInheritedMethods() is correct, but perhaps MethodVerifier.computeInheritedMethods() must be changed. The latter method has not been significantly changed in BETA_JAVA8 except for for static interface methods.
Can a solution wait till after ECE?

I guess it will have to - I did spend some time on it, but it is going to 
require more time than I have. 

I noticed that some of the state maintained in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.MethodVerifier15.checkInheritedMethods(MethodBinding[], int, boolean[]) may not be appropriate for a fix. I think
we need a nested loop there.

Stephan, I request this to be prioritized above part G work. Thanks.

ack.
As a quick measure I'm adding a new "boolean[] isInherited" into checkMethods().
This is populated by a special check inside isSkippableOrOverridden() to reflect the new rule in 8.4.8.
Methods marked as not-inherited are then skipped during check for name clash.
(This two-step process basically corresponds to the nested loops mentioned in comment 6, I guess - without adding a new loop :) )

Ideally, in some leisure moment I'd attempt a rewrite of checkMethods() to look more like the new specification. I have to admit, I don't fully understand, e.g., the business of skip[idx], which is only checked in the i-loop, not in the j-loop (look for "second round"). This is (modulo refactorings done for default methods) essentially inherited from our predecessors, and it feels more and more clumsy when comparing to the current spec.
But it seems that every single bug in method verification can be causes in this single method. Ergo, such a rewrite is a major tasks of its own.

I was telling Jay just a week ago that we should rewrite the entire method
contract verification code. After Java 8 work is complete we can look into this
and based on workload at that time decide who can work on it.

Thanks !
