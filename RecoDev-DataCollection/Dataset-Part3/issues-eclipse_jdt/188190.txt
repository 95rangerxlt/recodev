The help documentation for the JDT compiler should be updated to describe the options added for Java 6 annotation processing.  Specifically, the batch compiler guide (jdt_api_compile.htm) should document the -proc:only, -proc:none, -processorpath, -processor, and -s options.

Proposed patch to documentation

Here's the text I propose.  Is it okay to link to javadoc for the Java 1.6 API, on java.sun.com?
Patch looks good to me. Linking to sun doc makes sense to me since the user will need to look at this doc anyway.
Do you know if doc changes need to be reviewed ?
The endgame plan says "Ongoing changes to component documentation do not require special approval."  I'll go ahead and release this.
