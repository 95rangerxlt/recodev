tried in 20020514 and {@link T<code assist> works for me.
pls provide reproducable steps.
Apparently it is already fixed.
But why the content assist disappears when I type characters after
it has opened (and there is valid completion) ?
we have a separate bug for this problem 15264, pls check this bug and add your 
scenarion when it is different - closing this bug
Verified.
