	generete getters/setters uses out naming policy that all field names start with f
	if you create a getter for a field fFred
	the javadoc comments says "Gets the fred"
	how does it know that the leading f does not mean anything and can be ommited in the comment?
	it makes the same assumption for all one-letter lowercase prefixes

	it should not try to be too smart and just say "Gets fFred." (needs a period at the end)

	in other companies the leading f or anything might have some totally different meaning and generating 
	a comment without it will be very inappropriate

NOTES:
EG (7/12/01 10:57:38 AM)
	make it a preference, low prio
