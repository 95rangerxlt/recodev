I have the following source

	/**@see org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.Recyclable#recycle()*/
	public void recycle() {
		super.recycle();
	}

The following warning is reported:

Javadoc: Malformed reference (missing separator after method reference closing
brace)

If I add a space after the #recycle() no warning is reported:

	/**@see org.apache.avalon.excalibur.pool.Recyclable#recycle() */

I think this warning shouldn't be issued.

There must be a white space character after the @see reference otherwise Javadoc
will generate a warning...
But of course compiler should not complain when there's comment end characters
even if there are stuck to reference...
Fixed.

Compiler does not longer complain on this syntax.
