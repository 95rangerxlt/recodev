Predefined SWT templates should use ${X:newType(...)} for all used types. I just used the Button template and was left with a compile error because Button has not been imported.

Markus? Do you have steps to reproduce this? Did you have an import for a conflicting 'Button' type? The newName variable should make sure that Button is imported. The new type variable would only ensure, that the types are fully qualified if a conflicting type is already imported. But this is very unlikely to happen.

Reason was that awt Button was already imported.
