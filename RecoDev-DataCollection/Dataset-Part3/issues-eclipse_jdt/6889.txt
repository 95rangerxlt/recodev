1. Create
    public class A {
	public class B extends java.util.Vector {
	}
    }
2. open B in type hierarchy, turn on 'Show All Inherited Members'
3. -> There is no supertype hierarchy of B, 'Object' missing
      typeHierarchy.getSuperTypes('B') returns an empty array
4. -> The inherited methods are complete
      typeHierarchy.getAllSuperTypes('B') returns results

Did you save the working copy prior to opening the hierarchy ?
Yes, everything saved.
*** Bug 6898 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

Fixed by finding the outer most type first.
