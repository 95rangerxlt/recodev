I2003-03-24 + plugin export

1) open content assist and make the window as small as you can
2) open content assist again such that you get a javadoc hover on the right of
the content assist window.
3) drag the lower right corner of the content assist window to make the window
bigger.
4) observe: the content assist window disappears under the hover. 

This is a totally bogus corner case, but the fact that we're not relayouting the
windows may have worse consequences in other places, hence this bug.

No regression (step 1 which store the size is not needed).

We should close the additional info pop-up as soon as we resize. And maybe show
it after resize is complete.

Done.

> And maybe show it after resize is complete.
We now show it again after a timeout (even while the user is resizing) using the same timeout as when the user selects another proposal.
