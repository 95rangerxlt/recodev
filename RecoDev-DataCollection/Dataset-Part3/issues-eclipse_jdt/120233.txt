When changing the generated source directory to invalid value such as a extrememyl long name or "../" the APT process fails quietly with errors logge din the error view. Changing these values back to valid values does not fix the problem, the APT process never recovers, it seems to be in an invalid state. Restarting eclipse doesn't fix the problem.

Repro steps:
1/ Project Properties --> Java Compiler --> Annotation processing --> Generated source Directory to "../" 
2/ Hit appply. (Generated src directory disappears from resource view)
3/ Repeat step one but put in valid path

Notes: The main problem here is that it's impossble for the user to recover from this, if the user could go back type in a valid directory and get back to a working state this would be ok. 

To avoid this unstable situation maybe there should be some checking for invalid values in this field, especially for extremely long directory names as there seems to be no limit only what is imposed by the OS at dir creation time.
See also bug 105353.  It is nigh on impossible to validate directory names in platform-independent code, but as Adrian suggests, we should certainly be able to recover from the error.
We now do a better job of validating, so I'm not sure how to test this without code modification; but I checked this before I enabled the validation code and it seems to be fixed due to the GeneratedSourceFolderManager refactoring.
