To complete the plan item to deliver ICU4J support in the Eclipse (see bug
127876) code must be migrated to use the com.ibm.icu.* classes in place of the
default java implementation.  This component is affected.  I will attach
patches with the changes required (only import changes at this point).  This
needs to be done for M6.

Created attachment 36699
archive of patches for affected JDT UI projects

There is a patch file for each affected project, named accordingly.
Released patch into HEAD
Karice, why do we have to specify the plugin dependency as
"Import-Package: com.ibm.icu.text"?

Is there something special about that plugin that prevents the usual "Require-Bundle:"?

Yes there is something special.  Basically, there is a replacement plugin available (com.ibm.icu.base) that you can drop in place of ICU4J if the size of your application is more important to you than adopting ICU4J function (mainly RCP apps).  So using require-bundle will break people who use the replacement plugin.  The replacement plugin contains a subset of the ICU4J APIS and the package/class structure is the same, but instead the implementation simply calls the default Java implementation rather than the ICU implementation.
I see, thanks for the explanation.
