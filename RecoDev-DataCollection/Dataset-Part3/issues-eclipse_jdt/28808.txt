The "Override/Implement methods..." pop up menu option should mark the created 
method as "Refactor".  

Technically, this is not a refactoring.  There should be another default marker 
called "To Do" or something like that.

We should use a "macro" for the body so that clients can customize the body. So 
they would be able to generate a body with a to do tag which then would appear 
in the task list.

Martin, I am assigning this to you since you know most abaut the plans 
regarding macro support for 2.x. 
You can now specify the content of the generated method stubs. This means you 
can add a TODO tag
