When right clicking anywhere in java code, the context menu that comes up
includes a "Refactor" submenu. This (currently) has 12 elements (in 3 groups of
4) most - if not all - of which will be inapplicable in a particular context
(some are mutually exclusive, I believe).

When picking an inapplicable option, an alert comes up explaining that you
cannot perform this action on a current selection. It would be better and more
user friendly to not show inapplicable options for the current selection/cursor
position. If this is not possible, perhaps the invalid choices could be grayed out.

The problem is that we have to build an AST to compute the enable/disable 
state. And creating an AST is expensive. We are investigating options to do 
this during reconcile but aren't sure yet that it will happen for 3.0.
Got addessed for M6.
