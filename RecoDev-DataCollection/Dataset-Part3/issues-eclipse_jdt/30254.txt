build I20030115

In a method like:
	/**
	 * First line.
	 * Second line.
	 */
	void m() {}

Move the cursor to the start of the "Second line" in the Javadoc (column 1).
Hit Enter, as if you want to enter a new line.
You get the following, with | indicating the current cursor position.

	/**
	 * First line.

	 * |	 * Second line.
	 */

It should give:

	/**
	 * First line.
	 * |
	 * Second line.
	 */

fixed > 20040916
Verified the fix in I20040921200. There are no longer 2 stars on the same line
but the result is not as indicated after "It should give:". Instead you get:

	/**
	 * First line.

	 * <caret>Second line.
	 */

If this is not what you expect then please reopen the bug. You get my vote ;-)
I think any kind of editing in a comment should try to fix up the *'s
automatically for the user.  Think of it as a paragraph editor where it's
applying a style to surround the text with /** ... */, with *'s to the left as
appropriate.

I think my original expectation was slightly off though.  The cursor should end
up on the same line as Second line (the caret moves to after the inserted Enter).

It should give:

	/**
	 * First line.
	 * 
	 * |Second line.
	 */
The result in 3.1 M2 is in fact
	/**
	 * First line.
	 * 
	 * <caret>Second line.
	 */

Not sure where the missing * in comment 2 comes from.
Confirmed.  It's working much better.
