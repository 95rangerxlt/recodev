Using 3.0M1

o Move method always generates a parameter for the source class even if it is
  never used. This happens to me a lot when I use move method (otherwise I
  probably wouldn't need to move the method).

o Move method leaves the original method in the source class. It would be nice
  to have an option to inline it automatically. After a move method, the
  original method in the source class doesn't normally add enough value to
  warrant it's existence.

I often find myself doing the following sequence:
o extract method 
o move extracted method
o change signature of method in destination class to remove unused reference to
  source class
o inline original extracted method in source class

the first 'o' is accounted for in the latest (bug 38310)
the other 'o' is a request to add 'inline original method' to the wizard

i will update the title accordingly

- Reimplementation automatically inlines method invocations to the original 
method as default
- Option to create a delegator (= leave the original method)
- Option to deprecate that delegator
