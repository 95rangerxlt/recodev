3.3 final
While tweaking some import/export in manifest I ended up with the following error "Access restriction: The type Picker is not accessible due to restriction on required project org.eclipse.equinox.prov.director". This is fine and I understand why, however the quick fix being proposed in this case is not acceptable since it propose to open the java build path property page to configure acccess rule.
Why is it unacceptable? Because we go great length with bells and whistle and communication effort to tell people not to tweak their classpath manually and the first thing we tell them in the quick fix to do otherwise....

Instead I would have expected the quick fix to tell me to add the import that I was missing.

I completely agree. Not only there should be a way for PDE/UI to override the quick fix, but all build path UI should be hidden when using a PDE project. I think PDE/UI and JDT/UI should work together to hide the build path dialog (this should be provided only in advanced mode).
If hiding is not possible, making the build path dialog readonly would be acceptable (with a message explaining why it is readonly, and a link to the MANIFEST editor).
The user can't change anything here. The access rules are defined on the PDE container entries, and the PDE container doesn't allow modifications. The quick fix just forgot to test that.

I don't think we need new concepts here.
