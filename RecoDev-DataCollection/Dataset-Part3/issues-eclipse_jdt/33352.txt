!MESSAGE File /org.eclipse.jdt.ui/src-jdt/org/eclipse/jdt/ui/JavaUI.java is
read-only.
The error dialog is no longer shown. Action enabling/disabling has been fixed. 
Initially the comment/shift/etc. actions are enabled but "fail" silently in 
the case of a read-only file whose state can not be changed by validateEdit. 
Immediatly after the first invocation all of the actions become disabled.
