I don't get 'Externalized String' hovers any more with the new NLS story.

With the org.eclipse.osgi.util.NLS based approach I have to open the
*.properties file manually again to look up a message. The hover was rather
convenient.

The new Eclipse NLS story came after the NLS tooling had been enhanced. The only
tool that supports the new NLS story in 3.1 is the Externalize Strings wizard.

Also the Hyperlinks to jump to the properties file and back to the callees are fixed
