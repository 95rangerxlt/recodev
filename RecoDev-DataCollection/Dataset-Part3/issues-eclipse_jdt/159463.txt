I guess this happens since a long time...

I have a tests workspace with some projects in it, some of them use JRE 1.4 and others JRE 1.5. I want to open a type and start to enter my pattern in text field. I get types in list until I entered "*Handle.", but when I add final '*' character then list becomes empty. If I remove the trailing '*' then list stays empty...!?

I also noticed that with "*Handle.", when list is not empty, I have
"DragHandler - javax.swing.TransferHandler" in the list...
Here are corresponding searchAllTypeNames methods parameters:
        package name: *Handle*
        match rule: R_PATTERN_MATCH
        type name: *
        match rule: R_PATTERN_MATCH
I would expect package name parameter to be "*Handle" instead as there are some trailing characters at the end of my pattern. Automatic '*' at the end of my text entered in dialog is useful, but for package name (ie. in the middle of the text), if I want a pattern char, I'll add it explicitely...
Note that to have this expected behavior I need to enter "*Handle<.*" which is not documented in the dialog message...

Inserting a '*' in the middle of my search pattern for free is very surprising. Adding a trailing one is nice though.

As a user, I am expecting to have to insert a '*' inside the name if I want some pattern matching behavior (i.e. not for free).
This comes from the feature that you can enter 'o.e.j.A' which is translated to 'o*.e*.j*' and matches org.eclipse.jdt*.A* but of course also every thing like org.eclipse.jdt.ui.

As soon as you type a dot, the part before the dot counts for the package. You don't get any results on *Handle.* because there's no packages (in the JDK) that matches *Handle.

I know this isn't optimal, but I don't think we should change this. I think the 'o.e.j' is quite powerful, comparable to camel case. But speak up if you have a better algorithm.



I agree we can debate a long time about the perfect behavior and never succeed to find one...

However, what about the other problem I described in comment 0:

Fair enough, I understand the motivation for 'o.e.j.A'.
It is some borderline usecase I think which really looked like a bug... maybe should be documented somewhere at the top of the view, where you explain possible wildcards... 
Adding & removing the '*' should not make a difference, and I couldn't reproduce what you wrote.
Adding & removing the '.' changes from matching the type name to matching the package name, this also seems to work for me.

Sorry to bother you on this point, but I can reproduce it on a brand new workpsace...
1) Using build I20061003-0800, launch eclipse with JDK 1.4.2 on a brand new wksp
2) Create a Java Project
3) Open "Open Type" dialog
4) Enter "*Handle."
   => There are 19 items in the list
5) Add '*' after "*Handle."
   => List is emptied
6) Remove the trailing '*'
   => List stays empty
7) Remove trailing '.'
   => List has now lot of items
8) Add '.', at the end
   => List has now 19 items again...

Ok I found the problem: this is a dup of bug 120534. Bug 120534 depends on bug 122519 and from what I saw, this could be fixed already: see my comment in bug 122519. So I changed our code to now match on the type container name, not just on the package name > 20061006
