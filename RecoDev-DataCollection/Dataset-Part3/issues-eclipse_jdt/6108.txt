Instead of pointing to the source code, I would like to point to the *real* HTML 
javadoc(s) to get the Java docs in the Java Editor
The Javadocs HTML may be expanded on the file system, or I may decide to ZIP 
them all

It is on our feature list but not comitted for 2.0.
Shift-F2 in 2.0.
If I press shift-F2, the HTML javadoc is opened in Mozilla.  To me (but not
necessarily others), that feature is currently entirely useless, and not what I
thought this bug was about.

I want the in-editor tool-tips to work after I have pointed out the javadoc URL.
 They don't (in 2.0.1 at least).

Christophe: You reported this bug.  Have you got what you wanted?  If so I'm
going to file another feature request for what I want.  If not, please re-open this.
