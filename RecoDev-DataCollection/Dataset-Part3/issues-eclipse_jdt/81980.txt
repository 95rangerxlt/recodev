Although the create field and create constant in my enum type suggestions for
the quick fix in the code listed below compiles and works fine.  It is not quite
what I expected for the use of enumerated types.

public class EnumQuickFixBug implements Runnable {
    private State state;
    private enum State {begin, end};
    public void run() {
        state = State.begin;
        // Try quick fixing the line below
        state = State.middle;
        state = State.end;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        EnumQuickFixBug bugs = new EnumQuickFixBug();
        bugs.run();
        System.out.println("Done");
    }
}

I expected to declaration of the enum type to change to something like:

    private enum State {begin, end, middle};

but instead it did something like this:

    private enum State {begin, end;

    public static State middle;};
