	- for fields: always public static and final
	- for methods: always public and abstract

agreed that this would be more consistent.
low prio
The main problem is that we do not handle methods and fields consistent:
- For methods we never show the 'A' overlay even if declared in the editor
- For fields we show the overlays as declared in the editor
Increasing priority since this is an inconsistency and I guess an easy fix.

we should handle fields and methods consistent
now fields in interfaces are always final.

our rule:
interfaces a& members in interfaces never have the abstract symbol
fields in interface have always the final
