The delete resource dialog that comes up when attempting to delete a project has the following option:

Delete project contents on disk (cannot be undone)

The message should have a mnemonic so that it can be used toggled using a keyboard.

This message is available in the resource plugins/org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring/src/org/eclipse/ltk/internal/ui/refactoring/RefactoringUIMessages.properties

under the property:

DeleteResourcesWizard_project_deleteContents=Delete project contents on disk (cannot be undone)

Thanks :)
Although I do not know how this was implemented, I feel that the new dialog should be consistent with the old 3.3 style.

The old dialog says:

title: Confirm Project Delete
message: Are you sure you want to delete project 'helloworld'?
option 1: &Also delete contents under '/opt/workspace/helloworld' (Project cannot be restored using "Undo")
option 2: &Do not delete contents

File a new bug if you prefer the old style to the new. I found the old one quite not so elegant, but of course it was wordier.
