If you rightclick source folders and run unit tests, a Junit run configuration 
is created for that run. The name of this configuration is: "test (%NR)"
where %nr is an incrementing number.

I suggest the following run configuration name: "junit %project-name %source-
folder-name"

so for the project myXml and folder: src/test the generated name would 
be "junit myXml src/test"

Cheers,

Ping Erich.
fixed - for containers the fully qualified name is used as the launch config name.
