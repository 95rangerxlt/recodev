HEAD

/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tips/jdt_tips.html#searching_section
has an interesting entry "Search for methods with a specific return type".

This information should also be available on the
Java Development User Guide > Reference > Search
page (/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-131.htm)

Should also check if that works for fields too.
