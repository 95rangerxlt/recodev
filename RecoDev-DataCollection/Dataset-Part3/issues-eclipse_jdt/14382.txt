Using M5 eclipse.

I'm using a black background-color for the java-editor. When using a scrapbook
the string are displayed in balck, too. This means that it isn't possible to
read them (black on black).

The code color is grey and it would be good, if strings are also displayed in
grey, as long as all these colors aren't configurable.

Scrapbook should share the Java Editor preferences. This will require 
additional API support. Darin what do you need from us to do so.
This is already implemented in the scrapbook (will be in the integration build 
today 20020423).

So we would have less reliance on internals:
Expose the JavaPlugin JavaTextTools via JavaUI
We need access to the JavaTextTools and the Java UI preference store. Will open 
a new bug for that.

Verified.
Verified that we use the Java editor preferences, but we still fail on the text 
coloring...

reopening...

When I set the Windows display scheme to "High Contrast #1", the java editor 
text is not visible. Moving to JUI.
Using the Java Editor Preference Page you can set the colors used for syntax 
highlighting including the color of "regular" code. We don't support "Default 
System Foreground Color" for text editors. Will be considered post 2.0
