<td colspan="1" valign="top" align="left">Instance Breakpoints...</td>
<td colspan="1" valign="top" align="left">Allows you to filter existing breakpoints to the selected variable instance.</td>

We are not sure what the sentence "Allows you to filter existing breakpoints to the selected variable instance." means. So I want to know that does it mean
"Allows you to filter existing breakpoints, so that only breakpoints of the selected variable instanse displayed."?

I need your points, thanks.

Reassigning to JDT.
It means that the breakpoint will only stop if the code is executed on the selected instance in the Variables view.
