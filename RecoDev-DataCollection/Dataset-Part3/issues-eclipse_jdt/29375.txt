When references to a class or method are in the static initialiser for a class
(which is also in a package other than the default one) the results contain
spurious nulls. Test case:

package foo.bar;

public class Test
{
    static
    {
        new Test().toString();
    } 
}

Highlight "Test" (either place) and search for references in the workspace. The
result will be:

nullnullbar.Test.{...}

result will be:

nullnullbar.Test.{...}
The described output happens when the results are sorted by 'Parent Name'.

If the results are sorted by 'Path Name' then the outcome is:
NestedSourceFolderExportBug/src/icons - nullnullbar.Test.{...}

The output is correct if the results are sorted by 'Name':
{...} - foo.bar.Test
