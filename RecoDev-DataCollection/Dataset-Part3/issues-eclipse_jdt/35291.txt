I've got the following code:

		for (int i = 0; i < list.getLength(); i++) {
			Node item = list.item(i);
			if (item.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
				result.add(getElementUniqueName((Element)
item));
			}
		}
		return result;

All types except "Element" are resolved.
Apply "Organize Imports", there are 3 variants (including e.g. 
javax.swing.text.Element), but no org.w3c.dom one.
On manual code assist (i.e. CTRL-SPACE after "Element"), I'm getting required 
org.w3c.dom.

There are no clashes in imports.

Eclipse 200303120800.

problem confirmed in 0318.

Not a stop ship but annoying.
investigate to understand the cause since it is reproducable. 
com.ibm.rmi.corba.Element is not visible and organize import filters non 
visible types.
Code assist does not filter but should (checkbox in editor preference 
page 'Show only proposals visible')
Martin, AFAIU you're pointing to another problem, which explains why more 
choices are available in code assist, however I'd like to attract your 
attention to the fact that in code snapshot there is already imported class 
org.w3c.dom.Node (like I said all types, except Element, are resolved) and 
org.w3c.dom.Element is definitely visible in the context.
yes, you're right. moving back to jdt.ui

I can't reproduce it in my workspace but erich has it

fix
The bug is in our all types cache.
Method getTypesForName returns not all the types with the given name if the 
workspace contains several project with the types of the same qualified type 
name. In the case of such a workspace, organize import would remove imports as 
it can't find the types
