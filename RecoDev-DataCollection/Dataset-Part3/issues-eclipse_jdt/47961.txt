The new comment formatter measures the width of characters to get properly
aligned formatting even for proportional fonts. As this is font dependent, such
an option might cause problems for shared development, if every developer uses a
different font.

We need a preference to control this behaviour.

Note that the same can be achieved by choosing a monospace (fixed-width) font.

This has been fixed during the comment formatter push down to JDT Core.
