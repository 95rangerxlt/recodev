Imagine a Floder class, with instance field "name".
The constructor will report unused "namee" but also reports that the assignement
as no effect. 

Folder(String namee)
{ this.name = name; }

We nee all these extremely usefull warnings to be in the compiler options.
I would easily put this one as an ERROR, to be sure it shows up in my filtered
task list.

In latest integration build, Compiler option got added in UI to control the 
severity of these options. Unused local variable and argument were already 
available as compiler options.

Moving to JDT/UI which owns the options surfacing anyway.
moving to Martin, the compiler option surfacer
the UI for 'assignement as no effect' was added recently. (Preferences->Java-
>Compiler)
