Now it works via menu Navigate > Show In > Package Explorer, but the associated
keybinding doesn't work in the text editor (even if scope is set to 'General').
>(even if scope is set to 'General').
Where did you do this?

>>(even if scope is set to 'General').
>Where did you do this?

- Preferences > Workspace > Keys:
- Select Navigate, Show In > Pkg Exp.
- Set Combo 'When:' to 'General'
- Set 'Key Sequence: Name:' to 'Ctrl+P'
- Press 'Add'

I just noticed:
In my workspace, the menu 'Package Explorer' only shows up in 'Java' and 'Java
Browsing' perspectives, but not in 'Debug', 'Resources', or 'CVS'. And I didn't
find a way to configure this.
Well, this is a keybinding story limitation: there's no feedback whether the
action is really supported in that scope.

what i really want is a context menu entry - like for java files
but i can live with a keyboard shortcut
Adam: In 3.0, at least there's a two-stroke keyboard shortcut for this:
  Alt+Shift+W, P
("Navigate > Show In", then P to run the only menu entry starting with P)
Resetting priority to P3. Will be reassessed for the next release.
Has been fixed a while ago (there's now a 'Show In' entry).
