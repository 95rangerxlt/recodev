I20080222-1622

Two of our correction icons have a white background (instead of transparent). This was not visible in the quick fix proposals list, since that list is always white (bug 45597), but it's visible now in the rich problems hover (the "+" to add unknown words to dictionary).

Affected icons in org.eclipse.jdt.ui/icons/full/obj16/:
add_correction.gif
correction_linked_rename.gif

All other icons in jdt.ui are OK (except for the temp icon for bug 210924).

Good catch!

Fixed add_correction.gif and correction_linked_rename.gif in HEAD and added heads-up to bug 210924.
