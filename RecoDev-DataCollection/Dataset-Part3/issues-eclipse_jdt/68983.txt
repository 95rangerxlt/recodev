It seems to be impossible to use refactoring features on a Type whose source is
not in the project/workspace.
For example, I would like to replace all instances of ArrayList by List where it
is possible (using the "Use Supertype Where Possible" refactor feature, but it
does not appear to be possible since there is no refactor menu on binary only Types.
This lessens significantly the benefits of this refactoring feature.

Tobias, can you please comment why this is disabled ?
The call to Checks#isAvailable checks for read only status, which is wrong here
