Build ID: M20080911-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Import the soon-to-be-attached 'testprocessor' plug-in project into your workspace.
2. From your workspace, run a PDE workspace.
3. Import the soon-to-be-attached 'test' project into the PDE workspace.
4. Note the 'Argument has primitive type' message in Error Log. This message should appear in Problems view instead.


More information:
BaseMessagerImpl#createProblem implementation does not provide ReferenceContext for PARAMETER elements. It also does not consider AnnotationMirror and AnnotationValue which could have been provided through Messager to enhance reporting precision.

Created attachment 120553
'testprocessor' plug-in project

'test' project
Created attachment 122525
New  'testprocessor' plug-in project

Changed 'testprocessor' output message kind from 'NOTE' to 'WARNING' because IdeMessagerImpl always directs any 'NOTE' messages to the error log and that does not illustrate the issue with PARAMETER handling very well.

Proposed patch

This patch fixes the aforementioned problem with the handling of PARAMETER elements as illustrated by the enclosed 'testprocessor'. It still does not take into account the additional AnnotationMirror/AnnotationValue arguments though. Walter, would it be better to file another bug report on the AnnotationMirror/AnnotationValue handling and make this one depend on that?
Hi Vladimir, thanks for working on this.  I'll take a closer look at the test and proposed patch this weekend.  Olivier, cc'ing you in case you're interested.
Thank you, Walter! I'll be offline this weekend, so see you on Monday!
Fixed in HEAD, using the proposed patch with some whitespace changes.  I also added a test case in o.e.jdt.compiler.apt.tests.MessagerTests.
