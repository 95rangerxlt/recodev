I guess this moves to M7.

Indeed so. Sorry, I should have updated the target milestone.
I think there will be more related updates to quick fixes than just this
one, which I plan to address in one go during M7.

proposed fix

This patch builds on the patches in bug 400668 and bug 405086.

It handles both new IProblems
+ ConflictingNullAnnotations
+ ConflictingInheritedNullAnnotations

In both positions:
+ parameter
+ return type

We propose to insert either annotation for disambiguation:
+ @NonNull
+ @Nullable

All is based on the existing implementation from bug 337977 et al.
Thanks for the patch.
