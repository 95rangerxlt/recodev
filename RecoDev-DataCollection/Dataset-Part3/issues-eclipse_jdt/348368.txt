Please add support to highlight inherited fields.

Example:

class A {
    ...
    protected int a;
    protected int x;
    ...
}

class B extends A {
    ...
    protected int b;
    void isntThatCoolIfSomeoneOverridesA() {
        a = b;
        x = b * b;
    }
    ...
}

In the example, "a" and "x" should be highlighted using a special "inherited field" style.

I'll take a look during M7.
Thanks for the patch Bj√∂rn. It works and even adds a test case!

I committed your patch with three changes:
- added copyright information
- adjusted copyright date
- ignored the change in AbstractSemanticHighlightingTest since it's not related
  to this bug
