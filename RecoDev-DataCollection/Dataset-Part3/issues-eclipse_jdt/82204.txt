I have a similar problem. If I'm looking at a java class included from a library
that has source attached (editor tab says <ClassName>.class instead of .java), I
am unable to use F3 to open a declaration. Right clicking and selecting Open
Declaration does work. If I'm editing a java source file, F3 works as expected
until I drill down into a library class when it stops again. I tried fixing this
with the keys preferences, but couldn't get it to work.
Jay this is not related to this bug report since everything works except that
the label is wrong.

In your scenario, from the main menu bar try Navigate > Open Declaration. Does
it work? Does the label include F3? Please open a separate bug and add the
answer there. Don't forget to include the build id.
Fixed in HEAD.
