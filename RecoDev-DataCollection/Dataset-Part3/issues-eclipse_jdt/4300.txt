Ctrl-Shift-T
	Select a type.
	Hit OK.
	The type is opened in the java editor, but the editor does not have focus unless I click on it.

	This has the undesired effect of leaving the Outline editor showing the contents of the
	previously selected editor until I select the new editor.

	I'm pretty sure it didn't used to work this way.

20020205: Verified:
When "Show in Type Hierarchy" is selected, focus goes to outline in type 
hierarchy.
When "Show in Type Hierarchy" is not selected, focus goes to editor.
In both cases, the outline is updated.
But the bug is that I opened a java editor and focus does not go to it. Please 
correct me if I misunderstand. If I open a file I should be able to type in it 
without any further mouse clicks to give it focus. The outline view should not 
get focus.
If "Show in Hierarchy" is checked the Type Hierarchy Part view gets the focus. 
The reason for that is Fast View support. Assume you have the Type Hierarchy 
View docked as Fast View, it would show up briefly - when getting new input - 
and then disapprear because the editor has the focus. Fast View supports 
overrules "instant typing" in this case.
