Currently if you call Properties action from popup menu (or Alt-Enter on windows) on classpath container (i.e. "JRE System Library") it says "no property pages available". So, you have to go into project properties or open Build Path / Configure Build Path... select container and hit Edit there.

Please allow to open classpath container properties from container node in the Package Explorer.

Currently, you can get the configuration page with 'Configure...'.
But I agree it would be more elegant to use the property pages for that.
Is there are way to register my own property page until this issue is resolved?
You can register property pages through the extension point org.eclipse.ui.propertyPages

The 'Configure...' command is implemented in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.ConfigureContainerAction
We should remove 'Configure' and use the properties page instead.

IMHO this is a high risk fix, but it's only M2, so we have enough time to test it...
