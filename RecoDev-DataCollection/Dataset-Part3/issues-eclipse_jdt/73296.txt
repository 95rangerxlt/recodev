When the code:

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

is generated, I would like to be able to specify the Javadoc comment separately
from other kinds of fields. Thanks.

Version 3.1.M1.

Version 3.1.M1.
Belongs to serial version quick fix.
See also bug 73295.
Martin, our opinion ?
IMO we should limit the number of configurable code templates and only contain 
some of the major constructs.
Therefore I would not introduce an extra case for the serial number.
For the user the alternative is always to create a normal template that then 
can be (manually) inserted in from of the field.

Dirk, please close if you agree, else assign it to me.
I second Martin's opion.

There shouldn't be an explosion of special case (i.e. based on existing) templates.

Quickfix now uses the standard template for new fields
