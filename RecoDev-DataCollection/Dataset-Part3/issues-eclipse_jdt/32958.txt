Build 2.1 RC1

I tried to rename a CU which was out of synch. The preview dialog correctly said:
"Cannot proceed due to the following problems:"

The problem is that the dialog also shows the warnings (which don't prevent me
from continuing) and that the actual error was at the bottom of the list i.e. I
first had to scroll down all the warnings to see what was preventing me from
doing the refactoring.

I would suggest to use the severity as first sort property.

Fixed for RC2
