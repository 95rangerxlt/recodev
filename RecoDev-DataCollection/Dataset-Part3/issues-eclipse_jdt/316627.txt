Build Identifier: M20100211-1343

The first time I try to edit a derived resource, Eclipse gives a warning about the resource being derived. However, when some refactoring would change that same resource, no warning is issued.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generate some Java classes with some tool like ANTLR
2. Mark the generated sources as derived
3. Create a normal class that refers to one of the generated classes
4. Rename the generated class by changing its name in the class that refers it
5. Eclipse will complete the refactor without any warning, but once you regenerate your ANTLR code, you will have compile errors

Fix

I would have expected a warning dialog in step 4. You already get that if the .java file itself is marked as derived, but you didn't get it when only an ancestor of the file was marked as derived.

The patch fixes this and also fixes the rendering on the refactoring preview page.
Fixed in HEAD.
