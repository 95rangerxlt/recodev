I20081027-1800.

1. enable the warning for missing hashCode()
2. paste:
class C {
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		return true;
	}
}
==> quick fix to generate hashCode() and equals() is proposed but I only get a dialog that this can't be done due to no non-static fields.

Marking as M4 as this is new 3.5 functionality.
Fixed in HEAD.
