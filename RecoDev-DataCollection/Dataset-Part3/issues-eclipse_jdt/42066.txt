The spacing at the top, left and right should be the same as the spacing between
the OK button and the bottom.

Where do you think the margin isn't ok? I can't see this in your image.

take a look at the orange and the pink lines
ok, got it. We normally don't set marginTop. Also, the spacing should be set:
==>
layout.marginHeight= 
    convertVerticalDLUsToPixels(IDialogConstants.VERTICAL_MARGIN);
layout.marginWidth= 
    convertHorizontalDLUsToPixels(IDialogConstants.HORIZONTAL_MARGIN);
layout.verticalSpacing= 
    convertVerticalDLUsToPixels(IDialogConstants.VERTICAL_SPACING);
layout.horizontalSpacing= 
    convertHorizontalDLUsToPixels(IDialogConstants.HORIZONTAL_SPACING);


In addition the EditTemplateDialog in Platform Text needs to be adjusted as well.
