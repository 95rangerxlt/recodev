The Code Formatter Profile Editor should be more fault-tolerant. Especially on
'White Space' and 'Line Wrapping' tabs, it is very easy to mess things up by
changing many settings at once with a single click at the wrong spot.

Two possible solutions came to my mind:

(1) The dialog could support an undo/redo-stack (via keybindings and/or via
additional buttons on the bottom row)

(2) The dialog could offer an 'Apply' button, with which the user could save the
changes done so far. The current workaround for this is to leave the dialog via
OK and then re-enter it, but that's cumbersome when you want to do a pass over
all options.

'Apply' is a good idea
Martin, could Erol implement the Apply button ?

If not I opt to move this request to > 3.1 since changing the formatter settings
isn't something we do every day.
