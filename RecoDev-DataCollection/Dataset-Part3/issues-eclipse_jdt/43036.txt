I have check the checkbox "insert a new line before a opening  brace".
now when i type

if something 

ad press enter I will be positioned not under if but three characters to the 
right

if something 
   here

then when I add brace I will get this

if something
   {
   }

instead of this 

if something
{
}

This worked with 3.0M2

- "insert a new line before a opening  brace" is a code formatter preference and
has nothing to do with typing.

- the problem you describe has been fixed for 3.0 M4.
