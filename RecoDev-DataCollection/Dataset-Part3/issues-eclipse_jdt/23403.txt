I'm trying to instantiate a CompilationUnitEditor inside a MulitPageEditor.

* I know that CompilationUnitEditor is marked "internal" api, so is
there another way to get the Java editor inside a MultiPageEditor (other
than filing a bug report :-)?

* If not, CompilationUnitEditor works for me (so far) except that I get
a NullPointerException when hitting Ctrl-Space and when I try to save.
The code I'm currently using to create the CompilationUnitEditor is as
follows:

void createPage0() {
try {
editor = new CompilationUnitEditor();
// editorSite and editorInput are the site and input
// that were passed to the multi-page editor.
editor.init(editorSite, editorInput);
int index = addPage(editor, getEditorInput());
setPageText(index, editor.getTitle());
} catch (PartInitException e) {
// <<snip>>
}
}

Here is the top of the error stack when I hit Ctrl-Space:

java.lang.NullPointerException
at
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor.setStatusLineErrorM
essage(CompilationUnitEditor.java:778)
at
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor$AdaptedSourceViewer
.doOperation(CompilationUnitEditor.java:218)
at
org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.ContentAssistAction$1.run(ContentAssistAction.java:84)


It fails on the same line when I hit Ctrl-s, but with a different stack.

Can anyone tell me what I'm missing?  Alternatively, can someone point
me to another example somewhere I can use to see what I'm missing?  (I'm
running 2.01 on win32.)


Thanks,

Dave

The CompilationUnitEditor works now with IEditorStatusLine. This should solve 
your NPE problem. I20021001.
