agreed unhappy in this scenario.

however, just verified and this behaviour already existed in 2.1.


Moving back to the JDT/UI inbox
no changes planed
Reopen to close as fixed: the JUnit view is now initially brought to front and the preference has been moved into the view menu.
This has been fixed.
