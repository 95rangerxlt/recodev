Build 20030326

The table of contents of the Java Development User Guide has some problems:

(1) Tips and Tricks subhead should be a leaf node and titled "Tips and 
tricks". All the subheads under it should go away.

(2) What's New in 2.1 subhead should be a non-empty leaf node titled "What's 
new". The page should not be empty.
