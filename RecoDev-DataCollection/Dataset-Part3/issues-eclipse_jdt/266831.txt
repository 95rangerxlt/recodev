Patch with the fix.
Released modified patch:
- moved the cast to IMethod to where the type check is
- a method in a static class *can* be overridden, e.g.:

public class Try {
	public static class A {
		public void method() {}
	}
	
	public static class B extends A {
		public void method() {}
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new A().method();
	}
}
