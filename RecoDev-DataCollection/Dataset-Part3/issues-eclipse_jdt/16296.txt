to make it consistent with the rest of the copy actions
FYI, this other PR is related:
http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13048
bug 6178 has been fixed for compilation units, non-java resources and packages
projects are done by the platform

so sourcefolders are the only thing left
the navigator will have to be fixed too if the platfrom wants to provide the 
same function.
please see also platfrom bug 13869
how much effort is it to add the "prompt for new name on paste" for source 
folders?
not straightforward given that we update the classpath as well
if there are no strong agruments for it, i'd like to defer it for after 2.0
it's a very unfrequently performed operation and you can always use 'rename' 
now.
defer/readme
we don't do the classpath dance ourselves anymore
