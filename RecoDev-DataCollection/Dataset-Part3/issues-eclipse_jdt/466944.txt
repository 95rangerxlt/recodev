JDT core's test framework needs changes to be able to run with JDK 9. The test frame work makes some assumptions about the JDK resources and quite a few tests are failing with JDK 9. The tests should be fixed to work with JDK 9 and below.

Is this JDT Core specific or are others (e.g. JDT UI or PDE) having the same issue?

I meant this bug particularly for JDT Core. But there is a possibility that other components will have similar needs. We will know once we have an SDK build with tests.
With the latest commit in the branch, all existing JDT Core tests are green when run with JRE 9 (b62):

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA9&id=231e9dd1940dec95efe6fd4c51999bba5c952e39

I had to put in some interim kludge to keep up the package-module mapping, which is not yet provided in the JDK. Currently things are kind of messy because the same package can be present in multiple modules and we need to handle this. At the same time it is not good for performance if we want to keep mapping between classes and modules. 

I haven't yet introduce the new compliance level, as it doesn't yet makes sense. Also note that the following tests are not run with JRE9 because they use/test features unsupported in JRE 9, such as endorsed, ext etc.:

NullTypeAnnotationTest#test443467()
LambdaExpressionsTest#test436542()
BatchCompilerTest#testBug419351()

I'm guessing we should soon ask the webmasters to install an early adopter JRE 9, on at least one of our test machines. Is now the time?

Yep, it will be good to be able to run tests with JRE 9.

I've opened bug 469515 to get the webmaster's help. Please comment there if you want a specific version. I picked "Linux" to start off with since a. we have more of those machines, and b) generally they run faster than Windows or the Mac. 

I'll have to change some stuff in our "test framework" ... so won't commit to time frame at the moment, but should be "in a week or two".
As far coding is concerned, this is done.
