Have eclipse style NLSed accesor class with:
	public static String T_0;
	public static String T_1;

Have properties file with:
	T_0=eclipse style

No reference to either T_0 or T_1.

Find Broken NLS Keys correctly reports unused key (T_0) in properties file but only reports key T_1 as unused in the accessor class. It should report T_0 as well.

It does report T_1 as undefined, not as unused. Fix for bug 133486 should make this clear. T_0 is defined, that's why there is no report for T_0 in the accessor class. Question is if it is enough to report T_0 as unused only in the propertie file or if we should report it as unused in the propertie file and in the accessor class (Then there would be two results for T_1 in the accessor class: unused and undefined.)

Yes please.
