If you use JavaUI.createTypeDialog to create a type selection dialog and pass 
in a filter string, the MultiTypeSelectionDialog ignores this filter. The 
problem is in the open(), it does a:
  		setFilter("A"); //$NON-NLS-1$
And this overrides any current setting.

It needs to first check if the filter has not already been set, and if not, 
then set "A".

Thanks.
