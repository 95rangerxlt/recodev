and declare it as a nested source folder. UI would let me do it arguing there 
is no source folder available.

removed the filter of existing source folders for M4
The dialog needs still lots of improvement; the scenario you are trying to do 
is still not possible as the parent needs a exclusion filter added. And this

Question: should this be done automatically? Should it even be implictly done 
by the model?
