Steps To Reproduce:
let 
    Character[][] world...
be a declared field. Select it in the generation dialog as included field in hashCode and equals. It generates 
- hashCode:
    result = prime * result + Arrays.hashCode(world);
- equals:
    if (!Arrays.equals(world, other.world))
       return false;

These implementations of Arrays.hashCode / Arrays.equals do not work for multidim arrays.

Solution:
- hashCode:
    for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
            result = prime * result + world[x][y].hashCode();
            }
        }

- equals
    for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
            if (!world[x][y].equals(other.world[x][y]))
                return false;
        }
    }

Patch

Using Arrays.deepHashCode for multidimensional arrays in projects >= 1.5.
Markus, please have a look.
Looks good. It's not nice that we still fail for source level < 1.5, but bug 304176 has the same problem. We can fix that later if it turns out to be a real issue for somebody.
