When launching a vanilla JUnit test (not PDE test) on a project that contains
classes in org.eclipse.jdt.junit.*, the tested project is placed in the
classpath of the launched JVM _after_ the jdt.junit.* plug-ins found in the
platform.  This is inconsistent with other behavior: when Eclipse is being run
in the Run-time workbench, or when running a PDE test, the tested project is
placed first.

Proposed fix

Makes the classpath for vanilla JUnit consistent with PDE JUnit and JUnit run
from  a runtime workbench instance.
Markus,

Erich and I have discussed this one already.
Yes, makes sense. Released patch to HEAD.
