In addition to the existing SWT templates, here's another template that contributes a GridData template.

${gridData:newType(org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData)} ${layoutData:newName(org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData)} = new ${gridData}(SWT.${horizontal:link(FILL, BEGINNING, CENTER, END)}, SWT.${vertical:link(FILL, TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM)}, ${hex:link(true, false)}, ${vex:link(false, true)});
${parent:var(org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control)}.setLayoutData(${layoutData});

Benno, you're the SWT template man. You decide whether to add this.

Obviously there are more templates around layouts. I'd be happy to contribute them :)
Are we not promoting use of the org.eclipse.jface.layout.GridDataFactory for some reason?

We have an 'SWT' template context which is especially for SWT templates. Not JFace. Of course a 'JFace' context could also be added with templates for viewers etc.
Makes sense, we have a GridLayout template already.
