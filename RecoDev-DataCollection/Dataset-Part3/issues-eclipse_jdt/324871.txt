I found this while fixing bug 324857. 

Steps
- Expand Navigate menu
- Hover over 'Open from Clipboard'
- Press F1 => help opens (see the attached screenshot)

Problem in the screenshot
- 'About Java Editor' and 'Search for Java Editor' lines are incorrect, they should be 'About Open from Clipboard' and 'Search for Open from Clipboard'

'Open from Clipboard' is added as a menuContribution (the helpContextId is picked up correctly and the correct description and links are shown in help, these are marked in the attached screenshot as well)
 <extension 
         point="org.eclipse.ui.menus">
       <menuContribution
            locationURI="menu:navigate?endof=open.ext">
        <command
              commandId="org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.command.OpenFromClipboard"
              helpContextId="org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.open_from_clipboard_action_context"
              label="%OpenFromClipboardAction.label"
              tooltip="%OpenFromClipboardAction.tooltip"
              style="push">
        </command>
       </menuContribution>
   </extension>

Note: To reproduce this bug, you might have to apply the patch from bug 324857 as it is not in a build at this time.

Suggested patch to jdt.doc.user

This patch adds a title attribute to this context. If there is no title attribute the title will be derived from whichever view/editor had focus at the time the menu was selected.
Reassigning back to JDT to review the patch
oops.. mea culpa. Thanks for the patch Chris!

Fixed in HEAD.
