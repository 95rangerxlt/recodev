if you have several fields

MyClass c = null;
YourClass b = null;
Properties properties = null;

And you select 'properties' in your text view, right click it and go 
to 'source'>'Generate delegate methods' then the MyClass type will be shown at 
the top, completely opened so that all its methods will be shown.

the Properties type is checked correctly though.  Would it be difficult, to 
bring 'Properties' to the top of the dialog?  I.e. so that I don't have to 
scroll past all the methods of MyClass and YourClass (or without me having to 
collapse both classes first) in order to reach the methods from Properties?

Not critical for 3.0, but a usablility feature we should consider post 3.0.
