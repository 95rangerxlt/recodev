Build 20020423

There is a possible concurrency hole (that could explain some of the indexer 
crashes) when saving the index before querying it.

The problem is that the following pattern is used:
monitor.enterWrite();
index.save();
monitor.exitWrite();
monitor.enterRead();
index.queryInDocumentNames(...);
monitor.exitRead();

Between exitWrite() and enterRead(), a writer is able to write to the index.

Fixed by adding ReadWriteMonitor.exitWriteEnterRead().
Also removed the save() in all the index query methods. This is done by the 
client.
