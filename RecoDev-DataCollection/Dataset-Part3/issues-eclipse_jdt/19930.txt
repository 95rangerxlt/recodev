Build F2

90% of the time, when I extract a local variable, the variable name could be 
easily inferred from selected code.

If the last message send in selected code is of the form 'getXXX', the 
variable name should probably be XXX.

e.g. I just extracted a local variable from the following code:
  getEditorPart().getToolTipHandler()
not surprisingly, I named the variable toolTipHandler.

It would be nice if the action figured this out for itself and seeded the 
variable name text field with this guess.

i like this idea
will have a look after the 2.0 swirl is over
re-o
fixed - guesses names if last message send's name starts with 
'get' or 'is' and if the next char is upper case
so:
getFred() -> fred
isSmall() -> small
