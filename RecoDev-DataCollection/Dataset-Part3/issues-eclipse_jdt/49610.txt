With the fabulous new code formatter, it is possible to define settings for 
spacing around parenthesis on method calls etc.

Curly brace formatting settings are automatically applied when typing such 
that the braces are placed using the code formatter settings, but this is not 
done with parentheses.

For example, if I have parameter completion turned on, if I type in:

if(

Then a popup list of parameters deemed appropriate by Eclipse is presented. 
However this list appears immediately as I type the open parenthesis.

When I code, I prefer to put a space after my open parenthesis so that I would 
end up with code that looks like (for example):

if( parameter == true )

As, when I type this, I type "if( " (eg I type the space), then the parameter 
completion sticks the item from the top of its list into my "if(" statement 
right next to the open parenthesis.

What I would like is, if I have configured for parameter completion to be 
turned on, and have also configured for a space to be added after the open 
parenthesis, that Eclipse adds the space before popping up the parameter list 
and inserts my selection. 

In this way, if I type "if(", Eclipse adds a space, pops the parameter list, 
and then adds the selected parameter *after* the space to achieve the code 
formatting I have selected.

Please please please!!

Otherwise I cannot use the auto parameter completion

Additionally, as I have also configured for a space before the closing 
parenthesis so that I get:

if( condition )

then it would be nice if Eclipse inserted that final space before the closing 
bracket in the cases when it automatically completes that code section for me

Are there any plans to make the code completion sensitive to the formatting
settings? This issue seems to pop up now and then without beeing taken care of.

Code completion of methods now also respects the formatter settings and will add
correct spaces wherever they are needed and sets up the linked proposals
accordingly.

Note that we never had code completion on conditionals as reported in comment 0.
However, templates inserted (e.g. the 'if' template) respect the formatter settings.
