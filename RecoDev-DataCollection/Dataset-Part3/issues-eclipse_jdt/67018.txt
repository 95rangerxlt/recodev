tabs of the Java>Editor preference page end up with clipped labels. I will
attahc screenshots.

I'm upping the severity since the labels are unreadable and resizing the dialog
doesn't help.
Not a regression for Appearance page, Folding page is new.

On WinXP the labels render correctly - do you only see this on those pages or is
this a general problem on all pages?

Worse than the clipped labels is the fact that the list is no longer visible
when the font gets very large.

It is only on those two pages on GTK.
*** Bug 68861 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Adapting summary since not only labels but also content is affected (see dup PR).

We are in the process of updating the accessibility information for 3.1.  Is 
this bug going to be fixed in 3.1 or has it been fixed as part of the 
preference pages redesign?

This is currently fixed but we're not yet sure whether we stick to the
collapsible sections UI (see bug 89921).

If we revert to the old format then we will ensure this bug remains fixed. For
the Appearance section this is no longer a problem since it's much smaller. We
would have to keep an eye on the Folding section.
There are still some cut off pages in High Contrast on an 1152x768 display in
RC1 on Windows XP

Java->Editor
   Code Assist
   Hovers (Description is one line)
   Templates
   Typing

To set up High Contrast select the High Contrast settings in Control Panel ->
Accessibility Options -> Display after you have set your resolution of 1152x768
I'd prefer new and more specific bugs.

I will file separate bugs.
