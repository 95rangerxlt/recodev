Currently the user has to select the method name. Would be better if the 
refactoring will work if the cursor is inside the method's signature.

- when caret/selection on method name (call or declaration) -> that method
- otherwise: caret position's enclosing method declaration
  - when caret inside argument list of method declaration
      -> enclosing method declaration
  - when caret inside argument list of method call
      -> enclosing method declaration (and NOT method call)
