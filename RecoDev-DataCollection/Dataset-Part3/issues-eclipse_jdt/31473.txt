To compute the list of shared working copies we call 
JavaCore.getSharedWorkingCopies(getBufferFactory());

Would be nice to have a flag that specifies if the result should only include 
working copies that are on the build path.

Moving to JDT/Core for comments about adding this functionality. Please move 
back to JDT/UI so that we can finally fix the problem.
Can't you filter them after the fact using the isOnClasspath API ?
(how many of these do you expect ?)
Yes, we know. That's why I said "would be nice".

However I aksed since I think that the common case is to only consider CUs on 
the class path. For this case the code would be located at one place.
#getSharedWorkingCopies isn't actually creating new working copies.
So the post filtering should be the only thing to consider.

Back to JDT/UI.
Fixed for build > I20030214.
Dirk,
did you fully fix this PR or only bug 30706? In other words: is the fix also in
place for Java Search?

I fixed all occurrences of JavaUI.getSharedWorkingCopies()
