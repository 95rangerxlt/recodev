I20100316-0859

- In JavaModelManager.getReferencedClasspathEntries(IClasspathEntry, IJavaProject) (Rev. 1.445), select "project.getProject()"
- Refactoring > Extract Local Variable....
- Preview >
=> Error page with 4 invalid problems "Entry cannot be resolved to a type"

Can also be reproduced in I20100316-0859 by taking the example from bug 306568, executing Organize Imports (which fixes the imports), and then extracting "hello" into a local variable.

Could be caused by bug 306568. Will check back once that one is fixed.
