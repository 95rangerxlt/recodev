There should be a toggle button or checkbox preferences item allowing to hide
(or keeping collapsed) the import declaration branch in the class outline view.

When outline view and editor are linked the import declarations section in
outline view expands unintentionally when walking through the imports in editor.
Showing imports in outline view has IMHO no added value in comparison to raw
source code, but waste much space there.

This got implemented for M8 (the outline supports filters).
