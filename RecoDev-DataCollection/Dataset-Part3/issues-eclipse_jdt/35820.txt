class F{
  void f(){
   F[] fs= <caret here>
  }
}

type '{'
'}' gets added
type 'this'
type '}'
you're left with
class F{
  void f(){
   F[] fs= {this}
   }
  }
}

which is nasty

the algorithm could figure out that i'm inserting the closing } and thus 
invalidating the } that was put by the algorithm
