suggest no action for 2.0
Reopening for 2.1 consideration
Confusing, yes.

Editor:
   "Insert space for tabs (see code formatter preference page)"
Formatter:
   "Insert tabs for indentation, not tabs"

(1) In the one you check the box for tabs, in the other you do exactly the 
opposite - check the box for spaces.  (Presumably done by different teams).

(2) The editor one seems to take preference over the formatter one.  Poor souls 
only aware of the formatter one, have the mistaken but understandable 
impression that the feature just does not work.

(3) Although the editor one warns you of the existence of the formatter one, 
the reverse is not true.

(M5, w2k).

An additional comment from bug 26270 that I made and is not in here:

In later versions of Eclipse, it would make sense to have a generic editor preferences configuration box 
in Eclipse, and then (if necessary) have as sub Java/XML/Whatever child from that, rather than a specific 
Java/Editor; in other words, use:

+ Editor <- tab/space configuration, general fonts (comments, string literals etc)
 - Java <- preferences with Java editors (formatting, close brace etc.)
 - XML <- location of DTDs etc

instead of
+ Java
 - Editor
+ XML
 - Editor
An additional comment from bug 26270: this bug should also consider the 'show x spaces for tab', 
which is currently also shown in two places.

This has been resolved for M4.

The current approach is to take the settings from the formatter. In order to
make this obvious, a link to the formatter preferences has been added on the
editor page.

One new confusing thing is that the Java editor does not respect the newly
shared text editor preference for tab width. But there is no way around this.

That doesn't sound right - how hard can it be for the Java Editor to retrieve
the values from the shared text editor preferences??
re comment 14: 

not hard at all for the editor - but the formatter also works headlessly, ie.
without an editor being displayed. Hence, it cannot use the editor display
preferences. In order to make the Java editor consistent, we chose to go down
this way...
