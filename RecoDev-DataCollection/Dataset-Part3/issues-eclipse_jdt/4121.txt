	if you export a directory (project) and place the exported jar in the same directory (project) then 
	you will get an out of sync message when you overwrite the exported jar-file the 2nd time. 
	-> maybe the exported jar file should not include itself ?

The Jar exported should warn the user about the fact that he is putting the jar 
file into the source structure.
Warning is not sufficient. We also need:
1) If a JAR file is created inside the workspace it has to be add/refreshed
   ==> it will be visible after JAR creation
2) JAR x must not contain itself best way would be to warn at the end

fixed
