The 'Step Into Selection' command has a bad default keybinding on the Mac. "M1+F5" translates to "Command+F5", which is an OS-reserved shortcut that starts Voice Over.

Suggest to turn this into "CTRL+F5".

Fix
Applied/Fixed. Please verify, Markus.
Sorry, I should have tested this before supplying a patch. Ctrl+F5 is also not available.

Tested fix

Ctrl+F5 moves focus to the toolbar (does not work in Eclipse, but the keybinding is still not available). Alt+F5 is free.
Applied. Thx.
