I've noticed this on the I20040318 build, but might have been partially true 
before.

If I try to create a new working set (or edit an existing one) not all projects 
show up to add to the working set. The one's I've noticed (tested) missing are 
'simple' projects and 'feature' projects (as created with PDE). 

Is the "working set type" supposed to be that restrictive? If I select all the 
types, then they still don't show up, so no way I can add these 'simple' 
projects to any type of working set. This ie pretty important for the way we us 
projects and working sets. 

The work around for the above is to define/pretend the projects are java 
projects, even though they have no code in them. 

(Plus, I noticed while researching this, it seems once a working set is defined, 
there's no way to change it's type ... can't say there's a great need 
for it, but seem kind of inconsistent). 

BTW, I noticed this while using the filter in the package navigator while in 
Java perspective, which is why I picked JDT/UI .. not sure of source of problem.

That the Java working set doesn't allow adding non Java resources has 
historical reasons. The package explorer didn't show non Java resources in the 
past.

You can always define a resource working set and select it in the package 
explorer.

Daniel, can you please investigate if we can fix this for 3.0
The only constraint to fix this is time.
