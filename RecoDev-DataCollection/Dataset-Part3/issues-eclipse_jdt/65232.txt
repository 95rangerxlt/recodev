Syndrome: The JUnit view does not change its banner fonts used for 'Runs',
'Errors' and 'Failures' on the fly when one changes the Banner/Header fonts in
the preferences window. If I close the view, and reopen, the changes are getting
reflected ofc.

Steps to reproduce:
1. open junit view
2. open preferences, change banner/header font

Expected: the view should update its fonts on the fly listening to the
preference changes

Environment: eclipse 3.0M9, linux gtk2
