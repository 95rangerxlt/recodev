3.3

JDT has added support for access rules to be defined on execution environments. The access rules are based on OSGi profiles for each environment and users should not be allowed to edit the rules. However, we'd still like users to be able to see the rules.

Currently, the build path edit page filters access rules from the UI for JRE containers. We'd like to be able to display the rules (selectively, for certain JRE container paths - i.e. just execution environments) in read-only mode.

The associated launching feature is bug 163444.

I hardcoded the behaviour the JRE container wants for M4 (access rules shown but read-only). For M5 we would like to introduce new APi where container providers can control which attributes are shown and which are configurable.
I filed bug 168077 to extend the ClasspathContainerInitializer to provide the information the UI needs.
This got fixed for M7
