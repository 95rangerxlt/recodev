Many thanks for the great new code formatter in M6.  But I'm only missing one
minor option, which should be very easy to implement: in methods and constructors,
support "Insert white space / before opening parenthesis".  Right now, the code
formatter will always do:

int foo(int a) {}

I want this (please, please):

int foo (int a) {}

This whitespace is very important because it allows making procedure definition
syntax disambiguous from calling syntax ("i.e., foo(77)", without spaces before
the opening parenthesis).  This disambiguation is important for people who still
like to scan their sources with standard text-oriented tools, like grep:
matching "foo(" would return all calls, "foo (" would give all declarations.

The oddest thing is that the formatter actually offers an option to insert a
whitespace before opening parenthesis in method/consructor calls: "foo (77)",
but *this* is ugly and wrong beyond argument ;-)

The option is ready in the code formatter. It seems that it has not been exposed
in the UI. I checked and it works fine. By default, it is false, so no space is
added.
Silvio, could you please check that this option is visible in the UI:
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_METHOD_OPEN_BRACE?

Thanks.

Move to JDT/UI.
This option is there, see 'White Space -> Declarations -> Member Functions'. But
this inserts a space before the brace '{', not before the paren '('. So it seems
we're indeed missing the option. 

Is is possible to add it? 

FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_METHOD_OPEN_PAREN
                                          ^^^^^

Ok, I will add it. I think I was not awake on Friday :-).
This is the right option name:
FORMATTER_INSERT_SPACE_BEFORE_METHOD_DECLARATION_OPEN_PAREN

It is there.
Is this one visible in the UI?
You're right! I forgot to add this one... :-|

The option will be called 'before opening parenthesis' and be added to 'White
Space -> Declarations -> Member functions'.

Thanks for the report.
