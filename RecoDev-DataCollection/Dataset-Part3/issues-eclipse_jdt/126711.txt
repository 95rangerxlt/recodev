Thta was done on purpose, try to group together similar problems. Both indicate that you use code in a old way and should revisit to update.
Type safety issues have nothing to do with deprecations. We should rather come up with a better category name then. But I would rather opt to have a new category for 5.0 generics-related problems. Running infer type arguments on an average project produces tons of those...
