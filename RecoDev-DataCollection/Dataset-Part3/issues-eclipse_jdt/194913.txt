Using Eclipse Version: 3.3.0

If you have something like the following snippet in your editor, and run the "Create field 'foo'" quick fix, it should create an array field.

public class Test {

  public void foo(int i) {
    foo[i] = "bar";
  }
}

But instead, it creates the following:

public class Test {

  private String foo;

  public void foo(int i) {
    foo[i] = "bar";
  }
}
