We need a new severity level in the UI so that users can start using the feature.

New Gerrit change created: https://git.eclipse.org/r/57147
Pushed a first stab to Gerrit. This is NOT complete and needs updates.

Issues/TODOs:

NLS

Add the INFO severity in the same way in JavaBuildConfigurationBlock and JavadocProblemsConfigurationBlock

By default, Info annotations are not underlined in the editor, and the default color on the Annotations preference page is yellow. I'd expect blue squiggles by default.

Next/Previous Annotation commands should also jump to Infos by default.

Search for references to JavaCore.WARNING and JavaCore.ERROR and add support for INFO.

Search for references to org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.IProblem.isError()/isWarning() and add support for isInfo() (currently missing, see bug 478780)

We probably need an new icon for quick-fixable Infos.

After the above is done, verify that
- icons look right in the ruler
- Quick Fix hover appears for Infos
- Ctrl+1 shows Quick Fixes and jumps to problem on same line
- click on "i" in the left ruler opens Quick Fix proposals

Pending: to be updated after bug 478780 is resolved.

Created bug 479244.

Blue squiggles are also used by breakpoints. Hence, used a variant of Blue.

Markers view still doesn't show the new icon (shows only the bulb icon). I'll check this.

Noopur, I think this can be closed. We have an open bug for the icon.

Yes, closing as fixed.
Fixed SuppressWarningsSubProcessor#hasSuppressWarningsProposal(..), which didn't turn on the quickfix_info_obj.png for quick-fixable infos.

Example ("Malformed Javadoc comments" set to "Info" and sub-options set to "Private" and "Validate all standard tags"):

/**
 * @param exceptions
 * @return
 */
private static List<Exception> filterSubtypeExceptions(Exception[] exceptions) {
	return Arrays.asList(exceptions);
}

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=e095667dfb3f41cc51e57c21543b4c8816b87254
