It be nice to use the Emacs bindings (ctrl-p, ctrl-n) to move up and down in the
code completion window.

Currently these bindings make the cursor move around in the editor while the
code completion window is open (which may be considered a bug in itself).

Quick hack patch for 3.1.2

usage: It contains one class file (and sources). Overwrite corresponded one in original org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor_3.1.2.jar.
I locally applyed a V2 patch (found at http://www.eclipsewiki.net/eclipse/?%A5%B3%A1%BC%A5%C9%A5%A2%A5%B7%A5%B9%A5%C8%A4%CE%A5%AD%A1%BC%A5%D0%A5%A4%A5%F3%A5%C9 ) to V3.1.2, and attached here. It might only be a quick hack, but it works well for me (V3.1.2, w2k, JDK1.4.2). Please never raise objections to original patch author, even if something go wrong.
Please provide the patch as "real" patch i.e. use Team > Create Patch...

"Real" patch of quick hack
Thanks Kasai for the patch but unfortunately it is not the fix for this problem since it fakes/translates commands into key presses which the CompletionProposalPopup recognizes. The correct fix has to be on the CompletionProposalPopup  side and also include other handled keys like left/right. In addition this patch can cause side effects for clients listening for Verify or VerifyKey events.
Ive fixed this recently.
