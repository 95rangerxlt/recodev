Allow multiple selection and moves
I think you can rely on the order of element inside a IStructuredSelection. So up/down wouldn't works when the order is not to-down. I think getSelectionIndices has to be used.
If you want to implement is 100% correct, Up/Down should be allowed as long as at least one element can be moved up/down

Secondly, please avoid too much code in listeners. Better move this to a separate method.


We don't need this for 3.3...
