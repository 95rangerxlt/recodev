The new "online" Javadoc formater is great, but it should be more intelligent.

For example:

If next line starts with "<p>" the formater shouldn't unwrap it istead it 
should keep the line as a new line. The same should be applied for the "<pre>" 
tag and the content between the "<pre>" tags should be completely ignored and 
not formated.

Also statements between "<code>" tags shouldn't be wrapped or divided. 
(example: "<code>org.eclipse.somwhat</code>" becomes "<code>org. eclips. 
somewhat</code>"

It seems that the formater isn't working at all in M5.
Seems to be fixed in 3.0?, doesn't it?
Yes. BTW: you can configure how <pre> is handled.
