problem:
select a file
ctrl+c
ctrl+v (without changing selection)

nothing happens beacuse nobody told the paste action that stuff is available  
in the clipboard (there're no callback here)

see the plaftorm CopyAction on how to solve it (should be not difficult)
marking as major - does not allow you to do the usual thing of hitting 
ctlr+c/ctlr+c in a row
