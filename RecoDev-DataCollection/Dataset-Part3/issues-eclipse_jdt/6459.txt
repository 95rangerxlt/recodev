would it be possible to avoid showing the working set dialog 
on applying a working set?
i mean, it could (in the menu) show me a list of set i have. just like search 
does (which is a very useful feature)

Is on the plan
It's actually *not* on the plan. Plan is to have a filter dialog which allows to
select the working set - just as search (dialog) does.
I'll discuss again with EG if we add the last recent ones to the menu.

Talked with EG. First we'll add it to the filter dialog similar to search dialog
but using a drop down list with last recently used working sets.

Changing prio to P3

Since I use a working set filter group it is easy to implement this one.
