Another bracket matching glitch, in build 20011025

In an empty java editor, type an open round bracket immediately followed by 
close round bracket:

()


Then, place the cursor inside the brackets and type a keyword, such as null:

(null)

At this point, the last "l" of null will not be coloured correctly.  It looks 
like the bracket highlighting is causing the character to the left of the cursor 
to be forced to the default font.

The problem no longer exists in the current highlighting scheme (emphasise 
bounding box), that doesn't change character styles.

Fixed in build > 20011025
