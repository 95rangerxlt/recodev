Build ID: M20070212-1330

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Click on Run -> Run...
2. Choose a JUnit launch configuration
3. Go to the classpath tab
4. Click Advanced...
5. Pick Add Library
6. Select JUnit and click Next
7. Choose JUnit 4 and observe that the Current location displayed does not change while toggling the version.

If you click on finish you will notice that the JUnit 3.8.1 jar was added to the classpath, not the JUnit 4 one.

More information:
I can work around the problem by referencing the JUnit 4 jar via a JUNIT_HOME variable that points to C:/Program Files/eclipse/plugins/org.junit4_4.1.0.1 in my case, but I would appreciate not jumping through hoops just to pick a library.

I've verified that this happens on eclipse running on both Windows and Linux.

Looks like a bug on the launch configuration dialog.


JUnit owns the wizard page used for this: JUnitContainerWizardPage.

kicking over to JUnit for comment
You're right the bug was in the JUnitContainerWizardPage, sorry.
