The parameter name timeout preference is currently under content assist which is wrong (see 120545). We have to move it to 'Java'.

We will not change this for M4. Our hope is that the default is good enough so that we can go along without a preference.
!!!
If we decide to keep and move this preference we also have to add some key words.
Will be done together with bug 110147.
Left the preference on this page as it was renamed to 'Advanced' content assist preferences. Added keywords as suggested by comment 2. Fixed > 20060405
