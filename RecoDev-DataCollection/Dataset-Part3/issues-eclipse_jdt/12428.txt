Run Pull up on TestCase.setUp (copies the method to Assert)

Go to 2nd page of wizard. In tree of changes, under Assert, we get the 
message "copy method 'void setUp()' to type 'TestCase'". Shouldn't it be 'Copy 
method 'void setUp()' FROM type 'TestCase'" (also with upper-case C in Copy).

Another thing: if I select to delete setUp from TestCase, I get under TestCase 
the message "Delete method 'void setUp()' declared in 
type 'junit.framework.TestCase'". Here TestCase is shown with the fully 
qualified name. Shouldn't then the 'copy method' text be consistent and also 
use the fully qualified name?
