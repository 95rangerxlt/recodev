This doesn't happen all the time and no log is generated.

1)make sure the preference for marking non NLSed strings as warnings is set.
2)create a string somewhere in the code.
3)select the code assist light bulb and choose 'mark as non-externalisable'
4)save

Notice that neither the code assist light bulb in the left hand vertical bar 
nor the warning marking in the right hand vertical bar have disapear. The 
warning squillies have.

5) click on the light bulb again.

Notice the message now says 'no corrections available'.

I'm still looking for an exact way to reproduce this case as it seems to 
happen in some editors and not others.

This appears to work in the new build so I'll mark it as fixed.
