select the line.  Pressing Tab or Shift+Tab will erase the line instead of

Shift+Tab only shifts to the right/left if either a whole line (including 
whitespace at the line beginning) is selected or the selection contains at 
least on line delimiter.
Current behavior is not consistent.  Highlight line (excluding leading indent).
 Shift+Tab unindents, but Tab replaces text with a tab (unless you unindent all
the way, then it indents since it picks up all the leading whitespace!).

My vote would be for Shift+Tab to stay as is, and Tab to indent.  Regardless of
my preference, it should be consistent.

-1 from my side. Tab should insert a tab when partial text is selected

In that case, to be consistent, we should not shift-left a partial selection.
