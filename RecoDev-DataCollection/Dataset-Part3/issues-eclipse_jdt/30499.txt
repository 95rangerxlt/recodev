Build 20030122

When selecting a classfile which is inside an output folder, I get a dialog 
reading "The classfile is not on the classpath".

I think it should instead not use a Java editor, and forward the opening to 
another editor (I could imagine one rendering generated classfiles).

At worse, it would use the default text editor. Not opening a file on user 
request feels a limitation.

This has been fixed a while ago.
Works for me using I20060315-1200
