I found a couple places where links in the documentation point to file URLs to 
absolute paths on a developer's machine.  For example, under Tips and Tips, 
both Search and Java Editor contain...

file:///C:/oti/eclipse/workspace/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/images/ngrelc.gif

See the attached JPG for more details.  I have not done an extensive search for 
other offending links, so this still probably needs to be done before closing 
this PR.

Martin, please fix and do a search for text "file://" in the user and isv doc 
to make sure we don't use absolute pathes to the file system.
