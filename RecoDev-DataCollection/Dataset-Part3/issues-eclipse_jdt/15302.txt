i have many - like 30 configs defined (for my test classes).
but only 3 set as favorites.
and only a few in 'recent'

now, i want to launch a class that i do have a config defined for but it 
is not in the favorite or recent lists.

and i see no easy way to do it.

a. pressing 'run' does not work - it lauches something different

b. 'edit configs' is suboptimal - i have to find the correct config in the list 
that the dialog presents me with. and only then can i launch.
(what's more, using something called 'edit configurations' when i really want 
to launch feels strange)

c. 'new config' is clearly not what i need - i already have a config for 
launching my class

There are new actions (in HEAD) - Run/Debug Java Application, on the debug menu 
(short cuts CTRL-SHIFT-R/D). It will run or create a config for the selected 
main type.
these classes do not have main methods - they are junit test cases
should we ping EG to have a look as well so that it works in pde.junit too?
Yes - each config type should contribute its own convenience actions. Please re-
open/re-assign bug.
reopening
pls try again in 20020528
see Run>Run As>JUnit Test  etc.
