	The documentation and the example source code states that
		JavaCore.create(myProject)
	would return null if the project is not yet configured as a Java project.

	This is not the case. All 'create' routines return you handles, that do not have to
	be created nor in java projects or on any class path. The Java nature could only be
	attached to a created project. 
	
	I can see that the Javadoc on create is very fuzzy about when null can be returned, and
	I don't know what is current idea of the design.

		private void createJavaElementsFrom(IProject myProject, 
  			  IFolder myFolder, IFile myFile) {

   			  IJavaProject myJavaProject = JavaCore.create(myProject);
				// the project is not configured for Java (has no Java nature)  <<
       				 return;

moving to CORE for comment
Usually handles can be created even if they do not exist, along the same line, 
I would vote for this project handle to be created but not existing (if asked).


Updated spec for JavaCore.create(IProject) to state that the handle is always 
return and that no check is done on the existence or the java nature of the 
project.
