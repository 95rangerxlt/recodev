Sorry, commented on the wrong one ;-(

The requested feature "Add Unimplemented Methods" would be nice though ;-)
in bulid 20011812
The method's now called "Override Methods".
But, in the tree where methods can be selected to be overridden, it also shows

we have discussed the override of finals before. 
did we reject showing a warning to the user in this case?

removed the finals
