sorry, I don't speak English well.

My Team is developing web project with Eclipse in Korea.
We use TestCase for logic or repository layer's object, event if that dont't use
presentation layer's ob.

Anyway, My programming process is
 1. Create tests at TestCase for repository or logic layer's object
 2. I see success above tests by programming to product code
 3. I run AllTest for regression tests 
   (currently, about 500~600 tests)  
 4-1. if 3's success, I commit to repository(cvs).
 4-2. if 3's fail, I fix by 3's AllTests result

 5. repeat 1-4 by another task.


My programming process at 4-2. 

After AllTest run, I write fail tests at each other TestCase on paper or index
card. but, sometimes I miss to write fail one or two tests on index card.

so, I wish JUnit view have history function like console view's func.
