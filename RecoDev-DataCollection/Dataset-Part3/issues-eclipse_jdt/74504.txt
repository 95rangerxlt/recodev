Using build I200409212000.

Although "Close brackets and parenthesis" option is not checked, when I type
"if(" in Java editor, it add automatically the closing parenthesis and then I
get "if ()"

I've tried to set/unset it to see whether it could be a wrong initialization
after build update but it did not change anything...

Problem does not happen with brackets: when I type "char[" it does not close it
automatically...

oops, left out a check in CompilationUnitEditor.BracketInserter#verifyKey
should be fixed for M2 IMO - easy and low risk.
