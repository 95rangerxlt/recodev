Integration build 1115.

Open a Java editor on the attached file.

Change the lines:
---
public class RemoteRootElement extends RemoteFolderElement {
	/**
	 * Initial implementation: return null.
	 */
---
to
---
public class RemoteRootElement extends RemoteFolderElement {
     hi
}
	/**
	 * Initial implementation: return null.
	 */
---
You must do this by placing the cursor at the end of the 'public class' line, 
pressing enter, typing 'hi', pressing enter, and typing '}'. Now double-click 
in front of the closing parenthesis to highlight the enclosed area. I.e. place 
the cursor directly to the left of the } above. Right-click and Revert. The 
editor is now hosed; it won't redraw and must be closed. This is repeatable for 
me.

Kai this is a repeatable case for the editor going blank behaviour after a 
revert that I had last week.

Java file demonstrating problem
Build > 20011123.

The problem has been that the editor tried to set a selection that ended in the 
middle of a multi character line delimiter. This causes an IAE which in 
previous builts didn't hinder the StyledText widget to remain function. In the 
new builds, the widget throws the exception and from there on, it is no longer 
usable.

From my point of view, throwing the selection is ok, but the widget should 
still be functional afterwards.
The argument is invalid, so we are throwing the exception.  There have been a 
number of subtle bugs related to partial line delimiter operations (e.g., 
deleting part of a line delimiter), so we thought it best to be more explicit 
about the fact that these operations are invalid.  

The exception that is thrown is recoverable, so if you catch it you can 
continue, but isn't it bogus to allow the illegal selection first place?
Kai, are you sure the *widget* hangs after throwing the exception? Could it be 
the exception handling/reporting code that is hanging?
This might be important for future exceptions occuring elsewhere.
