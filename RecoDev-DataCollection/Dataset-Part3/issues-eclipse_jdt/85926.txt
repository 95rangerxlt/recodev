Build id: I20050218-1600

The new contect menu actions for modifying the build path do not work on class
folders.  Remove from build path does nothing, Configure output folder and
configure exclusion pattern both throw NPEs.

1. Create 2 java projects, A and B
2. Open the build properties of project B and add a class folder classpath entry
for project A
3. Open the context menu for the classfolder created in 2 and select Build
Path->Configure Inclusion/Exclusion Filters
4. Observe a NPE will appear in the logs.  Repeat with the otehr actions in the
menu.

The following check in ClasspathModifier#getListElement is failing because the
path is <project>/bin but the element is actually <project>/src

if (element.getEntryKind() == IClasspathEntry.CPE_SOURCE &&                    
element.getPath().equals(path)) {
