In version 2.x using "Add settter/getter" will insert the methods at the end of
the class, and using "Add constructor from superclass" will insert the
constructors at the top of the class.
In version 3.0 both of this generators allow to specify the insertion point.
This makes this commands more flexible but it slows down their use, and it is
contrary to what people got used to.
Constructors by default should be inserted before the first method,
setters/getters should be inserted after the last method.

Best would be to allow the default insertion point to be specified in the options.
At a minimum the default should be the same as in 2.x

For M@ the default for constuctors is "First method". Using "First Method" as 
a default for setter/getters is indeed bogus. We should use Last Method. 

There willn't be a preference support for this.
