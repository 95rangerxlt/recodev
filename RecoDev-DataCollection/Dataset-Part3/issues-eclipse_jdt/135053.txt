My Eclipse Configuration

Here is my Eclipse configuration showing all active plug-ins and my environment.
reproduced in M6. Dirk, can you have a look? That's an intersting question: How does an update work if the element shows up twice?
AFAIK the Platform UI team added new support in TreeViewer for this.

Mhm. I think it's bug 84314. But according to the comments it looks like that the Package Explorer already uses parts of this new support.
The problem is that the package explorer content provider refreshes the package fragement root which isn't part of the My Set. That is why the package gets stale. To ways to fix:

- we only support projects as top level elements
- if we encounter a refresh we also add all elements to refresh which a child 
  of this element and are top level elements in working sets.

A patch

Martin, enclosed a patch. Let me know what you think and I will release if you want to have it in for RC1. The patch basically checks for all non project top level elements in WS and refreshes them separately if they are a child of an refreshed element.
Looks good!
Fixed for RC1.
