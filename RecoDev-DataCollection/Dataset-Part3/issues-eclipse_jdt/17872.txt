Build F1

When you hover over a reference to a static final field, the hover help seems 
to be inconsistent. Sometimes the hover help shows you the constant value of 
the field (e.g. "(int)9") and sometimes it shows you the name of the field 
(e.g. "MyClass.FOO").

My suspicion is that it shows the value only when the declararation is 
unavailable for some reason.

Both of these value are interesting and useful. It would be nice if hoverhelp 
showed BOTH values if they're available. Presumably if hover help can 
determine the declaring class, finding the field's constant value wouldn't be 
much harder.

the value is shown when there is an active debug session the qualified name is 
shown otherwise.
no action planned for 2.0
Reopening for 2.1 consideration
Hovers can now be configured:
Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Hovers page

The "inconsistent" behavior you see is the behavior of the "Best Match" hover
which tries to be smart and find the best hover for the given context. You can
assign the source hover as normal hover (i.e. when no modifier is pressed) and
the Debug hover to the Ctrl modifier.
