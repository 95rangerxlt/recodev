moved to 'active'
still a problem
Still a problem but a corner case. Leaving P4.

Moving to core
I think this is a minor defect, if it is a defect. The selected code should be a
valid piece of Java code. There is no way for the formatter to guess that the
selection is in the middle of a comment. So the first '*' will be seen an
operator and not as the line in a comment.
The refactoring has such limitation to select a valid piece of code, so it
should be the same thing for the formatter.
The whole comment should be selected, not just a part of it.
We need to clear 2.1 bug reports that won't be addressed before 2.1. The new 
implementation is still in the works. Therefore we cannot include it for 2.1. 
Not enough testing and we need to polish the preferences. This will be address 
for 2.2 as stated in the JDT/Core plan.
Resurrecting for 3.0
Reopen for 3.0 consideration.
This has to be handled by the UI. For new formatter, simply return edits.
The new formatter won't be able to start directly in the middle of a comment.
Move to JDT/UI for comment.
Tobias, this should now work, right?
The new content formatter automatically expands the region to be formatted to 
partition boundaries and, if starting with default content type partition, also 
block-aligns the region.
The content formatter therefore uses the code formatter exactly the way 
Ctrl+Shift+F5 does. The comment formatter only "patches" the comment regions 
afterwards.
