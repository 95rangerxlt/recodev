Eclipse RC2

Create a java project
Create two folders (aFolder and bFolder), both linked to the same folder in the 
filesytem
Create a file in one of the aFolder.
Open bFolder.
Drag the file from bFolder to aFolder
Say yes to overwrite
Say ok to next pop-up

An error dialog opens, details are:
/AJavaProject/bFolder/junk.java does not exist

The file is now lost.

Consider for RC3.
Not a common use case.
Investigate complexity of fix for RC3.

Not a core bug.  JDT UI is deleting the file before the resource copy/move API 
is reached.  The core copy/move methods do not allow this scenario to proceed. 
Note that this error only occurs in the package explorer.




This bug results in the user losing the file/folder that was being copied or 
moved.




Deletion occurs in MoveResourceChange.perform or CopyResourceChange.perform

real solution will come from core's fix for bug 31883
what we can maybe do is disable dropping in this case
probably my comment 4 was bogus
i have a fix but it's scary to do at this point

navigator has it easy with only files and folders :-)

package explorer has all sorts of other stuff to care about - so the fix is 
quite extensive
fixed - reviewed with Daniel Megert
