Adam, this is your code ;-)
See DCR bug 67140.
i know :)

i guess i did not notice the 'not to be implemented' thing before.
post 3.0 this should be adressed somehow. 
We should at least get rid of the anonymous subclasses. JDT/UI has one
implementation of ISourceRange.

Tobias, if you have 15 minutes can you take care of this. Most of them are in
your code.
