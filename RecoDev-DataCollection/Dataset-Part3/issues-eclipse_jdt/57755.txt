23. export Javadoc. Why are there two different icons ? I think the icon should
have '@' in it, to show it's a Javadoc operation.
14. + 15. front sheet should be right/down and not right/up; other icons have
right/down z-order (12., 13., 16, 17., 20., 24.)

Why are there still icons for refactoring _wizards_? As far as I know
refactoring uses dialogs exclusively now.

Also, is the Method icon used anywhere?

If not, why don't we deal with them in the same way we handle unused
methods/classes: get rid of them?

The new wizard icons look fantastic -- good work!
Very nice icons!
The new wizard icons are now released.
