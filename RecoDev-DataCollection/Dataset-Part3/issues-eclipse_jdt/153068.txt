fix
Steps to reproduce:
1. on a source folder invoke Build Path>Configure Output Folder...
2. Type '.'
3. Press ok
Dialog pops up saying:
Cannot nest x inside output folder y

Not for M1:
 - Patch is not simple
 - No unit tests for this code
 - Bug was already in 3.1.2
 - Nothing bad happens
 - User is informed about the problem and can workaround it
