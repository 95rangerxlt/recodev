build 20011219

1. Create a java project with two source folders, say src1 and src2
2. Add the same file (eg. foo.txt) to each source folder so that you have
  MyProject
    /bin
    /src1
      foo.txt
    /src2
      foo.txt

3. Build the project.  It will attempt to copy both foo.txt files, one from 
each source, to the destination folder.

There are two bugs:

Bug #1: The problem/marker description isn't very helpful.  It says,
"The project was not build since it is inconsistent, refresh the project and 
rebuild it."

- It doesn't say what the inconsistency is, and its suggestion of refreshing 
the project is incorrect.  I could imagine someone with two deep hierarchies 
and one accidental collision spending a lot of time scratching their head 
trying to figure this out.  Also, it would be a lot better if the marker was on 
the resource, not on the project.

- Minor possible grammar issue: I believe the message should be two sentences, 
not a sentence with a comma.


Bug #2: If you rebuild the project again, you will get an addition identical 
error.  Each build produces a new error, so you can get several of them.

If you correct the problem they all correctly go away.

A warning is now issued for the collision case.

Existing errors are now removed sooner so duplicates no longer happen.
