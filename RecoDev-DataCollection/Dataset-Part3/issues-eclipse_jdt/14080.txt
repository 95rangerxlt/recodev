Build I20020416

It is not obvious when we ask users to do some operation:
- delete: we always (i.e. whether file is open in editor or not) ask 
- drag & drop we never ask

I remember that (at least under Win 98) confirm dialogs are user-configurable:
[ ] Confirm on delete
[ ] Confirm on move
[ ] Confirm on D&D
