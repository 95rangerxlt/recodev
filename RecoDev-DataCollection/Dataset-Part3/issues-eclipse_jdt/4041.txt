In the Java perspective:
1. create 1st project by: select File> New> Other> Micro Edition Examples> Microview - Checkers
2. create 2nd project by: select File> New> Other> Java Project
3. expand package com.ibm.ive.microview.examples.checkers in the 1st project
4. select copyright.txt and from the context menu select "copy" and then the 2nd project you created

Switch to the Resource perspective:
1. select the copyright.txt file that you copied to the 2nd project
2. from the context menu select delete

After confirming delete, you get the Delete Problems dialog:
Problems encountered while deleting resources.
when I select details I get:
Resource is out of sync with the file system: /test2/copyright.txt.

I can recreate this easily with Vame but not with Eclipse.  Also I only see this if I delete in the 
Resource perspective rather than in the Java perspective - I can get the error in the resource 
perspective and then switch back to the java perspective try the same thing and the file deletes.

	This should be in the readme.

	This has nothing to do with VAME, but seems a JDT problem to me.
	There are many situations where one runs into out of sync problems when moving, deleting, renaming,
	or even catching up, when Java projects are involved.
	My usual workaround is a sync with local followed by a rebuild all.
	Moved to ITPJUI.

	Cannot reproduce in eclipse 128. Could you please outline the scenarios in which you get the out of sync
	messages when moving, deleting, etc.
