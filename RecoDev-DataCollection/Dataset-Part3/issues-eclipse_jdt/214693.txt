Steps To Reproduce:
Simple steps for add third page (not suggesting this is a valid thing to do
since the class is internal):
- subclass internal class JavaProjectWizard
- use:
    @Override
    public void addPages ()
    {
        super.addPages ();

        // Add the third page.
//        pageThree = new MyPageThree ();
//        addPage (pageThree);
    }
- try to access project from third page code.
===> when navigating to the third page, the project isn't there any more.


More information:

Since NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo.setVisible(false) removes the project (ie. the project is deleted when you navigate away from the second page), any settings which are set on this page are lost when navigating away from this page --
either back to page one or to a new page three.  So these new API classes only work if the user uses page one, then page two, then finishes.

Right this is not valid but you are allowed to use the existing API pages to create your own wizard and this doesn't work as you correctly noticed due to
NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo.setVisible(false) removing the project.

We have two choices to fix this:
1) We spec that there cannot be a third page.
2) We no longer delete the project on setVisible(false) but delete the current 
   temp project before we create a new one. This would also fix bug 214563.
>We have two choices to fix this:
A third choice would be to only delete project when we go back to the first page.

Of course it should be possible to add a third page.
I fixed setVisible 
- only remove the project when left to the first page
- only create the project when entered from the first page
Thanks very much for the fix -- I'll definitely give it a go.

I just added another JavaProjectWizard bug (Bug 216973).
