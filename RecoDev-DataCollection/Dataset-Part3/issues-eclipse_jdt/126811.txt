I updated my workspace to have the latest changes from UI and noticed a few compile errors from JDT.

1) CorrectionMarkerResolutionGenerator calls an abstract method from the superclass (in JDT/UI)

2) MockWorkbenchSite in the Refactoring tests needs to add a new method that was added to the IWorkbenchSite interface

I have rolled back some of my WorkbenchMarkerResolution changes pending this report getting fixed.
Part 1 was my fault. I've removed the super call to WorkbenchMarkerResolution#findOtherMarkers in HEAD
MockWorkbenchSite has been fixed as well > 20060208
