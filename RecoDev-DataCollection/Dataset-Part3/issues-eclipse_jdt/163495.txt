Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Java Browsing perspective
2. Open Javadoc view
3. Select a class in Types view
4. Scroll down in the Javadoc view

Result:
The selection in Project, Packages and Types is lost. When browsing classes it's tedious to always reselect the project, the package and the class. The selection shouldn't be lost when scrolling in the Javadoc view.

I think this was just another instance of bug 79591, which would call for a more general solution.
