Invoke Clean Up in a 5.0 project and check 'Add missing Annotations'. Then, invoke it on a 1.4 project.

-> The checkboc is checked and disabled. This leaves the impressions that Annotations are added, but I cannot disable this cleanup.

The disabled checkbox should not be checked. Alternatively, the whole Annotations section could be removed on 1.4-only targets.
