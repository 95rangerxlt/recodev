When I enter javadoc for methods that are overloaded I most of the times enter 
{@inheritDoc} to copy the documentation. 

But when I use the code-completion for the javadoc names I get {@inheritdoc}. 
The correct spelling according to the javadoc toolpage is {@inheritDoc}.
Note the capitalized 'D'

(I use the checkstyle plugin for checking my javadoc and there I noticed that
it wouldnt accept {@inheritdoc}.
