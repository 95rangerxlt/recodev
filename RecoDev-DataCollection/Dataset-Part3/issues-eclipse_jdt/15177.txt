In an empty workspace, auto-build off, import all prerequisite projects
for org.eclipse.jdt.core as library projects.

At the end of the import process, the xerces project is tagged with an error 
indicating boot is missing though it is present.
Problem is that projects are added and setRawClasspath(...) is called in one 
workspace runnable:

When xerces is added, boot is not yet present. Then a setRawClasspath(...) is 
done which generates a problem marker. Then boot is added. At the end of the 
workspace runnable, the delta processor refreshes the markers of boot's 
dependents only, not the marker of boot.

Fixed to refresh the markers of the added projects as well.
