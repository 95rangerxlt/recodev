I have defined a template as follows:

/*
 * Line 1
 * Line 2
 */

Use code formatter is *off*.

When I insert this template, I get:

/*
* Line 1
* Line 2
*/

The leading spaces are removed.

This is a regression in 3.1.1. It worked fine in 3.1.
Not a dup. bug 71365 is about a different formatting style (double spaces),
whereas this is about the standard formatting not working.
JavaFormatter (used by the template engine) should better support comments.
