Stable Build 20020214:
In the following code the first catch (IllegalArgumentException) Block is 
always incorrectly formatted using the context menus Format as shown here:
    try
    {
      Object target = this.getClass().getDeclaredField(field).get(this);
      Class[] targetInterfaces = target.getClass().getInterfaces();
      DelegateHandler delegate = new DelegateHandler(target);
      Object proxy =
        Proxy.newProxyInstance(
          RoleProxy.class.getClassLoader(),
          targetInterfaces,
          delegate);
      return proxy;
    }
    catch (IllegalArgumentException e)
    
      {
    }
    catch (SecurityException e)
    {
    }
    catch (IllegalAccessException e)
    {
    }
    catch (NoSuchFieldException e)
    {
    }

I cannot find a workaround. For me it's critical to use in production, but for 
others it will rather seem to be cosmetic.

Olivier - Can you please investigate a fix (if simple) ?
I reproduced the problem. I'll try to investigate a fix for it.
I am investigating a solution. The .class inside the code is responsible of the bad formatting. If 
you simply replace RoleProxy.class with RoleProxy, it works fine. The class literal seems to 
have a pretty bad side effect on the formatter.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
