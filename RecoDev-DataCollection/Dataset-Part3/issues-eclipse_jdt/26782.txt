Set up your Eclipse as follows:

Editors|Number of Editors open before closing: 1
Editors|When all editors are dirty or pinned|Open new editor

Java|Link XXX to active editor|ON

Show the Java Browsing views..

Then, open a single java file, from some package, say foo.bar.  It's useful it 
if extends some other class in some other package, say ee.by.

Now, click on the extended class name (E.g. ee.by.BaseClass) and press F3.

Part of what you expect to happen does, the editor changes to show the class 
defining BaseClass.

HOWEVER, the Java Browsing views do not update.  They will still show package 
foo.bar, and your original class.

This ONLY happens if you have one open editor.  If you have more than one, 
things are fine.

I suspect the problem is that the refresh of the Java browsing views takes 
place when the focus changes from one editor to another.  With only one editor 
open, the focus never changes and the views never update.

Since many people switched to Eclipse from VAJ, they are used to only having 
one open editor and will probably find this somewhat irritating.

Stupid me. Got addressed for M5.
