One can export a jar with source code. If this jar is added as a depndent external jar , it's source can be viewed without having an entry in the source attachment. I am unable to set the encoding for this kind of jars. 
If I change the encoding for this kind of jar and click OK, the dialog box gets dismissed, but If I open the dialog box again, I don't see the changes. 
UI should allow to set the encodings without the need to specify the source attachment.

I had disabled specification of encoding without the specification of source attachment on purpose, thinking that this was wrong. I will fix this.

Setting the encoding works, but when I open the dialog again, then "Workspace location" is checked and the combo contains the wrong source encoding.
