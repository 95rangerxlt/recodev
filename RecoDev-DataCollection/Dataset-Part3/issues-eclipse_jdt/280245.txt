I20090611-1540 (had it on Cocoa and WinXP)

The properties file editor screws the selection on double-click for certain properties:

- Have a.properties with content:
123.ch: Hello

- double-click before '2'
=> selection is '23.c'
=> expected: whole property 'abc.ch' selected or just 'abc' (like in 3.4.2)
