When an already selected item is dragged the drop does not work. This is 
because the item is deselected by the drag click on some platforms. 
Navigator has the same problem. The drag is started because the selection is 
not checked but there is no drag data that can be set for the drop.
See bug 30655/bug 30249 for details on how to fix this.

Note that this is only a problem with Ctrl drag (i.e., copy) because ctrl click 
deselects.
I fixed the code. Adam, can you please check that it does the right thing under 
Linux GTK. If so please close.
