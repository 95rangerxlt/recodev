build M5:

Changing a Project's Java build dependencies by adding/removing a project on 
the build path does not report a file write error. During the add/remove if 
the .project file is read only it is not modified nor is an error dialog 
reported.
Fixed this scenario by triggering the project reference update before modifying 
the actual classpath. If it fails, the classpath setting is not performed at 
all.

However, identified a bug in the platform, if an exception occurs during 
the .project file writing, the project references are left inconsistent in 
memory (see bug 14396).

Fixed for the JDT/Core part, bug 14396 describes the Platform/Core part of this 
defect.
