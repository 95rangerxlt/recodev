I wanted to generate my own file template which would already use $Revision$ 
and $Log$ keywords. $ sign starts Eclipse variables in templates and I receive 
error "template has incomplete variables".

How to produce:
Menu: Window->Preferences->Java->Templates.
Choose template and edit template. Try to insert $Revision$.
I cannot confirm my new template.

Bye,
Piotr
