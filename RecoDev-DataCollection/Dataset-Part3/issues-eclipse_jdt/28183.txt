search for refs to Test in junit
sorting 224 results takes almost 3 seconds
a lot (36%) of that time is spent in sorting the results
most of that time, in turn, is spent in calculating the text

With my JUnit source I only get 136 references to type "Test" and could not find
severe sorting problems. I then tried the following test case:

  Search for method references to *test*. 

This revealed the problems with sorting:
- Override indicators have to go away
- The most expensive thing is getting the text where the Java element is created
from the handle each time

Another problem is the exists() test when getting the image.

Fixed all of these cases.
It's now very fast!
