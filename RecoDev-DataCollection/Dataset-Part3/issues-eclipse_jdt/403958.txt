Paul, I don't understand why we need to wait for the I20130326-0800 build to release the R3_8_maintenance patch. Can you clarify please?
It was to give others time to comment on bug 403352, there was a discussion going on.

Actually, I was aware of that. But just wasn't sure why only the 3_8 patch had that comment. Thanks for clarifying anyway.
Jay, it's now OK to commit the patches (deadline is tomorrow monring), but please exclude all additions of 'forceQualifierUpdate.txt'
All patches released except the forceQualifierUpdate additions.
At this point we won't be making the changes related to the forceQualifierUpdate. Marking as resolved.
