Build 20021114

Attempting to replace some text with clipboard content, it ends up overriding 
the prefix of the target text only (target is larger than clipboard):

select 'argSlotSize'
and paste it over selected word argSlotSizeze .
It will leave some of the selected word in.

testcase:

package p;

public class Y {
	static void y(){
		int argSlotSize = 1; 
		argSlotSizeze += 2;	}
}

It doesn't happen if I turn off the smart pasting.
