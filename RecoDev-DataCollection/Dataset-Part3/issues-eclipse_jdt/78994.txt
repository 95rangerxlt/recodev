I use eclipse v3.0.0 on Windows 2000. When we select "No tab character" i.e.
"Use only spaces" in the code style. It works whenever we press the "tab" key
directly. But the auto indent feature which automatically indents the body of
"if" statements etc. still uses real tabs instead of spaces. Hence, this feature
should  be modified so that it follows the same setting (use tab character or dont).


NOTE: This severely affects the usage of eclipse in my organisation (Trilogy)
which pays a lot of importance to coding style.

Gili, is this a Java Editor problem?
Assume that this is when you just type in the Java Source Editor not when JVE
generated an if{} block when it creates a new init. method
This is regarding the problem of tabs to white space conversion in Eclipse 3.0.1. 
I have unchecked the checkbox 'Use Tab Character' in Window -> Preferences ->
Java -> Code Style -> Code Formatter -> Show (button)  -> Indentation (tab).
Doing this works fine only for one level of indentation. i.e. If I have a code
like this, 
class A
{
    public void func1()
    {
        a++;
    }
}
After setting eclipse to use spaces instead of tabs, there are no tabs between
public void func1() and start of the col. but, when it comes to a++, the first 4
chars are spaces and following that there is a tab character and then 'a'. More
specifically, when I press enter after the opening brace, '{', Only the first 4
chars are spaces and the rest are tabs. Hope to get a patch for this soon.
Thanks.

This stemmed from the discrepancy of the two separate tab settings (one in
formatter, one in editor (see bug 19036). This has been fixed for M4.
