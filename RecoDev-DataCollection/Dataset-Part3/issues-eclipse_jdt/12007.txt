validation uses IPackageFragmentRoot.isArchive() which returns true even this 
is a source folder

I believe the JavaModel is also often checking the path termination as well, as 
opposed to a systematic file/resource access.
Fixed by checking if the type of the resource is a FILE when the jar package 
fragment root is created. If it is a FOLDER, a regular root is created even if 
the resource name ends with .jar.
