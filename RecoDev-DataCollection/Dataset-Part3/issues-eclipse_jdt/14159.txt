Build M4:

my classes have 2 newlines between methods.  If I make a change, and then 
revert, the reverted text only has 1 newline between methods.

Problem still exists in M5
Cannot reproduce in F2. Is there anything special about your files, such as 
heterogenous line delimiters etc.?
I don't see it anymore either, but I can tell you my source code came from 
Leapfrog.  So it had whatever line delimiters were used there.

Erich could reproduce this in M5, I assume you were able to reproduce it on 
older builds?
Closed as this seems to be gone.
