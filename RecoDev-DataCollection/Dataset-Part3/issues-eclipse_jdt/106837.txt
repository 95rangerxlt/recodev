Packages selected for javadoc generation using the Project -> Generate JavaDoc
-> "Select types for which javadoc should be generated" treeview are not stored as 
a project-specific setting. 

I have a src folder with a mixture of auto-generated and custom packages and
don't want to generate docs for the auto-generated classes. Currently, I have to
deselect all auto-generated packages each time I want to generate javadocs.

I think the initially checked elements are evaluated from the currect selection.

If you want to run the Javadoc wizard on a fixed set of resources, better save
the export as an ant file (3rd page of the wizard)
Thanks for your help - I admit I'm always only using the wizard's first page :-)
