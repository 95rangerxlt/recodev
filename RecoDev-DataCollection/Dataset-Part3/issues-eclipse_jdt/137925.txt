Assume that I write the following line within some Java (>=1.4) method:

    assert checkFoo() : "foo fails" ;

Assume also that method 'checkFoo()' has not yet been defined.
I now use Quick Assist (CTRL+1) on "checkFoo()" to create 
the method. This results in the following construct:

    private Object checkFoo() {
        // ... some code template expanded here ...
    } 

The problem is, that the result type is 'Object',
but should be 'boolean', because the assert statement
demands this.
