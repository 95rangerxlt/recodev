I have a factory class used like so:

this.setConnectionManager(FooFactory.newConnectionManager(binding));

This all compiles fine. I want to change the factory to be instance based. I 
change the above to:

this.setConnectionManager(new FooFactory().newConnectionManager(binding));

This no longer compiles and the only quick fix available changes the code back 
(correctly of course) to the existing static usage.

I would like an new quick fix that changes the factory method from static to 
non-static.

This would allow me to continue coding in the current class w/o switching to 
the factory and back.

Thank you for considering this request.
