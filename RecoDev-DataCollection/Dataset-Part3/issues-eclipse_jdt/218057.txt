The javadoc for AnnotationMirror.getElementValues() states that the returned map "matches the order in which the values appear in the annotation's source".

Within the AnnotationMirrorImpl implementation of this API, we save the values to a HashMap, thus destroying the order.  This should instead be a SortedHashMap.

Fixed for 3.4M7.  Also added regression test to compiler.apt ElementTests.
