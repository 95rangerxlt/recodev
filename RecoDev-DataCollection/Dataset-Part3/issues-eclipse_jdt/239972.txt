The following text should be better:
type references used in an <code>instance of</code> condition.

Change released in org.eclispe.jdt.doc.isv R3_4_maintenance branch.

Even better would be to use the actual literal <code>instanceof</code>. ;-)

And IIRC, it is not for types in the whole instanceof condition, so even more better would be:
 * Return only type references used as type of an <code>instanceof</code> check.
(or '... condition.' or '... expression.').

I only see it in HEAD, so far.

Oh, the change in the doc plug-in has been released in both branches, but the change in the API (IJavaSearchConstants#INSTANCEOF_TYPE_REFERENCE) has only been released to HEAD (so it is still wrong in R3_4_maintenance branch in the generated API documentation).

I would still fix it as outlined in comment 2 (in both places and branches).
Thanks Markus for the doc change :-)
I've released your comment 2 (expression) proposal in HEAD stream, but I won't plan to change it in R3_4_maintenance stream...
