This only happens with java projects in package explorer which is why I open on JDT.

- Start with fresh workspace
- Create new java project in package explorer
- Delete the project
- Right click in package explorer
- Bug: I see an "Open Project" menu item

This item wasn't there if I right clicked before creating the project.

You're right, this could be a bit more cleverer and test if there are any projects.
