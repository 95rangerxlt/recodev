Unhandled event loop exception
Reason:
java.lang.NullPointerException

See .log file (will be attached)

=== Expected behaviour:
No exception

=== Reproducibility: yes

.log file with exceptions
The error occurs on the line:

1912:  if (isRootInputChange && fWorkingSetModel.needsConfiguration()) {

It looks like fWorkingSetModel can legally be null, so this code should check for that.
