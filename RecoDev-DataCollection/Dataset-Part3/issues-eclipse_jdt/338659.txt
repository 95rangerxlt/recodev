In official builds, we'd like to ignore unavoidable generic type problems, but jdt_api_compile.htm doesn't list a -warn argument to control this option in the batch compiler.

If I see that correctly, bug 322817 already added the option "unavoidableGenericProblems" in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.batch.Main.handleErrorOrWarningToken(..), so I guess the only problem is in the docs.

I'll update the doc as Srikanth is focusing on java 7 work.
Released for 3.7M6.
