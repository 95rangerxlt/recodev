Build id: 200302131253

Create a new class, check the "public static void main(String[] args)" checkbox
in the wizard. 
Put the cursor after the method declaration, hit enter.  The cursor is now
inside the method, on a blank line, tabbed to the right of the method declaration.

Now type "for", hit Ctrl-space, and select "for - iterate over a collation". 
Notice that the inserted template is shifted to the left by one tab.

seems fixed on I200405280010. Closing, given that the template stuff has
undergone major changes since the report.
