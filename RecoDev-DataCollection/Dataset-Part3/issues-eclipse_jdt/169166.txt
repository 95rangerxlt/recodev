Build ID: M20060629-1905

Steps To Reproduce:
In the following example, JUnit reports no failures, doesn't finish properly (progress information is not updated to show that the test has concluded) and doesn't continue processing tests.

import org.junit.Test;
public class Sample {
    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        throw new RuntimeException() {
            public String getMessage() {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("whatever");
            }
        };
    }
}
