TypeHierarchyViewPart should call ReorgGroup.createDeleteAction

see PackageExplorerViewPart
i added
actionBars.setGlobalActionHandler(IWorkbenchActionConstants.DELETE,  
ReorgGroup.createDeleteAction(fSelectionProviderMediator));
to the type hierarchy viewer.
doesn't work as the edit->delete action is disabled in non-editor views.
The enablement behaviour should be changed to also correctly work in the type 
hierarchy.
fixed in TypeHierarchyViewPart by running the same code as in 
PackageExplorerViewPart
