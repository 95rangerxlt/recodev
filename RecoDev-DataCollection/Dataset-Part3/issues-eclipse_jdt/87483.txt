Assume the following two files:

file Base.java:
public class Base {
   public class inner {}
}

file Derrived.java:
public class Derrived extends Base {
   public void foo() {
       inner bar = new inner();
   }
}


If I now select the "new inner()" and choose refactoring-Extract local variable
(usually Alt-Shift-L), eclipse does not recognize, that inner is already visible
and want to include "Base.inner", which fails.

Ciao, Imi.
