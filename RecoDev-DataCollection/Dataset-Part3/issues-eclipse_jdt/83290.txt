Rename Method for Annotation Elements must handle the element named "value"
specially.

a.) When an element is renamed to "value", the user should have the option to
remove "value=" at the call sites.

b.) When the element "value" is renamed to something else, all
SingleMemberAnnotations must be converted into NormalAnnotations (add "newName="
... ).

See also bug 83230 (search for annotation elements).

Test cases (RenameMethodInInterfaceTests#testAnnotation1() & #testAnnotation2()):

@I(12)
@interface I {
    @I(value=13)
    int value(); // rename to "thing"
}

@J(thing="Description")
@interface J {
    String thing(); // rename to "value"
}

b) is implemented in HEAD
a) is defered until post 3.1
b.) is good enough
