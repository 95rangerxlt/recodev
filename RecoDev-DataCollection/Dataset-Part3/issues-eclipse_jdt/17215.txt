There seems to be an inconsistency between quickfixable compile time vs. 
temporary errors (in case the format gets garbled the following is a 3-row/5-
column table :-)

error kind    wiggly   overview   lightbulb erroricon
temporary       yes       yes        yes       no
compile time    yes       yes        no        yes

This results in the following inconsistencies for end users:
- only temporary errors have an icon in the vertical ruler if they are 
quickfixable.
- it is not apparent that compile time errors are quickfixable

Suggestion:
- whenever there is a wiggly line in the text or an error in the overview bar an
  error icon must be shown in the vertical ruler
- if the error is quickfixable, the error icon should have a lightbulb overlay
- double clicking on an quickfixable error opens the quickfix proposal;
  double clicking on an error reveals the marker in the task list.

this has been improved - no further action planned on this bug
