1. Build a (binary) selfhosting workspace from scratch using build 20020501 and
the plugin import wizard.
2. Open DebugUIPlugin from the Java perspective.  
3. In the Outline view select setAttributes(Element,
LaunchConfigurationHistoryElement).  
4. Right click and select References->Workspace.  You will get no results.  

If you look at the method above it (getRecentLaunchAsXMLElement) you will see a
reference to the method, so there are references.

More info on this:

If I search for declarations of 	getHistoryEntryAsXMLElement(org.w3c.dom.Document
doc, LaunchConfigurationHistoryElement element) or
getRecentLaunchAsXMLElement(org.w3c.dom.Document doc,
LaunchConfigurationHistoryElement element) I get no results.  These methods were
the references to setAttributes.

Then I imported the plugin as a source plugin and all of the searches worked.
Moving to JDT core as the index appears to be incorrect.
MatchLocator failed to create a method handle when the attached source 
contained a method declared with a fully qualified name.

Fixed.
