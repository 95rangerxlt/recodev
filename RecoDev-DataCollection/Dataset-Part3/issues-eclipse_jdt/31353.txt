1. select NoCorrectionProposal.showDebugInfo, 'move method'
2. move it to CorrectionContext
3. NoCorrectionProposal will get an error as the method was created private.
in fact there are two problems:
first the new indirection call fCorrectionContext.showDebugInfo(this);
fails as showDebugInfo was created private. then in the method all references 
to NoCorrectionProposal are not visible as well

maybe add a check box to offer to fix visibility
Time permitted for 2.1

Note that inline doesn't do visibility fixing as well. But this case is 
slightly different since it is the move method.
For 3.1 we should try to come up with a better visibility story inside 
refactoring.
