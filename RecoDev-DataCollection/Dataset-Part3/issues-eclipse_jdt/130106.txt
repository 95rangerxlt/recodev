Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20060217-1115

Certain runs of an individual test suite (such as InnerEmulationTest from JDT/Core compiler tests) is displaying individual testcase in hierarchical mode, in a live fashion.
Some other runs did only show the test suite, not individual tests.

It seems related to having pressed the 'scroll lock' button.

If not pressing, testcase progress is shown. It pressing twice the 'scroll lock' button, testcase progress is gone.

Should use a TableViewer for flat mode.
Sorry, didn't make it for M6. Will fix for RC1.
