4 Test cases with code from bug 160312 comment 0:
- original code                 -- clean ups "convert for loop" & "add blocks"
- original code                 -- clean up "convert for loop" alone
- with System.out.println(x[i]) -- clean ups "convert for loop" & "add blocks"
- with System.out.println(x[i]) -- clean up "convert for loop" alone

All don't work as expected (both for loops correctly converted).

I will rewrite the loop converter code in M5. The code has too many (major) bugs and is very hard to maintain.
