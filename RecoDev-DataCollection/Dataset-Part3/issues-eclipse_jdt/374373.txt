draft

This is a quick draft.

Ayush, since you were learning this stuff recently for the tutorial at EclipseCon, can you also take a look and see if any more details are required?
Looks good. Small points:
1) You might want to include one line on what's a quick fix and quick assist.
2) You might want to tell the user the difference between three types of processors, or just an example for where each should be preferred? (This is something even i'm not clear about)

I can add a link to the user doc, which explains the difference.

3 types? Are you referring to 'org.eclipse.jface.text.quickassist.IQuickAssistProcessor' as the third type?
