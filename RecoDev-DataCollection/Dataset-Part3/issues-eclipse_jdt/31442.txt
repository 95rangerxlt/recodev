Whenever you attempt to modify a read-only file a dialog pops up saying there 
was a problem editing the file. It would be nice if on that dialog there was a 
key that allowed you to change the attribute of that file to writable and then 
perform the attempted operation.

I've noticed that Eclipse has started using message boxes with a "Don't ask me
again" checkbox.  What about adding a similar checkbox to the read-only error
dialog that says "Make file writable"?
any chance this could be looked at for 3.0?
It seems this is available in the latest integration build!
Which one would that be?

I meant which command and which short cut.
If you try and edit a read-only file a dialog pops up asking if you would like 
to make the file writeable. This was my original request in comment #1
Although I suppose that my request was more general and if you try and for 
example "Organize Imports" on a bunch of read only files it doesn't prompt you 
to make them writable and then peform the requested operation.
This has been fixed by Platform Core: They now show the dialog when
IWorkspace.validateEdit is called and the project isn't shared.

Regarding the operations that don't ask: you'll have to file separate bug
reports: they probably don't call IWorkspace.validateEdit.
