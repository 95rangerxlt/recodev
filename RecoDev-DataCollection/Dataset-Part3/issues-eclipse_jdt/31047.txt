In build 2.1.M4, I expected the New Package dialog to pre-fill the package 
enrty field with the current package to make it easier to create a "sub-
package".

For example, in the Java Browsing Perspective:
o Select a package.
o Right-click and choose New/Package...

The Name value is empty. I think it would be much nicer if this value was the 
current package name. 

I run into this every time I want to create a new package.

This got addressed for M5.
