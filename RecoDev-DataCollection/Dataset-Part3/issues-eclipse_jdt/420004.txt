Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=5f896427045ab356367fce2a05fd03c24fb055b2

One add thing is the value() type is initialized with FieldBindings and
the enumerations as one would expect. This is consistent with how
other targets are initialized.
