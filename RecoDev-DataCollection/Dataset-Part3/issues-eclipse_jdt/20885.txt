preference explort
The problem appears in the following situation:
- preference "synchronize outline page on cursor move" is enabled
- filter set on outline page
- container of search result to be revealed is not visible in the outliner, 
because of the filter setting

Risk of fix: minimal (See attachment.)

patch for JavaEditor and CompilationUnitEditor
Consequences if not fixed: the existing behaviour is highly annoying and 
signficantly impacts the usability of the single element view in conjunction 
with searching, both features are important in Eclipse. So this could be 
considered as a "usability stop ship"
