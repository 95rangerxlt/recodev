Test Pass for build I20020122.

Copy a file from package A to B and watch the dialog: there is a missing
resource message which quickly appears and then goes away.
the problem comes from class
CopyResourceElementsOperation

method getMainTaskName()
returns "Missing message: operation.copyResourceProgress in: 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.util.messages"

org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.core.util.Util was used instead of 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.util.Util.
Fixed.
