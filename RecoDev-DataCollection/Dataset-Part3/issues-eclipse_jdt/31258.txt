Martin, can you have a look?
maybe it's easy enough to fix for 2.1
should be easy
good to have such a good tester ;)
again, not before tuesday next week
right on!
Adam, can you check with the latest version (I use jdt.ui from head)

public class Test {
int[] test;
}
works for me there. Note that the action is always enabled.

I checked the enable state and strangely enough the method  
selectionChanged(IStructuredSelection selection) is only called for the first 
change of a selection and never again.

The policy is to check for action enablement, right?
it's not always enabled

i mean, it is but only in the editor
in the outliner it does something different and this something different is 
incorrect

the bug is in AddDelegateMethodsAction.canEnableOn(IField[] fields)
or in hasPrimitiveType (depends how you look at it)

btw, did MA also ask you for tests? 
if not, can you have a look at our tests and write some for your action?
(the bugs you fixed are good candidates for stuff that should be tested)
write to me if you need help


[enable state]
ah, got it, thought its only on context and source menu
its fixed (MA should close the bug)

[test]
well, I knew this would come up sooner or later. I downloaded the jdt.ui.test 
from cvs, will have a look
fixed by attachment 3510 (> 20030217)
[test]
i always _start_ with tests - then it's actually fun to implement them one by 
one
and when you're done, you have a suite of tests ready, for free and for keeps
