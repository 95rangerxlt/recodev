Try to 'Change Method Signature' on 'change()'. The error message dialog always
shows up twice.

Not critical for 3.0. 

Markus, we have this in for a while. Right ?
We have it in M9, but not in M8.

The fix is easy and local:
ModifyParametersAction#startRefactoring() has a new UserInterfaceStarter() {..}
which calls
   super.activate(refactoring, parent, save);
twice for this execution path.

The fix is to delete these 2 lines:
	} else {
		super.activate(refactoring, parent, save);

Patch

The patch also moves the
   return;
out of the then block. This makes sure that no bogus error message is shown
after the user has canceled the dialog which asked to perform the refactoring
on a top-of-ripple method.
Released the patch to HEAD.
