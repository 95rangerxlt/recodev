When formatting a selected region in a text file, the indentation depends only on
the first line in the selection, rather than on the stuff that comes before the
selection. Thus, if I have this:

  ...
  int a = 1;
foo();
foo2();
  ...

And select the region "foo();\nfoo2();" and format it, the bad indentation will
stay the same. Only if I select "  int a = 1; ...  foo2();" things will be
indented properly.

If you only want to adjust indentation you can select the code (lines 
containing foo(), and foo2()) and press tab. Is this what you are looking for ?
You can use the "Correct Indentation" action in the newest builds to accomplish
what you request.
