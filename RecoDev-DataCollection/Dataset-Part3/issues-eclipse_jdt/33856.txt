select something in outliner
go to -> referring test
if there's no tests you get dialog 'No Tests Found that 
reference 'whatyouselected'' (btw, note the bogus cases in the message)

the dialog is wrongly parented - it has null as 'shell'
(so it shows in the windows taks list (at the bottom of my screen))

fixed the typo, but the dialog is properly parented. It is an ordinary 
MessageDialog.
nope :)
to see it - select org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.Assert
and choose go to > referring test

the dialog  opened in TestMethodSelectionDialog line 106 has null as parent

oops, you are correct, code should have called getParentShell() instead of 
getShell().
