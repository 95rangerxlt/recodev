The "Edit" and "Advanced" buttons should only be enabled in the Factory Path dialog when there is an item selected.  I think this is a regression.

Fixed.  Problem was that the enable/disable code wasn't getting called at all, in the case where there were no items in the list.  Now we default the buttons to disabled and let them get enabled only if there is a selection.
