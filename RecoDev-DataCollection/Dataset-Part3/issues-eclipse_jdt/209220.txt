Build ID: 3.3

Steps To Reproduce:
I make a new Java Project, the Create a Java Project dialog has an odd tab order.
Under JRE there are two radio buttons for default and a project specific JRE. If
you stay on default and press tab, it takes you to “Configure Default…” and then
to the next box for Project Layout. However, if you select the project specific
JRE, the tab order still goes from the radio button to the “Configure default…”
before going to the combo box to select the JRE.



More information:
It is not a huge issue for Keyboard navigation, but when JAWS screen reader is
active, the tab order would be confusing for a blind user. They would not
necessarily understand that the combo box is associated with “Use a project
specific JRE” because the focus does not go directly from one to the other. If
there is a way to go from the radio button to the combo box, even if you must
then go to the “Configure defaults…” link it would be better than the way it is
now.

the ordering of controls is in NewJavaProjectWizardPageOne#JREGroup, sending to jdt.ui for comment
You are right. Pressing TAB after the project setting should first go to the combo.
The tabbing order can be configured on the parent composite.
