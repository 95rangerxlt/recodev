Threaddump during freeze

Configuration details
Eclipse freezes often a day. If I enable clearcase support, I have to start IDE 10 to 20 times until I can work w/o freezing. The latest freeze (see threaddump) is with disconnected clearcase. During compiling an editing a class IDE suddenly freezes and does not respond any more.

This part looks suspicious:

"Worker-0" prio=6 tid=0x05f9bc00 nid=0x2460 sleeping[0x096af000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE

	at java.io.File.list(Unknown Source)

Could you play around with Refresh prefs under General > Workspace and see if it makes any difference?	

The freeze took place when you wanted to Extract Method, right?
In addition, could create extra dump or two during the freeze. We could check them for similarities then.
Tentatively target for 3.8.1 May need resetting after analysis.

Thx, all dumps indicate there is a running job which refresh files in your local fs. I guess this is the culprit. Is there a project in your workspace containing a large number of files? Could you try closing it and see if it helps? Have you tried changing the prefs I mentioned in comment 4?
I currently checked "Refresh using native hooks or polling" and that one seems to keep Eclipse responsive...
Since there is a workaround available (see the comment above) I'm lowering severity.
Tom, are we still waiting for some information to reproduce this
locally ? If so, could you add needinfo as a keyword with a clear
indication of what would be useful (in comment)
Jan, can you confirm there is a project in your workspace containing a huge number of files? Does is contain any (symbolic) links?

Another bigger project
Are these project huge?
I added the classpath of the two biggest projects in my workspace...

Does the number include classes from:
	...
	<classpathentry combineaccessrules="false" kind="src" path="/InfraController"/>
	<classpathentry combineaccessrules="false" kind="src" path="/UserInterface_Base"/>
	...

Have you tried closing this project and leaving the "refresh" options untouched?
Fixed with 4.4
