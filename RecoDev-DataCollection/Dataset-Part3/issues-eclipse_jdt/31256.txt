public class Fd {
String[] array;
}

select 'array' 
all method from String get generated - most of which cannot be invoked on 
'String[]'

the only methods that _can_ be invoked on array types are methods from
java.lang.Object

(all arrays are subtypes of: 
java.lang.Object, 
java.lang.Cloneable and 
java.io.Serializable 

but the 2 interfaces are empty and do not have superinterfaces, so only methods 
from Object can be generated here)
