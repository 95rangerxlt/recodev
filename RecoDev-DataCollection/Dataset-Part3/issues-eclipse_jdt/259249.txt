From bug 258917.
Split into two separate bug report for individual method.

This one is not implemented for PARAMETER elements.
In order to fix this one, we need a backpointer from the argument binding onto the enclosing method binding. This is not in place right now.
Fixed for 3.5M5.  See patch in bug 258917.
