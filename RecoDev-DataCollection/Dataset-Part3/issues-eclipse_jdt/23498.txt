I have no idea what a closing parent is. You must mean parenthesis :-)

It's more complicated than that. The right way is to track all curly braces, 
brackets and parenthesis of the default Java partition and skip only if the 
tree structure is ok. In all other cases, the closing parenthesis, bracket or 
curly braces are inserted.
