Open is a heavy operation (allocates a lot of resources) and is therefore not 
comparable to something like open file. So we shouldn't assign this to double 
click.
what about a pop-up asking the user if they want to open the project? Or making 
it a configurable setting?
besides. Why else would you double click on a closed project?
Reopening it to reset the resolution state.
Setting as FIXED per bug 167554.
