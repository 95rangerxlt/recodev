When enabling the automatic formatting of Javadoc/comment sections 
(Preferences > Java > Work in Progress) the action "Source > Format" 
(Ctrl+Shift+F) fails with a null pointer exception.

Reason:
Call to "IDocument.getPartition(int)" 
in "org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.comment.CommentFormatter#format(String, 
int, int[], String) : String" returns "IDocument.DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE", for 
which no comment factory object is available.

Fix:
Correct fix is to use "IDocumentExtension3#getPartition(String, int)" with 
IJavaPartitions.JAVA_PARTITIONING to get the correct partition type.

Patch to fix NPE (no comment line type available for comment region type)
Fix candidate for M3.

Will put it into I20030826 (low risk, new class)
