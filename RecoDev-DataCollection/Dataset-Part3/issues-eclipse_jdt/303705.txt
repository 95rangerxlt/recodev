Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

Consider an instance of org.eclipse.search.ui.text.Match with an element that is neither an IResource nor an IJavaElement. It might be an element in a class diagram, for example.

When such an element is reported, it will be shown as a plain, flat element in the otherwise hierarchical java search results view. This is because the LevelTreeContentProvider and its superclasses only check for IJavaElement and IResource.

I propose to also check for IAdaptable and try to adapt to IJavaElement and IResource, if the other checks fail. I'll attach a patch.

Reproducible: Always

Patch addressing the issue

With this patch applied, the search results are perfectly included in the hierarchy, as long as they adapt to IResource or IJavaElement.
Thanks for the patch, released to HEAD.
