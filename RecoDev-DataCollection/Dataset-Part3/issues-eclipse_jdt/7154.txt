1. I would like a wizard to create methods (ala VisualAge).

2. If I have written a method call in a class for a method that does not exist, 
I would like to eb able to select it and invoke the 'method creation wizard' 
which opens with as much of the method details filled in as possible 
(arguments, name, etc).

This feature (as well as a comprehensive field creation wizard) is already 
available as part of CodePro Studio...

Hi eric,
I don't believe that Code Pro can do the second of my suggestions. Any plans 
for that ?

I fully agree that item 2)is much more interesting than item 1). Method and 
field wizards are not committed for 2.0.

Support for generating a new method stub (or adding a method to an interface) 
from a method reference is a feature we would like to see as well. However, for 
2.0 this cannot be a committed item.

OK cool, I'll wait for this in version 3.0 ;)
2) can now be achived using 'Quick Fix'.
Having a method marked as unresolvable, Quick Fix offer you to create a method 
stub.
(Also in other CU's, but currently only when the other CU is already open in an 
editor (Will change, waiting for inrastructure).
