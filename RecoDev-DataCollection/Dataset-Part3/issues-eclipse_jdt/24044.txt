I'm using french translation of Eclipse. Translation is quite good... 
But, there is a bug with templates. Predefined variables in templates have been
translated (for example, $cursor is $curseur in french). The problem is that the
templates are still using english variables... I don't really unterstand why
these variables have been translated.

Variables name and description are in a translated .properties file :
JavaTemplateMessages_fr.properties in
/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.nl1_2.0.0/nl1.jar 

But default template are in a XML file that is not translated :
default-templates.xml in /eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.ui_2.0.1/jdt.jar
So this xml file contains templates containing the english variable name. It
looks like those template are not preprocessed to replace variable names by
their translated version.

A quick workaround is to delete JavaTemplateMessages_fr.properties from the jar
file.
"Unassign" PRs because of changes in staffing
Kevin, who is working with the translators?
The template name is no longer read form properties file.
