build I20040303

- opened org.eclipse.ui.internal.skins.newlook.BasicStackPresentation (new in 
head)
- the outline showed lots of local types
- selected Hide Local Types
- still had many local types showing
- took me a while to realize that these were just the ones in field initializers

I would expect all local types to be suppressed, whether within a method or 
field or static initializers.
