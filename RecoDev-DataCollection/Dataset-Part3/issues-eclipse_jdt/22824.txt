Would be great if one could filter out those import declaration sections in 
package explorer or outline view. There are often so many lines of those import 
lines, that they disturb.

Agreed, we should add an Appearance option whether imports are shown.
It may be confusing for the user when we use filters and when we use a 
preference page (appearance).
But in some projects / views it may be useful to hide or show import trees 
independent of a preference page. It's more flexible so, but of course it's 
also confusing: different problem: imagine you have a filter for your project 
which shows only certain packages of your source directory, then you add a new 
class in a new package - it is not shown...
View menu -> Filter -> Check "Hide import declarations"
has been added for Package Explorer and Members view - not for Outline view.

Note: if Outline view would use the CustomFilterGroup and add corresponding
section to XML then it would get this too.

Changed summary category to [Outline]

Outliner supports the "Go into top level type" action which removes imports as 
well. Moving to text to consider adding import filtering as well.
Fixed.
