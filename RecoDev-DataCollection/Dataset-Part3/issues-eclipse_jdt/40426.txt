I'm a new user to Eclipse.  Today I tried to set up the display of print 
margins in the java editor.  I knew (from previous explorations of 
preferences) that the Workbench section of the preferences dialog had an 
Editors section.  I went there and changed the settings to text editor.  It 
seemed that since this was the only Editor listed, and "Editors" seemed to a 
rather inclusive term to be using, that all editing functionality was 
controlled through there.

As I later find out, this is not the case.  The Java section has it's own 
editor section, which is in no way connected to the Workbench editors.  
Ideally, I feel that all editor preferences should be in one place.  It would 
make it easier for the user to not only figure out which editor needs to be 
changed, but to learn which editors are available in the application.

Even more than this, I have a beef with both the Eclipse-way and NetBeans-way 
of dealing with editors.  (I have a lot more experience with NetBeans.)  Some 
settings are common to all editors, and I've found that I want them changed in 
all editors.  Print margin display is one of them.  It is irritating to have 
to find all the different places to change the setting -- especially if 
they're spread out through the preferences.

Anyhoo.  Enough of a rant for now.

I agree that there should be general editor settings which are inherited by
other editors similar to the font story.

For clarification: This will not happen until there is a unified preference 
story provided by the platform. Preferences can be either component oriented 
(the original Eclipse style) or function oriented (see workbench fonts). 
Currently we are in the middle of nowhere. Editors are just one example where 
this problem surfaces.
Has been fixed a while ago.
