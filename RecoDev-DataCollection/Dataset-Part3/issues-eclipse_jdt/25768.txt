Thought this might be due to decorators that I had on at the time, so I turned 
them all off.  Got the same behaviour.

org.eclipse.ui was expanded one level when I did the refresh.
Nick
- did you extract the file outside Eclipse?
- which layout did you use (flat or hierarchical)?
- what was the path of the files (org.eclipse.ui)?

Jennifer,

please investigate if this is related to the new layout feature.

The new Hierarchical layout feature doesn't deal with non-java resources as in 
Nick's example so it never handels any Deltas. However I've found that turning 
off redraw in the methods postAdd and postRemove in the 
PackageExplorerContentProvider helps a bit. 

In an additional note Flickering/Flashing seems to be quite a general problem 
in XP.

JRT.
The files were extracted outside eclipse, into org.eclipse.ui (no subfolders).
Then I did a refresh.  However, the delete was done from within Eclipse.
Jennifer, turning off redraw in postAdd and postRemove is not the correct fix. 
This means that even when a single element is added the full widget is redrawn. 

We need to understand why non-Java files behave differently than Java files. 
For changes to Java files a delta with many changes results in a refresh from 
the parent node containing the changes. Non-Java resources should behave in the 
same way.
There were two problems resulting in more than one refresh
- Java and resource change could force at least one refresh which could result
in two or more refresh calls.
- the outer most loop on resource deltas did not test how many changes the delta
contained
