Eclipse 2.1RC1, Windows 2000
Consider the following code:

public void test()
{
   callMethod(paramA, paramB, <cursor>"paramC", paramD);
}

when you press Enter at the <cursor> position, editing continues at the 
beginning of the next line rather than the correct indenting position. Pressing 
Enter every other place produces the expected behaviour (it seems that the 
problem only occurs when " is the next character).

This is similar as described in bug 31386, however I don't know whether it is a 
duplicate.

As of the 200401210900 I-build and using the new formatter it seems to be fixed.

Yes, thanks - fixed a while ago.
