Build: I-20050201

Open any Java file that contains > 1 import statements.

Let's say the first import statement reads:
import org.eclipse.core.runtime.*;

delete the '*;' from the end and try to use code assist to insert 
IRunnableWithProgress for example.

You will see that upon pressing Enter to select, the text gets inserted 
several lines down under all the import statements.
the cursor is now in a random position also.

Can be reproduced. Looks like auto-import and code assist get into a conflict here.

Martin, did you do any changes in that area?
