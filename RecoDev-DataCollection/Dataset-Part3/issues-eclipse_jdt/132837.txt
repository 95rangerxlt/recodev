The APT doc should be under the Java Development User Guide instead of being a standalone entry in the help system.

Done.  

But on a smaller scale, the APT API should be included along with the rest of the JDT APIs rather than as a separate topic in the JDT Reference; so let's pretend that's what this bug is talking about and keep it open till I fix that.
Looks like for now, since the javadoc run for APT has to be Java 5.0 compatible while the run for JDT is 1.4 compatible, we need to keep these topics separate (though both are contained within the JDT Plug-in Developer Guide, Reference).  But otherwise I think as of N20060410 everything is in order and as closely integrated as it should be.  Resolving as "fixed".
