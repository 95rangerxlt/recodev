Using build 2002-01-09 on Windows 2000

From the prefrerence dialog, I opened the page Java > Classpath Variables. I 
selected the ECLIPSE_HOME variable and pressed Edit. The content came up as
   ECLIPSE_HOME
   D:/eclipse-sdk/2001-12-04/eclipse
I started editing the path by removing the 2001-12-04 section
   D:/eclipse-sdk//eclipse
At that point I got the following red error message at the bottom of the dialog
   !VariableCreationDialogerror.invalidpath!
