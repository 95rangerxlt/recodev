Build 20020418

While fixing the indent problem for extract method I did a search for \t in JDT 
UI. The following classes are IMO suspicious regarding their usage of \t

JavaAutoIndentStrategy.java

NLSLine.java
NLSRefactoring.java

StubUtility.java

SurroundWithTryCatchRefactoring.java

Changed JavaAutoIndentStrategy to use CodeFormatterUtil > 20020430
The strategy of JavaAutoIndentStrategy is to always copy the indent from the 
current line. Only after a { the indent has to be increased, then the method in 
CodeFormatterUtil is used.

StubUtility requires users to reformat the generated code.

Moving to Adam for NLS
NLSLine is ok - \t is in toString method
fixed NLSRefactoring

bounce to Dirk (is SurroundWithTryCatchRefactoring done?)
Surround With Try/Cacth refactoring is fixed.
