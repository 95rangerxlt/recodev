Build 2.1 RC1

1. Open TestCase
2. In editor select method declaration "getName"
3. Refactor->Inline...
4. Check "Delete..."
5. Press "Preview"
6. Expand all
==> the nodes "getName" and "Delete method declaration" don't have a preview
while other nodes like "Inline invocation" (below) have one. I would expect to
see the method source on the left side when selecting "getName" or "Delete
method declaration".
