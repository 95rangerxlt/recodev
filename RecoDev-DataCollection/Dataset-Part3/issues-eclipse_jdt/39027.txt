When editing the "active working set" closed projects cannot be removed from 
the working set, the project has to be opened so it can be removed. This is a

Are you refering to Java working sets?
This works for resource working sets.
The Java working set edit page does not show closed projects which causes this 
problem.
Yes, Java working sets. In the Package Explorer closed projects show up but, 
like you say, in the edit active working set window the closed projects do not. 
This means that to remove a closed Java project from a Java working-set I have 
to open it first. Of course this is a really minor thing, but it seems counter-
intuative to me.

I didn't realise that the Java working-set editor was different to the resource 
working-set editor, should have looked more carefully I suppose ;-)

Java working set edit page problem.
Daniel, can you please have a look.
The Java working set page did not get adapted to the fact that closed project
appear in the UI. Before the were not visible in the Package Explorer and the
Navigator.
