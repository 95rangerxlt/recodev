When the "Link with Editor" option is enabled in the outline view, placing the
cursor inside a method will open this method's outline. While this is useful for
overall editing, it would be nice if it did not do so on import statements. This
list is potentially long and an outline does not always reveal any more sensible
information.
Either an exclusion from the tree-open or another option to hide imports
completely in the outline view (like e.g. for static members) should be added.

We will not do this for 3.0. As we will introduce folded code in 3.0, the 
problem will also loose importance.

Fixed.
