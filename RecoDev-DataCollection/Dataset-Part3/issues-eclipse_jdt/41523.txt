When I edit a library in the Properties dialog of my project using
"Properties"->"Java Build Path"->"Libraries"->"Edit", e.g. changing the JRE from
1.4 to 1.3, or changing from an old version of a JAR to a newer one, the changed
library is at the last position in the classpath. It should kept at the position
it was.
