If you open the code formatter preference page and expand the dialog, the part 
with the code only takes up half of the dialog. In fact it should take up all 
of the remaining space that the tab pane doesnt need. IE: the GridData on the 
tab pane should be FILL_HORIZONTAL and not FILL_BOTH and the GridData on the 
code example should be FILL_BOTH.

A plugin for viewing system properties and settign custom properties. 

This plugin demonstrates the problem. The icon for the plugin is a PNG. You can
see that it works in the view and preference page but not in the dialogs where
you select open-view.
Silvio, please make sure that the new dialog doesn't reveal the same behaviour.
Fixed in the new page (Java -> Work in progress -> Enable new formatter)
