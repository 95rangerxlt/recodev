build N1206 on Win2K, IBM VM 1.3.1 

in the big workspace I started up, opened the java perspective and navigated to 
org.eclipse.core.resources/src.  When I clicked to expand the src folder my CPU 
went to 100% for alone time (forever?).  Using ctrl-break I got the attached 
core dump which indicates that the RenameSupport.create() method appears to be 
called infinitely.  Note that memory use does not seem to be increasing.
