As part of commit http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=847d6f142c88b0ccb99f3e6bd6cd121ab95489d8 the following warning got enabled in all our projects

org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.missingDefaultCase=warning

Now there are 166 warnings in o.e.jdt.ui alone under "Potential programming problems' category => I find this a bit annoying.

- Do we try to fix them all? I would think this is a bit tedious...
- Or do we simply turn off the warning? I would go with this option since we can always enable the diagnostic temporarily if we are trying to find a concrete problem.

I checked all the 22 "The switch over the type X should have a default case" warnings in org.eclipse.jdt.ui, and all of them are false positives.

We could add an empty "default:" clause everywhere, but I think that's overkill. It would be like stipulating that every "if" also needs an empty "else" branch.

Only 22? I see 166.

In some places a default clause can be handy e.g. in situations similar to 
ArrayType.java	line 110, i.e. 'return false' can possibly be moved to default to improve readability. But as I said it is tedious to go over all the warnings and try and tweak stuff for not much gain...

OK, after a clean/rebuild, I see 175. Bug 46780 is hurting us here.

> In some places a default clause can be handy
Yes, and in all other places it impedes code readability.

E.g. in ArrayType#doCanAssignTo(TType), it was a deliberate decision to list all cases explicitly. This makes it easier to compare it with other implementations of this method. And the default would not help for anything (not for coping with a new kind and not for finding code that needs to be updated if another kind got added).
Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=940468a6f25d98b370eb9e625a70bc543265c146
