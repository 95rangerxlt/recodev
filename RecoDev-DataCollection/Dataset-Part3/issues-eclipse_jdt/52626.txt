Edit the template for "public method", for example, and replace the space
between the return type and the method name with a <newline>. When you use
the template, it generates the correct code but when you tab from the return
type to the method name, it is off by one character so you can't just retype
the name. This occurs on Windows so it probably has something to do with the
stupid "\r\n" newline code.

Moving to JDT UI for comments.
Also reproducable on Linux-GTK (only when Java->Editor->Template->"Use Code
Formatter" is unchecked).
appears to be fixed > 20060120 - please reopen if you disagree.
