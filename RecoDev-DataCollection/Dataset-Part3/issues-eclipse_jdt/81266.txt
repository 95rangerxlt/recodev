When in the 'Show working sets' mode, you still have the action 'Show working
copy...'. It opens a dialog 'Configure working sets'. Double clicking an entry
select a working copy node.

Wouldn't it be better to rename it to 'Configure working sets' (only when in the
working copy mode) and drop the selection behaviour?

I'm mixing mode and sets. Should always be 'sets'
Wrong: I'm mixing 'copy' and sets. Should always be 'sets'
Fixed.
