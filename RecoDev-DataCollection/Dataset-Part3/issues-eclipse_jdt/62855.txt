I use Eclipse 3.M08.
I press Ctrl + Shift + Space and the editor shows the Methode-Paramters.
If I use this function with a Two-Monitor-System (Laptop-Screen + Monitor-
Screen) and the cursor is near by the editors-border, the tooltip shows only 
the first-parameter and clip the rest paramters.
If you can't imagine the problem i can send you a screenshot.

Cheers...
