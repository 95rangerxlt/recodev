Had to disable reconcile-time APT dispatch on the petstore demo fro java one 
because perf was so bad.  Someone needs to profile this.  

Repro:

1.  setup petstore projects (see below)
2.  edit file in petstore project
3.  wait (and wait and wait...) for reconcile.


Setup Instructions for Beehive Petstore Demo 
--------------------------------------------

1.  WTP-enable your eclipse installation.  You'll need to drop the following 
plugins into your eclipse\plugins directory.  
	
	6/17 I-build of WTP - 
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drops/I-I20050617-
200506171814/wtp-I20050617.zip
	6/9 build of EMF    - 
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drivers/emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-
I200506091102.zip
	RC1 of GEF 3.1      - 
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drivers/GEF-SDK-3.1RC1.zip
	JME 1.1 M2          - 
http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drivers/JEM-SDK-1.1M2.zip
 
2.  Get the org.eclipse.beehive and org.eclipse.beehive.zip & 
org.eclipse.beehive.ide.eclipse.core.zip plugins from the file share, and 
exppand them onto your hard-drive
3.  Import these projects into your workspace that contains the apt projects
4.  Launch a debug instance of eclipse from this workspace.
5.  Get the J1Petstore.zip and JDBCControlSample.zip files from the file 
share, and extract them onto your filesystem.
6.  Import these projects into your debug workspace.
7.  Beehive-enable your projects, for J1Petstore and JDBCControlSample 
	a) right-click the project, and then choose Add/Remove Beehive support
	b) open the .project file and make sure that the beehive builder has 
been removed
	c) right-click the project and then choose Add/Remove Beehive support 
again
	d) got to "Project | Properties | Java Annotaiton Processing ", and 
then choose the "apply" button, and then choose the "OK" button. (this will 
cause the options to be persisted)

7.  Do a clean build of the J1Petstore project (note the many bugs and crappy 
performance)
8.  Do a clean build of the JDBCControlSample project (note the many bugs and 
crappy performance)

Note that the JDBCControlSample project is a smaller project, and builds more 
quickly than J1Petstore project.

Also note that there are some nasty bugs here.  You may need to disable the 
reconcile-time apt dispatch (see APTDispatch.java), and disable the resource & 
model listeners (see the GeneratedFileManager's init() method)

Use of Package.getClasses() in the default package was causing all the trouble.
Fixed that, and perf problems seemed to go away. Reconcile now works reasonably
quickly.
