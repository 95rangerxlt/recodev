When the "sort" option if off in the outline view, the view should sort according to source 
order,  right? If I recall correctly, it always did that for me until RC2. Now all of a sudden 
when I add fields for example, they are added at the end in the outline view.

works for me please provide reproducable steps.
Moving to JDT-Text
Ok, this does the 'trick' for me:

1) Choose the Java perspective and set all views to 'fast view' except the outline view
2) Set the outline view to non-sorting, show fields, show statics, show non-public
3) Create a new class named "Test" (default package, no methods, no superclass, just empty)
4) Save it (probably not necessary?)
5) Give the file the following contents:

public class Test {
    public static final String CONSTANT="constant";
    
    private int var1;
    private int var2;
    
    public int getVar1() {
        return var1;
    }
}

Wow, part of my comment got clipped! Ok, here's the rest again:

After step 5, the outline view lists:

Test
      CONSTANT : String
      var1 : int
      var2 : int
      getVar1()

6) Now add private int var3 on the empty line between the declaration of var2 and getVar1():

public class Test {
    public static final String CONSTANT="constant";
    
    private int var1;
    private int var2;
    private int var3;
    public int getVar1() {
        return var1;
    }
}

The outline view is updated and lists:

Test
      CONSTANT : String
      var1 : int
      var2 : int
      getVar1()
      var3 : int

Clearly, this is not source order.

I hope this helps!
Works for me using 3.0 M2.
