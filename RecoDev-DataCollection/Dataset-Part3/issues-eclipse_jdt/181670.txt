3.3 M6

The "Java Search" tab (off the primary Search dialog) has many types of search contexts ("Search In"), such as JRE, Application Libaries, etc.  

The F1 help from the dialog does not describe these; it does not have a "Search In" section.  As a result for example someone can't determine what exactly we mean by "Application Libraries".  At least, not that I can see.
