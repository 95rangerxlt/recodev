'Find Strings To Externalize...' and 'Externalize Strings...' are doing basically the same thing. There should be only one action called 'Externalize Strings...' enabled on projects, packages, CUs, and types, which delegates to the appropriate action. The attached patch is doing this. See also Bug 135285. 

Following API change is required:

make
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.IJavaEditorActionDefinitionIds.FIND_STRINGS_TO_EXTERNALIZE
deprecated with message 'Use EXTERNALIZE_STRINGS'

and make
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.JdtActionConstants.FIND_STRINGS_TO_EXTERNALIZE
deprecated with message 'Use EXTERNALIZE_STRINGS'
