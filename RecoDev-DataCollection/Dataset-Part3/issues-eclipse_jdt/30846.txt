build I20030115

- maximize the eclipse window
- open a large CU
- zoom it
- position the caret in the first line of text
- scroll it up 20 lines or so
- Ctrl+O
- the outline prompter is cut off by the top of the screen

There are similar issues when the caret is scrolled off the bottom, but it 
seems to check for the bottom of the screen.

Could just position the prompter below the first visible line if the caret is 
not visible.
