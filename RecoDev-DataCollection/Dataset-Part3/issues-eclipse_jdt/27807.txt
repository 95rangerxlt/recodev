PDE has two places (plug-ins view and classpath container page) where our label 
provider needs to render classpath entries.

An easy solution would be to add 'library' and 'library with source' images to 
the list of shared images currently supported by JavaUI.getSharedImages() 
(currently, the closes image is JAR but we cannot render entry with source 
attachment).

An ideal solution would be a label provider similar to JavaElementLabelProvider 
that can render classpath entries.

Either one works for us. Exposing the two images is less work.

Martin, do we have a label provider that renders class path entries that we can 
make API ?
Martin, can you please comment on this.
I think best is if the images would be added as shared images.

Dejan, do you need icons for internal or external Jars.
External. These are for PDE 'Plugins' view that shows external plug-ins with in 
a similar way as projects in the workspace. When select plug-ins are added to 
the Java model, their JAR files change icons into external JARs with or without 
source and you can drill into the packages and types.
