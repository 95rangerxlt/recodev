I made a change in the SynchronizationContentProvider that allows the AbstractRefactoringSynchronizationContentProvider to be cleaned up a bit *I will attach a patch). The change involves how a listener gets registered (i.e. it is now done byu the superclass) so there is no change in behavior associated with this fix. It is strickly code hygien.
