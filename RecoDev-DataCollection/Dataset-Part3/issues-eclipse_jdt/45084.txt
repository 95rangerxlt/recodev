Instead of choosing a JDK to use (when multiple JDKs are on the system) at the 
workbench level, the JDK should be chosen on a project level. This allows 
developers to build and run with 1.3.1 for some projects and 1.4.2 for other 
projects. Right now the user would have to switch JDKs in the preferences to 
compile another project.

Note: This is reported on M4.
You can do it at the project level: Project->Properties->Build Path->Libraries-
>JRE System Library->Edit->Alternate JRE

OK to close?
Ok. Thanks. Perhaps change the bug to documentation issue since this isnt well 
documented to my knowledge. (I did look quite a bit).
Old bug that has been fixed and never closed
