- 'Shift': is used for selection too
  -> navigating by holding Shift and clicking on an element results in selection
first and then navigation to *the selection*
  -> selecting text by holding Shift and clicking with the mouse results in
'Current text selection doesn't resolve to a Java element' in the status bar
- 'None': is used for navigation too
  -> navigating in the text by clicking with the mouse results in 'Current text
selection doesn't resolve to a Java element' in the status bar

We should prohibit the Shift as modifier if we don't find a way to switch of 
the Shift selection on the widget.
SHIFT is a problem in all modes
- will disable
NONE is usless unless we stop the BEEP and the status line
- fill do so

Disabled SHIFT as part of the modifier.

Also fixed initialization bug on preference page: text was enabled when checkbox
wasn't selected.

The NONE-problem is there because we use the standard OpenAction which does the
beep and the status line printing. We can either
1) check before checking off the action
2) create our own action (which silently ignores errors)
3) disable NONE

I vote for 1)
1) should read "check if it is OK to run the action"

Added a cool fix which also reduces noise in all other cases.
