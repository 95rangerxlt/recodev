This can be rather annoying, e.g. the Javadoc of Object#getClass() is rendered like this:
"[..] The result is of type Class where X is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which getClass is called."

Correct would be:
"[..] The result is of type Class<? extends X> where X is the erasure [..]".

Fix

Here's a patch with test.

To conform to the exisiting code, I wrote "@literal" etc. as manifest string, although I would recommend using TagElement.TAG_LITERAL et al.
Last nitpicking: there's a typo in subsituteQualification().
                                       ^ insert t
Thanks! Released the patch and adaptions according to comment 2 > 20060724.
