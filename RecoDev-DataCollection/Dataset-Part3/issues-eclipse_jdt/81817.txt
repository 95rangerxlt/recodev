Sonia,

yes the test should be there. Since we are using the same test.xml & test cases
for Linux and Windows I don't see how we can cause this. Can you shed some light
on it ?
There is an NPE when this particular scenario runs on Linux:

0010/performance/html/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.refactoring_linux.gtk.perf.html
Sonia,

the only obvious scenario that can produce a NPE here is that the testResources
directory didn't get checked out correctly. Sonia, when you run the performance
tests is there a file

org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests/testresources/org.eclipse.swt-R3_0.zip

The jdt.text.tests use exactly the same mechanism to access the swt file and
there tests run under Linux.
This file exists.
Fixed. Problem was that Linux file system is case sensitive.

Backported fix to 2.1.3, 3.0 and 3.0.1 performance branch.
