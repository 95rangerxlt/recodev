Build: 2.1 RC3a

1) Create a java file, A.java:

public class A {
}

2) In the java editor, change the class name to "Com1".

3) The word "Com1" will be underlined because it doesn't match the compilation
unit name.  Select the name and invoke quick fix.

4) Choose the quick fix option, "Rename the compilation unit to Com1.java"

-> Nothing happens.

The log file contains several stack traces

Expectation: The error should be reported to the user, not to the log (since
it's a user error, not a program failure).

Not critical enough for 2.1. Usually people don't use CU names like Com1.

2.1 Readme
Not critical enough for readme
John, note that we still would like to have a method 'canCreate', see bug 6998.
We have no exceptions throws by user errors, but like to prevent exceptions.
exceptions thrown in changes are now surfaced.

The rename CU quick fix now only appears for valid CU names
