1. In a default text editor type in the following:

<space><tab>some text
<tab>some text

2. Now highlight the two lines above and execute Shift-Left.  Notice that 
nothing moves.  
3. Replace the tab character in the first line with spaces so that the two 
lines are indented the same visually.  Execute Shift-Left.  The text now moves.

I'm not sure how this is spec'd, but in the first scenario it seems like the 
second line should be shifted left and the first line should be shifted left at 
least to the space character (i.e., get rid of the tab).  At any rate, it's 
definitely confusing if there is a stray space.  You don't know why the text 
won't shift.
