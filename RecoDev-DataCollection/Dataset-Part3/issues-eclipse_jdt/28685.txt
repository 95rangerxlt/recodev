Yes, that's a real problem. I'll have to think about the Mac 'right mouse button emulated 
via control-click' issues...
Just curious: are you using a two/three-button mouse or are you emulating the right click 
via the control-modifier?
Depends. When using the notebook I usually don't attach a mouse, so it's ctrl-click. On 
the non-portable system, I use a three button mouse.

In M5 you are able to change the modifiers on the pref page.
So this problem has been addressed. However, the default value is 'Control' on all 
platforms, but it should be 'Command' on MacOS X.
I've entered bug #31249 for this issue.
