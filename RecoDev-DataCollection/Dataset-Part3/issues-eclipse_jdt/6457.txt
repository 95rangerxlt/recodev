The project location is now d:\workspaces\test (my default location)

It is even worse. In build 20020109 the packages view shows the *old* project. 
Additionally the location is changed as described in this PR (use the Navigator 
to check since the project isn't present in the packages view)
projects should be renamed using descriptions - see RenameResourceAction in 
eclipse.ui (method invokeOperation)
we must do the same
fixed for build 20020116
