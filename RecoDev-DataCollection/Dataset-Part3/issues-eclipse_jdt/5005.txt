-import the attached StyledText.java
-select the methods doBidiSelectionCursorNext and doBidiSelectionCursorPrevious 
in the outline view and delete them using the context menu
->the delete operation affects text that is nowhere near the deleted methods!
One of the print methods has a / removed and a few lines are no longer indented 
(e.g., "boolean bidiColoring = false").

Test case StyledText.java
Don't see this behavior in build 20011025.

The description probably indicates a JavaModel problem.
The delete action in the outliner only executes ISourceManipulation.delete. The 
delete of a method in a compilation unit's working copy causes a 
BufferChangeEvent which is a replace of the whole buffer content. Thus, even if 
the action would call delete on the wrong ISourceManipulation, the described 
corruptions must not occur.
Appears to be fixed in 20011025.
See previous comment.
