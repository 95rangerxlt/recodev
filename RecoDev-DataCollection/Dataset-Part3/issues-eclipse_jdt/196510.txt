Build ID: I20070625-1500

Steps To Reproduce:
In a method like this:

boolean foo (int i) {
    while (i < 100)
        if (i == 42)
            return true;
        else
            i = i + 3;
    return false;       
}

...Eclipse 3.3 displays a warning on the line "i = i + 3;", saying "Statement unnecessarily nested within else clause. The corresponding then clause does not complete normally" and shows a Quick Fix icon - but does not offer a quick fix.


More information:
When the if statement is nested inside another control statement, it is not possible to turn the else part into a separate statement, unless you introduce a block around the if statement.
I cannot find an option in Preferences to suppress this warning.

So, a couple of bugs:
1) Warning on a reasonable and common construct
2) Quick fix icon with no quick fix
3) No way to suppress warning

The warning is valid.
You can write your code this way:
boolean foo (int i) {
    while (i < 100) {
        if (i == 42)
            return true;
        i = i + 3;
    }
    return false;       
}

This is what the warning meant. The else clause is not required in this case.
Moving to JDT/UI for find out why the quick fix doesn't propose anything.
Updating title accordingly.
I would prefer to use this pattern and to suppress the warning in Eclipse, but I could not find an option in the Java preferences to suppress it. Is there one? Or can it be suppressed with an annotation?

If not, I consider that a bug.

This Quick Fix would also make sense as Clean Up I think.

fixed > 200707016. You now get a quick fix.
