The JavaSynchronizationContentProvider sometimes returns a null element. As a result of this, I sometimes get NPEs from StructuredViewer wheb expanding Java packages. I believe the problem is that JavaCore.create(members[index]) is used in a few places to get members but that can return null. The returned value should be checked for null before it is added to the result.
