I attempted to externalize a string "my little string" to pderesources.properties.  

I make the required changes in the externalize wizard such that I get 
PDEPlugin.getResourceString("MYCLASS.littleString"); in the place of the string
above (GREAT!).  However, I look in my properties file and nothing's changed. 
Comparing with head shows that it's the exact same as before.

Shouldn't the wizard put something to the effect of "MYCLASS.littleString = my
little string" in the properties file?

Let me know if I'm misunderstanding the wizard here? :)

Thanks!

Cherie, which build are you using and do you have anything in the log file. 
Additionally does the preview show the modified properties file ?

This works for me without any problems using I20040514_0800
Hi Dirk!

I'm using the same build but unfortunately am not receiving the same results. 
The preview indicates my log file has changes but does not display any.

I'll attach a screenshot with what I see :)
Created attachment 10720
externalize wizard preview

Note that there is not '+' expansion option for pderesources.properties and
there the up/down arrows to traverse through changes are disabled.

Thanks!
Cherie, thanks for the screen shot, but do you have steps to reproduce. As 
said I am not able to do so. How big is your workspace. Can you zip it and 
attach it to the bug report.
Hi Dirk,

Apparently, the properties file was wrapping lines using "\" to wrap lines which
the wizard wasn't as appreciative of. The problem was found and Martin released
a fix for it over the last day or so.   It was working for me nicely last night :)

Thanks!
