More information:
The code compiles. We would need new preferences which would then be honored by the AST rewrite.
Daniel: Here are the error messages

The import java.util.Timer conflicts with a type defined in the same file	Timer.java	foo/src/mypackage	line 3	Java Problem
Type mismatch: cannot convert from Timer to Timer	Timer.java	foo/src/mypackage	line 7	Java Problem

Right, comment 1 (The code compiles.) was wrong.
We should use an ImportRewriteContext here.
Fixed in HEAD of AssignToVariableAssistProposal.
