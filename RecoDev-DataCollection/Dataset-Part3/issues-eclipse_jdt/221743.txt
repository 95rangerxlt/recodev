3.4M5 on RHEL5 with a fresh workspace

The text for "Configure the formatter settings on the Formatter page" is wrapped but there's not enough vertical space for the second line.  Resizing the dialog doesn't cause the layout to update.

fix

I can not reproduce this on gtk. But it is possible that this patch can fix it.

Nitin? Do you see strange layouts anywhere else? Is it only this page? It's also very strange, that 'Configure Project Specific Settings...' is cropped, although there seams to be enough space. Maybe a SWT bug.

Can you verify the fix in a upcomming nightly-build please?

Fixed unless we hear otherwise.
