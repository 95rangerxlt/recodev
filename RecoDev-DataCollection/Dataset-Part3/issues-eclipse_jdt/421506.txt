Setting

I think most Eclipse projects (at least Eclipse platform, EGit and e4) ask their contributors to remove trailing whitespace from their contributions.

I suggest to add "Remove trailing white space on all lines" to the default Additional save actions. 

I also think that "Use modifier final where possible" for private fields is currently not desired by the Eclipse projects. 

This would result in setting similar to the attached screenshot.

Would JDT accept a patch for this change?

That would be wrong from their part then. If they want this, then they have to set this on their project(s) and all committers and contributors will get the correct settings independent of whatever they currently have as workspace setting.
Thanks Dani, I was not aware that we can configure the save actions plug-ins specific.
Dani, thanks again for the tip. I started to enable the save settings for the platform plug-ins.

Can we maybe still adjust the defaults? 

I guess "Remove trailing whitespace" is a question of taste, if you don't like it, I accept that of course.

But I would like to remove the "Use modifier final where possible for private fields" default. IMHO this is a setting which is not used by Eclipse and Android code or covered by the Java code conventions (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-141270.html#2991).

Clean Up defaults also don't add 'final', so,
fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=21be8823a48717061920710aa706a4406679f641

Thanks Dani!
