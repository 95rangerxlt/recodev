1. Create a new Java project jp1 and switch to Java perspective.
2. Create a package p1 under jp1.
3. Create a new Java project jp2.
4. Create a package p2 under jp2.
5. Create a new class C1 under p1.
6. Dirty the C1.java file by entering some comments.
7. Without saving C1.java, in Package Explorer, delete jp1.
8. In the Confirm Project Delete dialog, choose "Also delete contents 
under '[Your workspace path]\jp1', and click Yes.
9. Observe that the C1.java editor is still opened with a dirty sign '*'. 
Close this editor by clicking the 'X' sign.
10. In the Save Resource dialog, choose Yes.
11. In the Save As window, select jp2/p2 as the parent folder. Click OK.
12. Notice that a File Deleted dialog appears, it asks "The file has been 
deleted from the file system. Do you want to save your changes or close the 
editor without saving?". <-- problem.
13. Click Save, the dialog disappears, doing nothing.

Actually before step 12, the file has been saved to the file system. So the 
dialog in step 12 is redundant. 

This problem only happens in Windows, I tried on SuSE Linux, didn't see that 
extra dialog.

Move to JDT/UI
- which builds do you use on those two machines?
- are the same preference used (especially General > Workspace > Refresh
automatically)?
(In reply to comment #2)

The build I used was EClipse 3.0.2 200503110845.

I've tried turning on Workbench -> Refresh workspace automatically, in each 
platform. But the behaviour in Windows and Linux were different. So this 
setting is not the cause.

Please try on this specific EClipse build (200503110845), IBM's Rational 
Software Architect 6.0.1 is based on it.
This has been fixed in 3.1.
