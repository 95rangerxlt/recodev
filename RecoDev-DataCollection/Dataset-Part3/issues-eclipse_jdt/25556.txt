Eclipse 20021028

When enterring a string, if I forget to start with a ", and then attempt to 
add it after completing my string code assist insists on putting "", and not 
allowing me to delete one of the two.  I have tried surrounding my string 
by "" on both sides, and then deleteing one ", but no luck.  The only way to 
get my string within " was to cut and paste the string.
