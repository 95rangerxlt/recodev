Agreed. Here's the code from MembersFilter (using this class directly seems overkill here):

MemberFilter.select(Viewer, Object, Object):
if (element instanceof IMember) {
	IMember member= (IMember) element;
	int memberType= member.getElementType();
	if (member.getElementName().startsWith("<")) { //$NON-NLS-1$
		// filter out <clinit>
		return false;
	}
}

Not critical for M6. Will address if we have nothing else to do.

Sorry, minor and no time, it's also a bigger change (I don't want to filter the breadcrumb, only the drop downs, due to performance reasons)
