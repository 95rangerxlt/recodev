Investigation issue.
The text manipulation is the responsibility of the computed completion 
proposals. The behave differently depending on preferences and dynamically 
switchable states (such as Ctrl for toggling between eating/non-eating). In 
order to get a complete solution in presence of already existing 
implementations of completion proposals the original selection should be 
remembered as a position. The completion proposal should be applied but its 
selection not yet set but also be remembered as a position. The original 
selection as described by the updated position should be removed, and then the 
new selection as described by its position should be set.

Removing milestone as we will not have a waterproof implementation for RC1. 
RC2 candidate.
Closing. This works for a while already.
