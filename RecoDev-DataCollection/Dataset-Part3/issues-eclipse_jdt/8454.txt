In the Java Type Hierarchy perspective, "focus on" a class using the Hierarchy 
view. Select the class in that view and notice the status line is updated. Now 
click on another non-eclipse window. Assuming you can still see the Eclipse 
window, notice the status line is empty now. If you try this using the nav 
view, the status line does not go away.
