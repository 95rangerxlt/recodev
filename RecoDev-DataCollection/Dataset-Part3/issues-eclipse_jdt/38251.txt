I had the following code:

if (plugin == null)  // junit is not installed
   log();

wanted to add a block and inserted "{" after null)
-> it got inserted at the end of the line:
if (plugin == null)  // junit is not installed{ <<<<<

When there is an end of line comment then the brace
has to be inserted in front of the comment.
