Build Identifier: M20110825-0847

When overriding a method from a superclass which has got a generic varargs argument, code completion adds a wrong method declaration. 

Expected:
- the following method declaration should be added
 @Override
 void method(Z<?>... zs) {
   // TODO Auto-generated method stub
   super.method(zs);
 }

Actual:
- "transient" modifier is added
- varargs argument is changed to array
- outer class name ("Testcase") is added
- the complete method declaration looks like follows
 transient void method(Testcase.Z<?>[] zs) {};

Environment:
- Eclipse 3.7.1 (M20110825-0847)
- JDK 7

---
class Testcase {
    static interface Z<T> {}

    static class A {
        void method(Z<?>... zs) {}
    }

    static class B extends A {
        // - type here `method` and then use code completion (ctrl + space)
    }
}
---

Reproducible: Always

Seems broken since pre-3.7 times. Will investigate

Proposing a patch for this bug

This proposed fix is to preserve argument type. Eclipse is dropping everything that comes after '<' while comparing arguments. 

extension/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/corext/dom/Bindings.java isEqualMethod is dropping stuff that comes after <> for argument comparison. It makes sense to drop the generic arguments but eclipse should preserve stuff that comes after generic arguments; such as an array. 

e.g. while comparing arguments Z<?>[] and Z, if everything after < is dropped Z<?>[] and Z will become equal which is not true.
Deepak, can you please take a look at the above patch(which is against JDT/Text) and see if it solves the problem? If so, we can move it to JDT text for a review. Thanks!

Looks reasonable. I will take a look. (Have to make sure that other clients are not adversely affected)

Thanks for the patch, Samrat! 

I tweaked the patch a bit and added a few tests.
