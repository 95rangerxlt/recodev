I refactored my testcases to use some abstract classes.  When I now recreate 
the testsuite (BTW, this only works in the Java but not in the Java-Browsing 
perspective), the abstract classes are added.  I'm using M5.

Is this a JUnit artifact ?
Since an abstract TestCase class can also contribute test cases this is the 
correct behaviour. 

The action is currently only available on CompilationUnits and therefore 
doesn't work on Types in the JavaBrowsing perspective.
Create the following class:

----
import junit.framework.TestCase;


public abstract class AbstractTestCase extends TestCase {

  public void testFoo() throws Exception {
    assertTrue("works", true);
  }

}
----

Use the TestSuite wizard for the package - it creates a testsuite including the 
abstract class. Run the testsuite - you get a warning "cannot instantiate 
testcase" (which is totally sensible, as abstract classes can't be 
instantiated).

Therefore, please reopen the bug. (And change the summary again...)
You are absolutly correct... 

Abstract classes should not be included in the test suite.
