Two features in JDT have obsolete "legal files" in them. 

org.eclipse.jdt-feature in eclipse.jdt repo

epl-v10.html
notice.html


Appears this "jdt.jeview.feature" is a "nested" feature? 
And, it appears it is no longer used? (or, at least not actively). 
If so, I'd recommend just removing it from "master" (in addition to deleting those to obsolete files.

For org.eclipse.jdt-feature, if when it's two obsolete legal files are removed, then the build.properties file needs to be updated too, to remove the "root=rootfiles", or else the build will fail. 

For org.eclipse.jdt.jeview.feature, it does not have "root=rootfiles", but it does list the files to be "exported" in bin and source distributions, which should be removed, for cleanliness.

I don't think so. What makes you think so?

It is used whenever we (manually) build a new version of our Java Element view utility. See https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/#optional

I think we can remove them, but instead we have to refer to the license plug-in in the feature.xml:
      license-feature="org.eclipse.license"
      license-feature-version="0.0.0">

I don't recall what made me think/say that ... I see nothing now, except that from "SDK point of view" it is not used, but that' next topic.

Ok, thanks for the pointer. (If any interest, we could "build it" and "put in our repository" as we now do with "swt tools" ... but, that'd be a new bug/enhancement ... just FYI.

Yes. Most "occurrences" I found of these old files were already using shared license. Probably did not look at this very much, thinking it wasn't used at all. 

Thanks again, for the "education".

How did you find this? I ask because there's also org.eclipse.jdt.astview.feature in the same repo.

Fixed both with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=24a5c058e1a60a87a5e8605a57252f61dad7b119

and reverted the deletion of the license element
- <license url="%licenseURL">
- %license
- </license>
with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=12844ffe9e42695727f2c155ba906438ba6ffe7b

Don't recall, and not saying I've "caught" them all. 
But, typically I have "everything" in my workspace, 
and often use "Open Resource..." to find resources by name, once I'd noticed some of the obvious ones in eclipse.platform.releng. And, occasionally, I search through the actual "build area" on build machine (with find, or grep) but dont' recall in this case. 

I do not I focused on "ept-v10.html" and know there are some cases where where is a lone "notice.html" or "license.html" ... and ... don't recall if I even noted all those. (There's *so* much junk in our repos :) it's hard to catch it all!)

Thanks for the offer. For now we can leave it as is. It doesn't change that often.
Produced ASTView 1.1.10 and JE View 1.0.10, and fixed the shared license generation: For the latter to work, the feature must contain a feature.properties (can be empty), and that file must be included in build.properties.

The presence of
   <license url="%licenseURL">
      %license
   </license>
in feature.xml is optional -- if it's not there, it gets added during the build (with bad formatting, of course).
