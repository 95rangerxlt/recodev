Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Templates

select a template, and then click edit.
change the name in the name field, click OK.

You get a dialog that says "The name of the template has been changed." but with
a yes/no query.  

This doesn't make sense.  The behavior is also quite instesting if you say yes
then it duplicates the old one, if you no it does not duplicate the old one.

rename template dialog
Yes/No dialog is OK but the message was not. It is now:

The name of the template has been changed. Click 'Yes' to create an additional
template with the new name or 'No' to rename the existing one.
