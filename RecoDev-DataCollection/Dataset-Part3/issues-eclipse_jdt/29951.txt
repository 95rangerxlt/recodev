- invoke Quick Fix 'rename' on a variable
- move cursor to the end of the template region, like:
    int test|= 123;
    test= 321;
  (where '|' indicates the cursor, not a real character)
- press delete, results in:
    int test| 123;
    test 321;
       ^^The '=' is gone.

I can't reproduce this on eclipse 4.5, this might have been fixed in the meantime. Can anyone confirm this bug as being fixed?
Cannot reproduce with Eclipse 4.5.N20150323-2000. Closing as Fixed.
