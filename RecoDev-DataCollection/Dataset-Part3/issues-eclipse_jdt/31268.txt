Could not find existing PR for it, but this is still an issue.
Open fresh hierarchy on 'Exception', it will take some time during which user 
has no indication about what's going on.

We are showing a busy cursor, but it isn't visible (see 6325). We tried using a 
progress monitor but it causes some rework of the viewer when creating the tree 
items, which now take 30% of the time. And it looked strange to not see a 
progress monitor during this time.

Time permitted for 2.1 
In 2.1 world, since indexes are no longer checked for consistency eagerly 
during startup, search actions may trigger lazily some indexing work 
(rebuilding a big index will take some decent amount of time).

Thus, opening a type hierarchy can enter this mode, and user gets absolutely no 
feedback whatsoever, it feels the IDE froze.
Got addressed for RC1
