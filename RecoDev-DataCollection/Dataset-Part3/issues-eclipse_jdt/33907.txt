This is with the "Insert completion" code assist preference turned off.

1) Start with the following type:

public class A {
	public void foo() {
		String s = "hello";
		s.startsWith("");
	}
}

2) Position the cursor between "s" and "t" in the startsWith method call
3) Invoke code assist

Observe: the remainder of the method "tartsWith" is highlighted.  This is fine.

4) Single left click on the method "substring" in the completion list
5) Now single left click outside the code assit popup to cancel it.

Observe: the remainder of the method is still highlighted, even though code
assist has been canceled.

The only way to get rid of the highlighting is to close and reopen the editor,
or type inside the highlighted area.
