Following a debate about the value of COMPILER_PB_UNUSED_DECLARED_THROWN_EXCEPTION_INCLUDE_UNCHECKED_EXCEPTIONS, bug 219461 was opened to replace that option with semantics that were closer to the original user expectations and that gathered support from more people, which resulted into option COMPILER_PB_UNUSED_DECLARED_THROWN_EXCEPTION_EXEMPT_EXCEPTION_AND_THROWABLE. Since COMPILER_PB_UNUSED_DECLARED_THROWN_EXCEPTION_INCLUDE_UNCHECKED_EXCEPTIONS was introduced in 3.4 M5, we'd rather get rid of it than carry it too long as deprecated. I agreed with Martin that I would still leave it a deprecated for a while, but I'd like to remove it in M6 cycle. UI integrated the to-be-removed option with bug 216233. Note that I reopened bug 219461 to take care of the to-be-removed option removal, but that the new option is released in HEAD.
