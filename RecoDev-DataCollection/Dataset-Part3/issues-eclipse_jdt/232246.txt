Request ASTs

I20080513-2000

This test got broken by bug 153755: In 3.3. ASTs are created for each CU in 3.4 not anymore because the default clean up requirement does not require ASTs. That's why the test is very green: 789ms vs 21ms. I would like to fix this test, I need to know if AST creation has become slower, otherwise it's hard to make any statement about the other clean up performance test.

Martin? Is this OK?
Ok, I think we don't need to approve changes in the tests.
