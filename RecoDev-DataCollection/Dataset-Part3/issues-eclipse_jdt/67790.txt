Look at the following code in the ASTView in 3.0 mode. You will see that the
source range of the ConstructorInvocation node does't include the type arguments.

public class A<X>{

	public A() {
		<X>this();
	}
}

I will investigate this one.
The problem is that I don't have the position of the starting '<'. I need to
update the parser to store it.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression test added.
This will be reviewed once the DOMParser is available. We won't need to store
the position in the compiler nodes.
