Patch implementing background search

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.callhierarchy.

I have made an attempt on implementing searching in the background.
Hi Jesper. This is a cool patch. I released it to head since the background
search is really useful. However, there are three things to be fixed:

- Search must be cancelable (e.g. with a cancel button in the toolbar, like in
the new search view). When I cancel it in the Progress View, I get an
OperationCanceledException in the log.

- The "Update..." item should not have "+" in front of it

- The current selection is lost when 'Open Call Hierarchy' is executed
(e.g. in Java Browsing perspective: select java.lang.Integer.hashCode(), Open
Call Hierarchy -> Packages, Types, and Members views become empty)

Patch implementing the requested fixes

Hi Markus,

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.ui\ui

1) Adds a cancel button and removes the stack trace in the log when cancelling
(instead the old "The search was cancelled" message is shown in the tree.)

2) Fixes the missing selection in the Java Browsing perspective. There is still
some flickering. I can try to minimize that if you don't think it's OK as it is
now.
I forgot: It also removes the '+' in front of "Updating".
> It also removes the '+' in front of "Updating".
... and also removes it in front of all other children! I corrected that in
CallHierarchyContentProvider#hasChildren(..).

CallHierarchyContentProviderTest was also failing, because hasChildren()
returned false for TreeRoots.

I took the liberty copy the improved cancel icons from search.

I released the fix, but you're certainly aware that the cancel button should be
disabled after the background search has finished. You probably have to insert
triggers in DeferredMethodWrapper#fetchDeferredChildren(..) to enable/disable
the cancel action.

Patch handling the enablement state of the cancel button

Patches against org.eclipse.jdt.ui and org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests, respectively.

Fixes the enablement state of the cancel button.
Thank you, Jesper. Now, the call hierarchy is also a proud member of the
eclipse 3.0 "do it in the background" family ;-).
