I20040529

Closing a project shows the following Java delta:
Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN | CONTENT}
   Test[-]: {}
   ResourceDelta(/Test)[*]

It should show:
Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN | CONTENT}
   Test[*]: {CLOSED}
   ResourceDelta(/Test)[*]

The F_CLOSED flag is not set.
Same problem for the F_OPENED flag.

It should show:

   Test[*]: {CLOSED}

Same problem for the F_OPENED flag.
Problem was identified investigating bug 64887 which is targeted at 3.0 RC2.

Proposed patch

Changed DeltaProcessor to create a CHANGED delta with F_CLOSED/F_OPENED flag
set if the project is closed/opened. Changed TypeHierarchy delta processing to
handle this flag.
Created attachment 11650
Updated tests

Changed JavaElementDeltaTests and JavaProjectTests to reflect this change.
Philippe should this be fixed for 3.0, or 3.1 ?
I think it is late in the game to perform such a change. We have been living 
with the bug since 2.0, and thus should stick to this behavior for 3.0, until 
we understand ramifications for our client (package explorer seems ok, but 
what about others?). 

Should release early post 3.0.
Reopening for inclusion in 3.1
Could be backported to 3.0.1 (unsure yet)
Released fix and tests in R3_0_maintenance and HEAD.
The fact that this fix brokes the all types cache (see bug 72388) is IMO a 
clear indication that we shouldn't put the fix into the maintenance build. It 
might break other clients as well. So I opt to remove the fix from the 3.0.1 
stream. Comments ?
Will revert this change in R3_0_maintance only.
Change reverted in R3_0_maintenance only. Changing target milestone to 3.1 M1.
