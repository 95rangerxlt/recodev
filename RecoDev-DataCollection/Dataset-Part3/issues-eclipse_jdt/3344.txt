	1. Load the JUnit classes, use project for sources and as output folder.
	2. Enable autobuild
	3. Edit in a class, eg. junit extensions.ActiveTest, save (->builds)
	4. When you look at the JavaElementDeltas, you see that for the
		package 'junit.extensions.ActiveTest' you have 3 changes: the CU, the class file and an inner class.
	
	5. Problem is here that the package viewer does a refresh on the not really existing element.

Given our changes in the delta area, is this one solved ?
I guess this one can be closed ?
Bug is still there (the changes in the delta processor didn't fix it).
DeltaProcessor now takes the output location of the project into account. 
Deltas in this folder are not reported. However if the output location is the 
project itself, only .class files are filtered out.
*** Bug 3291 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
