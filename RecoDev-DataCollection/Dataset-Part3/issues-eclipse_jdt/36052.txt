Quick fix erroneously removes code comments in the following situation:
- if a java class imports unused packages
- and the unused package you choose to apply a quick fix to is the first 
imported package
- and you choose to "Remove import"
- and there are comments preceding the import statement
- then quick fix will remove the import as well as all preceding comments
It looks like quick fix removes everything until the previous semi-colon which 
is not correct when there are comments.

Here is sample code:
- import into Eclipse 2.1
- Apply the quick fix of "Remove import" to the java.io package
- The comment will be removed as well


package Example;

/*
 * Comment  
 */

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;


class WordEntry
{
}
