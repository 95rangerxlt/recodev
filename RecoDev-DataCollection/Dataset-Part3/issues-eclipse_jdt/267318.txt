Build ID: M20080911-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Go to [Window] > [Preferences].
2. Go to [General] > [Content Types] at Preferences page.
3. In "Contnen types:", select [Text] > [Refactoring History File].
4. At the bottom, "Default encoding:" is "utf-8"(lowercase).

In this page, others display it by the uppercase letter.
(e.g. [Text] > [XML] -> "UTF-8"). So it should be capitalized.

They are specified at the values of the "default-charset" attributes,
in two "content-type" elements of "org.eclipse.core.runtime.contentTypes" 
extension point, the plugin.xml of org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring plug-in.

Makes sense, thanks. Fixed in HEAD.
