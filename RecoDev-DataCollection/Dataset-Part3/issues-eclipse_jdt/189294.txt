Build ID: M20070212-1330

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a POJO with boolean fields named "isDone" and "done". Example:
class Foo {
  private boolean done;
  private boolean isDone;
}
2. Menu->Source generate Getter and Setter.
3. The methods for "isDone" field is created same as "done" which is incorrect.

You're saying it should generate "public boolean IsIsdone()"??? That sounds redundant to me. I question whether this is a bug that eclipse needs to address. 
If we to use the class as java bean, then IsIsDone() must exist, otherwise it consider a missing method by other reflection tool. Granted we shouldn't name boolean this way, but eclipse should not chg the contract of the getter method signature, right?

We want to follow the Java beans naming conventions. See also bug 154823.
*** Bug 263997 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Looked at this again: the summary is wrong, as the issue is not with the getter but with the setter in case where the preference to generate boolean getters with 'is' prefix.

it should generate:
getDone
setDone
getIsDone
setIsDone
