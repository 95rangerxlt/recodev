patch for x-friending

There are a few places in JDT Debug UI where we make use of some internal code from JDT UI. It would be nice to remove these warnings, and with the limited resources we should just consider x-friending JDT Debug UI.

In case there is API we could be using (that I just don't know about) here are the illegal uses:

1. we use the TemplateEngine, JavaParameterListValidator, JavaContextType and calls to JavaPlugin.getDefault().getTemplateContextRegistry() in  JavaDebugContentAssistProcessor

2. we access WorkingCopyManager and JavaUI.getWorkingCopyManager()).getWorkingCopy(input, primaryOnly) in our DebugWorkingCopyManager 

3. We access JavaPlugin, EditorUtility and your image registry in JDIModelPresentation

4. We access TemplateEngine, JavaParameterLstValidator and JavaPlugin in JavaSnippetCompletionProcessor 

5. We access OpenTypeeirarchyUtil in OpenTypeAction

6. We access IJavaHelpContextIDs, PackageExplorerPart and a bunch of constants in ShowInPackageViewAction

7. we extend / use BaseCompilationUnitEditorActioinContributor in SnippetEditorActionContributor
