here is an example java code:

// comments blah blah
s1 = "ssss";

now select "quick fix" (press Ctrl+1) at line 2, choose "create local 
varible 's1'", the upper comments are deleted.

This is not specific to AJDT, it happens with JDT on its own. It fails with
Eclipse 3.0 and 3.1M1. I'm therefore passing the bug over to JDT.
Moving to JDT UI for comments.
this has been fixed fo M4
