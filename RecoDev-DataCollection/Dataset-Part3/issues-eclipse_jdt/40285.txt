In the following example, code assist sees the two bar methods, 
but selecting any method from the list completes the call to bar(),
although selecting the second bar should complete the call to
Foo.this.bar();

class Foo
{
	void Foo()
	{
		new Inner()
		{
			public void bar()
			{
				bar<ctrl space>
			}
		}
	}
	
	interface Inner
	{
		void bar(); 
	}

	void bar()
	{
	}
}

just checked at 3.1M4 and it works.
