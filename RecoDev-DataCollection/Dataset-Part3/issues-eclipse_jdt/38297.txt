I have a file called SillyBean.jardesc in my workspace, that was created by using the Export 
Jar --> Save Description facility. The content looks like this: 
 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<jardesc> 
    <jar path="/home/markus/SillyBean.jar"/> 
    <options overwrite="true" compress="false" exportErrors="false" 
        exportWarnings="true" saveDescription="true" 
        descriptionLocation="/SillyBean/SillyBean.jardesc" 
        useSourceFolders="false" buildIfNeeded="true"/> 
    <manifest manifestVersion="1.0" usesManifest="true" 
        reuseManifest="false" saveManifest="false" 
        generateManifest="false" manifestLocation="/SillyBean/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"> 
        <sealing sealJar="false"> 
            <packagesToSeal/> 
            <packagesToUnSeal/> 
        </sealing> 
    </manifest> 
    <selectedElements exportClassFiles="true" exportJavaFiles="false"> 
        <javaElement handleIdentifier="=SillyBean/src"/> 
    </selectedElements> 
</jardesc> 
 
Whenever I try "Open" or "Open In... Jar Description Editor" the file opens in the normal text 
editor. I cannot edit the description, still it is possible to build the jar by "Create Jar". Seems 
that wizard cannot read it's own generated xml files in some circumstances. 
 
I saw this on Eclipse 2.1 on Windows 2000 and SuSE LINUX 8.2 GTK.

Why? Is the file read-only? Do you get an exception?

>Open In...
I assume you meant "Open With..." ("Open In..." is not contributed by Eclipse)

If you want to "edit" the JAR description in the wizard you can use "Open JAR
Packager..." just above "Create JAR"

Sorry, I was not clear enough. The problem is that when double clicking the file, a text editor 
opens for manual xml editing of the jardesc file, but I want the Jar Packaging Wizard to be 
opened. I can open that wizard with the menu item "Open Jar Packager", but I want to open it 
with double click. The file is not read only. 
I adapted the summary to your comments.

This is not possible with the current platform support. Only editors can be
linked with a file extension (e.g. .jardesc) and therefore only an editor can be
opened with double click.

If the platform would offer to contribute an "open" delegate then I could open
the wizard on double-click.

Moving to Platform UI for comment.

This is now possible using the 'launcher' attribute.
Fixed in HEAD.

I tried to do the same for the "Open Javadoc Wizard..." action, but that one is not so easy, so I filed bug 247144.
