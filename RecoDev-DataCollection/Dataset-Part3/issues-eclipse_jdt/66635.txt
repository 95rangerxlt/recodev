Martin, can you please assess how "dangerous" this is. If we can end up in a 
siutation where the user gets the feeling of a dead lock we should consider 
fixing this if it isn't to risky.
The problem is that after the access to the all types cache, the user might be 
prompted to make a selection. So just wrapping everything in a workbench 
runnable is a bit more work as we have to introduce a callback element for the 
user interaction.
It's not high risk, though.
