Steps To Reproduce:
Hi,

In the file
eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.ui\org\eclipse\jdt\internal\ui\text\javadoc\JavaDocMessages.properties

We came across the following sentence:

JavaDoc2HTMLTextReader_since_section=Since:

What does "Since" mean here?
Can we treat it as from here?

Please help to confirm it and thanks a lot in advance!

More information:
All the strings in there are used when producing the real Javadoc out of the comment in the source which are following a Javadoc tag (@since, @param, @return, @author, @throws, @see), e.g.

@since 3.4
-->
Since: 3.4
(in English)

@author Dani
-->
Author: Dani

@see java.lang.Object
-->

Unfortunately this is a indeterministic problem: if the programmer writes his comments in English and wants to see/produce English Javadoc then translating these strings would mess his Javadoc up. On the other hand, if he writes his comments in non-English and we don't translate - same problem.

I guess the common case is to leave this in English, especially since we produce LTR Javadoc.
