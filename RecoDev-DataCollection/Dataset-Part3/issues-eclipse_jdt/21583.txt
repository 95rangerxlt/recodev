In the export wizard for generating javadoc, there is no easy way to link the
javadoc from a prereqed project.  The wizard has a screen for linking in javadoc
from libraries included in the classpath, but projects in the classpath do not
show up.  I got a temporary workaround from the news group.  Just add a "-link
URL_TO_OTHER_PROJECT_JAVADOC" in the javadoc options page, but there should be
an easier way to do this.
