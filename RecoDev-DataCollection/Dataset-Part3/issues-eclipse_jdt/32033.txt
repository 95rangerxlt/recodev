The current handling of spaces for tab preferences is confusing:
- there are too many (distributed) preferences
- why do I have to touch code formatter preferences?
  e.g. if I want spaces when I type TAB I have to go to Editor->Typing but this
does not affect when I type {+RETURN. I have to set this on the Code Formatter
preference page. How should I know that the code formatter is involved? I would
expect this on the Typing preference page.


Talked with Kai. He agrees that the preference on the Typing page should be
consulted when enabling/disabling spaces for TABS on return.

The number of spaces which are inserted per TAB comes from the Code Formatter
page as indicated along with the preference on the Typing page.
