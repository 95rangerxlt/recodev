RetargetToolbarAction is subclassing RetargetAction which states in its class 
docs that it is not to be extended by clients.

I need to rename a method in the RetargetAction class. I will keep the old 
method around for a couple of integration build so you can update this class.

On another note, is there anything the workbench can provide that would avoid 
the need for this subclass?

Which method are you going to delete? I cannot see the comment.
The workbench could provide retarget tool bar actions so that I am not forced 
to either subclass or copy everything.
The method "propogateChange" has a typo that needs to be fixed. Should 
be "propagateChange".

I will look at your request for retarget tool bar actions.

I will annotate this PR once the method rename is done and released to head.
Method has been deprecated and released but it was too late to go into today's 
integration build. Will be part on the next one. Method will be removed a 
couple of integration build after that.
