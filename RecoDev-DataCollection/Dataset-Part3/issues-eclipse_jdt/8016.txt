The Java element delta for getter/setter are not generated. It seems that the 
working copy is comparing oldInfo and newInfo where the oldInfo is already the 
newInfo, thus no delta is generated.

moving to jdt.core.

How are you adding getter/setter ? Are you simply editing the working copy or 
using something different ?
I select a field in the outliner and use the context menu item 'Create 
Getter/Setter'.

What evidence do you have this is jdt.core ? If you edit the working copy, then 
the reconciler picks the change without any problem.

What APIs are you calling ? 
I'm not the owner of create getter/setter (cc'ing Martin). It's using 
IType.createMethod() to create the method stubs.

I have set a break point in JavaOutlinePage.ElementChangeListener to see if 
element changes are fired. The element changes are sent for adding members 
manually, but not for 'create getter/setter'.

I stepped through WorkingCopy.reconcile(). When the delta builder is 
constructed, the java elements for the method stubs are considered to be old.
The result is that there is no change when adding these method stubs and 
therefore no delta is generated.

The create method operation is making the working consistent, thus if the 
reconciler runs after that, it doesn't see any changes.

Fixed by forcing a reconcile when the WorkingCopy.save(...) is called (by the 
operation). This makes the working copy consistent and fires the fine-grain 
deltas.
