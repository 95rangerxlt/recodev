StringLiteral.setLiteralValue does not do Unicode escaping.
StringLiteral.setLiteralValue doesn't need to do the Unicode escaping. This is done in the 
setEscapedValue() called by StringLiteral.setLiteralValue. The bug was in fact in the 
StringLiteral.getLiteralValue.
Regression tests added: 
ASTTest.testStringLiteralUnicode().
Fixed and released in HEAD.
