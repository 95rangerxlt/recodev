User feedback:
"Confused how to create my first project"
We should be more supportive in the UI for this special case since it is a 
first time experience with the UI.

Therefore when the workbench is empty we should offer to create a new Java 
project.
Minimal solution is to show an info dialog that explains that user should 
create a project first and offer a button to open the Java project wizard.

The same is true for the new package and new interface buttons.

When you try to create a new Class/.. on a empty workspace, the 
NewProjectWizard-wizard first pops up ands allows you to create a project first.
