I chose to generate ANT xml file. Next time the option was unchecked.
This was my intention. My reasoning was that the user wouldn't want to 
overwrite the Ant file they had created on thier last run of the wizard. The 
current implementation prevents the user from accidentaly overwriting an Ant 
script they created during an earlier exicution of the wizard. Thoughts?

JRT.
Yes. Ask the user if a file gets overwritten or offer a setting.
See other PR that I filed about overwriting files.

Pls. note: there's another PR which says that the xml file is not even
regenerated when I check the option again.
BTW: since you run in the background best would be to generate the ant file as
first action - don't know if this is possible or if you need to run javadoc first.
Right now a warning appears in the head of the wizard dialog stating that the 
Ant file will be overwritten. 
JRT.
there will be a new api on the wizardpage to have the warning icon rendered 
with the warning message 
The warning icon now appears making the warning much more noticable. For now 
the the name of the antfile generated is presisted but the option remains 
unchecked. Comments? JRT.
If I see the yellow warning icon then it is ok.
fixed. JRT.
