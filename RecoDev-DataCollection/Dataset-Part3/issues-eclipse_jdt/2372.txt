I find it very difficult to find the project (and source folder) of a compilation unit opened in an editor.
	There is no indication where this compilation comes from (in the status bar or somewhere else).
	You have to scroll through the Package View to find it highlighted (in a light blue which makes it
	difficult to distinguish).
	Would it be possible to show the path to the compilation unit in the status bar when the Java editor
	has the focus?

NOTES:

	I also would like to have a F3 key on an empty selection to select the input file in the package view 

	Rigth now you have to choose 'Show in Package View' on the type in the outliner to do this

	The tooltip in the editor tab shows you the absolute path name.

The path is available in the tooltip for the editor. Consider as a post 2.0

See 2069 as well.
Has been fixed some time ago: hover over the editor tab
