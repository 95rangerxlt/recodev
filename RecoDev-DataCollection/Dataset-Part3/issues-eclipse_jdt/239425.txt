3.4

- Select a project and press 'Delete'
- A dialog asks you if you are sure to delete the resource from the file system, but still offers you a check box to decide if the project is really removed from disk.

The bug got introduced by fix for bug 234959.

We should revert the message to what it was in 3.3.

patch

The patch changes the to dialog labels the following messages (single/multiple delete)

Are you sure you want to remove project ''{0}'' from the workspace?
Are you sure you want to remove these {0} projects from the workspace?

I think this is better than what we had in 3.3:

Are you sure you want to delete project ''{0}''
released for 3.5 > 20080307

Should also fix in 3.4.1
Agree that it looks a bit strange but unfortunately we can only fix this by introducing a new NLS string key. We have to make sure that we don't introduce missing strings in non-English 3.4.1. I'll have to double-check that before we commit this to 3.4.1.
Sorry, not for 3.4.x.
