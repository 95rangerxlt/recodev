there's a limitation in move instance method refactoring that does not allow 
one to move a method to another class if that another class is in the same file 
as the source class

we should remove this limitation

Could not find reason for restriction. Suggest removing it.
(I just commented it out; maybe remove it altogether, along with the called
query and the NLS string.)
please note that after you press 'preview' you see the same file twice, with 
different modifications - that's how the restriction manifests itself.
i did not look at the code now but i'm suspecting it's using 2 rewrites - one 
for source, one for target file
which is incorrect if these files are the same

Yes, there were 2 CompilationUnitChanges on the same CU.
I introduced a TextChangeManager to take care of this.

Testcases still pass.
great, thanks
