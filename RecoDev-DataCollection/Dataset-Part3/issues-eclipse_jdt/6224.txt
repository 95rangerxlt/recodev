you should also offer rename in normal comments as well....
e.g
void method(Object x)
{
 if(x instanceof String) //if x == null this will return false
 {
  ...
 }
}
only as pure text search, i guess
I am not sure what you mean by "only as a pure text search", but if you rename 
a field the third checkbox down says:
"Update references in regular comments". However that functionality is done is 
how it should be done here!
yeah, simple minded text search
i'll be somewhat reluctant when it comes to param names, though - they tend to 
be less meanigful than type names for instance. 
so people would have to and carefully look at each suggested modification.

In the mean time one can use the CheckStyle Plugin which will at least inform 
you when you forget to change the comment manually.
