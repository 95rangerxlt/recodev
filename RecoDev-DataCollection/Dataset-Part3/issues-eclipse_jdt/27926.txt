This is still present in Eclipse 2.1.0 final.

Similarly the following don't get exported when exporting all preferences:
 * the code generation templates under Java --> Code Generation --> Code and
Comments
 * keyboard shortcuts under Workbench --> Keys

If kind of defeats the purpose of the button to export all preferences if not
all the preferences get exported.
