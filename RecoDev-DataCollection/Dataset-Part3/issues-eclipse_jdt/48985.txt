1) Import Junit 3.8.1 as per smoke test
2) Select the "protect()" method on the inner class in TestResult.run(TestCase)
in the java editor
3) from the context menu, select "Pull Up".
4) You get an error message saying: "Pull up is not allowed on elements declared
in this type".

I would expect a reason why it's not allowed. Is it because it's an inner class?

Agree, that we have to improve this. I am aware of another case were this 
generic error message is shown: if the super class is binary. 


Ok, that explains a couple of other cases I've just found. I'll annotate this PR
if I find cases where the superclas is not binary.
The error message in the case that the super class is binary got improved for 
3.0.
