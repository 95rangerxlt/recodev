- dialog title should read "Confirm Delete" not "Delete"
- the dialog page will not wrap if text is too long since CLable doesn't 
  support wrap style.

In general, should we implement a "reusable" message page ?

1 is trivial
2 is hard to believe - how come there's no WRAP? :-)

i guess i will just put the image and a normal label in a composite, next to 
each other
btw, should we make the dialog not resizable?
Yes, but then we have to add another boolean method to the wizard. This is ok 
for me. I will fold them into a style flag in near future.
i created a MessageInputPage
that has a string and a label

we use it now in the delete and the inline temp dialog

do you fix the wrapping and do i do?
fixed, it wraps now
