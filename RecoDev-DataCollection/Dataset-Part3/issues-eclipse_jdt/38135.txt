In the following class, object2 is correctly marked as unused. The "remove 
unused field" quick fix will wrongly remove *both* fields, though.

public class Foo {
  
  private Object object, object2;

  public Object getObject() {
    return object;
  }

}

This seems to be a regression of bug 31389
