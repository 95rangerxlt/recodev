I opened a Java Editor on a UTF-8 encoded file from the CVS Repo view. The editor opened using the standard workbench encoding CP1252, which caused problems when trying to view the file. I tried to switch encoding of the opened editor by going to Edit>Set Encoding... but the item was disabled. 

Note that .properties files will allow you to change the encodings.
