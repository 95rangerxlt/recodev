Build ID: M20080221-1800

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create an interface with a method
2. Manually create an implementation of that interface's method in a class. (Must be manual, because using automatic code generation puts in the annotation.)
3. Save the file.
4. The override annotation isn't added as expected.



More information:
The problem doesn't happen when automatically generating the method stub (cursor in the editor window; using ctrl+<space> and selecting the interface method).

Note: The Java6 API javadoc doesn't mention that interface method implementations can use the override annotation, but it is supported by the compiler.

What is the difference between [Java -> Code Style -> Clean Up] and [Java -> Editor -> Save Actions]?
I'm using the built-in eclipse profile for Clean Up.
Both have the same setting enabled for "Add missing '@Override' annotations"

Moving to JDT/UI
Clean up does whatever the compiler says: If the compiler says 'no missing annotation' it will not add it, which is allowed. Our code generation does add override annotations if > 1.5, which is allowed as well, but inconsistent.

Fixed in HEAD.

Since bug 163194 added a new compiler option and a separate problem ID, I also added a separate checkbox to configure this for Clean Up and Save Actions.
