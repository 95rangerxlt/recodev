build 20020426

This bug spawned off of bug 13651.
The Java editor should not supply line background colors when printing. It 
should temporarily remove its LineBackgroundListener and add it back when the 
call to StyledText.print(Printer) returns.

In addition, the LineBackgroundListener may just leave the line background 
color null when it wants to return the default widget background color. 
Currently it explicitly sets the widget background color which causes the 
printed output to appear with the screen background color.

Until we have a complete printing story with line numbers, heards, footers etc. 
we should not do anything - defer
