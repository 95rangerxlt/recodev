Breadcrumbs should work with IPackageDeclaration and IImportDeclaration.
- I cannot select these elements when they are shown in the breadcrumbs bar.
- When I select these elements in the editor and then press Alt+Shift+B three times, the selection in the editor jumps to the first type declaration in the file.

This elements are children of ICU, but the breadcrumb does only show types. Either:
- we don't show it in the drop down
- we fake it like the browsing perspective does and let them be children of some type
- we also show the ICUs

Opinions?


I think IPackageDeclaration, IImportDeclaration and IImportContainer are not interesting in the breadcrumbs bar, so I would not show them at all.

However, we need a strategy to avoid inadvertent caret movements when the user presses Alt+Shift+B. I suggest to fix this problem by making sure that selection changes in the breadcrumb triggered by "Show in Breadcrumb" will never change the text selection. This would also fix similar problems when nothing is selected in the breadcrumb bar and Alt+Shift+B selects the type and also changes the text selection.
Agree with Markus.

Never show package and import declarations. The surprising selection change in the editor is fixed by fix 'erichs strategy' in bug 215830
