Create the Example project JUnit.

1) move ActiveTestSuite.java from junit.extension to the junit package using 
the move action
2) the junit package doesn't show up in the packages view

The delta we are getting from JCore is correct, but it looks
like the JavaModel isn't up to date. When asking calling
hasChildren() on "junit" false is returned.

Smells like we did not close the affected element when adding the moved child.
Problem was only when moving a cu from/to a package that was the pre/suffix of 
the original package.
The delta processor was creating the wrong element, thus not updating the java 
model. (this wrong element was not showing up for the client since the delta 
created by the operation was fired).
