Hello.

Options like 'Hide fields', 'Hide static members' and 'Hide non public members' 
in 'Outline' view could be implemented as 'Filters' similar to latter 
in 'Package explorer' view.
Also 'Hide import declarations' option could be added to the 'Outline' view. 
This option should hide all childs of 'import declarations' in the view's tree.

Best regards,
Stanislav Bernatsky.
