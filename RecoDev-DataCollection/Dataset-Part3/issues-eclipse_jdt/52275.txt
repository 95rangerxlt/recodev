I have a custom builder which is invoked after a save (CTRL+S) that identifies
problems with resources in my non-Java project and marks the resource with
errors (or clears them as needed).

This seems to work fine except that the problem marker icons in the Package
Explorer are for some reason not automatically updated.

Selecting the 'Go Into' context menu option and then navigating back again shows
the correct problem marker icon state. Alternatively, closing and opening the
project/eclipse displays the correct icon state.

Is there something that needs to be called in order to 'refresh' the problem
markers in the Package Explorer view?

This is happening under Linux (RH9) using Eclipse 2.1.2

I assume you are not in a Java project. The updater currently has this
'optimization'. I'm going to remove it sice the package explorer now shows
non-java projects.
