Build: Build id: 200212041234

I got into a state where typing a comment in the contents of a method line 
entered the comment characters in reverse order, resulting in the following:

   adjustParentCount(file, true /*ytrid

when I intended to type

   adjustParentCount(file, true /*dirty

I also could using the backspace key to delete the characters (I had to select 
the whole comment to delete it).

Changing the focus to another app (IE) and back again has fixed the problem. I 
don't know if it's related but the method I was invoking did not yet exist. I 
tried another such method and got the same behavior so it seems reproducable.

It happens with being in template mode.
