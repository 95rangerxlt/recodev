Build ID: M20070212-1330

Steps To Reproduce:
I know this code seems nonsensical, but it came up in the real world, since the fields originally weren't static.  The quickfix should either work or not be offered.

STEPS:

1) A quick fix lightbulb shows for LINE 3.  Click on the lightbulb to get a popup menu of fixes.

2) Choose the "Change access to static...".  See that wrongly nothing happens.

-------------------- Bug.java ----------------------
class Bug {
   static Bug a,b;
   int x=Bug.a.b.hashCode(); // LINE 3
}
