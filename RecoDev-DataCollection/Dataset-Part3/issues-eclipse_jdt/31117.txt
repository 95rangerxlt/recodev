Build M5

1. New / Project / Java Project
Name "J1"
Hit Next.

Observe: Project J3 appears in the resource navigator.

2. On Java settings wizard page, hit Cancel.

Observe: Project J3 disappears from the resource navigator.

3. Use Windows Explorer to look at <workspace>/

Observe: <workspace>/J1/.project exists and contains
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
	<name>J2</name>
	<comment></comment>
	<projects>
	</projects>
	<buildSpec>
	</buildSpec>
	<natures>
	</natures>
</projectDescription>

Expectation: <workspace>/J1/.project should get deleted. So should
<workspace>/J1/ if it had just been created.

Martin, can you please comment on this.

The contents are now removed if the project dir did not exist before. SO if the 
project has been set to an external, existing location, no content is removed. 
This means that there wil still be a .project file lying around in this case.
