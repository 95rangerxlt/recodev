Backport said fix to 4.2.2+.
New Gerrit change created: https://git.eclipse.org/r/50393
Gerrit change https://git.eclipse.org/r/50393 was merged to [R3_8_maintenance].
Commit: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=a232bdec81b10f942e126db663f7a6e7c79065f1
I've squashed the two original commits and removed the special case for inherited null annotations (feature only supported in 4.3+).

JUnits are green and manual testing confirmed that the scenarios from bug 386410 and bug 350396 are fixed now. The Gerrit build failure is expected, since R3_8_maintenance is not ready for Gerrit builds.
