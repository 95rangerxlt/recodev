- Double-click a class to open its editor.
- Copy the class using context menu -> Copy... in the Packages view.
- Do not notice that:
  a) the copy was named "CopyOf<theClass>" and it is not even visible in your 
Packages view
  b) the open editor - even though it looks like the copy - is in fact still on 
the *original* class
- Randomly start typing and making changes in your *original* class, which of 
course you have to back out of as soon as you realize that you are not editing 
the new class.

Please select the new copy of the class, and open it in an editor, after the 
Copy... is done. This is what the user is expecting - after all, they created a 
new class in order to start working on it.
Leaving the old class sitting there is completely non-intuitive.
At the very least, add a *persistent* checkbox option to the Copy dialog that 
says "Open Editor on new copy". I think the default should be "on".

Note that Rename... has the same problem. You rename a class, and the Packages 
tree does not scroll, the new class is not visible, and there is no editor 
opened on the new class. The user is expecting all of these things to happen, 
and they do not.

Regarding Copy:
  - the current behaviour is consistent with the Navigator. Kevin, what
    is the platform opinion ? IMO copy should work like this (as proposed by
    Carolyn):
    o the copied file should be selected after the copy
    o there should be a persistent check box "Open in editor" on the 
      copy dialog.

Regarding Rename:
  - the element should be selected after the rename. Adam, please fix this.
the package viewer seems not to refresh soon enough after resource changes

after renaming a package, for instance, i had a pointer to the new package
i tried calling
PackageExplorerPart p= PackageExplorerPart.getFromActivePerspective();
p.selectAndReveal(newPackage);

this, however, had no effect because newPackage did not yet exist in the 
package viewer tree.

You have to resort to using an asyncExec. Because of a dead lock we can no 
longer update the packages view with syncExec.

The reveal code we are using in the New wizard actions is in
BasicNewResourceWizard.selectAndReveal and it works.


ok, it works for me too
(another piece of useful worbench code not available to everyone - 
it should be a static method in a util class somewhere)

i will have to duplicate the code
oh, well
