toString() generator adding the fields in alphabetical order. It would be better if it adds in the order whatever the order fields declared in the class.

Moving from APT to Text - this has nothing to do with APT.
We had a similar problem with 'Generate Constructor using Fields', see bug 215161. The essence of the fix there was that IType#getFields() is always in source order (that's also the case for IType#getChildren()).

If the alphabetic order is still deemed worthwhile in the end, we could add a 'Sort' button on the right.

Mateusz, are you interested?
Yep, I'm on it.
