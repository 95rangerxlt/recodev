For certain names, the smart cursor on Java names option is now working 
properly. This happens only when this option is used in conjunction with prev-
word functionality (using ctrl-left or similar keystroke).

Here are steps to reproduce:
1. Edit a java file and add a line similar to this:
 if (object.getURLEncoder() == null) 
2. Place cursor directly to the left of the () for method call
3. Hit ctrl-right arrow to invoke prev-word
4. Notice that the cursor is not placed directly between 'get' 
and 'URLEncoder' it is instead placed to the right of 'object.'
