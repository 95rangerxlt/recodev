As part of the effort to incorporate context sensitive launching in Eclipse a
new attribute has been added to the launchShortcuts extension point to map the

This attribute is optional, but will mean Junit related launch shortcuts get
filtered from certain views.

Will attach a patch adding new attribute to junit launch shortcut
