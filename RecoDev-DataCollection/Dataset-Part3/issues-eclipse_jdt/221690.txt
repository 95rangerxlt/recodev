Thanks Martin!
I've committed the JFace Text code with minor modifications. JDT Text code to be committed as soon as all my tests pass.
Remaining things to do:
- honor enablement preference
- don't use 3 different colors in one row
- add ':' to separate method return type and variable type
Committed JDT Text part to HEAD with minor modifications.

>- honor enablement preference
Suggest that clients handle this and we spec that ICompletionProposalExtension6.getStyledDisplayString() can return 'null' if no custom draw support should be used
Moving to Martin for the remaining things.
- don't use 3 different colors in one row
- add ':' to separate method return type and variable type
