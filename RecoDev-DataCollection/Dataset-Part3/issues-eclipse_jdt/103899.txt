Remove references to generated output dir from APT config.

Remove references to generated output dir from APT config.
This is referring to the GENBINDIR, not GENSRCDIR.  It has already been removed 
from the UI, but needs to also be removed from the apt.core code.
Removed from string constants in AptPreferenceConstants.  Doesn't appear to 
have been present anywhere else.  (Grepped all source for -i genbindir.)
