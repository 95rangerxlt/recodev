The jdt.apt.core plug-in project is set to ignore warnings about unchecked conversion and use of raw types.  This is because it has to translate between the JDT DOM API, which uses raw types, and the APT API, which uses generic types; so there are otherwise a lot of such warnings.

However, some of those warnings are legitimate; they're simply cases where the programmer forgot to use genericized types.

We should make a pass through the code with the warnings re-enabled, to clean up the sloppy cases.

All unchecked conversion and raw type related warnings have been either fixed or suppressed with @SuppressWarnings.

There are still some unrelated build warnings coming from recently deprecated extension point attributes.  Fixing those is blocked on bug 155147.  But that's not what this bug is about, so resolving as fixed.

Target milestone should be changed to 3.3 M2, but I don't have sufficient privileges to do so.
