Follow up of bug 412453
I am assuming that this was a user visible exception that aborted the
compilation and was not just an internally swallowed exception.

Please follow up. TIA.
Please attach a small test case while the steps are still clear as to
how to reproduce, Thanks

Yes. This is a user visible exception that aborted the build.

Patch for the fix

Patch for the fix
Smaller test case: 

// ---
interface I {
	String sam();
}

public class X {
	static String foo(I i) { return ""; }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		foo(() -> foo(X::getInt)); 
	} 
	static Integer getInt() { return 0; }
}

Anirban, please see that there is a difference in the behavior between
the reference compiler and ECJ compiler on the regression test you are adding.
We should not codify wrong/suspect behavior this way as it will lead to
wasted cycles down stream.

So I suggest a two pronged strategy:

(1) Fix the current bug wrt to the new small test case.
(2) Raise a follow up bug and assign to Stephan as it likely involves
unfinished portions of type inference work.

Jay can you please release and resolve - I am still trying to sort out why
