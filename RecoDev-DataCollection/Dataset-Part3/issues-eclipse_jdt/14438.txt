Would it be possible to support setting a comment on jars? I'm more interested 
in doing this via the API than the UI. One approach would be to set something 
in the JarPackageData which the JarWriter can extract and call setComment() on 
the JarOutputStream. Alternatively, if the output stream were made accessible 
to subclasses of JarWriter, I could have my own writer handle this.
The ability to set a comment is actually at the ZipOutputStream level, so maybe 
this needs to go even further down.

Possible but most likely after 2.0


Simple request - quickly hacked it in.
