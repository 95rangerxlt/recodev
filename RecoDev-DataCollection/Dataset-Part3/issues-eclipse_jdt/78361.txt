Java's versioning system changed from release 1.4 to the current Tiger release.
Java is now called Java 5.0, not Java 1.5. Any references to "1.5" in Sun's
documentation, file names, and so on, is for backwards compatibility. Eclipse
should follow this convention to prevent confusion and promote consistency (and
accuracy).
