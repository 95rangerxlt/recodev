I am working on a GEF application that supports drag and drop of Java classes 
from the Package Explorer. With source code (.java files) this works fine, but 
when I try to drag a compiled class (.class from a JAR withtin a project) it 
seems that the drag doesn't even get initiated. It is
possibly, however, to open .class file within an Editor (e.g. with a 
doubleclick).

I think this behavior is inconsistent and it should be possible to initiate a 
drag for a .class file just like a .java file since both end up in an IType.

This envolves recoding parts of the DnD infrastructure in the package 
explorer. No action planned for 3.0.
Fixed for M5.
