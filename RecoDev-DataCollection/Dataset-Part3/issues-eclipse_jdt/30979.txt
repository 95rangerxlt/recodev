Integration build 200302050800

We have a bug in SWT which exposed this problem but I am entering this bug 
report since the handling of the problem is not right.

Due to the bug on the Mac (see build 200302050800) we get an NPE in 
NewElementWizardPage.

Steps:
1) In a new workspace, in the Resource perspective, in the the Navigator view, 
from the context menu select New -> Project.
2) Select Java + Java Project and then hit return (DO NOT click on the Next 
button to go to the next page as this will not show the problem).
3) Enter some text in the project name field.  Note that the finish button does 
not become enabled.
4)Click on the Back button.

Either in step 3 or step 4 you will get the NPE (I have both cases happen for 
me).
