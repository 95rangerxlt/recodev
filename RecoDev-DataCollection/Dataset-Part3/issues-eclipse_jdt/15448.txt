we have moved to use the JDT core provided mechanism. Martin is the problem 
with us or JDT CORE?
it's only when restarting eclipse, but not when reopening the pref page.
-> the persistence

persistance has moved to jcore.
Preferences weren't saved (thought it happened for free, given load does).
Also index flushing did discard saved preferences (should only discard *.index 
files).

Fixed
