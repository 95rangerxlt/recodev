I found that the Ctrl-Shift-Space combination gives a popup dialogue which shows
me the possible completions of which I can select one, after which the
corresponding information hovers as a tooltip.

The popup dialogue is much too narrow to be useful in the complex cases (which
is where I usually need help), and the content does not resize when the dialogue
is resized.  A black border is drawn instead on the revealed area.

Resizing is bug 54943. The popup being too narrow is a new request.
Moving to text.
Fixed bug 54943. The window is now bigger (our size hint was not respected).
Please reopen if it is still to small when using I20040824 or newer.
