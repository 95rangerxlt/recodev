public class A {
	void ex() throws Exception { }
	void run() {
		A a = new A();//TODO 1
		a.ex();
		//TODO 2
	}
}

- enable all items in the menu of the toolbar button "Go To Next Annotation"
-> Ctrl+. works as expected

- set cursor into ex of a.ex() and press Ctrl+Shift+G
-> 2 different cases (I can't tell how force one case):

a) "a.ex()" gets red wiggly
  - jumping to next annotation (Ctrl+.) shows "unhandled exception" warning only
very shortly in the StatusLine

b) "a." gets red wiggly, "ex()" gets gray wiggly
  - jumping to next annotation (Ctrl+.) shows "unhandled exception" warning in
the StatusLine first red, then black

The red/black inconsistency has been fixed. The reason why the status is cleared
and later reappears when stepping to the search match is because
- the search match region is a sub-region of the error
- the post selection notification comes with a delay
