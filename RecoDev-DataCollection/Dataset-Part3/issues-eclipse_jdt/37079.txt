I imported Templates from Version 2.02 into version 2.1 Build 200211151436
(V2.2M4 if I remember correctly but memory is a forgetful faculty)

Afterwards Using one of the imported templates the text typed replacing a
variable would appear backwards (Letters would get pushed to the right and new
letter inserted at first (leftmost) position)

The Code coloring would sometimes be completly erratic afterwards once we exited
from the variable link (via tab or enter).  Once the Tamplate would be removed
the coloring reverted back to normal.

here what apeared in the culprid template

/* /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *	${SectionName}
 */
${cursor}

the name of the template was docSectionHeader.

When executing the template the generated output once the tab-link were followed
though for a Attributes section was

/* /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 *	Asetubirtt
 */

The pattern could be repeated for any imported templates that had custom
variables in them.
Templates created natively before or after the import with custom variables
behaved as expected.

I guess this has been fixed with the linked mode overhaul. Please reopen if you
still encounter this.
