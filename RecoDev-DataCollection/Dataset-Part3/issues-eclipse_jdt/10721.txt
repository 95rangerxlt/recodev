Using Team 2.0
Source follows

Test case:
Have a cu shared via the team support 
Modify the compilation unit (change the "do nothing" comment to "do nothing at 
all" in the catch block)
Save
Use the team support, right click in the packages view on cu->Replace With-
>Remote Contents

Syntax hightlighting is gone in the source following where the comment was 
changed (the throwBaby method)

Source:
public class ThrowsNPE {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ThrowsNPE anObject = new ThrowsNPE();
		try {
			anObject.throwBaby();
		} catch(NullPointerException ne) {
			// do nothing
		}
	}

	public void throwBaby() {
		throw new NullPointerException();
	}
}
