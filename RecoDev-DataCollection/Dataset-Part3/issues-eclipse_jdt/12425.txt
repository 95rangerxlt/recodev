we are developing plugins for eclipse, where each plugin is a seperate project.
at the end we would like to generate an integrated documentation one index.html 
and hyperlinks between the plugin's sources.

however, this requires the generation wizard to beeing able to generate the 
documentation for several projects at one

Note that this isn't trivial, as every project has it's own classpath.
Therefor Javadoc.exe has to be executed separatly for every project.

We plan to add the link feature, so that a documenttaion links to other 
referenced jdoc documentation.
 
At the moment we have to export the sources of all projects to a temp directory 
tree and then run javadoc to make sure, that we get an index of all packages
and have links between the projects.

Adding the javadoc-link-feature to Eclipse will solve the "links between 
several projects" requirement. But still there will be no overall index
for the documentation.


jannifer, can you experiment with multiple project selections?
if proj A is a prerequisite of proj B then both projects could be selected at 
the same time.
fixed.
JRT.
