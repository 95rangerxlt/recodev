Patch

Attached patch contains the quick assist and tests.

The patch first checks all the conditions that can prevent the conversion and then performs the conversion.

Type annotations on explicitly typed lambda parameter types are not checked while converting to method reference.

QuickAssistProcessor#getCopiedTypeArguments is same as (with changed signature) QuickAssistProcessor#getTypeArguments from the patch of bug 428741.

Markus, please have a look.
