When using the 'for' xource code completion it used to automatically choose the most recently defined collection but now doesn't...

If I enter the following line...

List trimParts = presentation.getLayout().getTrimForParts();

...and hot Ctrl-Space and select 'iterate over collection' I now get the following...

for (Iterator iterator = alwaysOffActionSets.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
  type name = (type) iterator.next();
}

Note that the collection is 'alwaysOffActionSets' rather than 'trimParts' which is what I used to get. Not sure but perhaps the choice is alphabetical now?

Fixed in HEAD.
