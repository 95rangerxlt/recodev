Open "New Java Class" wizard.
1)Immediately after opening the wizard you do not see any error messages, although the Name: field and sometimes Source folder are empty and because of that you cannot press the Finish button. User who sees this wizard for the first time is confused. After you try to find out what is wrong you finally see the error. But immediately after opening you dont.

2)The error message "Folder name is empty" could be more helpful, if there is "Source folder name is empty". This could prevent user from guessing which folder. 
(the message is displayed when the "Source folder:" input is empty)
The same problem is with the error message "Folder xxx does not exist."

 
3)The error message "Type name is empty" is not clear. If you look at the Class wizard dialog you see, that there is only one occurence of the "type" string.
Again you have to think for the first time something like this: Do they mean 
"Name:" Text? The better could be in my oppinion "Class name is empty." or even "Class name must not be empty."

1) is a small bug in my view.
2,3) are usability issues. "Do not make the user think about stupid things..." Make him think about his real problems not about the IDE.

Moving to JDT UI
1.) is not a bug but required by the Eclipse UI guidelines. No errors until the user makes a change.

2.) we can do that. 
3.) I think it is clear what type name means. No changes planed.

fixed 2.) > 20060321
