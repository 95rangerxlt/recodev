Two classes that reproduce the bug

Please refer to the attached java files to reproduce this:

When calling a method with a @Deprecated annotation from within a lambda method, the JDT core crashes with the following Exception:

eclipse.buildId=4.4.0.I20130630-1602
java.version=1.7.0_25
java.vendor=Oracle Corporation
BootLoader constants: OS=linux, ARCH=x86_64, WS=gtk, NL=en_US
Command-line arguments:  -os linux -ws gtk -arch x86_64


Error
Tue Jul 02 16:11:10 PDT 2013
Error in JDT Core during AST creation

java.lang.ClassCastException


Please note that this only happens if the deprecated method belongs to a different class than the one that contains the lambda.

Proposed Patch
Patch looks good, please release & resolve


Please also raise two follow up defects: 

(1) One against core that says
"Inspect all casts to and instance of checks for AbstractMethodDeclaration
to eliminate potential CCEs" (when the operand of cast/oinstanceof is MethodScope.referenceContext)

(2) One against JDT/Text: for the following program, why is one call
of callMe shown stricken out while the other is not ? 


public class X {
	{
		Y.callMe(); 
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Runnable r = () -> {
			Y.callMe();
		};
		System.out.println(r);
	}
}


// 

public class Y {
	@Deprecated
	public static void callMe() {}
}
