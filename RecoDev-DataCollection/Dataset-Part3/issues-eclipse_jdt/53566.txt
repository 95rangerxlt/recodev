When right clicking on a file which has a main method, in the package explorer,
the run submenu is available.  In this menu there is run and debug.  It would be
nice to have 'Create Run Entry...' which would create an entry in the run dialog
for the selected class.  From within this dialog, extended run information could
be provided (library.path info, etc), and would eliminate the need for the user
to manually create a run entry (finding the class, etc).

Small but useful.

Ah, no worries, just found it had been added to the run menu automagically on
run from context menu.
