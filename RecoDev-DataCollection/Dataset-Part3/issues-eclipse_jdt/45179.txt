when you are making batch refactor
you use some specifig kind of setting for it
like :
refactor -> rename
has following choices :
Update references to renamed classes (checked by default)
Update references in javadocs
Update references in regular comments
Update references in string literals
Update fully qualifed names in non Java file ( force preview )
 File name patterns : [               ] - this one is saved
all other are not, it would be a nice feature to save all thouse settings so 
there is no need to check all of them all the time

Agree
Fixed in I20031209: all checkboxes are saved when exiting the wizard via "OK".
