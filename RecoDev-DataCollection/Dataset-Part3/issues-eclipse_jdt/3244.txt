The class path is not saved using UTF8, contrary to the encoding it says it uses in its XML.
JavaProject.get/setSharedProperty do String<->byte[] conversions using the default encoding, not UTF8.
This should be fine if you know that you're always using ASCII only, and want it to be editable.
But then the XML should not claim it's in UTF8.

Fixed. Made the utf8 encoding explicit (was implicit before).
