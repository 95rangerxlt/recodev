Build Identifier: Eclipse 3.4.2 - Build Id: M20090211-1700

Using 3.4.2 Eclipse.

a) Navigate to Java Editor
b) Right Click using keyboard
c) Bug:  The "Preferences..." menu item is not having any accelerator.

Accelerator is required to meet accessibility. 
This issue also seen in other Eclipse editors like html editor. Right click these editors, one can see all the context menu having accelerators,but the menu item " Preferences..." does not have any accelerator attached to it.. 

I am not sure if this is by design or a bug. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to Java Editor
2. Right Click using keyboard in Java editor
3. Bug:  The "Preferences..." menu item is not having any accelerator.
