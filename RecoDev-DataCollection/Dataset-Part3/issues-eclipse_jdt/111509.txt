We are using internal jdt calls to perform some of our operations. We are using
EditorUtility.getActiveEditorJavaInput(..) and would like to replace it with
public api.

We couldn't find public API to replace this usage.

This is blocking our effort to remove access to JDT internal source.

This is an internal helper method with no internal JDT logic. No plans to make
this API. All that's in there is API and can be used by you in your own utility
class.
Thanks.
Reconsidering: it is not that easy and actually the code in EditorUtility.getActiveEditorJavaInput(...) using  IEditorInput.getAdapter(IJavaElement.class) to get the editor input as Java element has several problems, see bug 120340.
See JavaUI.getEditorInputJavaElement(IEditorInput).

Fixed in HEAD.
