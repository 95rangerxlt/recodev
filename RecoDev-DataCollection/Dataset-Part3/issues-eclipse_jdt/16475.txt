Run Eclipse in Debug mode.  When it get's to the point that it is waiting for 
Events on the UI thread, pause the Main thread in the debugger.  This usually 
causes the OS.java class to be opened.  On my Thinkpad, 1.133 GHz, this takes 
about 45 seconds.  To me this is an unacceptable time to open a resource.

which build? How are you opening the OS class, is it in source or binary.
On 20020519 it takes less than 2 seconds to open the OS class from the binary 
SWT project.

I was using an older build.  It's much faster now.
Note that if I close the Outline view I still get a speedup of about 5x.
