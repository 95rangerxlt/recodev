For unknown reasons, my content assist became unusably slow when I invoked it on a Composite and then started filtering the proposals:

    void m(Composite c) {
        c.|   // press Ctrl+Space here and then type "g"
    }

I took a performance trace in which I found that much of the time was burned in the type hierarchy computation triggered by ParameterGuessingProposal.computeReplacementString()

I think this has been introduced the fix for bug 188851.

I guess this is not the only cause of the slowness I see (I also have a heap > 180 MB with 1 open editor), but it's probably an important part.
- Composite is org.eclipse.swt.Composite.
- parameter guessing must be enabled

Fixed in HEAD.
