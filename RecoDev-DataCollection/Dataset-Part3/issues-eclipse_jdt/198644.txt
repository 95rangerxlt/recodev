Use Extract Class on org.eclipse.compare.CompareEditorInput with getters and setters on all fields as top level.
The resulting code will contain Errors because the type InternalOutlineViewerCreator is not visible for the extracted class.

Can you fix it?
It might become difficult to detect all cases where there will be a visibility problem. But I will look into it.

Shows message that the visibility is not sufficient
Given your test case:
1. Select 'PackageReferences'
2. Extract Class...
3. Destination: 'Nested class in PackageReferences'
4. OK
Is:
  1. Error is shown although result will not contain errors
  2. The result contains errors because 'import p.subPack.PackEx.OtherPackageProteced;' is added although import is not required
Should:
 Not warn and not add import

Just a detail, something like:

if (Modifier.isPrivate(typeBinding.getDeclaredModifiers())) {
  ...
}
if (Modifier.isProtected(typeBinding.getDeclaredModifiers())) {
  ...
}

can be written more efficient when written as:

int declModifiers= typeBinding.getDeclaredModifiers();
if (Modifier.isPrivate(declModifiers)) {
  ...
} else if (Modifier.isProtected(declModifiers)) {
  ...
}
