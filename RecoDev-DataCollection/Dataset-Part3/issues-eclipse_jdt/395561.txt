Steps to reproduce:
1. Invoke "Introduce Parameter Object" on 't' in code below
2. Choose "Destination" as "Top level class"
3. "Destination" class does not compile ("T cannot be resolved to a type")

interface IntroduceParameterObjectBug2<T> {
    // Invoke "Introduce Parameter Object" on 't', choose "Destination" as
    // "Top level class"
    void f(T t);
}
