When typing in a statement such as for(), when completion is enabled (so that 
the closing bracket is added automatically), an extra carriage return 
keystroke is sometimes required.

For example, type the following:

for(

Eclipse adds the closing bracket to complete the statement, and leaves the 
caret between the two brackets.

If you then cursor-right, to place the caret at the end of the statement and 
press Enter (carriage return), nothing happens. The caret does not move, and 
no new line is created.

If, instead of cursor-right, you type the closing bracket youself (overwriting 
the one Eclipse added) and press Enter (carriage-return), then a new line is 
created and the caret moves to it as you would expect.

When typing in a hurry, this is a real nuisance!

I don't know which Java preferences are relevant to help to reproduce this, 
but for reference, the Java|Editor|Typing preferences are all checked. Please 
ask if you need more info.

This occurs in Eclipse M6
