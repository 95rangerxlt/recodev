Steps to reproduce:
1. Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" in code below
2. Select "Nested Class in ..."
3. There is a compilation error in the resulting file ("Cannot make a static reference to the non-static type T")

class ExtractClassBug<T> {
    // Invoke "Extract Class..." on "m" (and specify "Nested Class in ...")
    T m;
}
