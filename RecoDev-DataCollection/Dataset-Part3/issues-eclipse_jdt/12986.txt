Creating a working copy of a compilation unit using getWorkingCopy
(progressMonitor, bufferFactory, problemRequestor) does not call any method on 
the problem requestor although the working copy's content must be parsed to 
determine its structure.

along an IProblemRequestor so as to benefit from it.
