The workbench will be adding a getPart() method to IViewSite. This will cause
compile errors in ViewSiteDecorator unless it adds a corresponding method. We
need this for a patch planned for M5.

Here's the code:

    /* (non-Javadoc)
     * @see org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPartSite#getPart()
     */
    public IWorkbenchPart getPart() {
        return fViewSite.getPart();
    }

patch for org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.util.ViewSiteDecorator

Here's a patch.
I have added the method, however its current implementation returns null to
avoid compile errors in JDT/UI land. Martin, can you please uncomment the
correct code after we have an integration build which provides the method
IViewSite#getPart().

Nick, may be it's the time now to reopen 49620 and to provide the decorator we
requested in 3.0 ;-).
