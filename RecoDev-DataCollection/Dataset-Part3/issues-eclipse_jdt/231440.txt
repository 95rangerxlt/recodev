Package names can already be abbreviated by abbreviating all parts of the name.

I propose to add an option to completely hide a prefix.

Example
===============================================
Prefix: "com.company.product"

Original: "com.company.product"
Abbreviated: "."

Original: "com.company.product.componentA"
Abbreviated: "componentA"

Original: "com.company.product.componentA.packageA"
Abbreviated: "componentA.packageA"

There is actually a similar functionality in JDT that might meet your needs.

1. Window > Preferences > Java > Appearance
2. Configure 'Compress all package name segments, except the final segment'.
Thanks. I know about the "Compress all package name segments, except the final segment" feature. However, if I am not mistaken, I can't use this to express something like the proposed feature.

Maybe we could even use normal regular expressions instead of those compression patterns: 

Original: "org.eclipse.jdt"

Abbreviated: "..jdt"
Compression pattern: "."
Regexp: "/[^.]+\././"

Abbreviated: "jdt"
Compression pattern: "0"
Regexp: "/[^.]+\.//"

Abbreviated: "org~.ecl~.jdt"
Compression pattern: "3~"
Regexp: "/([^.]{3})[^.]*\./$1~./"

Abbreviated: "eclipse.jdt"
Compression pattern: ?
Regexp: "/^org.//"
This is not an area with priority to us. Help in the form of a simple patch would be most welcome.

This can be done now with the new 'Abbreviate Package names' feature with a rule like
"com.company.product="
(note that the right hand side is blank)
