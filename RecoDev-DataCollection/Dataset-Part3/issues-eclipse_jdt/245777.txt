Method TypeContextChecker#appendTypeParameters fails to insert the closing '>'. 
When the result is passed to the parser (I observed this in
resolveSuperInterfaces) this unnecessarily requires syntax recovery to 
luckily get the intended result.

Can you please provide steps or a test case to reproduce the problem? Thanks.

Steps:

- Have:

import java.util.ArrayList;
public class MyList<Element> extends ArrayList<Element> {
    void m() {}
}

- Change Method Signature on m()

=> Content assist in the types fields only works because syntax recovery is good enough.

You were quicker than me :)

I had a scenario using the new class wizard for adding an inner
class of a parameterized class, but I guess any scenario using
the said method should qualify ...
Fixed in HEAD.
