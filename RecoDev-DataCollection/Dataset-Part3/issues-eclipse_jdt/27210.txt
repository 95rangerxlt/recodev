When I type "for" followed by CTRL-SPACE I can choose to produce the following 
Java fragment:

for (Iterator iter = collection.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
   type element = (type) iter.next();
}

When I select "type" and start typing both instances of "type" are replaced 
with what I type.

BUG: If I select "type" and CTRL-V (Paste), only the first "type" is replaced, 
which defeats the most optimal use of this feature, IMHO.
