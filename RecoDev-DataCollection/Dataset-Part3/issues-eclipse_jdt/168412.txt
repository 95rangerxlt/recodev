I have EMF in my classpath.  I open a nested, top-level class (EcoreUtil$Copier). When I invoke CTRL+O, I see the outline with only the class name shown.

Expectation is that the top-level treeitems should be expanded initially. Maybe it is being calculated as 2nd-level because of the filtered outer class.

Great, this one is actually not easy to reproduce as I had assumed.

PreReq:
A public static nested class loaded as binary w/src attached

Steps:
1) Create class extending Copier nested type
2) F3 on the superclass, opening EcoreUtil$Copier.class
3) CTRL+O.

TreeItem for the class is not expanded.

Type some characters to match method names, then CTRL+O starts working normally.
Can reproduce using 3.3 M4.
Fixed in HEAD.
