Fix for bug 31379 generates unique identifiers for declaring exception 
variables when surrounding with try/catch. But I just noticed that for the 
following snippet:

public void m1() {
  if (true)
    throw new Exception(); // compiler error
  if (true)
    throw new Exception(); // compiler error
}

quick-fixing with "Surround with try/catch" will use different identifiers in 
the generated "catch(Exception <id>)" clauses ("e" and "e1"). It shouldn't, 
because the declared exception variables are not in the same scope (there is 
no collision).
