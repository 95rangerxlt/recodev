It would be convenient if I could assign a keybinding to the
'Split variable declaration' and the 'Join variable declaration' quick assists.

Since they are never applicable at the same position, it would be nice if they could even get the same keybinding, e.g. named 'Split/Join variable declaration'.

I would prefer different keybindings. Simplifies the label.

Simplifies the label at the expense of an additional keybinding and the inability to bind these two disjointly active commands to the same keystroke. I don't think that's worth the "nicer" label.
