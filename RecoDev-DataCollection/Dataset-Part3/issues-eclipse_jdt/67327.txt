Method parameter code assist is not working when method parameters wrapped to 
more then one line. Ff I format the same code to one line, the code assist 
works.

Tested in RC3 Release and the problem is still there. This makes code inside for
method parameters vurtually not useable.

Any plans on fixing this bug?
So much new functionality is being released in 3.1 but some very annoying bugs
that affect developers productivity are not being addressed.

This was working before and got broken somewhere in the middle of 3.0 releases.
There are also many duplicates - people are bothered by it.

It actually never worked correctly because the JavaParameterListValidator is
line based: if you try it in 2.0 you'll see that as soon as you press left/right
arrow the parameter hint disappears. It only appeared initially in 2.0 due to a
bug which got fixed in 3.0: we forgot to do the initial validation.

I've now fixed the line-based implementation of JavaParameterListValidator and
now  the parameter hint also stays and updates when the left/right arrows are
pressed.

This present will be in the Xmas week I-build ;-)
Have tested it instantly. Small fix, great help  Thanks:)

Could you please commit that also to the 3.0 maintenance branch?
Thanks

This is not critical enough to be backported.
