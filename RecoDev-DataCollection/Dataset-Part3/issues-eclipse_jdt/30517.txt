In the newest build, the print margin does not seem to work correctly. When
ever I open a new Java-class by (for example) double-clicking it, the print
margin shows in a wrong position. In my case the Preferences->Java->editor
says 80, but the margin is drawed approximately to 60:th column. The problem
concernes only new windows; I can work around the problem by setting the
option "recycle windows" and for every window, open the
Preferences->Java->editor, unselect the option "Show pring margin", click
apply, select the option again and finally click the apply button again.
