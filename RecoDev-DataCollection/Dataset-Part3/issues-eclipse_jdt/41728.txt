I would like to be able to syntax highlight the operators in the java language
separately from the other elements i.e. things like "=","&","*","!", etc.

My motivation for this is partly poor eyesight - I keep not seeing the not 
operator ("!") and misreading if statements.

This is currently work in progress.
Tobias, please give more details.
