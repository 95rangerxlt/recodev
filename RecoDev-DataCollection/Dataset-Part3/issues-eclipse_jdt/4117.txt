Can't change the background color on the Java file editor

NOTES:

	MDL (8/16/2001 10:21:31 AM): This isn't really a problem on windows since the background color is white and easy to ready but the default on linux is grey and it is hard to read

EG (16.08.2001 19:02:27)
	The background color is not set by the Java file editor. The background color is set by the StyledText widget.
	Moving to SWT for comment.

SN (8/22/01 2:01:35 PM)
	Unless the background color is explicitly set, the default color scheme for the platform is used.
	This is the correct behavior.  On Linux, the color scheme you are using has gray as the background
	color.  SWT needs to honour the defaults.

	Is this a DCR for ITPJUI to allow the user to set the background color of the StyledText through the UI?

KR (8/24/01 2:34:25 PM)
	This is a color scheme problem. The user wants to customize the color scheme (in this case
	the background color for *just* the text widget). The only way to do this is to add UI for setting
	the background color for different types of widgets (e.g., text, lists, dialogs like in VAJ).

	It may be sufficient to enable users to easily set the background color of *all* widgets. On 
	Windows this is not the problem because you can use the control panel. On Linux you have to
	edit the XDefaults file for the application and figure out which widget class to use. With VAME 
	this was relatively easy because we used the platform text widget (XmText). Since StyledText 
	is subclassed from Composite you should be able to set the color using XmDrawingArea.
	However, MDL tried this and it doesn't work.
	So it's either up to ITPJUI to add GUI for changing background colors or SWT to figure out why
	StyledText isn't a XmDrawingArea and ITPRE to add doc that explains what to edit in the config file 
	and provide defaults like in VAME.
