Both Windows XP and Linux. I20020214 and previous.

Often my editor gets in a state where if I pop up code assist with Ctrl-Space
and press "Enter" to select the item from the list, the Enter causes a CR to be
inserted into the document, and code assist goes away. The only solution is to
close the editor and reopen. I've seen this a number of times on both windows
and linux but do not have accurate steps to reproduce.

I just experienced this problem on WinNT, as well.  Closing the editor and re-
opening seemed to fix the problem.  No relevant errors were present in the .log 
file.  I also tried pressing 'Ctrl-M' instead of Enter, and it had the same 
(incorrect) behaviour.

Indicates loss of short cut. Workbench used to have problems in this area which 
are marked as solved by now.
