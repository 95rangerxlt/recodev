Build ID: I20090803-1800

Steps To Reproduce:
                Integer value = 4711;
                double test = 47d;
                value = value + test; //Line3: Error

Line 3 is marked with a compilation error (Type mismatch: cannot convert from double to Integer) and one of the quick fixes suggest "Add a cast to
'Integer'". However, this is wrong and will not fix the compilation error as double to Integer cast is not allowed.
