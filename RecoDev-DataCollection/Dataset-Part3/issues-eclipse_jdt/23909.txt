In the Debug Variables View, the local variables have a nice 3-D looking diamond
icon.  The other icons in that view (for public, protected, private, etc.) have
a flat look that doesn't match or look as nice.  What about updating the these
icons to match the look of the local variable icon?

Darin, please have a look at comment #25
The local variables icon is indeed inconsistent with the other icons. However, 
rather than changing all the other icons we should make this icon consistent.
The icon used for local Java variables is the debug UI's generic variable icon 
that is used when an icon is not provided by a debug model presentation. I 
believe this icon was used in other WS* products (so we inherited it). However, 
the workaround (which I consider very low priority) is to have the java model 
presentation provide a different icon for local variables (rather than 
inheriting from the debug platform).
Please add any new icons requests to the icon request bug 36500 for 3.0
