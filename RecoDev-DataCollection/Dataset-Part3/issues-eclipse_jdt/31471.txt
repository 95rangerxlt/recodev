It is no longer the case that the package explorer automatically synchronizes to
the current text editor. There doesn't seem to be a preference to bring back
this occasionally very handy behavior.

This wouldn't be a problem if it were possible to bind a keystroke to "Show In
Package Explorer", but it doesn't seem to be possible. Every attempt to bind
this action to a keystroke in the keystroke assignment pref pane results in...
no response to the assigned keystroke. Alt-shift-s followed by return is one
keystroke too many, IMHO, though it does work.

Also, "Show in Package Explorer" has disappeared from the list of options when 
you right click a class name in the editor. (Using M5 build.)

This problem also appears on Win98 and Linux GTK. Build id: 200302061700
both showin package explorer and back linking are back since RC1.
In RC2, the "show in package" command is back on the popup menu, and binding to 
a key also works.

However, there still is no automatic synchronization to the current text editor 
as in previous builds.  Is this intentional?  Is there a preference to turn 
this back on?
At least in RC1, there was a icon in the title bar of the Package Explorer 
that would do the automatic synchronization when pushed in.

It looks a bit like this:

Yep, that's what I was missing.  Thanks!
