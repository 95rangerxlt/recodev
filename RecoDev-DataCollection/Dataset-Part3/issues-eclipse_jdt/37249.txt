Version: 2.1.0
Build id: 200303272130

I had a bogus path to javadoc.exe in Preferences/Java/Javadoc. When I clicked
Finish in the Export/Javadoc wizard, nothing happened. I gave up using the
feature until today when I ran accross my bad Preference setting. 

Obviously, the wizard needed to give the user some kind of error message. 

(FYI, this happened when I upgraded my set up from Sun's 1.4.1_01 to 1.4.1_02.)

Move to JDT/UI.
Martin, an error message would be indeed nice.
We should add a 'configure javadoc command' button on the top of the first page
that would open the preference page that configures the javadoc location.
Created attachment 6480
Remove the first page, add configure button to the second one.
Created attachment 6488
Remove the first page, add configure button to the second, perform checks whether file exists.
