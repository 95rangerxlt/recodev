	I need the flag constants from IConstants.
	'Flags' just allows to test for flags, but if I have to return a set of flags I can't do this.

	Can you explain better what it is you want to do exactly ? Surfacing the constants would make the class Flags redundant.

	The TypePage page (base class to create NewClass and newInterfaceWizards (and more)) has an API where you can
	get the flags configured by the user. I thought it would be best if I would invent new flags but take the constants from
	the compiler, so that Flags can be used to test.

	I would suggest to add the constants to Flags. Flags is still very helpful, 'Flags.isStatic' is much nicer/readable that \\
	'if (flags & Flags.ACC_STATIC != 0)'

PRODUCT VERSION:

Constants got added onto Flags.
Fixed.
