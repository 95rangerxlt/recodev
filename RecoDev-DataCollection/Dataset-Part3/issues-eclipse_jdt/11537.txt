In a method, given this:

    return fMyField.getArrayOfFoo()

where the method getArrayOfFoo has a return type of Foo[], 
if I use extract local variable to extract "fMyField.getArrayOfFoo()"
into a local variable "foos", it adds an (incorrect) import in the format

    import myPackage.Foo[];

Note that the array brackets should not appear in the import statement.
Also note that in my case, the imports already included an import
for the type "myPackage.Foo"... if that matters when trying to reproduce it.
