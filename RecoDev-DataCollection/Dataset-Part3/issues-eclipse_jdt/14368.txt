1. Create a class C as follow:

package jp1;

public class C {
	private int id;
}

2. Close it and mark it as read only
3. Reopen it and you should not be able to modify anything
4. From the outline view, select "id - int" and right mouse click and 
select "Create getter and setter".
5. The class becomes

package jp1;

public class C {
	private int id;
	/**
	 * Gets the id.
	 * @return Returns a int
	 */
	public int getId() {
		return id;
	}

	/**
	 * Sets the id.
	 * @param id The id to set
	 */
	public void setId(int id) {
		this.id = id;
	}

}

   and the editor is dirty, but you cannot save it until clear the read-only 
flag.

all our code generation actions do not honor the read only state:
- AddJavaDoc
- Override Method
- Add import
- Organize imports

Consult with Kai first with regard to the proper validateEdit interaction.
