Build Identifier: 

When adding a jar to a user library, you are give the dialog for selecting a file with an external path.

When attaching the source attachment or native library location you can select either an external path or a workspace path.

It would be useful to also be able to specify the jar location as a workspace path, which would aid in sharing projects with other people.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open preferences, navigate to Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries
2. Click New, and enter a name for the User Library.
3. Click "Add JARs", note the dialog type.
4. Select the "Native libary location" element, click "Edit".
5. Note the dialog type which allows for choosing an External Folder or Workspace path.

Workspace paths are already supported (bug 133191), but you currently have to find them with the OS chooser.

Could do something like in Java Build Path > Libraries, i.e. have "Add JARs..." and "Add External JARs...".
