Delete and Copy context menu options in Project Explorer get disabled for a project on deselecting "Resource" contents

1. Create a normal project without any facet applied
(File->New->Project... and selecting General->Project)

2. Right click on the Project in the Project Explorer: 
   Observe that the Delete Menu is visible

3. Select: Project Explorer->Customize View->Content  

4. Deselect: Resources.                  

5. Right click on the Project in the Project Explorer: 
Observe that the Delete and Copy Menu is no longer visible

Note: This issue doesn't occur with Java Projects.

I can reproduce it. It seems that Java Elements navigator content may be interfering here since a standard project should not be visible when Resources navigator content is unchecked.
Dani, can you please verify if my understanding in comment 1 is correct?
You explicitly disabled the resource specific extensions, hence what you see is expected.
I had an offline chat with Dani about this issue and the actual bug is that non-Java project is shown if Resource content is disabled. The reason is that Java Elements content shows all projects but should show only Java projects.

Comment on attachment 242047
Fix proposal

The fix is not complete:
- it does not deal with closed projects
- it misses other areas in the code where the root projects are requested
Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=61ea1c83ee5a0ebb54e53f5269fda74c07951e1e


There's a similar problem when in working set mode and 'Resources' is disabled, but this is harder to fix. If you really think this is important then please file a bug against Platform UI (org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.workingsets.WorkingSetsContentProvider).
I think the closed project case is arguable. Consider two scenarios assuming Resources content provider is disabled:

1) A project is closed. At this moment we really don't know its type. Project Explorer shows the project, but as soon as we open it, it disappears from the view without giving any hint why.
2) A Java project is open. Project Explorer shows the project, as soon as we close the project, it disappears from the view.

I think 1) is worse than 2) for end users. It will be hard to explain why Java content provider thinks it can handle closed projects. I think a content provider should show only projects that it can definitely handle and skip those that it doesn't handle or can't determine whether project is supported or not. In case of 2), it's easier to explain because when project is closed, we can't determine if it's supported so we shouldn't make any false assumptions. That seems more intuitive, especially that a closed project is nothing more than an IProject so it should be shown only by Resources content provider.

No, it does not.

Case 1 is exactly what the user wanted: don't show resources. It would be even more strange, if the project stayed and then after closing and reopening the Project Explorer it's gone.

This is how I think it should work, not the way it is working now.

I don't follow. Can you explain what kind of scenario do you have in mind?

No. Now it behaves like in the Package Explorer.

1. open a closed resource project and don't remove it
2. close Project Explorer
3. open Project Explorer
==> previously seen resource project vanished

Right. My understanding is that Project Explorer is a common view for many content providers so it doesn't need to behave as Package Explorer which is a dedicated view and can provide more tailored behavior.

Package Explorer behaves as a kind of "merge" of Resources and Java content providers from Project Explorer, so if Resources is disabled, I'd say it is fine if behavior is slightly different in Project Explorer.

Adjusting common view's behavior to match the behavior of a dedicated view doesn't sound good to me, especially if others would start doing the same, but I can understand that's what you prefer in this case.

I guess this could happen only if Project Explorer was updated between closing and reopening the view. This could be confusing and somewhat unexpected, but still easier to explain that it was a bug to show that project in the first place.

No. If, the closed project is reopened and then left in the Project Explorer, it will be filtered out after close and reopen. Nothing is needed in between.
(In reply to Dani Megert from comment #14)

I'm sorry but I still don't understand this scenario.

If the closed project is reopened, it should not be shown in Project Explorer if it's not a Java project (after your fix is already applied).

> it will be filtered out after close and reopen.

It could be only a Java project, so it should not be filtered out after closing and reopening the view.

Let me show you what I mean in the code: instead of 

if (!project.isOpen() || isJavaProject(project))

I'd write

if (project.isOpen() && isJavaProject(project))

to achieve the behavior that I'd expect. Can you please give it a try against the scenario that I still don't understand and let me know what you see?

Exactly! And that's what happens.

My point is that I'd expect closed projects are also not shown but at the moment they are shown.

And that will stay so.
