Follow as closly as possible to rename steps in the smoke test.:

1)Rename junit.framework.Test to A
2)select preview

Notice that though there are many changes made the window only one line with a 
scroll bar. Underneath there is a message 'no preview available' and a ton of 
space that could be used to show some of the information above.
This looks bad.
