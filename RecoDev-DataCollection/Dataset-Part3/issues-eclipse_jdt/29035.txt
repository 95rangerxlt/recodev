From Daniel Megert in Bug 28151

Build 20021210

The Packages view in hierarchical mode does no longer show logical packages 
when
selecting project "org.eclipse.jdt.ui" (in source).

Note: It used to work up to 20021204.

Test Case:
1. Enable CVS decorators.
2. Load org.eclipse.jdt.ui from CVS
3. Open Java Browsing perspective
4. Set the Packages view layout to hierarchical
5. Select the project "org.eclipse.jdt.ui" in the Projects view

We checked the decorators and the element for org.eclipse.jdt,ui is an 
instance of PackageFragment now so it is sending us what it thinks is the 
correct image.

This used to work before the new lightweight decorators were introduced.
Also Search view and others (see bug 28151) seem to be broken by these changes.

Waiting for final comments in bug 28151

Has been fixed a while ago.
