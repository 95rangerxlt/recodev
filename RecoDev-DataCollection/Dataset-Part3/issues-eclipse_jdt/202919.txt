R3.3 + I200700904-0800.

I cannot find the annotationProcessorFactory extension point in the Help:
JDT Plug-in Developer Guide > Reference > Extension Points Reference

Also: it's a bit strange that APT APIs have a special node:
# API Reference
# APT API Reference
It should just be added to "API Reference"

I think Sonia put the APT API in a separate category because it was generated by javadoc 1.5, rather than javadoc 1.4, and thus it has a separate overview-summary.html.  I assume that is still the case, so this cannot be combined yet.

I will add doc for the annotationProcessorFactory extension to the Extension Points Reference.
Fixed for 3.4M2.
