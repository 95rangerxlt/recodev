Patch v0.5

Basic implementation - needs quite a bit of polish.
Fix and tests released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=2b6b723d87be49aecbb1b89e893d389af560ea10.

I had to disable 9 tests that require code generation for instance and
outer locals capture which is not yet in place (see bug 405068) via:

These will be reenabled after bug 405068 is fixed.
