Build 20040219

I defined a template to map 'nls' to '//$NON-NLS-1$'
In a code line where 2 string literals occur, I completed on nls first and 
inserted the template. Then right behind it (after one space) I tried again to 
complete on nls, and this time it did not work anymore.

This used to be working fine before.

JavaSourceViewerConfiguration#getContentAssistant: 

Previous to 1.78, the java completion processor would be installed on
single-line comments as well, but with spell-checking, we install the
spell-checker completion processor over it.
