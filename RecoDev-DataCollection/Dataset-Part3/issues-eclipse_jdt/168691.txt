3.3 M4

I often have snippets in bug reports that do not compile. In such situations the pasting source feature simply gives up with an error dialog. It should handle such scenarios gracefully.

Try this:
------------%<--------------
class Test {
  /** !!! this line breaks it !!!
  void foo() {
    doSomething();
  }
}
------------%<--------------

If users supply code snippets with syntax errors like in comment 0, the correct fix is to close the bug as INVALID >:-/

But since I'm in a good mood today, I fixed it in HEAD (for situations where ASTParser with statements recovery can find a type declaration).
