Class A is super-class of class B.
Method m of B is inherited from A.

public class A {
    public void m(C c) {
    }
}

public class B extends A {
    @Override
    public void m(C c) {
    }
}

When method m of B is moved to class C (making delegate of m),
"@Override" annotation is also moved to C.

public class C {
    @Override             //error
    public void m() {
    }
}

The patch looks fine. Please attach an updated patch after pulling the latest code from master branch. 
Also, remove the FQN for Annotation and use the import. 
Add null check for type binding.

Hello Noopur, I am not sure what you mean by that last sentence. Which import are you referring to?

Use the import statement "import org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.Annotation;" instead of the FQN org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.Annotation in the code:

org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.Annotation annotation = ((org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.Annotation)extended);

Also, follow the JDT UI coding convention to use the compact assignment form (a= b, i.e. no space on the left of equals).
