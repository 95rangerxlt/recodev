Srikanth, would you prefer a new umbrella bug for all the AST rewrite bugs or can I just add a new dependency to the bug 391847 ?

Proposed fix

Markus, can you please review this (after fix for bug 391893 is out) ?

This requires complete rewrite since receiver is no longer SVD but now split into RECEIVER_TYPE and RECEIVER_QUALIFIER. I am on it.

Just so the priorities are clear: DOM/AST & ASTRewrite work is much higher
priority than (insofar as they would "unblock" the UI team and allow them
to join the Java 8 project work) stray/standalone compiler ERs like
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=399780 - Jay, I can help
with reassigning the compiler bug to someone else enabling you to focus
on AST API items. Let me know your thoughts.

Updated patch

Rewritten patch with tests.

The last test in ASTRewritingMethodDeclTest is failing because the formatter is inserting a new line after annotations for annotatable types. I don't know if there is a quick fix for this. Or should we revisit this when we work on the formtter?

Please disable the test, raise a follow up bug and assign it to Jesper
and mention the disabled test name in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383608 and request Jesper to update the list when fixed and reenabled.

Perhaps this is the same as https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=401848 ?

Indeed, it is.
Modulo bugs, this is the last work item to complete ASTRewrite work for 308.
When this gets reviewed and released, we can also resolve bug 398940

Spoke too soon. Bug 400650 is wrongly parented (fixed.) but that bug is about
adding tests, so yes effectively we will be complete with functionality that
can be consumed with the resolution of the present bug.

One issue found, more of a converter issue rather than ASTRewrite, raised bug 403132.

Continuing on the review:

 - Line 1877:
} else {
rewriteRequiredNode(method, MethodDeclaration.RECEIVER_TYPE_PROPERTY);
					rewriteQualifier = true;
}


- three additional test scenarios need to be implemented to achieve full statement coverage: 
a)
Pressed tab too soon.. comment incomplete. Please find the comments below:

1) - Line 1877:
} else {
 rewriteRequiredNode(method, MethodDeclaration.RECEIVER_TYPE_PROPERTY);				
 rewriteQualifier = true;
}
Is there a scenario (with the current list constants in Rewrite) that will cause this code to be touched? If yes, we need a test case here.

2) Line 1894 - block - A test case missing that touches this part of the code.

3) Line 1901 - Same as above.

Otherwise the patch looks good. Will review the patch again if changes due to the fix in bug 403132 has a code change here.

I had added that code to handle the children changed event for the receiver type. But looks like it's handled already by the code right below it where we enable rewriteQualifier in the presence of receiver type. So, I have removed that block of code. I have added new tests for the other two blocks you pointed out.

I have also removed some unnecessary white space from the tests in this patch.

And this would be the patch with the updates I just mentioned above.
Some rewrite tests will fail if run without the patch on bug 403132, comment #7.

This is fixed, Markus, Manoj has finished one round of review. So the ball is
in your court. TIA.
In ASTRewriteAnalyzer#rewriteModifiers2(..), I think it's time to introduce a new local variable and use it in all 3 places that do the same check:

boolean isAnnotationsProperty =
	property == SingleVariableDeclaration.VARARGS_ANNOTATIONS_PROPERTY 
	|| node instanceof AnnotatableType && property == ((AnnotatableType) node).getAnnotationsProperty();

The property check I added may currently not be necessary, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit, since we never know how the AST will evolve.

In ASTRewriteAnalyzer#visit(MethodDeclaration), the scan for TerminalTokens.TokenNameLPAREN better stays in that method, rather than being moved to rewriteMethodReceiver(..)

In ASTRewriteAnalyzer#rewriteMethodReceiver(..), there's a space too much in front of a " doTextInsert(" invocation and after a "offset= ".


The ASTRewritingMethodDeclTest still contained a sysout. Furthermore, it looks like you did some experiments with strange spacing. These should be reverted for the commit. Our official policy regarding badly-formatted code is "garbage in -> garbage out", so we don't need any tests for that situation. But we do need tests for the default code formatter settings.

Fixed these things and pushed as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?id=da439c42c3c777a1dd6611e64418ac2f9b27b690
Manju found that ASTRewriteFlattener#visit(MethodDeclaration) also needs to be updated. She's working on a patch.

Patch for ASTRewriteFlattener

Included handling of receiver parameter in ASTRewriteFlattener#visit(MethodDeclaration). Will upload a test case for this one as soon as it is complete.
Comment on attachment 229564
Patch for ASTRewriteFlattener

ASTRewriteFlattener needs to use getChildNode(..) and getChildList(..) to get the right nodes, see all other code in that class.

Patch for ASTRewriteFlattener

Thanks Markus. I have now used getChildNode and getChildList to retrieve data from the ASTNode.

Tests Patch

Added two test cases in ASTRewritingMethodDeclTest for the handling of receiver parameter.
Thanks Manju. Released comment 24 and comment 25 as http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?id=aade06a7dde9bdd68930bb7332e79ee5b41e5db9

I clarified the buf.append(...) by putting each "\n" on a separate line, and I simplified the initialization of "TypeDeclaration inner" (there's no need to iterate over bodyDeclarations() if we know that the inner type is at index 1).

Sorry, I forgot to set Manju as Git Author.
