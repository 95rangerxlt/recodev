"Another area where [Eclipse] is slow is in code completion. I have to wait so
long for the little box to pop-up on its own that I usually either skip it or
press ctrl-space to force it to open."
[Excerpted from http://www.netbeans.org/switch/realstories.html]

Suggest changing the default delay to 100 (ms).

this is a preference
Sorry. You asked to change the default. Do you think this makes the difference
or is it rather a problem that people don't know about the preference?
Yes, the defaults do make a difference. Pascal and Mike M were having a
discussion about better out of the box settings, and Mike asked for some more
examples. This is one that I always adjust myself and recommend others do too.
Default memory size is another one (vm option) but I believe there's already an
entry for that.

Changed title to say 'default'.

Ed, what value do you use?

100ms (1/10 second)
Playing devil's advocate here...

Is there a disadvantage to having a shorter delay?  Will a short delay get in
the way of typing?  Will constantly bringing up the code completion window have
a performance impact wrt editor responsiveness?  Will it be more noticable on
slower machines or the Mac?
I've set it to 200ms because 100ms is a bit too small for cases where you want
to type without code assist coming up.

Fixed in HEAD.
Available in builds >= I20050509-1200.

That's a good compromise and much better than 500ms, thanks.
