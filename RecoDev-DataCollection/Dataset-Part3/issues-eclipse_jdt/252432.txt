When jar are referenced in the Class-Path: clause of the MANIFEST.MF file, they end up being displayed with the name of the jar that referenced them.
This is far from being ideal as it is difficult to distinguish them.

This has been fixed by bug 252591.

Keeping this bug for further improvements, e.g. an appendix that tells the first JAR from whose "Class-Path:" entry in the manifest this JAR is referenced:

a.jar - referenced by aref.jar
