Problem Description
-------------------
I separate my workspaces and codelines.  In other words, my actual code and corresponding projects do not live directly in the workspace directory.  Eclipse 3.2 allows the complete creation of a Java project outside the workspace.  "Complete creation" means automatically specifying the pre-configured source directory (e.g., "src/java") and properly assigning the JRE System library to the project.  Eclipse 3.3 does not seem to allow this.  It creates the project structure outside the workspace, but does not automatically specify the pre-configured source directory and more importantly fails to assign the JRE System library.

Steps to Reproduce
------------------
1. Create a Java project (junk-3.3) that will not live directly in the workspace.

2. Choose the "Create project from existing source" option.  In my environment, there is no directory called "junk-3.3".
 
3. Outside the workspace directory, create the junk-3.3 directory by pressing "Make New Folder."

4. Verify the fully qualified path in the Directory text box does not live under the workspace directory.

5. Press next.  Normally my configured source folder "src/java" would appear under junk-3.3.  It does not.  However, my configured default output folder "ide-build" does automatically appear (I did not change it for this example).

6. Add "src/java" manually.  Again, normally this would have been done automatically.  If I don't add the source folder here, it doesn't get added to the project.

7. Press finish.  The JRE System Library /is not added/ automatically.  I have to add it manually.

8. Create a new project that will live in the workspace.

9. Press next.  In my case, the pre-configured "src/java" source folder automatically appears, as well as the default output folder ("ide-build").

10. The project is created.  The JRE System Library /is added/ automatically.

Shows the steps to reproduce the problem.
Looks like a bug. The folder exists but is empty. We should set up a default project then.
As sson as it is not empty, we will try to detect source folders in it. The JRE should always be added.
It's e regression, works in 3.2.2. Got introduced by fix for Bug 153173
Mmm, this was the wrong fix in 3.2. We need to delete every created resource on cancel. This would allow to create the default src folder if non exists on next. Would also fix Bug 189638
If I create the source folder on next then I must also delete it again on cancel.
