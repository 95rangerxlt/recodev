3.1 M4

I'm used to be able to use all my working sets everywhere i.e. in Navigator,
Package Explorer, Java Browsing views and of course for searching. This is now
broken. Even worse, it also gets lost in the Package Explorer: assume I worked
for a while in the working set mode and have all my stuff collected in the
History working set. I know decide to switch to projects and there, select the
History working set but hey: it's gone. This is very surprising.

Note: I even tended to mark this one as major since it breaks my conceptual
model of working sets.

I am not a fan of making the Histroy working set global. Making something like
the history working set global requires some coordination with Platform/UI to
answer questions like:

- what will be the name of such a working set. Favorits ? with the option to
  add saved file automatically

- what is the relation to the bookmarks view/story.

I agree that the history working set shouldn't be updated when not in working
set mode. I will fix this to avoid further confusion.
Histroy working set got removed.
