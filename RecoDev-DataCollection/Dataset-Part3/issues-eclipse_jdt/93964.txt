Build input for I200506-1600

I disabled the failing test case NewForLoopJavaContextTest.testInnerArray() for
the build.

Expected:
	for (Inner inner : array) {
		
	}

Was:
	for (A.Inner inner : array) {
		
	}

What's the particular reason of hiding this problem from the build? Are you sure
this is a JDT Text and not a JDT Core problem?

I've reactivated the test so that the problem gets reported as such.

The reason for the failure was that CodeComplete does not return the CU-local
types any longer for zero-length prefixes. We now note get the local types from
the CU before doing any guesswork.
