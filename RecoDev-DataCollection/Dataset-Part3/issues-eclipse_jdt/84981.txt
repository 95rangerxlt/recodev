It seems that the DefaultHyperlinkPresenter does not unregister on IDocuments

1. set 'reuse editors' in search
2. create some search matches and step through
3. TextSelectionNavigationLocation still holds on document (will file bug for that)
4. documents still have a DefaultHyperlinkPresenter as listener
