PackageExplorerPart.saveExpansionState should be changed to use 
getVisibleExpandedElements() instead of getExpandedElements().
This is a huge startup performance win, and is low risk.
Without it, performance bogs down the more items have been expanded, even 
across shutdown and restart.
These extra items also have to get decorated, which is expensive for CVS and 
ClearCase decorators.

Note that the Navigator has been using getVisibleExpandedElements() for several 
drops, with no problems.
