The 'typecomment' template has the following default value:

/**
 * @version 	1.0
 * @author
 */

The 'filecomment' template has the following default value:

/*
 * (c) Copyright 2001 MyCorporation.
 * All Rights Reserved.
 */

Both of these templates are on by default. This leads to
the Java editor adding inappropriate comments to every source
file generated.

Recommended behavior:
(1) The default 'typecomment' template should be completely empty.
(2) The default 'filecomment' template should be completely empty.
(3) Both templates should be on by default. With empty templates,
bogus class javadoc and file header comments will be not generated.

This means that a user that actually changes these templates to
have suitable values will automatically reap the benefits.

agreed, a must fix  (the "Generated by VisualAge/Java" comments are still in 
fresh memory...)

you'll need to restore defaults in the template preference page to update those 
templates.
