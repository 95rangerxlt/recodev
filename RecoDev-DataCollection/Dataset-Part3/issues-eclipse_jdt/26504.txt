inactive changes get performed
problem should be fixed in CompositeChange or TextChange
Dirk, can you have a look?
TextFileChange is what i meant
It seems that the files didn't get changed. They are only touched. And it seems 
that this only happens if the files are under version control and only Inline 
constant seems to be effected.
Same happens for Inline Method.
Problem is that we called save even so the change was inactive. I guess that 
something in the save sematic has changed (may be in the past they optimzed non 
dirty cases).

Anyway, fixed it for build > I20021119.
