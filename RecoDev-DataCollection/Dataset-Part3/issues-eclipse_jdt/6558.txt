When there are missing class path entries for a Java Projects the properties 
dialog informs the user of this as a message rather than an error. As the text 
does not stand out this is not obvious.

STEPS
1) Load in org.eclipse.ui from CVS
2) Select Convert to PDE project
3) Open up the Properties page on the project
4) Select Java Build Path - "Class path entries are missing" is shown as a 
message

now tthat we have the new class path variable initializer we could change the 
error severity (I know that I've argued against it previously...)
We should promote them as errors.
Severity changed.
Fixed
