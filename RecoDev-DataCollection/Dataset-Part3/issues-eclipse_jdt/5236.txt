A preference to disable the auto code assist would be nice.
Alternatively there could be a timer controlling how fast the
code assist pops up.

See also Bug 4982. I find this behaviour a serious impediment to work; I would 
suggest the default of such a preference should be off.
I would also like a way to turn off the auto code assist.  Like JM, it impedes 
my work at times.  I am not a big code assist person in the first place and now 
it's always in my way.  Just another vote for this in hopes that this will be 
fixed sooner than later...
