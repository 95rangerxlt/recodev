When I am extracting a local variable from a trivial/literal expression,
e.g. true, 100, ... 
I do NOT want to replace occurrences of that expression,
because the next expression e.g. true may have a 
totally independent/orthogonal semantic and value.

In all other cases (complex expressions) the current default is o.k.

best regards

Makes sense to disable the 'find occurences in other expressions' when a literal
is selected 
We shouldn't diable the check box, but the default in this case should be 
unchecked.
I agree with Dirk! Don't disable check box only uncheck it!
Fixed in builds > 20040223.

The default is now not to replace occurrences of base type literals
(boolean, char, and numbers).
This is changed in Extract Local Variable, Extract Constant, and Extract Method.

that sort of defeats the very purpose of extract constant, doesn't it? :)
