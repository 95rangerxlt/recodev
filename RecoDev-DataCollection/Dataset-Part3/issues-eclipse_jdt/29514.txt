whenever I CTRL-F3 (Open Structure) on a readonly java file, I get
an error message "This file cannot be edited. ..."
Also the same problem appears when using CTRL-O
When I press CTRL-F (Find/Replace) on a readonly file to find a specific 
string, a message box pops up saying "This file cannot be edited ...". When I 
press OK on the box the Find/Replace dialog appears.
Fixed Find/Replace and Ctrl-O. Cannot reproduce F3 on I20030128.
