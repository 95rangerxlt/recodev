ListDialog is API and for some reason JDT has two copies of the class for redundancy :)

Here's a stab at it.
How about M6 :D?
The patch looks simple BUT: I did a quick comparison of the three ListDialog
classes and there are many diffs. In addition, one of the two in JDT dialogs has sets the WRAP style bit for its message.

Sorry, but most likely we will not have time to look into this as we have to review all the three classes and test that everything still works the same.

Patch is not good as it alters the message area of one of the two dialogs.
Fixed in HEAD.
