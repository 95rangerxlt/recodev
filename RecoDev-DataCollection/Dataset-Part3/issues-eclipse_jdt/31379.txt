Surround with try/catch should avoid collision with existing identifiers when 
declaring the catch-block variable.

For the following code snippet:

	try {
		throw new Exception();
	} catch (Exception e) {
		throw new Exception();  // <<== problem marker
	}    

When accepting the quick-fix suggested for the problematic line, the following 
code results:

	try {
		throw new Exception();
	} catch (Exception e) {
		try {
			throw new Exception();
		} catch (Exception e) { // <<== problem marker
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}   

Now there is a compiler error in the inner catch: "Duplicate argument e".

We could leverage the support we have in inline method to compute unique method 
names.
Fixed for RC1.
