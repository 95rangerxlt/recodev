In the javadoc of the class org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.MethodDeclaration, in the
JLS3 section, the type parameters are missing inside the definition of a

Changed grammar rule in class comment, and spec for 
MethodDeclaration.typeParameters.

Updated release notes and released to HEAD.

(Since this only affects JLS3-level DOM API, which is nascent in 3.0, there is 
no point in releasing this particular change to 3.0.1.)
