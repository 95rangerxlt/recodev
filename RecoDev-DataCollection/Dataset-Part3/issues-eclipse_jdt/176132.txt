Some processors are slow.  It would be good to be able to set a flag to only run them at build time.

Note that a processor itself can pay attention to the build phase (reconcile/build); but it cannot do something clever like only generating code during build.  This is because if a file is generated during build and then not during a subsequent reconcile, APT has no way of knowing whether that was the processor cleverly optimizing, or the processor indicating that the file is no longer supposed to be generated.

The reason I'm coding this as a "bug" rather than "enhancement" is that we've been telling people (in 3.2) to write processors that are smart that way.  It didn't matter, because we weren't generating types on reconcile anyhow, so we weren't deleting them either.  But now we are, in 3.3.

The most basic version of this is to put a flag on the project settings: e.g., under "enable annotation processing" put a secondary checkbox labeled "only run processors during builds".

Embellishments might include:

1. Instead of doing it per-project, put it in the Advanced options on each factory container, like we do for batch mode at present.

2. Also have (either at project or factory level) an "only generate files during builds" button.  Note that this is only interesting if we think that file generation is slower or more error-prone than error checking; I am not sure that's really true.  I'd tend to vote against this option, myself.
As a first draft, I would go with the simplest option: "only run
processors during builds". If it turns out that there is demand for processors that check during reconcile and create files during build we can burn that bridge when we come to it.
I've added a new prefs node, and API for it in AptConfig.  I have also added a field to the APT config UI, and updated the help documentation.  And there's a new test in AptReconcileTests.
