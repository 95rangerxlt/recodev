I cannot make the (extremely good!) new code formatter do this
if (foo)
{
    xxxx
}
else
{
    yyyy
}
The old one allowed it.

same is true for 
try
{
}
catch()
{
}
actually there seems to be many bugs in the new formatter - should I be 
reporting them or is this still w-i-p
it is work in proress but please report bugs!
Did you select the insert new line in control statement option?
ok - that does it - not obviuos what is does - the helper text on the right 
doesnt show a good example (do/ while is pretty rare, if /else or try/catch 
would be better example).
Then move to JDT/UI to improve the code formatter preference page code snippet.

added a try/catch example > 20040225
