F3

- select a method in ouliner
- copy
- select CU
- paste
  observe: method has two trailing newlines. There should be only one.

May be this is a regression of the CodeFormatter fix

Adam pls investigate whether this is a regression. It is a fix candidate for F4.
the steps given were incorrect (you cannot paste a method over a cu)

heres are better steps:
1.creat this class
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void greeting(){
    }
    
    public static void greeting1(){
    }
}
2. select gretting()
3. copy
4. select gretting1()
5. paste

this is a bug but not a regression
i just checked - it was there in F1 too 
fixed
