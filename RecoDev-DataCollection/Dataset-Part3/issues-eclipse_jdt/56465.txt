The preference page for compiler compliance settings is missleading. Allthough 
they don't allow illegal combinations it is uncommon to change settings that 
are fixed in some states.

Example (from a posting):
----
3.0 M8 will not allow me to set "Compiler/Compliance and Classfiles/Source 
compatibility" to 1.4 when I have "Compiler Compliance Level" and "Source 
Compatibility" to 1.4 and "Disallow identifiers called 'assert'" to "ignore". 
The error I get is:

When source compatibility is 1.4, 'assert' cannot be an identifier.

This makes M8 completely unusable for me
since I have tons of asserts in all my code. Any workaround?

This is not a good UI. If the source compatibility is set to 1.4 
then "Disallow identifiers called 'assert'" should be automatically set 
to "error" and the control should be disabled to indicate that this setting is 
not changable when source compatibility is set to 1.4.

The current behavior confuses users (as seen above) and should be changed to a 
more smart behavior. We don't need to show error messages when we can solve 
them automatically.

good idea! the 'assert' combo is now disabled as set to 'ERROR' is 1.4 is selected
