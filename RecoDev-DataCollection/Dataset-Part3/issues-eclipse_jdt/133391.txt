Currently APT ignores "*" for interop and performance reasons. This is at odds with the commandline tool. Need to find a way to allow this behavior.

Perhaps APT could warn on the following situations:

1. Factory claims "*" in supportedAnnotationTypes()
2. Additional processors do not get dispatched because a different processor claimed "*".

Fixed in HEAD. We now allow "*", but log a warning when this occurs.
