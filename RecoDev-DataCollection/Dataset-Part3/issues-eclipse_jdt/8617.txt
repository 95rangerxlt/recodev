The icon for 'Show the Type Hierarchy' in the Hierarchy view is confusing and 
misleading.  It seems to indicate that siblings of the focused class will be 
shown in the view, but that is incorrect.

It looks like:

o       << presumably this is a superclass
|-O     << this node is green, presumably the focused class
| |-o   << presumably this is a subclass of the focused class
|
|-o     << what's this??

this point is valide. 
Suggest to move "what is this" node as another child of the focused class.

Also the grey and color icons are not properly aligned the icon contents moves 
when hovering over.
