It would be really nice to have the Extract Interface refactoring implemented. 
I find that I want this a lot as I go back to generalize a concrete class and 
make it more general.

I see the UI as being:

1. From anywhere in the class, select Refactor -> Extract Interface.

2. A dialog pops up that is similar to the New Interface dialog. In addition, 
it has a list of checkboxes for each of the methods in the current class, 
allowing the user to select the methods that should be extracted as part of the 
interface.

3. When the user selects the methods and names the new interface (including 
selecting its package), the new interface is created appropriately and the 
original class is modified to implement the interface (including the addition 
of any import statements, etc.).
