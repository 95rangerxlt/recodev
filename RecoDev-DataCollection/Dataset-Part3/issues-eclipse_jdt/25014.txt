Version: 2.0
Build id: 200210161553 

The JUnit TestCase wizard accepts empty string as the test case name when there 
is no Java class currently selected.

Steps for reproducing the error:

1 - Ensure there is no class currently selected in the Package Explorer (e.g. 
select a package or project);

2 - Activate New JUnit TestCase wizard;

3 - There will be no test case name selected. The "Finish" button will be 
disabled. Then erase the "Superclass" field content. The "Finish" button will 
be enabled. 

This opens a dialog with a message "Creation of element failed. Reason: Invalid 
name specified: .java" and a new entry is added to the error log. 

The stack trace will be attached.
