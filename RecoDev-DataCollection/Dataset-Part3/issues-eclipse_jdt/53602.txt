Current dialogs for getters/setters and constructor generation aren't easy to use.
First, I think that these dialogs should be constructed so that their primary
mode of interaction is through keyboard. A first step would be to assign them a
keyboard shortcut by default.
Ideally, I should have nothing more to perform than select which methods I want
to generate. Currently there is no problem to do that using the keyboard. But:
- I don't want to generate Javadoc for these methods. It is nice to have an
option to disable it, but it is not remembered between invocations of the dialog
(using 3.0M7). And changing this setting with keyboard is cumbersome, as I have
to tab through many widgets.
- I whish I could generate these methods at cursor position, without having to
choose neighbour methods in a combo (see bug 49585). Moreover, the insertion
point setting is remembered between invocations of the dialogs, and it is shared
between the getters/setters generation dialog and the constructor generation
dialog! I always have to manually change the insertion point.
- See also bug 53601 about unifying both constructor generation dialogs.

- stored settngs are now shared only by either all constructor dialogs or all
method dialgs
- generate comments is now remembered (before it was always taken from the pref
page)
- When opening from the editor on a cursor position you have a new location
'cursor position'

- and a new feature is that you can create getter/setters using code assist.
between methods, start with 'get' to get all completions for getters
