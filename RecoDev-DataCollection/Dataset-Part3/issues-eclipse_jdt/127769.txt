Eclipse 3.2 Build id: I20060213-0800 (Linux-GTK)

in the section titled:  Changing the encoding used to show the source

it mentions that to set the default encoding for text files, one must follow the path: Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text file encoding

Unfortunately this is an incorrect path; the defalt text encoding is now found under: Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Text file encoding

Fixed in HEAD.
