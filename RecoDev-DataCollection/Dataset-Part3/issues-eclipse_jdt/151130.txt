The plugin.xml in org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user has the following:

<extension point="org.eclipse.help.toc">
   <toc file="topics_GettingStarted.xml" />
   <toc file="topics_TipsTricks.xml" />
   <toc file="topics_Concepts.xml" />
   <toc file="topics_Tasks.xml" />
   <toc file="topics_Reference.xml" />
</extension>

However, the file "topics_TipsTricks.xml" doesn't exist anywhere. It appears help has just been ignoring this; I noticed this while modifying the code. It will also log the problem from now on.

You can simply remove this line since the tips and tricks are already in toc.xml.
