I20050315-1100

OpenAction does not select whole ITypeParameter.

public class Cell {
	public <T> void f(T arg) { }
}

In a source editor, set the caret around a T and press F3
Was: caret is before T
Expected: T is selected

Note that ITypeParameter#getSourceRange() is broken for binary types (bug 88394).

ITypeParameter was not handled in editor's reveal code because it's not an IMember.

Fixed in HEAD.
