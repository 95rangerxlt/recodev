Committing the currently selected code assist on SPACE is unintuitive, and I 
find that it conflicts with what I am trying to do.  Frequently code assist 
does not have what I am trying to type, so I just finish typing it and press 
space to go to the next token.  If what I am typing matches a type, "void" for 
example, code assist enters the current match, such as "Void".  I would like an 
option to turn this off.

There are two changes in the recent build that should take the grief from this 
situation. Filtering does not filter out full matches. E.g., 
Syste<I<Ctrl_Space>>m still shows System as valid completion. Also filtering 
now works on the display presentation of the completion proposal, i.e. a 
whitespace is usually not part of the presentation string.
