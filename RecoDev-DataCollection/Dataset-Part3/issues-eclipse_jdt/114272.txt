Generated source directory will be created at config time, and if config 
changes are made, deleted and re-created.  It should never overlap with an 
existing source directory; contents are deleted in a clean.

The context help for the config UI, as well as the Javadoc for the config API, 
should make this clear.

Present behavior is: Generated source dir is created at config time, or at project build time if it does not already exist.  Generated files have the "derived" bit set.  During a clean, only derived files are removed.
Fixed.  Docs and behavior now match.
