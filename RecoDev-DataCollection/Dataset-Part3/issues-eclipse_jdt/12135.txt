most people use externalize strings actions very infrequently 
it would be a good idea to be able to remove them from the menu
(action set?)

otherwise they just take useful menu space

They are currently object contributions and there is no user control over the 
available object contributions.

The problem with object contributions is that users will have a hard time to 
find them. Therefore we should consider promoting these actions in the Source 
action set. This sould be investigated as part of the menu reorg.
They are no longer object contributions. They are now in the global menu bar or 
in a sub menu of the context menu. So they don't take extra space.
