The pde.junit launch config has some missing functionality compared to the 
jdt.junit launch config:

1) no choice whether all tests inside a container or a single test should be 
run

2) no indication when a launch config corresponds to a single test method.

Both of the above functions are already available when using the pde.junit 
launch short cuts.

Erich,
the "all tests" choice in JUnit allows one to select a library (which is 
neither a project, a package, nor a source folder).
Is this a bug or does the choice extend to libraries as well?
Fixed.
In 3.0 M3, pde.junit uses the main tab of the JDT Junit launcher as is.
