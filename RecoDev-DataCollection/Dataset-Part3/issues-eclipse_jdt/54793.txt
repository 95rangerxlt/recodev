with a Java editor open, if I highlight anything and right click to bring up the
popup menu, the CPU is much more spiky than in M2 particularly the refactor
submenu. I have noticed in general that that M7 seems to have a problem with CPU
utilization. I have had several instances with 100% CPU and had to shut down
Eclipse to get control of the computer. Just moving the cursor around in the
submenus makes the computer stutter and the CPU spikes like mad.

I tried Sun Jdk 1.4.1_02 and 1.4.2 and the JRocket 1.4.2_03 and they all seem to
have the same problem

To make the refactoring context menu context sensitve we now do some 
calculation when the refactoring sub menu opens (not when the editor sub menu 
opens). Besides this can you give some cases when you see the CPU spiking up ? 
This got improved for I20040504. We are now using the AST already computed by 
the editor for semantic coloring, ....
