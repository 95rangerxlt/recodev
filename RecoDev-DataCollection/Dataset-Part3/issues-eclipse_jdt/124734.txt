Currently, the only special token allowed in the annotation processor option values is %ROOT%, which resolves to the workspace directory. Using this token, however, has problems when projects are located outside the workspace directory. Having a %PROJECT.DIR% token would make for a more robust solution.

Changed version to 3.1.1
Fixed in 3.1.1.  Needs to be merged to 3.2.
Merged to 3.2 by tyeung.
Whoops, looks like the merge last week was 3.2 -> 3.1.1, not the other way round.  Still working on getting this into 3.2.
Confirmed merge into 3.2.
