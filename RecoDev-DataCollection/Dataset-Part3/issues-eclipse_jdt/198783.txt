This is because the NodeFinder returns the coveredNode for TypeDeclaration typeNode= (TypeDeclaration) NodeFinder.perform(fBaseCURewrite.getRoot(), type.getSourceRange());
I'm not sure if this is the correct behaviour of NodeFinder, but:
		SimpleName name= (SimpleName) NodeFinder.perform(fBaseCURewrite.getRoot(), type.getNameRange());
		TypeDeclaration typeNode= (TypeDeclaration) ASTNodes.getParent(name, ASTNode.TYPE_DECLARATION);
works
Can you fix it?
