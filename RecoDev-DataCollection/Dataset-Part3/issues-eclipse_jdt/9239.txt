2. search for method declaration - search pattern is: * Test

it finds 11 matches in 1 second, then hangs for 20 seconds (progress bar at 
100%)

CPU usage is high

i guess it's the progress reporting that is a problem:
search for declarations of methods, pattern: * int

it gets to like 99% in half a second and stays there - match count going very 
fast up. and the whole thing looks frozen for like a minute.
Progress reporting is done by J Core.
Improved progress reporting of match locator. The progress is now almost linear.
