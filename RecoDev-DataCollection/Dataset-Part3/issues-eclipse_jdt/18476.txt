The Members view of the Java Browsing Perspective does not follow the cursor
movement when the feature "Synchronize outline selection on cursor move" is
on. The Members view has an outline selection, so that feature must apply to it 
as well.

I cannot see the diferences between the Members view and the Outline view
except the name and the fact that the Outline view shows the Package and
Class names.

In my opinion and for the sake of homogeneity this should to be fixed.

issue understood, cannot fix for 2.0 
Kai, if we want the same behaviour for the outline view does this require some 
actions from the Java editor.
Sorry I meant members view

Major differences:
- the Members view can work without an editor
- the Members view can show the content of any select CU or type

I agree with your request.

Post 2.1

This is not that easy to fix because selection changed event is not sent upon
cursor movements i.e. when the offset changes while the length is 0 (reason is
performance: all selection listeners would be triggered while typing in an editor).

TextViewer now sends a (delayed) selection changed event upon caret position
changes.

Adapted browsing views to this.

FYI: The text infrastructure now sends post selection events. Due bug 39511 the
fix for this bug is currently broken.
