Often the cursor is in the middle of a word but the word is
	not selected. I worked with tools that try to guess/create a selection
	from the current cursor position.

	Example: having i= new Li¦st; where ¦ is the cursor, it would result in [List] if I press F3 or add import

	main concern about this is consistency.

moved to 'active'
Nice idea but I think that requires support from JDT Core since guessing the 
selection is hard when Unicode characters are involved.
fixed you can put the cursor in the middle of a word and the code selection 
sensitive actions interpret this the same as when a word is selected.
