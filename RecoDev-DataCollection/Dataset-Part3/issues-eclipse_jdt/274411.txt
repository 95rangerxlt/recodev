Because of bug 274181, the published jar files were missing entries for directories during this week's milestone builds.  

As a result, teams will need to tag projects that have changed since
I20090429-0930.  Otherwise, the builds will contain the old jars with missing
directory entries.  Features and test bundles do NOT need to be changed. 

Here are the bundles for jdt text


org.eclipse.text
org.eclipse.jface.text
org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor
org.eclipse.ui.editors
org.eclipse.core.filebuffers
org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor

I've re-released all our projects to make a clean sweep.
