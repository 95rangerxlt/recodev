The Package Explorer's "Source" menu is not available when you select one or more working sets, and it would be helpful if it was.  Today, if you want to run "Source > Clean Up..." for every project in a working set, you have to expand the working set and manually select the projects.  Clearly a working set can contain projects for which "Source" menu options don't apply, but they should simply ignore the operation.

I just ran into this yesterday when I tested wanted to use the "Find Broken Externalized Strings"
Benno, can you investigate? Would be nice to have support for working sets for actions that can work on more than one CU.
