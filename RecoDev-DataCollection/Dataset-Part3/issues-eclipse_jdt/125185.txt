I would like to rename the IDiffNode interface to IDiff (since it is not really a node in a graph). However, it is impossible for me to do this without breaking JDT. Therefore, we need to coordinate this. Perhaps we could do it Monday before the integration build to save JDT developers from loading Team from HEAD.
