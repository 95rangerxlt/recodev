Noticed when I tried to delete the method selected in the outline view.  Javadoc 
left in editor.
Shaded area does not include the Javadoc above the method - so only the method 
source was deleted.
Javadoc generated by New Class Wizard looks like:
/*
 * @see IWorkbenchWizard#init(IWorkbench, IStructuredSelection)
 */
public void init(IWorkbench workbench, IStructuredSelection selection) {
}

Needs to be:
/**

method (when I reslect the method in the Outline view.

When overridding a method you often want to leverage that JavaDoc automatically 
down copies the doc from the base method. For this reason you want to create an 
ordinary comment and not a javadoc comment.

This behaviuor is configurable in Prefernces>Java>Code Generation.

We should change the default setting for "create non-Javadoc comments for 
overridden methods " to be off.
