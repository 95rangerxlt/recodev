Build I20021204 + 1204 export

I aborted Eclipse on a big self hosting workspace (no correct saving of the 
state). Restarting the workspace worked fine but when I opened the first 
compilation unit a full build kicked in as a side effect of 
Resource.refreshLocal call from 
CompilationUnitDocumentProvider.createElementInfo. 

No progress monitor is shown in the case. No chance to cancel the full build.
