In the Outline view, there seems to be a new menu item 'Open super 
implementation', and a corresponding decoration on methods to indicate thet 
they have a super implementation.

The UI already knows if the method has a super implementation, so it should 
disable the menu item when there is no super implementation to open to.  
Currently it just does nothing if you select a method with no super 
implementation.
