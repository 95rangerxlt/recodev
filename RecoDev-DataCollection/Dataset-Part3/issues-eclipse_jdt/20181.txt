Could not reproduce on out-of-the-box F2 or F3 builds.
I see it in F2, but when I look at F3 it appears that the page has changed a 
bit.  The mnemonic problem no longer manifests itself.
I changed the page so that the visual feedback for the page element having the 
focus is now much clearer. This should also help screen readers. Alt+B now 
toggle the check box, no need for pressing space.
