Javadoc line wrap breaks words after a minus/hyphen, e.g., well-known into 
well- known. This is inappropriate for HTML, because a browser will not 
eliminate the added space when the line is re-flowed. From that time on, it 
will be displayed as "word- wrap".

In fact, even the same line wrap code does not rejoin the word, so you have 
the situation that inserting a character and backspacing in lines with 
hyphenated words will insert an extra space character.

Actually, the whole word break idea is wrong. Flow should break on whitespace,
period. Anything else garbles the user's document. You have only to see what
happens to O(n**2) around the end of a line to see the problem.
Appears to be fixed.
