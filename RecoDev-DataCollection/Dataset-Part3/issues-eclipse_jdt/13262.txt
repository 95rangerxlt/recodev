Similar to bug #13252 but not quite:

1) open javdoc wizard on project
2) clear the destination field (remove all characters) and open the
   directory dialog.
-> the default location should be something like
      'C:\Documents and Settings\aweinand\My Documents'
3) use this suggestion and close dialog with 'OK'
3) 'finish' the wizard
4) select a class with javadoc within that project
5) from context menu select 'Open external javadoc'
-> a help viewer appears showing the error message:
   'The page cannot be displayed'

Fixed in the latest nightly build. 
You will need to fix the problem with "Error: Access is denied" that happens 
when the javadoc file tries to write to the parent, and it does not catch the 
error.
