Patch to jdt junit to reduce deprecation warnings

The attached patch eliminates most of the warnings due to recent deprecations
in core runtime.
Note: The patch does not remove all dependence one 
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility. The one snag was that one class, 
JUnitLaunchConfiguration, in the org.eclipse.jdt.junit plug-in uses a 
deprecated method on BootLoader:
   BootLoader.inDevelopmentMode()
This reference cannot be removed until bug 60443 is resolved. Once this 
reference is  eliminated, the only other changes required to cut dependence on 
core runtime compatibility are:
(1) change JUnitPlugin.JUnitPlugin(IPluginDescriptor) to 
JUnitPlugin.JUnitPlugin()
(2) change <import plugin="org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility"/>
to <import plugin="org.eclipse.core.runtime"/>


patch released - thanks!

removed the dependency on BootLoader.isDevelopmentMode()
