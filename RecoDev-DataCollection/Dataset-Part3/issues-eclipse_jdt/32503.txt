Do code assist in the following code

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Date().
	}
}

Currently you get no help since Date is not defined.  Why don't we notice this 
and try to do something.  If we would code assist on Date in this failed case 
(and then code assist the next case?) it would do what I want/hope.

You get a quick fix in this case.
In the bug scenario code assist isn't helpful and there is no quick fix due to 
the syntax error, i.e., there is no "red sea" for the incorrect Date type 
reference.

In general I find type reference errors more important than syntax errors. 
Since I'm in the middle of typing I expect syntax errors but I'd like to fix 
type reference errors. 

Notice that the more "common" scenario works fine:
   new Dat<code assist>
this will do the auto import.

Philippe anything we can do with regard to error reporting, so that we can 
still get the type reference error even when there is a syntax error?

moving to JDT Core for comment.
We noticed recently (see bug 31764) that we were not surfacing errors to user, 
and mentionned it to Martin (the UI side was actually doing it wrong too - 
would only show error message if completions were available !?).
I was actually surprised nobody had noticed it, it was already broken in 1.0.

We did not change this since it would require UI action as well, unless we do 
all the smartness (doable). The trickyness is to only surface the relevant 
error to the user. A heuristic would be to find closest error prior to 
completion location. 

I was waiting on someone complaining about this behavior to investigate for 
RC2, since it may have UI implications (hopefully no).

Jdtcore part of the problem is fixed (bug 31764). The error message will be 
shown when bug 32101 will be fixed.

Moving to Jdtui.
