I have already made "Insert space for tabs" checked. But I can still input 
a "tab" into Javadoc, and there's no way to change these tabs to space.
I think it's feasible that making that option valid for editing a Javadoc.

Cannot reproduce on M9. I think we've modified the javadoc auto indenter and all
to not produce any tabs.
