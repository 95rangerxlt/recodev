This shouldn't be the case, as showing the tooltip won't change the state of the
editor. Plus I get the tooltips when I enable Text Hover.

I think content assist and parameter hints should be enabled, too, even if one
can't insert the proposals in the content assist.

I also noticed that sometimes I move from a read-only editor to a writable one
and the 'show tooltip description' menu option is still disabled (seems to
happen if I press F2 in the read-only editor) and I can't get it to enable again
(well it did enable itself after some time, but I don't know what I did to
enable it).

Here's the fix for missing tooltip descriptions in readlonly java editors:
(please correct that ASAP, because it's just a typo resulting in a show-stopping
behaviour)

In org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor::createActions(),
where it says ...
> Action action= new TextOperationAction(JavaEditorMessages.getResourceBundle(),
>     "ShowJavaDoc.", this, ISourceViewer.INFORMATION); //$NON-NLS-1$

... it should read
> Action action= new TextOperationAction(JavaEditorMessages.getResourceBundle(),
>     "ShowJavaDoc.", this, ISourceViewer.INFORMATION, true); //$NON-NLS-1$

The last 'true' enables the Action for readOnlyEditors too, which is what we
definitely want.
