When applying the Cleanup Wizard with the option "Use declaring class as qualifier for static member accesses" and the sub-option "Unqualified accesses" on a class that contains an enum declaration, the produced result contains syntax errors.

Try it with a simple test class:

public class TestClass {
  enum MyEnum {
    STATE_1, STATE_2, STATE_3
  };
}

After applying the wizard with the mentioned options, the code looks as follows:

public class TestClass {
  enum MyEnum {
    MyEnum.STATE_1, MyEnum.STATE_2, MyEnum.STATE_3
  };  
}
