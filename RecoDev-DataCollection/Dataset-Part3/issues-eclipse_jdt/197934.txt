- Import org.eclipse.compare in source
- In 'Hunk', invoke 'extract class'
- quickly try to deselect all check boxes. There's a considerable delay until a checkbox is unchecked. What is computed while this is done?

same delay when changing the class name...
When changing the class name a lookup is performed whether the class is already in use. All CompilationUnits in the same package are checked for types with that name. I guess a delay for performing those checks would be good. The responsivness is fine when you select nested as then only the selected type is checked.
