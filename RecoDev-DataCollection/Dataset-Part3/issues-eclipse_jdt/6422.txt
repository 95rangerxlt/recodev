Build 20011115 (but this was already wrong in 0.9)

If a project has multiple source folders, including one coincidating with the 
output location, then automatic resource copying is occurring for all source 
folders but the coincidating one.

In the end, the coincidating source folder will have all resources from other 
source folders be copied into it, which is introducing confusion.

The resource copy semantics should never copy resources in case any of the 
source folder is coincidating with the output location.
