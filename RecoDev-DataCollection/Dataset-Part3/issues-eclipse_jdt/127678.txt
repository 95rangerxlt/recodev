1. create a new Java project, enter a name and press next
2. on the configure build path page click on 'add source folder'

the 'New Source Folder' wizard has two checkboxes. It seems to me that a radio would be better:
- fix with adding exclusion filter
- or remove them all 
- fix later

A 'detail' link should could show all conflicting folders. A checkbox list could allow the user to apply the change (add excludion or remove) only to a few of them.

If a new source folder can be added without problem, none of the radios should be shown (made invisible)

Showing radios instead of check boxes with a radio 'Ignore nesting conflicts' (only where possible). Showing this radios only if necessary.

Implementing this took me more than a day. The code there is like a card house: touch it and it does collapse. There are 0 tests for this code, since writing tests is not possible. For 3.3 we need to think about a better way to handle class path changes (a real model with operations on it, separated from the UI code. This would allow to write tests, and allows to change the UI without changing the logic, everything else is IMHO suicide).

The 'detail' link is for later.
