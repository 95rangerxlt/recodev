Martin, Erich, and I found several polish items for the Refactorings properties page:

- Tree should also resize vertically when dialog is resized

- Checkbox tree is confusing and not a common Eclipse UI metaphor. Remove checkboxes and change "Remove" button to remove selected items.

- Changes in dialogs should not be applied when the user presses Cancel. If a working copy mode is not feasible, at least remove the "Restore Defaults" and Apply" buttons and change "Remove" to "Remove...".

Oh, while you are at it: Selecting multiple elements and press delete shows an confirmation dialog per entry.

Do you want me to file this in a separate bug?
Yes, that would be better, thanks!
