The last option in the 'compliance and classfiles' tab of the Java compiler
settings is labeled : Inline JSR byte code (bigger class files, but improved
performance). This is not really meaningful (except if you already know what you
speaking about, I guess). It should at least contain the number of the JSR it
refers to.

Philippe, could zou explain this and suggest a better UI name
The JSR bytecode is described in VM spec (Jump SubRoutine). It is mandated by 
Java Spec Request 202.

Now to simplify UI, you should simply say: "Inline finally blocks". JSR 
instructions are used mostly for these.
Oh, ok, it's just a bad name. For me, JSR means Java Specification Request, not
Jump SubRoutine.
May be you can put the whole name instead of the abbreviation.
changed to "Inline finally blocks" as suggested
