3.2 RC5

No problem IMO. This is a list of contributors and their contributions, and both parties are initial contributors. I don't think we should merge the two entries into one.
How can two provide the initial code? I'm not a lawyer. If Martin says it's OK then that's fine with me.
I guess if two persons work at it together on an initial implementation then that needs to be reflected as well.

No change for 3.2
