If I turn on line number in the Java editor, then whenever the mouse pointer
passes over one of the line number, some section of the file I'm editing becomes
selected, and the selection starts moving with the mouse pointer.  To clear the
selection I have to click in the file.  Everything is back to normal until my
mouse passes over a line number again which start it all over again.  This is
very annoying if one has browsing/debugging windows to the left of a java file
since just moving back to the editing window (and thus over a line number) will
cause this highlight behavor.

The workaround is to turn off line numbers for now.

It should only select when clicking on the line number ruler. Can you confirm
that you don't click on the line number ruler?

Cannot reproduce on WinXP. Tom, please verify on Linux.

Cannot reproduce with 3.0 M4 on Linux/GTK. Brian, what windowing system are you
using?
I did some more investigations.

First I'm using RH9 so I'm using Gnome

When you fist open the file the highlighting works as it should: only when I
left click does the highlighting occur.

If I right click on a line and then clear the pop-up menu, then the unwanted
highlighting occurs.  From that time onwards, whenever I pass over a line number
the editor will highlight from the number I pass over to the location of my last
right click.

Good job!

Can now reproduce on both motif and GTK using the steps described in comment 3.
I suspect that we get different mouse down / up events on linux than on the
other platforms. Investigating.
Indeed, we don't get a MouseUp notification on Linux when a menu is opened.
Changed the code such that the ruler selection happens only when the left mouse
button is pressed (which is better anyway, as the right mouse button is not used
to select). 

Will release the fix after the I-Build.
