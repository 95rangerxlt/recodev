Build 20020122

If you open a hierarchy on a type, and one of the super types has never been 
opened before, then a HierarchyType is used to compute it. However the 
hierarchy resolver doesn't handle HierarchyTypes when it tries to find the 
corresponding handle. As a result, the hierarchy is missing some super types.

hierarchy resolver doesn't handle HierarchyTypes when it tries to find the 
corresponding handle. As a result, the hierarchy is missing some super types.
Fixed by handling HierarchyTypes in HierarchyResolver.findSuperClass(...) and 
findSuperInterfaces(...), and by adding the super type name and super interface 
names to the HierarchyType.
