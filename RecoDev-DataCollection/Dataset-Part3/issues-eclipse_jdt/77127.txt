I would prefer to have a different icon for them if we can come up with one. For
me enum constants aren't static final fields. This is more an implementation
detail. 
Discussed with the design team and we couldn't come up with a nice icon. So I
opt to render it as public without the static indication. Have to check why code
assists renders them as static. They are using the same label provider.
Perhaps we could somehow put more emphasis on the fact that enum constants are 
constant, e.g. by rendering them as public final fields
They are now rendered as public static final fields.
