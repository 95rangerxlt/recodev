These extensions are listed in the table of contents under "Extension Points 
Reference" but if you click on the reference page itself, they are not listed 
on that page:

org.eclipse.jdt.junit.testRunListeners
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javadocCompletionProcessor

Also the extension names on the reference page are not sorted which makes them 
harder to find.

Fixed and released in HEAD.
