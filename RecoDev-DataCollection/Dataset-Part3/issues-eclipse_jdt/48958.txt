Edit New Lines pref using new code formatter prefs. Nothing happens in the
preview when changing the The following preference:

[ ] Preserve existing new line breaks

In addition, it is not clear whether this only affects empty lines or whether
this means it preserves the line delimiter style (e.g. keeps CR in my file even
though I format on Windows where line break is CRLF).

Can you please comment.
Olivier, can you explain what this option does? Thanks.
The constant I know is FORMATTER_PRESERVE_USER_LINEBREAKS.
This preserves existing line breaks in the code. It converts them to the line 
delimiter specified to the code formatter. In general it makes the formatted 
string very ugly, because it is mixing formatting and preservation of existing 
line breaks.
