I would like to be able to filter closed projects from the packages view.
There are several issues here:

- open/closed is now done on projects without an additional dialog (this is
  consistent with the navigator). So if we filter out closed projects you
  have no UI to open them again.

- there is a filter for filtering out Non Java Projects. But this has the
  side effect that a closed Java Porject gets filtered out too, since closed
  projects don't have a nature anymore.

Best from the UI side would be to provide filters regarding to a nature of a 
project. But since closed projects don't have a nature anymore this is not 
possible.

Asking Core if there is a way to query the nature for closed projects. I know 
that a project doesn't have any state anymore, but the nature could be 
interpreted like the name of a project.
You can't get the nature information from a closed project. This information is
stored in the project description which isn't available unless the project is open.
If we do add a filter for closed projects this should be in sync with the 
navigator. Additionally we need a different Open Project action in this case.

Asking Nick if something is planned for Platform UI. If not we should postpone 
> 2.1
No plans to change filtering of closed projects in the Navigator for 2.1.

*** Bug 30677 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Note that in build i0206 (1700) if you select to filter out Non-Shared 
projects, then the closed projects disappear from the Packages View. (even 
though my closed projects are shared)

Not sure if this is a bug or not, but I'll take advantage of this "feature" to 
get the behaviour I want until this enhancement is implemented. :-)
Reopening...
Got addressed for 2.1
