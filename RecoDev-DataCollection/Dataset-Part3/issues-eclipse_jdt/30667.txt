It should be possible to quickly create a new package as a subpackage of an
already existing package. 

A suggestion: upon activating the new>package menu from a selected package, the
name field in the dialog box could already contain the name of the selected
package (possibly with the name completely selected). Just appending a ".foo"
would suffice to create a subpackage thereof.
