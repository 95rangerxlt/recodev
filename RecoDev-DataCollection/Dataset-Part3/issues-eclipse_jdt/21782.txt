The Create a Java Class Wizard should provide code assist to make it easier to 
select a supertype/enclosing type. It would be cool if you could start typing 
the name in the field, and then just hit Ctrl+Space to complete it. This would 
be much more convenient than going to the (somewhat slow) class selection 
dialog.
