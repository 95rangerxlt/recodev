Test cases for AST rewrite for type annotations

One bug found.
I have added a test case:
testEmptyListInsertAnnotation().

Review is needed for this patch.
Bug filed for the failing test case:
Bug 404668 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=404668)
1.Move the tests to a new class/file, ASTRewritingTypeAnnotations.java


2.testTypeArgumentsParameterizedClassesAnnotations() : 2nd test -
//Replace an use of an annotation
rewrite.replace((ASTNode) simpleType.annotations().get(0),markerAnnotation, null);
//Empty annotations list
rewrite.remove((ASTNode) simpleType.annotations().get(0), null);
 => no effect for the first statement - change the test

3. testRewriteInsertAPIAnnotation(): first block - remove the comments

4. testRewriteInsertAPIAnnotation(): first block - first statement - no effect.

5. testEmptyListInsertAnnotations() fails - since a bug is already filed, comment this test out using _test*.

The new ASTRewritingTypeAnnotationsTest does not appear to be hooked up
anywhere - How will these tests run ?

New patch to ensure the test cases are part of test suite ASTRewritingTest.java

New patch which contains changes necessary for the tests to run. They have been added as part of ASTRewritingTest.java
This test only patch was reviewed by Manoj. Thanks Shankha & Manoj.
Does the series of buf.append calls make any sense ? Why won't it be a single
call ? I am not asking for the patch to be modified, but in future, we need to
ask such questions when copy pasting code.
