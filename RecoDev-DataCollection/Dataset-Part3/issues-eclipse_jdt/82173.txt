Angular Bracket auto closing does not work for a field type. In this example:

    void m() {
        HashMap hm= new HashMap();
        ...

... an opening bracket < is
- automatically closed when inserted between HashMap and ()
- not automatically closed when inserted between HashMap and hm.

It should be closed in both cases.

It should be closed in both cases.
Another case:
    public <
should auto-close, since I want to define a parameterized method like
    public <T> T getT() {..}

And also without modifier:
    class C {
        <
or
    class C {
        void m() {}
        <
or
    class C {
        Field f;
        <

The heuristic for this could be that angle brackets are auto-closed if the
previous word was a keyword or { or } or ;
