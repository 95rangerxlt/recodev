RC1:
- create class C
- create method "int C()"
     int C() {
          return 19*19;
     }
- use QF to "Change method to constructor"
Observe: return statement is removed
- add "if (true) return 123;" as the first line of method C()
- use QF again
Observe: no return statement is removed.

IMO the quick fix shouldn't try to fix the body. If it has a return statement 
leave it as it is.
