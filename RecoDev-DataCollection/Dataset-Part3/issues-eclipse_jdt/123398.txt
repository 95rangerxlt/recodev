Enable 'Insert common prefixes automatically' and then invoke Content Assist:

public class MyType {
	void m() {
		"foobar".subs/*Content Assist here*/
	}
}

'substring' gets completed and the two substring(..) proposals are correctly shown. The third proposal 'subSequence(..)' should either not be shown any more, or it should replace the 'substring' with 'subSequence' in the editor.

The call to getSelectedProposal in setProposals causes a reentrant setProposals call from the filter runnable.
