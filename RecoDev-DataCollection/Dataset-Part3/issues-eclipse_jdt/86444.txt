screenshot showing persistent hover. Note the right half appears cropped.

Notes:
- browser widget works fine in Javadoc view
- perhaps a layouting problem?
DefaultInformationControl also shows correctly.
Tom, is this still a problem?
Works as expected with I20060314-1200-motif. Reopening to close as fixed.
Fixed.
