I began discovering non-externalized string warnings in my code because the
comment formatter is wrapping the special //$NON-NLS-1$ comments when they
exceed the line length limit. Is there any way we can avoid wrapping these comments?

Tobias, please check. I don't think it's a regression. As far as I know this is
also a problem of the standarf formatter (i.e. if comment formatting is off).
