It would be good to have a decoration in the Outline view etc.. showing if a method is native. If there is no remaining real-estate for this, then maybe applying a filter to the entire icon so it appears in grayscale would be the way to go.

N can go to top-right (mutually exclusive with constructor and abstract).

Fix

'native' needs to be on the top row, since the bottom row is already used for synchronized and overrides/implements method adornments on the right, and problem indicators on the left. On top, a method can already be static and final, which are both more important than native (since these affect callers as well).

I've added the 'N' to the top row, as leftmost item. That way, the 'N' can be cut off when the icon is narrow and we only have 2 slots (Package Explorer, Breadcrumb), but it is visible in the Outline, Search, and Type Hierarchy views.
Fixed in HEAD.

Why was it closed? the other one is already closed. It means that the problem still exists and it has not been solved.
