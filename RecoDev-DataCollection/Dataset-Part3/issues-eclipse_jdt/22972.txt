I have code

------------------
package com.MyCompany.med.loki.rftag;

public class MyClass {
    RFTag tagLabel;
    FilmInfo filmInfo;
    TagCounter counter;
    FilmInfoCodec codec;
}
-------------

with several members from another package 
So Eclipse informs about the errors (RFTAG cannot be resolved ...) and if i press 
Ctrl+1 (quickfix) on the errors i get the opportunity to import the correct
class. So far so good. 
So I put my cursor on RFTag, I press "Ctrl+1" then I press "Enter" (because the
first suggestions is the good one) and then i press "down arrow" to proceed to
the following error. If you do this sequence slowly than everything works out
fine and the 4 import statements are added..
BUT ....
Do the sequence ("Ctrl+1", "Enter", "Down Arrow") a bit too fast and you end up
with the following import statements...

*----------
import com.MyCompany.med.hermod.rftag.FilmIn
i
import com.MyCompany.med.hermod.rftag.FilmInfoCodec;
*----------

The editor is not fast enough to copy with all the quickfixes..

I can reproduce something similar.  With the following class:

public class A 	 {
	HashMap map;
	InputStream stream;
	IFile file;
}

If I do the quick fixes very fast I get:

import java.io.InputStrea

import org.eclipse.core.resources.IFile;

It looks like the text insertions are getting cut off, or inserted on top of
each other.
Re-tested using R3.4 M6. I was unable to re-create the problem using John's example from comment #1. It's possible that my machine is just too fast now see it, but given the amount of changes that have happened in that support over the last 5 years, I'm going to assume it has been fixed.

Please re-open if this is still an issue.
