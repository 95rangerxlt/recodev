1) open a empty workspace
		2) connect to cvslnx - /home/cvs/desktop
		3) load org.eclipse.ui.

		A few errors will be showed in the tasklist because ECLIPSE_HOME was not defined.

		4) Create a new Java Project (J1)

		The compiler will start compiling org.eclipse.ui. again.

		i) I am just creating a project which will not fix any compilation problem so it should not compile anything.
		ii) The cancel button is not enabled.
		ii) Could you pre-define a classpath var pointing to the plafform directory ,the same way
		you pre-define JRE_LIB etc. ECLIPSE_TARGET, ECLIPSE_WORKSPACE, ECLIPSE_HOME
		whatever the name you choose.
