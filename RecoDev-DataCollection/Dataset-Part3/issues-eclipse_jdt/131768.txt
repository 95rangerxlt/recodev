I need some API additions for the new "Replace Invocations" refactoring:

org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions:
+ constant IJavaEditorActionDefinitionIds.REPLACE_INVOCATIONS
+ constant JdtActionConstants.REPLACE_INVOCATIONS
+ ReplaceInvocationsAction.java

org.eclipse.jdt.ui/plugin.xml:
+ action and command definitions

Erich, could you please give PMC approval?

API is in, implementation is still under construction
