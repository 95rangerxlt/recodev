While using JUnit 4.0, we have come up with considerations for improving JUnit test generation. We think that the user should be able to choose 3.8 or 4.0 style of JUnit test. If the user selects 3.8, then the format should stay the same. If the user chooses 4.0, the format should reflect the following style.

public MyTestClass {

	public static junit.framework.Test suite(){
		return new JUnit4TestAdapter(MyTestClass.class);
	}
}

The Junit test case wizard should be updated to offer creating JUnit 4 test cases.
Is JUnit 4.0 supported in Eclipse?  I thought it was just released.
Martin has added proper JUnit4 support to the wizard.
