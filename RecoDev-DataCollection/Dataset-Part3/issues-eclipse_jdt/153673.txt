I am attaching a simple project for that.
If I have a test class which subclasses some Test subclass (typically a decorator which could be in a jar or another source tree), and I select a source tree to run as Junit test that does not contan the superclass (w in that caseich typically has no tests to run anyway), that superclass will still be collected and part of the test run, always resulting in an annoying warning. 
In the attached project, in the pacakge explorer select the tst source tree, right clck and run as /Junit tests.
See the junit view to understand the problem.
The Decorator should never be run IMHO in that case.
The problem is the same (and more annoying) if you subclass some test calss that is in a jar.

Sample project
For me, there is no warning or something in the current nightly build. Seems to be fixed.

Version: 3.3.0
Build id: N20060812-0010
confirmed... this is no longer present in 33m1 and higher for sure.
