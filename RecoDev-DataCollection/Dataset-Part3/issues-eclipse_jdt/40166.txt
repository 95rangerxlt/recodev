It would be very nice to have an option to highlight method names in the Java
Editor like this:
public String *getAttribute*(String name){
    /* code here */
    return attr;
}

Having the getAttribute declaration highlighted(bolded, alt color) greatly
improves readability as it is easier to pick out individual methods in a singe
source file. A sample of this functionality is the Python IDLE, where every
method declaration is highlighted.

This has been fixed in the 3.0 stream.
