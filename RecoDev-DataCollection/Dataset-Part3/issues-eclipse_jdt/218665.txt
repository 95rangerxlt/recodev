Build ID: I20080207-1530

Steps To Reproduce:
By default, Eclipse is configured to use double-click to open items. This makes the breadcrumb bar navigation (via popup selector lists) too slow as compared to the native breadcrumb bar in Windows Vista Explorer. The General -> Open Mode can be set to single click, but that will affect all the views and not only the breadcrumb bar.

Double-click is too much here. Let's try always single-click like in our Quick views.

I'm not sure if I like the single click. But I like it that it is now possible to open every drop down with double-click.

I'm a little confused over the last comment. Does it take double-click to open the drop-down instead of single-click? Does it still take double-click to select an item in the popup list, or is it a single-click?

Thanks

In the breadcrumb: Double-click to open the drop-down (the only change is that this is now possible for all elements)
In the drop downs: Single-click to open an element

Apologies for being obtuse here. The breadcrumb bar segment is what i define to be the icon, label and the arrow icon that shows the popup list. Single click on the label selects the segment, and single click on the arrow shows the popup list. So, are you talking about showing the popup list on double-clicking the label (in addition to the existing functionality of single-clicking the arrow icon)?

Yep, but it's not totally new: it already worked like that (double-click on label opening the pop up list) for non-openable breadcrumb elements like a package.
I see. Thanks for the clarifications and a very useful addition to the Java editor. I've mentioned on my blog [1] that i'm trying this exclusively for the next few weeks (no package explorer and no outline view). The only time i need to go to the package explorer view is to refresh a project (218666 that was marked as WONTFIX along with fix to 218668 would address this scenario).
