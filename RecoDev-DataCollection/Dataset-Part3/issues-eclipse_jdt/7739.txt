When the Java editor's "insert newline before opening brace" option is chosen, 
and then the java code is formatted the indentation does not match industry-
standard style. The most common
"newline before" style is:

if (condition)
{
  statement;
}

Another "newline before" style is:

if (condition)
   {
   statement;
   }

but what you get is:

if (condition)
   {
    statement;
}

This mixture of the two above is something I've never seen before.  I thought 
the intent of newline before opening brace was to line up the two braces?
