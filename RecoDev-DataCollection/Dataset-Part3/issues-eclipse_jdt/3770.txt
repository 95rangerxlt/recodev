	the Java preference page needs space between the different groups.
	Package view related prefs should come together.
	There should be whitespace before the hierarchy preference setting.

	adding white space is work since we are using the preference dialog	
	fields. This is not critcal, but the order of the packages view prefs
	should change.

We need a custom layout that doesn't use fields. Otherwise we don't have enough 
control.
The sole reason for dropping the field editors is a missing space?
Maybe we should have the field editors give us the missing control.
OK, let's not throw them out yet. But then we should do a Spacer Field Editor 
that allows us to insert space. This should be trival. Can you please look into 
this?

I will bring up the field editor issue with the desktop team again.
One goal of having the field editors is to relieve the writer of the preference 
page from having to layout the fields himself and guaranteee a consistent 
layout throughout the preference pages. A 'spacer' would defeat this purpose. 
I'd rather suggest that spacing between groups of field editors should be 
handled transparently by the layout algorithm. I'll look into it to figure out 
if and how this could be done.
The main purpose of FieldEditors is not layout but handling the field logic 
(saving and loading from preferences). Clients should have control over the 
layout of the controls inside a field editor. This was the initial 
implementation, and I want to check with the desktop why this got changed.

Therefore a spacer is OK.
