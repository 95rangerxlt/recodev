I (accidentally) typed in:

throw RuntimeException("message");

in my code (which of course didn't compile). The quick-fix suggestion was to create a method called 
'RuntimeException', but it should hopefully have also detected that RuntimeException is the name of a 
known Exception, and suggested instead 'throw new RuntimeException("message")' which is of course 
the one that I wanted.

Obviously a minor enhancement, but a feature request all the same.
