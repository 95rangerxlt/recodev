Once the code formatter is fixed, the code formatter preference page should surface it.
I'll try to provide a patch to get accustomed with this code.

Proposed fix
I updated the Ui to contain the new option and updated the preview example.
However, it seems that the code formatter isn't doing anything here, can you have a look?
It's in I20061121.
