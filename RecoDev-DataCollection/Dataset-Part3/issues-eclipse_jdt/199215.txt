The default names for the new class and the parameter are currently <classname>Parameter and parameterObject.
"Parameter" is not an appropriate term in this context. A better choice would be
<classname>Data and data (or fData, depending on code style for fields).

Good catch! I guess it's trivial to change, karsten?

This patch contains some source refactoring to make it easier to read and maintain. It is very well tested and runs on any applicable class in compare plugin just fine.

Test Patches

These are the updates for the patches. I did not chose to set the fields name to parameterObject in the tests in order to test the correct creation of the name.
Thus nearly all tests had to be updated.
Oh, due to bug 199558 I was not able to put the removal of InnerClassParameter.java into the test. It is no longer necessary and can be removed.
