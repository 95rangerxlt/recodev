In the Java Editor when I hover over a variable a popup comes up that shows me the JavaDoc and I can press F2 to focus that popup and mark something inside that popup. Add this functionality to the QuickDiff. It would be very convenient, if I can focus the QuickDiff popup and revert the changes easily by copy and paste from the QuickDiff popup.

This is now possible if the editor has focus (however, you don't get the F2 hint for now). Note that the quick diff hover will still contain the ">" and "+" marks, so direct copying and pasting will not work.

Note however, that you can easily revert changes by either using the ruler context menu "Rever {Line, Block, Selection}", or by add key bindings to the relevant commands. For example, I usually bind Alt+Ctrl+Arrow_Left to the "Text Editing > Revert Lines" command, which will revert the selection (if it exists) or the current contiguous block of modified lines.

Is it possible to implement this feature in all editors? For example it does not work with text editor although the text editor has QuickDiff support.

This bug - as reported in comment 0 - was fixed in RC2. Please don't reopen fixed bugs.

Note that F2 support is not present for any hover in the text editor. I filed bug 149519 to cover this.
