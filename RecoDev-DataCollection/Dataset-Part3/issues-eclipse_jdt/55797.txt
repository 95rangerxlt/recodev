In the 0323 (1600) build.

Load the platform-ui and jdt-ui modules
Switch to the Java perspective
Open the file AbstractTextEditor
Show it in the hierarchy view
From the hierarchy view select all of the fields, popup the menu, select "copy"
Go to the dispose method, put the insertion point just before the call to
     super.dispose() 
Paste the field names in.

There should be many lines of the form:

   fSelectionChangedListener : ISelectionChangedListener

Starting with the first line select from the ":" to the end and replace it 
with " = null;"

Put the " = null;" into the clipboard

For each of the remaining items select from the ":" to the end
Popup the menu and select paste.

Keep doing this a few times and you should notice that you can paste more text 
than can be processed by the editor. 


I did notice that the error indicators are being redrawn multiple times for 
each paste (looks like about 3 times)


If instead of pasting the "= null" you type each individual character you can 
also see multiple redraws as well.
