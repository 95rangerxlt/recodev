I just installed Eclipse 3.2 and have been using it for a couple of days.  It seems that the "Copy failure list" menu item now will ignore errors.  It won't show up when you have only errors but no failures.  Our project happens to have a Ruby script that parses the error/failure list and populates a test suite from it.  It's quite annoying that we can not do it anymore.
