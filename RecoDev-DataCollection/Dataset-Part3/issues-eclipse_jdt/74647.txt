Can you give an example? I tried in I200409212000 with the following example,
and nothing was truncated:

	public void testLongMsg() {
		fail(
				"This is a very long message text, " +
				"and I want to see the whole text " +
				"in the JUnit view." +
				"\nI even added an extra line here." +
				"\n" +
				"\n" +
				"\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Some more text.");
	}

Closing as WORKSFORME. Reopen if you have steps to reproduce.

JUnit trace obtained from "copy trace" -- no trunctaion
I believe you test did not use a long enough message. Attached is a screenshot
for the junit failure trace (the selected line was truncated). Also attached is
the trace contexts obtained via "copy trace" and pasted into an editor. 

This is for 3.1-M5a. 
Looks like a platform limitation: a table item only shows the first 255 characters.

	public void testFail() throws Exception {
		StringBuffer buf= new StringBuffer();
		DecimalFormat format= new DecimalFormat("00");
		for (int i= 0; i < 20; i++) {
			buf.append("Group of twenty:");
			buf.append(format.format(i));
			buf.append(". ");
		}
		fail(buf.toString());
	}

Fixed. The message is now shown in chunks of 256 characters per line.
