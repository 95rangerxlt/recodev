closed projects are non-java projects 
but it does not work the other way

so there's no (filter-based) way to remove only closed projects

The problem is that if the filter is enabled you have to go to the navigator to 
open closed projects again or to disable the filter. We are now using 
platform's open/close actions and they don't show a dialog with closed 
projects. However we could reactivate your own dialog.

isn't that tru for any other filter too?
Added a filter.
Open/close actions will be adapted by Dirk.

Note: We had to provide the filter for RC1 even though it is an enhancement and
it was set to P3 because we users got confused when the non-Java projects filter
removed the Java projects (see also bug 31127).
