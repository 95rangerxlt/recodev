The template "NEWTYPE" for JDT code generation doesn't exist in the German 
locale. It does exist in English, Spanish, and Italian. Other I have not 
tested. 

This template is for New Java Types and determines the placement of the type 
comment, package declarations, and type declaration.

Martin, an you please investiagte. I guess that the template is already 
missing in the 2.1 and 2.1.1. 
The bug is in the nls package:
file TemplateMessages_de.properties

CodeTemplates.newfile.content1=Erstellt am ${Datum}

should be

CodeTemplates.newfile.content1=Erstellt am ${Date}

(Do not translate template names!)
moving to jdt.ui inbox

the properties file now contains comments with instructions to not translate 
the variable names.
I informed Tim Koss about that issue. Must be fixed in translation bundle 
provided by IBM.
