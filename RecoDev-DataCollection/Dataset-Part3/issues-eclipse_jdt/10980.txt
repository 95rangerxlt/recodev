There're two ways to create a new type with a DOMFactory: createType() and 
createType(String).  The first always creates a new class, the latter can 
create either interfaces or classes from an existing source.

It would be nice, if you'd add an additional 

 public IType createInterface() {
   return createType("public interface AnInterface ...");
 }

factory method.  Renaming createType() to createClass() could also be an 
improvement.

Fixed and released in HEAD.
