Under the Java/Compiler preferences setting, Unused Code tab, when the 'Unused
private types, methods or fields' level is set to Warning, it seems to warn when
the value is not read, not when it is unused.  For example, I have an entity
bean with a method variable ctx that is assigned a value in the setEntityContext
method.  It is used in the assignment but not used elsewhere.  The warning in
the editor is 'The private field ctx is never read locally'.

It seems that the setting of unused and the warning description of unread is not
consistent.  I wish to be warning of method variables that are never used, but
not assign but never read.

Initially we had implemented our unused variable warnings to exactly be unused, 
and after user request, we changed it to instead report unread variable 
accesses.

I agree though that the description should be consistent and not be surprising.
Passing onto UI for addressing the preference description
Silvio, can you look into this and provide a patch.
Created attachment 6567
Patch for the preference/property page messages

Given the limited space for the description, this should be general enough to
include all cases.
