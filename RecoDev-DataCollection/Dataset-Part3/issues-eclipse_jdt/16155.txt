Select a type.
In the Refactor menu (and in the context menu's Refactor submenu) there are 2 
menu items:
- Rename Element...
- Move Element...

These should just be:
- Rename...
- Move...

The reason is that it is inconsistent with the rest of the UI.
i.e. What's an "element"? The "selected item?
The word "element" is redundant. Not only is it unnecessary, it also creates 
confusion.

very curious how this discussion develops :)
Not having Element in there would cause even more confusion.
There is already File>Rename and we did not want to have two actions with the 
same name in the menu. We also did not want to have the refactoring rename in 
the file menu.

Changing the menu label to Rename Class, Rename Method dynamically is not 
doable because of performance reasons.

OK to close?
I don't see that there is confusion with a menu item that has the same name as 
one in an unrelated pulldown compared to one that is in the submenu of a 
popup.  I also don't care that much.
Select a non-java file in the packages view.
- File->Rename...
and
- context menu->Refactor->Rename Element...
are currently the same action. Same with Move.../Move Element...
Try it.

So you are already have a direct conflict in your menu item names.  :)

I really think they should all just be "Rename..." and "Move...".
The context is provided by the selected item.
What's wrong with that?
It just fees really wrong to me to have "Element" in there.
There is no value added.
And the first time I saw it, I had to pause and say "What on earth is an 
element?"
didn't work well - removed
