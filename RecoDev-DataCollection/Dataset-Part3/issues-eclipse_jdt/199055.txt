Dragging multiple items in the Outline view can result in unexpected copy operations:

public class A {
	int a;
	int b;
	int c;
	int d;
}

Select "b" and "c", and drag to before or after "b" or "c"
=> you get the "insertion line" feedback and the cursor gets a "+"
=> expected: should be a no-op and cursor should be either "normal" drop or disabled

Drop there
=> elements are duplicated
