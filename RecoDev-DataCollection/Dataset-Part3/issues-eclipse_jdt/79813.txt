MultiTypeSelectionDialog can contain duplicate types that are indistinguishable
if there are types of the same name and package on the classpath (for example, I
am refactoring java.io, so I have two copies of each in differnet locations).  

TypeSelectionDialog handles this by having a second pane where you can choose
the package for any type.  I would expect MultiTypeSelectionDialog to have at
least some mechanism for distinguishing between types of the same name (maybe a
tooltip displaying location?).

This got fixed with the new open type dialog.
