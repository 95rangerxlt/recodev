build 0508

With the new cool support for Team operations and decorations on Types, the 
decorators don't appear to be updating.  For example,

In the Java Browsing perspective,
1- add a new class
2- Team->Add to Version Control

You should see a little red checkmark appear beside the class icon in the types 
view.

If you select a different package then select back to the first, the checkmark 
is there.
