Add constants for new participant-aware refactorings to IRefactoringProcessorIds and let implementations of RefactoringProcessor#getIdentifier() point to the API constants:
- ChangeSignatureProcessor
- IntroduceParameterObjectProcessor
Should create a new interface for the additional constants in o.e.jdt.core.manipulation (don't add to interface in jdt.ui).

These processorIds are interesting for contributors to refactoring participant extension points (e.g. org.eclipse.jdt.core.manipulation.changeMethodSignatureParticipants). The id can be used in a <with variable="..."> expression, e.g. to distinguish between changeMethodSignatureRefactoring and introduceParameterObjectRefactoring.
