When I import some of my classes, they are imported as follows :

import com
    .foo
    .bar
    .webservice
    .FormResourceFormatter;

I would expect them to be on the same line. The funny thing is that only a few
classes behave this way, the rest seem to be imported correctly in one line as
expected.

Thanks,

we have seen that before.
Martin, is it fixed now?
I removed the formatting feature again. As long as the formatter has this weird 
way of keeping the lines below the max. line length it is not helpful.

The workaround for older builds is to set Preferences->java->Code Formater-
>Line Splitting->Max. Line Lengths to a larger value
