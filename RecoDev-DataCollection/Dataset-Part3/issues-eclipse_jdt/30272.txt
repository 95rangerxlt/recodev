create 2 simple projects in package explorer
and delete them (doesn't metter if you delete content or not)

explorer still shows them - as closed
they do not exist (not in the navigator and pressing F5 results in an exception)

all is fine, however, if you delete just 1 simple project
jdt ui action forwards to the platform action for project deletetion, so it 
cannot be the reorg code

i suspect incorrect handling of deltas (navigator works fine)

This was a bug in Java Core that is fixed in HEAD.
Verified that it behaves properly with the fix.
