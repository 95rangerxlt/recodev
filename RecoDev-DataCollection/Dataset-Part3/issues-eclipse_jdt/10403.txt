When a user creates a new project for an existing directory structure, we 
should confirm that the output directory can be deleted then rebuilt.

Some users are creating projects & pointing the output folder at a bin 
directory which contains more than just .class files which can be rebuilt from 
the available .java files.

I think this should be in JavaConventions.validateClasspath
No, jdt.core cannot ask any user confirmation.
agreed, that core cannot do the UI, it could return a status that the bin 
folder isn't empty. However, it might be easer for to do this check in the UI 
since the wizard knows when the bin folder has changed.
ok, sorry, I read the PR too fast. I thought the PR was about preventing the 
user from setting the bin folder to a dir that contains read-only files. (Say 
the outputfolder can't be deleted)


fixed > 20020328
A warning is now shown if the outputfolder is changed to a non-empty folder.
