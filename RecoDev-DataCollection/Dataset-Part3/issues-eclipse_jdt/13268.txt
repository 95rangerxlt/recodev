The code formatter specifies if tabs or spaces are used for indention.
TextUtil.createIndentString is used at several places to indent, but only adds 
tabs.

The clean solution is to always use the code formatter to indent.

- ExtractMethod
- Try/catch
- Add local variable (corrections)
- extract temp
- templates

But using the formatter is sometime hard if you want to preserve existing 
formatting
correct, but some users do not want to have any tabs in their source. we should 
support this.
*** Bug 12293 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Fixed extract method and surround with try/catch.

Adam please make sure that extract temp honors the settings as well. 

If so, please move PR to Claude. He must ensure that templates do the right
thing.
what a weird preference - i just used for the first time.
why would somebody what this? :) you press tab, you get n spaces and then it 
takes n arrow-left hits to come back.

oh well, it takes all sorts, i guess. :)
anyway, fixed - bounce to Claude.
fixed already by DB
