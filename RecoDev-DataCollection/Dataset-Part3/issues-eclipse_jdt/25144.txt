- in self hosting workspace,
- ensure SWT has source
- create a new subclass of org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Layout called TestLayout
- notice that the two methods (computeSize and layout) have argument names from 
the declaration, like:
	protected void layout(Composite composite, boolean flushCache)
- delete method layout
- a yellow light appears on the class decl for TestLayout
- click on it and choose Add unimplemented methods
- it shows up as:
	protected void layout(Composite arg0, boolean arg1)
