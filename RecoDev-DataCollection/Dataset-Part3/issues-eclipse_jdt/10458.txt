Please enable Hierarchy view to support DND as a way to "focus on" something,

Also, support F4 in the new Java Browsing Views.
I think Kent was interested in this behavior also.  If we could have the 
Hierarchy View be additive when I perform DND, that would be great.

When the hierarchy gets "full", I would like to either add another page to it 
(Since I can't open the same View twice), or clone the entire Perspective into 
another top-level workbench window, so I can work with two different 
hierarchies.  I think for most developers, the ideal navigation is focused 
around packages and hierarchies.  The Types list is nice, but gets too long.
The team has started to use drag&drop for setting the View input and it works 
well (see CVS Resource History). We should do the same with the type hierarchy 
view.

Droping a type or CU in the top pane should be the analog of a "focus". If the 
CU contains more than one type we should prompt as usual.

current solution not too usable. still need a unified d&d story for all jdt-ui 
views.
