(Originally Bug 70289)
In the case where the common prefix is actually a fully qualified valid class or
method the current UI is misleading because it looks exactly like when there is
only a single match for that name.  Possibly the completion dialog should appear
in that case to clear up the confusion, or if that is deemed to much of a
slowdown, there should be some other "faster" visual designation that the
completion is only partial.

We now always show the popup if there are choices left, even if the last
prefix-completion pass *did* insert characters. This is not bash-like, but ok
since the popup does not bother much.
