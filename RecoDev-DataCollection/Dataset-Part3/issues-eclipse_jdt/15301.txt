if the Java file is not on the build path then it is a non-Java resource and 
show in packages can reveal the non-Java resource. JDT Core provides a method 
to check whether a file is on the build class path.

Dirk moving to you since you have started to improve show in packages already
Assume that the problem is getParent in the JavaContentProvider. It might 
return null in this case which makes it impossible to reveal it in the packages 
view.
