From the user's perspective, there is an unexpected behavioral difference when 
manipulation source in the type hierarchy and in the method list of the browser 
perspective.

1) open Java Browsing Perspective
2) select a type
3) select a method in the method list view
4) delete the method (context menu of the method list view)
-> editor becomes dirty (ok)

5) select another type
6) open type hierarchy on this type, dock the hierachy view
7) select a method in the method list view
8) select the same method in the hierarchy view
9) delete the method (context menu of the hierarchy view)
-> method is deleted on file system, type list view, method list view, editor 
are all cleared

Note: This is not the case when the editor is dirty. Then both manipulations 
behave the same.

Expected behavior: If there is an open editor, all manipulations should just 
work on the working copy shown in the editor.

I can only reproduce this if editor for type X is NOT open. And this can only be
achieved if the setting for "open on single-click" is disabled.
What I then see can't be fixed: the type hierarchy sends out null or empty
selection. Type hierarchy should select next/previous element or the type (like
Outline view does).

Martin is there anything the type hierarchy can do to improve this?
