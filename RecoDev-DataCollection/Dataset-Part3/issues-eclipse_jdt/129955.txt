The following question was asked during 3.2 translation.

in file eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring/org/eclipse/ltk/internal/ui/refactoring/model/ModelMessages.properties 

You find the following strings : 

RejectRefactoringsAction_title=&Reject 
RejectRefactoringsAction_tool_tip=Reject Pending Refactorings 
RejectRefactoringsAction_description=Accepts pending refactorings for the local workspace 

On the 3rd line, "Accepts" should be "Rejects" ? 
Please investigate.

Changing priority to minor.
You are right, it should say "Rejects pending refactorings for the local workspace"
