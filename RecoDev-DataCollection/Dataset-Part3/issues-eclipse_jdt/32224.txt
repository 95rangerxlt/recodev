Build 20030218

1. Enable back-linking in Package Explorer
2. Open Object (in rt.jar)
Observe: An editor on Object.class opens (it shows the attached source). 
However Object.class is not shown in Package Explorer

Note that Alt-Shift-s->Package Explorer doesn't work either.

fixed by removing the check: " if the current selection is a child of the 
newselection then ignore it."

Dirk I can't remember why this check was there do you?

	boolean showInput(Object input) {
		//....		
		if (element != null) {
			// if the current selection is a child of the new
			// selection then ignore it.
			IStructuredSelection oldSelection= 
(IStructuredSelection)getSelection();
			if (oldSelection.size() == 1) {
				Object o= oldSelection.getFirstElement();
				if (o instanceof IJavaElement) {
					ICompilationUnit cu= (ICompilationUnit)
((IJavaElement)o).getAncestor(IJavaElement.COMPILATION_UNIT);
					if (cu != null) {
						if (cu.isWorkingCopy())
							cu= (ICompilationUnit)
cu.getOriginalElement();
						if ( element.equals(cu))
							return false;
					}
	
					IClassFile cf= (IClassFile)
((IJavaElement)o).getAncestor(IJavaElement.CLASS_FILE);
					if (cf != null && element.equals(cf))
						return false;
				}
			}

I don't know it either. This doesn't seem to be my code.
Erich, did the fix go in RC1? I'm still seeing the problem. It seems to happen 
if I use a 'JRE System Library'. If I use a JRE_LIB classpath variable, then 
Object.class is shown in Package Explorer.  
There are two problems with classes in JARs and Show In/back linking. Only one 
of them is fixed in RC1. The other problem related to JRE_CONTAINER is still 
open and described in bug# 31683. This one is planned for RC2.

Sorry for closing this bug prematurely.
