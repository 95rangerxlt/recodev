If I cancel the TypeSelection2Dialog, a call to org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.util.History.save() 
is made unnecessarily - this action causes file I/O to occur.
This could cause a noticeable delay in closing the dialog if the user is running a workspace on the network.

Steps:
Open preferences dialog
Go to Java > JUnit page
Select Add Class button
Cancel the dialog that comes up
