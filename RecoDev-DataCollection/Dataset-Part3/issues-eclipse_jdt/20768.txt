For the method (in the class being tested) with the signature
  "static double[] applyPixelEncoding(double[][] pm, double value[])"

and for which another method exists with the same name but different signature,
the wizard generates the method in the test class

  "public void testApplyPixelEncoding[DArrayDArray() {}"

  "public void testApplyPixelEncoding[DArrayDArray() {}"
Still exists under M5 2.1.
test case:
public class T {
	static double[] applyPixelEncoding(double[][] pm, double value[]){
		return null;
	}
	static double[] applyPixelEncoding(){
		return null;
	}
}
