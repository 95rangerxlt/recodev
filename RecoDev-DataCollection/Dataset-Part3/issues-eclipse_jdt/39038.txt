"getButtonHeigthHint" should be spelled "getButtonHeightHint". The "Height" 
part is spelled incorrectly. This is an internal API -- package 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.util -- so this is not a user-visible bug, 
strictly speaking, but it would be trivial to fix.

Actually, now I see other related misspellings, such as 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.wizards.dialogfields.LayoutUtil.setHeigthHint . So 
more generally, it would be nice to replace all occurrences of "Heigth" 
with "Height".
Have to check if they are public API. If not we should correct them.
Fixed.
