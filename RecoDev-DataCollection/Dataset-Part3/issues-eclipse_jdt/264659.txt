The "New Java Class" Dialog has the mnemonic "(" for creating a main method.
I think this is rather unusable - I think "m" would be a better choice here.

Fixed in HEAD.
Available in builds > N20090211-2000.
"b" is what we had before (bug 201978), but that conflicts with "< Back" if you go via the New wizard (Ctrl+N).

"m" conflicts with "Na&me";

Fixed in HEAD to "v" (which only conflicts if there's an enclosing type).
oops.
Sorry Dani - my fault :/
