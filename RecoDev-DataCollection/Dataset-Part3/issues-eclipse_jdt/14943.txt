I performed the following scenario:
1. Created a new class 
2. Added a method.
3. Defined a local variable for an array
4. Used code assist to create a for loop with temporary variable.
The resulting code has LF as linefeeds on a windows machine. They should be 
CR/LF.

templates without formatting have to convert the line delimiters.

If no code formatting is done, it uses the line delimiter which is given by
the document. If the document has no line delimiters, it will use the platform's
default line delimiter.
