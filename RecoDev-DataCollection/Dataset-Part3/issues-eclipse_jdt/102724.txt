3.1

Method TextInputWizardPage#textModified(String) has as last statement a method 
invocation "setPageComplete(validateTextField(text))".

validateTextField(String) is spec'd to return null if no problem occurred 
during validation.

setPageComplete(RefactoringStatus) however does not accept a null argument.

Good catch.
Fixed.
