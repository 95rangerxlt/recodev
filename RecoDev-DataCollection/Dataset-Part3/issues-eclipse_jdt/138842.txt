As of N20060426-0010 (but not as of RC1A), plugins that contain annotation processors are not showing up in the Factory Path project properties pane.

They used to get loaded via annotation processor factory loader initialization code in the plugin's startup() method, but that code was removed to solve a different bug.  Now they are not getting loaded at all until a build (with annotation processing enabled) happens.  Actually, since annotation processing is short-circuited if there are no factories for a project, I am not certain they will get loaded even then.

Fixed.  We now initialize the plugin maps lazily.
