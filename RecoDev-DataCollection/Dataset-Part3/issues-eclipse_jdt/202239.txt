Adding to this, can we also use different strings for Ids and names? Though it does not cause problems, using fully qualified name for an id is recommended.

From TemplateContextType Java Doc:

 * Creates a context type with an identifier. The identifier must be unique, a qualified name is suggested.


Unfortunately we can't change that now as the ID is in the plugin.xml and hence can be used/referenced by others who contribute templates to it.

proposed fix

This fixes the issue by calling the default constructor in TemplateContextType which is allowed for subclass constructors.
Thanks Benno!

Fixed in HEAD.
