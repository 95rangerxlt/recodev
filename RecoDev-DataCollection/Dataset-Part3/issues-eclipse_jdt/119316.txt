I have dne some refactoring of the Team logical model support classes. Basically, I have moved several class from Team UI to Team Core. I have left stubs in Team UI so that LTK and JDT UI compile but they will not work until they are refactored to use the Core classes. I have also added an abstract class, ResourceMappingMerger,  for IResourceMappingMerger. The LTK/JDT merger should subclass this.
