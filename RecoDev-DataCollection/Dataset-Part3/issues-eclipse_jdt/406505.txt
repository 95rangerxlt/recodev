Test case to reproduce the issue

Use the attached testcase to open in ASTViewer, select the type parameter F to see the AST in the viewer.

ASTViewer bailed out with error message: "could not create ast, bad ast node structure". 
This is due to incorrect source positions of the parent node if there are annotations.

I don't see the error bug I do see the marker annotation being tagged as malformed. Assigning to Manoj.

Jay: Please do the following:

 - make sure that the AST api level is 8 (in case this was missed)
 - follow the steps outlined in comment 8 of bug 404489.

The error should be visible once the above steps are complete.

Patch looks good. Please remove the redundant ';' which is causing a warning.
Released the fix here:
