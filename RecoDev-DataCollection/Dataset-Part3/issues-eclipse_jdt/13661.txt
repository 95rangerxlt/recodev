Steps:
1. Click on Window->Preferences
2. Open Java->Editor or Java->Compiler

The widgets used to select options (Combo boxes or color selection boxes) are 
right-aligned, and the labels are left aligned, leaving a large space between. 
This problem is magnified if the user opens a page that is wider than the 
default width, "stretching" the preference page dialog box. It takes more than 
a glance for the user to realize which labels line up with which widgets.

See the Ant->Console page for an example of a better layout. In Ant->Console, 
the widgets are aligned, but appear closer to their labels.

It is preferable to have the values left aligned, or even ragged edge, than to 
have them so far from their label (there's an item on this in the GUI Bloopers 
book).

combo boxes are now as close to the text as possible. (depends on the longest 
label).
We also tried right aligned labels, but this looks not good.
