Srikanth, could it be that you're running against an old target platform or a target that replaces org.junit 4.11 with an older version?

Indeed, I toggle between 3.8.2 and 4.3 M6 based IDEs and noticed it in the
window I was using the former. Reverted via: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=28a0f94188bd26e1014d346f5919c1c6d87c7904.

Sorry about the confusion, thanks.
