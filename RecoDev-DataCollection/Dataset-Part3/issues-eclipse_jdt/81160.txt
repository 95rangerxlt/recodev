Content Assist after @param tag does not propose the type parameter <T>.

Martin, any comments. Do we want to put this into the current implementation or
is the idea to push everything down to JDT/Core. If so, how realistic is this
for 3.1.
It's probably not difficult to add that in our code, but I guess jdt.core will
rewrite all anyways, so I'm waiting with any javadoc code assist fixes
OK, tagging as 3.1 then. I will talk to Philippe regarding the rewrite.
Philippe, are the plans in JDT/Core to provide content assist in Javadoc for 3.1
Philippe, can you please comment what the JDT/Core plans are regarding content
assist in Javadoc.
Codeassist in javadoc is on the radar for 3.1M6, though not super critical on
our list. If not shooting for it (depending on 1.5 effort evolution), then you
may be required to provide the fix. I suggest you wait a little on it.
Philippe, did anything happened here.
Codeassist in javadoc will not occur for 3.1, given the UI support is good
enough (we have some functionality). We released support for selecting in
javadoc, but that's it for 3.1.
Martin, since we don't have JDT/Core support for this in 3.1 can we add this in
the UI ?
