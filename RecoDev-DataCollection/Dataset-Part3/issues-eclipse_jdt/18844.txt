Build F2

The new 'Hide Fields' icon in the Outline view is confusing.

First, the 'F in a circle' motif is overloaded, since it means 'Final' in the 
debugger.

Also, when the 'F' is crossed out, the slash mostly obscures the shorter arm 
of the F, making it resemble a capital lambda more than an F.

Created attachment 1187
blown up view of icon
Created attachment 1189
real blown up view of icon
Sorry - the first attachment is bogus.
we keep the motif, notice that final is shown differently there (an adornment).
we do an iteration on improving the existing icon
new improved icon is in 0706
