	a. the parameter hints should give me more information - parameter type information is already present 
		in the code assist shell. i'd expect parameter names, not types.

	b. the only way i was able to see the hints was right after code completion - how do you see them afterwards? 
		(i.e. to see the hint again without using code completion again)

	re a: I expect both arguments and types. Support for this is on the JCORE plan.

	re b: you can get the signature info by positioning the cursor behind the opening parenthesis.
		we could do better, but we are waiting for an API from JCORE to get the argument hints.
	moving to JCORE.

	Parameter names are currently being added to completion APIs. You would get both in each completion candidate.
	Support released into STABLE (change on ICodeCompletionRequestor).
