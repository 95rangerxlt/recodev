It seems that showing methods in the Type Hierarchy View is reduntant. 
Couldn't we remove it and make the Type Hierarchy Perspective composed by the 
upper part of the Type Hierarchy View (showing the types) plus the outliner?

It would be really nice to at least make it optional to show methods in the type 
hierarchy view.  This could be accomplished by making double-click in the 
sub-pane toolbars cause maximize of that sub-pane, just like the compare 
editors.  I'd like to be able to recreate the VA/Java packages view, with type 
hierarchy in top left, content outline in top right, and editor taking the 
bottom.  Of course this would also mean the type hierarchy would have to allow 
packages as input.
You can now show the hierarchy view only. (in the filers menu) >205

Note that a hierarchy is build on the original elements, but the outliner shows 
the current working copies.

Keeping open for the packages as input.
Now you can also open a hierarchy on packages (and projects and source folders)
