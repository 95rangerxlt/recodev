Build I20020129

"Add Folders..." does not show the project itself. I have to do the following
trick to add an existing folder as class folder:
Press "Create folder"
Enter the name of the existing folder (hopfully it's in the project root :-)
Voilà

BTW: I can't do this a second time - the UI tells me it already exists - which
is OK.
To be consistent with other dialogs "Create Folder" should always warn about
existing projects.
