M5:

Declare some variables like this:

private int v1, v2;

Use v2 in the code.  (You might also have to turn on the compiler option to 
make unused fields a warning not ignored).

Press ctrl-1 on the variable declaration line, select "remove".  

The whole line is removed even though v1 was the only unused variable.
