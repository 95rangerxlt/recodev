everybody seems to be using the ctrl+o outline and i could not convince myself

after a closer look i realized that it's mostly because i cannot customize the 
darn thing - it always presents the same, sorted and unfiltered point of view.
so i cannot use it. :-(

What is your suggestion to fix this? We cannot use the Outline settings and
adding filters would kill the lightweightness.

why can't we use the outline settings?
because
- Java Browsing view has no Outline
- some people use editor only i.e. no Outline no Members view

Not sure if it would be obvious for those people that they have to
1. open Outline view
2. change settings
3. close it again
to configure the lightweight outline control

I agree it would be nice to configure it. Any ideas welcome.
maybe create a common pref page (easily accessible from outline view)
where this would be customizable (?)
maybe we could add a label to the lightweight viewer which says:
"Using Outline view settings for filtering."

sounds ok for a start

As a bare minimum just allow one to turn off fields.  Now that the popup 
outline remembers its size, it is much more attractive.  Unfortunately, we have 
lots of classes that have lots of constants and its a real pain to have to 
scroll scroll to find the things you need.  

ctrl-o works well if you know the name of what you are looking for.  But if you 
are acutally using it as an *outline* (i.e., a high level view of the content) 
then it is frustrating not being able to filter.

I don't know the best solution but to know that pretty much any solution that 
enables filtering will get you a fair number more users (I know several in my 
hall that don't use it because there is no filtering). We can work from there 
to improve.  Heck, I don't even care if it is a preference page for "show 
fields in popup outline".  Personally I'll only have to set that once.
Improvements for the light-weight outline are on the M8 plan. Part of it has 
been resize/restore location. 
The Quick controls now have a view menu. The Quick Outline supports:
- filtering
- sorting
- go into top level type
