When I collapse a comment block, I'd like the first line the folded comment to 
appear on the (single) line representing the collapsed text. In JavaDoc 
comments especially, the first line / first sentence is conventionally a one-
liner "summary" entry used for indexes and tables of contents, and showing it 
on the folded line would be a good visual reminder of the content of the 
comment.

In implementing this idea, I am thinking of something like this: for folded 
comment blocks, look at the second line of the folded text. Discard leading 
punctuation (spaces, tabs, stars) and display the remainder of that second line 
as boxed text with ".." after it. I will attach a mocked-up screen shot 
illustrating this.

AFAICS, this is has been fixed some time ago.
