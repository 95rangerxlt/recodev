I got a NPE on this code
IStatus validation= JavaConventions.validateClasspath(fJavaProject, 
newClasspath, fOutputLocation);
if (!validation.matches(IStatus.ERROR)) {

On debugging I saw that JavaModelStatus.fChildren is null.
Can't see how that happens, but it was.

Any test case on how to reproduce this ?
in BuildPathsBlock, search the validateClasspath line and add
if (!validation.matches(IStatus.ERROR)) {
 System.out.println("Wont be reached");
}
Could you please specify the build number?
still exists in 20020212
When I added the two lines:
if (!validation.matches(IStatus.ERROR)) {
 
System.out.println("Wont be reached");
}

What am I supposed to do to reproduce the 
problem?
add the two lines to BuildPathsBlock.java, after the line containing 
validateClasspath

Run Eclipse, open the new class wizard -> NPE at the added line
I just tried that in 20020212, and it still crashes. seems to be independent of 
the validated classpath.
The bug was due to the order of evaluation. At the time the VERIFIED_OK object is created, the 
fgChildren is still null because it is initilized in the clinit after the Java Model Status object 
is created.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
