When saving settings for producing a runnable jar file as an ant script, if you enter a relative filename in the filename box, a message appears suggesting that this will be relative to the workspace root.  However, when the file is actually saved, it is saved relative to the directory eclipse is installed in.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. export > runnable jar file
2. check 'save as ant script'
3. enter a relative path (e.g. 'myproject/exportjar.xml') in the filename box
4. click finish

the file is not produced in the myproject directory of the workspace, but in a new subdirectory of the eclipse program directory.

On re-reading, it seems I may have misinterpreted the message displayed ("The ANT script will be relative to your Workspace") which may have actually been intended to indicate the behaviour that bug 269201 is supposed to be implementing.  But as this behaviour is not implemented (the generated ant script has full path names for the referenced files) the message is erroneous either way.  

And in any case, interpreting the entered path as relative to the eclipse program directory is non-intuitive, to say the least.
