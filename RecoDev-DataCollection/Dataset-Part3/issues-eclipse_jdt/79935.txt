Build: 200411230838

I had a source file with a warning (un-externalized string). I expanded the
annotation rollover in the editor's rule, and opened the context menu (right
clicked).  I then selected Quick Fix from the menu. Nothing happened.  I opened
the context menu again, and then decided to try Ctrl+1.  An error occurred (see
attached log). At this point the context menu and the roll-over disappeared and
were replaced with blank grey squares.  The editor refused to paint after that
point, and I had to close and reopen the editor.  After reopening the editor, I
was unable to reproduce the error.  Selecting "Quick fix" from the context menu
on the annotation roll-over still does not open quick fix though.

hm, unable to reproduce, and neither do I see how this would happen.
I assume that the document was modified while the roll-over was showing - the
remembered style range used to restore the highlighting did then not accurately
describe the region in the widget any longer.
I was able to reproduce several times, but couldn't get precise steps.  I was
able to get stale popups by alt-tabbing to another application while the
roll-over is on - this isn't easy though, you kind of have to move the mouse off
the roll-over as you are alt-tabbing to another application that will cover the
editor area.  Once you have a stale roll-over, you can continue editing the
document while the roll-over is still up (not by typing into the document, but
by executing commands such as Undo/Redo, delete line, etc).  However, I am
unable to reproduce this today in a fresh editor, so I suspect my editor was
already in some strange state before I got the error.
The deactivation detection has been improved for 3.1. Please reopen if you see
this again.
