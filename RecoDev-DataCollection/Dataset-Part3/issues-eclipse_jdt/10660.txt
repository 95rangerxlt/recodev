You can already use the "modify method parameters" refactoring, but 
using "rename" would be more intuitive and often also more efficient.

agree.
3 possible solutions 
.open the 'modify params' dialog
.sneak that one into 'rename temp' - temps and args are the same thing really
.implement a new thing (sub optimal probably)

opting for option 2
if too hard - then 1, then 3
will look into putting it for 2.0 - low prority though
