Execute code assist as indicated below. After the completion is inserted you 
are no longer in the linked edit mode.

public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	for (int i= 0; i < ISharedImages.class.getF<code assist>ields().length; 
i++) {
		String string= ISharedImages.class.getF[i];
			
	}
}
}

It should be fixed up to the point where content assist inserts method call 
completions with parameters. In this case the parameter toggling mode is 
entered.
Approved by Erich and Kai.
20030313 exhibits the expected behavior I described above. Need additional 
information about the scenario.
Could reproduce the problem with Kai. The problem shows up when activating the 
code assist window with the mouse so that the editor looses focus. 
Won't change the focus behavior for 2.1. Removing mile stone.
fixed in M6 or before
