Added JUnit and Javadoc views. Skipped the others, as there is not much to describe in them.

I also updated the following files (Added icons for the commands. This is similar to the docs for debug views and looks better as well)
reference/views/ref-view-package-explorer.htm
reference/views/ref-type-hierarchy.htm
reference/views/ref-view-outline.htm
reference/views/ref-call-hierarchy.htm

Plus corrected a few typos.
Added the links for JUnit and Javadoc views to concepts/concept-java-views.htm.

Fixed in HEAD.
