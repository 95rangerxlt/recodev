have to rename it since '-' is not allowed in an extension point name.

The extension point is internal, but I would like to give them a heads-up.

I've informed the client about this problem and pointed him to this bug.
fixed changed the extension point name so that it uses "_", i.e., it is now:
internal_testRunTabs.exsd
Thanks Erich.

Konrad, please reinstate the check in our validator.
I have turned on the check again.
