while testing switch-on-String support in conditional breakpoints I found that if you have a really long condition and open the breakpoint properties dialog, it will be the entire height of the screen before it will scroll. Consider the following condition:

String test = "two";
switch (test) {
case "one":
	System.out.println("one from condition");
    return true;
case "two":
	System.out.println("two from condition");
	String innertest = "innerone";
	switch(innertest) {
	case "innerone": {
		System.out.println("innerone from inner condition");
		return true;
	}
	default: {
		System.out.println("fail from inner condition");
		return false;
	}
	}
    return true;
case "three":
	System.out.println("three from condition");
    return true;
case "four":
	System.out.println("four from condition");
    return true;
case "five":
	System.out.println("five from condition");
    return true;
default:
	System.out.println("Fail from condition");
	return false;
}

After it opens if you try to resize the properties dialog the condition text editor does not resize, instead the dialog scrolls, which is annoying.

There already was height hint code there, just commented out.

Fixed in HEAD
