From WSAD Customer:

When creating a new Java Class, when an incomplete super-classname is entered 
in the dialogue box and then the “Browse” button is clicked, nothing that 
appears in the “Choose a type” field.  Ideally, it should have the incomplete 
name typed in the previous super-class field.

How to recreate :
In the Java perspective, 
- File -> New ->Class
- In the resulting dialogue box, type "JPan" in the 'Superclass' field.  Now 
click on Browse.
- Ideally, the dialogue box that just opened up should already have JPan 
written in it and hence the list of selectable classes would be shortened.
