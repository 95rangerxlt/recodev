Build 20021216

1. Create folder d:\temp\test\src\p
2. Create file X.java in d:\temp\test\src\p:
package p;
public class X {
}
3. In a fresh workspace, create new Java project
4. Uncheck use default project contents, and point to d:\temp\test
5. Press Finish
Observe: You get an error dialog saying that src/P [in Test] does not exist.

The problem is that the NewProjectWizard is visiting the tree before it adds 
the Java nature to the project. It then asks the compilation 
unit /Test/src/p/X.java for its package declaration. This throws a 
JavaModeException since the project is not a Java project.
