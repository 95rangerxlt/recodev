The following program triggers a verify error when run (operand stack underflow)

// ---
public class X {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		X [][][] x = new X[10][10][];  
	}

Patch that adds testcase and implements fix

The problem here was a switch in the typo anno generation code to using declared dimensions on the call to multianewarray rather than the explicitly specified dimensions.  Part of the code gen needs the explicit information whilst the type annotation generation code needs the declared dimensions. The fix is to pass both.
Patch looks good. Andy please sign off.

Jay, thanks for releasing and resolving this one too.
