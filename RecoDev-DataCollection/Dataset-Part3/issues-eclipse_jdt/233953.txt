3.4 RC2.

We have a hole in our code where editor activation can lead in the creation of two ASTs.
Test Case: run the ActivateJavaEditorTest rev. 1.10 with enabled AST Provider debug option and observe: often the AST for the same element is created twice.

I think the fix is safe and helps reduce the AST creation. Martin, please review and approve if you agree.
After discussion with Martin and trying to produce this via normal UI scenarios without luck we decided to not put this fix into 3.4.
