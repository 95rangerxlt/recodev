Need to support adding jars to the factory path that are project-relative. This

Done.  Note that there are still some rough edges to smooth, e.g., no checking 
for what happens when a specified jar file doesn't exist, no checking for 
whether it's already been added.  Leaving this bug open till that's fixed.
When a specified jar doesn't exist, it is caught during build.  It is 
permissible to add a nonexistent jar to the factorypath; in the situation where 
a project wizard is setting up a project, we don't want to enforce a particular 
ordering of the tasks of configuring the factorypath and installing or creating 
the needed libraries.

The factory path is now stored as a Map<FactoryContainer, ...>, and the 
behavior that happens when an existing container (jar) is added again is 
supported and documented.

So, no rough edges left wrt this bug; resolving as fixed.
