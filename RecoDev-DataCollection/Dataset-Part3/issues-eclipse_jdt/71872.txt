Version: 3.0.1
Build id: 200408111300

The Javadoc view doesn't parse the @link tag when it is inside a @param tag.
Example:

@param a Assigned to the <code>a</code> field, whose value may be gotten by the 
{@link #getA() getA} method.

This is displayed in the Javadoc view literally
... the {@link #getA() getA} method.
