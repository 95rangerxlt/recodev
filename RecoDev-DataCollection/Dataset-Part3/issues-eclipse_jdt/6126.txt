JAR package exports class files even when the build state is dirty.
A dialog telling this should be presented when pressing finish, and allow the

there is no easy way to determine whether there is a need to build.
I suggest that when auto build is turned off we offer a check box
that is on by default "Build project before export"


*** Bug 3757 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Fixed:
- it will now do an incremental build per default (also for already existing jar
descs) if auto building is off
- this can be turned off on the JAR Options page
