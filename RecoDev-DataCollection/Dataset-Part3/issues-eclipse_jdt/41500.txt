see also bug 41501 
As far as I can see, the three classes ...
HistoryAction.java
HistoryDropDownAction.java
HistoryListAction.java
... are +/- the same for typehierarchy and callhierarchy.

There are two minor differences:
- callhierarchy uses IMethod, where typehierarchy uses IJavaElement
- UI strings & icons, and the LabelProvider are different

Approximately the same thing is done in Search in
SearchDrowDownAction.java
ShowSearchAction.java
ShowSearchesAction.java

We should probably refactor them into one framework ("ElementHistory"), where
subclasses only have to supply UI stuff.

Fix for the enablement problem

Patch against org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.callhierarchy.HistoryListAction
fixing the enablement problem when no elements are selected. When everything is
selected, the Remove button should not be enabled IMHO, since this would
prevent the user from exiting the dialog with anything but Cancel.

I have not done anything to the duplicate code issue. If you'd like me to do
something about that problem, I'd like some directions on where to put the
"consolidated" code etc.
Thanks for the fix.

Dirk, what do you think about refactoring the history into a reusable component?
IMO it would be nice, but it's not urgent.
I opt the leave the implemenation as it is.

Markus, can you please review the fix.
The fix is fine (same behavior as the already-commited fix for the same problem
in TypeHierarchy).

It's not possible to remove the last history entry. Removing all history entries
could release unused memory, but would require more code to reset the view to
its default state (which can nowadays be achieved by closing and re-opening the
view).
Fix release to HEAD.
