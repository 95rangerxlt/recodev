a tree-based view should not scroll and expand its nodes all by itself
it's very disturbing

i much preferred the previous behavior
the 'tick' should be propagated up and no auto-expansion or auto-scrolling  
should be done (could be customizable by some view setting)

scrolling and selection can now be disabled.
