In my annotation processor, I want to do quick operations (like validation)
during a reconcile, and slow operations (like generation) during a build. It
would be helpful if the phase were part of the
EclipseAnnotationProcessorEnvironment API so these two cases could be
distinguished. I'm using AnnotationProcessorEnvironment.getOptions() to
determine this now, but the constants involved (in ProcessorEnvImpl) are not
part of the API.
