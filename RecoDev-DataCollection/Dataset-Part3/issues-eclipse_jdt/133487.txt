Find Broken NLS Keys action reports false positives in the accessor class.

1. create Java project P
2. add package p
3. add class T with String s= "foo";
4. externalize with default arguments
5. execute Find Broken NLS Keys action
==> reports failures in Messages classes

Same problem when using Eclipse style NLSing.

fixed >  I20060328-0010

With additional null check on sourceRange
