The JUnit package test runner doesn't run TestCases that don't contain any 
test* methods themselves (but instead only inherit them). Consider the 
following example:

public class SimpleTest
  extends TestCase
{
  public void testParser()
  {
    Parser p = getParser();
    assert(...);
  }
  
  protected Parser getParser()
  {
    return new SimpleParser();
  }
}


// Not executed, unless a dummy test method is inserted!
public class ExtendedTest
  extends SimpleTest
{
  protected Parser getParser()
  {
    return new ExtendedParser();
  }
}

The problem is still here in 3.1M2
This is also described in bug 56951.
When you select a project and say 'Run as Junit Test' there is code that
collects all classes that contain methods starting with 'test'.
The correct procedure would be to find out which classes are subclasses of TestCase.

Patch

This patch allows to find all TestCases (even if they do not contain a test*
method). But if a user tries to run such a test, JUnit will produce a warning
because there are no test* methods (however, TestCases with test* methods will
execute normally).

However, searching for test cases in a project will not find test cases that
might be in .jar or .zip files imported in that project.
Erich, could you comment on that? Would it be necessary to search in .jar or
.zip files, too?

Patch

Additionally, this new patch forces the search engine not to search vor suite()
methods in .jar and .zip files.

Patch #3

Martin, I think this one should be right. If not, then let me know, please.
the progress monitor handling is not correct, can you have a look at that?

Patch #4

The progress monitor should now work fine (but only with the great help of
Martin!)
