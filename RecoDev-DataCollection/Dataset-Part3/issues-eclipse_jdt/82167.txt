The correct plural of "parenthesis" is "parentheses".

I would find it more convenient, if the characters of the bracket classes would
also be part of the preference names, e.g.:
- (Parentheses), [square] and <angular> brackets
- {Braces}

or
- Parentheses(), square[] and angular<> brackets
- Braces{}

Oops, I realized that <angular brackets> completion currently cannot be toggled
at all.
Actually, "angle bracket" seems to be more common than "angular bracket".
I've fixed the wording.
