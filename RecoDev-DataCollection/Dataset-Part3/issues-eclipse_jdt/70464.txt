In the code fragment below,
(1) the Tooltip is Wrong, type shows as 'String[][]' in stead of 'String[]'
(2) Code Completion Fails, 'no code completions available' appears in the 
statusbar.


public class Test {
  static private void test() {
    List list = new LinkedList();
    Iterator i = list.iterator();
    while (i.hasNext()) {
      String [] elms = (String [])i.next(); // (1) Tooltip Wrong
      elms.  // (2) Code Completion Fails
    }
  }
}

Which tooltip, i.e. where do you hover?

Tooltip and code assist work for me using Eclipse SDK 3.0.
Created attachment 13528
jpeg with screen capture

This contains a screen capture with the tooltip. The mouse hovers over 'elms'
at that time.
I do use the Cheetah06 JDT core. Maybe that makes it different from the 
regular 3.0 base?
yes.
(1) is coverd by bug 68631.
Works in 3.1 M4
