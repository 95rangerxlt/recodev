Build F2. We will update this with results for F3 as soon as possible.

There is no mnemonic in the Refactoring menu for Self Encapsulate.

1) Pick a project that has an item which is Self Encapsulatable...
2) Bring up the context menu for the item in the package explorer.
3) Go refactoring
4) There is no mnemonic for Self Encapsulate.

I will attach a screencap...
