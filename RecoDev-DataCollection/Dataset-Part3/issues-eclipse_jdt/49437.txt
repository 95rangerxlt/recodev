Copy and paste seems to be much slower than it was under the 2.x versions of
eclipse.  Normally I wouldn't submit this as a bug, except I have seen it take a
LONG time to finish the paste operation.  (copy finishes quickly).

This works fine for small source files, however when I get to a source file
which is over 6000 lines long, it can take a few minutes for copy and paste to work.

I have verified the slow paste operation with eclipse build M6 using a PC for
both Windows XP and Suse 9.0.

I assume that you are using copy/paste in the editor.
"Paste for correct indentation" causes this.
Tom, please have a look.

Reduced severity back to normal since there's a workaround (disable the preference).

see also bug 48753
fixed, smart paste no longer re-indents the pasted text, but only shifts it to
the correct level.

- the shift value is determined from the second pasted line (as the first one
might not be an entire line).
