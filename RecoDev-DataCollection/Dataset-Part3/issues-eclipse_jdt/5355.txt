i have a pointer to IMethod in hand
(this method happens to be declared in a working copy)
when i search using SearchEngine::searchDeclarationsOfReferencedTypes
i get an NPE because underlyingResource does not exist for this method

i'd expect the search engine to be smart enough to convert the method to one 
that is declared in a real compilation unit and work on that one.

The SearchEngine should not fix up handles that are passed to it. In case of 
inaccurate search, then you should use the string based API (i.e. no wildcards 
with Java elements).

Now we should not raise a NPE in this case. 
Jerome, can you please check our behavior in latest ? If ok, then close this 
defect.
There is no NPE any longer, but we find no matches. Need to fix.
If the enclosing element is contained in a working copy, this working copy now 
takes precence over the original compilation unit.
