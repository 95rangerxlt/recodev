I'm seeing a similar error when doing the same process, except the specific error is (for my project which is called OSS SWDI R5):

"element not found: /swdi"

It has the strange behaviour that when I link a source folder, specifying the location of the source and name for the containing folder in my eclipse project, it only seems to add the first thing it finds, then throws the error above.

So it adds the first folder from my linked source, then stops with error. I hit f5 and it adds the next folder or source file it finds, then displays the error again and stops. The behaviour is the same every time I hit f5. Link to the next single directory or source file, then bomb out. So every time I hit f5 I get one more file or directory in my workspace from the linked folder.

This was not the case in 3.3, so either 3.3.1 or 3.3.1.1 broke something with source folder linking.


Hi David

Can you please provide exact steps of what you are doing? With my steps it is not possible to create the linked folder, because the error status is shown on the linked source folder dialog and hence the finish button is not enabled.

Thanks
Hey Marcus,
Played around with this a bit since I posted. I installed a completely clean version of Eclipse (I used the JAVA developer distribution), and setup a new workspace. When I tried to reproduce the issue, I could not.
In my old Eclipse setup, it was slightly messier. I had multiple projects, and many plugins installed.
I'll try and reproduce my fault by first adding more projects (many projects linked to the same set of source). If that does not work, I'll try adding plugins from the old Eclipse environment.
The problem is that we change c:\foo\bar to /P01/foo/bar and then org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace.validateLinkLocation(IResource, IPath) says that foo is not accessible, which is correct: foo does not exist.
