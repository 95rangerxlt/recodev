- create Test CU 

public class A  { // comment
	public void foo() {
		System.out.println("Dirk");
		System.out.println("Dirk");
	}
}

- position cursor on first line containing System.out....
- press Shift+Cursor Down to select line

observe:

actions receive two selection change events: first with length 31 second with 
length zero.

The second selection change event with length zero disables the refactoring 
actions extract method, extract local variable and extract constants although 
there is a valid selection.
