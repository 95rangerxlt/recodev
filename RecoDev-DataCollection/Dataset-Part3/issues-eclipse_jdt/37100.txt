known minor problem
refactoring the imports too seems to be a more general problem

it occurs at move method (old imports not deleted) and 
at inline method (new imports not added)

and at some more places (I do not remember at the moment),
e.g. import xx.yy.* instead of xx.yy.ZZ;

We improved import handling for move and inline for 3.0:

- inline does now generate needed imports
- move doesn't generate star imports anymore and only inserts those 
  types needed.
