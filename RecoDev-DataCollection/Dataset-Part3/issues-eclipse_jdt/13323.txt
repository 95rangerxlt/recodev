Build 20020409

In the handleLabelProviderChanged method in ProblemTreeViewer a changed event 
on a resource is adapted to the Java elements it represents but the change is 
not propagated.

As a result when the CVS decorator is turned on the ProblemTreeViewer is not 
decorated.

The last line 

LabelProviderChangedEvent e= new LabelProviderChangedEvent((IBaseLabelProvider)
event.getSource(), mapped);

should read

super.handleLabelProviderChanged(new LabelProviderChangedEvent
((IBaseLabelProvider)event.getSource(), mapped));
