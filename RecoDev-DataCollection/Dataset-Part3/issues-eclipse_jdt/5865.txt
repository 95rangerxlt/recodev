I can currently modify what is shown in the "New" submenu of the navigator.  
This is modified under Perspective->Customize->New Wizards.  The "New" submenu 
in the packages view does not seem to obey this customization.  It would be nice 
to support this, because I often, for example, want to create a non-java file 
from the packages view, but I can't get this into the "New" submenu.

There is an inconsistency in that the New menu item in the packages view is 
context sensitive. This means depending on the selection you get different new 
actions. This is consistent with the goal to only have actions in a menu that 
make sense for a particular selection. This results in shorter sub menus. The 
trade-off is context sensitivity vs. user customizability. When we did the 
context menu there was no support for user customizability, so I'm willing to 
revist this. Opinion - Kevin?
My initial reaction would be to suggest that consistency is the preferred 
option. However, the workbench is NOT being consistent in this case either. The 
usability review uncovered a mismatch between the new menu that appears in the 
menu and toolbar vs the one that appears in the navigator. 




consistency + support for customizability are strong arguments for changing the 
current behaviour.
I agree
Discussing with EG. We will change it to support the action set customization.
I added the Source Folder Wizard to the plugin.xml so it can be added to an 
action set.
switched to the NewWizardAction
