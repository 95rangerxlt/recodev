1)select a method X.y()
2) Press Shift+F2

Two problems here
1) opens on the class and not on the method detail
2) opens the browser even if the method is not there (e.g. private method)
==> a dialog should inform that the method is not JDoced and ask if JDoc on the
class should be opened

Problem 1 is real and should be fixed. It seems that the action never opens on 
a method.

Problem 2: current behaviour is acceptable.
1. is now fixed with using the help brwser.
(it was a browser bug. The URL contains the correct anchor, but this is ignored 
by the external browser.)

2. We have know idea how the Javadoc was generated (You can specify to include 
private fields). Fixing this is very expensive (get the page content, parse!)
