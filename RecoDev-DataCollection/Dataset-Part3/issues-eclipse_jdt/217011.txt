I am opening this to cover PDE in the case where the user does something very unorthodox.  We had bug 209510 opened when a user tried to run a plug-in compiled with 1.4 with junit4.  When I tried this with the regular junit launcher, I did not get any errors in the launch dialog, only after I clicked Run did I find out it did not work.

PDE uses JUnitLaunchConfigurationTab directly from debug.  So if we could add logic to JUnitLaunchConfigurationTab to verify the JRE version is 1.5 or greater when using Junit4, it would solve the problem in both the traditional JUnit launcher and PDE's JUnit launcher.  Though this could very well be wishful thinking :)

This tab actually comes from the JUI component.

proposed fix

This is a proposed fix for verifying JUnit 4 is running on a JRE of 1.5 or higher.

I modified JUnitLaunchConfigurationTab to include reference to the ILaunchConfiguration, just as is done in JavaJRETab.  Then during validation the ILaunchConfiguration is used to get a JRE.  If the JRE version is set, I get the JRE version the same way as JavaJRETab checks project version compliance.

The JavaJRETab needed a slight one line modification to make sure the error disappears if the user updates the JRE to 1.5 or better.  This issue is also the same reason I had to add the Junit 4 validation to JUnitLaunchConfigurationTab.isValid().

updated patch

Updated the patch as it did not remove the error message if the user corrected the problem on the JRE page.
Increasing severity to normal as this would fix bug 209510.  

If there is anyway we could put this fix in for M5, I would really appreciate it!
released an updated patch for the JDT.UI changes > 20080131

I played around and it seems to work. Is the debug patch really required?
Moving to debug.

Without the debug part, when the user updates the JRE the Junit/JRE validation will not run.  For example, user chooses JUnit4, switches to the JRE tab, selects 1.4, they will not see any problems.  When the switch back to the JUnit tab, they will then see an error (even though all they have done is switch tabs).  The debug part really helps the usability.


I see the dialog updating properly without the debug patch - just using the latest contents from HEAD it seems to work OK.

You are completely correct.  It appears I was mistaken, it seems the debug piece of the patch is not necessary.  

Thanks Darin for your time on this bug and thank you Martin for getting the Junit piece of the patch into HEAD so quickly!
Marking as fixed and moving to JUI.
Fixed.
