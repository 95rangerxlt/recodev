I have set my syntax highlighting colors. 
They use white foreground and black background for comments.
In Preferences
 Java
   Code Generation
      Code & Comments

If I edit an comment entry, eg Types
I can not see the comments as it is using the syntax
highlighting setting of white foreground but does
not use the syntax highlighted background (black)
but uses a default background of white.
So I get white on white.
It needs to either use all syntax highlight colors
including background or default colors or no colors.
