Organize imports will flash and potentially scroll the editor even if there isn't anything to do. Also, clients listening for document rewrite sessions may suspend their activity and resume it afterwards, which incurrs some overhead.

The applyTextEdit method should at least check whether the text edit contains any changes, and not start/stop a rewrite session if it does not.

I will attach a patch.

Adds a check for no-op text edits and returns doing nothing in that case. Unless the save flag is set - we still do the whole thing in this case to make sure the target gets modified  and saved as expected.
Markus, please approve for RC2 (in case there's a rebuild).
Approved.
