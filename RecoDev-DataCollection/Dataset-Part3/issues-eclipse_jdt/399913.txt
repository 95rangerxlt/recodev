1.4 EE file

I20130130-2000

Went to the installed JREs page after the latest JVM update on my Mac only to find that my Java 1.6 JRE was not there, so I hit search and it still did not show up. Debugged my host Eclipse and found that because I have an EE file to describe a 1.4 VM - that points to the 1.6 location - the actual 1.6 VM is not shown on the page (it is still found via the plist parsing).

Steps
1. grab the EE file I attached
2. make a VM install for the EE file
3. hit the search button on the installed JREs page
4. notice there is no 1.6 JRE added to the list - you can do this in a new or existing workspace

I looked at the logic in the page and there is a check based on location of the VM that is likely causing the bug.

I looked at the logic in the page and there is a check based on location of the VM that is likely causing the bug.
This was caused by the commit: 

http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=159480c84f7f681d88f2e7f6d7e065a97895d613

where I changed the check from VM id to install location hoping to prevent a duplicate name problem while searching (bug 401358).

Reverted the path / id changes and it works just fine again:
