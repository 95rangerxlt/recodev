I20051206-1200

Steps to reproduce:
- Using WinXP, Java editor font set to system default (Tahoma, 9, regular)
- Enable line number ruler
- Scroll Java editor

-> Line number ruler seems badly synchronized with the scrolled lines
-> After some scrolling, the line numbers are displayed with some offset from the actual line
-> Seems to occur with variable space fonts only

This happens regardless whether folding is enabled or not, or any elements are collapsed.
Strange enough, the defect manifests itself only in small Java files with small scrolling range, such as "RefactoringResourceMapping". Bigger files such as "JavaCore" do not exhibit this behavior.
Also on GTK.
Dirk sees this too, using Courier New 10 and XP style SWT.
