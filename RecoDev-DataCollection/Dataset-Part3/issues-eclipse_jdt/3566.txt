Import the source from ott7f\moss:\prs\replicat\archive\phoenix\1g9tg06\VA0051_GrosseKlasse.java in a java project.
	Open this compilation unit. The CPU goes to 100% for a long time before the outliner displays the structure.

	The actual parsing time is really small. The problem comes from the display of the resulting structure.

Source used to reproduce the problem
The problem still exists in 20020214.

The most critical issue is that if you open the class from the package view a 
new editor tab appears immediately but no editor contents is shown and the UI 
seems to be dead for 6 seconds on my 1GHz machine.

A solution would be to show the editor contents immediately and to start 
building the outline tree from a separate (low priority) thread.

Build 20020423 improves outliner performance.
