Type the following line in a Java editor

return new String();

now position the cursor to the right of the 'w' in new and try to edit the 
line to show.

return new Object[] {new String(), new String()};

Everytime you type the { character it gets appended to the end of the line.

Typing the line from scratch works except you seem to get an extra space or 2 
before the { characer.
