When coding Java:

If I type in a code block such as the following we have a one line if statement 
that does not need brackets around it.

if (bool)
   synchronized (this) {
      // doSomething
   }

If right click and select format the format incorrectly formats this code to:

if (bool)
   synchronized (this) {
      // doSomething
}

It correctly associates the opening brace with synchronized, but incorrectly 
associates the closing brace with the if statement.  This is pretty annoying.

Formatting java code is supplied by JDT. Moving defect report
moving to JDT Core
Is this one easy to fix ? If not, then we will revisit post2.0.
Need to investigate.
Fixed and released in HEAD. Regression tests added.
