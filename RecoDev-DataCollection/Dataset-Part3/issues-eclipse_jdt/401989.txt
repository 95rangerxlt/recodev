I was alerted by code in LocalDeclaration.analyzeCode() which relies on methodScope.referenceMethod() to perform "can be static" analysis, the latter method returning null within lambda expressions.
While that particular piece of code might actually be OK, I noticed a problem with the following program:

interface I {
	void make();
}
public class Nesting {
	int val;
	private I test() {
		return () -> System.out.print(val);
	}
	public void call() { test().make(); }
}

When enabled, the following bogus warning is issued:
  The method test() from the type Nesting can be declared as static

We should check what exactly is missing to let lambda expressions participate in this analysis.

The interest in this is really two-fold:
  (1) When the lambda uses anything non-static, we must to turn off the 'This method can be static'-diagnosis for any potentially enclosing methods, same as was the task in bug 378674. This may have been fixed already, or can be fixed easily by extending the current resetXxx-calls in MethodScope.
  (2) We need to know it the lambda method itself can be static, i.e. if it requires a this in its MethodHandle, basically if any non-static references escape. If I'm not mistaken, this may happen even if the lambda uses type parameters from it's enclosing context, like this:

class Calculator<T extends Number> {
  public Supplier<List<T>> dummySupplier() = {
    return () ->Collections.emptyList();
  }
}

The lambda can be static due to type erasure -- in fact it could be entirely stateless (3) (but is there an optimization for that?) Right?

I'll start fixing (1), but (2) and (3) requires a separate flag. Or should (2) and (3) be checked at code-generation time from looking at the bindings in the MethodScope for the lambda instead?

A lambda method provides an implementation of an interface method and as
such can only be an instance method.

Please note that your original fix released into master is not cherry picked
into BETA_JAVA8 yet - will be done shortly though.

I think the piece that needs special handling is MethodScope's ReferenceContext
not being AbstractMethodDeclaration but instead a LambdaExpression.

Right -- but creating that particular method is the job of the LambdaMetafactory [1]. I'm talking about the 'lambda implementation method', i.e. the one that gets wrapped in the MethodHandle, e.g. lambda$1, as referenced in the constant pool. That particular method can be static or not.

This is done.

OK, I understand now what you meant. I'll take care of this part.
This is fixed along with bug 406319. Test released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=b15d555969226382f7ca55d85fc45725a266fc8b.

Other concerns in comment#1 are either already addressed or will be
through bug 406392.

Jesper, can you post the full code for this test case please ? TIA.
