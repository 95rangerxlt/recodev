The checkboxes in the Factory Path dialog, which are supposed to determine 
whether the corresponding container is enabled or not, are not working.  
Specifically, changing the state of a checkbox is not recognized as a change in 
the "changeSettings" method.  This seems likely to be something related to a 
FactoryPath.Attributes getting copied by reference rather than cloned.

Quite so.
