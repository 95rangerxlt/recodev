If the TestResult of JUnit test performed contains several failures/errors, only one is shown.

As a result, it makes unconvenient investigating the faulty tests that execute several threads and each failed thread adds error/failure to the TestResult, since only one fault can be viewed and this fault can be result of fault in other thread. See http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-p5.html as an example of such tests.

I faced the same problem especially with junit4. 
The thing is that there can be a failure/error in the test method but also additionally in the @After method. Currently you see only the last failure/error from the @After method, but interesting is usually the 1st failure/error, cause it can cause the 2nd one.
This is very annoying. Especially if you have a subclass ecosystem where for example a root class cleans the db after each test or a mockery is check for satisfaction.

Should show all traces in the Failure Trace pane. Tentatively targetting 3.5.

Patch to report the first error instead of the last error

Attached a quick hack to display the more interesting first error instead of the usually uninteresting last error.

Fixed in HEAD. We now show all failures reported by JUnit in the Failure Trace pane.

Great, thank you!
