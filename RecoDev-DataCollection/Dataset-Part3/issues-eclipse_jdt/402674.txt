Proposed Patch
(In reply to comment #2)

Some misc issues were found while doing a sanity check and have filed bug 403417 for the same as the issues are not related to null binding of lambda.
Fix and test released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=6ebd66d084b36e21840502fb2a7d814341a3b190.

(Please include the bug summary in the tests in future, so it
become easier to understand what is being tested.)

Thanks Manoj.
