Quite often (particularly with enums) it's useful to have a static import of
foo.Bar.* even if normally you like to have everything imported separately.

It would be great to have a separate option for this under the Organize Imports
preferences page - currently whenever I organize imports (which I do frequently)
all static imports are separated out, meaning that when I next need to use a
member of the type in question, if I haven't used it before I need to do it
explicitly.
