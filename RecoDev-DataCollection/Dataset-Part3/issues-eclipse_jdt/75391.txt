I like the new feature to generate serialVersionUID's automatically instead of 
using serialver. 
 
Unfortunately this tool fails with a NoClassDef for certain classes: here a 
class extending HttpServlet on Eclipse-3.1.0.

I'm not sure what this is...passing onto JDT.
sorry for the poor report.

I have a class extending javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet. When I use Ctrl+1 and
choose to add a calculated serialUID, nothing happens.

The logfile shows the reported NoClassDef. It worked fine for serialUID
generation for classes extending for example java.lang.Exception. I assume the
referenced servlet-api is not included in the classpath for the serialUID
calculation. 

eclipse version is 3.1.0, i can paste the complete stack later.
Checked detached from my current work in a separate project. 
Works for referenced external jars but not for jars in the same project. 
Serial version calculation now launches a separate VM

On 3.1 M6 it seems broken.

\T,
Incidently,
The VM lauched cannot be stopped either...
I would consider the problem is related to the Classpath as creating an empty
class allowed to have it quick fixed.

Version: 3.1.0
