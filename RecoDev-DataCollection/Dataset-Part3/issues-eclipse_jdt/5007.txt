Sorry, tab+enter did me in.  I'll try and finish my bug reports before I submit
them in the future :).

Setup:

Project A: contains compilation unit FooBar.java

public class FooBar {
  public void foo() {
    new foo.Bar();
  }
}
Project B: contains _class_folder_ classes, in classes is package foo, in foo is
classfile Bar.class

The compilation error message in the task list is "foo cannot be resolved or is
not a type".

Now add project B to the classpath of project A.  The error does not go away,
even though foo.Bar is clearly a part of project B.
Closed - not reproducable with new builder.

All classpath changes using the new builder result in the entire project being 
rebuilt.
