starting up in the resourece perspective is wrong for those people who download 
the sdk to develop java code
(which is just about everybody)

Erich, any news on that? 
it annoys me to no end that 'go to workbench' in the welcome page takes me to
the raw resource perspective which is completely useless on its own.
Adam - I fully agree.
The only issue is that switching to the Java perspective loads JDT and as a 
consequence slows down the start-up. Startup time is an area where we were 
highly sensitive for 3.0.
This was done for 3.1
