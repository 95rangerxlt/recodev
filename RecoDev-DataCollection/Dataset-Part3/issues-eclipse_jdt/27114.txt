i don't know how to fix but this one is major
when JavaEditor.dispose is called, getSourceViewer().getTextWidget() is already 
null

so the mouseListener is never deregistered as a propertyChangeListener on the
IPreferenceStore

this causes the mouseListener to stick around forever, which means its 
enclosing instance is immortal too 
(it being a CompilationUnitEditor you can imagine the size of the leak)
seems that StyleRanges/Line do not leak here anymore - things get unregistered 
correctly (deregistration done before returning)

opened bug StyleRanges for leaking OS resources

bug 27962, that is
