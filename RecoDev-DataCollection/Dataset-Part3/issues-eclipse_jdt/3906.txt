2. extract the selected line to a method m

We can accept this limitation, suggest to defer.
Reactive check if new method name conflicts with old method name. It got 
disabled since we overloafding case wasn't handled correctly


You get an error message saying that method m() already exists in A.

Fixed in build > 20021224
The test case now generates an exception.
Tested against I2002026
==>
Changed to P1 and major because an "unexpected error" dialog comes up (see
attached picture)
Created attachment 404
Bad error message
Daniel, can you please drop by. The test case again works for me. I am not able 
to reproduce the problem.
No longer reproducable in 20020307: the user gets a correct warning that m is
already defined in A.
