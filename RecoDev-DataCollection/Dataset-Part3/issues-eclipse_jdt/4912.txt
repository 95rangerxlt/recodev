1) Create a Java Project called MyProject
2) Select the .classpath file in the My Project folder
3) Choose Copy from the context menu of the Packages view
4) Try to select My Project as the destination of the copy.

Notice that the "OK" button never gets enabled.

This scenario happens for the SWT team on numerous occassions - we have 
a .classpath_win32 file which we want to copy to .classpath when compiling the 
windows source.  We have to go to the Navigator view to do this.
We used to be able to do this from the Packages view.
