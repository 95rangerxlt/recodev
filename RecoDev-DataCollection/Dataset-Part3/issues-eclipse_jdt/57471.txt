system:
Linux slackware 9.1
garnome 0.30.1
jdk 1.4_03

upto M5 it works great. installing (clean) anything higher then that will make
eclipse crash with only the following in a dialog box, no logs whatsoever:
JVM terminated. Exit code=1
/opt/java/bin/java
-cp /mnt/temp/tt/eclipse/./startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
-os linux
-ws gtk
-arch x86
-showsplash /mnt/temp/tt/eclipse/./eclipse -showsplash 600
-shared /mnt/temp/tt/eclipse/./eclipse -shared 53a000d
-vm /opt/java/bin/java
-vmargs
-cp /mnt/temp/tt/eclipse/./startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main

Do youi have anything in the log or can you provide a VM dump. We are using M8 
under Linux Gnome every day and it works fine.
I have searched for a log or a dump file, but cannot find anything.

Just tell me how to get one and I will do so
don't know if this will help but just before it crashes this gets printed in the
terminal:

(eclipse:7308): GLib-CRITICAL **: file gstrfuncs.c: line 2129 (g_strsplit):
assertion `string != NULL' failed
 
(eclipse:7308): GLib-CRITICAL **: file gstrfuncs.c: line 2241 (g_strjoinv):
assertion `str_array != NULL' failed

upgrading gtk to the latest version fixed the problem
