When I run a JUnit test case from the Java perspective, the test runner view 
appears in that perspective, then the perspective switches to 'debug', and 
there another JUnit view is opened. Only then are the tests actually run.

This behaviour seems a bit awkward. In particular, I would only want JUnit to 
switch to the debug perspective when there are failing tests, i.e. only after 
the test run. I also only really want one view.

I use Eclipse 2.0, build 20020214.

With the new JUnit launch configuration support you can specify whether the 
perspective should be switched. Please try integration build 20020314 and set 
the preference to use configuration based launching.

Switching to the debug view on error seems attractive but unless you run under 
the debugger this isn't helpful.

However, the problem is still that the JUnit view is shown twice when a 
perspecitve is switched.
Tried it on stable build 20020321. Only one view is opened now. Thanks for 
fixing it.
