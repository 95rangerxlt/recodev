Running eclipse 200303071024 (RC2)?

Trying to use the new testcase and new testsuite wizards and they are causing 
classcastexceptions in my log file.
Additionally, the new testcase function on the toolbar (drop down under the C 
symbol) appears not to get any context information from my current location in 
the package explorer (it picks project/package information randomly).

The last few entries in my log file are attached.
