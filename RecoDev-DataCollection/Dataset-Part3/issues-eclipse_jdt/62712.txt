should fix for 3.0
Removing target milestone, no further action for 3.0.
When you put the mouse over a folded part, the background color of the pop-up 
is a bright yellow. If you are using a dark background with light foreground 
colors, you simply can't read the code inside the pop-up. It makes the whole 
folding thing pretty annoying for dark-background users.

Yeah - see #41867 (which is approaching *two* *years* *old* ... impressive for a
crippling accessibility issue ...)
