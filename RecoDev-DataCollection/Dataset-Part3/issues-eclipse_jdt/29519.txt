I have the impression that the Eclipe JUnitRunner stores stack trace 
information of failed tests in a Map, with the keys being the names of the test 
methods. In the attached JUnit test class, I create a suite of tests myself. 
The suite contains several runs of the same test methods, but with other 
arguments. Only the stack trace information of the last failed run is stored. 
Previous failures show the stack trace information of this last failure. In the 
provided example, the different stack traces should show:

Failing with argument 0
Failing with argument 1
Failing with argument 2
Failing with argument 3

But they show:

Failing with argument 3
Failing with argument 3
Failing with argument 3
Failing with argument 3

Example code to reproduce the problem

Add this test class to a project in a Java package named "dummy.junitrunner".
Erich, any comments ?
