I20100713-0800 (old problem)

The condition in SearchUtil.warnIfBinaryConstant(IJavaElement, Shell) is wrong. It tests whether the field is declared in a binary type, but that doesn't matter for this problem. What matters is whether a *reference* is in a binary type (since only those references are not being found due to bug 12044).

I first thought we could improve the test by using
"IField.getConstant() != null", but that Java model method doesn't work reliably since it doesn't resolve the initializer (bug 202293). So we have to keep the warning for all static final fields of a "dangerous" type.
