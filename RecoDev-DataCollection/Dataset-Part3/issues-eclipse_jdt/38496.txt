Disabling the action needs to parse the compilation unit which we decided not 
to do for selection changes. The action should be enabled and a message dialog 
should pop-up in this case. Having a type without members is a rare case 
anyway.

proposed fix.

Throws up a msg dialog if there are less than 2 elements to be sorted.

modified patch: if number of top level types > 1, then sorting is possible even
if there are no members in the types
