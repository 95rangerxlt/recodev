JDTCore v_501

The following code should be fine from a grammar standpoint:

interface I {
    enum Location {
    }
}

we incorrectly reject it as a syntax error.

}

I will investigate.
I miss the enum declaration as part of the InterfaceMemberDeclaration.
Fixed. I will run all tests prior to release.
Fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression test added in Converter15 (test0033)
