'Override method' content assist creates invalid methods for interface methods

interface A {
  int a();
}
interface B extends A {
  // content assist proposal for overriding a() inserts a method body
  // content assist proposal for overriding clone() inserts illegal modifier
  //    'protected' and does not end with ';'
}

*** Bug 89182 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
In my case it is failing in Bindings#getMethodInHeirarchy to match the
parameters of the method.  In the end it is the string compare of the parameter
type names that fails.

Type passed into OverrideCompletionProposal from
ResultCollector#createMethodDeclarationProposal:
Lorg.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionEvent;

Type from the type binding being compared against:
org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionEvent
this is a regression.
Seems to be a result of the changes in OverrideCompletionProposal which used to
(R1.6) check for the type being an interface and configuring the
CodeGenerationSettings accordingly. 
tobias, you converted the proposal to bindings
Tobias, can we do something here for M6 (today) ?
