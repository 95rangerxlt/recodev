In the case of importing many classes from the same package
"organize imports" should be able to make use of the *
notation, e.g. if the number of classes from a package
exceeds 2.

Did you try to set the preferences Number of imports needed for .* in:
Preferences>Java>Organize Imports>Number of imports needed for .*.
By default it is 99. Set it to 2 and it should do what you want.
Ok to close?
Thanks a lot. It's not always obvious to find the relevant options.
