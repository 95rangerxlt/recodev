running Refactor->Rename from the PackageExplorer on a LinkedFile moves the 
file from it's original location into the project folder and changes its type 
to File.  Rename from Navigator View works correctly (hmmn, at least what i'd 
expect - only the link name is renamed.  i guess the expectation would play out 
differently if the project was also the source folder...)

to recreate (in M5):
- create new linked resource (file or directory) in project
- Properties show type as Linked
- Refactor-->Rename from Package Explorer
- Properties show type as NOT Linked
- original resource moved from original location into Project folder
