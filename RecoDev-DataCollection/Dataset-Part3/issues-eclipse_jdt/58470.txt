If you open the 1.5 type java.lang.Collections, the source mapper cannot 
retrieve the positions of the add(E) method. It looks like the binary method in 
the Java model is add(Object).

We should address this in 1.5 stream only. If simple enough, then we may 
consider to backport it to HEAD stream to improve people's experience. But this 
feels very unlikely as it will drag in more support behind it.
Changed SourceMapper.getUnqualifiedMethodHandle(...) to to handle generic 
parameter types.

Added regression tests AttachSourceTests.testGeneric1() and testGeneric2()
