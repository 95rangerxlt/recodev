I can click on a variable in the outline, and get a menu item to create
the getter and setter.  I often want to just create a public getter without
the corresponding public setter.  I would like a "create getter" menu entry as
well.

this would require a dialog and we didn't like a dialog.

I'd suggest to add a dialog and the dialog should show me all the fields of a 
type with the selection in the outliner initially selected. However, this is 
time permitting only.
moving to Adam since he has adopted the getter/setter UI
added a dialog - opens whan you invoke the action on a type or a compilation 
unit
give you the requested functionality (you cen select which methods you want 
created)
