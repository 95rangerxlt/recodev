If annotation processing is enabled on a project, the project is built, and 
then annotation processing is disabled, we don't clean everything up.

Generated files will be left behind until the user does a clean.  (That is, 
simply doing a build will not make them go away, as it would if apt were still 
enabled and the annotations were changed.)

The generated source dir will still be left on the project's build path.  (This 
part should be easy to fix, using a preference listener.)

Actually, now that I think about it, we may not even clean up if the user does 
a clean and APT is disabled for the project.  We should verify this.



Confirmed. Cleaning with APT disabled does not remove generated files.

If we could fix this from teh UI, that would be great.  When someone disables 
APT on a project, we could do a clean before disabling.  This would ensure 
that all of the cruft is cleaned up.  Also, you could remove the generated_src 
dir from the project's source path settings, and delete the directory.  

See GeneratedFileManager#removeFromProjectClasspath(...).
  
Actually, I have some more info: the problem is not that the generated files
aren't deleted (they are). It is that they are regenerated after they are deleted.

Proposed patch to prevent system from re-genning files when APT is off

This adds code that listens to the plugin preferences for changes in the
workspace-level APT configration. Previously only project-level configuration
was being listened to.
Submitted Daniel's patch to CVS.
