javadoc allows tag names including period.
Eclipse correctly shows it in "javadoc view" and hover text.
However syntax highlight does not consider to such tag names.

Can you give the spec of what makes up a tag? I could not find the definition
anywhere? Please reopen when you do.
I don't know specification of tag names. However I can show you that javadoc
allows tag names including period. 

1. create Taglet
ex) copy ToDoTaglet.java to your directory from
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/javadoc/taglet/ToDoTaglet.java


2. compile it 
ex) javac -classpath .;%JAVA_GOME%\lib\tools.jar ToDoTaglet.java

3. create javadoc with it.
ex) javadoc -classpath .;%JAVA_GOME%\lib\tools.jar -taglet ToDoTaglet
ToDoTaglet.java

4. you can read the following message.
----------------
Note: Custom tags that could override future standard tags:  @todo. To avoid pot
ential overrides, use at least one period character (.) in custom tag names.
----------------

this message clearly shows that javadoc allows tag names including period.
Thanks for the info. We should indeed color the entire tag, then.
