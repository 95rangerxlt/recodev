Build I200408170800: Completions of javadoc comments does not consider generic 
types

Steps to reproduce:
- Create class C<T>
- Create method T f(T t)
- Type "/**" above the declaration and hit <Enter>
Could explain what you expect?

For C<T> it currently adds: 
    /**
     * ...
     * @param <T>
     */
 
And for f:
    /**
     * ...
     * @param t
     * @return
     */

Must have been fixed in the mean time...
Verified.
