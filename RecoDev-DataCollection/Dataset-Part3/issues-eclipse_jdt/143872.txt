N20060525-0010

The schema for org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core's annotationProcessorFactory extension point is incomplete (and maybe even wrong):

* 'factory > class' attribute should have:
- Type: 'java' (not 'string') and
- Extends: 'com.sun.mirror.apt.AnnotationProcessorFactory'

Without these meta attributes, PDE cannot properly support contributors:
- 'Rename Type' refactorings and Java search don't find/update references in plugin.xml
- no validation of contributed processor factory classes
- no help for creating new processor factories

* 'factory > class' is optional -> shouldn't it be required?
* 'factory > implements' does not seem to be used for anything -> remove?
* boilerplate "[Enter description of ..." and empty documentation in a few places

Walter, can you put together a patch for this?


Created attachment 43038
Fix to extension point schema

Here's a patch for annotationProcessorFactory.  I notice that the same comments apply to o.e.jdt.core.compilationParticipant.exsd; I will open a separate bug for that.

Updated patch to extension schema

Actually, the 'class' attribute should implement, not extend, AnnotationProcessorFactory.
Patch looks good.

I guess you mean bug 143874? (Sorry, I should have added a link here...)
AFAICS, this only affects the presentation in the UI, not the .exsd document.
Targeting 3.2.1 for this.
Fixed in HEAD, needs to be merged to 3.2.1.

Note that since we didn't get this done in time for 3.2, I've left the "implements" attribute in place, but deprecated it.  That is different than the attached patches, which removed the attribute altogether.
Merged into 3.2.1 as of v20060712-1830
