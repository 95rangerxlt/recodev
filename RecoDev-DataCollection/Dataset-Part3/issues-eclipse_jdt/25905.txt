Build 20021105.

IMenuCreator.getMenu(Control), IMenuCreator.getMenu(Menu) are called everytime 
a the drop down for a menu/tool item is executed.  HistoryDropDownAction 
creates a new menu each time getMenu() is called, but the menu is never 
disposed of.  The actions should cache the menu when it is created and dispose 
of the menu when getMenu() is called (this assumes the menu must be recreated 
each time the drop down occurs).  

The dispose() method should also dispose of the created menu.  This method will 
be called when the parent widget is disposed.  Currently this is not the case 
(see UI bug report [Bug 25837] IMenuCreator.dispose() is never called), but 
this will be fixed.  Even so, this fix will not solve the above mentioned leak.
