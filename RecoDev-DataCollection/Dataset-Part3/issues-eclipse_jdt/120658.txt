Invoke content assist where indicated. Although I choose run(), a stub for finalize() is inserted.

public enum Try {
    THIS,
    THAT(),
    ANONYMOUS() {}
    
    {
        new Runnable() {
            //content assist, choose run(), inserts finalize()
        }
    }
}

I verified that the correct method (run) gets selected but the replacement string is badly computed in OverrideCompletionProposal.updateReplacementString(...).
Tobias, that's "your" code. Can you look into that, thanks.
