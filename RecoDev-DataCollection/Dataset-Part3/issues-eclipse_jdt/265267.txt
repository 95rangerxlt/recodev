Eclipse 3.5M5

If the block selection spans more than one folded region, any edit (cut, delete, insert) will have unexpected results. E.g.

class Sample {
  private void foo() {
  }
  private void bar() {
  }
}

1. Collapse both methods
2. Block-select the 'private' keywords
3. Press Delete
-> The code is screwed up:

class Sample {
    void bar() {
    
}
