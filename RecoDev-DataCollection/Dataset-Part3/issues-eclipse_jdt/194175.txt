- search for references to a Java class
=> search result has filter "In Imports" enabled by default

- disable filter "In Imports"
- search for references to another class
=> search result has filter "In Imports" enabled
=> expected: changed filter settings should apply to all Java searches (old and new ones)

The filter settings are per search result. Changing a setting only changes it for the current result. A new search takes the last configured settings.
I tried this and this seems to work.
I can't reproduce the given steps (except for the last comment, but there I don't agree).
Seems to depend on the workspace. Worked for me in my development workspace, but did not work in a fresh N20070705-0010 workspace.

- open ZipFile
- Ctrl+Shift+G
- disable "In Imports"
- click into ZipConstants of the implements clause
- Ctrl+Shift+G
=> "In Imports" enabled
The bug is that when you disabled all filters, the next search has the default filters (In Imports) enabled again. Fixed in JavaMatchFilter.
