Steps:

1)create a class as such:

public class Test {	
	private class Test2 {
		public Test2(){
		}
	}
}

2)copy this class from one package to another.
3)Notice that in the members view the inner member Test2 is visible. 

This is inconsistant as normally I don't see inner members in the members view 
and Test2 will disapear when the view is refreshed.

The bug is wrong. Members view always shows inner types. I assume you meant the
Types view: if I do the following:

1. select and copy class Test in Types view
2. select another package in the Packages view
3. from the package's context menu select 'Paste'
==> the inner class is shown in the types view which is wrong

Changed Summary and fixed the described scenario.

Please file a new bug with test case if you think there's a problem with the
Members view.
