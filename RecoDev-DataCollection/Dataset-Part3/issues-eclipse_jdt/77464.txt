The default for 'Use space for tab' is false while the formatter's default
profile 'Java conventions' uses spaces, i.e., 'Use tab character' is false. This
is not consistent.

This will get worse (mixed indents) once bug 63621 has been fixed.
Also note that we would have to change other settings (e.g. set displayed tab
width to 8 as requested by several closed PRs) in order to be in sync with the
Java code conventions.

fixed as bug 19036 has been fixed - there is no duplicated preference any longer.
