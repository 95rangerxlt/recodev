Martin let's discuss how to improve the wording.

From Greg:

* With respect to the preference page its problematic on several fronts
- it requires me to have to rebuild everything
- it is separate from the task view & thus does not work as your typical view 
filter works

*  the page itself is unclear to a user. When a user first sees this preference 
page they are not sure what it actually means. This is probably fixed with some 
simple text that says something like "What severity level do you want to assign 
to the following problems."

added a description to the tab folder:

'Select the severity level for the following problems:'

Any actions for the first point? Moving to EG.
