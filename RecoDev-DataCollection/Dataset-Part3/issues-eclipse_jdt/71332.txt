OS : RHEL 3.0 
Build date: 0730 
Language: CHS 

Problem Description: Create a Java project, click File > New > Others, Select 
Junit Test Case under JUnit 
Click Next, there are strings in English: "text ui", "swing ui", "awt ui".


Can someone make sure these are externalized for the next release?  Thanks.
