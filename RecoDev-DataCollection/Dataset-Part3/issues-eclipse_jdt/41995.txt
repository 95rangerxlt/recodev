I have a class named "su" -- yes its lowercase and doesn't follow the standards,
but thats how it is.

Using the Open Type command, when I type in "su" to the Choose a type text
field, I have to scroll past all of the classes that begin with a capital S
before I see my class. 

It feels like this should sort the classes case insensitively. "Open Resource"
does this behavior correctly. So they should behave the same.

I'm wondering if it would be better if Open Type *was* case sensitive and showed
you results based on what case you typed in first...
This got addressed with the new open type dialog which doesn't sort lower case
classes to the end anymore.
