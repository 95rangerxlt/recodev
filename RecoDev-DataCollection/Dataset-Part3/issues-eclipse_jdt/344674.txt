See steps to reproduce.  This means this refactoring on save must be disabled otherwise bugs to our code can easily sneak in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Save this code (part of a compareTo method):
        for (int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            // A comment
            int v = Utils.compare(tokens[i], ((MyClass) obj).tokens[i]);
            if (v!=0) return v;
        }

After saving, convert on save produces this:
        for (String token : tokens) {
            // Comment
            int v = Utils.compare(token, token);
            if (v!=0) return v;
        }

Apologies if this isn't a JDI UI area - I chose this because that's where the per-project preferences are saved.
Deepak, can you please have a look? We should disable the clean up / quick assist when the reference has a qualifier (except for "this." for a field).

I disabled the quick assist when the qualifiers are different in the loop condition and in the loop body.

Fixed in HEAD. Commit - 25d38709407efcb36807e640bb076258ccdf5ecc

With Git, that should be "Fixed in master".


Reopening, since there's still a case where the quick assist replaces too much (this.tokens[i] should not be replaced):

package test;

public class EnhancedForLoopTest implements Comparable<EnhancedForLoopTest> {
	String tokens[];

	@Override
	public int compareTo(EnhancedForLoopTest obj) {
		for (int i = 0; i < obj.tokens.length; i++) {
			// A comment
			int v = String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER.compare(this.tokens[i], obj.tokens[i]);
			if (v != 0)
				return v;
		}
		return 0;
	}
}


Furthermore, the quick assist should actually not be disabled for comment 0. It should just not replace "((MyClass) obj).tokens[i]", because that expression is not an access to the loop array.

You mean the result of the conversion for comment 0 should be the following ? (What is 'i' here ?)

        for (String token : tokens) {
            // Comment
            int v = Utils.compare(token, ((MyClass) obj).tokens[i]));
            if (v!=0) return v;
        }

Good catch! I have disabled the quick assist for this case too.

D'oh, you're right, that doesn't make sense.

But as a last thing, you should use JdtASTMatcher (which also compares bindings) and not ASTMatcher. Counter-example:

package test;
public class A {
	String[] things;
	
	A other;
	
	private A get(A a) {
		return a;
	}
	
    public void foo(A arg) {
        for (int i = 0; i < get(other).things.length; i++) {
        	A other= this; // local var shadows field
            System.out.println(get(other).things[i]);
        }
    }
}
