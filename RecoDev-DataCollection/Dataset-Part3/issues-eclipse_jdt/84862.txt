Is it possible to change ASTProvider.ActivationListener.isJavaEditor() method
to be more open for subclasses of CompilationUnitEditor? I know, that it is not
API, but SWT Designer and VE use it and, becase their have ID different than two
hardcoded in isJavaEditor(), advanced syntax is not highlighted after changes.
  May be some solution using "instanceof" or "getAdapter()"?

Fixed. It now returns:
JavaUI.ID_CF_EDITOR.equals(id) || JavaUI.ID_CU_EDITOR.equals(id) ||
ref.getPart(false) instanceof JavaEditor;
