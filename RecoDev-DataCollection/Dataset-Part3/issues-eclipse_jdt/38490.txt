In the following line type ";" at the cursor location
   System.ou<CURSOR>t.println("dfasdfsdf") /* */

the semicolon is inserted at the end of the line
   System.ou<CURSOR>t.println("dfasdfsdf") /* */<;>

I would have expected it appears before the "end of line comment"

Hm, this isn't really an "end of line comment"...

But we should do the right thing if there is nothing but white space in the 
default (java) partition at EOL. Have to make sure it moves to the very end in 
the following scenario:

obj.m<CURSOR>ethod(param1, null /* no setting */, bla)<;>
fixed a long time ago
