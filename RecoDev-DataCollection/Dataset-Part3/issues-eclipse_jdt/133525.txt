M6 test path

1. Synchronize with 'CVS with model'
2. Each incoming/outgoing cu in the tree has a [+] icon
3. Clicking on the [+] icon just makes the icon go away
->If it is not possible to expand the cu (and see changes on children of a cu) then the plus icon should not be shown at all.

Patch to JDT/UI
Here's another patch to the Java synchronize content provider. There are actually three problems being fixed:

1) The + on the CU and files in java projects
2) An error in the viewer update logic that left empty projects around
3) A error that occurs accessing projects that are closed
Thanks for the patch!
