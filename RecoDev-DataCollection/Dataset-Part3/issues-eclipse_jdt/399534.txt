BETA_JAVA8:

The following program should report an error, but presently doesn't:

// ---
interface I { void run(int x); }

class X {
	void foo() {
	    I r = (String y) -> {};
        }
}

Hint: Synthesize a method binding for the anonymous method, tag it as
anonymous and use MethodVerifier.doesMethodOverride

Jesper, since you already have some code in place for this and you have the
citation ready chapter and verse, this is yours :)
Most of the fix was already in place (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382701#c47).

Added tests and some tweaks and released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=e78b831ecdf23a867bd21d96aa870a039cfa4f4c
