I am assuming this at least partly an SWT bug, although I have only seen it
in JDT.  My apologies if it is JDT-specific.

Popup text boxes (namely Javadoc popups, seen when pressing F2 when a type or 
method is highlighted in a Java editor) are text wrapped incorrectly.  The 
rightmost text is hidden by the vertical scrollbar.  The vertical scrollbar 
should not cover any text and there should be no horizontal scrollbar if text 
is being wrapped.

To reproduce, open a Java file that uses String, highlight an occurrance 
of "String", and press F2.

This is build 20020610 on Win2K.

Looks like the text is being wrapped against the bounds instead of the client 
area.

we will accept this limitation for 2.0
Reopening for 2.1 consideration

1) The StyledText widget in DefaultInformationControl is not being created 
with the style SWT.WRAP.  Therefore, the wrapping is not being done by 
StyledText.  If you turn wrapping on, no horizontal scrollbar is required, 
however, some other code is doing the wrapping by inserting new lines and the 
appearance looks bad.  The new lines are being inserted by 
JavaInformationProvider.

2) The amount the text wrapping is off by is the width of the vertical 
scrollbar.  Probably the width passed into 
JavaInformationProvider.getInformation(ITextViewer, IRegion) is incorrect - 
assumes no vertical scrollbar.

I think that JavaInformationProvider should stop trying to wrap the text 
itself and leave that up to StyledText.  In the past, it may have been 
neccessary for the JavaInformationProvider to wrap the text because wrapping 
was not supported by StyledText but that is no longer the case.
Fixed in HEAD by using the Browser widget.
Note that the Browser widget is not always available (e.g. on Linux, embedded mozilla may not be installed).  You need to be sure you fail gracefully in this case.
Thanks - we know that ;-) but don't plan to do any further work / bug fixing on the fallback solution.
