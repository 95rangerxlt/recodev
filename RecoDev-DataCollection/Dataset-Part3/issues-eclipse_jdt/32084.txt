in M5, the "Projects" window of the java browsing perspective the Project -> 
Open Project menu item wont activate.  If I close all projects, I cant open 
them up again.  

I have to go to the resource perspective or the java perspective to open 
projects.

This got addressed for build > I20030216. The problem is that the projects view 
only shows Java projects and a closed project doesn't have any state hence 
doesn't know if it is a Java project. 

If you open the context menu with no projet selected there is now an Open 
Project action which opens a dialog with closed projects.
