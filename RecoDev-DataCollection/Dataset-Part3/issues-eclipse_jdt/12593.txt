package p;
import java.util.List;

public abstract class Test {
  
    public void foo() {
    	List l= new List(){<CODE ASSIST HERE>}
    }
}

choose the 'addAll' method (any of the two)
you get the fully qualified name for Collections 
(although my java editor/code assist preference says it should insert an import 
statement)
