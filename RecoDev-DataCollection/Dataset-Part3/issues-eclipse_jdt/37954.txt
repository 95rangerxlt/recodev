I have to Java projects, which I wanted to merge into one Java project. Both 
have the same source folder for Java source (project/src).

- Right click on the Java source folder of the source project and select copy.
- Right click on the target project and select paste

The is a warning displayed "Target already has a folder 'src'. Overwrite?" and 
the option Yes/No/Cancel.

When clicking Yes, a progress monitor is displayed that shows "deleting 'src'"

The displayed warning doesn't they anything about that a target folder will be 
cleared before copying the new folder. This is NOT EXPECTED and WRONG BEHAVIOR.

When copying a folder in the Windows Explorer and the target folder already 
exists, than Windows Explorer doesn't delete the target before copying. It 
simply adds the new files to the target folder. This is default behavior on 
every OS and on every File Manager.

I expect Eclipse to behave the same way and not to delete the target folder 
before copying!!!

Sorry, there is a type. Should start with "I have two Java..."
Adam, this is a dup of the PR we moved to Platform core. Can you please find 
the dup. We should make sure when rewriting reorg core has a fix for this.
bug 29838 [resources] API: allow #move to merge with existing destination
bug 31883 [resources] API: allow #copy to merge with existing destination

we should mark this as either a dup of or dependent on these bugs
Gunnar, please do not assign priority to bug reports - only committers are 
supposed to do so
waiting for core support
Reopening...
Please comment if there is anything left to do.
when the core features are implemented, this should be looked at again and 
tested
back to inbox - i can't do anything before the platforms features are available
Platform/Core decided not to fix 31883 for 3.0 so there is little we can do 
here. However, we should improve the error message.
Wow, does that mean, that the usual system behavior people have been using for 
a plenty of years, will still not be the same in Eclipse after the 3rd major 
release?
Unfortunatelly yes. Given that this function isn't used very much we gave 
other features a higher priority (for example deadlocks when running things in 
background)
Added a skip dialog which avoids deleting a folder with the same name in the 
destination if the folder isn-t empty. 

There is any else JDT/UI can do for 3.0. Marking bug as remind so that we can 
fix it as soon as 31883 is fixed.

As it seem this story is alive since much longer than foreseen when looking at Bug 96587, i repeat here the update i entered for that bug.

This problem is really a pain in the neck, i'm restructuring a group of
projetcs and due to this i have to open windows explorer, copy/paste in it then
refresh projects to see changes.
Pls include it at least in 3.2, this beahviour is really user unfriendly.

Thanks.

As of now 'LATER' and 'REMIND' resolutions are no longer supported.
Please reopen this bug if it is still valid for you.
Still an issue in 3.6.
The original bug (overwrite / data loss) has been fixed in 3.0 i.e. the target is not overwritten anymore. What's left is to implement 'merge' behavior as done in the Navigator. I've opened bug 308297 to track this.
