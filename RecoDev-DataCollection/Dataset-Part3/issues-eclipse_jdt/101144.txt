org.eclipse.jdt.apt.tests.jdtcoretests.AllJdtCoreTests should go away and we 
should start using org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.RunJDTCoreTests.  

Right now, there's a bug where we need to run the model tests first when the 
APT plugin is loaded, or the tests fail.

should be fixed.  I left the AllJdtCoreTests class in CVS in the event that 
someone needs to change the ordering of the jdt core tests around in the 
future.  I thought this was a convenient place to do it. 


fixed now.
