Pressing enter after an opening curly brace closes the curly brace repeatedly.
IF you are about to define a method and you open a curly brace, the completion 
closing curly brace is added automatically. 

If you go and press "enter" again in front of the opening curly brace , it adds 
another closing brace repeatedly.

Pressing enter repeatedly in front of the opening curly brace keeps adding a
closing curly brace again and again
Works for me using I20040130.

I was using an earlier version I200401290841
I doubt that this got fixed just during that one day. Can you provide a
step-by-step test case where you see this?

1. Declare a method  eg: private void foo() {}
2. Add extra bracket  private void foo() { } }
3. Press enter after the opening curly bracket
private void foo() {
 } }
4. Every enter now pressed adds a closing bracket. Which is Incorrect.


step 4: press enter after private void foo() {

fixed - we should only close the brace if the brace balance is positive, i.e.
there are more opening than closing braces with respect to the caret position.
We used to close the brace whenever the braces are unbalanced.

will commit after M7 is out.
