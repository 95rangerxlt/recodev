The Java preference pages don't look very good when the user makes the 
preference page dialog narrower or shorter by manually resizing it.

Here is a breakdown of problems by page:

Builder:
"Filtered resources" text field should shrink to fit the dialog width more.

Classpath Variables:
List box should shrink to fit and should scroll if necessary.

Code Formatter:
Text box should shrink to fit and should scroll if necessary (the scroll bars 
are there, why aren't they used?).

Step Filtering:
List box should shrink horizontally to fit and should scroll if necessary 
(compare vertical and horizontal behaviour when shrinking the preference page 
dialog).

Editor:
In the Syntax tab page, the "Preview" text box should shrink to fit and scroll 
if necessary.

Installed JREs:
The table viewer should shrink to fit and scroll if necessary.

Javadoc:
The "Javadoc command" text field should shrink to fit more.

Organize Imports:
The list box should shrink to fit and scroll if necessary.

Templates:
The table viewer should shrink to fit and scroll if necessary.

should fix
The reason is the widthHint set on these controls that prevent the dialog 
becoming huge when containing long labels.

As far as I know there is no other solution that would fix both problems. Erich?
idea is to reduce the width hint where possible. we should do one pass.
Adam could you do this with Martin.
Builder: - fixed
Javadoc: - fixed
Organize Imports: - fixed
Templates: - fixed
Code Formatter: - fixed

Classpath Variables: - need Martin's help

Editor: - fixed to some extent 
rest must be fixed in WorkbenchChainedTextFontFieldEditor 
which grabs way too much space

Installed JREs: - debug
Step Filtering: - debug 

-------
pong to Martin - please see if i did not do anything heretic
Classpath Variables i didn't know how to fix

we should move it to debug then

for 2.0 it's done
we should have another look before 2.1
