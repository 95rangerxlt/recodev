In Eclipse 3.1.1, with "Mark Occurrences" enabled, clicking on a variable or method in the outline view caused all occurences to be marked in the editor. This was also the case in Eclipse 3.0. 

In Eclipse 3.2M5 and 3.2M6, clicking on a variable or method in the outline view does not mark all occurrences. 

Is this intentional? I rely heavily on the pre-3.2 behaviour when browsing unfamiliar or complex source code.

Not fixed for me in N20060409-0010. Will try again in a few days' time.
Alan, just in case you missed the Math classes: '>' means "greater than" ;-)
Having taken the math class I missed, this now works for me. Thanks.
