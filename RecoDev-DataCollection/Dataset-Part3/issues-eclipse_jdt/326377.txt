Given:
public class E02 {

	public static abstract class Bar {
		public abstract void doBar();
	}

	public void foo() {
		addBar(new Bar|)
	}

	public void addBar(Bar bar) {

	}

}
1. Cursor where the '|' is
2. Control space
3. Select E02.Bar proposal
IS:
		addBar(new Bar() {
			
			@Override
			public void doBar() {
			}
		};)
Should:
		addBar(new Bar() {
			
			@Override
			public void doBar() {
			}
		});

I think this might be a regression: I've never had that before.

Yep, that's right.
