Processors can enable type generation during reconcile by returning the string AptPreferenceConstants.RTTG_ENABLED_OPTION from their supportedOptions() implementation.

The Sun javadoc for supportedOptions() says that options should be prefaced by -A, although bugs in the Sun implementation have created some confusion around the presence or absence of the -A.

To avoid any confusion, we should interpret the string with or without the -A option.  That is, "-AenableTypeGenerationInEditor" and "enableTypeGenerationInEditor" should mean the same thing.

This is a safe, simple, and non-breaking change that does not affect API.

Proposed patch

Proposed patch enables reconcile-time type generation if a processor's supported options includes either of "enableTypeGenerationInEditor" or "-AenableTypeGenerationInEditor".
Jess and Tim, please review
Fixed for 3.3RC2.
