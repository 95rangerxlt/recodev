In builds I20021203 and N20021204 a strange effect occurs when copying and 
pasting source code in the Java Browsing view.  When you try and copy source 
from a read only (attached source) class view (e.g. JList) into your own 
source view (not read only - and not attached source) the cut command is 
ignored.

This didn't use to happen with M3.

(This is easily monitored if you watch cut and paste activity in the MS Office 
Clipboard - copying from your own code appears in the clipboard, but copying 
from read only attached source doesn't.  Switching off the clipboard doesn't 
help, so it isn't the clipboard causing the problem)

do you mean copy from the editor or copy from a view?
I'm in the Java Browsing view, with the editor as standard at the bottom.  
It's now worse, as my files are under source control and any that are 
currently read only are also unable to be 'copied' from!  As soon as I check 
the file out and it becomes writable then copy works fine...
the question is if you selected something in the editor or in one of the 4 
views at the top (i mean before you pressed 'copy')? 
that will help me assign the report to the correct person
In the editor - sorry for the confusion!
no probs - thx
Several actions weren't enabled on read only files. This has been fixed for 
build 20021210.
