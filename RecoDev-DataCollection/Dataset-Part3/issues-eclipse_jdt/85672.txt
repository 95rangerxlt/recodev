I20050215-2300 (m5 test pass)

Have this code: 
"package folding;

class Test {
    
}"  <-- no delimiter on last line

Put the caret right after the closing brace and fold the region. Note that there
is a phantom line in the editor since we cannot fold that one away. Put the
caret on the last line and unfold the type. 

expected: caret is right after the closing brace
actual: everything from after the *opening* brace is selected

Not a regression - it is like this in 3.0

ProjectionViewer.widgetSelectionToModelSelection does a better job now
transforming the selection. In addition to the image ranges received from the
information mapping, we add some UI-side smartness to give consistent and
expected selection transformations.
