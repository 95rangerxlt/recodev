public class Pqr {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new Stu(5);
	}
}

public class Stu {
	public Stu(int x) {
		x++;
	}
}

1. Create the two class sources above.
2. Rename Stu -> St in-place: Completes silently.
3. Roll back to the situation in (1).
4. Rename Stu -> Vwx in-place: Preview dialogue appears.

In the dialogue-based rename both new names allow you to finish without forcing a preview.

Works for me in I20070524-0010.

Reopening. Found a scenario to reproduce the forced preview when no textual updates are to be applied:
- start inline rename
- select a word with Ctrl+Arrow_Left or Ctrl+Arrow_Right
- change the name
- Enter
Fixed in RenameLinkedMode.
