known problem. Giving up trying to come up with two different names. We want 
the short "Packages" title in both the classic Packages View and the Java 
Browsing Packages view. However, we need to have different titles in the Show 
View menu.

Here is how to do this:
- in the XML the Packages view of the Java Browsing perspective is 
called "Project Packages". Since it shows the packages of a project only.
- in the code the Java Browsing Packages View overrides getTitle and
  returns the short "Packages"

Fixed - also changed the Project's view label to Java Projects in the XML. In 
the code it is still "Projects"
