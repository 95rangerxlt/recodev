How much sense does it make to generate a native setter/getter ?
we should remove the native getter/setter option (same like abstract which we
don't offer)

proposed fix. removes native option for getter/setter action.

We could have a special case and just not create the body for native
getter/setter creation; however this seems so specialized, that I agree that
removing the option is probably best.
