Table is missing a height hint. Since it isn't extensible it should have a 
height hint of 4.

Martin - pls veto if you disagree
it has it set to 5 characters

what you _really_ want is to set it to 
  headerHeight + 4 * (tableItemHeight + lineHeight)

but because it uses DialogFields and not normal swt controls there's no clean 
way to do it (there might be but i don't know the dialog fields area well 
enough)

i changed 5 to 7, which works better but like i said above, in general it is 
incorrect
