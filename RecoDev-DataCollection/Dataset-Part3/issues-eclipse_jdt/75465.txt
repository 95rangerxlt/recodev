not a dup
*** Bug 81154 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
example: hover on the second 'T' in:

  <T extends Number & Comparable> void method(List<T> list) {}

Expected:
- the source hover should show "T extends Number & Comparable"

Bug 81154 is not a dup - I believe it talks about the header of the javadoc hover.
