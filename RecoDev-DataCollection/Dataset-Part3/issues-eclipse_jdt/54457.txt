20040311

Selfhosting workspace with extra plugin org.eclipse.jdt.rewrite (from SNZ rep)

Rename NewASTRewrite.createCopyPlaceholder

Afor all references an error is created: 'Another name shadows access to the
renamed element'

Thsi makes no sense here: There is only one createCopyPlaceholder in the class
and also the new name is not used.

What could be the problem is that I have two projects with class NewASTRewrite.
The two projects are unrelated, however.

We should try to fix this for 3.0.
It's not a problem with your setup.
Can reproduce in I20040318 (with method createCopyTarget()).
I20040406, workspace with
- jdt.ui, jdt.core and text from head
- core.runtime.* and all the rest imported as binary

Same thing when trying to rename
Refactoring#checkInitialConditions(IProgressMonitor):
-> many wrong errors in tests + one in RenameTempAction.java
Fixed in HEAD. Fix for bug 57749 fixed the messages.
Additional heuristic avoids expensive search when shadowing cannot happen since
there's no possibly clashing method declaration.
