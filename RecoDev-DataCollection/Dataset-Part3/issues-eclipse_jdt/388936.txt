JDT/Core tests use their own minimal versions of java classpath libraries.

We need to create versions of these for 1.8 compliance,
AFAICS this involves creating the following files:
- jclMin1.8src.zip
- jclMin1.8.jar
- converterJclMin1.8src.zip
- converterJclMin1.8.jar

Here are the steps I used:

    - Copy the 1.7 versions of the source zips into a scratch area,
    - Unzip them, edit them to include annotation target element types
TYPE_USE and TYPE_PARAMETER,
    - Rezip them under the new name.
    - Import these zips into a clean project in a fresh workspace, build
    - jar up the classes into the binaries jar
    - Populate all new files zips and hars in the JDT/Core workspace, refresh
    - Modify the setup files to use them at 1.8

At this point, the magic number still says these are 1.7 classes, but don't
think that matters.

All tests are green.
