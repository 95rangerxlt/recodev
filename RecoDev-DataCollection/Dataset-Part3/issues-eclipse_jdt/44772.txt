1. Navigate > Open type...
2. Enter 'Document'
3. In the list of available choice, click on the interface 'Document'.  There 
are three potential qualifiers: 
    i. javax.swing.text.
    ii. org.w3c.dom (from the xerces plug-in that I have in my workspace).
    iii. org.w3c.dom (from rt.jar of my Sun's 1.4.2 JRE)
4. Choose iii.  Click OK.
You will see that the interface that I chose did not open.  Instead the one 
from ii did.
