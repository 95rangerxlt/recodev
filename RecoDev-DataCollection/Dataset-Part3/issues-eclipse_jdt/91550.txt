Build 3.1m6

Identifying quickly all return statements using mark occurrences would be nice.
What would be the usecase/benefit for this?

Mark occurrences travereses the AST. What's the easiest way to get all identical
keywords?

In case there are several return points in a method, it would be useful to
quickly be able to visualize them. 

Return statements are what you need to look for.
Oh well, that's already there and even better: it finds all method exit points:
simply click on the return type (or void).

I don't think that simple keyword occurrence marking is of real value.
I agree. Though for highlighting return point, you should allow selecting any
return statement as well.
