The Java UI plugin eagerly activates the Search plugin.

There are 2 reason:
1) ISearchPageScore adapter that is registered
2) fSearchResultViewEntryAdapterFactory

we should investigate whether we can reduce this plugin activation.

The first item can only be fixed by throwing away the functionality to detect
the correct search page. I don't recommend to do so.

I can only find the second item/reference inside Search plug-in. This code does
not get executed until Search plug-in has already been forced to load. Please
add more context.


*** Bug 27362 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Changed summary.
Activating the Java Plugin activates the Search plug-in (it's not only the
switch to Java perspective scenario).

In the duplicate report it's reported that there are no resources yet. Even
though we could wait with registering some adapters until there is at least one
resource I don't think this would be a good idea.

Fixed by
- defering the creation of the JavaSearchPageComputer until the Search plug-in
is activated
- moving instanceof checks to SearchUtil and first test if Search plug-in is
activated

NOTE:
1) This solution is only valid because Search doesn't use the adapters until the
Search plug-in is actually activated.
2)
