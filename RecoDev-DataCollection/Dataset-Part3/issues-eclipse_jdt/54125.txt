Having an error in a line of code (ex: class doesn't exist) eclipse underlines
it with a red line. But when the error is corrected the red line is still there
and when putting the mouse over it, it shows the error message as the error
wasn't corrected. Everything goes ok when file is saved...
I guess a proper behaviour would be to update the errors when the cursor leaves
the word/block of code in question.
I'm using eclipse build 200402260800

Old error message of a fixed error

The code in question had an error, since class Message doesn't exist. When
changing it to ProtoOrderMessage the error isn't removed.
As stated in the bug report, as soon as the file is saved it is ok...
fixed for I20040309
