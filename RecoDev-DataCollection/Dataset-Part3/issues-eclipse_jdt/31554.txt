With the following code in the editor:

try{
  someMethod(); //throws SomeException
}catch(SomeException e){
  someOtherMethod(); //throws SomeException
}

You will get a QuickFix that suggests to add a catch clause to the surrounding 
try. There is no surrounding try. It will add another catch(SomeException e) 
to the try clause above! This catch clause is unreachable (which the editor 
notices). The exception is still uncaught (which the editor doesn't notice).

Time permitted for 2.1.
Martin take care for 2.1
Another related bug - here the quickfix tries to add the catch to the wrong 
catch block (outside of the inner Thread)

public class ConnectionHandler
{
	InputStream m_in;
	OutputStream m_out;
	
	ConnectionHandler(String name,Socket socket)
	{
		try
		{
			m_in = socket.getInputStream();
			m_out = socket.getOutputStream();
			new Thread("Connection handler for " + name)
			{
				public void run()
				{
					DataInputStream din = new 
DataInputStream(m_in);
					String requestType = din.readUTF(); 
				}
			}.start();
		}
		catch (IOException e)
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}

Thanks for the examples!
