What the action actually does is RECREATE the test suite based on the selection
in the dialog.

I do an update on a test suite which contains X. It is no clear that if I only
select Y in the dialog that I'll end up with X being removed. Normally "Update"
shows the content of the existing stuff (dir, zip) and allows to modify this.

I think renaming the action (and the dialog) to Recreate Test Suite would solve
the problem.

Fixed: Now called Recreate Test Suite.
