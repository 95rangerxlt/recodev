Organize imports falsely sums up the total of added and removed imports to 
display a difference.

0 import(s) added. 

means that the total of added and removed imports is 0. It would be better if 
it told the user something like:

1 import(s) removed, 1 import(s) added.


The status message is slightly more useful than you might think at first 
glance, as in the odd case that it does not work (which I can't reproduce) you 
want to notice this, and a useful status message helps.

I agree, will improve that

Patch

Martin, please have a look at this patch and tell me whether it is fine or not.
nice trick! You would get problems with semicolons in comments, tough.

Patch (bypassing comments)

Martin, what do you think about this one? I tried various scenarios and it
seems as it would work now. Any comments?

This patch should be fine.

Test Cases

Martin, as I have no experience with writing JUnit test cases, it would
probably be a good idea to have a look at them and tell me what should be
changed.
Test cases are good! The only think I would improve are the names of the tests 
as the names are the only thing that show up in the test-reports.

E.g testImportCount1() could be named testImportCountAddNew()
testImportCount1() could be named testImportCountAddNewAndRemove()
or addWithStatic()

Test Cases #2

I tried to give better names - but now they are quite long. I don't know if you
like it that way, Martin.
