Details list made into a table

The details list has been changed into a TableViewer with the same icon as the
OccurrencesInFileLabelProvider uses for non-variable access.
Jesper, can you try to re-create this patch on the latest?
the patch tool will not let me merge now 
(i thought it'd be easier than it is)

thanks

Second attempt

Ok, let's try again...

Maybe the problem is that I forgot to write that the patch was against the
ui.callhierarchy package.

This time it's against the JDT UI project.
perfect
