JDT UI HEAD as of now

There's a new context menu entry in the Java editor's 'Source' menu:
  Configure Deprecation Fix...

The action really seems to only configure things. I tried it several times on the same and other elements and it did not seem to do anything and the value in the dialog seemed not to be persisted/changed. Where can I see what the configuration change did? This configuration should be done where the real action is performed.

Additional problems with this menu entry:
- the menu entry is always there even if it is not applicable. In contrast to
  the main menus the context menu should be up to date and not contain elements
  that show me a dialog which tells me that the action can't be executed.

- it is the only entry between two separators which looks ugly and makes the
  menu longer. I suggest to put it into the same section as 'Clean Up' and
  NLS menu entries.

Unless there's really good reason for it to be in the editor context menu I plan to remove it from the Java editor context menu. Same should probably be done for view context menu.

The action is enabled on deprecated method and fields only. It configures the fix deprecation script stored in the .deprecations folder of a Java project.

This works for me using HEAD. The action is only displayed if the selection contains a single field or method which is deprecated.

Agreed and fixed

Martin, any thoughts?


I think should remove it in the editor and only keep in in the views.
