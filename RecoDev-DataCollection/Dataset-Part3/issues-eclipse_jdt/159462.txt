Using package explorer mode where top level nodes are working sets:
1. expand a working set
2. select a child project, copy it through action menu
3. select again working set node
4. paste project using action menu
--->Observe that the copied project got duplicated (no rename?!)
5. flip back to mode where toplevel nodes are projects:
--->Observe that no copy actually took place !?

This bug only shows up with projects from working sets that are modified externally (e.g. the releng tooling):
A Java working set containing an IProject instead of IJavaProject
