For the following, no F1 help page is present:
1. Clean Up options to convert anonymous class to lambda and back.
2. New Formatter options for lambda.
3. Search - Match location selection for '::' methods references.

Updated the new search option (3. Search - Match location selection for '::' methods references):

I could not find any existing documentation for the multiple clean-up and formatter options. They just have an initial general F1 help page.
