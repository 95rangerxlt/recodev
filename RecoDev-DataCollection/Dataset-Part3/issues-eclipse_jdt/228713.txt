Build ID: I20080421

Steps To Reproduce:

If a plugin or jar file on the factory path is known to contain processors but it does not show any contents in the Advanced Factory Path dialog, it may be missing
the META-INF/services entry or plugin.xml entry that is required to declare the processors.


should "Advanced Factory Path" be "Advanced Factory Path Options"?

thanks

More information:
A little bit more context would help in the future (at least tell us which file).

Possibly affected files:
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference - ref-apt-factoryPath.htm (2 matches)
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference - ref-apt-factoryPathOptions.htm (3 matches)
org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user - contexts_APT.xml

I apologize for that.  Here is the file where the string is located:

eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user\reference\ref-apt-factoryPath.htm
Thanks, John.  Yes, it should be "Advanced Factory Path Options".  I'll fix that.
Fixed for 3.4M7
