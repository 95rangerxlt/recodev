I have changed the "Exception variable name in catch blocks"
to "ex" in the global preferences, under 
  Window->Preferences->Java->CodeStyle.

But this does not seam to function when I use code assist
to create try-catch blocks. I tried out two scenarios:

1. Begin typing "tr" and then use code assist to expand it
   to a try-catch block.

2. Write a statement which is able to throw an Exception
   (eg. "throw new Exception()"), and wait for the report
   of an error ("uncaught exception Exception").
   I then use code assist to wrap this statement with
   a try-catch block.

In both cases, neither the presented code assist choice, 
nor the resulting try-catch block shows my prefered 
variable name "ex", but the old default value "e".

This seems to be related to the code templates.

Scenario 2 works for me when using quick fix to add the try-catch block. 

Scenario 1 shows the behavior described in comment 0 - the template used is not
aware of the code style prefernces, but the exception name is included verbatim
in the template.

You can work around the problem by changing the templates for 'catch' and 'try'
on the Java>Editor>Templates preference page.

A fix would need a new Variable type for the java context that would resolve to
an unused exception variable name.

new template variable

Here is a patch which introduces a new template which resolves to a unused name based on the predefined exception-name. Patch also includes the templates to use the new variable.
Thanks for the patch. Will look at this during M4.
Looked at the patch: looks good!
Two changes:
1. please add the copyright header as outlined in:
   http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php
2. it should be ExceptionVariableNameResolver and we should use "Exception 
   Variable Name" in the UI.

If I get an updated patch before next Monday I'll put it into M4.

updated patch

As you wished :)
- I've simplified your ExceptionVariableNameResolver code:
  - different super class
  - less code (just one single method)
- renamed the type to 'exception_variable_resolver'.
- changed JavaContext.computeExcludes() to only be package visible (not protected)
- updated doc: 
  /org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-preferences-template-variables.htm

Fixed in HEAD.
