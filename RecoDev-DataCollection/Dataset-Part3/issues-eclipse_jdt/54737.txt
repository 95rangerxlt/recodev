Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries:

The dialog does not seem to correctly remember the status of the items in 
the "Defined user libraries" tree.

When I leave the dialog I close (un-cascade) all items. When I open the dialog 
again, most of the items are open (cascaded) again.

This is disturbing because I cannot overview the items. It's like opening the 
Windows explorer with not only the drives shown but all folders being open.
