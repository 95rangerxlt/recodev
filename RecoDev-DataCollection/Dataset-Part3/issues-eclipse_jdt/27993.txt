build N20021209

- compared v1.6 and v1.7 of PreferencePage.java (in 
org.eclipse.jface.preference)
- the actual changes were just some changes to the Javadoc of two methods
- the diff (in both Sync and comparing the two revisions in the resource 
history) showed:
Compilation Unit
  PreferencePage
    preferenceStore
      isValid
        body
          createDefaultAndApplyButton
            defaultsButton
              container
                applyButton
                  descriptionLabel
                    size
                      getApplyButton()
                      getDefaultsButton()

The extra bits above were all the fields declared in that class, even though 
there were no changes to them.  Somehow they got nested.
Problem is not specific to this file.  Any compare I do has this problem.
Might be a problem in the Java parser too.

Consequence of #5295.

Fixed and released for I20021210
