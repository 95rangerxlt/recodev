I20030917 + plugin export for smoke test

Correct Indentation (Ctrl+I) causes problems in segmented java editor (Toolbar >
click "Show Source of selected element only").

- org.junit as source
- open TestCase.java
- enable "Show Source of selected element only"
- select method "run()" in outline
- set cursor to 1:1
- Ctrl+I
-> whole type becomes visible in editor

- select method "run()" in outline again
- manually mangle indentation by insterting/deleting tabs
- Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I
-> whole type becomes visible in editor
- Ctrl+Z (Undo)
-> the undo TextEdits are applied to the wrong offset and destroy +/- arbitrary
parts of my source!

"Show Source of selected element only" seems to be broken in a greater fashion:
- enable it
- select method run() in outline
- Organize Imports (Ctrl+Shift+O)
-> "Edit > Undo" is disabled, but should be enabled
Confirm both problems. Happens with Ctrl+I and Ctrl+Tab

Tom, please investigate.

Markus: The one in comment 2 has to do with action enablement while the other
one has to do with Tab/Indent source. Logged a separate PR: bug 43550 (feel free
to add yourself to the cc-list). Please don't add more than one bug into one PR.

see also bug 28253 (undo stack is widget oriented, gets cleared when segmented
view changes).

Calling selectAndReveal on the editor after indenting is too intrusive anyway...
we need to just set the selection, but not reveal.
