It seems the icons for the views change dynamically based on the selection of 
the previous view.  They should be static.
The projects view should always show a Java project icon.
The packages view should always show a package icon.
etc.

The behaviour is based on VA/Java. VA/J is input linking centric and there it 
makes sense to show the input icon. This approach doesn't match well with the 
focus centric linking in Eclipse. The pane icon should should represent its 
contents not its input.

Having said this, I'll order new icons that represent the contents of the view:
* projects a stack of projects
* packages a stack of packages
* types a stack of types (classes)
* methods view a stack of methods

I don't think new icons are necessary.
I would just use the regular icons: Java project, Package, Type (or Class), 
Member (or Method).

They are static now.
