When an explicit type import is added to resolved some ambiguity, organize 
imports will ignore it, and replace it with an on-demand import if the threshold
is reached.

e.g. set folding threshold to 2
     after using organize import on following 4 files test case, a compiler 
error will be detected against X.java, since Compiler has now become an 
ambiguous type.
---------------------- X.java
import a.Compiler;
import a.A;
import a.B;
public class X {
 Compiler c;
}
---------------------- a/Compiler.java
package a;
public class Compiler {
}
---------------------- a/A.java
package a;
public class A {
}
---------------------- a/B.java
package a;
public class B {
}
