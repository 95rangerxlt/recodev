1.	Create project P1
2. 	Create folder 'txt' not on the classpath
3.	Add compilation unit Outside.java using class wizard (location P1/txt, 
no package)

// would indicate wrong delta got fired

5.	Force close/reopen project P1
6.	Package view shows 'Outside.java' under P1/txt

Fixed delta problem by changing the involved JavaModelOperations to not create 
deltas if the cu is not in the classpath (the delta processor creates the 
correct non-java resource delta).

Fixed model info problem by hooking in the WorkingCopy.destroy() method so that 
it closes the original element if it was not in the classpath.
