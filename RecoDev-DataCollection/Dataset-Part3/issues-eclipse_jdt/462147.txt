I have added the new APIs (including VERSION_1_8 related) to the documentation.

I happened to look at this page and wondering if this is outdated:

eclipse.platform.common/bundles/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/preferences/java/ref-preferences-compiler.htm

Esp. the default values shows compliance level at 1.4 etc. But if Eclipse must be run with a 1.7 JRE or above, the default compliance that the preference page will have is 1.7, no?

No. The default is to match the selected default JRE. Note though, that 'Restore Defaults' only works once per session.

See bug 467582.

I understand that. I wasn't clear enough in my previous post. Considering that

1) Eclipse needs 1.7 or above JRE to run (and)
2) The compliance matches the JRE that eclipse is running with

We can never have default compliance levels mentioned (like 1.4), can we? I know this page reflects what we have in JavaCore#COMPILER_COMPLIANCE and such, but the question arises because the page mentions "Java compiler preference page".

Yes, we can! Just set a 1.4 JRE as default JRE and then press 'Restore Defaults' on the 'Compiler' preference page.
Was this fixed for RC2? Or should target be changed?
I still need to document two new options of the batch compiler.
Via http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.common.git/commit/?id=2bd6646bf3c3ba77fd1bdaf335edf3117b4bd542

I added
 -syntacticAnalysis
 -annotationpath

I noticed two remaining issues, though:

(1) Option -genericsignature is not yet documented. When looking for the right place to add this I got confused by finding -parameters under debug options, not "advanced" like it says from "ecj -help".


(2) In messages.properties (batch), the "+" in 
    switchDefault      + switch statement lacking a default case
looks wrong to me. Help says "-".
See that
- CompilerOptions.MissingDefaultCase is not in IrritantSet.COMPILER_DEFAULT_WARNINGS
- JavaCore.COMPILER_PB_SWITCH_MISSING_DEFAULT_CASE says "ignore"

Back to you, Jay.

I have decided to leave -parameters untouched but put -genericsignature under advanced section.
And I think this can be closed now.

This change is causing a test failure:

http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/I20150602-2000/testresults/html/org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler_win32.win32.x86_7.0.html

Of course, the fix is a test-only fix. Will keep it handy and release if we have any rebuild requests.

Released now:

For the records, this file should also have been updated for new options:

Is there a bug to do this for master and SR1?
