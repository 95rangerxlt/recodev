- create CU
public class QuickFixTest {
	public static class TT {

	public void foo(TTT t) {
	}
}

- try to quick fix foo(TTT t)

All you get is the bell.

This is surprising since foo(String2 s) can be fixed.

we should show an empty quick fix window that explains no quick fix available.
I always have the bell turned off and click twice to confirm that there really 
is no quick fix.
