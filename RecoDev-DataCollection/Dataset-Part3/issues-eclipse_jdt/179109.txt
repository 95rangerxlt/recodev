Build: I20070322-1800

I did Open Type, and it was taking a long time to open the editor after I clicked finish.  I produced a stack dump while I was waiting, and I noticed that there are two threads creating an AST at the same time. Presumably they are even generating the same AST. It would be good to avoid creating the same AST multiple times when the editor is first opened.

Stack trace
This should not happen. Did you open a class file editor or a CU editor?
John, I ran the ASTProvider traces and I'm pretty sure that you opened a binary class - can you confirm that I'm on the right track?
Yes, I believe I opened a binary type in this case.
This was caused by a timing issue and code being too optimistic about the event flow and was in there since at least 3.1. Good catch!

Fixed in HEAD.
