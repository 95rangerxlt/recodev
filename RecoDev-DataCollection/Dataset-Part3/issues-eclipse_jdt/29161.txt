If I have a class like this:

public class Foo {
  private static final String BAR = "bar";
  public Foo () {
      System.out.println(this.BAR);
  }
}

There's a light bulb on the 'this.BAR' line, which says "The static field
Foo.BAR should be accessed in a static way", but says "No corrections available"
when I click on it.

The fix is simply removing 'this', ie "this.BAR" becomes only "BAR". It's a very
simple correction, I think quick fix should know about it.

Note that the type of the qualifier should be used instead (and nothing if 
within same type).
