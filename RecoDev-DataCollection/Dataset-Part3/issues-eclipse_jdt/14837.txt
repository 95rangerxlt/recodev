folders like that are actually IPackageFragments and there may be references to 
them in the form of imports-on-demand (.*)
This is right but IMO this is a rare case. I still think that it looks starnge 
to have the search actions on a folder. If a user want to search for folders he 
can use the search dialog.

BTW, we removed a lot of actions from the context menu which are of rare use as 
long as they can be activated from the global menu or tool bar.
canOperateOn for declaration and reference actions need tweaking.

Fixed.
