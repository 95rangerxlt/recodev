0125

1. Create a workspace with binary projects for all of 0125 (copy content)
2. Open on Type JavaProject and select the method getSharedProperty in the 
outliner.
3. Select references in hierarchy
-> No results are returned.

NOTE: Select references in workspace
->3 results are returned (including two that are in the hierarchy)

NOTE: It appears that hierarchy scope is matching on the actual path to the 
jar, not the logical path to the jar.

HierarchyScope was following the spec of IJavaSearchScope that stated that the 
path to the jar was always the OS path. This is not true any more. Changed 
implenmentation of HierarchyScope as suggested by John, and changed the spec to 
state that the jar path is the OS path if it is an external jar, and it is the 
workspace relative path if it is an internal jar.
