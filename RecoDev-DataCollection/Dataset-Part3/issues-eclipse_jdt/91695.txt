As part of the performance effort in M7, we have created an Ant task to build 
search index for document plug-ins as part of the regular build. Please apply 
the patches in this defect against org.eclipse.jdt.doc.* plug-ins (user and 
isv) so that index building is enabled.

Thanks for the patches.

Fixed in HEAD.
Released to I20050419-0800.
Thanks Dani.
Great - we can now have a complete index on every build. It is worth it - 
first-time help search will now take only couple of seconds.
Sorry, the attached patches were not correct. I placed the antcall for build 
indexing in wrong targets. Attached are revised patches that should be 'it'.
Created attachment 20086
The corrected doc.user patch

The corrected doc.isv patch
Fixed in HEAD.
For what it's worth, I hit one minor (in retrospect, obvious) problem
implementing the patches defined here. This is mostly since our build.xml files
aren't exactly verbatim to the ones for doc.user or doc.isv - as such, I had to
manually stick in the new code:

	<target name="build.jars" depends="init" description="Build all the jars for
the plug-in: org.eclipse.emf.doc.">

  ...
		<antcall target="build.index"/> <!-- new call -->

		<zip destfile="${build.result.folder}/doc.zip">
			<zipfileset dir="index" prefix="index"/> <!-- new fileset -->
			<zipfileset dir="references" prefix="references"/>
			<zipfileset dir="images" prefix="images"/>
			<zipfileset dir="tutorials" prefix="tutorials"/>
			<zipfileset dir="css" prefix="css"/>
		</zip>
	</target>

	<!-- new target -->
	<target name="build.index" depends="init" description="Builds search index for
the plug-in" if="eclipse.running"> 
		<help.buildHelpIndex manifest="plugin.xml" destination="."/>
	</target>

The part I missed, which doesn't seem to appear in the patch files, is that you
need to actually include the <zipfileset dir="index" prefix="index"/> part when
zipping the doc.zip archive. Again, seems obvious now, but I thought I'd
document this gotcha for anyone else that *might* hit the same wall I did in
manually copying over patched code into their customized build.xml scripts.
