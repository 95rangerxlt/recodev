There should be an option to run CleanUp on source file without any questions asked, just like with Formatter.

Hm, maybe I'll say why :) I suggest it because it's very very useful tool and I think to improve its usability and allow users to use it as often as possible it should be as quick and painless to use as can be done.
This option already exists: It's on the Clean Up preference page, but it's really not obvious. We have to improve the label.

- Rename the label on the clean preference page: 'Don't show 'Clean Up' dialog when invoked on a single file'
- Add a link to the 'Clean Up dialog': 'Note: Configure >here< to hide this dialog for single files'

Either the wizard is shown or not, depending on the setting on the preference page. It does not matter if one or more cus are selected. IMHO the label is pretty straight forward: "Show the Clean Up Wizard". Maybe "Show the Clean Up Wizard when executing the Clean Up Action". But isn't that obvious?

Agreed.
