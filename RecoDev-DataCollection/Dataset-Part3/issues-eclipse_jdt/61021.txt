The shortcut for the NON-NLS is too long to type. Why not simply: "nls" ?
This is the one we had defined when no default was provided.

Can't you type non + code assist? I guess you like it better because there are

I'd rather have shorter template shortcuts, so nls seems more appropriate as 
it is related to nls support anyway.
