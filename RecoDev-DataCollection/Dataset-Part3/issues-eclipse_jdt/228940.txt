Build Id: I20080422-0800
I have set up a personal formatter profile, with:

Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter : Edit :
  "Line Wrapping" : Maximum Width = 160, Wrap only when necessary

This profile is used in the save actions for formatting those lines of code that I have edited. Now this works nicely for Java code, but following line (one line in original):

	public final static String IMAGE_DIR_ELCL = IMAGE_DIR_ROOT + "elcl16/"; // enabled - size 16x16 //$NON-NLS-1$

wraps as follows on Save:

	public final static String IMAGE_DIR_ELCL = IMAGE_DIR_ROOT + "elcl16/"; // enabled
																			// -
																			// size
																			// 16x16
																			// //$NON-NLS-1$


That is, the inline comment at the end is wrapped one word per line. Which makes a warning appear, because the //$NON-NLS-1$ tag is no longer on the same line as the constant. 

Workaround is to Edit > "Undo Save Action" after every save. That's making me crazy... please get it fixed!

Yes Sir! it's fixed. I can reproduce in I20080422-0800 but not in HEAD, this got fixed with bug 227098 (see corresponding changes in CleanUpStressTest for test cases for this bug)

Btw. another workaround would be to change the comment to:
..."elcl16/"; //$NON-NLS-1$//enabled - size 16x16

I saw this again in I20080516-1333 (3.4RC1) but not as frequently:

* Have two long lines in JDT editor
* Comment them with // in beginning
* Press save

  --> My 2 // commented lines are wrapped into 4 lines.

I will continue watching this in RC2 and beyond.

Sorry, I can not reproduce that. Please provide exact steps. In I20080523-0100 the single line comments are not wrapped if they end with //$NON-NLS-1$
