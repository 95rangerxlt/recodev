Eclipse 3.0 M4

This is just a single example of a common UI problem that exists in a wide 
variety of places in Eclipse, not just JDT.

If you're going to allow a dialog/window to be resized (which I think you 
should), then some careful thought needs to go into how the widgets resize.  
Look at the preferences page for the JDT's Code Formatter and you'll see that 
when the dialog is resized the (really useful) preview text widget does not 
stretch and consume the remaining whitespace.  Take a look at the screen shot 
of the dialog in various sizes to see what I mean.

Screen shot
Another offender in the JDT is the "Task Tags" preference page.  The table of 
task tags should stretch to consume the remaining vertical whitespace.  
Currenly, you get scrollbars on the table after adding only a few items.  
Again, see the screen shot.

Screeshot of task tags preference page.
Fixed the 'Task Tags preference page'. Moving to Silvio to remember this for the
new formatter page.
Fixed with the new formatter page >= I20031202
Eclipse 3.0 M6

A couple of more resize-offenders in the preference pages:

  Workbench > Editors > Text Editor
  - "Annotations" page, the list has scroll bars, yet it does not consume the
    remaining vertical whitespace.

  Java > Installed JREs
  - Table is positioned incorrectly and does not consume the remaining vertical 
  whitespace.

While looking at M7 today I saw another "resize offender" in the new code 
formatting "Show Profile" dialog.  See that attached screen shot.

Line Wrapping notebook page
This was not a size offender but just the non controls that are not visible if 
a parent node is selected
released the patch by erl to have the controls always shown, but disabled when 
a parent node is selected
