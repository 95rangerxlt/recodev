Editor is not stale but empty: when the editor receives the elementMoved event
(in UI thread) the movedElement no longer exists because another un/redo has
already happened. Instead of a resource text file buffer we get an empty Java
text file buffer for a non-existing file. We end up with IFileEditorInput that
has no IFile and which creates a CU for that non-existing IFile.

The problem is that we do a asyncExec when in AbstractTextEditor.execute(...).
This has been introduced by the fix for bug 76765.
Fixed in AbstractTextEditor.ElementStateListener.elementMoved(...)
