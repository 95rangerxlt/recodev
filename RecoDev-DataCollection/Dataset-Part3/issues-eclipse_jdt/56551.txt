I exported Javadoc for a class (checked the rt.jar on page 2).
When exporting the next time and pressing Finish it does not recognize types
which are in previously selected rt.jar.

Probably related to bug 56550.

Note that only selections are remembered that have a Javadoc location 
configured (I improved the feedback here to give a warning when you select a 
reference that is not configured yet)
