1. Create Java project 'Test'
2. Create compilation unit X.java
3. Edit X.java and make the editor dirty (so leave it unsaved)
4. Delete project 'Test'
Observe: The editor is left opened. 

If you give it focus, you get an error dialog: 
Problems managing bookmarks.
Reason: Resource /Test/X.java does not exist.

not closing the editor is good since it ensures that the user doesn't loose 
changes, but the exception should not happen. It is a duplicate of another bug.
The managing bookmark problem has been solved. Leaving dirty editor open is the 
intended behavior as it avoids unintentional loss of data.
