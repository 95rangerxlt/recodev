Everytime you format a comment with a blank line another blank line is added.

STEPS
1)Add a comment like this:

	/**
	 * Get the progress monitor for a job. If it is a UIJob get the main
	 * monitor from the status line. Otherwise get a background monitor.
	 * 
	 * @return IProgressMonitor
	 */

2) Make a change in another method and format. It will look this this 
afterwards

	/**
	 * Get the progress monitor for a job. If it is a UIJob get the main
	 * monitor from the status line. Otherwise get a background monitor.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @return IProgressMonitor
	 */

Tobias, any comments? Is this a preference?

This is a bug. The new preference "Clear all blank lines", if disabled, adds 
the additional blank line before <pre>,<q> and the Javadoc tag block start (in 
this case @return.

Attaching a fix.
Created attachment 6231
Fixes "Clear blank lines" preference
Applied the patch.
I rejected the changes in the CommentFormattingStrategy: there is no obvious
reason which would belong to this bug or the patch for changing the static util
method from protected to public. What was the reason for it?


You are right. This is not related to this bug. However, the utility method had 
to be made public for unit testing.
ok. then we'll release along with the tests ;-=
