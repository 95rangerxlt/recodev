..... Similary whenever a template is used and it uses types which are not 
imported it would be nice to be able to specify in the template which imports 
are required or to just run the "organise imports" function after every 
template is used.

*** Bug 46289 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
I'd rather have the possibility to explicitly mention the required imports for 
a certain template.  Because I use the Logger from the apache commons project.  
now everytime I do an organize imports after adding a template mentioning this 
Logger class I have to select the correct Logger from the organize imports Type 
selector.  this is a but silly, because when one writes a template they know 
exactly which class is meant to be used.
Patrice, et al:

please refer to bug 46289 for my take on how this should work.

if you use fully-qualified names in the template (with the requested option 'add
imports where possible'), it's the same as explicitly mentioning which imports
to add. plus, it provides a fallback if the import creates ambiguity (for
example, you tell it to add the Log4j 'Log' when another 'Log' has already been
imported).
i should mention now that jdk 5.0 is out, it would probably NOT be a good idea
to include static imports with this. for example, if someone adds a
"System.out.println()" to their code, they probably don't want to import
"System.out".
See also bug 10694.

The new 'name' template variable type will automatically add an import for the referenced type.
This is now called newName.
