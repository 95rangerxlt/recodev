The Execution Arguments page in the properties for a class with a main method 
is ignored.  It appears that it was left in even though there is a launcher 
placed at each execution of a program that allows you to set the options.  If 
the launcher options are going to be displayed every time, it has been 
suggested that the old way of doing the same thing in the UI be removed.
