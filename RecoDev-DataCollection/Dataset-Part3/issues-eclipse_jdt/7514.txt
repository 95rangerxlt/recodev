Binary projects imported using the selfhosting plug-in are not distinguished in 
any way from regular projects. It is very easy to loose track of which is which 
when there are dozens and dozens of projects in the workspace. It is easy to 
start editing files that are in the install tree (if the install tree location 
is not read-only).

We need to somehow mark these projects so that they are visible, at least in 
the 'Packages' view. We can use a persistent project property to tag binary 
projects imported for selfhosting. This tag could be used in various areas 
where spacial handling is needed. In the context of this feature, the tag could 
be used by 'Packages' view label provided to use different project icon or 
overlay to mark binary projects.

the PDE contributed label decorators baddress this problem.
the packages view got fixed to support the adornment.
