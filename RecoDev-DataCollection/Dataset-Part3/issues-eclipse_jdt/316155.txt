Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

I have plugins A, B and C which is a fragment to B.
A is a test harness which creates a JUnit3 TestSuite, containing test classes from both B and C. A is dependent on B.
When a test in B fails, I can open the test class from the JUnit view. When a test in C fails, I get the "Test class not found in selected project" error.

This is related to bug 87492: that added code to look for source in non-exported packages of dependent plugins; what is still missing is looking for source in _fragments_ of dependent plugins (which may not be dependencies themselves).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
see above

Moving to JDT.
Created attachment 171845
3 plug-in projects to reproduce

To reproduce, run FragTest and then try to open "frag.Frag.run" from the JUnit view.
Fixed in OpenEditorAction.

The fix is not perfect: It just falls back to searching the type in the workspace if not found in the project, so it could open a wrong one if there are multiple declarations of the same type. A more elaborate strategy could be considered when bug 72847 gets fixed.
