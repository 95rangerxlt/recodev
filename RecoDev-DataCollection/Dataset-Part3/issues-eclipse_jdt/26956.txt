Build I20021119

Create the following structure

Test
  src
    org.eclipse.code
  tests
    org.eclipse.code.tests

Now try to rename org.eclipse.code.tests to org.eclipse.code.

You get an error that the package already exists in project Test. That's 
correct but the package lies in a different source folder. We should allow this 
case.

nasty case - it means that compile errors may show up as a result of this 
(duplicated type names)

i think i will chnage the error to a warning in this case 
(and additionally add additional warnings if there will be duplicated type names)
fixed
