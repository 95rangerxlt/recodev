Java structure compare hides changes when the 'Ignore White Space Where Applicable' toolbar toggle is enabled.

To reproduce, compare rev. 1.45 and 1.46 of org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ITypeBinding.   Without 'Ignore White Space', there's a change in getQualifiedName(). With the option enabled, the Java Structure Compare pane does not show the change any more.

I just ran into this again today. Any chance for a fix for 3.3?
I assume you're asking me. Now that I know about it, I'll see what I can do ;-)

Patch to JDT/UI

The problem was that the ignore whitespace comparison was treating comments as whitespace. I'm not sure why that was (perhaps its an indication of the original authors feelings towards comments ;-). Here's a patch that limits the check to whitespace.
Moving to JDT/UI to consider patch.
Thanks, Michael. Released patch to HEAD.
This will go into I20070501-0010.
