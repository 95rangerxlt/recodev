- The description of the open dialog could be more specific, e.g. replace 
element by file
- The entries in the open dialog are to wide, causing scrollbars to be shown 
initially. A simple tree view like in ElementTreeSelectionDialog would do the 
trick, not giving up the option to type in the item to be opened
- Several matches in the same file should be indicated as in the search result 
view (file name + # of matches in parentheses)
- The offset/length indication is useless: The length is the same anyway, and 
the offset cannot be easily used to differentiate between the results. A five-
lines-high preview of the location would help, or a popup similar as the 
additional info popup for content assist proposals.

Done.

Fixed. I'm now using a TwoPaneElementSelector dialog which shows the file name
in the upper pane and
  Line# - Full path
in the lower pane. The lower pane is currently not correctly sorted (see bug 84220).
