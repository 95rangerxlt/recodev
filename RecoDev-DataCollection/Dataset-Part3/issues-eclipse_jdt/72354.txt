On the newsgroups I have seen many people (mostly beginners) complaining about 
not seeing full cource of their classes. It always turns out that they 
accidentally clicked the "Show Source of Selected Element Only" toolbar button.

Here are few possible enhancements:

1. When the "Show Source of Selected Element Only" is clicked show a message 
dialog indicating how to get out of the state. The dialog could have "Do not 
show this message" checbbox. The message showing behaviour should be 
recoverable from the Java:Editor preferences page.

Alternatively:

2. Make "Show Source of Selected Element Only" a preference.
2.1 Move "Show Source of Selected Element Only" to a submenu under Source i.e. 
making it difficult to get into. It should be possible for an expert to show 
it on the toolbar also.

3. Always indicate the state in the editor - a label at top with instructions 
on how to get out of the state. Or a icon on the Editor tab with a tooltip 
showing how to get out of the state.

We will at least make the state visible as preference.
See also bug 20155 which asks to replace it with a preference. It contains some
other ideas like putting the state into the editor tab (context menu).
