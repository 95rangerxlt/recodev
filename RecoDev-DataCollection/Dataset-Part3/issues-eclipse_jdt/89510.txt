I work on a dual monitor setup and have the eclipse workspace (no detached
windows) open on the right screen.
- Open the Extract Interface wizard (open correctly on the same monitor as
Eclipse), enter a name, press 'Preview'
- The preview wizard window opens on the left screen
This is infrastructure related. The preview simply enlarges the normal dialog. I
suspect that I am using the display and not the monitor of the shell to
calculate the new positions.

This bug will affect all refactorings.
The problem is that the widht/height has to be constraint to the monitor however
x/y to the display.
