I have a 15" notebook and a second 19" TFT monitor. I have them set up the way that I can display different content in both of them (see Eclipse on one monitor and the running application in the second).

When I use the content assist of Eclipse JDT it will display the yellow explanation window going outside Eclipse's border and being displayed half on the first and half on the second screen. This makes it very hard to read.

Eclipse window is maximized in screen one, if this matters.

I'll attach a screenschot showing the situation.

Tom, did your recent changes fix this?

Torsten, can you try whether it works better using I20060620-1010?
This should be fixed with the recent placement and sizing changes for content assist and information controls. Please reopen if you still see this with I20060620. 
I've tested today with I20060620-1010 and it worked, thank you!
