- Have a CU with contents
"package copying;

public class Class {

}" (no linebreak here)

- collapse class folding
-> a "}" remains on the last line. Expected: last line is empty

- set caret to end of text and press Enter
-> after reconciling, there are two boxes with dots. Expected: only one box.

=> Folding at the end of file is only correct if the file ends with at least two
empty lines.

The marker of the folded region is too short already in the unexpanded state.

Cannot reproduce. Please add more steps (e.g. is end of text end of file?)

Cannot reproduce. Please add more steps. I have:
package org.eclipse.ui.texteditor;

public class Class {
	
}
<caret>

and folding works for me using I20050215-2300

Regression: in 3.0 the marker in the ruler has the correct length. BUT: when
folding it shows two boxes [..].

Tom, please investigate whether we can fix this for M5 (low prio).
The difference is, that in my example, there's no tab character on the empty
line inside the class declaration.
I deliberately changed this to avoid the double boxes... Java folding is
entirely line base currently, we don't have a story for a line without delimiter.
We can still fold the entire region, but the last incomplete line will still
show as an empty line after folding. 

Fix ready, M5 candidate.

fixed reviewed by Daniel Megert

the following two problem persist (already in 3.0)
- in some cases two boxes are shown. 
- when expanding a projection with an incomplete last line, the unfolded region
is selected.
