gotoMarker does not set source range and does not update outline view.
	JavaEditor.gotoMarker should
	- set the source range annotation (setHighlightRange)
	- set the selection of the outline viewer (fOutline.select(...))


NOTES:

KUM (1/26/01 4:57:15 PM)
	Fixed. 
	There is issue left, which is when opening a bookmark must open an editor. Then, the opening code 
	ruins the range selection and resets it to the public type of the editor's input element. We should
	reconsider the opening behavior of editor's especially in the case of segmented source presentation.

EG (1/29/01 1:10:13 PM)
	please move the PR to active issues once verified. So that we track the left over.

	Verified --> OK - moving to "Active issues"
