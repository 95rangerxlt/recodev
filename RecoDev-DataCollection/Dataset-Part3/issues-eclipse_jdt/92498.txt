A strange symptom from suggestArgumentNames happens with the following:

public class A {
	int orderNo;
	int fieldNo;
	int shipNo;
}
Using generate constructor using fields wields this:

	public A(int no, int no, int no) {
		super();
		orderNo= no;
		fieldNo= no;
		shipNo= no;
	}

All three param names the same. It would make sense to track the ones previously
created and ensure no duplicates.

patch

Rename getParameterName to getUniqueParameterName and use existing
functionality from NamingConventions.suggestArgumentNames which allows for the
last argument to be an exclude list.

Add some logic to StubUtility2.createConstructorStub to save and pass param
names to suggester.
Tobias, can you please comment.
This is fixed in head
