When using the the tree view in the package explorer, package com.foo.bar is shown as a child of package com.foo. 
Therefore the CVS label decorations of package com.foo should mark it as dirty even if only com.foo.bar contains dirty files. So the label decoration should be recursive, as they were before Version 3.2 M5.

This would make it a lot easier to find edited files for commit, when the tree nodes are collapsed. 

IHMO the CVS actions should also be recursive, when using the tree view. However, I understand that this can be dangerous when committing/replacing files unintentionally.

I agree. Tobias, would it be possible to change the behavior in the package explorer, depending on the package presentation?

Package Explorer/Packages view now uses a decoration context to modify the SynchronizationStateTester when in hierarchical mode.

Note that this is a fix just for the team decorators. I'll file a request to generalize this so that also other decorators can be fixed.
In general, actions and decorators always work on the model structure, not on the view structure. E.g. a commit on a hierarchical package still only releases the compilation units directly inside, but no subpackages (see bug 131969)
