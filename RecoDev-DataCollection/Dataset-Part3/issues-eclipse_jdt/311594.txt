We use the test plugin org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests in the Object Teams build.

When trying to build this plugin on build.eclipse.org running on 
ibm-java-ppc64-60-SR7 it won't be built by pde.build, because the classpath
is broken (the given JRE has its vm.jar hidden in an unusual location
cf. Bug 311425).

However, when I patch the plugin's MANIFEST.MF adding this line:

Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: J2SE-1.4

everything's cool. 

Would you mind adding this?
