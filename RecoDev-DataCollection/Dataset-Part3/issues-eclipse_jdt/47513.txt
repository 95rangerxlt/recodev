Start typing in a Java file. When you type "for (", smart-indent adds the 
matching ")". Then add "int n=0; n<12; n++". Because smart-indent detected a 
semicolon, it cancels the jump-over-the-matching-brace. Therefore, typing ")" 
will result in "for (int n=0; n<12; n++))". Same effect with "while (true;)".

Happended with 3.0M3, and also with M4. Have not tested with M5.

I believe the for loop thing is fixed in the newest integration build; please
reopen if you still see this.

About the while - this will work or not, depending on whether you've got smart
Semicolon turned on; if yes, the semi will be placed after the closing
parenthesis (guess statement lists are not that common?).
