When using a non-proportional font, (I'm using Trebuchet) and hovering over a 
piece of code such as:
GridData.HORIZONTAL_ALIGN_END

the tool tip that appears is not long enough for the contained text:
int org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData.HORIZONTAL_AL

is all that is shown...

Which build are you using?
Could not reproduce in winXP, I20020226.
I found this using Eclipse 3.0 build M7.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Set the default font to a non-proportional font
2) Enter text: GridData.HORIZONTAL_ALIGN_END
3) place mouse over text

The tooltip that appears will not be large enough for the text contained.

I can provide a screen shot if that would be useful.
I cannot reproduce it with this given steps. However, I see it, e.g., with 
some field declarations etc.
a) change text font to Verdana 9
b) open DefaultInformationControl
c) in method "setInformation" hover over fMaxWidth

Fixed in HEAD by using the Browser widget and wrap mode.
