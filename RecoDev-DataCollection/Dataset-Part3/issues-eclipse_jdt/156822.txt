If you have only one string to externalize, open the Externalizes Strings Wizard. All the three buttons (Externalize, Ignore, Internalize) are enabled. But if you click on one of them, nothing happens besides they get disabled because the no string in the table is selected when the dialog opens. Now we have to ways:
a) disable them at startuo if nothing is selected
b) select the first entry automatically if there is only one entry

In my eyes, option b) is the better approach to have a smart user interaction.

I'll provide a patch for the second way tomorrow if nobody has a problem with this.
