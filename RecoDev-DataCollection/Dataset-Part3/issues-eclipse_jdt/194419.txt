3.3 RC4

Several manifest.mf files have incompatible versions for required plug-ins.

- jdt.ui says it needs ui.navigator 3.2 but uses 3.3 extension point elements
- core.expression uses Assert but says it can live with 3.1 runtime

Those are just examples. All plug-ins need to be checked.

This is not a major issues as normally the whole SDK is updated as a whole and hence no problems will occur.

*LTK* and *JUnit* plug-ins also need to be checked.

The strategy used by JDT/UI and friend is to always require the latest major version of its depended plug-ins, even if it would be possible to use a smaller version that provides all the required APIs.

The latest version is the version we test against and on whose behavior we rely.
