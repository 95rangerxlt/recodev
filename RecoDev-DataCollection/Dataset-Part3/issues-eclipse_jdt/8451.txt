I believe this has come up on the newsgroup but I can't find a feature request 
for it...

It would be nice to have three options for code assist matching/sorting:

1) Case-sensitive matching
2) Case-insensitive matching, but sorted with matching case first
3) Case-insensitive matching and case-insensitive sorting

completion proposal are now sorted accoridng relevance and case sensitive is 
consdidered as part of this computation.
This doesn't seem to work for me in F2. Sample program:

public class Test 
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int abc=0;
        int ABC=0;
        int AbC=0;
        
        int x = Ab(CURSOR HERE)
    }
}

Pressing ctrl-space gives loads of classes before abc, and doesn't list ABC or
AbC at all.

Note - it would be nice to also prefer "local" things (eg local/class/instance
variables, methods) to classes, as this is much more common.

Further bug (possibly part of a bigger problem, no idea!): hitting backspace
twice in the above example (after hitting ctrl-space, of course) presents a
smaller selection - typing Ab in afterwards should get back to the original
list, I'd have thought.
Changing the code to:

        int abcd1=0;
        int ABCD2=0;
        int AbCd3=0;
        
        int x = AbC(CURSOR)

makes things behave as expected. It looks like the bug is due to a failure to
cope with variables (and presumably other entities) which have the same name
other than case. That's not too much of a problem. Not sure about the other
issues raised in the previous comment: Erich, I'll let you decide whether they
should be dealt with in this bug, not dealt with at all, or opened as new bugs :)

The new problem is different. Filed a separate  bug 19254 so that we can close 
this one
