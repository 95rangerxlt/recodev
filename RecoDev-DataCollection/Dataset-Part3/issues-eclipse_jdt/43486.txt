I20030917: Method get(int offset, int length) gives an 
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Steps to reproduce:

-Enable sequential rewriting for a document
-call document.replace(0, document.getLength(), "Some text");
-call document.get(5, 4) to get back "text"

Reason: Call to String.substring(int,int) uses offset and length instead of 
two indices.

Fix: Replace length by end index + 1
