		for (;;) {
			//---
			if (i == 0)
				continue;	
			if (i != 5)	
				continue;	
			//---	
		}
	}
	}

	1. extract the select fragment
	you get 2 error saying that '...selection...continue...target...not selected'
	two exactly same messages - line numvers would make them more informative.

The idea is to provide a context to show the source to the user
Whenever possible we are no using a context to give a hint to the user what has 
caused the problem. Unfortunatelly we can only highlight one text portion (see 
http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=11096).

For the described test case we only generate one error message now.

Fixed in build > 20020307.
