It already inserts the asterisk characters for you when you hit enter.  All you 
have to do is add the trailing "/" after you have finished adding text and tags. 
 It even automatically removes the space after the asterisk when you add "/".  
Maybe I misunderstand what you're asking?  You want to hit enter after /** and 
get this:

/**
 *
 */

Is that what you're asking?
Actually I was thinking that in addition to inserting the asterisk (which is 
definitely good), after I hit /** and then enter, it would look like the 
following.  The cursor is where the '|' is.  It would fill out the javadoc tags 
depending on what followed the comment whether it is a method, class or field, 
(or nothing).  Even if it didn't fill out the @ tags, at least in each case I 
think it should close off the trailing */ for you.  Maybe make a checkbox 
option somewhere whether to fill out javadoc comments automatically or not.

/**
 * |
 * @param myparam
 * @return
 * @throws
 */
Moving to JDT UI for comment.  I think defining a method javadoc template could 
address this.
Related to the current improvments of the Javadoc auto indent strategy.

It does the same as "Source :: Add JavaDoc Comment" including adding @see tag
in case of an inherited method.

I don't see the value of a method javadoc template yet.
Checkbox option will follow.
preference options have been added >= 20020911 (not in integration build)
