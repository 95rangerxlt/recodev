The JUnit result comparison dialog is not updated after a failed test is rerun.
The compare viewer still shows the first comparison when the Failure Trace
already shows a different error (because my fix was not as expected).

I'm debugging a JUnit Plug-in Test and have 'Keep JUnit running after a test run
when debugging' enabled.
