If I use code assist in an anonymous inner type then the proposal is fully
qualified even if this is not necessary. This is really annoying since the ful 
qualification is 99% of the time not needed. Please make this an option or do 
only fully qualify if the qulification is needed. Example:

class A {
  Object element;
  public void m {
    Runnable runnable= new Runnable() {
      public void run() {
        element<code assist> produces A.this.element   
      }
    }
  }
}
