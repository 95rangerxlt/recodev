in a large file (SWT.java)
i cut something from within a comment and undid the action
it allocated a lot of objects - including 3Mb of char[]
attached is allocation backtrace

seems like calling codeselect allocates a lot of stuff - maybe unnecessarily or 
maybe we could avoid calling it on every keystroke

The memory is allocated by ICompilationUnit.codeSelect(). There is a bug report 
for this (bug 27321). 

But from looking at the code it seems that the result of the method 
getCurrentTextRegion isn't used in keyPressed. So may be the call can be 
removed?
cannot reproduce this problem anuymore
the code in JavaEditor.MouseClickListener.keyPressed is still problematic 
however (looks like the last follwoing lines can simply be removed - nothing 
seems to be done with the their result)

			ISourceViewer viewer= getSourceViewer();
			if (viewer == null)
				return;
			
			IRegion region= getCurrentTextRegion(viewer);
			if (region == null)
				return;


Code changed as proposed in build > 20021210.
