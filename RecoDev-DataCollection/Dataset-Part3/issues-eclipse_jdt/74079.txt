I see no obvious reason for the hints and the content assist to disappear when I
use this key, as technically I don't change anything related to the state of my
editor. This is not a major issue, just annoying from a usability point of view,
as I often use CAPS-LOCK for entering constant values.

Happens because the CAPS_LOCK is not reported as modifier key.
