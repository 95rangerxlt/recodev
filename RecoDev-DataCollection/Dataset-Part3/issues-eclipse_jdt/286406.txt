default Java import method

Build ID: 20090619-0625

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Download the ZIP file attached, it will be in a DoubleIt folder that contains one Eclipse subproject (service-war).

2. Now, import DoubleIt into Eclipse.  File -> New -> Java Project -> Create Project from existing Source ->
Choose "DoubleIt" folder and click "Next".
 
3. The default source code import is not loading from service-war/target/generated-sources correctly--creates subsequent classpath problems if not manually changed on this page. org.example.contract.doubleit under this folder loads correctly but not org.example.schema.doubleit--unsure why one would but not the other.  

More information:
The .classpath entry of the default (incorrect) source file detection is this:

<classpath>
        ...
	<classpathentry excluding="org/example/schema/doubleit/" kind="src" path="service-war/target/generated-sources"/>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="service-war/target/generated-sources/org/example/schema/doubleit"/>

It should be this by default:

<classpath>
...
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="service-war/target/generated-sources"/>
...

The incorrect default causes Eclipse to complain that classes in the org.example.schema.doubleit package should have a package name of "" (empty string).

I'm attaching screenshots showing the bad default and what should be the good default, as well as the Navigator view consequences of having the bad default.

(Note: screenshots from Eclipse 3.4 but verified same problem with 3.5.)

project zip file that demonstrates problem
The wizard fails to parse DoubleIt/service-war/target/generated-sources/org/example/schema/doubleit/package-info.java because it has an annotation on the package.
Fixed in HEAD of ClassPathDetector.
