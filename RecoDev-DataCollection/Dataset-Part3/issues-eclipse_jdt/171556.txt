If I have an abstract test case with a junit4 test, the test runner doesn't run any of the tests from the abstract test case when running from the concrete class.

In the example below, the Eclipse test runner does not find any tests when trying to run the tests from ConcreteTestCase. I tried to trick Eclipse by sticking a dummy test method in ConcreteTestCase but it still did not run the test methods in the abstract class:

public abstract class AbstracTestCase {

@Test
public void testSomething() {
   assertSomething();
}

public abstract void assertSomething();
}

public class ConcreteTestCase extends AbstractTestCase {
   
   public void assertSomething() {
      Assert.assertTrue(Boolean.TRUE);
   }
}

   public void assertSomething() {
      Assert.assertTrue(Boolean.TRUE);
   }
}
Actually, if I add a test method to the ConcreteTestCase, it will run the tests. Not sure why this wasn't working before.

Move to JDT/UI
This got fixed in 3.3
