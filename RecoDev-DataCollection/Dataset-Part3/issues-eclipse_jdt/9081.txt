In the Java editor.
My file contained the line
    import java.util.*;

When I received a red x on a line for StringTokenizer I had initially assumed 
it was because I forgot its import so I chose "add import".

It added the line
     import java.util.StringTokenizer;

Thus making my imports be

    import java.util.*;
    import java.util.StringTokenizer;
