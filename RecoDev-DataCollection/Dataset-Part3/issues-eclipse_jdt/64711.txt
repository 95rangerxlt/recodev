When highlighting a java file in the package explorer, right-clicking and
choosing "Refactor -> Rename" the preview and ok buttons are always disabled
(regardless of the options selected). All you can do is cancel.

Sorry .. I'm a newbie with Eclipse and just realized after submitting that it
was because I didn't provide a different name that the buttons were disabled. 
UGH. So sorry.
