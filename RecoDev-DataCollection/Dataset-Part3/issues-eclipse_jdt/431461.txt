A year ago I stumbled upon a bug in JDT, analyzed it and filed an issue at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=414285 I believed the solution to be trivial but did not dare to try fixing the bug because I could not build and test my solution. When I saw that this bug was removed from Eclipse 4.4 plans, I tried again and after about an hour managed to submit a patch to gerrit. However, I'm still unable to build and verify the patch.

There are two contributor guides I've found so far:
 - http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Developers
 - https://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_Core_Committer_FAQ
 - http://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng

The first one starts with a suggestion to connect to CVS which is plain pathetic. The second one is somewhat useful, but suggests to directly clone eclipse.jdt.*.git repos which won't work since all pom.xml:s contain ../eclipse-platform-parent reference. I'm now trying to follow instructions at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform-releng/Platform_Build#Build_environment_setup and will see how they would work out. However, I'm still not sure if it is possible to build Eclipse outside eclipse.org build servers without spending a lot of time on tweaking environment and writing scripts.

All-in-all, I've now spent several hours searching for information and testing different approaches. I believe this is too much for an average person to even bother contributing to JDT, which means the project looses would-be contributors. A proper contributor guide should answer all the questions above, and make it easier to contribute to JDT Debug. I think a common guide for Platform + JDT + PDE would also make sense but since my problem was specific to JDT debug, I file it here.

For inspiration see these guides:

 - http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide
 - http://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Compare/Contributor_Guide
 - http://wiki.eclipse.org/GEF/Contributor_Guide

Thanks Mikhail for taking the time to remind me that this page is horribly out of date.

I re-wrote the page completely to include talk of Git, Gerrit, testing, conventions, etc.

https://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Developers

If you still think there is anything missing from the page to help contributors, feel free to add it in, or send me a note.
That's amazing, thank you a lot Michael!

I've skimmed through the guide and it looks fine. I've got one question though. The guide states that "debug projects are set up to compile against your installed Eclipse plug-ins". I usually run the latest stable release, but I am not sure if it is supposed to work well in this scenario. Does one need to run the latest milestone or integration build instead or is the latest release OK?

I guess the wording there is not so good. Basically it is saying that the debug plugins will work fine in your workspace without you having to import all their depenedencies (those come from the plugins installed in and part of the Eclipse version you are using).

I updated the wording to (hopefully) make more sense.

Thanks again Mikhail!
