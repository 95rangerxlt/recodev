There are two preferences for what appears at the start of a file:

Java > Editor > Templates > "filecomment"
Java > Code Style > Code Templates > Code > New Java files

This is fine - the first is just for the initial comment, and the second provides a template for other parts of the file as well.  However, it would be nice to link these two to avoid having to update the file comment in two places.  If I update the "New java files" template to be:

${filecomment}
${package_declaration}

/**
 * 
 */
${type_declaration}

It does *not* pick up the value of the filecomment template when I create a new file.  This leads to the error prone condition of having to specify the file comment template in two places.

Java > Editor > Templates > "filecomment" is gone since 3.0. You probably still have this because you use an old workspace. Simply remove it from the template list.

Even when I remove the "filecomment" template, it still appears in the list of variables on the code style preference page.  If it is gone, why is it still a variable option (that seems to insert nothing)?
Of course. The 'filecomment' code template is
Code Templates > Comments > File
How could a new user understand that association? (I didn't)  It must be even more confusing when the strings in "Code Templates > Comments > Files" get translated but the variable name is still called "filecomment". The description of the variable is recursive which doesn't give any clues:

filecomment - Content of code template "filecomment"

Perhaps it should be:

filecomment - Content of the Comments > Files code template

Or maybe the name of the variable it represents should appear somewhere on the screen next to the place where it is defined:

+ Comments
   + Files ("filecomment" variable)
   + Types ("typecomment" variable)
etc...


Martin, this makes sense to me.
