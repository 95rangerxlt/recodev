3.3 M3

Currently, the Java editor uses its own CompilationUnitAnnotationModel which inherits from ResourceMarkerAnnotationModel. This annotation model has no connection to the annotation model of the underlying file buffer.

This makes it hard to populate a Java editor with annotations that need to be updated on document changes. Ideally, this should be possible to set up during file buffer creating and disposal events.

We should investigate whether the CompilationUnitAnnotationModel could delegate to the file buffer annotation model rather than inherit from a resource marker annotation model.

Patch showing where to connect the two models

This patch shows where the two models would be connected. This however can't be committed because both models are resource marker annotation models and hence this would result in each annotation being there twice and each marker delta for its resource being processed twice.

Yes, this works for me. The annotations added to the TextFileBuffers annotation model are shown in the Editor.
