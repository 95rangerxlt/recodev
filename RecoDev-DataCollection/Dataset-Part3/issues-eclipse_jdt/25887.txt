Build 20021105

Profiling the time it takes to open a Java editor, I found out that almost 80% 
of the time is spent in JavaTextHover.setEditor(). And almost all of this time 
is spent sorting IConfigarationElements.

Can this be improved?

OptimizeIt trace of the time spent to open an editor
We can try to
- lazy load the hovers
- ensure that sorting is done only once since the contributions can not change
- improve the algorithm

I've seen option2 at work, and it does work fine.

How / which build?

I guess you see another improvement: the descriptions itself are no longer read
in more than once but they are still unnecessarily sorted. I think of improving
this too.

Descriptors are now cached too.


I meant, I saw it at work using a local patch made by Jerome. Nothing official.
