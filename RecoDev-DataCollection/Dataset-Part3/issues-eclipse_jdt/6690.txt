Build 20011206

CodeAssist provides type completions outside the classpath of a given project 
as soon as this project prereqs other projects. You will get types defined in 
prereqs of these prereq projects.

e.g. Create on project P prerequisiting org.eclipse.jdt.core, it will 
automatically have access to IResource, even though it is not on the classpath 
of P.

Fixed by creating (in SearchableEnvironment) a search scope including all 
package fragment roots of the project instead of the project and its required 
projects.
