M6 Test candidate:

Project property pages for code style and compiler settings should always show 
the link to configure the workspace settings, even if project specific 
settings are enabled. In this case, the link should simply be disabled (grayed 
out)

Martin, comments ? 
I think the current solution is good as the UI is not overloaded. What's the
advantage of a disabled link, Tobias?
Dirk, your opinion?
Hiding widgets seems not suitable, since the user has no clue that a certain 
function is available. If the widget is grayed out however, it is clear that 
the function is not applicable in this state, but generally available
A general UI guideline is to diabled UI elements instead of not showing them.
Seems to be adddressed.
