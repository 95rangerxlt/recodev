When I type code that has string literals in it, and press enter to move the 
string literal to the next line, the tab logic seems strange.

e.g. 
		String twoLines = 
			"System Contains Many Defects,Systemet innehåller många 
fel\n"+"Stories Are Too Complicated,Stories är för komplicerade";

Move the cursor after + and press enter.
It somehow moves the new line to column 0, while I'd expect it to align with 
the first line. If you try this with a single string, the bug will still be 
seen.
 
Interestingly, when I am within a method's parantheses, the behavior is 
different.

e.g. 
   assertEquals(
       "converted data",
       "Systemet+innehåller+många+fel|Stories+är+för+komplicerade",convertedData
.toString()
   );

Note, the two lines within have a single tab each. Now position the cursor on 
convertedData and press enter - while I'd expect it to line up with the 
previous line (two tabs), the IDE adds three tabs.

Now here's the one which really annoys me:

   assertEquals(

There is one tab before assertEquals.
Press enter after the paranthesis. Three tabs are inexplicably put in. I would 
expect only two.

I am assuming these are bugs as previous releases had the right behavior.

Tom, I guess this problem will be gone when we use the (new) formatter
(preferences) to do the auto-indenting.

@ comment 1: not sure whether the formatting will ever be done by the new
formatter since it would possibly mess up the line breaks.

The first issue mentioned is a dup of bug 46518 (no indentation after operators).

The other issues (wrong parameter indentation a double indentation in parameter
lists) are open and should be fixed, if possible for M5.
