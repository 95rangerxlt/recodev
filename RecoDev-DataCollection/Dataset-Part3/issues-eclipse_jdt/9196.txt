Set Workbench preferences reuse threshold to 1.

Open a hierarchy perspective with a hierarchy of 3 or more classes.
Open one Type by double clicking in the hierarchy.  Notice that type is 
selected in the hierarchy view, and its members visible.
Open another Type by double-clicking in the hierarchy.  The previous type gets 
re-selected after the new type was selected and opened.  Members are displayed 
for the wrong type, not the type that is open.
