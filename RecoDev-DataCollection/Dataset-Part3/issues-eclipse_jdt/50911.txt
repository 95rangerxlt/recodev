I20040128 (5pm)
-> New search view turned on

The "search" context menu doesn't appear on selections in the search results
view. I use this frequently for back-tracing when browsing code.  Search for
references to a method, and then search for references to the referencing
method, etc.  Ctrl+Shift+G to search on a selection in the search results view
also used to work.

Thomas, you have to retarget all the actions otherwise the key bindings won't work.

These are two different issues:

1) The context menu does not appear (no idea why, it should).
2) ctrl-shift-g doesn't work (likely the retargeting problem).
I cannot reproduce the missing context menu with the 2003-01-29 build. John, can
you give a more precise scenario? Do you never get the context menu or just
sometimes?
I am now seeing the context menus in I20040129. It is possible I couldn't find
it because I was looking for "Search" sub-menu, and it has changed to
"References" and "Declarations".  Ctrl+Shift+g is still not working though.
Added code to call retargeting in the search action groups.
