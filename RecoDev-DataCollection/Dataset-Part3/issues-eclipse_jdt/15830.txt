I love this feature! It would be even better if the first page of the dialog
allowed selection of visibility. It is very common to create public
getters/setters for private or protected fields. It's a little tedious to have
to manually change this every time. Plus, visibility can (or could) affect how
much code needs to be changed. It would be better to get it right the first time.

makes sense, but we are close to the 2.0 freeze and it might not make it in.
Fixed in build > I20020514
Verified.
