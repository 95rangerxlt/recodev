After moving the class com.objfac.xmleditor.XMLValidator to the package
com.objfac.xmleditor.actions, a referencing class was left with the following
import statements:

import com.objfac.xmleditor.XMLValidator.ErrorCallback;
import com.objfac.xmleditor.XMLValidator.LocatorInfo;
import com.objfac.xmleditor.actions.XMLValidator;

The class itself is correctly named, but its two inner classes are not. (All of
these imports were originally added by Organize Imports.)

Forgot to mention, Eclipse 2.0, Win2K
reproduced - will investigate
to make the test case easier to read:
package p;
public class Outer {
    public class Inner1{}
    public class Inner2{}
}
package test;

import p.Outer;
import p.Outer.Inner1;
import p.Outer.Inner2;

public class Test {
    Inner1 s;
    Inner2 i;
    Outer v;
}


after moving Outer to p1:
package test;

import p.Outer.Inner1; <<INCORRECT
import p.Outer.Inner2; <<INCORRECT
import p1.Outer;

public class Test {
    Inner1 s;
    Inner2 i;
    Outer v;
}

fixed
test added - all green now
