I would like there to be a template variable, for example "filename", that 
works like the "file" variable, except the variable's value doesn't contain 
the file extension.  This would allow me to create template such as the 
following:

public final class ${filename} extends TestCase {
    public static Test suite() {
        final TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(${filename}.class);
        ...
    }

...

}

Martin, can you please comment.
Suggest to call it ${primary_type_name}.
To be added to the editor variables.
(see CompilationUnitContextType.File: this is the existing ${file} variable)
