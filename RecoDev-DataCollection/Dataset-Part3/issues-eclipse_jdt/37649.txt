array initializers of form
Object[] stuff= {element0, ... , elementN};

can be changed to
Object[] stuff= new Object[]{element0, ... , elementN};

this is imporant as a step before inline temp, for example:
{...} cannot be inlined, but new Object[]{...} can
(we could make inline temp hanldle this but a quick assist would be very cool 
here as well)

it can be done the other way as well (in some cases)
