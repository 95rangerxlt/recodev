Proposed Patch
Released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=1534c3fb9312be746c807d9f0aa370d7a2598284
I now have test failures when running with a 1.6 JRE, e.g. GenericTypeTest#test0809().

Looks like the problem is that e.g. ITERATOR_IMPL_JRE8 is used inside a class declaration (and not only at the very end, like most other such constants).

A one-time fix could be to add more "\n" in the "else" branch of AbstractRegressionTest. But to fix this bug once and for all, please make the initialization future-proof: Instead of "if (IS_JRE_8) {...} else {...}", just have a series of initialization statements like this:

    COMPARATOR_IMPL_JRE8 = initImplJre8(
            "   public ...");

Then, initImplJre8 can either return the passed declaration or, if we're not running 1.8, return a string with the right number of "\n" characters.


And please clean up the whitespace characters and indentation. Indent lines with Ctrl+I, and also make sure all whitespace between '"' and 'public' inside the strings are formatted the same (just 1 tab). Unnecessary irregularities tend to pile up and cause maintenance nightmares, so we should just not create them.

Eclipse usage tips to avoid such problems:
- enable Show Whitespace Characters in the toolbar or via Text Editor prefs page
- "Shortcuts for manipulating lines" here: http://help.eclipse.org/juno/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tips/platform_tips.html#Editing

Proposed patch for the rework suggested in comment 3

Additional patch for the white space correction and the GTT:0809 failure - used one time fix for now.
Resolved.
