Build 20020425.3

- load AboutDialog from JUnit. 
- organize imports

observe: missing import Dialog
Resolving the simple name 'Dialog' resolves in a TypeBinding to 
name= "junit.awtui.AboutDialog"

20020425.JDTCore.04.30

	public void foo() throws IOException {
	}

IOExpception is resolved as method reference


This code looks wrong: DefaultBindingResolver.resolveName

		ASTNode parent = name.getParent();
		if (parent instanceof MethodDeclaration) {
			return this.resolveMethod((MethodDeclaration)parent);
		}
		if (parent instanceof TypeDeclaration) {
			return this.resolveType((TypeDeclaration)parent);
		}
<< should also test if name.equals((MethodDeclaration) parent).getName())
Fixed and released in HEAD. Now Organize imports returns:
import java.awt.Button;
import 
java.awt.Dialog;
import java.awt.Font;
import java.awt.Frame;
import 
java.awt.GridBagConstraints;
import java.awt.GridBagLayout;
import 
java.awt.Insets;
import java.awt.Label;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import 
java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter;
import 
java.awt.event.WindowEvent;

for the class junit.awtui.AboutDialog. The IOException in 
a throws clause is now returned as a ITypeBinding.
is this in 20020430?
I guess so. I didn't see the drop done yet, so it should be included in the today's drop.
