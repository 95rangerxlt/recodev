When I pass not defined variable as method call parameter Eclipse offers me
quick fix but created variable type will be java.lang.Object even if only one
matching method exists and variable type is predictable.

please provide an code example. This should work.
For constructor call:

BufferedOutputStream bufferedOutputStream = new BufferedOutputStream(test);

and choose quickfix create local var test. It will create 
Object test;

For method call:
 bufferedOutputStream.wait(time);

and again var time will be Object type although in both cases only single
constructor/method matches.
