20020409-I on Linux-Motif and w2k:

  1. Setup JUnit
  2. Enable option 'Code Generator->Remove prefix from field names'
  3. Open TestCase.java
  4. In the outliner, right click on 'fName'.
  5. Observe: No context menu is shown, instead, it asks me right away
     if I want to delete the getter/setter as well.
