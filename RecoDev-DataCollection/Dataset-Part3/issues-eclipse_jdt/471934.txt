As a continuation of bug #458043 and bug #463070, etc

Please don't define maven-antrun-plugin version but rely on the version defined in the parent pom's "pluginManagement" section.

Please also drop the dependencies specified under maven-antrun-plugin -- this build does not actually need or use them.

Mat,
I understand the removal of ant dependency from pom.xml. I am not very clear about removal of rhino and bfs as I could not find an entry in parent pom for these.
Can you please explain, how it works ?
Thanks.

Hi Sarika,

These dependencies can be removed entirely -- rhino and bsf are to support javascript inside your ant scripts, but you do not make use of this. I assume this was just copy/pasted from SWT where they actually need it.

Thanks Mat for the contribution and explanation.
