I have 2 working sets
 1) the projects I am actively working on
 2) a main project I am using classes that also has examples

There are several times (especially when learning to use a new part of a 
library) when it is useful to actually search across both working sets.
However the dialog for picking the working set, only lets you search across one 
working set. 

Note: I realize I can work around this by creating a super working set holding 
both.

Aside: Search in working set is a really good feature. (thx)

Should not be a big deal to enhance.
Probably not for M3 but good chance for 2.0
Consider when switching to Platform UI implementation of working sets which will
be provided with M5.
Still a time-permitting item.
