The following description is from a Japanese tester working on build F2.  She 
has tried looking for the string where "Externalize Strings in <source file 
name>" would be built and has been unable to find it, as have I.  Her problem 
is that in Japanese the title needs to read in a different order than it does.  
Unless she can change the order, it just won't make sense in Japanese.  Could 
we either be told where to find the proper key to switch the order, or have one 
made if it doesn't exist? I will also attach a screencap.

This bug opened in response to TPRS ID=112



From the Java perspective, expand the com.ibm.wsweducation.dialogs package to 
expose DialogsPlugin.java in the Packages view. Double-click DialogsPlugin.java 
to edit it if it is not already open for editing. Make another change, but do 
not save the file. In the Packages view, select the 
com.ibm.wsweducation.dialogs project or package. On the menu bar, click on 
Source -> Find Strings to Externalize... Select the DialogsPlugin.java file and 
click on Externalize... Then Click on OK. 'Externalize Strings' opens.

Title of this window is 'Externalize Strings in 'DialogsPlugin.java'.
I found 'in' in NLSUIMessage.properties file, but even if I translate it, word 
order is incorrect for Japanese. In this case, order should be:
'DialogsPlugin.jave' 'in' 'Externalize Strings'
in Japanese.
We need complete sentence with variables.
