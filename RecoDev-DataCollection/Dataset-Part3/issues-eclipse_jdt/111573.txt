bug 33550 explains the new support from platform for storing/restoring dialog
size/positions

Se should probably support to store size in all dialogs our that have resize
enabled.
At the same time we should look that resize is supported by all dialogs that
contain some UI.

I made a pass for 3.2 and added this for the dialogs we thought it makes sense. If  you feel we missed an important dialog, please reopen or file a new bug.
Martin, I think you mean "3.3"...may want to change the milestone so you won't lose this one for verification.
I meant 3.2. I did that some month ago and forgot to update the bug report.
