Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a file with the following classes:

public class A
{
    void X(int p1, int p2)
    {
    }
}

class B extends A
{
    void Y()
    {
    	super.X(1, 2);
    }
}

2. Run the "Pull Up" refactoring on Y with the default options.
3. Click on the "Finish" button.

Expected Output:
Move Y to class A and change super.X(1, 2) to X(1, 2), as below:

public class A
{
    void X(int p1, int p2)
    {
    }
    
    void Y()
    {
    	X(1, 2);
    }
}

class B extends A
{
}

Actual Output:
Shows error message in a message box:
"An unexpected exception occurred while performing the refactoring. See the error log for more details.\n\nStart node is not a original child of the given list"

Note: X must have at least two parameters for the bug to appear. Also, if the user clicks on the "Next" buttons instead of "Finish", the following error appears in a third screen of the refactoring window: "An unexpected exception occurred while creating a change object. See the error log for more details."
