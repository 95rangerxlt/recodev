The properties file approach tried to insert new key/value pairs according to
some sort order. The new approach seems to simply adding the fields at the end. 

Sorting the fields by name would improve the readability of the file.

New fields are added sorted into the *Message.java file. 

This does not fix Bug 94958 which is IMHO not a dup (if there are no fields yet in the *Message.java file then the new field is still inserted at the end and does not honor the member sort order)

This does also not change anything for Bug 107308 because there the problem is that the *.properties file is sorted, which does work with the traditional NLS style as well as with the eclipse style.

1. New fields for existing NLS files are inserted in alphabetical order (handles also renames, see also Bug 131288).

2. The members of new generated NLS files are inserted in the order as defined by the member sort order (for traditional as well as for eclipse style nls mechanism). Exception is the BUNDLE_NAME field, which is always the first member of the class.
