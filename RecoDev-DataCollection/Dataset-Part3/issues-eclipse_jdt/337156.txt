package xy;
class Bug {
    void foo() {
        set
    }
    
    void setAnswer(boolean answer, int n) { }
    boolean getAnswer() {
        return true;
    }
}


- Have "Java Editor > Content Assist > Insert best guessed arguments" selected and "Java Editor > Typing > Auto-insert Semicolon" unchecked

- invoke content assist after "set"
- press Enter to accept first proposal
- press End
- press ;
=> line is "setAnswer(;|, 0)" where | is the caret

Expected: Semicolon should be inserted at end of line where the caret was.

Fix

Dani please speak up if you don't like the fix.

I've removed an "if (key == ';')" check in the language-agnostic CompletionProposalPopup2 that was there for no good reason, and I changed the additional trigger character in ParameterGuesser from ';' to ',', which also fixes bug 154740.

Fix

+1 for the fix.
Fixed in HEAD.
Actually, the fix breaks an important scenario:
1. take example from comment 0 and remove the second argument from setAnswer
2. code complete after "set"
3. press ';'
==> semicolon replaces the selection instead of adding it at the end.

Yeah, that's what you used to get for free, but it's actually another scenario that was broken. With "Auto-insert Semicolon" unchecked, typing ";" should just mean "replace the selection with a ;". And that's what we do in HEAD.

To get the semicolon at the end, you need to enable the preference.

Indeed. I'm so used that the semicolon is auto-inserted that I forgot about this in my new test workspace.
