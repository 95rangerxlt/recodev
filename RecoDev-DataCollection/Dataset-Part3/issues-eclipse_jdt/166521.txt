Smart Paste into string should not escape single ticks ('), since escaping them is not necessary. Likewise for pasting " into a char literal.

Proof: This program prints truetrue:

public class Try {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("''{0}''" == "\'\'{0}\'\'");
        System.out.print('"' == '\"');
    }
}

Bug 74235 requests to make escape characters configurable, but I think that's not necessary any more if this bug is fixed.

Fix

I would also close bug 74235. JdtTextTestSuite says green.

I meant the suite *stays* green with this 3-line patch.
*** Bug 74235 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Thanks for the patch.

Fixed in HEAD along with fixing the bogus preference dependency to wrapping.

After that bug 209976 remains.
