Stephan, please follow up, TIA
Root cause: annotations on PQTR were resolved too early: this.resolvedType needs to
be initialized so that Annotation.resolveType() can update the resolved type's tagBits.

Simply swapping statements fixed the issue with one side effect:
If an annotation is both syntactically illegal and unresolved, only the former
error is reported. See changes in GrammarCoverageTests308.test039().

I think this is a good change actually, LMK if you think differently.
