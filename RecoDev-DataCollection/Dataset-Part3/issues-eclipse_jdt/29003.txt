In the window/preferences/Java/New Project panel, when 'Folders' radio button 
is set, the 'output folder name' cannot be set to something like 'WEB-
INF/classes'.
The error message "'/' is an invalid character" appears.

However, when setting the output path on the project (project/properties), 'WEB-
INF/classes' is allowed, as the '/' is valid.

Please change the window/preferences to allow a '/' in output folder name, so 
this value can be set by default.
