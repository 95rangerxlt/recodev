Open "Externalize Strings" wizard
-> Click on "Configure"
-> Delete class name for accessor class
-> error shows up saying 'Type name " is not a valid identifier.'
-> Type in a valid class name

Problem:  Error is still there and does not allow you to finish unless you click
on "Browse" and find that class or do something else to the wizard

Expected:  On modification of the class name, validator should kick in.  :-)

Note:  This also happens for Property File Name field.  Other field may be
affected but these are the ones I noticed :)
