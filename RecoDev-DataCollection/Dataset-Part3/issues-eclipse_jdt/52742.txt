If I add an existing directory as a project to eclipse, it correctly determines
what all the source folders in that directory are, and adds them as source
folders to my java build path.

However, it adds them in some strange ordering (filesystem ordering perhaps?)
and so if you have a lot of them, it is hard to visually scan them for what you
want.  It would be nice if instead when it created the project, it arranged all
the source folders in alphabetical order.

I can do this manually by sorting the .classpath file, but it seems like
something that should be done to improve the user experience for people that are
trying to use eclipse with existing filesystem layouts.
