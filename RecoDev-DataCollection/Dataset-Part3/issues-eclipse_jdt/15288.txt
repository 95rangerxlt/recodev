JUnit setup
1) create a new class Foo in the default package
2) add a package declaration:
      package foo; (notice that the package foo does not exist)
3) save and build
   An error highlight the package declaration
      (filed a separate bug that the mismatching package is not reported during
       reconciling)

The move proposal triggers a move delta, which is detected by the editor and 
posted in async exec to do the input change.
When selecting an entry with douple click, hiding the dialog gives back focus 
to the editor, which then sees the input not existing anymore, and brings up 
the dialog.
Fixed by changing content assist to first hide the selection dialog, then 
applying the proposal.
