Verifying build I20080226-1155, it looks like some open editors tests are seriously red:
 - OpenJavaEditorTest#testOpenEditor3(): between -16.1% and -36%
 - OpenJavaEditorTest#testOpenEditor4(): between -18.1% and -39.2%

Verifying build I20080226-1155, it looks like some open editors tests are seriously red:

 - OpenJavaEditorTest#testOpenEditor4(): between -18.1% and -39.2%
Open Java and Text editor test regressions are caused by:

- bug 232499: Slower image painting due to fix for bug 224422 and bug 219432
- bug 232489: [Contributions] Switching editors updates TooItems updated due to
              calls to org.eclipse.ui.menus.CommandContributionItem.updateIcons()
- bug 232513: [Commands] *Authority classes taking up more time than they did in 
              3.3

I've added a degradation comment. Marking as FIXED since all I can do here has been done.
