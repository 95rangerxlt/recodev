Select a .java file in the Package Explorer and then Delete from its context 
menu.  A Confirm Delete windows appears saying, "Are you sure you want to delete 
the selected element(s)? Yes or No.  If you try the same thing from the 
Navigator view, a Confirm Resource Delete window appears saying, "Are you sure 
you want to delete 'xxx.java'?  Yes or No.

Likewise, if you select multiple resources to delete,
you will get different behavior between the Package Explorer and
Navigator views.  For the former, the Confirm Delete window appears
saying, "Are you sure you want to delete the selected element(s)?" Yes or No.
For the latter, a Confirm Multiple Resource Delete window appears
saying, "Are you sure you want to delete these 3 resources?"  Yes or No.

So, the delete confirmation prompts that appear in the Packages Explorer view
aren't consistent with those in the Navigator view.
