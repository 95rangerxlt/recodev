More tests for org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests
I would prefer having test case names other than test0, test1, ... But I don't 
know what you have discussed with Martin regarding this issue.
The corner case selection in the test cases are good. I didn't release the 
patch yet because of the following problems"

I agree with Dirk about the test names. We should change them to something more 
descriptive. (I know that some of my (older) test cases have this problem as 
well)

Other things I saw:
- Created test code contains compilation errors: 'super()' misses the semicolon.
- In test10 - test14, the created type 'Test1' has a constructor 'A'. This 
seems to be wrong. But it's a valid test case anyways: But I would expect to 
have constructor created then. Trying this in the build, the wizard does create 
one. Strange. Can you look at that?

- The current tests test all 'StubUtility.getOverridableConstructors'. 
It would be important to also really test the full operation, say the end 
result of the created code: Are comments there, inserted at the right insert 
position, super call ommited (or not), are the parameters correct, have imports 
been added.
So why not replace the call to getOverridableConstructors with the call to the 
operation.
After that it is easy to compare the content of the CU with the expected.
Note that if you use preference settings in tests you can never assume they are 
set to defaults, other tests can change them. So always set them yourself (e.g. 
in 'setUp', even to the default values (includes the comment and code templates)

Randy, if you have some time left this week, I'd be very glad if could have a 
look at this.
How do you set the Code Generation preferences to a known state (including 
templates)? I don't see an example in the jdt.ui.tests
CodeTemplates.getCodeTemplate(CodeTemplates.METHODCOMMENT).setPattern("");

proposed enhancements.

The reason that tests 10-14 were passing even with the constructor being
created as TestA() instead of Test1() is that the CreateMethodOperation is
being too smart on us and changing the name of the method to Test1() from
TestA(). 

+ Fixed the super(); problem
+ Changed test names
+ Changed constructor names to Test1() from A() in latter test cases
+ Added code template setting
+ Added some basic checking for some default constructors created

proposed fix.

The last test should check against adding a new import statement; however it
does not appear that the import statement was added to the cu. Not sure why
this is...
mark as fixed. Tests are up and running
