open junit Assert class
hover over the 'assert' word in the following method (with ctrl pressed)
	static public void assert(String message, boolean condition) {
		if (!condition)
			fail(message);
	}

note that 'assert' stays blue even after you move the mouse somewhere else
(it does not seem to happen for any other word)
