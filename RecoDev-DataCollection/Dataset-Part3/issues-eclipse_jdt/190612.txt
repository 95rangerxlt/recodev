The implementation of JavaFileObject.openOutputStream() is //TODO in the IDE.  (The corresponding openWriter() method is correctly implemented.)  This needs to be fixed for 3.3.1.

proposed patch

At present the OutputStream presented by FileObjects returned from Filer.createResource() is implemented with a ByteArrayOutputStream under the covers, and we wrap a Writer around it when needed.  However, the JavaFileObjects returned by Filer.createSourceFile() were done the other way, with a Writer under the covers.  It's hard to turn a Writer into an OutputStream.

This proposed patch implements the JavaFileObjects in the same way as the FileObjects, using a ByteArrayOutputStream.  Common code (mostly unimplemented methods) between the Java output file object and the non-source output file object are factored out into a common base class.
Jess, please review for inclusion in 3.3.2 and HEAD.  

Note, a bunch of methods remain unimplemented in this patch; I want to fix those for 3.3.2 as well, but I'll put that in a separate patch for the sake of clarity.
Just need a copyright notice on IdeOutputFileObject. Otherwise, +1.
