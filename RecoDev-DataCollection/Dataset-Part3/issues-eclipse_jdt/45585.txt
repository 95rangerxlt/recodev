1) Add "BUG" to your Task Tags 
2) Comment the following code 
 
	case Level.DEBUG_INT : 
 
it will recognize "BUG" in "DEBUG" as a Task Tag.

Syntax highlighting is wrong. J Core does not report it as task tag.

Proposed Solution

The TaskTagRule unreads a word (e.g., DEBUG) that does not match a task tag and
returns an undefined token. The JavaCommentScanner then returns its default
comment token for the unmatched characters (e.g., DE). That allows the
TaskTagRule to match on a suffix of a word (e.g., BUG).

The patch changes this such that TaskTagRule returns a configurable default
token for an unmatched word. The default token is set by the JavaCommentScanner
to the default comment token.
Released patch.
