E.g. the shortcut to Comment out a block Ctrl-/, but Ctrl-\ works.  
 
Due to the keyboard (swedish) layout Ctrl-/ is actually Ctrl-Shift-7 and  
Ctrl-\ is Ctrl-AltGr-+. (I did try som obvious alternative interpretations with 
no effect). I also noted a Ctrl-Shift+/ which obviously makes assumption wrt 
keyboard layout. Ctrl-/ and Ctrl-Shift-/ are the same. 
 
Many interpuntation and most special characters require Shift or AltGr or both 
on non-US keyboards.

This has been fixed for M7.
