It would be nice if the Source->Comment action could be used to comment just 
the selected text instead of a whole line of text. For example, if a file 
contained the line

builderTable.setLayoutData(new GridData(GridData.FILL_BOTH));

and "GridData.FILL_BOTH" was the selected text, then using SOurce->Comment 
would add /* before the selected text and */ after it. If all the non-
whitespace text of a line was selected, the whole line would be commented in 
the usual way (by adding // to the beginning of the line).

This isn't an important feature, just something that might be useful 
occasionally.

not critical for 2.0 defer
Reopening for 2.1 consideration
this also makes sense if we have code like this and we want to comment only one 
catch block

try {
} catch (1) {
} catch (2) {
}
There are now "Add Block Comment" and "Remove Block Comment" menu items that provide this functionality.
