Using I20040505 WXP

If you have a method which overrides a super method, folding the code causes a 
swtich to the super class' method implementation.

For example, if I collapse or expand ArrayList.isEmpty(), I end up looking at 
List.isEmpty().  If I switch back to ArrayList, the method is collapsed.

Note that you have two vertical rules with two different icons if you click on
the left one which indicates that isEmpty implements a List.isEmpty() it
correctly jumps there. If you click on the icon on the right it will fold.

Correct, I am clicking on the right and it seems that the folding is occuring 
and the left seems to be grabbing the click as well since its jumping to the 
super class.
thanks for reopening. I didn't see it because I enabled annotation roll overs.

Must fix for 3.0.
