Our project uses a whole bunch of different libraries. With this we have two 
problems:

1. it makes it harder than necessary for new developers in our team to setup 
their Eclipse environment since they need to add each individual library 
manually
2. each time a jar file is upgraded, removed or added each developer has to 
adjust his/hers project's Java Build Path -> Libraries accordingly

Rejected solutions:

1. We cannot share .project and .classpath since our directory structure is 
not the exact same
2. Maven and the Maven plugin for Eclipse could do the job for us but a) as 
of now it's to big of a step to take b) the plugin is not fully functional 
and c) we have stuff that Maven currently does not handle

So, we came to think of using a User Library (Project Properties -> Java 
Build Path -> Libraries -> Add Library -> User Library) since it can be 
exported/imported. However, the absolute path is saved for the jar files in 
the User Library. I would like it to save the path relative to the project 
root instead, so that we can use the same User Library within our project (as only the project root directory changes).

Is this possible to change in some way?

As it was suggested in bug 70417 discussion, I'd like to request the reopening of this bug, but against JDT/UI instead of JDT/Core. As far as it seems until now, only the UI part is missing for this widely requested feature, so it should be "low hanging fruit" to solve it. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks in advance, Victor.
Reopening as requested
JDT/Core supports workspace relative jar file in user libraries.
JDT/UI would need to be changed to allow to select a workspace relative jar.
Moving to JDT/UI
fixed > 20071206

When you now select JARs inside the workbench the path will be stored relative so it can be shared.
