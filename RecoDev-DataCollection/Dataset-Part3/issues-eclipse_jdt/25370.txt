I added a new feature that starts the linked mode on all usages of a variable.
e.g.
int i;
i= 1;
i++;
 would link all 3 occurrences of i, so when edited, all 3 references are 
changed simultanously.

Problem is that the liked mode does not allow me to set the focus (where to 
edit) to e.g. the 'i' in 'i++'. The linked mode only allows to edit the top 
most linked position ('int i').
The feature can be invoked on any reference. Jumping to the top not so ideal.

The problem was that the caret could go off the document, which was causing 
problems for StyledText. Requires some experimenting and investigation.
*** Bug 26320 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
after a lot of experimenting and investigation later:
fixed >= 20021122

I applied the necessary change in the LinkedNamesAssistProposal
