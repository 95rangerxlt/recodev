Screen shot
The Working Set... currently appears before the MRU list. The three entries on
top of Working Set... aren't working sets. However, the user might not know the
difference.

We show the filter... in the package explorer's view menu at the end as well.
I would suggest to add a separator after 'hierarchy', then the working set
instances and then 'working set...' at the end. Dirk?

Right.  "Duh" on my part.

I think a separator to delimit the working set section would help.
However, I still think the 'Working Set...' item should go at the end, since
when I'm scanning it's like: "Is the one I want I want in the short list?  No,
then choose Working Set...".  Putting at the end would be consistent with other
places (New, Show View, Open Perspective).



+1 for the separator and Working Set... at the end.
> I still think the 'Working Set...' item should go at the end

Sorry, I see now that's exactly what you were proposing.
+1.
