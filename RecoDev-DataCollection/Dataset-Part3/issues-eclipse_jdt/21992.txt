Welcome to the SWT team Andre!
Thanks Steve!
Platform reality: Carbon doesn't provide means to control the color of the progress bar.
Suggest to enhance the JUnit so that it it displays the status color independent from the 
progress bar.
JUnit 3.8.1 has the same problem under Swing: the ProgressBar ignores calls to 
setBackground.
fixed - the view is now using custom progress indicator with red/green feedback.
