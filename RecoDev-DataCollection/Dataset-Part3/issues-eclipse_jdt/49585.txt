The generate getters/setters, generate constructor and override/implement
methods dialogs have a combo box for selecting the insertion point.
It would be nice to add an entry to this combo that would insert the generated
code at the cursor's position. This entry could be unavailable if the cursor is
not at a position that permits to insert the code, or the code could be inserted
at the nearest valid position.

Shouldn't this bug be marked as fixed?
Yes.
This doesn't work properly when there are inner classes. Eg.:

class A {
  private int x;

  | 

  public static class B {
  }
}

If I use "generate constructor using fields" at the specified cursor position (the "|" in the code above), the constructor is generated after the inner class.
Please file a new bug with build ID and steps to reproduce.
