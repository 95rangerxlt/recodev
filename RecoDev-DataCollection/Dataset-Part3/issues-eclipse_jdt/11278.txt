This is a very little glitch, but consistency is goodness :)
In the Java perspective, when you select "Compare With" at any level, the "Each 
Other" menu apppears at the top, while it appears at the bottom of the list in 
the Resource Navigator.

Yes yes, I know its silly, but this is a 2 second fix that has a big effect :)

ps: this is R1.0 build 137
