I've noticed that the Rebuild Project action issues on a Java project
does not compile some of my Java source files. This is happening in
Eclipse 20011219 (stable build).

I know it's not compiling them because (a) there are no error markers, 
and (b) there are no generated class files.

Its always the same two files (ASTTest and ASTVisitorTest), and the
only thing even remotely remarkable about them is that they occur
in the same package fragment as another file (ASTConverterTest) which
has a lot of errors due to missing imports. If I edit either file and
save the changed, the Build Project action does compile the changed file.

The build is failing because of an incomplete classpath.

Jeem does not have our latest changes which replaces all problems on the 
project with just two problems.

He should see one error on the project: "The project was not built since its 
classpath is incomplete."

The second error in on the file which indirectly references the missing class 
file.
