The description of an attributte appears if the mouse is in the same line of the
refering code, even if it's forward the code in an empty place.

I have the following code:
if (msg instanceof TransactionMessage)

If I put the mouse in the same line as the code, in an empty space in front, the
description of TransactionMessage appears.

I was rechecking my bugs and found this as been fixed in 17 Sep 2003 build
(maybe before, just checked it now)...

This bug should be marked FIXED.
