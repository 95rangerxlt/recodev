RC1

- enable warnings for unused methods
- add a (unused) private method xxx to a class
- open QF
Observe: the only quickfix listed is a very brief "remove".

Since "remove" is a potentially dangerous operation, it would be
good to explicitely state what gets removed, like "remove unused method" or
even better "remove unused method xxx".
