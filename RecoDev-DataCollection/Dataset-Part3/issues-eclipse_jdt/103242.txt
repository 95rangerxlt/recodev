It would be nice to have the option to keep more than just the last run of junit.

An arbitrary number would be ideal, but even two would be wonderful. (More
wonderful that is - it's already very wonderful.)

I ask, because I sometime have more than one test fail.  (I know I should write
better tests, such is life.)  What I would like to be able to do is rerun one of
the failed tests, then return to the entire list of tests and rerun the next
failed test and so on.

David, are you considering this for the JUnit enhancements you are working on ?
It's not in the two-week plan, but it's first up in the triage list I made up a
couple days ago.  We already do this in continuous testing, so it should be only
moderately difficult.
this is an extremely painful limitation

In 3.2 the JUnit history got added.
