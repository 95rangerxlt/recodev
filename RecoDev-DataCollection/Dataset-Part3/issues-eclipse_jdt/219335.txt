Package Explorer view has an implicit rule that hides all empty classpath containers and jar folders like "Referenced Libraries". This rule is interfering with tools like Mylyn that applies its own task-focused filtering and even non-empty "Referenced Libraries" folder isn't shown when Mylyn filtering is on.

One way to address this issue would be to replace implicit rule for "Referenced Libraries" and other empty classpath folders with an explicit filter. That filter will be visible in view menu / Filters... and also can be disabled/enabled by Mylyn using filter API.

patch
Dani, can you review?
Patch looks is good. Maybe we could now always show the 'Referenced Libraries' node.

additional patch

Additional patch to show always add the 'References libraries' node, also if project has no libraries. The filter will decide if it is shown or not.
