The JDT new wizards all have an extra tag "javatype" which does not follow the 
schema from org.eclipse.ui.newWizards.

If this is useful to you we should consider adding an "args" tag to the new 
wizards for general use.

Martin, can you please comment. Having a generic args tag would work for us as 
well.
The runtime does have a generic args mechanism.  See IExecutableExtension.
But be aware of bug 48164.
