This is a request for support of CamelCase notation on the test selection dialog (which opens from the JUnit launch configuration's main tab). It is supported is most JDT dialogs, should be supported there too.

works in 3.2
Martin, what version should I pick to see this? I am using Eclipse 3.2 RC5 and it does not work for me (the Test Selection dialog does not give any clue it supports camel case either). Was this feature added later?
