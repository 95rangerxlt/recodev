There is a new template wizard at Preferences - Java - Template that allows the 
user to make thier own template. Due to fact that some internal labels are 
translated, the user cannot create template properly nor work in an editor.  
This bug was introduced at a web site in Japan as internationalization error of 
eclipse 2.0.  The problem should be fixed for release 2.1

The following file has key lines that should not be translated.  There should 
be a comment or something to mark that the following lines are not to be 
translated.

In the file JavaTemplateMessages.properties at plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.ui\
jdt_jar\org\eclipse\jdt\internal\corext\template\java

The 10 lines that should not be externalized are:
GlobalVariables.variable.name.cursor=cursor
GlobalVariables.variable.name.dollar=dollar
GlobalVariables.variable.name.date=date
GlobalVariables.variable.name.time=time
GlobalVariables.variable.name.user=user
CompilationUnitContextType.variable.name.file=file
JavaContextType.variable.name.array=array
JavaContextType.variable.name.index=index
JavaContextType.variable.name.collection=collection
JavaContextType.variable.name.iterator=iterator

This got already addressed for 2.1
