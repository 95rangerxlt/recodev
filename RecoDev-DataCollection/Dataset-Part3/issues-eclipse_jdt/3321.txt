1. Create Java project with no source folder
	2. Change .classpath as follows:
[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
    <classpathentry kind="var" path="JRE_LIB" rootpath="JRE_SRCROOT" sourcepath="JRE_SRC"/>
    <classpathentry kind="src" path="src"/>
    <classpathentry kind="output" path="bin"/>
</classpath>]
	Observe: The project has a warning saying that the folder src is missing as expected.
	3. In the navigator, create folder src
	Observe: The warning is still showing.
