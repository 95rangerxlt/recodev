Version: 3.2.0
Build id: I20051220-0800

There are tree possibilities in jdt/ui to manipulate the build path:
1. New java project wizard
2. Build path context menu in package explorer
3. Build path properties page for java project

1. and 2. share code but 3. does not share any code with 1. and 2.
The code for 1. and 2. is very complex wheras 3 is not as flexible. 

The goal is to simplify the code for 1. and 2. and to share it with 3. Another goal is to make the UI look nicer (i.e. no progress bar poping up under the dialog when executing build path action from the build path menu, use wizards instead of ugly dialogs) A third goal is to make the UI look uniform meaning that same or similar manipulations should look the same or similar in the UI.
