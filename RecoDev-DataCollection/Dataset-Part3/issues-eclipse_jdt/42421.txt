The following class shows it before and after I used "Source" - "Format"
(using Ctrl+Shift+F has the same effect).

The Java codeformatter preferences are set so that spaces are used instead
of tabs. The tabs are 4 spaces. Also, "Insert a newline inside an empty block"
is checked.
In the Java Editor Typing settings I also checked that spaces are used
instead of tabs.

The problem shown below is even worse for the real Java source code I am
writing: Whole lines of declarations have been folded into one line.


=== BEFORE "Source - Format" ===

/*
 * Created on Sep 2, 2003
 */

public class MyFormatTest {

    /**
     * Default Constructor 
     */
    public MyFormatTest() {
        super();
    }

    /**
     * Main Method
     * @param args not used
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}

=== AFTER "Source - Format" ===
/*
 * Created on Sep 2, 2003
 */public class MyFormatTest {/**
     * Default Constructor 
     */public MyFormatTest() {
    super();
}/**
     * Main Method
     * @param args not used
     */public static void main(String[] args) {
}
}
