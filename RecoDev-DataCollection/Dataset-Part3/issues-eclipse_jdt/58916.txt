If you have a sub-class which overrides a synchronized method in the superclass
(see example below), then only the "arrow" indicating the over-riding appears in
the Outline view. (not the "clock" for synchronizing as well)

Not sure if there is enough room to put both decorators in that space or not...

class A {
  synchronized void foo() {
  }
}
class B extends A {
  synchronized void foo() {
  }
}

We are looking into this but not clear if we can do anything here. This is in 
since 2.0.
Got fixed for 3.0. We are now showing a combined icon in this case.
