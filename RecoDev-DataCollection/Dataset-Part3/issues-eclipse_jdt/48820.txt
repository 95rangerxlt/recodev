When selecting multiple class files to move into a new package, and selecting
ALL refactoring options (changing references in docs, comments, and other files
(.xml in my case)) the reference update on all non-java elements is only
performed for the first file. The remaining ones are left as is, creating broken
links.

Example of how I'm using this:
Doing Web Application development with Struts. I've created a multitude of
Action classes, and when I go to move a handful of them and choose to update the
.xml files (struts-config.xml) only the first class moved gets its fully
qualified refernces updated in the struts-config.xml file.

If I perform each move independently, all works as expected.

This got already fix for the 3.0 stream.
