Now that (non-java) resources are available in the types view, I see squished 
icons. The attached picture shows what I mean.

I think what's happening is that the package.html's icon is 16x16, and it 
constrains all the other icons in the tree to 16x16, but the JDT icons want to 
be wider than 16 to add decorations ("F", "A", etc) to the side.

>Now that (non-java) resources are available in the types view
Who told you that? The Types view does not support resources.

Please provide steps to get resources into the Types view.

Could this be caused by some other exception (please check .log).

Nobody told me that. :-) I just saw the package.html in there and assumed that 
was the reason...

I'll investigate and report back.
The stuff I selected is in a Jar. That seems to be the condition. More 
expansive screenshot is attached. Happens 100% of the time, no error in the 
log.

The bug was introduced when NonJavaElementFilter was changed to handle closed
projects.

Fixed.
