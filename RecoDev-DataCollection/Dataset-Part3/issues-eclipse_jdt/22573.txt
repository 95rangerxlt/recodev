1. Open Type Hierarchy (1st time).
2. Click on the history toolbar button
3. Press "Remove" on the dialog
==> no way to enable "OK" 

It would be better not to allow to remove the actual type hierarchy.

You can press cancel.
I don't really see what the improvement would be of disabling 'Remove' instead. 
I'm sure there will be be other PR's that compain that Remove is disabled.
A dialog should allow me to go on with my work i.e. allow OK. Otherwise it's a
GUI blooper. You allow me to delete it and then add it again behind my back.
