to execute the most recently run tests again. In test suites with many test 
cases, running all tests to quickly verify whether previously made changes 
fixed the failing test cases can be quite time consuming.
A further action "Rerun Failed Tests" could improve the situation.

Agreed (CCing Martin since he is requesting this for a long time)

Rerunning failed tests only is "dangerous" since you can have broken other
tests. Therefore I'd prefer a test priorization approach, i.e., "Rerun Failed
Tests First". This will allow you to quickly find out whether you fixed a test,
but you will still run all tests. This is more in the spirit of JUnit.  

I'm working on code for test prioritization as part of
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=51292, with "Most Recent Failing
Tests" as a built-in prioritizer.
Hi David, I haven't forgotten it and I'm looking forward to your contribution.

ERich, can this be closed with the new feature you released ?
yes we can close this one. We have a separate bug to track a more general test
priorization solution that David is working on.
