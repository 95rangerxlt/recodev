Olivier, does the fix for 
http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9024
cover this one as well?

Please send the PR back to me if my assumption was wrong.

References to constants (Help is a static final int) cannot be found in 
binaries as they are inlined in the class files. We cannot do anything about 
this.
Now I understand.
But as a user I was left with the impression that there were no references not 
that it was not possible to to find them.
Thus I think this is a UI issue. 
please close or give prio..
The UI could inform the user about that fact.
Most likely not for 2.0


Reference Search via menus no longer available for binary primary constants.
