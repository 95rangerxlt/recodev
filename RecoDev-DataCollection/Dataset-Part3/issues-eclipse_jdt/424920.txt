Patch

Attached a patch which replaces PackageQualifiedType with NameQualifiedType in the BETA_JAVA8 branch to remove the compilation errors.
Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=a4e4a10b05d87e208100de0a8e7c789cfbdbdfad

I've properly sorted the visitor methods and fixed the semantic shift in ImportReferencesCollector#visit(NameQualifiedType).
