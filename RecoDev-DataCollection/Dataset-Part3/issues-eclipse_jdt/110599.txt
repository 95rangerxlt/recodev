The 'convert to enhanced for loop' quick assist removes comments before the
loop. It shouldn't.

	void m(String[] strings) {
		//comment stays
		
		//comment will be removed
		for (int i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
			System.out.println(strings[i]);
		}
		//comment stays
	}

The comment heuristic associates the comment with the for statement which is
replaces by a enhanced-for statement. Looks similar, but isn't.

Not trivial, so unless we get that complain more than once I suggest to close.
I was just about to enter a report for this.

This is very nasty when it happens in a cleanup - comments from all over your code just vanish
This bug makes the 'convert for loop to enhanced' feature completely unusable! So, treating this bug as 'RESOLVED REMIND', you can simply remove this feature at all.
Agree.
Benno, please check if this is still a problem in 3.3.
A fix could be to use TightSourceRangeComputer and to register the relevant node(s).
Sure, it's still an issue...
But I agree, it's less severe to keep a potential obsolete comment then removing a still useful comment.
