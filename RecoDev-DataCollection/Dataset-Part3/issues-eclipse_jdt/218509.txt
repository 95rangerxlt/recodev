In class JavaSpellingProblem, in the following line

postfix= fDocument.get(end + 1, line.getOffset() + line.getLength() - end);

I think, the addition of "+ 1" is not correct, it removes the char directly behind the word.

Can you provide steps to show the problem? See also:

I think, the bug in the code is obvious.

To reproduce:
Enable spell checking, open a text file in a simple text editor (not Java editor), type for example: 
  spellang(test)
Request quickfixes and look at the information of "change to 'spelling'":
  spellingtest)

Good catch Stephan! Actually the Java editor has a similar problem but in the opposite direction: the postfix is to long there.

Fixed in HEAD.
