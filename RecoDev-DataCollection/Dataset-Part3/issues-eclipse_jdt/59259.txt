Change the paramter order in the following example

	/**
	 * @param obj1 this is a longer comment that
	 *  splits over lines
	 * @param obj2 this is a longer comment that 
	 *  splits over lines
	 */
	public void foo(Object obj1, Object obj2) {
		
	}

produces:

	/**
	 * @param obj2 this is a longer comment that 
 *  splits over lines
	 * @param obj1 this is a longer comment that
 *  splits over lines
	 */
	public void foo(Object obj2, Object obj1) {
		
	}

This is an AstRewrite problem. I use AstRewrite#createMoveTarget(..) and then
insert the result into a ListRewrite.
See ChangeSignatureRefactoring rev. 1.79, lines 1605 and 1606 in
changeJavadocTags(). It seems as if the leading \t is missing.
fixed in I20040505
