Fix

All views with "Link with Editor" actions should support the new command from bug 79581.
For M5, unless bug 79581 goes into the new & noteworthy and would make us look bad.
What for are the 'XXX 's in the patch?
One is for the missing commandID constants in Platform/UI (bug 54581) and the others are a reminder for bug 212630: The code pattern ...

    IActionBars bars= getSite().getActionBars();
    IHandlerService service= (IHandlerService)
            bars.getServiceLocator().getService(IHandlerService.class);
    service.activateHandler(..);

... works and is also used by Platform/UI code, but there's currently no Javadoc that explicitly guarantees that the IHandlerService is always available (but it is, since IWorkbenchSite guarantees it and view action bars delegate to the view's service locator).

If Platform/UI does not add this guarantee, we would have to rewrite our code to use the viewSite directly.
Fixed in HEAD (with null checks for bug 212630).
