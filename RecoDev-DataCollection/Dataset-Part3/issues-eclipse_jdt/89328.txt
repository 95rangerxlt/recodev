Version: 3.1.0
Build id: I20050322-1757

The "Infer Generic Type Arguments" refactoring is showing on elements that it
shouldn't apply to, such as projects, jars and classes.  Just to see what would
happen i gave it a go anyway and it failed.  It seems to depend on what you run
it on as to where it fails and what exception you get (usually a null pointer).

Right click on a jar file in the package explorer, select Refactor|Infer Generic
Type Arguments.  Accet values in the dialog.  An exception should be logged.

Markus, the refactoring should be disabled on Jars and class folders.
