Build 3.2M5

Having the following source in Java editor, I noticed an unexpected bulb icon in the left ruler. It seems to imply a quickfix is available though none is actually.
(in 1.5 source mode)

public class X {
	void foo(Object... os) {}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new X().foo(args);
	}
}

I could reproduce this once, but the lightbulb did not show up again after close/reopen. Wild guess: could have something to do with canceled reconciles.
Martin, any idea?
No idea. Need a reproducable case. 
Hm, the problems seems to come from the caching in JavaAnnotationImageProvider::getImage. 

For every annotation, an image is requested for a certain type: one of { NO_IMAGE, GRAY_IMAGE, OVERLAY_IMAGE, QUICKFIX_IMAGE, QUICKFIX_ERROR_IMAGE }. The last returned image gets cached. While caching is ok for defined images (quick fixable etc.), it is not ok for the meta-types like OVERLAY_IMAGE, which will reentrantly call getManagedImage for the overlay annotation.
