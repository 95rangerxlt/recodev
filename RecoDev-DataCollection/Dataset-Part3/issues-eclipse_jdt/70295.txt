The following code is rejected by cheetah (from cvs as of few minutes ago) and
compiles by SUN JDK 1.5.0 beta3 b57. Cheetah error message: The method
isAssignableFrom(Class<?>) in the type Class<AssignableFrom> is not applicable
for the arguments (Class<? extends Object>)

=======================================
package test.cheetah;
public class AssignableFrom {
    void test(Object o) {
        AssignableFrom.class.isAssignableFrom(o.getClass());
    }
}
=======================================

PS: I was not purposely looking for bugs, I swear ;-)

Class<? extends Object> should be compatible with Class<?>.
Added regression test: GenericTypeTest#test250

Fixed
