The fix does not work if a tree shows multiple equal elements (e.g. same element in multiple working sets, or packages from a Jar).

Starting from SelectAllAction 1.9, you can either use
    fViewer.setSelection(fViewer.getSelection());
or
    fViewer.getControl().notifyListeners(SWT.Selection, new Event());
after both kinds of viewers.
The second form probably misses post selection changed events, so doing fViewer.setSelection(..) in all cases may be the safest choice.
The fix in I20061128-0800 is good.
