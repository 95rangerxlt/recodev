1. Window > Preferences > Java > Editor
2. Expand "Typing"

There are two Group controls with text inclusing an ellipsis:

   When pasting...
   In string literals...

The ellipsis [...] creates a strange visual effect beside the group line, since
it appears as if the line is broken.  As well, they are unnecessary and
inconsistent with the text used by other Groups.  I think they should be simply
removed from the strings.

We either need to find a good title for those sections or replace the "..." with ":"
Could not come up with good group titles. For now I've fixed this by using ": "
instead of "...".

Billy, good suggestions for the group titles are welcome ;-)
