Build 20020109

Whenever I quit and come back in, build causes my project to be totally rebuilt 
from scratch, even though it attempts to read the saved state.
I have seen this problem for quite a while.

I'm using a the self-hosting plugin, but it did this even before I had this 
setup.

I generally run with autobuild off.

I can supply my workspace if it helps.

This is a platform known issue, sometimes the platform will give us a null 
delta instead of an empty one, causing our builder to defensively perform a 
full build.
Nick, let us know if this still happens in 20020122.  There was a tree 
serialization problem that I believe is now fixed.
Seems to be fixed in 0123.
Closing PR.

Reopening, there seems to be an issue with the new builder, it does not succeed 
to read its own build state (using straight build 20020125) under some 
undetermined circumstances.

The scenario below occured after a fresh restart, sync'up with stream, grabbed 
a few changes, and hit ctrl-B.

PM's state.dat file is fine.

Adding more tracing in & around state reading.
Why is the project org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests being built before 
org.eclipse.jdt.core?

Are your project references correct?
Project references are now ok, and still these symptoms occur. Seems related to 
the fact that the built state cannot be read. 
Haven't yet reproduced it with the jdtcore 20020212.
Finally... I think this was always there!

public Object getLastBuiltState(IProject project, IProgressMonitor monitor) {
	PerProjectInfo info = getPerProjectInfo(project);
	Object state = info.savedState;
	if (state == null && !info.triedRead) {
		info.triedRead= true;
		try {
			state = readState(project); // DID NOT SET info.state
		} catch (CoreException e) {}
	}
	return state;
}

So the first request reads the saved state but if the requesting builder did 
not set it when the build was finished, the next request would answer null.

Since builders now ask for the build state of a prereq project, it will not be 
set & thus fail the next time its project was rebuilt.
