Build 3.1M2

Open the window -> preferences dialog
Choose Java -> Code Style -> Code Templates

Notice that there are now two buttons labelled identically "Import..." 
and "Export..."; one set for all preferences and one set for templates.

Apart from being a crime against usability and accessibility (it fools screen 
drivers) it makes for interesting documentation ('click the Import button on 
the left, not the one on the right).  :-(

Reopen. Wrong duplicate.
I'm disappointed that you consider this accessibility bug minor, considering 
it can be fixed with a trivial button label change.

I'm updating the title appropriately.
Changing the severity was the wrong thing to do. However given that we still
have serious bugs with J2SE 5.0 support this one isn't top on our list.
I'll take this as a point to the preferences dynamic team discussions.
The reason for having two buttons was that the global import/export is too weak;
we're working on that 
Martin can you take care of this now that Platform/UI works on the new
import/export wizard.
This got addressed with the new import/export wizard.
