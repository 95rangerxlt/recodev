Investigated. This is a bug in the type hierarchy when losing focus:
SelectionProviderMediator.propagateFocusChanged(Viewer viewer) {
  if (viewer != fViewerInFocus) { // Ok to compare by idendity
    fViewerInFocus= viewer;
    fireSelectionChanged();
  }
}
calls fireSelectionChanged() and there a "null" selection is fired because the
fViewerInFocus is null. This clears the Java Browsing views.

Moving to MA.
