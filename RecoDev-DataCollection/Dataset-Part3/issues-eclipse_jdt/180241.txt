FileteredTypesSelectionDialog.ConsistencyRunnable (line 572) passes in a monitor that had beginTask(...) already called. This is against the rule: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/FAQ_How_do_I_use_a_SubProgressMonitor%3F.

This causes no progress to be reported since the SearchEngine expects a fresh progress monitor and also calls beginTask(...).
