1. Install the embedded graphics plugin by unzipping the file ivegphx.zip into 
your plugins directory.
2. Open Eclipse, go to a java perspective/packages view.
3. Create a new java project.
4. Import the sample code zip file, samplecode.zip, into the new project.
5. Make sure Test is expanded and it's one package is expanded (no need to 
expand the JRE_LIB).
6. Select the new java project, popup the context menu, and select the "Create 
Embedded Image" option.  A wizard will open with 14 files selected.  Press 
Finish.

Notice that within the hierarchy the Test Project item goes blank for a second 
or two as do all of its children.  The blanking out behavior is even more 
pronounced with more files.  Do the same thing in the Resource Perspective and 
you do not see this behavior.  This behavior is better than it is in R1.0, but 
it is still slow (i.e., 14 files isn't that much).  

Within WSDD creating embedded image files for a collection of gifs is common.  
Is this behavior a bug and/or can it be improved speed-wise?  If not, is there 
some way for us to better handle this type of operation?  The plugin includes 
its source.
