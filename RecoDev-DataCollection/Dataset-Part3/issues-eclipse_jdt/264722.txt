We currently have two working set comparators (WorkingSetSortComparator and WorkingSetComparator). We should remove one and make the remaining one configurable whether to sort the "other" working set on top. The remaining one should live in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.workingsets.

Fixed. Merged the two working set comparators into one class.
Looks good except the new WorkingSetComparator class:
- strange formatting (some methods indented but shouldn't be)
- superfluous @since 3.5 tags (if the class itself is new and has @since 3.5 then
  it is not needed to flag each member
- missing constructor comments
- use && instead of two ifs:
  if (fIsOtherWorkingSetOnTop) {
	if (OthersWorkingSetUpdater.ID.equals(workingSet.getId()))
