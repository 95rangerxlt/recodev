I20080122-0800.

Organize imports adds imports for types in Javadoc of package-info.java. This is wrong as the Javadoc tool ignores those imports for package-info.java, package.html and overview.html

NOTE: This got accidentally introduced when fixing bug 157541.

Marking for 3.4 as this got introduced during 3.4.
