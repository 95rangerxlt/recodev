3.2 and HEAD; was OK in 3.1.2

The Packages view does not show children of packages from jars in hierarchical presentation mode.

Steps:
- import org.junit as binary plug-in
- switch to Java Browsing perspective
- set Package Presentation of Packages view to Hierarchical
- select org.junit in Projects view
-> package junit is shown as empty package with no children

Martin changed the filtering stuff. Package Explorer might also be affected.
No, Package Explorer is fine. In the Packages view, it also doesn't work if all filters are disabled. Interesting, that this has not been found in half a year ;-)
