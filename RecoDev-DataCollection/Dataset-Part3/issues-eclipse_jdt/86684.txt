Fixed in HEAD and added regression test.

Processing JUnit 3.8.1 with settings ...
- assume clone() is well behaved
- do not leave unconstrained raw

... now results in only two unavoidable type safety warnings like this:

	private synchronized Vector<TestListener> cloneListeners() {
		return (Vector<TestListener>)fListeners.clone();
	}
Markus, can you create a plug-in export containing this code. May be I can use it.
