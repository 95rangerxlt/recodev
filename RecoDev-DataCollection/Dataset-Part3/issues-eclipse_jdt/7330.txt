I could not find the action "Add Javadoc Comment" until I switched to the
Outline view. I expected the action to be
1. in the context menu and if not
2. in the Edit (or some other global) menu

I think currently we distribute the actions on a personal taste basis. This
should be changed. It is not clear to users why some actions are in the context
menu and some are not (OK - not all need to be in the context menu but all must
be reachable from the editor e.g. via Edit menu). It is not acceptable to force
users to switch the view.

the action is also missing in the packages view. Shouldn't this action be part 
of the code generation group then the packages view will get it.

We are currently not consistent which actions are available on resolved text 
selections in the editor. For example, the following actions could be 
contributed, but are not:
- override method (for types)
- replace from local history (for members)
- Add Javadoc comment
This needs to be revisited during the menu reorg.

it is now menu reorg time and we should make more actions available on text 
selections. In particular now that the Source menu is "global"

The following action should not use the resolved element as selection, but the 
cursor position. For example:
- override method (for types)/Add Constructor from Superclass
      use the innermost type that contains the text selection as the target
- Add Javadoc comment
      use the inner most element that contains the text selection as the target
- generate/getter setter
      user the inner most type and offer all its fields in a dialog

Once we have done this we should look into providing support for:
- Add from local history
- Replace from local history
Once we have it done

All Source actions now work in the text editor too.
