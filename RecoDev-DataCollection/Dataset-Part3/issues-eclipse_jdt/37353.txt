Martin, please comment.
The 'edit' button brings you to the preference page where you also can add a new
variable.

How do I add a variable from this dialog?
Never mind i see what you are talking about.
So what is the point of this intermediary dialog box?  Why not go straight to
the preference page?  

If the point is for the extend button why not have the extend button on the
preferences dialog or conditional on in the preferences dialog depending on the
entry point to the dialog?

If you agree then perhaps changing title of bug to extranous dialog box makes
more sense.


Not that one dialog is a selection dialog, while the other a configuration dialog.
In 2.0 we had a merged page where you could at the same time configure and
select, but it was the cause of a lot of confusion. (and bug reports).
What we should do is to move the 'edit' button below the table and rename it to
'configure variables', so it's obvious that the button state is not dependend on
the selection.
Alright it makes a little more sense now.  I think the changes you mention will
make it more intuitive.
