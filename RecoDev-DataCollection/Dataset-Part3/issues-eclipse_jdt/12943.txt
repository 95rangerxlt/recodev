We have changed the default values of these templates to be empty. This helps 
to avoid unhelpful comments, but it doesn't help the user to find out how to 
customize the generated comments.

I therefore suggest that the comment is no longer empty and includes a 
description for how to change the default, e.g., for the filecomment

/**
 * Created on ${date}
 *
 * To change this generated comment edit the template variable "filecomment":
 * Workbench>Preferences>Java>Templates.
 */

There is an NLS issue here and we have to tell the translators to translate 
this XML file as well.
