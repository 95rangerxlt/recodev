I can't use the default shortcut for "show occurences" anymore with version 3.2. I f I redefine it to be the shortcut Ctrl-U, it does function.

I've created a new workspace, to check if it's caused by some odd, old preferences, but even then it doesn't function.

I'm using the linux-gtk Version of eclipse 3.2 on SuSE 10.0 and I have never modified the gnome/gtk settings.

The shortcut Shift-Ctrl-T does function, very weird.

Shift+CTRL+U is the replacement for the SHIFT+CTRL+<hex> keys in linux GTK

It's part of GTK.

I don't understand the conclusion. Does it mean "Shift-Ctrl-u" is not a legal shortcut for gtk? Why does it function with eclipse 3.1.2 (linux-gtk) - same computer, same os, same workspace, ...? What should I press instead of it, if eclipse tells me to press "Shift-Ctrl-u"?
That's exactly right ... CTRL+SHIFT+U is not a legal shortcut for GTK.

From the GTK release notes:
The hexadecimal Unicode input feature has been reworked. It no longer blocks the use of the sixteen Ctrl-Shift-<hex digit> key sequences. Now it only uses Ctrl-Shift-u.

You can go the Window>Preferences>General>Keys page an re-assign a new shortcut to the key that you want.

The new shortcut for "Occurrences in File" on Linux is Ctrl+Alt+U.
