A couple of options on the Code Formatter|Style panel of the Preferences is
really unclear in my opinion. I am talking about
  Indentation is represented by a tab
  Number of spaces representing a tab

The first option would be clearer if it said something like
  Use hard tabs for indentation, not spaces
or something to that effect, like
  Insert tabs for indentation, not spaces
  Insert hard tabs for indentation, not spaces

The second one is really bad though. It has nothing to do with tabs, but rather
the number of spaces to use when indenting, when tabs are turned off (e.g. if
the first option is not checked). So, first of all, it should be greyed out if
the first option is selected, since it will have no effect in that case. And the
description should be changed to something clearer, like:
  Number of spaces to insert per indentation level.
  Number of spaces representing an indentation level.
etc. That, together with the fact that it will be greyed out if tabs are turned
on, will make it clearer how both of these options work.

Every person I know who has used Eclipse has been confused by how these two
settings work, in relationship with the the setting on the Appearance pane of
the Editor area which also has a setting for displayed tab width, and the other
setting on the Editor|Behaviour pane which has a setting for 'Insert Spaces for
Tabs'.

Martin, we should consider the wording improvements.

We can't gray out the second if the first option is selected. Consider the case 
that a file uses spaces for indention (it got imported without reformatting) 
then we use the number of spaces representing a tab to convert spaces into the 
right number of tabs. 
As far as I can tell, you do not 'use the number of spaces representing a tab to
convert spaces into the right number of tabs' on a reformat operation. You do
what you should, which is to use the control flow elements of the code itself to
reformat the code. So if I bring in a file with spaces, and reformat, you ignore
the existing spaces, and indent with tabs, using an extra tab for each deeper
level of code. This seems to apply to comments too

So on this basis, I think you could grey out the 2nd (Number of spaces
representing a tab) option if the first is checked. Am I missing something? Do
you actually use the value from the 2nd option anywhere if the first is checked?
What you say is correct for a reformat of a whole file.
But there are many operations on code that e.g. insert new code and have to fit 
in the existing structure, by using the settings from the code formatter.
Example is the shift-right operation that reduces the indent of a file, it 
needs the 'spaces representing a tab' option even if you configured to only use 
tabs (for new files).
changed the labels as suggested
- Insert &tabs for indentation, not spaces
- &Number of spaces representing an indentation level
