The org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.projects is pretty useless as the only thing it does is adding a wizard that creates a new Java project and imports outdated JUnit code.
We also need to
- update /www/jdt/ui/dev.php
- make sure the project gets removed from the list of project's that use
  third-party software (JUnit)
And change the link to the JUnit source JAR in the getting started guide.
