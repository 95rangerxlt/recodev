To support refreshing views when the contents of an external JAR has changed 
there is now a new flag: IJavaElementDelta.F_ARCHIVE_CONTENT_CHANGED

I've added support for the flag in the JavaElementContentProvider
We have to handle this flag in all our views (outline, search?, type 
hierarchy). Dani can you pls handle this in the Browsing related content 
providers.

Dirk is adding support to trigger a refresh of external JARs in the UI. Once 
this support is available we can test the refresh.

updated priority, since this is committed for F2
Fixed.

we also need to do this in the type hierarchy in the case it shows a type from 
a JAR
this should work as this for sure triggers a type hierarchy changed event
confirmed.

The class file editor should also listen to this flag and close/refresh itself.
All class file editors showing children of the changed package fragment root 
should be closed.
