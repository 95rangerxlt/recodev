The fall through selection should probably only issue ones which either where 
already qualified, or ones which do not need any qualification.
Local variable declaration selection was not supported and when no answer is 
found then the SelectionEngine propose types named like the identifier of the 
selection.

Now selection on local declaration is supported and answer the type of the 
local.
Fixed.
