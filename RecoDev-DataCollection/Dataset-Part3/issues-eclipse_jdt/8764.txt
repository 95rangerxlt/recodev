build 20020129

I got an internal error while closing the projects org.eclipse.ant, 
org.eclipse.xerces, org.eclipse.core.boot, org.eclipse.core.runtime, 
org.eclipse.swt, org.junit. I had previously imported these projects as binary 
plugins using the PDE selfhosting plugin.
Autobuild was turned on. I did not get an exception when I reopened and 
reclosed the projects. I have zipped up the workspace anyway in case it helps.
