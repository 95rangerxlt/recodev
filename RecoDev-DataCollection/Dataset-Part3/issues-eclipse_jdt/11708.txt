Why is the option "Show in Packages view" available in the packages view?
Show in packages view is currently contributed as an object contribution for 
JavaElements. We will change to contribute this action in code to the context 
menu. The action will still show up in the planned Navigate Menu even when the 
packages view is active.

Dirk you are working on the Navigate menu, pls take care of this issue as well.
