I find myself unable to export "source code + resources" into a JAR archive.

The "finish" button just stays inactive, with no visual feedback
whatsoever what's wrong about this.

I can export "class files + resources".  When I compare what the two things
look like, the main difference seems to be that the "source code + resources"
UI has no mention of manifest files.

Workaround: Source code export into ZIP.

This is eclipse GM6...

For what it's worth: This is also a regression.  I used to be able to do it,
otherwise, I would not have been able to post bugs like bug 20153 or bug 19783.
Verified against R2.0
Can not reproduce.

Please reopen bug with steps to reproduce if you see the bug with R2.0

In 2.0, it's better.
But I still cannot export unless I put my checkmark to
"Save the description of this JAR in the workspace."

(If that matters: I selected several projects at once.)
The reason was a bug in the options logic which is now fixed.

If you reuse an existing (2.0 or prior) workspace your Jar Export option
preferences might still be incorrect. To fix this:
1. Open JAR Exporter
2. Select to export class files and Java source
3. Set the Manifest options so that the Manifest is generated but not saved
5. Ensure that the export is successful (wizard closes without a dialog)
   Note: Simply select a single file to achieve this

Your preferences should now be OK.
