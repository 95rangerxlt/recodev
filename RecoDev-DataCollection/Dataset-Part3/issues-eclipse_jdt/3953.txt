The current implementation of a the global type cache isn't integrated into the AllTypesSearchEngine. Instead the
	engine is passed as a parameter to the type cache. 

	Why don't we always use the AllTypesSearchEngine and the engine is responsible for maintaining a cache.

moved to 'active'

we did the code review the TypeCache is still separate so I assume the 
conclusion was to not move the TypeCache.
it's because of a vcm bug
note that 2 TypeCaches exist and only one is used
i have deleted the other one at least twice now.
well, what else can i do - will try to delete it again <g>
deleted
