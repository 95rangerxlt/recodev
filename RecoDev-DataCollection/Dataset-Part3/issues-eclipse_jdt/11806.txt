Hello,
Could it be possible to have the ability to see the line numbers in the java 
editor (but also in all source code editors)?

it's in there - see the status line
I mean I would like to see the line numbers in the editor for each line, for 
instance like in the TextPad tool. It is very useful for large files. For 
instance, you want to edit a .jsp file or a big java file. 
In my case, I'm currently making a Delphi parser, and I've huge files with a 
lot of productions... To have visually the ability the find the line is really 
a plus
