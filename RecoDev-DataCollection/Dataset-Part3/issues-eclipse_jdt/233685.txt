Benno, can you investigate on Monday - especially whether the tests run on 3.3 ;-)
I needer see them displayed in bold nor in the fingerprint in the performance results of RC2. I guess they have a star and are compared because there was no baseline created yet. The last baseline run on 0520-1301 but the test have been released into 0520-2000. Maybe we just missed it. I've verified that the changes have been released into the performance stream, the project have been tagged and the map file is updated. It's also possible, that the assertion failed in 3.3, but do you know where to find this information?

When I look at it I'd say it got released on 05-15.

Take a look at EventDrivenTestSuite ;-)
