We requested from JFace to adopt our DND classes (see bug 10146). This happened
for 3.1 and hence we should get rid of ours.

Daniel, I already looked into this but as usual Platform/UI changed them
slightly. So no easy replacement ;-). I will have a look again, but might have
to close the bug.
Moving back to inbox. Ownership changed.

fix

Removing our DelegatingDragAdapter and DelegatingDropAdapter. Unfortunately I can't reuse platforms ViewerDropAdapter because it lacks an important feature. But I changed our implementation to be almost identical to the platform one.

improved fix

This version is even closer to the ViewerDropAdapter
Filed bug 197965 against platform to merge the two implementations.
