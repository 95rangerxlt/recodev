When requesting a method declaration completion, it should be inserted a 
Javadoc and some curly braces at the end (with cursor located in between).
We shouldn't add JavaDoc automatically since this can supress the javadoc 
feature for inheriting the spec from base classes (there is a preference for 
this).

What would also be nice as well is to generate a stub with the super call.

The code snippet inserted for method declarations is now generated by jdt.ui
(includes comments/super call)
