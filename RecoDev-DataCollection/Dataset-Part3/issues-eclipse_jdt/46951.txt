It would be useful if the new  "Introduce Factory" refactory would allow to specify on which class 
the "createXxx" method is created.
The current behavior always creates the method on the least likely class.

This is something we had on the plan for M6 anyway.

Patch to add JUnit regression tests for this feature

N.B.: This patch file also includes test support for fixing Bugzilla bug
#47409.
Robert, the patch is missing the resource bundle changes for refactoring UI. 
Can you please attach them ?
The JDT-UI patch file does contain a hunk for refactoringui.properties. If 
that's not what you mean by "resource bundle changes", can you clarify for the 
resource-challenged :-)?
My fault.
The UI doesn't look nice: I suggest the follwing changes:

Method name: [entry field            ]
In class:    [entry field            ] [Browse]
[x] Make constructor private

Additionally the error message 'no such class' doesn't follow the Eclipse 
style either. We try to include the type string into the error message to give 
users a better hint about the failure.

Updated patch with reorganized UI

Patch created against jdt.ui HEAD as of Monday 12/15/2003, 3:50PM EDT.
I haven't released the patch. Two reasons:

- the labels aren't aligned with the checkbox. I recoded the layout and added
  a patch for the wizard page to the PR

- when creating the factory method in a different class, no imports are
  created. See bug 48831.
