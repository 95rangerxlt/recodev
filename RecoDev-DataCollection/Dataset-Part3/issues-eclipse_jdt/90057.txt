*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 89097 ***
Can you please explain why this was marked as a duplicate?

Bug 89097 was resolved because the strings in question were found in File:
org.eclipse.jdt.ui/core refactoring/
org/eclipse/jdt/internal/corext/refactoring/nls/NLSMessages.properties

I cannot find "default" in this file....
I assumed it's caused by the same bug which it is not.

Fixed in HEAD.
