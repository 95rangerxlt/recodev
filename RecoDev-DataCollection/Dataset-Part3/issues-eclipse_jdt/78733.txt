If you pass an IMethod to the ITypeHierarchyViewPart.setInputElement
(IJavaElement element) it does not select the method like the normal "F4" in 
the Java Editor does. My use case is as follows:

Properties p = new Properties();
p.getProperty("foo");

Where Properties is java.util.Properties and you try to "F4" (an action 
implemented using ITypeHierarchyViewPart) the getProperty method.

I'm using Eclipse 3.0.

Martin, can you please have a look.
on F4 we use an extra method called 'selectMember' which is not in 
ITypeHierarchyViewPart

Maybe you can use the OpenTypeHierarchyAction?
That action relies on a JavaEditor and we don't have one.

It really looks like a bug to me if you pass an IMethod to the  
ITypeHierarchyViewPart.setInputElement() and the method does not get selected.
OpenTypeHierarchyAction is dual use: for editors and for IWorkbenchParts (2 
different constructors)

But I agree that setInputElement on IMember should select the member
