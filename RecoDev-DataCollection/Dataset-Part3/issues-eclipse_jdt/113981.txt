On MacOS X, we would like "Command+Shift+?" to show the help contents (Bug 
95603).  As it stands right now, on some keyboards, "Command+Shift+?" is 
grabbed by "org.eclipse.jdt.ui.edit.text.java.add.block.comment".  It would be 
helpful if this binding could be (re)moved on MacOS X.

Hm, we only bind M1+M2+/ (slash), and I remember ? being Shift+/ on a en_US
keyboard, right?

Moving will be hard, as there isn't anything left in the keybinding space...

Remove: IMO, "add block comment" is not such an important command that it
deserves a binding at all cost - but it will cause some trouble for people that
have gotten used to it.

Is this urgent - I'd like to leave this for Dani to decide (1 Week).
I would recommend just dropping the binding on MacOS X.  I also agree that 
it's not really an important enough command to have a binding by default. 
 
Doug, what are you planning to do for German keyboards where '?' is on the ''' key?

We already have a problem with Add/Remove Block Comment (see bug 96076).
I thought the funky B/S character appeared with the ? on German keyboards 
(http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~tphillip/GermanKeyboardLayout.html).  This did 
not seem like it would be a problem. 
I forgot the 'Swiss' in front of German ;-)
Ctrl+Shift+? would still work in this case, as no one is binding Ctrl+Shift+' 
We will free this on the Mac.
Fixed in HEAD.
