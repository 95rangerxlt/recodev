I am using the latest integration build - 20020425-linux-gtk1x - and when I
press Ctrl-Space for code completion, the code completion box appears and
immediately disappears. I have to keep pressing Ctrl-Space so that it appears
and disappears a zillion times then I press arrow down so that it stays there
and I can choose one completion.

I initially thought the window manager was to blame, but it worked the same on
KDE3 and gnome 1.4 + sawfish.

This is fixed in GTK2.0.

I suggest you try the GTK2 version, as 1x is getting very little attention.
