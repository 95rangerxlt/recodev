In 2.1 [20030129]


Automatic formatting of javadoc comments is nice feature


for writing javadocs.




However, it is not working properly with <pre></pre> tags.


Very often piece of example code (or such) is wanted to be 


provided within javadoc. 




Autoformatting feature makes it next to impossible to write them,


since feature automatically completely messes up them.
