When there is no selection in the package explorer (when you have collapsed a
tree item for example) the context menu contains actions for "open project",
"open projects" and "close projects".  The only one that does anything is "open
project", although it shouldn't be visible.

OpenCloseWorkingSetAction#getProjects (both of them) are returning an empty
array and the actions are enabled if the election is != null.  Forcing the
getProjects methods to return null when the list is empty fixed the problem for me.

ie:
if (selection.isEmpty()) return null; for the one that takes a structured
selection and
if (set.getElements().length == 0) return null;
for the one taht takes a working set

The open project action does make sense since it shows a dialog from which you
can select closed project. This is especially useful when filtering closed projects.

You are right for the other two actions.
Fixed.
