204:
1. create a project with 'src' as source folder and 'bin' as output location.
2. in the project properties change the setting to use the project as source 
folder and the project as output location. Press Ok
You get the error message:
'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src'

The problem is that setting outputlocation and classpath are two operations.
By setting the first, an illegal state is created.

-> Like the validation (checking classpath and outputlocation at once), the 
setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation.

Note that the error message is strange. I guess it should say: '/xy/src' can 
not be nested in '/xy'

Should add a new API for setting both (setOutputLocation0 + setRawClasspath).
Adding IJavaProject#setRawClasspath(IClasspathEntry[]newClassPath , IPath 
newOutputLocation, IProgressMonitor)

allowing to initialize both at the same time.

Note: the invalid error message got fixed as well.

Fixed
adopted jdt code to use new API
