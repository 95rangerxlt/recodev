When more than on file gets opened the OpenAction should execute the for loop 
inside JavaCore.run to batch Java Model Deltas. This would reduce flickering in 
the package explorer and other Java views.

Postpone > 2.1
Just to note that bug 30215 was on the "hot list" of PRs to address for 2.1 
based on input from the other teams.

Reopening
We retested bug 30125 and the package explorer doesn't flicker anymore in 
I20030216.

The bug got addressed by fixing bug 30623 and by supressing label updates in 
the tree viewer (passing false to updateLabels when refreshing tree nodes).
