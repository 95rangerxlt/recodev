I have the following Java editor template defined:
-----------
/**
 * ${desc}.
 */
private ${vartype} ${variable};

/**
 * Gets ${desc}.
 * @return ${desc}
 */
public ${vartype} get${variable}()
{
  return ${variable};
}
/**
 * Sets ${desc}.
 * @param new${variable} new value of ${desc}
 */
public void set${variable}(${vartype} new${variable})
{
  ${variable} = new${variable};
}
---------

When I start typing value for vartype, I often use code completion assistant. 
E.g. type "big" and press Ctrl+Space, select BigDecimal from the list and hit 
Enter.

The problem introduced in Eclipse 3 is that hitting Enter to select code 
completion proposal automatically terminates the template itself (you can not 
enter other parameters).

Sergey, which build are you using? Please also see:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-text-home/development/bug-incomplete.htm

Tom, please investigate.
Sorry, forgot to mention that. It happened both in Eclipse 3.0 (release) and 
3.0.1 (release) versions that I installed.

Anyway, here's my current build data:
Version: 3.0.1
Build id: 200409161125

Part of this is fixed in 3.1M2 (see bug 70663) - as long as you don't give focus
to the code completion popup, everything should work. If you do give focus to
the popup, the shell switch causes linke mode to exit.

This can be fixed using the editor helper facility introduced for bug 70663.
fixed the focus case > 20041102
