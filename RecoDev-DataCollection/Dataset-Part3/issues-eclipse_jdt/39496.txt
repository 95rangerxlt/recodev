Build 20030625

junit.framework.Assert.assertNotSame(...) says that it asserts that the 2

It should say that it asserts they are NOT the same.

Also the implementation checks for identity, not equality as same would suggest.

sounds like a junit.org problem, not eclipse
Although it is junit.org you might want to fix this.
