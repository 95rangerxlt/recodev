From bug 391893, comment #15:

The ECJ grammar at the moment reads:

VariableDeclaratorIdOrThis ::= 'this'
VariableDeclaratorIdOrThis ::= UnannotatableName '.' 'this'

UnannotatableName -> SimpleName
UnannotatableName ::= UnannotatableName '.' SimpleName

This is the bug for the grammar fix that is needed. The second
rule needs to change to be 
VariableDeclaratorIdOrThis ::= SimpleName '.' 'this'

Proposed fix

I didn't make any grammar change. Instead I chose to fix the problem while resolving the receiver in AbstractMethodDeclaration.

One note is that I couldn't think of a better name for the new problem ID. Perhaps, they could use a better name. No new tests added as changes to some existing tests cover that part.

Another note on this patch is that Receiver#qualifyingName is still a NameReference and not a SingleNameReference.

Patch with minor update

The previous patch had a small error as a piece of change made it to the patch on bug 391893 instead of this one.
Here are the comments:

(1) In ProblemReporter.illegalQualifierForExplicitThis2, it looks like 
receiver.qualifyingName can never be null ?

(2) In illegalQualifierForExplicitThis, do we need object duplication in

		new String[] { new String(expectedType.sourceName())},
		new String[] { new String(expectedType.sourceName())},

(3) AMD: Space between ) and { please:

else if (tokens != null && tokens.length > 0){
Released with the review suggestions. The fix is here:
