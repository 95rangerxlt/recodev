When applying the Clean Up Wizard with the option "Use modifier 'final' where possible" active, it doesn't check if an variable has the "volatile" keyword. The result is a compiler error for affected classes.

Mmm, fields can either be final or volatile, not both, we should check for that, your right, no doubt: It's a bug...

But, why do you define a variable as volatile if you never write to it (otherwise the clean up would (or should) not mark it as final)

Clean up fix on our side is to replace the volatile keyword by final.

Or did I misunderstand your problem?
I agree with you that defining a variable volatile and not changing it is totally useless ;) The variable was a leftover after some changes.

But nevertheless, there shouldn't be any compiler errors after a Clean Up run, so replacing the volatile by final should be the correct solution.
