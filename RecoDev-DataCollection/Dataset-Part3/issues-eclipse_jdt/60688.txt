*** Bug 64089 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Possibly related to this, what about comments within methods?  (This would 
probably be restricted to non-Javadoc multi-line comments.)

Example:

class Test{
	/**
	 * This folds...
	 */
	/*
	 * As does this...
	 */
	void test(){
		/*
		 * But this doesn't!
		 */
	}
}

I was thinking this could be an issue in that it would cause nested folding (of 
the comment and of the method), but it's already properly handled as items can 
be folded within the class, and the class can properly be folded.

While we're at it, what about other block statements, such as if's and 
while's?  Many other IDE's out there allow folding of practically everything.

please log a separate bug report.
