The Spelling preference page offers to set a dictonary. The user does not have a
hint about what's expected and what the file extension of the dictonary is.
On Linux with GTK, the dictionary file browser does not specify the extension so
the only way is to change the selector to "all files" and use that to select a
dictionary. Solution: the file extension should be part of the drop down list.
"Dictionary Files (*.dict)" or whatever it really is...because I still haven't
found out.
Same problem on WindowsXP.

You can use any file with any extension. The format is a simple word list.
Please let us know the mysterious file extension, either in the preference page or  as a comment to this bug entry.

I /know/ you can use any text file, but as indicated, .dic files should be shown by default, or else the selector should automatically show ‘All files’.  And it would be nice if ‘somewhere’ (preferably on the preferences page itself) comment 2 would be mentioned.
