build GM6

There are a few usability issues with the libraries page of the project 
properties.
1. "Add Variable" dialog is too small. Widgets are squished together and hardly 
any variable is fully visible. The dialog should be twice as big.

2. "Advanced" option is extremely confusing. 
  2a) As far as I understand the containers are only extensible using an 
extension point. This should be mentioned in the user doc. The user is left 
wondering what the containers are good for if they can't define new ones.
  2b) It would be easier to understand if the options in the Advanced dialog 
are represented by two separate dialogs. I.e., replace "Advanced" button 
with "Add Class Folder" and "Add Container". 
  2c) The flow of the Advanced option is awkward. Getting the selection dialog 
when closing the Advanced dialog is weird. This could be improved with a Browse 
and a New button for the class folder as well as a text field that displays the 
selection. Something like the source attachment. This could be done quite 
easily when adding a separate Add Class Folder dialog.

3. The Edit button (great new feature BTW) is in a strange place. It's not 
related to the Attach Source button, yet they are grouped together.
Maybe it would be better below the Attach Source button.

The whole dialog got reworked. IMO all items are addressed except may be the 
size of the add variable dialog. But the dialog is resizable and IMO it should 
not be much bigger.
