Improve editor code navigation. The Java editor should allow the user to 
navigate in the type hierarchy from a selected element. For instance, the 
editor should show override indicators (currently shown only in the outliner 
view), and allow direct navigation to the declaration of the overridden 
method. The editor should also provide more information about the currently 
selected element such as all referenced types, call sites, overriders, 
implementors, declaration. [JDT UI] [Theme: User experience]

This has been implemented for 3.0 except for the last item:
"The editor should also provide more information about the currently 
selected element such as all referenced types, call sites, overriders, 
implementors, declaration".

I'm closing this PR as FIXED since it stood for a 3.0 plan item and the above
feature is no longer part of the 3.1 plan.
