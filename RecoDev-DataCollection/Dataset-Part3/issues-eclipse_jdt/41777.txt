From the 2003-08-20 search build notes:

Added a new attribute "canSearchEnclosingProjects" to the extension point
  "org.eclipse.search.searchPages". If the attribute is set to true, the search
  dialog scope area will have a new radio button labeled "Enclosing Projects".
  Search page contributors whishing to support search in projects enclosing the
  current selection have to set this attribute to true and handle the new search
  scope constant org.eclipse.search.ui.ISearchPageContainer.SELECTED_PROJECTS_SCOPE.

The NLS search page should support this feature.

best what to do ;-).
