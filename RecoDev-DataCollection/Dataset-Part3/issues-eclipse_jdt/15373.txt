In build 502, with an empty workspace, the following problem occurs.  Creating 
a Java project, a package, and two classes results in only one class being 
shown in the Packages view.  Refreshing has no effect.  If I switch into the 
Navigation view I can see the .class and .java files for the new classes I 
created.  There are no error messages.

To replicate:
1) Start with a vanilla workspace
2) Create a project
3) Create a package
4) Create two classes.  Note that the other class should not appear in the 
packages view at this point.

I have tried to restart the workbench after this, thinking that perhaps it will 
show up.  It doesn't.  However, I have noticed that if you bring in a project 
from CVS that has multiple classes you will be able to see new classes in other 
projects afterwards.

I saw this & closing the Java perspective & re-opening it fixed it for me. 
Richard, does this help you?

Yes, it works for me now.  I have yet to try this with a later build, so the 
behavior may have been fixed.  Will check 508 and close if it goes away.


Checked with build 510 and the problem is resolved.
