if it is done, there should be a don't warn me again option.
It is the doclet that decides which files are written. So we could only guess, 
if the destination location already exists, or if the standard doclet is used 
we could check for an existing index.html file.


>It is the doclet that decides
Not fully true (e.g. the .xml file is known by the workspace)
I agree with you regarding the doclet generated stuff.


How about this, if the user is using the standard doclet a warning is displayed 
in the wizard header if the javadoc destination specified contains either the 
file 'packag-list' or 'index.html'.

The only problem with this approach is that the user can not decide/check
[] Overwrite existing files
He always sees the warning icon in your approach and has to read the message.
A combination of both would be fine and would honor EGs wish:
>if it is done, there should be a don't warn me again option.

Right now a warning appears in the wizard heading. The option of displaying a 
dialog was decided against because the wizard already pops up 2 dialogs 
(sometimes 3) on finish.

JRT.
I think the current solution is good enough. Mostly you overwrite existing 
pages. And we can't add another pop up dialog.
