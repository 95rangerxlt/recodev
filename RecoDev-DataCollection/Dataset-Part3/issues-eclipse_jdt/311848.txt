The installBreakpoint Method in JavaBreakpointListenerProxy (a inner class of BreakpointListenerManager) is implemented this way:

public int installingBreakpoint(IJavaDebugTarget target, IJavaBreakpoint breakpoint, IJavaType type) {
   IJavaBreakpointListener delegate = getDelegate();
   if (delegate != null) {
      delegate.installingBreakpoint(target, breakpoint, type);
   }
   return IJavaBreakpointListener.DONT_CARE;
}

This way the return of the delegate is ignored. To me the correct statement would be:

return delegate.installingBreakpoint(target, breakpoint, type);

like it is in breakpointHit.

Reproducible: Always
