Still exist, but there is not much we can do. The override icon is contributed 
by a decorator and therefore doesn't know anything about other decorations. 
This would require a descriptive support from the workbench to figure out which 
other adornments exist.

we have now a combined image for synchronized & override resp. synchronized &
