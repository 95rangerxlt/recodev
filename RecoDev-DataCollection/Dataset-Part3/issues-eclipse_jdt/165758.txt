Given:
package test;
public class E1 {
	public E1(String label) {}
	public E1() {
		String s= "foo";
		this(s);
	}
}
1. Select variable 's'
2. Inline 's' (either through quick assist or through refactor menu)
Is:
public E1() {
	this(s);
}
Should:
public E1() {
	this("foo");
}

No exception is thrown.

The problem is that "s" in "this(s)" does not have a binding, see bug 166963.

But even without the "this(s);", the refactoring dialog currently says
"Inline 0 occurrences of local variable 's'?", which amounts to removing the declaration.

We could show a warning in cases where 0 occurrences have been found, e.g.
"The local variable 's' is not referenced anywhere. Do you want to remove the declaration?".

I'm not sure what the quick assist should do if there are no references, since it has no way to warn the user. Martin?
Fix for bug 166963 got scheduled for 3.3M7
Verified that the fix for bug 166963 fixes comment 0.

Improved message in the Inline Local Variable dialog to tell that the variable declaration will simply be removed when no references are found.
