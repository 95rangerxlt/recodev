import java.util.List;
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new List
	}
}

Invoke Content Assist after "new List" and choose "java.awt.List".  An import statement is added which clashes with the existng one.

Better would be to replace the unused import or fully qualify the new List.

Similar to bug 14389, bug 61409, bug 83467.

The import rewrite only considers imports which types are actually used which is wrong: it should simply look at the imports.

If I add "List l;" to the test case it works as expected.
