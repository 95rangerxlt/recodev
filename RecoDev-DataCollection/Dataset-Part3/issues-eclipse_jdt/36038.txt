I would like to completely disable comment generation, and believed I had done
from the UI, but still, when I type /* and hit return, I get the following:

/*
 * This comment is specified in template 'typecomment'.
(Window>Preferences>Java>Templates)
*/

Not only is the comment incorrect, as the correct path is
Window>Preferences>Java>Editor>Templates, but I have selected Disable All from
the aforementioned path, yet the comment still appears.

is this 2.1?

in 2.1, the comment that is inserted is defined in preferences > Java > Code
Generation you can define it there (set it to an empty comment)


This has no effect.

Please see the screenshot:

Note in the Java editor display the comment.
Also note that Preferences->Java->Code Generation->Code and
Comments->Comments->Types is:

/**
*/

Also note that it is 2.1, as the About Eclipse Platform window shows.

Regards,

Ricky.
please change to the 2.1 release build (20030327), this got fixed.
(you're using 20030221)

Thanks for the screenshot!
