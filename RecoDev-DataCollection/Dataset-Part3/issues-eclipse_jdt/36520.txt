Patch for the max call depth preference

I've attached a patch with a number of changes. Some of the changes are not
related to this bug but are things I've done to the code since you committed it
to CVS.

The changes are:
1) Moved the non-ui classes to the corext.callhierarchy package.
2) Added a filter dialog.
3) Moved the max call depth preference to filter dialog (this fixes the first
part of bug #36515).
patch released
Adam,

CallHierarchyTest needs to have its imports organized. I guess it's easier for
you to do it yourself than me submitting a patch.
fixed
