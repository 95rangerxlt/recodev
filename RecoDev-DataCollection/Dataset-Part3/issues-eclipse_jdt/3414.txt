14/tests/lang/BINC/binc057/binc05701/binc05701.html - POSITIVE TEST
	This is a binary compatibility test. You need to compile the test cases 
in the same order I put them below one by one. And then execute it. The problem 
with the Eclipse
	compiler occurs only at runtime.

Test cases:

	javac 1.4:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: passed with java.lang.IllegalAccessError: try to 
access field javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc057.binc05701.binc05701s.f from class 
javasoft.sqe.tests.lang.binc057.binc05701.binc05701c

	javac 1.3:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

	Eclipse compiler:
		compilation: OK
		runtime: failed

NOTES:

	OT (19/09/2001 12:38:42 PM)
		Same explanation than for 1GK7VSN: ITPJCORE:WIN2000 - JCK 1.4 - 
the new field is a static (respectively instance) field.
		We specify Super to the declaring class of the field. Then we 
never go through binc05701s to do the lookup and we don't detect that there is 
a new field with the same 
		signature that is not visible. We definitely need to change the 
declaring class of the field to fix these PRs, but this would break the 1.3 
compatibility.

Adapted to this change for 1.4 mode only.
Fixed
