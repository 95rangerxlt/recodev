There's no baseline data available for TypeHierarchyPerfTest, see e.g. http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/I20080523-0100/performance/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.php?

I guess this is due to bug 209222. In some circumstances (e.g. also when I debug the test on my machine), the test produces a StackOverflowError, which opens a dialog on the test machine.

I'll commit a workaround for bug 209222 in the perf_33x branch.

Kim: If you still have the logs from the last baseline run, could you please check whether my theory was correct and the test really timed out?

Bingo! That's the problem from bug 209222, and the workaround will avoid the fragile code path in the next baseline run.

Keeping the bug open as a reminder to verify success after 2008-06-02.

About time we close this :)
