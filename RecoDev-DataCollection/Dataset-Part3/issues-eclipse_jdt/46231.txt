I recommend a new quick fix, which could available on a constructor in java src 
editor or as menuitem below "Source" in the context menu of the java src editor.

The function is oppotite to "Generate Constructor Using Fields".

This feature could iterate through all constructor params and generate src 
lines like :

    this.<variable N fom contrutor> = <variable N fom contrutor> ;
    ....
    and so on.

Example
-------
public DefaultNetworkPanel (MyDB db, EditHelper eh, int nr, boolean on)
{
  super();
  this.db = db;  // generated by feature
  this.eh = eh;  // generated by feature
  this.nr = nr;  // generated by feature
  this.on = on; // generated by feature
}

Time permitted.
This is already there ad quick fix. Select a parameter name and press CTRL + 1
fixed in M4
 I've never tried QFix on a specific parameter.
Thanks!
