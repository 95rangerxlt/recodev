When generating Javadocs, 'javadoc' generates output like:
Filename.java:linenumber: warning - @param argument "xxx" is not a parameter name.

It would be good if these could be clickable just like stack traces, so the
coder can easily make corrections.

Martin, please comment.
would be nice to have. but not trivial as the output depends on the doclet used.
this got added I think for 3.1 (maybe earlier)
