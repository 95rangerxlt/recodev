STEPS:
1. Set a breakpoint at line x of a java file.
2. Add y blank lines to the java file before line x so that the code that was
previously on line x is now on line x+y

Verify that the Breakpoints View still shows this breakpoint on line x.

3. Save and close the Java file.

Verify that the Breakpoints View still shows this breakpoint on line x.

4. Re-open the java file.

Verify that the breakpoint is shown in the margin on line x (a blank line) while
the code it was set to break on is at line x+y.
