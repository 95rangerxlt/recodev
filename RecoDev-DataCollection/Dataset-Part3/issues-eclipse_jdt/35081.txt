Breakpoints do not appear in editors for nested types. Neither breakpoints
set in the enclosing type's editor or breakpoints set in the nested type
editor show up.

1. Open type in AbstractTextEditor (from the binary plug-in).
2. Set a breakpoint anywhere in the file.
3. Open type on ActivationCodeTrigger. A separate editor opens for
AbstractTextEditor$ActivationCodeTrigger.
4. The breakpoint from step 2 does not appear.

Opening another editor for a nested type is not ideal and we should revisit 
this in JDT text. However, this cannot happen for 2.1.

Is there anything Debug can do to facilitate this? I thought we just
create a marker. Isn't it the nested type editor's responsibility to
render the markers from the resource of the enclosing type?
I believe this is up to JUI/Text. Breakpoints in outer types only appear on the 
outer type editor (for class files), and breakpoints on inner types only appear 
in the editor for the inner type. This is due to the fact that the breakpoint 
marker has an association with a specific type.

Moving to JUI.
This has been fixed a while ago.
