Pressing CTRL in the editor results in two actions:
- link-like navigation
- show code in hover

It would be better if the two features are separated
not true: there are much more:
- code assist (Ctrl+SPACE)
- quick fix (Ctrl+1)

Renaming PR

There's nothing new introduced regarding hovers: hovers always came even when
the Ctrl key was pressed. New is:
- you can configure the hovers now
- the Ctrl hover shows the source instead of the Javadoc

I also did not like the link behavior on Ctrl because in the first versions the
behavior was activated when I used code assist or quick fix and the mouse was
somewhere else. This has now been fixed.

It's now user configurable.
