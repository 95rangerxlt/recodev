I am using Aegis which produces files having the extension ',D', e.g.
'MyClass.java,D'.

I want to ignore these files from being shown in the Package Explorer. I tried
the filter in

Project - Properties - Java Build Path - Source - Exclusion Filter

but failed. I tried

**/*,D
**/*.java,D
**/*.java?D

without success. Seems as if this filter only ignores .java files. The only help
I found was the filter for 'non-java elements', but then my .properties files
disappear, too.

The Source exclusion filter is just here to exclude files from the build path. 

The functionality to use would be the Package Explorer filter (little triangle 
on the top of the Package Explorer view) and define a name filter "*.java,D".

However this doesn't work as this filter consider that ',' is a separator.

Moving to JDT/UI for comments.
Dani, can you please comment. Is there a way to escape the ','
No.
Other places follow that pattern as well. Need to offer to escape the ,

A possible workaround is to use

*.????D,*.?????D

which removes at least all files with 3- and 4-characters extension plus ',D'.
escape it with "," i.e. type ",," to enter a ',' as part of a filter.
