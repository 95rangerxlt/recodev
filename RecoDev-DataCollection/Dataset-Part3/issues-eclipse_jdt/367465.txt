When exporting to a Runnable Jar file with Library Handling option "Extract required libraries into the generated JAR", a warning dialog box appears that begins with "This operation repacks referenced libraries. Please review the licenses associated...". There is a checkbox on the dialog to disable the message, but it has no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain a library jar file. I downloaded jdom-1.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.jdom.org/dist/binary/
2. Go to Project / Properties menu / Java Build Path / Libraries tab. 
3. Select Add Jars and select <download_dir>/jdom-1.1.2.jar
4. Select File > Export, then Java > Runnable Jar file
5. In Jar Export Window, select the following
 - Launch Configuration:  Select project being exported
 - Export Destination: Select folder and enter jar file name, e.g. myProgram,jar
 - Library Handling: Extract required libraries into the generated JAR
6. Click Finish ...warning will appear
7. Check "Do not show this message again"
8. Repeat steps 4-6. ...warning still appears.

I was able to reproduce this the first time. Then when (after) I did something with the package explorer, say open a project and tried it again, the dialog seemed to remember my choice and didn't appear after that.

I don't really know if it is not instantaneous and if there is something else that triggers the storage of the option. Moving to JDT/UI for confirmation and further investigation.

I can easily reproduce with the steps from comment 0.
