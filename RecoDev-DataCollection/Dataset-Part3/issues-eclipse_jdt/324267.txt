FUP of bug 48880

- Even with a fully qualified name in the clipboard (like:
"org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.Assert.isLegal(Assert.java:41)") user gets
prompted to choose between all Assert classes in the workspace.

- "org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert" reports the private constructor.

Problem is in OpenFromClipboardAction.java
