BETA_JAVA8

The introduction of default methods changes and adds some rules regarding
permissible modifiers on methods.

- admit strictfp and synchronized for default methods (bug 382353)
  (rules about static, native and final for interfaces methods are unchanged)

- report illegal combination of abstract and default (bug 382354)

AFAICS the two sub tasks bug 382353 and bug 382354 resolved all that is needed here.

Deeper analysis will happen in the context of bug 383966.
I've pushed an update via commit ad2b9e82c9aafa1082bb24fe4ac142c2def6633b to connect some loose ends:
- a clarification from bug 380194 comment 41
- one more test in AnnotationTests
- explicit link from the implementation (MethodScope.checkAndSetModifiersForMethod(..)) to the spec.
From sub-task bug 382353 comment 1:
> All tests have to be written as negative tests at this point to prevent class file verification while we don't yet have a JVM that accepts non-abstract interface methods.

In commit a99930ec8dcb92cbb9eb0aaf5469155cb8340d01 I've converted a first test into a positive test actually executing a default method. This passes on a lambda-8-b50 JRE.

Another test that still cannot run as a positive test is now tracked via bug 383608 comment 5.
