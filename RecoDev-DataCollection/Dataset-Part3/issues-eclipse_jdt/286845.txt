To fix bug 276294, JDT/Core added a new IProblem id called UnresolvedVariable

It replaces UndefinedName in cases where we know we have a varaible.

Quick fix likely needs to be updated.

Fix to restore original behavior

Released catch-up fix to restore original behavior.

Should look into LinkedNodeFinder#getProblemKind(IProblem) again, and add a special quick fix when AST is not complete.
Nothing more to do (i.e. no plans to provide a quick fix for this syntax error).
