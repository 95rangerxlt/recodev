Works for me using Eclipse 3.5 RC4.

I am using Ubutu 9.04 that comes with eclipse 3.2.2. I am sure that latter versions of eclipse didnot have this bug. It is also reported for some eralier versions. I can download the latest version from eclipse, but would rather keep the ubuntu instalation intact.

No recent reports.  Please reopen if still a problem.
Works for me in 3.7.2 and I20120103-0800, but fails in recent I-builds (I20120125-1800, I20120320-1400).
I can also reproduce this on win7:

Version: 4.2.0
Build id: I20120321-0610

a quick debug shows that the scrapbook snippet VM is not suspending on its 'magic' breakpoint, so we end up getting no thread (evaluation context).
Turns out the scrapbook VM was suspending, but once suspended, the frame we were looking for was on a different line than it used to be. Fixed in master:
