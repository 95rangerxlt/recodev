Using 0412, I found that the two options:
- show problems before compiling
- highlight 
problems

are rather confusing. I know that there are performance issues when computing 
problems while typing code. I unchecked "Highlight problems" to get rid of them, but no change. 
Unchecking the first option fixed the problem. I got closer to good performances, but I found that 
typing inside big files (> 400Ko) is still slow. I can wait before I see the characters I am typing to 
show up in the editor.
So I think the first option should rather be:
- show problems while 
editing.
And I don't see why we have a second option. If we don't want to show problems, why would 
we spend time computing them?

fixed in 20020416, problems are no longer computed when setting is off
