"Delete the import declarations by selecting them in the Outline view ..."

but they aren't there anymore. This was mentioned in a forum post, 28.11.2012, where Dani Megert promptly replied, saying they're now hidden by default and requesting a bug be filed against the doc. I just ran into this in build 4.3.0.M20130911-1000. I couldn't find a bug, so I'm filing one.
