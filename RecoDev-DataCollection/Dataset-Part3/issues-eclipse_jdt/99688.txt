In RC2.  Project attached.

I'm having problems minimizing this report--it seems to be dependent on a number
of factors.  Import the attached project, and try to Use Supertype where
Possible on TransactionList, converting it to ArrayList<E>.  The only change
made is to AccountantTests, where the following line gets added to the imports:

import ArrayList<Transaction>.DateComparison;

David, can you please attach the project.

The project that exposes the bug

Sorry--here it is.
This is probably due to the optimization introduced just before RC2 which used 
BindingKeyParser to generate the import.

Needs to be investigated.
