I've always disabled the Java editor preference to report problems as I type.
After enabling spell checking, the java editor doesn't show spell checking
problems unless this preference is enabled. I would like to use spell checking
without having to enable this preference.

The spell checker reports problems which you desired not to report ;-) This
works like that since 3.0. However, it's a bigger problem now that the spell
checker is set on the general preference page and the connection might no longer
be obvious to the user.

I've always assumed that even if 'report problems as you type' was disabled, the
problems would be reported when the file is saved. You are saying that if you
disable 'report as you type' certain classes of problems are not reported? How
am I supposed to know that?

They are reported by the builder as markers and if auto-build is enabled then
yes, they appear upon save.

Yes, but only while typing, as the preference indicates.

I guess the main confusing thing here is that there's currently no builder for
which creates spelling problem markers that are persistent.

Fixed in HEAD.
