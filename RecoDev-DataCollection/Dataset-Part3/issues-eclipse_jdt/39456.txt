Heya.  1 usability issue:

While java editing, choosing 'Extract Interface' presents a dialog: 'Please
select the class name to extract an interface'.  Perhaps the choice should not
be available if the class name is not selected, or perhaps the class name should
be resolved from the current position within the editor.  It's not a huge
problem, but getting rid of the dialog and the time in reckognizing, cancelling,
choosing the class name and re-choosing to extract interface would be saved,
speeding development.  Its far better to never let an error happen than to have
the user deal with one when it does.  There may be other menu choices that
suffer from the same condition.  

Again, keep up the great work.

This works now.
