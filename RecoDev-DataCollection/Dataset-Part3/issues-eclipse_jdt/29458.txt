When I have an existing constructor within a class, which has a single line 
comment and I attempt to convert this comment to a multi lie comment, it 
inserts the 'typecomment' tempalte. In addition, the comment is not correctly 
indented.

For example:

before:
/**
 * My typecomment
 */
public class MyClass {
    /** my constructor */
    public MyClass() {
    }
}

after (placing cursor before 'my contructor' and hitting enter):
/**
 * My typecomment
 */
public class MyClass {
    /** 
 * My typecomment
 */ my constructor */
    public MyClass() {
    }
}
