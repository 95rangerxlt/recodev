fMessage= " " + JavaUIMessages.TypeInfoViewer_separator_message + " ";
Besides TypeInfoViewer there are also non-NLSed strings in:
- MoveInnerToTopRefactoring
- JavaAddElementFromHistoryImpl

Martin I fixed the Type info viewer.
Fix for TypeInfoViewer will be included in I20050509-2000.
Fixed JavaAddElementFromHistoryImpl and verified that we have no other
externalized strings.

Andr√©, you might want to review my changes.
Dani, change was OK. Thanks!
