1. Open AboutDialog.java
2. In the editor select the method 'actionPerformed' from the anonymous 
ActionListener.
3. Press CTRL + H
4. The search dialog shows:
junit.awtui.AboutDialog.1..actionPerformed(ActionEvent)

Looks weird.

We should render a better name in this case. Something like new TypeName() 
{...}. But we have to talk to JDT/Core what a user has to enter for anonymous 
types if the name isn't taken from a selection.
JDT/Core doesn't support searching an anonymous type from its string 
representation. We didn't find any easy way to represent an anonymous type. 
We're open to suggestions.
Opening the search dialog from the outliner gives:

junit.swingui.AboutDialog.1.actionPerformed(ActionEvent)

Search for: Method/reference

Opening the search dialog from the editor with actionPerformed selected gives

actionPerformed

Search for Type/references

We should improve the name (e.g AboutDialog.1.actionPerformed) and should 
default to a method search when selected from the editor.
fixed > 20050203

we use now the same label as in outline (new Anonym() { .. })
