Eclipse 3.0 is planning to support non-Java partitions in the Java editors.  
Currently you can only define java or javadoc templates.  I would like to be 
able to define a new template type different from java or javadoc which could 
be used in a new non-Java partition.   For example, I would like to define a 
template of type SQLJ that would contain a template for a valid #sql clause.

This is now possible with the org.eclipse.ui.editors.templates extension point.
Any editor may choose to support a specific context type (which map to
partitions in many ways), and can offer contributed templates, or even template
resolvers if it chooses so.

The java editor currently does not support any other context types, but it does
not support other languages either.
