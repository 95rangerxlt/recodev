When I have:

/** The particular AIS ID this processor listens for. */

That I want to turn into:

/** 
 * The particular AIS ID this processor listens for. 
 */

I type ENTER <HERE>:

/**<HERE> The particular AIS ID this processor listens for. */

I get:

	/**
	 * 
	 */ The particular AIS ID this processor listens for. */

That's not right!

This only happens for me when the comment is the final line in the source 
file. (i.e. there are no lines after the comment). If there is even a single 
blank line after the comment, I get the correct behaviour when I press enter. 

Also, doing an undo after this bad transformation also has problems because it 
takes TWO undos to get back to how things were before enter was pressed, 
instead of just a single undo.
Looks like this is resolved in 3.1M4...
Yes, this got fixed some time ago. Thanks.
