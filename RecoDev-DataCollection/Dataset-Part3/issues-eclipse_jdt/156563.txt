Build id:M20060629-1905

Java:
JAVA_HOME=/opt/ibm-java/ibm-java2-i386-50

When creating a class that implements Serializable, the warning appears:

The serializable class ... does not declare a static final serialVersionUID of type long.  Using QuickFix, if you choose "Add generated serialVersionUID" it adds:

	/**
	 * 
	 */
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 0L;

This has worked in the past, but is not working now.  I have not changed versions of java.  I see that this has been a problem in the past, and some people have not been able to reproduce it, while others have.

Assigning over to UI.

I can confirm this is happening on Windows XP as well, though in my case I'm getting 1L instead of the generated serialVersionUID.

This has worked in the past for me as well.
