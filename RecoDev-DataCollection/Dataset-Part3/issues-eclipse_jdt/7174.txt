A hot key to jump to the matching brace/bracket/paren would be nice. MSVC uses 
Ctrl-[

It is a little hard to find brace problems in the editor currently. If you have 
an extra } at the bottom of the class it is hard to tell where you accidentally 
deleted } in the code above. Double clicking to highlight the braced area works 
but is slow.

I don't know when it was added, but this functionality exists (2.1 RC1): 
Navigate->Go To->Matching Bracket.

It is mapped to Ctrl+Shift+P, but I've successfully mapped it to Ctrl+[.

Two suggestions:
1. Change the default binding to Ctrl+[ (IMHO this would be a better mnemonic)
2. Select the matching bracket, this makes it easier to quickly see which
bracket it jumped to.

(This maybe should be its own report, but it's closely related so I'll post it
here.)

It would also be nice to have an action for "select to matching bracket", with a
default binding to Ctrl+Shift+[.  When matching against curly braces, it would
include the braces in the select text, for others (like square brackets, parens,
etc.) it would exclude the brackets in the selected text.


Please don't use Ctrl-[ or ] as shortcuts.
All keyboards in the world are not US keyboards.
Characters like [ | \ # { must be accessed with AltGr key on French keyboards, and probably others.
This is implemented since 2.1
We won't change the key binding to use '[' and/or ']' (for reasons see comment 7).
