Build 3.2M5

When typing following code in editor (without building), there is no error indication in left ruler, where one appears when building.

public class X {
	{
		(a
	}
}

Note that if removing the open parenthesis, the error icon appears as expected.

This is by design and in since day one: we only show an icon in the vertical ruler for temporary problems if we think there might be a quick fix and then show the corresponding quick fix icon. Note that we indicate it in the text and the overview ruler though.
What's interesting, though, is that those 2 characters induce 5 syntax errors ;-)
Well, if I am building, then I see an error icon... not if I am reconciling. Isn't this inconsistent ?
The main point behind the current design decision is/was:
1. if we would add an icon, people would also want the icon to be 
   shown on views (Outline, Package Explorer and notably Problems view), 
   basically everywhere where the normal/build problem icons appear. However, 
   doing this is be a performance problem.

2. you still see the error in the source and in the overview ruler

3. in order to distinguish temporary problems from build problems (and of course
   from quick fixable one, we'd have to invent yet another icon

4. yes, we knew that there would be the inconsistency you see, but we decided
   that this is not a big deal and given the fact that since 2.0 where J Core
   started to report temporary problems we did not get a single PR up to now 
   probably proofs us right

Note that another inconsistency causes much more reaction/PRs from the community: they often miss the temporary problems in the Problems view.
Fair enough, if it is a 2.0 behavior. Still inconsistent, but not a regression.
We should address this now that almost all temporary problems have icons due to the fact that they have a quick fix.

Early 3.4 we should just show the normal icons and order artwork for a temporary warning and error.

NOTE: we should probably do the same for the task tag icon.
