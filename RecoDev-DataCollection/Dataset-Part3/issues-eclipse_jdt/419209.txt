The spec says:

It is a compile-time error if a declaration is annotated with any annotations of
a repeatable annotation type T and more than one annotation of the containing
annotation type of T.

Assuming FooContainer is itself a repeatable annotation type with a containing
annotation type of FooContainerContainer, one might expect the following code to be legal:

@Foo(1) @FooContainer({@Foo(2)}) @FooContainer({@Foo(3)}) class A {}

But this code is allowed by eclipse compiler.

Fix for this issue

I've fixed this now, had to add yet another problem message.

By the way, I'm seeing unrelated errors when running RunAllJava8Tests (against b108):

I just disabled these. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417659#c8.

These tests pass for me with 8b108. Could you investigate a bit more and
see what this unexpected error is about ? 

BTW, I had to resort to shutting down the VM and restarting it for these
tests: See the comment: 
// Not sure, unless we force the VM to not be reused by passing dummy vm argument, the generated program aborts midway through its execution

Not sure, may be your VM does not like the dummy argument ?

I am Windows 64 bits.
Patch looks good. I made the following changes:

1. Added one more test.
2. Renamed checkForInstancesOfRepeatableWithRepeatingContaining to be 
checkForInstancesOfRepeatableWithRepeatingContainerAnnotation so it is
consistent with IProblem and the other methods
3. Mildly reworded the javadoc of this method

and released here:
http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=72dcd4b854d317f3c3f9226ee2c9a6583e0ff5db.

Thanks Jesper. Looks like javac does not implement this yet,

These exact two tests are failing for me, too (on Linux with 8b108).
The output is
  "Error: Could not find or load main class"
which I also get on the command line when calling
$ /home/local/java/jdk1.8.0/bin/java -verify "" X

It's indeed the empty argument that screws up the VM (and I'd suspect that bogus commandline processing in windows simply swallows the empty argument).

Simplest fix is to change "" into s.t. legal like "-server" or "-Ddummy".

If pushed a fix via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler/src/org/eclipse/jdt/core/tests/compiler/regression?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=093ab4b3428c0cfbf5dcade43c17848dfc0c032d

Hope, it works an all platforms ...

Windows64 - changes look good. Thanks.
