I am running Linux Mandrake 10.0, kernel 2.6.3

using KDE 3.2 
I experience a bug in content assist: after pressing ctrl-space in a java editor,
the dropdown list opens but has no selection on the first line (see screenshot)
I neet to press the TAB key to get the selection ! 
note that I press say arrow-down twice and then tab, the selection will show on
the third element of the dropdown list

using GNOME 2.4 - it works as expected - see screenshots

Got Help from the newsgroups:

OK, the culprit was a setting in the KDE set colors panel
that was checked by default - apply colors to non-KDE applications.
now that I unchecked it - the eclipse workbench window border has the
decorations painted like all other apps,
but the widgets internally (eg editor borders etc) are painted in a different
color - and the content assist dropdown is - surprise ;- rendered using the same
colors as in gnome (GTK).
