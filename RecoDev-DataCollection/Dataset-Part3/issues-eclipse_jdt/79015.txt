JFace includes constants for UI sizes in terms of dialog units.  Using dialog
units for button height has proved problematic on platforms such as the Mac and
Linux/GTK+ where themes like to do really fancy buttons with lots of padding. 
For some background, see bug 68568, bug 73730, and bug 78925.

We have stopped using IDialogConstants.BUTTON_HEIGHT in the platform UI code, so
I would like to get it removed elsewhere.  Attached is a patch to stop using it
in the JDT UI code.
