The spelling quick fix "Ignore xx during current session" does not work when invoked from the rich problem hover. Works fine via Ctrl+1. Nothing in the log.

The spelling quick fix "Ignore xx during current session" does not work when invoked from the rich problem hover. Works fine via Ctrl+1. Nothing in the log.
Actually, it does work, but the word is not immediately ignored in the current editor (annotation does not go away until the next reconcile).
Good catch (can also be a problem for other quick fixes).

Fixed in HEAD.
