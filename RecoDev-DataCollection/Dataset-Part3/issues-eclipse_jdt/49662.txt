In the formatter configuration (M6 build), on the Braces page, there is no 
option to configure the brace position on array initializers.

There is, however, an array initializers on that page's preview panel.

None of the existing options configure the array initializer on the preview 
pane, so I am hoping that this option will be added, but is currently missing.

I really would like to have this option - I don't think it really fits into 
any of the existing settings.

I have all of these options configured to "Next line" - but none of them 
reformat the brace position in array initializers in code.

OK, just checked the latest nightly build (N20040107), and the option is now 
there.

However, it does not correctly position the curly braces. In the code 
formatter, although I have now configured 'next line' for array initialiser, 
the formatter places the closing curly brace on the same line as the last 
array element.

During edits, caret positioning with 'next line' turned on does not place 
opening and closing braces correctly. They end up in different columns to 
eachother (in my configuration, the caret is positioning for the open curly 
brace at an indentation level that *should* drop back one level when the brace 
is typed - as it does with class/method braces etc.

int[] b = new int[]
                  {
};

int[] b = 
   {
};


Sorry, I have worded my last comment badly.

Essentially what I am trying to say is that the open curly brace is 
not 'outdented' when I key it during array initialisers where it does with 
class/method/etc blocks.

ie the caret positions at an indented level after pressing [Enter] and 
outdents when the curly brace is typed - and this is what is *not* happening 
on array initialisers.

Now I have played more with N20040107, I think this is the only facet of this 
issue that is outstanding. 

Apologies for any confusion!
fixed the auto-indentation part of this. Note that there is no real support in
the formatter for putting the opening brace on a new line. Please file an
enhancement request with jdt-core if you would like to do this.
