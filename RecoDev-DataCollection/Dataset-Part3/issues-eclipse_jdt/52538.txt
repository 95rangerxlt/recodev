The problem is a little convoluted, but I think it boils down to the 
following.  Selecting a token by double-clicking fails to update the insertion 
position.

Here is a test case that is continually annoying me.  

   public static final String FOO = null;
   public static final String BAR = null;

1.  Make sure to have something in your clipboard, ready to paste. (optional?)
2.  Double-click on the null value of FOO, highlighting it.  
3.  Enter a double-quote character, its matching pair will be automatically 
inserted.  
4.  Paste (now you should have FOO = "whatever";
5.  Immediately repeat the same steps for BAR, but notice that as soon as you 
enter a double-quote, it (and it's matching pair) is inserted after the 
closing double-quote of the FOO value instead.

PS - This is behavior observed in MS6

This has been fixed for M7
