I'd like to request changing the method visibility of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.AnonymousTypeCompletionProposal.getImageForType(IType) from private to protected. 

This change would allow us to significantly improve the performance of several completion scenarios. I'd be happy if the JDT team would accept these changes.

The patches will be contributed via Gerrit.
