There are many usefull extensions for the code completion available but all of 
them are like hard core hacks in the system. Doclethelp for example use an 
class overlay of the javadoc completion parser.

It would be fine if the code-completion feature could be pluggable. The could 
be one extension point which can be used by other plugins to register there own 
Code-Completion Parser. This can be done with an Context (Javadoc, Java, ..) 
and it can depend on the Editor.ID.

Integration of several Code-Completion Parser would be very easy and without 
doing dangerous things like class-overlay.

The feature shouldn't be to hard to implement. Please let me know if you want 
me to provide you with an Beta Version.

This has been fixed a while ago.
