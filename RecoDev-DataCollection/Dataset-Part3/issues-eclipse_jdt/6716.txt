Yet the Run icon (running man)is associated with the class.
Usability Issue:
woops, committed too early...
Usability Issues:
A: I expect to see Execution Arguments associated with the class, not the file
 a) because that is what I usually execute (the class)
 b) that is where the Running man icon is shown
 c) Run Button is associated with class not 

B: with only files visible in package view, I cannot determine which are the 
executable files - the running man icon is hidden within the expansion to the 
class level



Somewhat related to http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5858
although not DEBUG related

In addition
Properties View within perspective should refelct editable 
properties/categories that are visible in properties dialog access through 
package view

This File properties in dialog (especially execution arguments) should be 
accessable through properties View in perspective

The launching is currently in transition and we will move to a launching model 
based on "launch configurations" (http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/platform-
debug-dev/msg00018.html). In the new model execution arguments will no longer 
be attached to a file.

OK to close?
TO be fixed through launcher as above
