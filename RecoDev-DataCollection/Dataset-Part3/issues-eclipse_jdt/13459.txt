Not sure if this is Platform UI or JDT UI.

- type a line of code
- type space after the ; and then type // and a comment
- decide that you would rather have a tab than a space,
  so select the space, and type tab

You code shifts right by one tab?
This is marginally acceptable behavior when the selected text is at the 
beginning of a line, but it is completely unacceptable when the selection is in 
the middle of a line of code. Please make normal editor behavior apply here, 
i.e. I would have expected the typed tab to simply replace the selected space.

we have changed this behaviour based on community feedback.

I don't understand - do you mean you change it to *do* this?
Or do you mean that you have just changed it *not* to do this, and I will see 
the change in a newer drop?

If it's the former, do you mean to tell me that the community actually *wants* 
this extremely bogus behavior? If you are telling me yes (which I find hard to 
believe... i.e. what community?) then I need to know how to turn it off.
Customers have requested improved tabbing behavior - similar to what is 
implemented.  Textpad implements similar behavior as well. I believe the 
implementation is Textpad is closer to what we want:  If the selection is is > 
1 line, then it does the indent/outdent; if it is no selection or on a single 
line, it does replace with tab.
Ah, thank-you. That sounds better.
Agree with John - if multiple lines selected, go ahead and shift.
But if I want to select something on one line and replace with tab,
please let me replace with tab.
we have no problem changing it, but this wasn't the spec we got in the 
community feedback.
Changed behavior to multiline selection.
