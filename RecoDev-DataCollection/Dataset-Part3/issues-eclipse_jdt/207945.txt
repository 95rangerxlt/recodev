The Call Hierarchy on initializer should at least have one caller. Currently it only shows the explicit constructors. In case when there's none we should show the synthetic 0-arg constructor

I find it strange to say that a initializer is called by a constructor at all.
Not sure if adding a synthetic constructor here makes anything clearer.

Right, that's another discussion. I had the same feeling.
Fixed in HEAD with patch for bug 207946.
Constructors are not callers of initializers any more.
