Some DOM/AST Javadocs like MethodDeclaration have become quite hard to read, because they start with outdated grammar rules. The corresponding API methods are already deprecated, and the old grammar doesn't matter any more.

Any opposition to removing the outdated grammar and just leaving the current version?

Marked all APIs for deprecated language constructs as deprecated, added "(added in JLSx API)" etc. where missing, and removed outdated grammar.
