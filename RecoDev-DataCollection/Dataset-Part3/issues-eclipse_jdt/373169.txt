In 'New Java Class' wizard, dialog 'Implemented Interfaces Selection' normally does not allow to select an annotation type. But an annotation type worms its way into history section of this dialog, after it was selected in 'Enclosing Type Selection' dialog. While an annotation type is in its history, 'Implemented Interfaces Selection' dialog considers it as a valid option, so that finally 'New Java Class' wizard successfully creates Java class implementing an annotation type (with a warning 'The annotation type {0} should not be used as a superinterface for {1}).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Java project, and an annotation type MyAnnotation in it.
2. Open 'New Java Class' wizard.
3. Click 'Add...' button at 'Interfaces' input - 'Implemented Interfaces Selection' dialog appears.
4. Make sure that there is no way to select MyAnnotation in it. That is ok.
5. Check 'Enclosing type' input and click 'Browse...' button to the right of it - 'Enclosing Type Selection' dialog appears. Select MyAnnotation in it and click 'OK' - 'Enclosing type' is populated. That is ok.
6. Repeat step 3. ('New Java Class' wizard may be reopened, that does not matter).
7. Make sure that MyAnnotation now is present in History section, and can be selected as valid option. That is a bug.

Thanks for the clear steps.

Apart from the wrong handling of history elements, there was also a missing API constant IJavaElementSearchConstants.CONSIDER_INTERFACES_AND_ANNOTATIONS for clients of JavaUI#createTypeDialog(..).
