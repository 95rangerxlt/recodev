Actually the summary is backwards.  The bug is that the double-click to 
activate the quickfix (whose presence is signaled by an icon) also sets a 
breakpoint.  Obviously you don't want it to do that. 
 
Possible solutions: 
1 - just have double-click activate quickfix 
2 - make quickfix single-click instead 
 
With #2, what to do with breakpoint setting is still up for discussion.  I am 
somewhat uncomfortable with being able to set a breakpoint while it's going to 
be hidden behind the quickfix icon.  I don't think it makes that much sense to 
let people set a breakpoint on a line with broken syntax anyway.  They should 
fix the code first before setting a breakpoint IMO. 
There are investigations being made for M4 - from the Text plan:
- investigate improved support for annotation hovering and interaction

I've fixed this during 3.2.
