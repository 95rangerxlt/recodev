We must support the extension to the language model API - specifically javax.lang.model.AnnotatedConstruct.getAnnotationsByType(Class<A>) - in order to support annotation processing of repeated annotations.

Jesper, if it alright with you, I would like to take a crack at this
tomorrow: Having just reviewed the work for javax.lang.model related
changes for JSR308, I feel I can quickly wrap this up even while code
generation work is progressing in parallel under your stewardship.

Basically I plan to proceed under the assumption that type bindings
originating from source constructs will have repeated annotations and
the ones from binaries will have container annotations and plan to
create a virtual reality for annotation processors that would match
the spec.

Which leads me to one question: When the container annotation is explicitly
used in the code, how will AnnotatedConstruct.getAnnotationByType() know
that it should not unwrap the contained annotations ? I don't know the
answer, but will investigate.

I hope this proposal for me to grab this task is alright with you.

javac could show the way, but my hunch is that is no way to tell. One way of fixing: Have both. Another: Always prefer repeated or container. I don't see a clear winner.

Yes, absolutely
Great, thanks!
