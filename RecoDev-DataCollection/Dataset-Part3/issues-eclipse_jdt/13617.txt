Build 20020409

- new Java class Test
- insert method:
public void run() {
}
- replace void with voyd by replacing i with y (cursor should be positions 
after y)
- save (with autobuild on)
- it finds the problem and displays it in the ruler, shows squiggles, and adds 
it to the task list
- however, it is not shown in the status line

- hit Ctrl+E
- it has no effect

- move the cursor outside the squiggle
- hit Ctrl+E again
- now it works and the status line updates

- place the cursor above this line
- hit Ctrl+E
- it repositions on the error, but the status line is blank

The status line should always show the error when Next/Prev Problem is used.
Also, it would be good if it showed the error whenever the cursor entered an 
error range.

This is important for accessibility and general usability.
Recommend bumping up priority.

Can this be considered for 2.1?
Thanks

There are two features/bugs described here
a) show problem text when caret is inside problem annotation
b) currently we do not jump to the annotation that encloses the caret since we
assume you don't want to jump to the already existing position.

We can fix this PR by
- implementing a)
- implementing b) i.e. select the annotation which contains the caret as well
- implement both


Fixed next/prev navigation:
- if caret is enclosed then select enclosing annotation
- if there's only one annotation then use this one i.e. don't clear status line
