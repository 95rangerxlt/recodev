"Clean Up on Save" is a global setting, but sometimes, I edit a file and I do not want to clean it up. Currently, I have to
- undo all applied clean ups individually,
- hunt for the preference page,
- disable the save participant,
- save,
- enable the preference again.

I think a good way to streamline this use case would be to combine the Clean Up on Save changes in a single undo operation. The undo should revert all Clean Ups and leave the file saved.

>- undo all applied clean ups individually,
Verified with Markus that this isn't true but the menu label could give that impression (it shows the last clean up).

Benno, we already talked about this.
Definitely a must, but sorry, I have to move it...
