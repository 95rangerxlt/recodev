The Refactor/Change Method Signature dialog does not wrap the Method Signature
Preview. The only way to view the whole preview is to resize the dialog
horizontally. 

It would be better if perhaps the "Method Signature Preview" were on one line
and the actual preview be in a read-only text area rectangle which would wrap
its contents.
