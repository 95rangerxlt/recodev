It would be go to see that Eclipse 3.5 supports the latest version of JUnit -- instead of waiting until June 2010 when the next major release will be shipped.

Looks too late to get the CQ approved for inclusion in 3.5.

JUnit has just released version 4.7. New CQ:
https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3480
Fixed in HEAD for next I-build.

Besides the changes in org.junit4, I also released a fix to org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.buildpath.P2Utils that ensures that the JUnit container takes the latest available version of org.junit4, not just any of them.

I could not update the Javadoc URL in JunitPreferenceInitializer, since junit.org still doesn't provide updated Javadocs.
