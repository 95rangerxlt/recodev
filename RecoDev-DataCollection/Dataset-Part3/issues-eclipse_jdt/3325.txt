Step to reproduce
	1) write this code :
		Set s;
		s.toArr
	2) do Ctrl + Space (to do code assist)

	result is
		toArray() Object [] - Collection
		toArray() Object [] - Set
		toArray(Object []) Object [] - Collection
		toArray(Object []) Object [] - Set
	
	There is too much match.
	Collection is superinterface of Set.
