When using 3.1 with JDK 1.5, with a project that uses 1.4 JRE and 
compatibility, and getting assist for a class that became a generic in 1.5, the 
text that is pasted in is using generics syntax nevertheless.

TIA. Regards,

Works for me using I20050315-0800.
I might have used a different scenario. Please provide more detailed steps to
reproduce. See also:
http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-text-home/development/bug-incomplete.htm

Found this case:

- JRE 5 installed, source compliance set to 1.4. 
- have this code:

import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class X {
  void m() {
    List list= new ArrayL|
  }
}

- enable the Java>Editor>Code Assist>Fill argument names preference
- invoke content assist at the caret (|) location

the inserted code is 'ArrayList<E>'

I think that if the JRE used by the project is 1.4, it works fine.
However if the JRE is 1.5 and compatibility 1.4, then one gets 1.5 style 
suggestions.

fix is ready.
