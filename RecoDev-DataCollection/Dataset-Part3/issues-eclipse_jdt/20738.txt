JavaDOC tool will not generate javadoc for anonymous inner classes.  In an 
anonymous inner class, when I override a method, a "@see super.impl()" gets 
inserted.  I feel that this is unnecessary.  Maybe some comment is nice to have 
for people reading the code, but anonymous classes are often simple enough to 
have no comments.

You can disable adding java doc comments in the preferences (Java->Code 
Generation). But this is currently a "all or nothing" switch.
this is fixed in M2: No comments generated for methods for anonymous classes
