I20031008

The tree dialog created by the (Properties) Browse button in the NLS Keys search
page is not purely alphabetical.  It seems to be ordering based on whether the
project is a source or a binary import project, and within those groups further
ordered alphabetically.  This is confusing.  A quick look tells me that there is
some kind of alphabetical sorting going on so I head to the bottom of the list
thinking th project will be there (based on name) yet it isn't.  I have to
navigate the entire tree to find my project.
