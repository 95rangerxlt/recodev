When using code assist in the find/replace dialog, a space is inserted first,
then removed and the code assist window appears. The add-remove does not happen
in the type wizard.

It also would be good if no space is added when 'regular expression' is not
enabled. Either nothing should happen, or maybe present the reg-exp options
always and turn on the 'reg-exp' option when the user chooses a proposal.

The space comes from my hand-crafted key handler. This will go away once we have
better key binding support.
Reopening to mark as fixed.
Fixed in head.
