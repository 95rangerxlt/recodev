Build 3.4M6

APT markers should be stamped with a IMarker.SOURCE_ID attribute (e.g. JavaProject#createClasspathProblemMarkers(...)).

In JDT/Core, we use the string "JDT". You could use the same I think, or something identifying annotation processing ? up to you.

This attribute allows to trace marker origins.

Fixed for 3.4M7.  We now stamp all APT-created markers with SOURCE_ID of "APT".  This does not include APT compilation problems (e.g., problems contributed by annotation processors), which are tracked by JDT, rather than APT; it does include markers for things like missing processor libraries, build problems, etc.
