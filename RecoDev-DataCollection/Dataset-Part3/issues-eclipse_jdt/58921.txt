Daniel, they should be both in your land...
Isn't it possible to create a text Text widget with flat look?
Appearing flat, or at least a platform's best attempt at this, is the default 
behaviour for Texts with no style specified (as opposed to specifying 
SWT.BORDER).  SWT.FLAT isn't a utilized style bit though.

Thanks. Good catch.
