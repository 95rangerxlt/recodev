Create a new Java project A, set src/ as source folder and bin/ as bin folder.
Create a class test.foo.Foo.
Share project.
The resulting sync view shows that folders A/bin/test and A/bin/test/foo are
candidates for releasing, meaning they are not marked as derived. The file
Foo.java is correctly marked as derived.

I understood that these folders should now be marked as derived.

This will be resolved for next thurday build.
This change was released yesterday & should be in today's integration build.
