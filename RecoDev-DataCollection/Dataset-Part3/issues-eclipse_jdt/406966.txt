Jesper, Many thanks for offering to be the implementation lead for this 
project !

Please read the relevant documents and spawn off ERs/CRs for unit level tasks
and link them as blockers to this ER. I am available for consultation and code
reviews.

Let us use this bug as the umbrella ER for this project, patches should go
to task level bugzilla entries. For reviews, patches at task level is preferred
rather than one big glob of a patch - you can always suggest the review order
if there are dependencies.
I've split JEP120 off into bug 407864, for ease of reference.
All the subtasks are now complete enough at this stage, so I think we may declare JEP 118 'done'.
