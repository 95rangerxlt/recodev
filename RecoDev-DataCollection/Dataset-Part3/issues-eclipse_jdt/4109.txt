JAR Packager: Fix trailing spaces workaround in seal label
	The "normal" label does not clear the characters which are behind the new string:
	e.g. existing label "abcd" is replaced with "xy" --> "xycd"

	Verify if this is an SWT bug. If so, file a PR. Eventually use a smart label (like status line).
