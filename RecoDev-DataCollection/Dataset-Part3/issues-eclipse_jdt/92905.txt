build I20050426-1700

- switched to new build
- used Ctrl+Shift+T
- it appeared unresponsive for several seconds (though CPU usage went up), then
the "Checking model consistency..." dialog came up and did work for a while
- should bring up the dialog sooner, or show the busy cursor if this is not possible

Fixed. Problem was that I create the workspace scope to early which takes some
time. I am now creating it inside the runnable.
Marking as fixed.
