To reproduce the bug, create a string and externalize it. If you now delete the key value pair in the respective properties file and then hover the externalized string you will get a warning saying the key is missing. This works fine if the properties file is not empty. If it is empty, no hover is displayed.

The code that prevents the hover to appear in this case can be found in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.hover.NLSStringHover line 111 

Properties properties= NLSHintHelper.getProperties(propertiesFile);
		if (properties == null || properties.isEmpty())
			return null;

In case the properties file is empty a warning should be returned rather than null.
