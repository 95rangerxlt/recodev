Fix

Follow-up to bug 392847.

AdvancedQuickAssistProcessor.getConvertIfElseToSwitchProposals has more bugs, e.g.
- NPE for:
		if (equals("a")) {

- coverts this (left operand neither a String nor a primitive, nor an enum):
		if (this.equals("a")) {

The patch fixes these problems but is missing tests.

Ha! Didn't think of this case.
Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=f981ac7c0bb812e92f6f26b4de012b65550b5aa5

Also made the inner loop understandable by moving the constant check
"currentIf != null" out of the while expression.
