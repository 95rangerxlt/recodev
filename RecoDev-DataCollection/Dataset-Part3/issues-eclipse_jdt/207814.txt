Build ID: I20070921-0919

Steps To Reproduce:
With automatic folding of Inner types (Java>Editor>Folding), and assuming JRE source code is attached:
1. Open java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
2. Go to releaseShared() method and ctrl-T on tryReleaseShared() method call
3. Choose java.util.concurrent.Semaphore.Sync

Editor jumps past the class definition of Sync.  Ideally, it would automatically expand the class and jump to the correct method.

OK, this is a mess:
1. it only works when range indication is enabled
2. works for those cases where the range indication changes
3. does unneeded expands in case only the member name needs to be selected (or to put it the other way: doesn't always expand the selected member.

For now I'll fix the problem that some inner elements aren't expanded. As consequence it will now always expand. To solve this we need new API that allows to expand all parents of a currently folded region.

Filed bug 217681 for not expanding if not needed.

Fixed in HEAD.
