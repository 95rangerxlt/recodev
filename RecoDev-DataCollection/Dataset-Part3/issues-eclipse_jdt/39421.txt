Color highlighting of task tags (TODO etc.) in JDT editors does not take into 
account project-level settings for tags, i.e. colorizing always uses global 
preferences (Preferences->Java->Task Tags), even if project properties 
(Properties->Java Task Tags) override these settings. Note, that task 
marker/task list generation works properly, so this is purely UI problem.

Removed bug 39478 as being blocked by this PR. The Java editor will read the
project options via IJavaProject.getOptions. There's no general platform
mechanism to get the project specific options.

Note: This might change when the new Settings API will be released (planned for
3.0).

Also a problem in 3.0.
Sure. That's why it is still open.
Solution is underway but would have been too intrusive to release shortly before
M7. Postponed.

Released Christof's patches.
