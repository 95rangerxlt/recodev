I find that most often, I can get no hoverhelp over an error in the left margin 
of the java editor. Sometimes I can. If I change the contents of the editor, 
that might affect whether or not I get hoverhelp. If I leave the editor and 
reopen it, that sometimes changes the behaviour. But once I lose the hoverhelp 
it's hard for me to ever get it back in that editor. I usually have to close 
the editor and reopen the file.

Workaround:
Move the mouse pointer to another location inside the vertical ruler.
Wait for 400 ms. Now move it over the error icon again. -> It's back.
