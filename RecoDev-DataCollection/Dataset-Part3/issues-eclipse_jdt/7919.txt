to hide it.

Suggest to add optional attribute (e.g. showScopeSection) to SearchPage-XML
which defaults to false.
This makes sense and let's do this. However, clients might one to use the space 
to show their custom scope mechanism.
XML is extended with optional tag "showScopeSection" which if false per default
Currently the space of the hidden scope part can't be reused. We decided not to
shrink the dialog if we switch to another page.

No action required for the help plug-in
