I was planning to implement this feature in my own editor, then I see that a move to Platform Text was planned for 3.1, now for 3.2. Since the 3.2 release is not very far away should I wait? If not, any pointers to examples?
We really hope to get this in for 3.2
The following is in 3.2 M5:
- quick fix/assist command, action setup and invocation pushed down to Platform 
  Text
- API for quick fix/assist is defined in Platform Text but there's no default
  implementation yet. This will follow in 3.2 M6
- a new extension point has been defined which will allow to contribute quick
  fixes and quick assists. For M5 this extension point is not yet processed. This
  will come with M6.

This part has to be deferred to 3.3 or even dropped, see bug 133339 for details.
