I have a vistor interface TransformationBindingVisitor with one method and a 
partial implementation of a method:

static void registerActions(TransformationManagerBinding 
transformationManagerBinding) {
		visitTransformationBindings(new TransformationBindingVisitor() {
		});
	} // registerActions

Compile the code causes an error, then I click on the red cross I do NOT get 
the suggestion to "Create the method..." which you normally get when other 
kinds of methods are missing.

Seems to work now. I assume TransformationManagerBinding and 
TransformationBindingVisitor are existing classes and that 
visitTransformationBindings does not exist yet: A quick fix is offered to 
create visitTransformationBindings(TransformationBindingVisitor v)

There was a fix for unresolved methods with anonymous classes as arguments.
