Cheetah04

When parsing the following program, the receiver of parameterized message send 
is incorrectly considered as being an implicit one, where it should be name 
ref "X".
      X.<String,X>foo("SUCCESS", null)

Testcase:

public class X {

	static <T, U> T foo(T t, U u) {
		return t;
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(X.<String,X>foo("SUCCESS", null));
	}
}

Added regression test: GenericTypeTest#test184.
I am investigating.
This is fixed and released in HEAD.
Regression test is reactivated.
