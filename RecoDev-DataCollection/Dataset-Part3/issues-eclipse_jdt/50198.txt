I20040113

I had the following code in a method:

Position p;
if (p.getOffset() > ) {do somethign}

I selected the if statement and copied it to another method that had
Position pp;

I then invoked quick fix on p and expected to get
"Rename to pp".

Unfortunately this was missing.

Perfect fix would be to detect local variables of same type :-)
