1. Open preferences.
2. Go to the Editor option.
3. Tab through the various preferences. The Bracket highlighting radio buttons come before any of the checkboxes above them. It should probably be made so it is consistent with the rest of the preference dialogs, i.e. so that the tab order has the higher up controls first.

I can reproduce the problem, however I do not see anything wrong in the JDT/UI code.

The radio buttons are new in 3.8 M6, and they are created in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.preferences.JavaEditorAppearanceConfigurationBlock.createAppearancePage(Composite)
Sorry I missed this when reviewing the code. This is how radio buttons work (see e.g. bug 181660 or bug 324048).

Fixed in master: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=c3edc193ed5031f375bb806aa94001799532594f

Ha! I didn't know that :-)

Thanks Dani!
