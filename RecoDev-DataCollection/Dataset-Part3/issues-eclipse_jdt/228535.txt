The UI is very confusing when you try to select destination for a JAR relative to the workspace. There is no GUI indication for it, the Browse button opens the OS file dialog. The way I found it is by searching bugzilla, which is suboptimal as a user guidance.

To get relative destination, the user is supposed to type (no dialog to help you select!) the destination without the leading "/" (for example "myproject/myjar.jar"). 
But this is very very unituitive, because on the second page of the wizard, relative destination (Description file) does use the leading "/" (for example "/myproject/myjar.desc")

When using 'Browse' to select a location inside the workspace, the dialog now automatically makes the path a relative workspace path.
I think this is what users want and inserts the path in the correct form

I've now found number of bugs for this problem, all marked as duplicates or resolved, and it still does not work, at least not on my  Version: 3.4.1 Build id: M20080911-1700.

Martin's comment below "I think this is what users want" seems to imply marked detachment from real world needs and expectations". Like several others have commented, we need to be able to specify the path:

1) relative to project directory 
2) as an absolute path
3) relative to workspace

Note that many, many, people, if not most, store all the files in the project outside the workspace, so the current way the path is resolved is not usable at all and we need to resort to absolute paths, which outside Windows C:/something -practice does not work well in team environments where your path is alway different from your co-workers.

Further, it is so totally wrong from the user interface design point of view that when I browse and show where the files should be stored this is interpreted relative to the workspace! What, why, how? Nobody in their right mind can expect this sort of behavior. If I browse it needs at very least resolve to absolute path, not relative, at least not relative to workspace. Come on, after so many years, lets please solve this issue. 

Let the user specify both absolute and project relative paths in the conventional way: absolute starts with '/' and relative pathsdo not. And relative needs to be resolved relative to the project directory structure, not something inside the workspace. 

 For those who need / want to specify workspace relative paths some special notation could be added.
