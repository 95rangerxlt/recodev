If I try to pull up a static method I get the error message:  
"To activate this refactoring, please select the name of a method".  
 
Pull up works if the method is made non-static, which is a feasible 
workaround since the method can be made static after pull-up. 
  
Test case: 
//Base.java  
public class Base {  
};  
class Sub extends Base {  
  public static void f() { // try to pull up 'f'.  
  }    
};

will improve the wording of the message
pull up i, by definition, available on instance methods
fixed
