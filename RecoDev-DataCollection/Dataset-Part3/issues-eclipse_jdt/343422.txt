3.6.

Generating Javadoc for CUs with 'UTF-8' names fails on Windows (where 'Cp1252' is the default encoding).

1. start new workspace
2. import project form attachment 193329
3. set project encoding to UTF-8
4. try to export Javadoc
==> fails because the file names are mangled

There's no way to fix this by using VM arguments or extra Javadoc program arguments because the options file is created using the encoding with which the workspace was launched and the '-encoding' parameter is not used when reading the options file.

If the encoding for the 'javadoc' command is specified using "-J-Dfile.encoding=MY_ENCODING" then we should use that to write the options file.
