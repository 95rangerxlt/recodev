In a present implementation of the Class Search Dialog, user have to wait 
before he can type the search query (class name), because of the search process 
(or indexing) is runned before dialog is shown. It will be much more convenient 
for the user if he can type while that indexing is runned in a background 
thread.

The information is cached so normally the dialog pops up fast. No action planned for 
2.1. The plan for 2.2 contains an item to do more stuff in background. 
Please note, that progress dialog appears after any refresh or adding 
resources/jars to the workspace. Progress bar also appears on Class/Interface 
wizard dialog before Class search dialog appears. Even with caching it takes 
about 2..3 seconds to show dialog on PIII-800 512mb ram.
What dialog are you talking about? Open Type or Search dialog (Ctrl+H)?

It is about Open Type dialog, which can be called by Ctrl+Shift+T shortcut or 
from some wizard dialogs for selecting a class.
Adapted summary.
Please note the same problem with "Open Resource" dialog
It looks like it still runs modal search progress bar on a first start.
No, it doesn't. The problem is that a user might request a Open Type while the 
search isn't finished yet. In this case we have to wait until they background 
thread has finished.
