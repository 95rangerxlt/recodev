Steps:

1)select some packages and export jar
2)select 'Export java source files and resources'
3)Next
4)select in 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' a .jardesc that already 
exists.
5)Next
6)Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that 
already exist (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second 
time with the presevered settings).
7)Finish

8)A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file. 
Choose NO.
9)A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file. 
Choose NO.

Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed, because saving 
manifest to workspace failed and saving description to workspace failed. If you 
click okay you will return to the wizard.

10)Choose Cancel.

Go to were your .jar file was to have been generated and note that it was 
indeed created. This is because the jar file is created before the overwrite 
verifications happen.

Other notes: 
-the messages 'saving manifest file failed' is perhaps incorrect in this case 
as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a 
failure). Same goes for '.jardesc' file.

-prehaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well) 
would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file then a dialog box at the 
end. Either way not overwriting this file should not cause the wizard to not 
complete its operation. 

-The 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new 
manifest file. If the user wants that they should use the 'save the manifest in 
the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the 
workspace' option.

Already fixed:
-The 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new 
manifest file. If the user wants that they should use the 'save the manifest in 
the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the 
workspace' option.

Fixed other comments: no error or warning at the end if user decides not to
overwrite.
