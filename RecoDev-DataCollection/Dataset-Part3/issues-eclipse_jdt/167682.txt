The 'Referenced Libraries' node stays in the Package Explorer when all libraries are filtered (enable filters 'Libraries from external' and 'Libraries from project').

This is inconsistent with the 'Plug-in Dependencies' node which is removed as soon as the 'Libraries from external' filter is active.

We can filter the node only if all it's children got filtered. Children could be class folder, internal JAR's and external JAR's and different filters work on those. The viewer filter doesn't have access to all the filters of a view...

So I guess strictly speaking its wrong to filter container: they can also contain project references...

Fixed in the package explorer viewer implemenatation by testing if the library container has non-filtered children. The correct implementation would be to do that in the filter: Filters should have the information if they have non-filtered children.
For this reason, this isn't working in the project explorer. Request to Michael is pending for a similar bug 166872.
