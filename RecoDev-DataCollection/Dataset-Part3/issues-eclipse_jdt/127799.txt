On the last page of the JAR file export wizard, there's a Browse button under 'Use existing manifest from workspace'. It opens a dialog that is only partly sorted (looks like all source projects first and binaries later). If this is really the intention, then there should be a binary decorator for binary projects, and/or a dividing line between the groups.

If this was not planned, then a viewer sorter should be installed.
