build i0718

- in the Java Perspective
- select "Link with Editor" in the Package Explorer
- open an editor on a file
- in the Package Explorer hit the "minimize tree" icon
- select the editor

Note that the package explorer doesn't show the selection.

In order to "re-enable" the function for that editor, you either have to click on the icon (twice) or switch to another editor and back.

Is this still a problem in 3.3?

yes
Is this because the fLinkWithEditorListener in PackageExplorerPart doesn't track partActivated(*)?

If not feel free to bounce it back,
