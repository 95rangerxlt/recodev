2.0 Release

If you use JavaUI.createTypeDialog() to create a new (single selection) type 
dialog, and then open the dialog, the open will fail silently.

The dialog cannot be succesfully opened unless you send setMessage() to the 
dialog before you open it.

This behaviour should be documented, or, preferably, a default message 
("Please select a type/class/interface") should be provided.

We should provide a default message in this case.
