Given:
package test;
public class E1 {
	public String s1= "Value";
	public String s2= "Value";
}
1. Eclipse style externalize E1, accept all defaults
2. Source>Externalize...
3. Change key 'E1_1' to 'E1_0'
Is:
 Field 'E1_0' is removed in 'Messages' resulting in compile error
Should:
 Field 'E1_1' should be removed

Not a regression: This is also in 3.3.2. In 3.1.2 the field is not deleted but renamed, resulting in a compile error due to duplicated fields.
