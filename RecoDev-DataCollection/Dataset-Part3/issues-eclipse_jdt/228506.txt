Screenshot showing the error dialog

build ID: I20080422-0800

When quitting Eclipse with several editors open, I saw attached error dialog. I re-started Eclipse and found the .log file (to be attached). Several editors were open. When choosing "Close all Editors", I got the same error dialog shown again twice, which likely corresponds to the problems reported for swtBuilderCompletionProposalComputer and TemplateProposalComputer.

Doesn't make much sense to create the computer when closing the editor, does it? ;-)
