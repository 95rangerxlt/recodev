Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I found not a single test for the serial version quick fix that actually tests the functionality.

CleanUpTest tests ADD_CALCULATED_SERIAL_VERSION_ID, but the tests all compare with 1L. This succeeds with an 1.4.2 VM (because the quick fix seems to be broken there), but fails with 1.5.0 (a nontrivial serialVersionUID is generated).

SerialVersionQuickFixTest does not compare the generated id and thus succeeds even if the quick fix failed and fell back to 1L.
