Still an issue in 20020115
Pls try out the improved editor/view/action enablement support that was added. 
we should also check whether the OpenOnSelection and OpenHierarchy should be 
RetargetableActions as is now supported by new View/Editor/Action enablement.
Build 20020425. The two actions are now usable whenever they are visible. 
According to the platform guidelines they are visible when the editor or the 
outliner have the focus.
