Given:
package pack;
public class E {
	public int test;
}

package pack;
public class Test {
	public void foo() {
		E name = new E();
		name.test = 5;
	}
}

1. Select E
2. Extract Class...
3. Generate Getter/Setter
4. OK
Is:
 Dialog showing 'E' says 'unable to convert node to getter/setter'
Should:
 Dialog showing 'Test' says 'unable to convert 'name.test' to getter/setter'

Is this possible?
In this case it should be able to transform the node ;) But I could correct the E vs. Test thing. But the 'name.test' would require rendering the ast to text. Albeit this is possible it could blow the message. Fortunately the dialog shows the affected node below as selection.
Yes, this works now. Replace it with

if (name.test++>0)
  foo();

Selecting the node is ok.
