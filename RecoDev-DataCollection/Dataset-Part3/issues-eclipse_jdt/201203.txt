Created attachment 76992
proposed patch

Build ID: I20070625-1500

If an import has a warning (e.g., regarding access restrictions),
no quickfix (@SuppressWarnings) is offered, because imports
do not reside within an annotatable element.
However, adding a @SuppressWarnings annotation to the
first toplevel type actually silences the warning.
I think this change should be proposed as a quickfix.

I attach a proposed patch.

(I assume it to be safer to handle this case locally in 
SuppressWarningsSubProcessor rather than patching 
ASTResolving.findParentBodyDeclaration, which is used 
by others, too)
