	I have a wizard that sets the default classpath from the outside on the NewJavaProjectWizardPage
	(build path page).
	when I push the back button from the build path page and then set a different default classpath
	when entering the build paths page, the classpath on the build paths page is still the same as
	before.

MA (31.07.2001 17:27:08)
	fixed in 200
	When the build path page becomes visible, the defaults are forced to be used if they have been changed since
	the last getting visible.
