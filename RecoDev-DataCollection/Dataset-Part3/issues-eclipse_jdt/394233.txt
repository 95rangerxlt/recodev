Version: 4.3.0
Build id: I20121106-0800

If you add a standard VM on the Mac and then try to use that to launch a plugin JUnit test - in my case I was trying to launch the Ant UI tests - you get an InvalidThreadAccess exception and the launch dies.

The reason is because the -XstartOnFirstThread VM arg is missing, and is *not* added by default for non-Mac VMs. The even more confusing part is that the new option to add the VM arg is there and checked on the Arguments tab (added from bug 211625). 

The logic in that fix must be updated to either not show the option for non-Mac VMs or I need to push the support up from the Mac-specific VM runners to the platform VM runners.

Pushed first cut to: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?id=78d1aa87b7fca18a351b798adba6e5ec4aa347c6

I see no reason why we should not put the support for detecting the need for - and adding - -XstartOnFirstThread in the StandardVMRunner. The Mac-specific VM will eventually not be available at all and all launching will be done with a standard VM on Mac.

This will also make the launch config setting (for adding -XstartOnFirstThread) work uniformly for all consumers that do Java launches - Java, PDE, JUnit, etc
Pushed a small update to make sure -XstarOnFirstThread is used even if the configuration has not been migrated (maintaining existing support for adding it):

All unit tests pass + manual tests.

I added a new section in the test plan for Mac OSX vs. Standard VM testing: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Test_Script#Mac_OSX_Launching

I also added a blurb about how we must run the test suites using a Mac OSX VM and a Standard VM
