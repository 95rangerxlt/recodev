Markus, can you have a look at this. Should be quite simple (according to Tod).
From Tods mail:
To be done:
- Hierarchy for the JDT problems for the hierarchal mode (this is super easy)
- Subcategories for JDT problems
- Better path for JDT problems (i.e. package name rather than file system path)

Released first item to HEAD. The other ones need more investigations.
This is done.
