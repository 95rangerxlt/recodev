Using 3.0 M9 build

Create a simple class like

import java.util.Map;

public class Text {
   Map myVar;
}

Do the following in the exact order
1) Add an "s" to Map (e.g. Maps myVar;)
You will get the error annotation

2) Remove the ";" after myVar (e.g. Maps myVar)
You still have the error annotation (tooltip will indicate 2 errors on that 
line)

3) Remove the "s" to Map (e.g. Map myVar)
Notice the error annotation goes away. But the line is still missing the ";" 
If you hover where the error annotation should be, the tooltip comes up 
indicating a ";" is missing

We show transient problems only in the vertical ruler in the case they are 
quick fixable. For the missing semicolon this is not the case. You still see 
the squiggles. We should not show the hover when there is no icon.
