In order to minimize incremental builder actions, the classfile comparator should be able to ignore synthetics.
Note that this should be optional and not cost on cases where nothing has changed.
The intent is that this mechanism can be turned on/off so as for the builder to experiment.

NOTES:

	A different number of fields or methods means that something changed. So if a synthetic field disappeared, I think we can conclude that a change occured and recompile the
	class.
