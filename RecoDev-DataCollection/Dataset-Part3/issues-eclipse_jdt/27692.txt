Hi, 

The underscoring of references on search are hardly visible. Only red color 
shows clearly and this is used for compilation errors.

Instead of underscores, please use background color and highlight the items 
that are currently being underscored as a result of search.

This is a good feature but underscores are not a good idea from usability point 
of view for Search results.

moving to text - the editor decides how to render markers
The color of the squigglies for markers can be chosen per marker type. See the 
Java editor preference page. There will be background highlighting in future 
versions. Probably post 2.1.
As posted above, only red color shows clearly. That implies I have tried the 
other colors.

Most colors are very light. Even black is not very visible. Red is visible but 
conflicts with compilation errors.




Get rid of deprecated state.
Fixed a long time ago. Search matches are now highlighted in the editor and the color is configurable on the Annotations preference page.
