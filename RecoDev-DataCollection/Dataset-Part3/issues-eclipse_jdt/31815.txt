build I20030211

Before a method with no comment, type /** <enter>.
You get:
	/**
	 * 
	 *
	 */

This has one more blank Javadoc line than I expect.

cannot reproduce on I20040914-gtk. Closing, please reopen if you still see this.

( I believe the problem had to do with a wrong default template for method
comments - but it's been a while...)
I couldn't reproduce it in 3.0.1 either.

bug is still here in I200409212000:

Test Case:
1. create class Test
2. add void test(){}
3. place caret in line above method
4. type "/**" + Enter
==>
	/**
	 * 
	 *
	 */


Maybe a regression form fixing other /** + Enter related bugs for M2?
