The formatter(?) doesn't un-indent sufficiently after a multi-line comment.

(Not sure if this is the formatter.  I'm refering to the component which 
indents code automatically as you type.)

If you enter a multi-line comment like:

/*
 * this is a comment
 */

The cursor will be indented one space too far when you finish the comment.  
That is, the next line that you type will line up with the last '*', instead of 
the opening '/'.

Deferring. Formatter issues are not on the 2.0 plan.
Resurrecting formatter issues in 2.1 stream.
Clearing resolution
We need to clear 2.1 bug reports that won't be addressed before 2.1. The new 
implementation is still in the works. Therefore we cannot include it for 2.1. 
Not enough testing and we need to polish the preferences. This will be address 
for 2.2 as stated in the JDT/Core plan.
Resurrecting for 3.0
Move to JDT/UI. They position the cursor at the right indentation.
has been fixed a while ago
