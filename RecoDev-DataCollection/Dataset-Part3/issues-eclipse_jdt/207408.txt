Thanks, Markus!

I didn't realize the APT problems showed up in that dialog.  Looking at it, I think we should also be organizing them all into a single category, rather than as separate items.

Do you know how JDT does this?  For instance, there is a "Java Build Path Problems" category, that expands to contain "Build Path Problem" and "JRE System Library Problem".  I can't figure out where that text is coming from or how the categories are declared.
Fixed the untranslated string in both HEAD and 3.3.2.  (The reason I fixed it in 3.3.2 is because that's where the string was introduced.)

I will open a separate bug for categorizing the problems together.
