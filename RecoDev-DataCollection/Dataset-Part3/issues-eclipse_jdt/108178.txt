I expect to see "Test error" or something like that in the Problems view after
executing the following, but I don't:

        ICompilationUnit cu = _myCompilationUnit;
        AnnotationProcessorEnvironment env =
EnvironmentFactory.getEnvironment(cu, cu.getJavaProject());
	env.getMessager().printError("Test error");

The call to printError() has no effect that I can see.

This should actually die with an UnsupportedOperationException. You're not
allowed to add errors outside of annotation processing in either a reconcile or
a build.

The EnvironmentFactory is there to support browsing types. It should be doc'ed
to indicate its limitations.
EnvironmentFactory is now doc'ed to cover its limitations, and getFiler() and
getMessager() now throw UnsupportedOperationExceptions.
