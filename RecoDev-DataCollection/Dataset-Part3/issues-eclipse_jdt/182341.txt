As a 3.3 polish we can add a checkbox to the formatter preview on the formatter preferences modify dialog to enable/disable invisible characters:

Preview:          
|dasdfd                        |
|afadfdsfafdadf                |
|  dsafasddffdsafas            |
   [x] Show invisible characters

Unchecked by default.
This would especially help to understand the tab policy.

I'm showing invisible characters on the clean up modify dialog (bug 173079). It's basically the same code.
