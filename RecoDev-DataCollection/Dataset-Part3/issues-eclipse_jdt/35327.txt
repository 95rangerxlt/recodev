In the Java Build Path/Libraries properties page, there is a button 
called 'Add Library'. When i click this, I get a list of libaries, which is a 
set of jars, that I can add. I have not been able to find a way to define my 
own set of jars (i.e. a library) and have it appear in this list. I would like 
this feature to be added.

Note that this is different from the 'Adding a library folder to the build 
path' functionality that is described in Help.

User definable JRE containers are not supported for 2.1. The only way to add 
them right now is via code.

No further action planned for 2.1, but we should reconsider for > 2.1
Reopeing 
User defined libraries got added for 3.0
