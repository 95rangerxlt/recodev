1) create a project with a src folder 'src'
2) create a class and drag'n drop a file 'readme.txt' in the default package.
3) preference page :: java :: builder :: specify filtered 'resources'
   = '*.txt'
4) observe that the file 'readme.txt' is still copied to 'bin'.

Changing '*.txt' to 'readme.txt' did not help.
