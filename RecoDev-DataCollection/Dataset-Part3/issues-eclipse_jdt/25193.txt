Build 20021016

I have this hierarchy:

class Resource
class Container extends Resource
class Folder extends Container

I would like to pull up several methods from Folder to Resource.  The "Pull Up"
refactoring only allows me to pull up to immediate superclass, so in this case I
have to pull up twice. It would be nice if the "pull up" refactoring allowed me
to chose the destination superclass.
