I'm in the resource perspective, my workspace has the following simple projects and files:

/Project1
   test1.txt
/Project2
   test2.txt

And here are the steps I took:

1) Selected test1.txt, drag it to some white space in the project explorer and then back onto itself and release the mouse button (nothing happens which is as expected).
2) Did the same thing with test2.txt, but when I released the mouse button, test1.txt is moved into /Project2

Michael, this is specific to the Project Explorer, the Package Explorer does nothing.

I was able to make this happen on Windows for 3.4, but not on Linux.
This problem happens when the JavaDropAdapterAssistant handles the drop.

I have not fully debugged it, but it's very easy to make this happen on Windows.  Set a breakpoint at JavaDropAdapterAssistant.handleDrop.  In handleDropMove, it relies on the value of fElements which is stale (it refers to the other project).

Suggested patch

I don't fully understand the purpose of all of the fields, so this patch might be defeating some optimization or something, but this seems to fix the problem.

This has been fixed some time ago.
