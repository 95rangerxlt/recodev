When I select some javadoc text and invoke the 'Surround With' menu I get no ptions other than 'Try/catch block'.  The next part of the popup menu contains the text: 'none applicable'.   I've checked the registered templates and there are several listed for the javadoc context.  

The surround with functionality works fine when used on java code.

The problem also appears in 3.2.0

It works if you select the lines and use content assist (Ctrl+Space) but not when using via 'surround with'.
Benno, what's the idea here? We probably should show the proposals.
At the moment only templates with a java context type are considered, this is hard coded. Better would be to use the partitioner and show only the templates with a compatible context type. At the moment you can select multiple Javadoc lines and then surround this with a for loop, which is pretty useless. 
Hint that there are no default javadoc templates containing a line_selection variable.
This fails for me too, context assist works, but surround with... doesn't

eclipse 3.2.0, the template is just "new BigDecimal(${word_selection})"
