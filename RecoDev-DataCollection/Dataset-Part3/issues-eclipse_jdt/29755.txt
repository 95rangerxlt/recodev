When opening some .class that does not yet have a source attachment eclipse 
shows a text version of the interface defintion and a button for Attaching 
source. 




When pressing this button a window appaer where one can enter the name/location 
of a folder, zip or jar for the source. There are also a button for choosing it 
via a file selection dialog and this works fine for zip and jar files - but not 
for selecting a directory :(




Workaround is just to enter the directory manually.
