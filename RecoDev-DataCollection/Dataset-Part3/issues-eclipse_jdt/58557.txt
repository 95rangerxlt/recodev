I'm sure this is a dupe but I thought I'd collect all I could find on the issue
in one place so someone "in the know" could clean it up. A new bug was just a
nice way of not screwing up anything that was already there. 

Bug 30315 (LATER, maybe should be reopened?)
Bug 32447 (LATER, refers to the global issue of per-project settings)
Bug 45240 (NEW, maybe should be dupe? also, it's dupes seem to be refering to a
different issue)
Bug 49461 (FIXED, looks like an old bug in the underlying code that might point
whoever looks at this in the right direction)

Most of these also have dupes that it could be profitable to read through the
comments on. From what I can tell from these comments everything is done except
the UI.

Martin, I guess (some of) these bugs should be closed now.
I also saw Bug 67662 for this, but I didn't find a bug which is set to FIXED.
