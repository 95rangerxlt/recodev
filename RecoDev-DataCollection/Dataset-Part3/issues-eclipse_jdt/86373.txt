Hi,

i found following problem with WorkingSets from the Eclipse
Version 3.1M5a:

1. Open Java Perspective
2. Select Package Explorer View
3. Create new Java WorkingSet and assign Java files from two projects to this
WorkingSet.
4. Close one of the projects.
5. The WorkingSet stay selected.
6. Close Eclipse.
7. Start Eclipse.
8. Now all files from the closed project will be removed from the created
WorkingSet.

Under 3.1M3 works fine. The files from the closed project stay in the WorkingSet.

Sounds like a problem with the Java working set's updater.

The problem here is that unexisting elements are removed from a working set.
However if possible we can try to find out if the project still exists and if
yes we simple leave the element in when working set is restored. However, then
the package explorer content provider has to check if the element exists and if
not filter it out. If we do this the working set model must be refreshed on
every open/close of a project.
Fixed for M6 as proposed.
