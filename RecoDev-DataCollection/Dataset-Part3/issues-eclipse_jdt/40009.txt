define a template as follows
-----------------------------
method(${parameter},${paramter2});
-----------------------------

when using the above template if you put string as the first parameter and the 
auto-closing of quotes is enabled eg.
----------------------------
method("hello",parameter2);
----------------------------
when you press tab the second parameter is not highlighted!

The same problem occurs if auto-closing of brackets and parenthesis is activated
and you enter a '(' oder '['. 

It looks like that auto-closing starts a new template (you can see the green
line) which cancels the linked-edit mode of the template executed before.

If there is no way to handle such nested templates properly, is it at least
possible to disable auto-closing inside template execution automatically? 
Otherwise it seems to be the only way to disable auto-closing permanently if you
want to use templates frequently (or is there anyone who wants to toggle this by
hand before and after every template call?)
Confirmed on I20030923

There problem is caused by the fact that the string/variable is enclosed by
brackets. The string is auto-closed and once it is entered the  link mode is
completely left.

If the variable is not enclosed by brackets it works but the string is not
auto-closed which is a bug as well.


LinkedPositionManagers can coexist in certain situations, e.g. the auto-closer
(brackets, strings...) can coexist with other auto-closer managers. Templates
are a different story - when an autoclose manager comes up, it tears down the
template manager.

That strings and brackets are not closed in certain situations(see comment 2) is
not a bug but the normal autoclosing behaviour (strings get only closed if the
'"' does not neighbor an identifier, brackets only they are the last character
on the line).

We need to investigate better coexistance strategies for linked position managers. 

We also need a story how to jump from one linked level to the next: Currently,
one leaves a level by pressing ESC, which is not too user friendly. On TAB, the
linked positions are cycled - we might choose to advance to the next level
instead of cycling if there are hierarchical linked position managers.
A possible solution seems to be to make auto-closer managers to always coexist.
The context where they get invoked should not interfere with templates (there is
no big insertion, just a peer character that gets inserted).

This does not solve the traversal problem. See also bug 39683 about a plan item
for a traversal strategy for linked positions.
released code so that auto-closers can coexist with templates. Still, code
completion with parameter guessing will not work inside a template, i.e. cancel
template mode. This will be adressed in a general Linked Mode overhaul.
closing for now, as the original feature request (quote and brackets cancel
template mode) is in.
