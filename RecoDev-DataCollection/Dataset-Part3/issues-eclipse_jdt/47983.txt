I have my code formatting style set so that code appears a bit like

some code
{
    some more code
    if (condition)
    {
        second indent
    }
}

When typing under normal conditions, pressing a return
after 'if (condition)' the cursor is initally pressed
indented and is put to the correct place (under the if)
after you type a '{'.
Thats fine.
However taking a bit of code that is unformatted or wrongly
formatted, eg pasted from elsewhere. One way of formatting
is to delete all the white space and then press tab.
This correctly indents most lines except those starting with
a '{' which are indented by one indent too many.

To test
Go to windows | preferences | java | code formatter
tick 'insert a new line before opening brace'
Type in 

int a = 0,b = 0;
if (a == b)
{
    if (a == b)
    {
        if (a == b)
        {
        }
    }
}

Now choose any of the opening {. Posistion cursor just before.
hold shift press home. press delete.press tab.

I know this is only a bug for those of us that do not use Sun's
coding standards but as its an option in the code formatting 
section it would be nice for this to work properly.

If you have more questions, ask.

Rob, what version are you working with? This has been fixed a while ago and
works fine for me with various formatter settings, including "new line before
brace".

I will close the bug for now, please reopen it if you still see this in the
newest integration build.
