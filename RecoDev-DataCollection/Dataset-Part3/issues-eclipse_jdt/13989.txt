5. Switch to this new default JRE 

Note that the package view did not update.
The reason for this is that the Java delta did not get notified due to a bug in 
the delta batching on JavaModel operations.

Note that if there had been some parallel resource changes (or marker changes) 
then the delta would have got fired and thus the package view refreshed. This 
can occur if auto-build is on (Java Builder triggers some resource changes if 
classpath changes) or there are some project with classpath problems (missing 
entries, cycles, ... will induce some marker refreshes).

Right now, the package view will only be refreshed at the next resource 
modification (deferred).
Fixed by changing the JavaModel operation batching strategy (ignore situation 
where there are some awaiting deltas, as soon as an operation doesn't modify 
resources, queued deltas are fired).
