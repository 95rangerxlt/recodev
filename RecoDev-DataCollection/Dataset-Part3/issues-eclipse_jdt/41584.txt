This happens in 3.0M2

If I'm searching for references of a method, I usually right click,
Search->References->Workspace.
However, with large workspaces, this can take pretty long, so I've gotten in the
habit of searching for references within a working set.  I usually define a
workingset for each project and all its contents.

The problem is, when I search for references of a method in the workingset, it
does not find references to that symbol from the thirdparty jars I have attached
to the project's build path (verified the jar is selected as part of the working
set).  However, if I search the workspace, it does find the references in that
thirdparty jar.  This is usually for a method defined in the thirdparty jar that
I use, and want to see how it is used by the thirdparty.

Daniel, please have a look. 
Are the JARs inside the workspace or external?
