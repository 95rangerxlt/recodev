Build ID:  M20070212-1330

Steps To Reproduce:
The export to archive option does not export directories which are empty.

This causes issues in cases where the directory is part of the src path. Importing such a projects results in errors in the problems view.

Project web is missing required source folder: 'src'		
project cannot be built until build path errors are resolved		


At this point if the user 
switches to the project explorer view, right click on java resources and selects the option to create a new source folder named src

an error message is displayed the folder is already a source folder when it does not physically exist

The folder is already a source folder.


create a new web project
export the project to an archive
delete the project along with files
import the archived project from the archive
notice the errors in the problems view
switches to the project explorer view
right click on java resources and select the option to create a new source folder called src
this will fail

Indeed, this is confusing... 

Workaround is to do:
1. New>Folder... 
2. Folder name: 'src'
