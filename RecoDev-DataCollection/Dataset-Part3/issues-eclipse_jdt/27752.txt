switch to java perspective

preference pages should not be loaded on switching to java
nor should it activate launching plugin
this is the only pref page loaded, as the initilization code is a little bit 
complex.
The reason why the launching plugin is loadad is that we use 
constants 'JRE_SRC' and the name of the JRE_CONTAINER.

Question to Darin: Do you think it would be ok to use the string directly
(assume that 'JRE_SRC', JRE_LIB' and 'org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER' 
are well know constant values)?
The best would be if the Javadoc comment of the constants says something like
	/**
	 * The plug-in identifier of the Java core support
	 * (value <code>"org.eclipse.jdt.core"</code>).
	 */
) 

Yes, using the actual value would be fine. We will put the value in the 
javadoc, such that it is considered API.
Released the "values" into the javadoc.
Please resolve for M4
dependency to launching plugin removed.

NewJavaProjectPreferencePage still referenced. The initialization code is 
bigger/same than the UI code, it doesnt make sense to move it to 
PreferenceConstants. UI code in NewJavaProjectPreferencePage is small.
