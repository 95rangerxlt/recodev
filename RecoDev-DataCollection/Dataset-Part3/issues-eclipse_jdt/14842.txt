It happens quite often (not all the time) than when hitting ctrl-s in a dirty
editor, its content is saved and the editor scrolls to the top automatically,
causing me to lose the context I was focused on.
When using the right-click menu 'save' option, this problem doesn't occur.
are you working with the new reconcile option?
Have seen this once too. Do you have a reproducible case or some more indepth 
knowledge how it differs when it happens? 
The reproducible case relys on having the java browsing perspective open. This 
is fixed in build > 20020508.
