Define a Java project, then go and discard the rt.jar from its build path.
Now import a bunch of source files in it (like the batch compiler), it will import then start compiling incrementally, and it will take it over 2 minutes to complete, given the
incremental recompilation loop is restarting over and over again.

It should be faster to notice that nothing can be done (a one pass compilation should be all it needs to figure this).

NOTES:

PM (3/28/2001 12:42:18 PM)
	TechPreview had the same incorrect behavior.

DB (23.05.2001 19:10:21)
	I got the same behaviour while catching up from the repository and got a wrong class path. It seems that the builder is in an endless loop.

Closed - not reproducable with new builder.

Fails the entire build when the first class notices it cannot find Object.
