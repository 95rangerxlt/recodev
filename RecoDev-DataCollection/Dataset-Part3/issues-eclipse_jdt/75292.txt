Hi all,

I'am new to eclipse on linux and I've just installed the eclipse-gtk version
3.0.1 on linux red-hat 7.3.

The java file editor seems to me very bad, is there a way to personilize the
distance between two lines that is actually two large for me

For example in eclipse editor I see this text as follow

/*

 * Created on 16 juin 2004

 *

 * TODO To change the template for this generated file go to

 * Window - Preferences - Java - Code Generation - Code and Comments

 */






But I want to se it like this

 */

Can you post a screenshot?
Hi, 

I found my problem, its a configuration problem. 

Solution: 

windows > preferences > workbench > colors & fonts

the policy was set to default text, thats why, 

I changed it to times for example and fixed the fonts. 


Thanks

you can close the case
