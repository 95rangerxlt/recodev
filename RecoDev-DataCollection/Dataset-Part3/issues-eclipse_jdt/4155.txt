(1) Create a directory containing a .jar file and a .zip source archive for the jar
The .zip archive should have a non-null root path to the source.
(2) create a classpath variable which points to this directory
(3) place this .jar file in your classpath using the variable
(4) use the Java Source Attachment wizard to set the source archive

Attempt to use the "root variable path".  The "browse..." button is inactive
unless the text field is non-empty.  If the text field is non-empty, pressing the 
browse... button shows the source archive no matter what is in the field.  If 
you make a selection in the paths shown that are relative to the archive, any
path that is deeper than the first is entered without the intervening path variables.

For example, suppose the archive resolves to c:\blort\blort.zip.  I can type "junk" in the
root variable path field to activate the "browse..." button.  Pressing "browse..." shows the 
structure of "c:\blort\blort.zip".  If I select work/src/main as the source root directory 
in blort.zip for blort.jar and press OK the text field for "root variable path" now reads: junk/main.

This was fixed with the source attachment rework in 2.0.
Found a problem with the enablement of the root-'extension' button.
