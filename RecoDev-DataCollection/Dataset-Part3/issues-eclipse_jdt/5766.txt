When renaming an element then the options
to Update references in Strings/Java Doc/Comments is on by default

it is off by default
however, it is persistent and remembers your last setting
i did that to avoid adding new entries to preference pages.
and with no persistence you'd have to enter these settings everytime, which'd be
too frustrating i thing.

ideas?
or is ok to close?
I suggest to not persist these setting. It is not like a preference the user 
should decide for each refactoring whether they want to do this.
removed the persistent state of the 3 text references update fields
(update references field is still persistent)
