I launched Eclipse 2.1 from a brand new Workspace and from there, 
created a Java project (called "Works") by pointing Eclipse to the root 
of my project.

The process fails after a short while (whether I press Next or Finish 
after the first page of the wizard) with a dialog telling me to look at 
the log.

I included the top of the log below (it's about 8k, I can post it in its 
entirety if there's interest).  The error is

       Java Model Exception: Java Model Status [Works does not exist.]

I get the same problem with Eclipse 3.0 M1:  I can't create a new project.

Could you please attach the whole .log file?

The log file
Moving to UI since problem seems related to ordering of operations when 
rendering the build path during creation.
I get this error with the 3.0 M2 version, but do not get it with 200303272130. 
So, I'm creating projects with the older version.
This looks like a duplicate of bug 40322.
Could you please try integration build 0730?
Ignore my comment, this is not related with bug 40322. Waiting for a solution of
bug 40658.
