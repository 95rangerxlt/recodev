Eclipse's code assist for comment and javadoc doesn't add a line feed character 
to the second line of comment, it adds only carriage return character.
Since other editors do not treat carriage return itself as a line feed, line 
nubmers for the source will appear differently between eclipse and other 
editors.

HOW TO REPRODUCE:
  1. In java file, type /** then press enter.
     eclipse will add the following to the source.
     /**
      * comment
      */
  2. Open this file with a different editor: vi, emacs, etc.
     You will see your comment looking like this instead...
      /**
       * comment  */
  3. line number for your source after this comment will appear differently 
between eclipse editor and any other editor.

Verified in latest integration build (I20021105). I tried the two scenarios
below with and without formatter preference enabled and it worked fine.

In all scenarios my file was correct. Did you try this on a new file (created
via the new class wizard) or eventually on a file which has been edited on
another OS?


- added Javadoc in front of a file
  ==> adds no characters only
/**
 *
 */

- added Javadoc in front of a type
  ==> adds the type comment template
	/**
	 * 
	 * @author dmegert
	 *
	 * To change this generated comment edit the template variable                 
         *  "typecomment":
	 * Window>Preferences>Java>Templates.
	 * To enable and disable the creation of type comments go to
	 * Window>Preferences>Java>Code Generation.

Created attachment 2353
Test.java file that shows the problem.

Please open this file with vi editor, editplus, or with dos's edit command.
You will see that line numbers are incorrect.

I noticed that some of editors handle this same as eclipse (Word, Ultra edit)
but not every editors...
Please read the last comment and view the attachment with vi editor.
Yep. My editor converted the file underneath.
Bug can be reproduced by using a simple hex editor.

Increasing severity since this messes up files.

moving to JDT Text component.
