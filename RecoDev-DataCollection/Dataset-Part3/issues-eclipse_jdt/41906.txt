Type the following code and press return at the indicated cursor position.

  addActionListener(new ActionListener() { <<<cursor_position>>> )

You get the following code:

  addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    )
  }

The normal brace and the curly brace should really be exchanged.

Agree, also doesn't work if auto-close options are enabled and the code is typed in:
first you get
addActionListener(<<<cursor_position>>>)
then
addActionListener(new ActionListener()<<<cursor_position>>>)
then type {
addActionListener(new ActionListener(){<<<cursor_position>>>)
now press Return
==>
  b.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
    )
  }

Note that this is only true if the return was not typed in the normal flow of
typing. If I type the brace followed by <return>, I get the expected result.
