Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a new class, Foo, with empty methods a(), b(), & c(), in that order.
2. In the Outline view, drag b() onto a()
3. the function order is now a(), c(), b()


More information:
It's never been quite clear to me what the dragging rules are - part of this is because we drag ONTO another item rather than BETWEEN two items (or before or after the first or last, respectively).  So I wondered what the rules were.  So I set up this little test, and tried all six cases.  Here's what I found:

(1) a -> b : a, b, c
(2) a -> c : b, c, a
(3) b -> a : a, c, b
(4) b -> c : a, c, b
(5) c -> a : a, b, c
(6) c -> b : a, c, b

Of these, I would only consider 2, 4, and 6 correct.  There's some ambiguity, of course, because of the ONTO/BETWEEN issue, but I can't come up with any rationale that makes 3 correct.  I was mostly curious for the multiple-selection drag case, but I stopped testing when I found out how weird the single-selection case turns out to be.  I think the best solution would be one that incorporated a DRAG BETWEEN interface; then it would be clear what the behavior should be.

In 3.4 M2, drag and drop got rewroked and drop 'in between' is enabled for non-sorted views
Thanks, Martin,

I'm glad to hear it.  I look forward to 3.4.
