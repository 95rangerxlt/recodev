We have recently introduced the notion of trays to jface dialogs. The tray will
be used to display context help and cheat sheets into any dialog, however in
order to get this, those dialogs that used to subclass Dialog directly must now
subclass TrayDialog instead (wizards and other TitleAreaDialogs will get this
for free). The tray is created as needed, so until it is populated, there
should be no noticeable difference in the dialog. See bug 118934.

This does not apply to very simple dialogs such as message dialogs that should
never require any context help.

We mostly need StatusDialog. I filed bug 126573 to ask to let StatusDialog extend TrayDialog.
Curtis, is there a way to test the tray? When can it be seen?
Sorry Curtis, ignore my question, with I20060207 it's easy to see.

Updated to use TrayDialog in JDT/UI and JUnit > 20060208
