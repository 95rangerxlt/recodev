During and after a debug session, the Eclipse GUI seems to be rather screwed up
as far as the access to basic Java editing functions is concerned.

The debugger opens a view on my source code that 
looks like a Java Editor window.  Only it doesn't behave that way at all.

But in that window, I cannot edit (change source).
It will ignore any attempt to do so.

When I close down the debugger and change to the Java perspective,
the behaviour persists.

Also, the "Outline" view should offer an alternative view to what
I see in that Java editor.  It doesn't, the outline remains blank and empty.

Closing that broken Java editor and reopening the same .java - file
heals the problem.

This is 2.1 M4, I'm running Eclipse itself under SUN JDK 1.4.1
and debug my application using SUN JRE 1.3.1, in case that matters.

It sounds like the file the debugger opened is either a class file (with 
attached source), or ".java" file that is not on the build class path. This can 
happen if your source lookup path points to a location where a duplicate source 
file is located (i.e. does your source path include any area in the workpsace 
or local file system where the same ".java" files are located?)
Well, thank you, that actually was it.

So, this isn't a "major" bug, but an "enhancement request".

I'm changing the title from "After debug session, Java editing screwed up",
to "Read-only Java editor should indicate why it is read-only".

One option would be, instead of simply ignoring any requests to change a source
file that is attached to a jar, the Java editor could show an informational
window to the respect "this source file cannot be changed as it is attached
to XYZ.jar".
The title for the editor should include the ".class" suffix rather than 
the ".java" suffix. Moving to JUI for comment.
This has been fixed a while ago: there are different icons in the editor tab.
