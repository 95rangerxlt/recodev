1. open TestFailure in editor
2. in 'failedtest', change fFailedTest to fFailedTest1
3. don't save, search for references of fFailedTest1
4. The dialog says that element could no be found, but string matches were 
found.

It says a lot about build and launch paths (which in fact I don't really 
understand, how could another match be found, if not from the build path?) 
It should also mention that the 'unsaved' case.

Inexact matches have different background color.
