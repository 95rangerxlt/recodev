In the example below, extract the whole body of m() (both sysout statements):

class C {
    void m() {
        System.out.println("start");
        
        //TODO: really need to implement this!
        
        System.out.println("end");
    }
}

Extract Method removes my precious TODO comment:

class C {
    void m() {
        extracted();
    }

    private void extracted() {
        System.out.println("start");
        System.out.println("end");
    }
}

The comments are not removed when they are not surrounded by empty lines.

This needs more support in the AST rewrite which Martin is working on for M6.

The API is there now, but it will not make it into M6. Will be early M7.
