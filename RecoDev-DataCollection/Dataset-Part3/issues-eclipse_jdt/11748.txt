From the workbench change notes:

API changes
IWorkbenchPartSite.getDecoratorManager() 
- As the DecoratorManager has proven to be required for more than just 
IWorkbenchPartSites we have moved getDecoratorManager() to IWorkbench and 
deprecated the getDecoratorManager() in IWorkbenchPartSite. The one in 
IWorkbenchPartSite will be removed after the other Eclipse components have had 
a chance to switch to the new API.
