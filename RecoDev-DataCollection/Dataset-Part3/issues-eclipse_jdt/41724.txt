When turning on "Fill argument names on method completion" and "Guess filled 
argument names", after accepting a method completion proposal a list of 
proposed arguments is presented.

However it is only possible to navigate through that list via keyboard. Single-
 or double-clicking with the mouse on the highlighted proposal does not insert 
the selected argument, but leaves the default one. It should be possible to 
select the argument by mouse too.

Additionally, after having inserted the first argument by hitting <Enter>, no 
proposals are presented for the remaining arguments. A viable solution would 
be to cycle through the argument list, e.g. when hitting <Enter> or selection 
the proposal by mouse, the selected argument should be inserted and a new 
completion list for the next argument should be presented to the user.

I just noticed that cycling through the argument list fails only sporadically. 
At first sight it seems to be related to linked mode.
- mouse support does not work because LinkedPositionUI will exit if the viewer
shell gets deactivated, which happens when the proposal shell gets focus. (see
LinkedPositionUI.shellDeactivated)

- <ENTER> always just inserts a proposal; we never jump to the next proposal
position upon selection. Press <TAB> to get there.

- occasionally, this will fail because the linked mode exits for one reason or
another. Under investigation.
