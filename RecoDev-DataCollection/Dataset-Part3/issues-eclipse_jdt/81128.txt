Steps to reproduce:
- Open "HelpSearchPage.class" from binary project "org.eclipse.help.ide"
-> The accessor class HelpIdeResources uses an unconventional resource bundle 
field.

Search for static fields of type ResourceBundle whose name contains "bundle" 
independent of letter case.

Adapting summary which as such is wrong: it works for the accessor classes
generated with Eclipse's NLS wizard.

The problem is that the static field normally denotes the bundle name and not
the bundle class and hence it's a of type String which is quite common.

I guess we will do a strict search first and if this fails we allow a fuzzy mode
where all names (ignoring case) containing "bundle". In the future not only the
detection but also the NLS Wizard should be configurable regarding the bundle name.

A simple and very cheap test for properties files associated with an accessor 
class would be to search for files in the same package with the same name 
(ignore case) as the accessor class.
This is what the wizard currently proposes as default.
Unfortunately several projects don't use those (they use Policy or some other
name). We already have lots of problems because we only detect the field names
that the tool supports.
Fixed in HEAD: I've rewritten the NLSHintHelper to no longer be based on
hard-coded field names.
