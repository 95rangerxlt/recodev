Considering that it is illegal to import a type from an unnamed namespace (see 
Bug 54404), Eclispe should not allow (through its UI) users to use types 
defined in unnamed namespaces from types in named namespaces.

Basically i guess this involves blocking such "unnamed-namespace" types from 
the Browse dialogs used in Create Class, Create Interface, Refactor wizards 
etc. when being invoked for a type defined in a named namespace.

For steps to see the problem please see Bug 54404 - JDT cannot resolve import 
of types in default package.

The most we can do is to add a message to the new class wizard to discouraged
the use of the default package 
added a warning message to the type wizards.
