Given the following code:

public class Main {

	private static class Cls implements Interface {
	}

	private static interface Interface {
		default void hello() {
			System.out.println("Hello");
		}
	}
}


Do the following:

1. Put the cursor in the body of Cls
2. Type "hello" and invoke content assist
3. Select "Override method in 'Interface'"


Expected: The following is generated:

		@Override
		public void hello() {
		}

Actual: The following is generated:

		@Override
		public default void hello() {
		}

Which leads to the following error (which is confusing, but that's bug 421477):

  Default methods are allowed only in interfaces with source level 1.8 or greater.

This is with I20140318-0830 by the way. There's also a similar problem when extending the interface, see bug 430814.

Fix + Tests

Attached fix and tests for bug 430802 and bug 430814.
Markus, please review.
Released into master after feedback from Manju:

The method that overrides a default method should invoke the super implementation (like we already do it for non-abstract class methods).

The new 'InterfaceType.super.method()' syntax is in JLS8 15.12.1.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=63a13551c8095a5cb65503af9b477d39918881d0
