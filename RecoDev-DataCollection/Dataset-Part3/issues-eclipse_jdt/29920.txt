Ctrl+Shift+P toggle between the matching brackets, if this is what you are 
looking for. Otherwise, what concrete functionality you are envisioning?
Its not working for me, it doesn't do anything, and its not listed in the 
eclipse help "Keyboard shortcuts for the Workbench, Java development tools, and 
the debugger" (this is the URL on my computer )
http://127.0.0.1:4745/help/content/help:/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/
accessibility/keyboardshortcuts.htm
My eclipse was an old version and now it is fixed
