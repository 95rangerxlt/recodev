Agree.

There are more issues (! means cursor, [...] means selection):

What would you expect in those cases?
1. aaa!aaa
   currently it appends the modifier at the end and normal keys at !
2. aaa[aa!aa]aa

I tend to remove the smart appending and simply insert/replace selection
I'd agree for removing the smartness if it wasn't for the following case(s):

given: Ct!rl
(with ! again being the cursur, the user just clicked 'anywhere' in the textfield)
pressed: Shift
result: Ct + Shift + rl
(note the strange behaviour this gives when inserting Alt)

What about:
- replace the selection only if the result is a valid modifier string
- insert at the cursor position only if the result is a valid modifier string
-> if this doesn't hold insert at the next 'good' position

Needs redesign of how string for modifier is inserted. Pattern "+ {0}" is too
simple. Easiest will be to specify the concat string (" + ").
