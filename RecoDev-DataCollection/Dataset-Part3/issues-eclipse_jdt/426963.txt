Consider the code snippet:
import org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull;
public class Square implements Shape {

	public Integer getArea(@NonNull Integer length) {
		return new Integer(length * length);
	}
}

Refactor "Pull Up" the method to "Shape", the resulting file does not contain the import declaration for @NonNull and hence the user ends up with compilation errors.

Patch + Tests

The fix was to pass the old method declaration to the ImportRewriteUtil#addImports() in PullUpRefactoringProcessor as the new method declaration will not contain the type annotation yet at that particular point.
Note: Check bug 396524 before closing this bug.
The issue was not particular to Java 8. Released the fix with:
