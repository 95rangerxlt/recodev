In RC2.

If you add a source folder inside another source folder, the outer folder's
exclusion filters are updated to avoid ambiguity.  Now, remove the inner folder
from the class path, and re-add it.  Every time this is done, the inner folder
is added to the outer folder's exclusion filter, ad infinitum.

David, how did you add the source folder.

Martin, IMO not critical. Speak up if you think different.
In the build path dialog, using the "Add Folder..." button.  I just realized
that the problem is more that the automatic exclusion is not removed when the
source folder is removed: this means that if I accidentally add "org" as a
source folder under "src", and then realize my mistake and remove "org" from the
class path, I am left with no class files, because the exclusion on org remains.
I agree that we should automatically remove the exclusions that we added.

In fact, the best thing would be if jdt.core does an automatic exclusion of
nested source folders.

Exclusion/Inclusion filters are removed in other source folders if a source folder is removed.
