- auto-build off
- new Java project Test
- change output folder to be Test/bin
- new Java class Test/Test.java
- new file Test/Test.txt
- full build of Test
- delete bin folder (in workspace)
- incremental build of Test
- it recreates bin folder, but it's empty

I've also just saw it (in a self hosting situation) where it regenerated the class files, but did not re-copy the resources.
This is what I was trying to reproduce here, but in this case it's not even regenerating the class files.
Not sure what the difference is.

The bin folder is not a managed source folder so why should deleting it cause 
an incremental build.

Any change to one of the source files did rebuild properly.
