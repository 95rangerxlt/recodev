Doesn't happen if you don't link Java Browsing to active editor. Should be 
doced for 2.0
Additional single click must be enabled.

Dani, please investigate
Single click opens and selects the element in the editor. For some reason the
editor does not select all import declarations when the import container is
selected (this can be verified with the Outline view too) but only positions the
cursor without selecting anything.

This  triggers a selection changed event and because the selection in the editor
does not map back to the container but the first import declaration the tree is
expanded again and the first import declaration gets selected.

The source range for the import container seems to be wrong i.e. does not
contain all the imports.

Moving to J Core.

Test Case 1: Select the import container in the Outline view
             ==> all imports should be selected in the editor
Test Case 2: This PR


Fixing this in J Core would not fix this bug since there's no API to get the
Java element(s) for a given SELECTION (e.g. all the selected import declarations
being the import container).

I fixed this PR's bug in the J Browsing code and filed a new PR for the
selection problem:
Bug 22201: Selecting an import container does not select all imports

Available in builds > 20020806

Reopening, since this bug got incorrectly assigned to JDT/Core.
Closing since the PR is fixed (but was in wrong component).
