BETA_JAVA8:

Overload resolution in Java 8 requires the same construct (lambda expression,
method/constructor references) to be analyzed more than once. Any errors
encountered during these steps should not be treated as an error in the
program and should not be exposed to the programmer - they may at best steer
the resolution in a certain direction.

Presently, we have a hackish solution in place that switches the compilation
result object that accumulates the problem markers. We need a cleaner abstraction
and this ER is raised for that purpose.

This also exposed a bug in ReferenceExpression.java where we _were_ exposing
problems found during overload resolution to the programmer.
