The quick assist "Split && condition" is not available in this example:
  if (true && false) {
      //a
  } else {
      //b
  }

When I remove the else branch, it shows up. It should always be available in the
whole condition (also when caret is inside "true", see bug 74522).

How should look code after split?
not for 3.1

> How should look code after split?

It should look like this:
    if (true) {
        if (false) {
            // a
        }
    } else {
        // b
    }

The elseStatement should just remain where it was before, and the "&& false"
part together with the original thenStatement should form the inner IfStatement.

Could this be considered for 3.2?
I still often want to apply this quick fix, only to realize that it does not work as soon as an else branch is present. Could you fix this for 3.3?
Shame on me, what I proposed in comment 3 is not semantics preserving!

A better example:
    void split(boolean a, boolean b) {
        if (a && b) {
            System.out.println("a and b");
        } else {
            System.out.println("else");
        }
    }

Expected result:
        if (a) {
            if (b) {
                System.out.println("a and b");
            } else {
                System.out.println("else");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("else");
        }

The else statement needs to be duplicated. See also similar bug 156515 for ||.
Reopen.
Fixed in I20081202-0800.
