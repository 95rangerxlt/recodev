External JARs are currently presented in Package Explorer using their full 
path. This causes a problem in cases where this path is long (e.g. self-
hosting). With the standard view widths, the most important part of the path 
(library name) is clipped and users have to scroll or move the mouse over to 
see the tool tip.

It would be much better if the name is split into two parts:

<library name> - <library location>

For example:

Instead of 

d:\eclipse1204\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources_2.1.0\resources.jar

use 

resources.jar - d:\eclipse1204\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources_2.1.0

This way, label will still be clipped, but the library name will be readily 
visible.

This should be a trivial change since it only affects label provider.
