Hi,

I have been working with Microsoft's Visual Studio.NET for a while, and last 
week I also begun wokring with eclipse.  I am pretty sure that you guys have 
made you comparison between the two products.  In any case, I just want to 
point out the following:
It really ticked me off that the auto-complete drop-down list for methods and 
classes doesn't come automatically, and that I hava to press ctrl-space to get 
it.  After using .NET for a while, I already got used to having the list coming 
automatically.  Also, the eclipse help is not so useful (in my opinion) and it 
took me a lot of time to find out the short-cut key ctrl-space.

I am not saying that you should copy stuff from Microsoft, but I definitely 
think that in this case the ctrl-space key is absolutely not necessary.

Oh, and one more thing: In my opinion you should add the entire jdk API 
documentation to the eclipse help.  What you have right now in Eclipse 
(searching for class names, reference, etc) is not enough. It only contains the 
methods signature, but not the API for the methods.  Also, make it searchable.  
The documentation on the web (from sun) are not searchable, and it would be 
nice if it was.

Thanks,

Jonathan Amir
