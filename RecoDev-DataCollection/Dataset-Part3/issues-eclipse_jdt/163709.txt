Create a new class and start typing code which requires an import like :

JButton b = new JButton();

Pressing control-o will do the import.
However, redo the exercise and type other code after that one like :

JButton b = new JButton();
JList c = new JL

JButton will be recognized as a to-be-imported type, yet the incomplete line blocks the import !
A weird and annoying issue.

Moving to JDT/UI
Good point. We are much better now with recovering from syntax errors, so we can allow them on organize import without risking too much (before you would loose all your imports).

Removed the check for syntax errors to see if this is acceptable.

I would like to be able to type :
JButton b = 
and do control-o (organize imports) to have JButton added to the imports
