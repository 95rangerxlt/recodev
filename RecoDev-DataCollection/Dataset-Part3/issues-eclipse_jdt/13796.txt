Build 20020412

I have locally modified one source file, and not saved my changes. Then I 
decided to load back the repository version (replace with latest from repo), 
whithout closing my editor with unsaved changes.

At this point, I got prompted whether I wanted to reload content from file 
system, since it had changed in the meantime. Answering yes has no effect.

The editor remains with unsaved changes. Even closing the editor, telling it 
not to save changes does not resolve this issue. If reopening the editor, it 
still has the stale unsaved contents.

Could not reproduce on F2.
