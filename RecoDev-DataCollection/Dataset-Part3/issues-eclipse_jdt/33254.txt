In the Tasks each Error is automatically detected and entered in the proper way. 
If I fix the Error, the previous marked Error remains still marked - in the 
Tasks AND in the Code-Window.




e.g. Calling the Constructor f() where only f(int) is defined => Highligted and 
marked. Changing to f(4) fixes the problem, but marks are Tasks remain.

Could you please list the steps you perform to reproduce the problem?
What do you mean by "task remains"?

Please keep in mind that squigglies and overview ruler (ruler right of editor) 
indicate temporary problems, i.e., problems that you would see if you would 
save and build. The problems and warnings you see in the Tasks list  and the 
vertical ruler (ruler left of editor) are indicating the current build state. 
I.e., you have to build your project/workspace to get rid of them.
E.g.




public class Leaf {


  int i ;


	Leaf(int value) {


		i= value;


	}




  Leaf increment() {


    ++i;


    return this;


  }


  void print() {


    System.out.println("i = " + i);


  }


  public static void main(String[] args) {


    Leaf x = new Leaf(5);


    x.increment().print();


  }


} ///:~




Build works fine. Now if I change    




Leaf x = new Leaf(5); 




to




Leaf x = new Leaf();




then on the left side it is highlighted. NOTE: I have NOT made a build yet. If I 
correct this error back, then the highlight is turned off. 




If I have made the build with the wrong code, then as you mentioned it is 
highligthed. And correct the error back to the previous state it's still 
highlighted.




For me as a user resp. Java-Developer don't get the difference why the error is 
marked depended on the build state. Especially when in the NON-Build resp. 
Correct-Build the Error could be easily switched ON/OFF while in a wrongly 
Build-Version the Error could NOT switched OFF!

What build are you using? This problem has been fixed for RC1.
In the task list it's still marked with an sign, but you're right, in the 
Code-Window it's proper shown. Don't know if there is an intention for the 
task-list to change also the icon there; if not => close the Bug.




I thought I'm using RC1 but unfortunatly ziped it to the wrong dir => used all 
the time the wrong one :(
