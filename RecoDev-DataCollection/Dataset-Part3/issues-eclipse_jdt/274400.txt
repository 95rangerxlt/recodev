Because of bug 274181, the published jar files were missing entries for directories during this week's milestone builds.  

As a result, teams will need to tag projects that have changed since
I20090429-0930.  Otherwise, the builds will contain the old jars with missing
directory entries.  Features and test bundles do NOT need to be changed. 

Here are the bundles for jdt ui

org.eclipse.search
org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring
org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring
org.eclipse.jdt
org.eclipse.jdt.core.manipulation
org.eclipse.jdt.ui
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.examples.projects
org.eclipse.jdt.junit
org.eclipse.jdt.junit.runtime
org.eclipse.jdt.junit4.runtime
org.junit4
