StructureSelectionActions currently show a dialog "The resource is not on the
build path of a Java project.". We could do better and try to create an AST in
some cases:
- file not on build path
- editor opened from CVS Repository (bug 65246)

Furthermore, (cu.isStructureKnown() == false) should not imply that we can't do
anything. Should try to build an AST and do the job anyway as good as we can.

Markus, something for post 3.0.
Removed restriction that cu.isStructureKnown() must be true.
Removed first restriction too.
