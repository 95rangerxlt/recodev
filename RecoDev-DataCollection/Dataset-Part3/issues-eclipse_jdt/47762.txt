M5
- start Eclipse with a populated workspace
- do nothing for 10 seconds
- open AllTypesDialog
Observe: Sometimes you get a ProgressDialog before the Open Types dialog opens.
This should never happend if Eclipse had been idle for at least 5 seconds because then the 
background caching thread should have started.

The problem is that early ElementChangedEvents prevent the AllTypesCache from running in 
background. An "early" event is an event that comes before the AllTypesCache has been initialized. 
This condition seems to occur more frequently in recent builds.

The fix is to allow for early ElementChangedEvents.
Fix released for N20031130.
