- Import JUnit 3.8.1 source
- In VectorTest, extract a class 'Vectors' that contains the two fiels 'fFull' and  'fEmpty'

The solution is to remove line fBaseCURewrite.getImportRewrite().removeImport(parent.getType().resolveBinding().getQualifiedName()); from ExtractClassRefactoring. Will create a patch once bug 197923 is commited.
One might think about joining ImportRewrite and ImportRemove as both target the same goal and ImportRewrite sometimes fails.
