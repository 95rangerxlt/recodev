When starting a fresh workbench, open the compiler preference page.
The compliance settings (compliance, classfile comp. source comp, enum and
assert) are all initialized with the default provided by JDT core.
Unfortunatly the 'default' check box is not checked as the
last enum is set to warning.

Can you set 'enum' to ignore as default?

Can you set 'enum' to ignore as default?
Can you please elaborate why you need this change ? enum keywords should be
discouraged in general.
The compiler page should come up with the 'default' checkbox checked. 
otherwise I don't see why we call it 'default'.

the 1.4 default settings are currently: classfile 1.2, source 1.3, assert= 
warn, enum= ignore

Should we change this to enum = warning?

I would say that enum as an identifier should be a warning. It should be
discourage (and we have a good examples in Eclipse) to use enum as an
identifier. It makes the code impossible to be built using javac 1.5 in a ant
task for example.
Some users complain that they cannot build Eclipse from soure using default
settings of the javac ant task. The reason is the usage of enum as an identifier.
Moving to JDT UI to change their default
