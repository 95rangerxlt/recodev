I20030925

Currently there are some filters directly contributed to the Package Explorer's
view menu. It would be good if those would be filters like all others i.e. be in
the filter dialog. This is even more useful now that the LRU filters are shown
in the view menu.

To do this we would have to enhance the current filter story (XML, Schema,
description reader, filter dialog, menu) with the ability to provide an icon for
the filter action.
