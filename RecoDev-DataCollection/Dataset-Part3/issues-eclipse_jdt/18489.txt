Build 20020531

1. Create A.java in package p:
package p;
public class A{
}
2. Create B.java in package q:
package q;
import p.A;
public class B extends A {
}
3. Move B.java to p.
Observe: The resulting content of B.java has an extra blank line:
package p;

public class B extends A {
}

Moving B.java back and forth between p and q keeps adding blank lines.

The issue is how to handle end of line comments after imports. I'd assume they 
are rare and I'd opt for deleting the entire line. The comment belongs to the 
import statement anyways.
ImportStructure problem
i ask it to remove the import and it does not think deleting 
the line is a good idea, for some reason

for reference: move B.java to p (*no reference update*)
and invoke 'organize imports' - you're left with exactly the same empty line
package p;

public class B extends A {
}
