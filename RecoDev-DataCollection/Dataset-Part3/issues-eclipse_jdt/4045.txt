	Note that the current implementation
	- has new functionality
	- can be used as content provider for list viewers
	- is directly used by the CheckBoxGroup (as model)
	- allows to be used with a list (would at least need to protect the public one against CCE)
	- removes the + if a folder/package is empty. the current ViewerFilter architecture does support this
	- some late bugs have only been fixed in the jarpackager version,
		especially the following PRs need to be (re-) verified carefully:
		1GFM3J3: ITPJUI:WINNT - JAR Packager: Reports duplicate entries for default package
		1GHSDS1: ITPJUI:WINNT - Export to Jar does not include root-level resources

	!!! In order to reuse the existing content provider I had to split it
		into two parts. The CVS version of the JavaElementContentProvider before splitting is 1.12.

	Added filters.
