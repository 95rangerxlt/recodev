This is
- faster 
- simpler 
- looks better
- allows left arrow key/right arrow key navigation in drop downs
- allows to go back to filter text with up arrow key
- selects the first item if the selected item has been filtered out
- aligns the filter text field with the table labels
- aligns the table items with the breadcrumb items
