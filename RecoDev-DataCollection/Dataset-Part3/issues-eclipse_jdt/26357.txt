When a table cell (in the editable table of parameters) enters the editing 
state (i.e. when a caret appears in the cell), and then exits the editing 
state, an error message is displayed near the top of the wizard page saying "No 
parameters were modified, reordered or added, the visibility and return type 
are unchanged."

(A user can make a cell enter the editing state by double clicking on it, or 
selecting it immediately after some other cell was selected)
