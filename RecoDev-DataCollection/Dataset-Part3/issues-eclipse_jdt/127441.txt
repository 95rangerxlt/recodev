- run a large (huge) test suite, such as All ZRH tests
- in the junit view, choose to view all tests
- then choose to view only errors

Switching between errors / all may be a frequent thing to do. AFAIR, the previous view did maintain both lists and there was no delay when switching back and forth.

Fixed in HEAD.

[The problem was that I first flattened the tree and only then set the errors-only filter. This caused the tree to realize all TreeItems only to remove them again afterwards.]
