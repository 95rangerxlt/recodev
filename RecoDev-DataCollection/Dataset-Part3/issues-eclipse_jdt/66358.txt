3.0rc1
while editing i ended up with code like:
int f(){
	..do some stuff..
	return foo();
        return bar();
}

now, the second one is not reachable.
quick fixes:
 'remove this return statement'
 'remove other return statements'
would be useful

same applies to stuff like:
int f(){
		
  throw new RuntimeException();
  return 4;
}

enhacement, probably
