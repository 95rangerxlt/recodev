Activating the content assist in the following example shows two entries. Selecting the first "twice" inserts the text. Selecting the second entry "Main.this.twice" does nothing.

Workaround: remember the proposed entry and type it manually.

Version: 3.2.0
Build-ID: M20060629-1905
JDK 1.4.2_12 or JDK 1.5.0_06

=== Code Example ===
public class Main {
  int twice = 0;
  Inner inner = new Inner(){
    void notImportant(){
      int left = tw /* want to select Main.this.twice*/
      //           ^Place cursor here
      // and press Control+blank. Two entries are shown
      // but selecting entry "Main.this.twice"
      // inserts nothing
    }
  };
  abstract class Inner
  {
    int twice =1;
    abstract void notImportant();
  }
}
