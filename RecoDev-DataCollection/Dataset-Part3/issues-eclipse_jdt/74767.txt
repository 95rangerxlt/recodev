anybody remembers what JDK 3.0 or JDK 4.0 looked like?

No such thing. 

The new revision in JDK was originally numbered 1.5. However, Sun and JCP got 
massive feedback that this change was far too fundamental to merit a mere 
minor revision number so JCP and Sun decided to advance the version to 5.0.

i know. my comment was (intended as) a joke.

btw, 1.2 was also named 2 but everyone ignored that and still called it 1.2
i suspect that the same will happen this time.
(but agreed, we should use the official terminology.)
Fixed for M3.
