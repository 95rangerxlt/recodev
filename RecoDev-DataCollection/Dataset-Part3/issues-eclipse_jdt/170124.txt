The org.eclipse.jdt.ui bundle has a dependancy on the org.eclipse.runtime.compatiibility bundle. Is this still required? I don't believe so, so I will attach a patch removing this dependancy.

Created attachment 56729
patch for jdt.ui
The org.eclipse.jdt.junit bundle also has this dependancy.
patch released > 20070112. I also fixed jdt.junit and updated jdt.ui.tests and jdt.ui.tests.refactoring.
