If a class that contains references to nested classes of another class in the 
same package is moved into a different package the automatically inserted 
package statements unnecessarily include the nested classes explicitely.

Instead of:
  import p1.A

The following (illegal) statements are inserted:
  import p1.A;
  import p1.A$B;
  import p1.A$B$C;

The import implementation is too naive. There is no way the source element 
parser can give you resolved information about types.

Its implementation should be revisited alltogether...
Adam, what kind of support would we need from the JavaModel to improve the 
import statement updating.
fixed
the problem is described in bug#3242

jcore answer means it must be done in the our layer
now, we're using JavaModelUtil.getFullyQualifiedName(IType) everywhere
