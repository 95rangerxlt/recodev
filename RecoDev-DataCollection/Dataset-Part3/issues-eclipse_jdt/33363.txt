Using RC1,
1) Create a new class with the following source:
public class B {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("");
	}
}

2) Copy the contents of the main method.
3) Put the curson betweent he two double-quotes and paste the code.
4) The double quotes that you pasted in are not replaced with \".

The Java string wrapping should build a string from the code you paste in. And
in this string " should be converted to \". This is the same problem for all
escape characters.

Patch

This is a patch that is an attempt to fix this problem. It fixes also bug
27004.
Sorry, it fixes also bug 27005.
Do I have a chance to see this bug fixed one day?
It's still not working with 3.0M3 and it is trivial to fix it. Why do we keep a
"feature" that is not working?
I'd like to put in my comment.

I was searching for a bug that addressed cut and paste 
of "C:\windows\file\names\dont\paste\well\to\java"

This causes \n and \t to think it's really supposed to be those escape chars 
and \ to not escape to \\

When this bug is fixed, I recommend it fix these issues as well.
I want to clarify.  I tried to make my comment clear, but now I re-read it yet 
again and see it might not be.

My situation is where I copy the text

C:\windows\file\names\dont\paste\well\to\java

exactly like that from (for example) the Windows Explorer address text field.

Then, I place the cursor in my Java Editor inside a String literal and paste 
the clipboard into the String literal.
This is perfectly clear and IMHO this should work. Handling of escape 
characters is a minimum for a "Smart String Wrapping" including line breaks.
integrated your patch > 20030911
- mostly as is
- only escapes strings if length > 1 (nothing special except for pasting)
- old behaviour on <RETURN>
- added a preference to turn it on/off, on per default.
- works only in "smart mode"
