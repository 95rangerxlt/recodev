Build 20011018.

The new build allows the user to expand classes in the packages view and look 
at their contents. (methods and fields) It would be nice to be able to filter 
out this view so it didn't show you the field if you didn't want it to. (e.g. 
have the same options as you do in the Outline view for a Java file)
