I'm actually using M2, by the way.

I get it when I have the code assist pop up on a '.' then press anywhere to get
rid of the popup and do ctrl-a, ctrl-a, ctrl-k.

It also happens when things get automatically completed (like parens):
suppose I type:
  if(
I get the ending paren auto completed:
  if()
then pressing ctrl-a, ctrl-k won't kill the line. 

This also seems to mess with the font hilighting in various places around the file.

Oh, and when I talk about the hilighting, I mean that after I manage to try the
work around (courtesy of jml@voxa.com) of pressing 'k' then attempting the
delete, the instant I press 'k' the hilighting goes funny.
