Build: I20041216-1600

1) Create two Java working sets and add some projects to them
2) Toggle the Package Explorer to view working sets.  Looks good.
3) Toggle PE back to not showing working sets.
4) From the context menu, pick "Select Working Set"
5) From this dialog, delete one of the working sets defined in 1)
6) Close the dialog and toggle PE back to showing working sets.

-> It is still showing the deleted working set.  Picking "Select Working Set"
still shows the deleted working sets but they contain no projects. If I pick
"Select Working Set" in the Navigator, it does not show the deleted working
sets.  Somehow the PE is remembering about these working sets after the
platform's IWorkingSetManager has removed them.

Fixed for M5.
