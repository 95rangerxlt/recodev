BETA_JAVA8: 

There is no effect seen while formatting this program:

// ---
public class X {
	void foo(@Marker X this) {}
	class Y {
		Y(@Marker X X.this) {}
		void foo(X.Y this) {}
	}
}

@java.lang.annotation.Target(java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@interface Marker {
	
}

This could be due to assumptions that argument name is an TokenNameIdentifier,
which is not true for receiver parameters.

Jesper, thanks for following up.

Test and patch

Great test example, I'd missed a few of those cases :-)

Initial analysis was part of it, but since the receiver is not an argument in the AST, it had to be handled separately.
Patch looks good. Fix and tests released here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=2abb5c60316a8a4cab92c4dd0598d9a27a87d40b

Thanks Jesper.
