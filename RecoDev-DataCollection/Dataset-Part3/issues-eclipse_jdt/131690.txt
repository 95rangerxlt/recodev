With new junit view, it doesn't seem to allow copying a list of failures any longer. Only possibility is to click individual test failure, and copy its trace only. 

This is a regression over old behavior.

+1 for a fix of this regression
the old behavior was not ideal (it did not allow copy of just failure list but always included stacktraces), but better that than nothing
Fixed regression.

Please file an enhancement request if you think copying the test names only would be worthwile (likely not for 3.2).
Is this really fixed? I have:

Version: 3.2.0
Build id: M20060629-1905

...and there is no "copy failure list" anymore on the left side of the junit view.

ok, I think I figured out what is going on... The Copy failures list only appears when one or more failures is generated by the test suite.  When only Errors are present, the option does not appear - a literal application of "Copy FAILURES list" ;-).  

However, when failure(s) and error(s) are both present, the Copy failures list also copy the errors!  I used the following junit example (comment out testFailure assertEquals to reproduce).  

-----
package junit;

import junit.framework.TestCase;

public class FailureVersusError extends TestCase {
	public void testFailure() {
		assertEquals(2, 1);
	}	

	public void testError() {
		throw new RuntimeException();
	}
}
------

Can someone confirm that I'm not the only one with the problem?

So either:

1) have separate "Copy failures list", "Copy errors list", "Copy failures/errors list" and have them to the appropriate thing

2) have "Copy failures list" also appear when there are only errors.
2) was the intention, but this already didn't work in 3.1.

Fixed in HEAD for I20060718-0800. Not changing target milestone since this bug was about the complete absence of the feature -- and that has been fixed for 3.2RC1.
Sorry, in fact this worked fine in 3.1. Comment 4 is a duplicate of bug 150512.
