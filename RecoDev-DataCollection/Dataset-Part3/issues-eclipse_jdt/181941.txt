Select package /org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests/ui/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests.dialogs and search for references in workspace. Search view content description says:
"[..] 3 references in workspace (no JRE) (3 matches filtered from view)".

But when I open the filters dialog, all filters are disabled. Enabling the "Potential matches" filter in the dialog (but not from the menu!) reveals the 3 matches.

the filter that caused the filtering was the 'import' filter and the bug was that it was not shown in the filters list
