Build 20021018

1) Turn on all "smart bracket" options for java editors
2) Start with the following CU:

public class A {
	String foo(String s) {
		return s;
	}
	void bar() {
	}
}

3) Inside the body of method "bar" type the following (type every character,
don't skip over characters that were entered automagically):

foo("hello");
You end up with the following text:

foo("hello");)

That is, it doesn't recognize and skip over the close paren that was entered
automatically.  I suspect this is because it is a case of embedded smart
completions.  It also gets confused if you type "foo(foo(". It auto-closes the
first bracket, but not the nested one.

I believe this is a duplicate of 25156. Still a problem in M4.
"Unassign" PRs because of changes in staffing
Fixed for M5. Does not yet work in segmented view. Marking as depending on 
#31537.
