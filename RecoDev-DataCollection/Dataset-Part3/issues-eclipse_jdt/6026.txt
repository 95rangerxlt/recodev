The plugin import tool should indicate which plugin caused a problem when
problems occur.  This makes it easier for the user to fix the offending plugins
and try again.

For example, let's say you have a plugin.xml file that has library tags that
point to nested folders, i.e.
   <library name="lib">
   <library name="lib/ext">

This causes a problem when you are trying to set the classpath for the plugin,
because you cannot have nested source folders.

The dialog that pops up idicates that a name collision occured.  This is the
jcore message, the plugin import tool should interpret this to say that the
plugin.xml runtime tags are causing nested source folders and give the plugin name.

please verify.

Cool.  However, the error message has an unprintable character in it.  It looks
like the message has a newline in it, but the status dialog doesn't know how to
handle it.

Urf.  Forgot to mention, this works in Integration Build 20011127.
