R3.0

While fixing a bug for 3.0.1 I found out that once platform dictionaries are
provided in org.eclipse.jdt.ui/dictionaries it is no longer possible to go back
to the current behavior where only the user dictionary is taken into account.

This should be fixed by introducing a "none" item into the combo.
