In Eclipse:
- try to search for something Edit -> Search (e.g. resources.invalidProjDesc)
- in the dialog box, clear out the 'Extensions' field (as I want to look at all source files not just
.properties files as the dialog suggests)
- get 0 matches
- repeat the search with .java or .properties as the extension and get matches
- looks like an empty Extensions field means search extension-less files (i.e. <file>.)
- but I want to search <file>.*
- could we have a drop down menu (or something) which gives us an option for all source files?

	no such option is need the user should do a Java search for searching Java sources.
