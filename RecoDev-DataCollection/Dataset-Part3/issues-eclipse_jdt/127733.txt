- Open the JAR exporter on a project
- enter a JAR name
- check the 'export refactoring into JAR file'
- press finish

Note, no refactoring stored in the the refactoring file
I should have gone to the 3rd page to check the refactorings
Is there a reason not to select all refactorings by default?

Just the fact, that exporting the entire refactoring history probably is not what the user intends. I agree that the result is unexspected if the user skips the preview page
We may want to disable the finish button anyway if the wizard is in refactoring-aware mode, since projects have to be selected first to display a preview of the refactoring history
