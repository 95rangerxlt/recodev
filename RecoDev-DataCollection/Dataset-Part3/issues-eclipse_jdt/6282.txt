I have a non-reproducable case that has happened to me four times this evening 
on the 1122 build. I type
/**

and hit return, which creates
/**
 *
and then I type "/" to close the comment, and I get
/**
 *//
(two slashes).

This has happened regardless of whether it was a javadoc comment or a normal 
comment, and I can't make it happen at will but I can reproduce it given enough 
time.

Kai is this the same problem as "double } " that Dirk has reported and that is 
fixed by now?
Fixed in build 20011204.
