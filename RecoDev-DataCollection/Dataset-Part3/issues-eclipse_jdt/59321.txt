Steps to reproduce:
open java editor, insert line:
new String("aa");
move the caret before the letter 'S', press C-del. result:
new aa");

Expected results:
new ("aa");

Comments: Similar effect can be seen with the C-backspace and any example lines
with ""-s. As I remember, this behaviour couldn't be seen in M7 and earlier
milestone versions.

Environment: linux gtk2, Eclipse M8
