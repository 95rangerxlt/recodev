3.0 m9
quite annoing usability problem:

create this:
public int getFoo(){<CARET_HERE>}

press Enter
you get

public int getFoo(){
    }

which is _never_ right. i get annoyed by this every 5 minutes or so.
the same bug in:

if(condition){<CARET_HERE>}

press Enter, you get

if(condition){
      }

which, againi, is never what you want

the behaviour is intentional. the assumption is that you let the closing brace
trail behind the caret until you are finished adding code to the block and then
hit Ctrl+I or so to indent it.

Unindenting would leave you in the wrong location if you want to add some
statements to your block (| is the caret):

if(condition){
|}

...

if (condition) {
return;|}

...

if (condition) {
return;
|}


hmm, pretty nasty. it's never what i want. :)

is there a way to turn this off? that is, other than turning off smart insert 
which i don't want because most of it is real goodness.
(oh, no - i just saw that the raw Insert is gone! is that intentional too?)


After some argueing with Dani, I admit we could probably do better. 

Just indenting the closing brace is wrong because it does not let you keep
typing. We should instead behave the same as when the closing brace is
autoinserted upon pressing ENTER in this situation:

if (condition) {|

-> press return, end up with this:

if (condition) {
    |
}

---------------

So, in this situation: 

if (condition) {|}

we should produce this

if (condition) {
    |
}


-------------

in this situation: 

if (condition) {|return;}

we should produce this

if (condition) {
    |return;
}


------------------

Should we also convert this:

if (condition) {return;|}

into this?

if (condition) {
    return;|
}

oh, and raw insert is not gone - just the default key binding changed to
Ctrl+Shift+Insert. 
very happy! thanks
(the last case i don't have an opinion about.)
3.0 time permitting
Removing target milestone, no further action for 3.0.
+ fixed case 1: 

if (condition) {|}

produces:

if (condition) {
    |
}

- did not fix case 2:

if (condition) {|return;}

will not due any magic to the closing brace. I guess that's closer to the typing
intention.

Marking as fixed as the real case is fixed. The other is won't fix.
