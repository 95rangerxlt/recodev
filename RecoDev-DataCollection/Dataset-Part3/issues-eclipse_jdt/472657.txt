I personally was not aware of that warning / error in JDT and while I was trying to build an AST transformation to fix this in Platform UI I googled a bit and found this blogpost: http://blog.deepakazad.com/2011/07/java-7-support-in-eclipse-jdt-beta-part_22.html

I think we you set it to warning more people will discover it.

This can be considered a style issue.

As for changing the default we would only enable it as 'info', once the corresponding bug 83548 got fixed.

For JDT UI only we can discuss it in one of our meetings.

We can set it to warning for JDT/UI and JDT/Debug projects.

Jay, please consider the same for JDT/Core.

Do you have a nice trick to do this for a set of project? I would like to do this also for platform.ui but I only know how to do it via the UI and that requires my to do it manually per project.

You can modify the .settings/*prefs files and then do a full rebuild if it doesn't happen automatically.

Markus has already set this option to warning for JDT/UI while fixing bug 439874.

Moving to JDT/Debug.

We have too many warnings showing up. I will let this pass for now.

Happy to provide patches for JDT/core for this, if you willing to accept them.

FYI: Bug 434788 comment 3 shows how to fix them in batch even without a Cleanup.
Resolved from JDT UI and JDT Debug.
JDT Core changes are being tracked by Bug 473178
