If you invoke a QuickFix on an uncaught exception inside a catch block, the 
QuickFix will call the exception "e" even if the exception of the outer catch 
block is already named "e". This applies to "Add a catch clause" as well if 
the catch clause ends up inside another catch clause.

Build 2.1-M5
Not critical enough for 2.1 (code base is froozen for 2.1, only critical bugs 
will be fixed).
Not for 2.1. 
Reopening...
This got fixed a long time ago.
