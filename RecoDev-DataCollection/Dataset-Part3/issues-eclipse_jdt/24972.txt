- start "Change Method Signature" wizard
- add a nee parameter
- press "Edit..." button
Observe: label above text field says: Enter a new name for parameter '':
The two single-quotes look like a single double quote.
I suggest to use something like 'Enter a name for new parameter' in this case.

If the parameters a and b in the following method
     void foo(int a, int b)
are swapped with the "Change Method Signature" refactoring,
any comments (next to the parameters) in calls to this method aren't swapped.

So something like
     foo(0 /* was 1 */, 2)
becomes
     foo(2 /* was 1 */, 0)

Since comments are sometimes used to document a parameter, the refactoring should 
try to rearrange the comments too.
any way to achieve this with rewrites?
fixed now
