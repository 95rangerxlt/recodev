M3 Test candidate

package p;

import static java.lang.System.out;

public class B extends A {
	public void foo() {
		out.print(false);
	}
}


Pull up foo into A. Observe: the static import is left in B and not added to A.
Push Down seems to be affected as well. 

Tobias, we should make a path over all refactorings to check how the deal with
static imports. IMO inline method will be affected as well.
