The Call Hierarchy now allows to be opened on a type in which case it lists the constructors as callers. This is wrong.

Markus explained that this is a handy workaround to start with all constructors. If we really want this then we should simply feed the call hierarchy with all these constructors as roots and not show the type.

Fix

Umbrella fix:
- allows to open the call hierarchy on multiple elements
- does not show type as root but directly shows the types' constructors (except for classes with only a default constructor, where the type is used as a stand-in for the missing Java element for the constructor
- removes "callers" of non-static initializers (used to be constructors, bug 207945)
- Open Call Hierarchy Action shows info message if invoked on invalid target in editor (interface, annotation), bug 96945
Fixed in HEAD.
