I don't really know if this is part of the UI or the Core or Text component... I
guessed UI now. Please don't hit me if I guessed wrong :o)

This does not really stop me from using Eclipse, which is in my eyes a really
useful und well design piece of software. (Yes, I really like it.) So I made
severity to be minor, although I often find it annoying what I am going to
describe below.

So here is what happens:
Scenario is: Eclipse finds an error in my code (or a warning...) and shows the
mark on the left side of the editor. 

1. I click on this mark. 
2. Eclipse shows me a list of possible actions which it can do to correct or
improve my code.
3. I am happy. Now I think about, which action I want to select.
4. I move my mouse a little away from the mark.
5. ZOOOM! Suddenly the application, which I was using right before Eclipse,
springs into my view and gets the focus. (for example Mozilla or the cygwin bash
or something else...)
6. I click on Eclipse to regain the focus. (The list of possible actions is
closed again, as part of the changed-focus-incident.)
7. goto 1.

To really select an action I have to be very quick. I need to select the action
before eclipse gives its focus away. If you need to practice using your mouse
quick and precise, this is for you :). I would actually prefer to have time.

Another information: Eclipse gives the focus away as soon as the mouse pointer
leaves the area over the mark. If I just leave the mouse over the mark, the
following happens:
1. I click on the mark.
2. The list of possible actions shows up.
3. I leave the mouse pointer over the error mark at the side of the editor pane.
4. The list of actions vanishes after some timeout.
5. When I move the mouse now, Eclipse keeps focus as normal. But the list of
actions is gone also, so this doesn't really help me here :).

What I would like to have:
1. Eclipse should in no case give the focus to other applications. Those other
applications can and should aquire their focus themselves.
2. Please keep the list of actions open and remove the timeout. Close the list
only when I click somewhere else in the editor or the workspace.

Thank you :-)

Or: please tell me where to find the code (which component, which class and
which methods...), then I will try to find and fix it myself, because it annoys
me so much. Eclipse is just too huge - I get lost without guidance :).

Have a nice day.
Daniel

PS: this refers to Eclipse 2.1 RC2. I don't know RC3(a) yet.

PS: this refers to Eclipse 2.1 RC2. I don't know RC3(a) yet.
This can't be reproduce using RC3a. But I doubt that this is an Eclipse 
problem at all. Daniel, do you have any special screen/desktop manager 
installed. Something that gives foxus to the Window the mouse hovers over. The 
window that pops up is a top level shell.
No, I don't use this kind of desktop managing software. And it does not give the
focus away when the mouse ENTERS the action-list-popup, instead it gives the
focus away as soon as the mouse LEAVES the little mark.

I don't have similar behaviour in any other application, so I doubt that my
system is the bad guy here :o). I can reproduce it on the Windows2000 machine in
the company where I work as well. So it is not just my machine.

But I am gonna try RC3a now, maybe that solved the problem. Stay tuned :-D
Ok, I tried it. Although I probably should have tried earlier. :)
Problem is gone in RC3a.

Anyway: I still don't like that the action list vanishes. Can you add an option
somewhere, so that I can switch off the timeout?

That seems to me more like a feature request, so I set the the state to fixed.

Sorry for raising a bug which wasn't there any more. Damn.

Have a nice day,
Daniel
