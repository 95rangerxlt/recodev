When view a resource project (i.e. non-Java) in the Sync view when using compressed folder, the Java content provider is somehow asked to provide a label and only provides a single segment instead of the project relative path. This is probably related to the use of pipelining (i.e. I recall that pipelining prevented the CN framework from being able to determine the proper model to ask for the label.

Patch to JDT/UI

This patch to JDT/UI will prevent the Java label provider from providing a label for any folder that is a child of the project in the display tree but is not a child in the model. Because Java doesn't provide a label, the CNF will ask the resource label provider. We know that the Resource label provider is active in this case since it is the only provider that puts a nested folder as a direct child of the project.
Moving to JDT/UI to consider path. This is a less general fix for the problem outlined in bug 153912.
