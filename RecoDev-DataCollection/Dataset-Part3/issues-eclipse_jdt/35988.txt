It would be nice to have visual feedback in the Java Browsing Perspective of 
what types are @deprecated without having to read the source javadocs. Same 
for the members view (maybe packages would be too much). This could be 
displayed in the icon, or the node could be of a lighter color compared to the 
others (but not the disabled color). Perhaps this is configurable too, show 
me/don't show me, show me this way (color).

Thank you for considering this request.

Good suggestion
Thanks. Has this request been considered recently? I keep on running into cases
where this would be very useful. In particular, in browsing Apache libraries,
which, for some projects contain APIs that change/deprecate quite a bit from
release to release.
I think this has been included in 3.0M9?? (Icons are slashed).
Correct. This got fixed for 3.0
