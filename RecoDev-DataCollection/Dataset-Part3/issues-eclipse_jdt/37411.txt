If you try and open a class file (typically via a JAR file on the classpath), 
Eclipse either shows the source code (if attached), or provides a list of all 
the fields, methods, etc, along with a button that lets you attach the source.  
While this read-only "editor" is useful, it would be far better if the editor 
showed the bytecodes for each of the methods, just like VAME used to do.  If I 
remember correctly, the VAME editor even rendered some limited comments in the 
bytecodes.

Showing the bytecodes should also be possible for code that the developer has 
written himself, and not limited to class files without source.  Being able to 
read the bytecodes is often a useful tool.

Either the Java editor could be made into a multi-page editor ("Source" 
and "Bin" perhaps), or else an editor could be created that allows the 
bytecodes to be seen.  The bytecode editor would clearly be read-only and would 
be accessed via the "Open With" context menu.

This issue seems to have been addressed in 3.3M2...

"The Java class file editor now shows the disassembled bytecodes when source code is not available."
Yes your feature is partly there now i.e. for class files. For written code it is possible via workaround by copying the file into a class folder.

There are currently no plans to add this to the CU editor.
Thanks Daniel... Just being able to see the bytecodes of .class files for which you don't have source is typically enough.

On the rare occasion where you wish to see the bytecodes of the Java source you've written you can either open a binary JAR or revert to using javap as shipped with the JDK.

I think we should consider this one RESOLVED/FIXED in Target Mileston 3.3M2, but I'll leave that for you to change.  Thanks again.

Thanks Simon.
