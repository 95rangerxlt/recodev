We bogusly created an AST on every selection change. This got fixed and 
released to head. Clicking in the outliner is now fast again (you see no 
redrawing, ....).

Still open is how much time is spend in participant enablement (e.g XML 
interpretation). Will do some measurement. 
Time spend to compute processor availability is between 0 and 10ms. Added 
additional optimizations to consider last used processors first and to stop as 
soon as one processor is available.
