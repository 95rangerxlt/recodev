BETA_JAVA8:

This bug is to track the work in the JDT debugger for supporting Java 8.
Please treat this as the top level umbrella ER and raise unit level tasks
as separate CR/ERs and link them to this as blockers.

At the outset, it would appear that the task is two folds:

    1. Against a recent JRE (8b115 as of today) verify/ensure that all
existing debugger tests are green.

    2. Add support for debugging Java 8 constructs. I don't see 308, 269,
JEP120 having any effect on the debugger - other than to perhaps verify that
they are properly tolerated in snippets. For JSR335, we need to ensure that
stepping through, breakpoints, inspection of values etc work as expected.
For JEP118, verify that the debugger is able to avail and expose the parameter
names.

Jesper, Don't hesitate to reach out to me, Jay or Mike for any help with set up,
getting started etc. Good luck and many thanks for offering to work on this.
I updated the Java 8 branch + a few test items: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.debug.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=65216f72e00d3e25e9e042231474837d7ceb76b5

Once we fix / confirm that features are working, can we make sure to update the wiki: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Debug/Java8 ?
