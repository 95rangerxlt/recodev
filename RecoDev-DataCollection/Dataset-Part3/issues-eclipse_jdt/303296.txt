In the Breakpoints view, I can't copy breakpoint labels any more. I only get "org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaLineBreakpoint@fe1ead0". This worked fine in 3.5.1.

Copy/Paste of breakpoints between breakpoint working sets still works.

Need to upgrade to the virtual copy operation, of course.
Fixed in HEAD. Note that I found bug 306250, which also happens in the BP view when copying breakpoints from different groups.

Please verify, Pawel.
