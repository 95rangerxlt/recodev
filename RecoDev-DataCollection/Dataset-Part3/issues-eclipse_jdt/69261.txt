The method TestSearchEngine.hasSuiteMethod(IType) does not consider the return 
type of suite methods to be implementations of ITest. It returns true on any 
class being public and having a public static suite() method.

If you have implemented a class different than a JUnit test suite, but having a 
public static suite() method, you will have the "Run" -> "JUnit Test" action in 
the context menu available. Invoking the action will cause an error (a 
ClassCastException in the 3.0 version?).

Usually this will not be likely to happen, but e.g. when using the JDemo 
framework (www.jdemo.de), there are suite methods like this:
  
  public static IDemo suite() {
    DemoSuite suite = new DemoSuite("Demo for de.jdemo.examples.awt");
    //$JDemo-BEGIN$
    suite.addDemo(new DemoSuite(AwtDemoCaseUsageDemo.class));
    //$JDemo-END$
    return suite;
  }

In the JDemo plugin there are launch shortcuts for demo suites as well as there 
are launch shortcuts for test suites in the JUnit plugin. So the problem is very 
annoying when using both plugins.

TestSearchEngine is defined in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.util.
Moving to JDT UI for comments.
