Untested patch from Anirbhan

[Please use bugzilla to attach patches. Discussion on work in progress
should be on bugzilla]
Some comments/meta comments:

1. Patches should always be generated after synching with the repository so
they cleanly apply. The present patch fails to apply.

2. A patch should not contain extraneous changes, noise diffs, needless
formatting changes etc. The present patch contains changes to ReferenceBinding,
TypeBinding, ProblemReasons etc which are not relevant at all.

3. We don't want to leave in stale code in comment blocks. Where they are
really useless, let us get rid of them.

4. MethodVerifier#computeSubstituteMethod(MethodBinding inheritedMethod, MethodBinding currentMethod) should not have been retained at all !!!
MethodVerifier15's computeSubstituteMethod is pulled up a static method
with an extra argument, so calls through instances will bind to
1.4 behavior which would be wrong !

5. All modified files should reflect updated copyright.

I have made these changes and the tests are green. I'll post a patch
shortly.
Fix released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=5deead051fd76da1bc6ad122fc16f2ab2fddd2ef. Thanks Anirbhan
for your first fix.
