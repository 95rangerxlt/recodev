build I20021204

I tried using drag and drop in the outline to reorder methods in a CU 
(FilteredList.java).  I saw two problems:

1. it always copies, resulting in errors
  - it should move unless I have Ctrl held down
  - this should work the same whether copying/moving in the same CU or between 
CUs
  - need proper feedback in the cursor for this too (show plus for copy, but 
not for move)

2. if I drag a method at the end of the list earlier in the CU, it is 
positioned correctly in the source, but both occurrences are listed at the end 
in the outline (I have sort by name turned off)
  - the outline should always reflect the order in the source

To make the case more concrete: 
- FilteredList.java had several accessor methods at the end of the CU
- it originally had all get methods first, followed by the set methods
- I wanted to rearrange them so that the get/set methods were paired
- I dragged the first set method up to be under the matching get method
- repeat for the remaining items


Currently there isn't any support for reordering methods in the Outline view 
(and there aren't any plans to support this for 2.1). 

IMO the fedback is correct using M4. It is as follows:

- start D&D in outline view
- feedback is Copy
- press Shift to turn DnD operation into Move
- feedback is Stop sign indicating that move is not allowed.

Couldn't reproduce the problem described under item 2.

Moving to later since no action is planned for 2.1. Nick, please move back to 
inbox if you disagree.
I confirm that the feedback is correct: it shows the plus.
I must admit that I didn't notice this the first time though - I just assumed 
that unshifted drag is a move.
But this can wait.

WE should think about supporting rearranging methods via DnD. I used it in 
WSAD for HTML files in tables and it was very handy.
.
Methods can now be rearranged. There's one remaining feedback problem, see bug 72807.
