I have a project that has a factory path that includes an external jar.  The 
jar file does not exist on the hard drive.

Project specific settings *are* enabled, and "enable annotation processing" is 
disabled.

Upon launching Eclipse, I get an exception, and an error is logged: "Could not 
load from jar: The system cannot find the file specified."

I wonder, is there supposed to be a filename after "jar:"?

Expected: if annotation processing is disabled, we should not attempt to load 
the jars on the project's factory path.  Missing jars should either be ignored 
or treated as a warning - personally, I prefer the former option.
