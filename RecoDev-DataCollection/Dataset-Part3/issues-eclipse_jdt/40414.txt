I200307160800

I do not have steps to reproduce the problem.

Every now and then, when I click on the Outline view, the associated Java 
editor does not scroll to show the method I have clicked on.

If I close the Outline view and reopen it, the problem does not go away.
If I close the Java editor and reopen it, the problem goes away.

Clicking on a different Java editor does not fix the problem.

There is no .log entry created.

I will attatch my configuration details.

configuration details
Happens every time I open an editor on a java file using the Open Type tool 
item.
Works for me in 20030717 with a new and an old workspace. Need to investigate 
your settings in detail.
Can be reproduced by disabling
Preferences > Java > Editor > Synchronize Outline view selection...

This preference is on by default.

Workaround is to enable above preference
