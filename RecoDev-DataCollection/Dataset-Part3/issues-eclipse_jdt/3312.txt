I was running a workspace taken from Adam in ZRH.  I added a new project, and 
added a
local copy of rt.jar to the classpath (because JRE_LIB wasn't pointing to 
anything).
After running for awhile I noticed maybe a hundred copies of the following 
message
on the console (nothing in log, but I may have restarted, thus deleting the old 
log):

Warning: internal error: attempt to add duplicate package fragment in image 
builder: D:/eclipse/jre/lib/rt.jar

NOTES:

JohnA (6/18/2001 2:40:15 PM)
	Reproduced in a new workbench, it occurs if rt.jar appears twice on the 
classpath.
	These messages are generated by a println in PackageMapEntry#addFragment
(IPath).

PM (6/19/2001 11:25:07 AM)
	Those messages were already in during the techpreview era.

PM (6/19/2001 11:50:33 AM)
	Should be fixed up.
