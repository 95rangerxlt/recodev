With the addition of Go Into support in the Project Explorer, it is necessary to get the description of the JavaModel object (which is what the Package Explorer does in a hardwired manner).  The Project Explorer cannot do something similar, and has to resolve it through the normal label provider mechanism.

A workaround was put in the ProjectExplorer class with bug 262606.

To remove the workaround, see the lines in the ProjectExplorer that refer to bug 262606 and remove them.

I'm not sure if the IJavaModel should be the parent of an IJavaProject at all (I thought we use the workspace root, but I may be wrong). For M6.
The reason why the tool tip is so ugly/big are two bugs in the CNF, see bug 262883 for details.
Currently getParent() for an I(Java)Project either returns the real input or IJavaModel. This might also be an issue when going into a Java Project and then up again (depending on how the frame story is implemented).

Returning the workspace root would fix the label.
Fixed in HEAD of JavaNavigatorContentProvider.
Released removal of hack in ProjectExplorer to HEAD (3.5M6)
