I200411170800

I have a nonstatic inner class which calls an instance method of the enclosing
top-level class. 'Refactor > Move Member Type to New File' presents a wizard
which asks for an enclosing instance field name. The name is prefilled.

The OK button is disabled, although user input is complete.
Workaround: change and then revert the proposed name.
