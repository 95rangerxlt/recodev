Can you be a little bit more specific 
(see http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/bugs.html):

- which menu doesn't work anymore ?
- does the menu pop up, but you can't select something ?
- can you select, but the action does nothing ?

Is there anything in the log. 
In a Java Perspective we can see the Package Explorer View (list of all java
packages available for a java project). 
In this bug the "Menu" (the right button "down arrow" in toolbar view) doesn't
pop up anymore and u cannot see "select working set", sort, filter, layout etc...
whereas "Menu" of Navigator View works.

Do you have steps to reproduce ? 

Is the anything in the .log file. You can find the log file in the .metadata 
directory of your workspace. 
Created attachment 15084

For your information 
i have use 
-------------------
java version "1.5.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0-b64)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0-b64, mixed mode)

may be it is can help you
The problem is caused by a contributed working set that doesn't provide an 
image for the menu entry. Do you have additional plug-ins installed ?

I have protected our code against this and released a fix for I20041012
