There's currently no way to just turn off code folding. There's a preference to not use code folding for 
*new* editors, but then each currently open editor has to be configured manually. This is extremely 
tedious.

I'd suggest that the current preference should be changed to just "disable code folding" period. I don't 
understand why anyone would only want to turn the preference off for the future. Even if there are 
people who want to do this, I have a hard time imagining that they're in the majority. :-)

If the current preference has to be kept as it is for some reason, though, can we at least get a new 
option?

Being able to enable/disable a feature for all editors is a valid request.

Note: this is the same when changing Quick Diff preferences. We should keep them
in sync.

this has been fixed a while ago: line numbers, folding, quick diff are global
preferences, there is no per-editor setting any longer.
