Internal compiler error: java.lang.StackOverflowError at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.ParameterizedTypeBinding.isProperType(ParameterizedTypeBinding.java:808)
I'll take a look.
Thanks for the concise test!

StackOverflow happened on a RawTypeBinding, which refers to itself as its type argument. I didn't realize we'd do that kind of thing - interesting.

Test & fix released via http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core.git/commit/?h=BETA_JAVA8&id=a31c93b5766a8dd2394653e84911d8b97129bcfe
Thanks for being so fast!
When will the fix be available in Eclipse as "Check for updates" ?
Updates are refreshed daily, so the fix should appear tomorrow, I'd expect.
Thanks, I tested the fix and this problem is now corrected.
I have filled a new bug for another problem, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425951
