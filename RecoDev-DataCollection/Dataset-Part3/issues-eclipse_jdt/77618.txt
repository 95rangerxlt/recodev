The current dialog is a little bit confusing. One idea to improve it is:

Case field is required:

Field name: [             ]
Make final: [ ]

OK button is disabled when field name is missing

Case field is optional

Field name (optional): [                   [
Make final [ ]

Ok button is always enabled and make final is disabled if name field is empty

Agreed, perhaps we could emphasize that the field is necessary with an 
additional info status message.
Agree on the info status message.
