M2 testing

If the cursor is placed at an element that does not contain documentation, the
view does not update and the documentation of the previous element is kept.

I think this is very confusing: If you don't follow the updating of the view,
you don't realize that the doc does not correspond to the current element. You start
reading and find out that this makes no sense. See also bug 40301, that the
current element should be rendered prominently on the first line.

An Idea might to be a 'lock' button on the view tool bar: If it is pressed, the
view does then not follow the selection.

Lock button a good idea but I'd better like a view menu which allows to set:
[] Keep old element if new input is invalid
