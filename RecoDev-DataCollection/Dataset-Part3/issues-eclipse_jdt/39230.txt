Present implementation of F1 help popup dialog is using something like html
rendered page with number of links to some resources. It is ok to use mouse to
select particular link, but keyboard navigation is pretty much inconvenient and
different from all of the other popups (i.e. quick fix or code completion) you
forced to use tab/shift-tab instead of up/down keys.

My suggestion is to change F1 popup window to use list widget instead html
rendered page.

For java editor it will be also convenient to have context help for the selected
element at the beggining of the list (opposite to the current position at the
end of list).

Keyboard navigation of infopop is already reported in help bug 33778 (this is 
dup).

Infopop is not HTML.  The related links are implemented SWT labels.
There is a plan item bug 37677 to use HTML for infopops.  I do not see a 
reason why not.

Your last point - deciding which (first or last) releted link is for selected 
java element is in JDT team domain, I think.  I will transfer your request 
(this bug) for them to look at.
Any chance to get this enhancement implemented in 3.1 release?
Changing the title from
[Help] F1 help popup dialog in editors should have better keyboard navigation
to
[Help] F1- Make related link to Javadoc the first one
as this is the only thing reported hare that is not implemented in 3.0.
The popup has been replaced by a Help view but you can currently not use the
keyboard to navigate, see bug 85276.

We'd like to put the Javadoc stuff in a separate section, see bug 85278.

Setting to REMIND until other bugs are resolved.

Fixed.
Released into I20050217-1600.
