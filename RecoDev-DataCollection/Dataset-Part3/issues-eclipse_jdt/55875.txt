Reorg: Move (and Copy) internal JAR not possible if the target doesn't contain a
source folder or of the folder is on the Java build path

Expected:
1. it should allow to drop it in any container
2. it should add the JAR to the Java build path and define an exclusion filter

In I20070710-1416 I can move and copy a jar which is not on the BP into any kind of folder. I can not move (but copy) a jar which is on the BP, which is acceptable if not correct. 

What is an internal JAR? Why should it add the jar to the BP and what should the 
exclusion filter exclude?

Setting to works for me, reopen if you have steps to reproduce.
Important part is to use DnD.
The only java element which can be dropped onto a non java element is a ICompilationUnit

You're killing me Dani;-)

I will allow to drop an archive IPackageFragementRoot onto a IJavaProject, which will add it to the drop targets BP. But for request 1 refer to bug 31125
