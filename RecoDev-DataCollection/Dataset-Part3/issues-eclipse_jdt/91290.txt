Build: I20050413

We have a class and an interface with the same name:

Interface: org.osgi.service.prefs.PreferencesService
Class: org.eclipse.core.internal.preferences.PreferencesService

1) Open the type dialog and type in "PreferencesService"
2) Tab to second pane
3) Down arrow to select the class instead of the interface

-> Observe the package field at the bottom still indicates that the interface is
selected.

4) Hit Enter to open the type

-> The interface is opened instead.  It is somehow not updating the package list
when the class name is unchanged.

The dialog will go away and will be replace with a one pane version. 
No problem anymore with the new open type dialog.
