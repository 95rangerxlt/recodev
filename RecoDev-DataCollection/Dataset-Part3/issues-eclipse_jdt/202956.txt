Currently all APT problem markers appear top-level in the Problems view's filter dialog. They should be grouped under 'APT Problems'.

Possible Fix
*** Bug 207533 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
In addition to grouping these, we should also fix the text to better fit the sense of the dialog.
Renamed to clarify the distinctions (a bit), and grouped together.  In addition to the markers that Dani's patch included, I've also included the problem marker from org.eclipse.jdt.apt.pluggable.core.
