The failure does not happen every time, but it is easy enough to reproduce - at least 1 out of 3 test runs fails. This happens only on Linux, I cannot reproduce this on windows.

Basically when I run the test, it just gets stuck at one point. To figure out where I wrote some debug code (patch attached) and this was the console output

-------------------------------------------------------
RUNS = 3
0 run
find: e
Tab
replace: x
replace all via mnemonic - keydown
replace all via mnemonic - the key
replace all via mnemonic - keyup
close the dialog.

condition() : true
stopping performance meter
reverting editor
join background activities
1 run
find: e
Tab
replace: x
replace all via mnemonic - keydown
replace all via mnemonic - the key
------------------------------------------------------

While the number of runs is not fixed, but it always gets stuck at the same line - "SWTEventHelper.pressKeyChar(display, 'a');" in AbstractJavaReplaceAllTest. The screen keeps flickering, it looks like 'a' (mnemonic for 'Replace All' button) is pressed continuously. (If I manage to open a text editor and get the focus in it, 'a' is entered into it continuously)


Bug 330353 says that the following exception occured on the build server. I am not sure if the 2 problems are the same, but the one mentioned above happens quite frequently on my local machine.

debug code 1

I debugged a bit more and here is the console output for the attached debug code. Essentially the test gets stuck in SWTEventHelper.postEvent(Display, Event, boolean), right after calling "display.post(event)" (though this call succeeds and returns true)

The javadoc for display.post(event) says - "Note that this operation can fail when the operating system fails to generate the event for any reason.  For example, this can happen when there is no such key or mouse button or when the system event queue is full". 

Plus if I fiddle with the UI (to look at the console output, try to take a thread dump, or even just bring focus to the main eclipse workbench) the test becomes unstuck and I get the exception from comment 0 - at least this confirms that the test getting stuck and the exception are the same problem.
