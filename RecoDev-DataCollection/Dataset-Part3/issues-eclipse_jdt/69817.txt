Eclipse 3.0

Externalize a string containing escaped characters "\r\n\t\f". The cell editor
on the table shows only "square" characters insted of the escape sequences. Said
characters should not be translated when editing strings.

They are (correctly) not changed when written to the .properties file without
change.

Wind/Unwind escape characters in the celleditor

This probably should move to the NLSSubstitution but I was reusing code you
already had available.

Thanks a lot, Michael. Sorry for the late release, I lost track of the bug
report. Too many reports in my inbox....
