build I20041207

- use incremental search (Ctrl+J) to find some text that has multiple matches in
the document
- Ctrl+J again to advance to the second match
- when the second match is found, switch directions using Ctrl+Shift+J
- it should go to the previous match, but instead it just moves the caret to the
other beginning of the same selection
- Ctrl+J again
- likewise, it doesn't advance to the next match, it just moves the caret back
to the end of the selection

I believe this is a regression.

This has been fixed a while ago.
