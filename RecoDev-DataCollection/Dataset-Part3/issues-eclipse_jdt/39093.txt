one cannot initialise arrays in complex statements because the opening brace is
put at the end of the line when you want it to be where you're typiing.

e.g.

assume you wish to call this method:
void foo(String[] array) ...

you use ctrl space to complete the method call (| = cursor):

foo(|)

start typing: new String[] {

you will get:

foo(new String[]) {|

the opening brace is put at the end.

seems to be fixed.
