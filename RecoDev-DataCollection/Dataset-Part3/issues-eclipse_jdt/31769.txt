i'm running a test class with 95 tests
i have junit as a fast view
in the middle of it running, i resized the view a bit, which made the progress 
bar jump immediately to 100% and stay there (the numbers were still ticking 
correctly)

don't know if it's junit or swt

patch

the problem was apparently a typo where the color bar was scaled using a
presentation and not model value
in controlResized
fX= scale(fX); //it does not make sense - bar should be scaled with model
values

i fixed the bug, renamed fields so that their names are more meaningful now and

removed an empty dispose listener

patch attached
released patch
