Open any class in the Java editor. Don't touch the outliner.
Scroll to the bottom of the file and pretend that you're editing the last 
method.
Select the outliner, but DON'T select any items in it; for example, click in 
the title bar of the outliner.
Result: the "package" line in the outliner is automatically selected on focus 
in, which causes my text editor to scroll to the beginning of the file.

Looks like the outliner has the logic to select the first item when there is no 
selection.
Could not reproduce in F2. Please reopen if necessary.
