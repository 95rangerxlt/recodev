It appears when I try to use an anonymous class. For example:

mTable.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter())
 
Now, I want to open the brace. So it should look like this: 
 
mTable.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter(){)
 
but instead, it looks like this:
 
mTable.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()){
 
So I have to delete the last brace:
 
mTable.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()
 
and then:
 
mTable.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
});

Smart brace does not handle a number of situations as it is currently based on 
the code for smart semicolon. 

The brace insertion code is now being reworked to address the following 
problems:

- Array initializers, when editing existing code (bug 39093)
- Anonymous class definitions, when the closing parenthesis of a call already 
exists (this bug)
- changing a one-line if statement to one with a block
    if (true) doStuff(); 
---> 
    if (true) {
        doStuff();
    }

- Additional spaces are currently always inserted, resulting in an extra space 
for some scenarios.

- does not honor code format settings.

patches for SmartSemicolonAutoEditStrategy.java, JavaAutoIndentStrategy.java, plus TestCase

The zip contains:

- patch for SmartSemicolonAutoEditStrategy.java (which also handles smart
brace)
    - contains heuristics for smart semicolon and smart brace (not AST based in
order to handle incomplete code)
    - does not honor code style preferences yet
    - supports the use cases reported above

- patch for JavaAutoIndentStrategy.java 
    - it's a quick hack 
    - handles anonymous classes and brace closing better when there is content
behind an inserted opening brace

- SmartSemicolonAutoEditStrategyTest.java
    - unsure where to put this...

not the other patches.

Changes:
- added support for method declarations with array return type
- added support for synchronized and static blocks
