The Override/Implement Methods dialog says:

Insertion Point:
- First Method
- Last Method
- a()
- b()
...

I *never* know whether that means before or after the selected method.

Better labels would be:

Insert after:
- Class Declaration Header
- a()
- b()
...

or

Insert Before:
- a()
- b()
...
- End of Class

I know what you mean, but

Insert after:

- a()
- b()
...

is also very ugly and it doesn't address the 'last' and 'cursor position' point



OK, and what's bad about 'Insert Before:'?

> it doesn't address the 'last' and 'cursor position' point

Currently, either 'first' or 'last' is redundant (I can't remember which one).
If we e.g. take 'Insert Before:', then 'first' is equal to the first method.

I don't see what's bad about "Insert Before: Cursor Position". 'Cursor Position'
could either be the first entry, or (preferred) between the member before and
the member after the cursor.

I can very well insert something before or after the cursor position - the
result is the same.
Changed the entry labels of methods to
'After 'foo()''
