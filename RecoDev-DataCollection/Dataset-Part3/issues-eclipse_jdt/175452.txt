Add a context function to the Javadoc view to open the page/a hyperlink in an external web browser.
Why go to the Javadoc view at all then? Simply press Shift+F2 in the editor.
There are two situations where such a function would be usedful:

1. A Javadoc location has not been defined. Javadoc works, Shift+F2 doesn't.
2. Starting from Javadoc you have followed some hyperlinks and found an interesting article. You want to open this article in an external browser in order to keep it when the Javadoc content changes due to a selection changes.
