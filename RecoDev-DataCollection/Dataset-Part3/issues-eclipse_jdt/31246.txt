In the Java Code I wanna type 'System.out.println' I type in the following

Syste

hit CTRL+Space and a list appears. Since 'System' is the requested one, I type '.' which will be completed as 'System.'  BUT no further Code Assist is displayed.

1) The Code Assist should be displayed.

2) When type 'System.o' + CTRL+SPACE => Code assist with only one selection. In the Preferences->Editor->CodeAssist the option 'Insert single proposal automatical' is checked! => Why is not out automatically completed resp. Code Assist will be reopened again?

BTW: The options of the Code Assist are the default options, ie all are marked except 'Present proposal ...' and 'Fill argument names ...'

Are there any news about this issue? Reproducable, bug or not, will be fixed or not?
