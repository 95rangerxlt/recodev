I'm using the Externalize Strings wizard on a Java source file. I have assigned 
a state to each string it found: translate:26, never translate:144, and skip:8. 

When I proceed through the wizard, it says I have three errors of this 
type: "Key must not be empty."

Back on the first page of the wizard, I can't find any strings in 
the "translate" state that have empty keys. I think the wizard has a bug.

But even if it's true that I have strings with empty keys, the error display is 
not helpful in letting me find the keys that are empty. It should display the 
string in question, so I can go back to the first page and find that string and 
fix its key. It could also display a string number which corresponds to the 
first page of the wizard (which should also show string numbers), so I can 
scroll to the right place in the (possibly very long) list of strings.

I have a reproducing case - happens every time:

1. Right click a Java source file with some strings in it.
2. Choose Source / Externalize Strings.
3. Erase the key for the first string - delete the "0" character so it's blank
4. THEN click "Never Translate" to change this entry to that state.
5. Now click Next twice - see the "Key must not be empty" error message.

You can correct this by changing the state of this string back to "Translate," 
then give it a dummy key string, then click "Never Translate" for it.

But in the general case you can't work around this because you can't tell which 
is the offending string.

The PRIMARY bug here is that you demand a non-empty key for a string whose 
state is "Never Translate" or "Skip." 

The SECONDARY bug is that in the error report view, you don't show which string 
is causing the error.

Created attachment 9601
Only check keys which are translated
Created attachment 9608
show value as context for empty string

This has a modified version for the verify translated keys only.
The best I could think of when you have an empty key was to provide the value
as the context.  It would be nicer to have some indication on the first panel
when these things are invalid or at least some number so you can provide an
easy correlation.
This got fixed for I20040427. If a string is skipped it will not be consider 
in testing.
