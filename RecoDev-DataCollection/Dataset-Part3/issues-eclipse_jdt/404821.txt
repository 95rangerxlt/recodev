"Correct Indentation" doesn't indent a default method. It even removes the indentation here:

public interface DefaultMethod {
	void bar();

	default void foo() {
		System.out.println("foo");
	}
}

The code formatter is fine.

Patch

The reason that "Code Indentation" did not work for default methods was that the keyword 'default' was considered only in the context of switch statement in JavaIndenter.

The patch checks the next token after 'default'. If it is a ':', only then 'default' will be considered in the context of switch.

Added test cases in JavaHeuristicScannerTest as testDefaultMethod1() and testDefaultMethod2().
Also, fixed compile warnings in JavaHeuristicScannerTest due to the use of junit.framework.Assert.

Dani/Markus, please review.
Sounds good, but Dani knows more about JDT Text than I.
