The file included below compiles fine with JDK 1.3.1_01, but I get this error 
on line 17 when compiling with Eclipse 2.0 build 20011206:

The member type Factory cannot be declared static; static types can only be 
declared in static or top level types

--- source file Member.java ---
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Iterator;

public interface Member extends Serializable
{

    public abstract static class Type //extends AbstractValueMap
    {

	private Type()
        {
        }

        public interface Group extends Serializable
        {

            public final static class Factory
            {
                private Factory()
                {
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Changed the static modifier check to allow this scenario (member interfaces are 
treated as static).
Fixed
