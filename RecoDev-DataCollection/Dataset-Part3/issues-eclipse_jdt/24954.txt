The destination of the constant is currently always a field in the closest type.
I can think of other useful destinations such as:

  * some super type
  * some surrounding type
  * local variable

Consider the following case:

void foo() {
  final int MAGIC= 42;
  int result = MAGIC * 7;
}

1) I could select '7' and extract constant as another local variable.

2) I could select 'MAGIC * 7' and the only possible destination would be
   a local variable.
