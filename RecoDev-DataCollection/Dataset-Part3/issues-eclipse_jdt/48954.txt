To create a new profile I have to create a new one first. I would like to edit
an existing one and maybe even override it. This would also be more consistent
with what we have:
- I can change a predefined perspective and save it under that name
- I can edit existing templates and either save it under that name or a new one

No further action planned.
Wrong resolution.
Got fixed. 

you can now edit a default profile and save it under a different name.
