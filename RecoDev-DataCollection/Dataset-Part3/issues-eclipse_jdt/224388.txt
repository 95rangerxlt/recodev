Not sure if the Java editor has an extended dictionary, or what your policy is for adding words to the dictionary, but the new tags from our API tooling are flagged as spelling errors while general Javadoc tags aren't.

I can add them (no extension point for that).

Olivier, can you give me the tags with their syntax?
@noinstantiate
@noreference
@noimplement
@noextend

These are the four tags we are using so far. They all have a description behind.
