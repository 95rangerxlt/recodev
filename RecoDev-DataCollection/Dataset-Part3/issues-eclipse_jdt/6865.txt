1. Use the plugin importer to import all of the projects in binary form
2. Open Type on BuildNotifier - select the one in newBuilder.
3. Select various types and methods.
Util binds to corba, not to the one imported.
IMarker doesn't bind to anything.
(The corresponding methods cannot be found either)

Suspecting the classpath of the containing project isn't valid.
Therefore, we revert to a simple type search (per simple name) and method/field 
do not work.

Is the classpath ok ?
If the classpath is invalid, it is a bug in the plugin importer.

This problem also exists in 1122, 1206.
However, this problem does not appear to exist in 1107.
(the plugin importer tool is different, so that 
could be a factor).  I imported the 1211 libraries 
in all cases
*** Bug 6037 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
We think we have isolated the pattern. It can occur when some code previously 
opened a JAR package fragment root in the wrong context (using a handle 
containing the wrong project). Even this package fragment root does not exist, 
its information is cached, and fooling all subsequent queries against elements 
inside it (they will incorrectly think they are located inside the original 
wrong project).

In this scenario, open types is traversing all projects (UI code) to find the 
enclosing projects. It is creating bogus handles to the JAR pkg root, and 
performing an existency check which causes the cache to be populated.

This defect is being resolved by revisiting the existency/opening condition of 
a JAR package fragment root (will be released in next integration build).
