Build: I-20050315

1. I opened the Java build path properties page of my org.eclipse.pde.core 
project
2. switched to the Libraries tab.
3. Added an external library and a workspace library just to see what the 
icons look like.
4. Press Cancel on the dialog.

The changes took effect on my .classpath file and a compilation of the project 
was triggered.
