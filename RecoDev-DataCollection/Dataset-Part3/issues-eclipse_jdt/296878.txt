If a piece of code that throws an exception not declared in the throws clause is quick-fixed, it adds the exception to the throws clause, and also adds an entry to the javadoc. If the javadoc already has a @throws element for that exception, it adds a second, useless one.

Reproducible: Always

Fixed in HEAD.

Example:

package xy;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
public class Try {
    /**
     * @throws FileNotFoundException sometimes
     */
    void foo() {
        new FileInputStream("");
    }
}
Whabam! That's what I call fast. Thanks.
