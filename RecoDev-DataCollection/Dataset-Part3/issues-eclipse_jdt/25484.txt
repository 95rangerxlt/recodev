i should not ba able to enter a space ' ' as a task name because no task like 
that will ever be created.
(we might need a verification routine from jcore)

need verification routine or definition of valid task tag names
JDT/Core doesn't provide validation for any setting. The law is to match the 
spec for setting values, which are simple anyway. 

We could modify the spec to be stricter.


The spec should be more specific and explain what is meant by
'where <tag> is a String without any wild-card'

Space is also a 'wild-card'?
sorry, my question is: there can be spaces inside the name (as long as the 
trimed name is not empty)
updated the validation routine to not allow the task name starting and ending 
with whitespace.

Need to improve the spec to mention whitespaces.
Philippe, do you mean the text on the preference page or the Java doc spec ? 
In the latter it is JDT/Core.
I was meaning my spec. The original problem was yours, and I was incorrectly 
assigned to this defect.
Got addressed in the UI. You can't enter a task name with a ' '.
