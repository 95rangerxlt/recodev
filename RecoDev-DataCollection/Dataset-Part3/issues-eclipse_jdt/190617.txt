If a Java 6 annotation processor is called at all during a build, it is supposed to get called again on the "final round" at the end of the build, with the RoundEnvironment.processingOver() flag set to true.

In the IDE, it appears that this is not happening correctly; processors are not getting a final round.  It does appear to be working in batch mode, although we should add an explicit test for it.

proposed patch

Proposed patch fixes the immediate problem.  However, the test for this in FilerTests still would fail if enabled, because of Bug 200124, Filer.createResource() not implemented.
Released in HEAD and 3.3.1.
