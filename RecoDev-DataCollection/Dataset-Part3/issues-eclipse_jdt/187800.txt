In the Java Editor I have some annotations on the type, and spellchecking errors are showing on some of the values in the annotation.  For example, all instances of "foo" are being marked as spelling errors in the annotation below:

@NamedQuery(name="foo", query = "select foo FROM Customer foo")

It seems like spellchecking should not run on annotations (or should be able to be disabled).

This has been fixed: Java strings are no longer checked out of the box.
