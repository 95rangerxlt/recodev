Hi,

It would be nice if the code Assist function would also offer "this" as 
keyword when guessing method parameters, if the argument type fits the current 
class type. 
For example in: 

fooProvider.addListener(this);

bye

This behavior seems to work for me.

Could you give a more complete test case ?
JDT/UI compute guessing method parameters

Move to JDT/UI
Okay, here goes:

The Idea is that this class inherites from both Observer and Observable, so it
should be able to register itself as an Observer. Thus, CodeCompletion should
guess this.addObserver(this) and this.addObserver(null), while for me, t just
guesses this.addObserver(null). 

--------------------------------------


package de.fgh.iese.decisionmodel.model;

import java.util.Observable;
import java.util.Observer;


public class Selfobserver extends Observable implements Observer {

    public Selfobserver() {
        // try CodeCompletion here *********
        this.addObser
    }


    public void update(Observable o, Object arg) {
    }


}
+1. I am missing this as well.
fixed a while ago.
