Eclipse 3.0rc1 doesnt display the option to update plugins throw the software 
update option.
the view that missing these feature are the java views.
they do appear under other perspectives
Works for me using build I200406082000.
This bug have to be removed.
the way to see the Software update is to use "Customize perspective"
and mark the software update.
