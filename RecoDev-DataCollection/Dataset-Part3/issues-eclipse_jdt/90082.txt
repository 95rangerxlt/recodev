In Eclipse 3.1 (JDT version  I20050219-1500), the wizard for creating a new 
class seems unable to implement generic interfaces while specifying its 
argument.

For example, implementing Comparable<Integer> is impossible; you have to first 
implement Comparable, and then correct the genearted stub for specifying its 
type argument. (in this example, replacing the Object argument of comparesTo by 
Integer.)
