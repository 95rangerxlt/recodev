This will allow to reuse the binding environment. First measures indicate a speedup of 3 to 4 times! It also unifies the implementations.

I did, unfortunately, write the organize imports performance test in such a stupid way that the performance increase will not be visible in the test result. However, the speed up is around 1.5x-2x for large enough projects in a real world scenario.

Nice also how code I've copy-pasted almost 2 years ago is now reunited:-)
