In JUnit 3.8.1 you no longer have to have a TestCase(String testName) 
constructor. The test case creation wizard sould make the creation of this 
constructor optional:

Add a check box to the stubs section whether this constructor should be 
generated (default should be off)

Created attachment 4605
proposed fix. adds checkbox for optionally creating constructor

Checkbox is off by default, but remembers the state last set to
patch seems to be cut off. can you attach it again?
note that you can simplify 'createConstructorControls'. No need to add a
griddata to the parent composite. no need to set the number of columns to 2.
Plz see attachment 25196 for bug 25196 for fix.
Patch is in:

version: 2.1.0
build id: 200304291456
