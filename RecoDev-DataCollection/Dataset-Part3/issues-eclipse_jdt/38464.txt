int i(Object s, int k){
	return k == 3? s.hashCode():3;
}
void f(int p){
	int u= i(null, p);
}

inline i
you get int u= p == 3? null.hashCode():3;
which does not compile

Fixed by putting () around the conditional expression. However I left the 
null.hasCode() thing since it is better to get a compile error than having a 
NPE during runtimen ;-).
