Hi there,

I'm exporting a plugin project as deployable plugin. I receive an error in 
<MyProject>.jar.bin.log as shown below. 

"Missing message: configure.incompatibleComplianceForTarget in: 
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.batch.messages"

I guess I've a configuration problem which is not subject of this bug. I wanted 
to point out, that there might miss a message in a resource file.

Please confirm you are using the Cheetah  (1.5 support).


Fixed in 3.1 stream.
