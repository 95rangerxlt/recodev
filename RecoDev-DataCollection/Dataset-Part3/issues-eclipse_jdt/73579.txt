I got the following error after doing these steps: 

1) create a new java class in the default package called dddd.java, open it
1b) open a second file in an editor
1c) switch back to dddd.java (i.e. make it the active editor)
2) change the encoding for that file to "UTF-16 (little-endian)" from the Edit >
Encoding menu
3) click on the other file in the package explorer to cause the editor to activate
4) click back on dddd.java in the explorer and ... the follow exception is
printed to the console

java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

note: I also have the javadoc view open
There's no message in the UI: the Source view just doesn't go blank i.e. doesn't
update.

Fixed in HEAD.

This is not critical for 3.0.1: the Source view simply shows the source it
showed before (title shows the element that corresponds to that source) and the
Source view is still functional afterwards.
I think an exception that is easy to create and prints to the console is not
acceptable, can you consider this for 3.0.1.
No action for 3.0.1.
