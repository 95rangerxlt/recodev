When I click the Disable All button on the Factory path dialog I can see the checkboxes next to each factory path become un-checked but clicking OK or Apply has no affect. If I re-open the dialog I see my previous changes have not been saved. 

If I click the checkbox next to a factory path with my mouse to disable it then click OK or Apply I get the "would you like to rebuild project" dialog as expected and this works. If I reopen the Dialog and click "Enable All" button and click OK or Apply it has no affect, the factory paths are not enabled.

If I click the checkbox with my mouse next to a fatory path to enable it and click ok or apply this works.

Repro Steps
--------------------
1. Create simple java project
2. Create new package com.testing
3. Create new class Testing
4. Copy paste samepl code into class
5. Add HelloWorld.jar to build path and factory path (attached to this bug)
6. Check there's no build errors
7. Open the Factory path dialog (project properties --> Java Compiler --> Annotation Processing --> Factory Path)
8. Click the Disable All button
9. Click ok
10. Notice there's no build errors
11. Reopen Factory path dialog and see that previous factory paths are still enabled.
12. Try to disable with mouse by clicking checkbox next to factory path, click ok, notice pop up asking for porject rebuild, notice build errors this works
13. Reopen Factory Path dialog click Enable All button, click OK
14. Notice still build errors
15. Reopen Factory Path dialog notice that the factory path is still disabled.


Code Sample
--------------------
package com.testing;

import generatedfilepackage.GeneratedFileTest;
import org.eclipse.jdt.apt.tests.annotations.helloworld.*;


public class Testing {

	
	@HelloWorldAnnotation
	public void myMethod() {
		
		GeneratedFileTest.helloWorld();
		
	}
}

Simple Hello World Annotation processor factory for repro steps

Simple Hello World Annotation processor factory for repro steps. Uses @HelloWorldAnnotation and generates simple java file generatedfilepackage.GeneratedFileTest with one simple static helloWorld() method.
It appears that the CheckedListDialogField class I'm using doesn't call its checkbox state-change listener for the enableAll or disableAll events; it just silently changes the state of the checkbox.  So, I'll have to hook these events with a separate listener.
Fixed in 3.1.2; need to merge to 3.2.
Fixed in 3.2 as well.
