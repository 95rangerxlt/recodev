In PreferenceConstants, we publish all preference constants and describe the 
format of the preference (e.g. comma separated list of ...).
The MembersOrderPreferencePage should also support this and publish its 
preference string.

This requires:
The preference string can be described easy
The preference store must be listened to as users can change a preference 
string (problematic with the cache)
