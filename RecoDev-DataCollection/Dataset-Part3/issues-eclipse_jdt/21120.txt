GM6
looks like this thing goes and checks each file before puttin itself to the menu
if 1 cu is readonly - the action is not there.
very confusing (how am i supposed to know that that was the reason?)
plus, it's wrong - it should just go and do it for other files

We should use validateEdit support as we do for refactoring. But validateEdit 
should only be called on execution and if we really change the CU. If we can't 
edit the CU we should show an Error dialog saying which CUs couldn't be changed.
