Build id: 200303041402

I have a workspace in which I have created a working set which filters out most
of the Eclipse plugin projects.  I opened
org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.ResourcePropertiesPage.  I right clicked in
the editor and selected "Show in Package Explorer".  I got an error dialog named
"Show In Package Explorer" the message was:

Couldn't reveal the selected element in Package Explorer.  May be the element is
filtered out.

I suggest:

Could not reveal the selected element in the Package Explorer.  It is likely
that the element is filtered out.
