(using 3.0 M1)

I have the a single line statement I want to surround with a template:

    String foo = "bar";

If can only invoke the surround with popup feature with the Ctrl+1 shortcut when
I have selected the whole line (caret charaters illustrate the selection):

    String foo = "bar";
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If I try to invoke the surround with popup when I have selected from the first
non-whitespace character in the line, it does not appear:

    String foo = "bar";
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If I have selected the statement, I would always expect the surround with popup
to appear.

We show all templates that use line selection variable. Otherwise we would show
too much stuff.
