If you select the Format option from the pop up menu in a Java Editor your current selection location
is lost requiring you to search around for it again.

STEPS
1) Open a relatively large .java file
2) Go near the bottom
3) Select format - you are sent back to the top.

I can't reproduce the exact same problem. It's true that the selection gets 
lost, but the cursor is put at the end of the previous selection.
ok, I reproduced it. Didn't realize that it only happens for no selection.
It's fixed from my point of view. There's currently a problem with the 
CodeFormatter which does not calculate mapped positions correctly if multi-line 
comments are involved.

Once this is fixed, the range check for StyledText.setSelection() can be 
removed from SourceViewer.
closing this bug, since the selection validation is done in TextViewer.
