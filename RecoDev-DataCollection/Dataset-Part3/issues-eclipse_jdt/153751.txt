I20060810-1230

For some quick fixes/assists it is very hard for the user to understand why they are not available in some situations. Such quick assists are i.e. 'Convert to enhanced for loop' (Bug 148419), 'Change block to statement' (Bug 149990), 'Remove this qualifier' (Bug 150481), and maybe others (Add serial version id).

The strategy at the moment is not to show this fixes/assists when they can't be applied and leave the user clueless. I can think of several better approaches:

1. Show the fix and when applied do not change the code but show an error with description in the status line.
2. Show the fix in the proposal but with a diffrend color (red/gray/whatever) and a description in the content assist preview.
3. Show the fix and when applied show a warning dialog with explanation what may go wrong.

1 may be too strict, we should allow the user to apply the fix although it may change the semantic of the code.
2 may require new infrastructure, and I'm not sure if we want to go this path
3 is a bit too intrusive

Any opinions?

See also fixed bug 74525.
I agree. 2 sounds good. That would be similar to non-fatal errors in refactorings (will not work 100%, but can do at least parts of the job).
I think we should try to improve these quick assist to be there but still do something.
For example, the for-loop would be converted but the result has errors. If we know that an error will result we could decorate the quick fix icon with a warning and also add something to the hover.

Note that using a different background color would probbaly require new text API.

Did that for Bug 154939. Check out the attached screenshot...

changed 'semantic' to 'semantics', thanks markus.
Looks good!
This bug has been fixed long time ago... But seams like I forgot to set it to fixed.
