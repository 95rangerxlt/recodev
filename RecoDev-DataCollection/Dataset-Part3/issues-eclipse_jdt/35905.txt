inline intern(String) - you get compile errors (missing brackets)

Unit test

Not reproducible in build I20030715.

It was fixed by the patch to bug #24941. Attached is a unit test verifying the
fix.
Dmitry,

thanks for the test case. Are you interesting in fixing another bug ;-)).
Hi Dirk, 

Yes, I'm interested. I'd like to focus on inline method refactoring bugs for a 
start. I consider working on bug #36049 if it's not taken over by somebody yet.
Hi Dmitry,

feel free to do so. In my opinion we should first try to come up with a small 
proposal, explaining the cases you want to fix. I am not convinced yet that we 
should try to handle all cases. I CCed you to bug 36049 so that we can 
continue the discussion there.
