The 'Remove invalid modifiers' quick fix does not appear for enums and
annotations. In the example below, no quick fix is offered. 

abstract enum E1 {
	public BLUE;
}
final @interface Annot {
	public final String value();
}

When I use class or interface instead of enum and annotation, then it works.

quickfix for enum modifiers

Here is a patch to support the quick fix on modifiers for
* enum
* enum constants
* enum constructor
* member enums

Most of the annotation fixes are already available in HEAD.

There are by the way some modifier doc problems. The markers show wrong informations for correct modifiers. Will open additional bug reporrts after looking closer which are wrong.
patch released > 20080411. Thanks Benjamin!
