Martin, can you fix this for RC2. 

You can bathc the undos via a rewrite target. It can be accesses via

IRewriteTarget target= (IRewriteTarget)editor.getAdapter(IRewriteTarget.class);



Not sure when rc2 is targeted, but will look into on weekend.
RC2 is target for March 6th.
Martin, I can do this, it should be trivial.
