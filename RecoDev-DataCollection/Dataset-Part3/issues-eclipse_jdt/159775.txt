When processing Javadoc comments for classes, the Javadoc View formats some tags properly, e.g. displaying the 'author' tag as "Author:" in boldface.  However, the 'version' tag is displayed as "@version" rather than "Version:".

To reproduce:

1. Create any Java class
2. Write a Javadoc comment for the class, containing various tags (I've tried  @author, @see and @version)
3. Activate Javadoc view: the 'author' and 'see' tags are formatted correctly but the 'version' tag is not.

Created attachment 90991
patch to format version tag

Attached is a patch for this request. But there are still some questions open:

* Why having the same mechanism in several places for different scenarios? (Tooltip, Javadocview, Content Assist) ?
* Are there no tests for the JavadocContentAccess2 class? Cannot find any.
This might be merged together. Currently JavadocContentAccess2  is work in progress and might be merged into JavadocContentAccess. This is in flux.
Markus, can you consider this when working on the improved Javadoc support.
Fixed in HEAD.
