I set the value in
Preferences/ Java/ Code Formator/ Style:
Number of spaces representing a tab to 8.

But the view shows a maximum of 4 spaces per tab. 
Even after restarting eclipse, the value in the settings is still 8, but tabs
are shown with a maximum of 4 spaces.

(using eclipse-3.0.0M6-linux-gtk)

I installed eclipse-3.0.0M8-linux-gtk with it's approved Coding-Style settings
and welcome happily the idea of storing the settings to a xml-file.

And I found the solution: The predefined font isn't equal-width, thus displaying
8 spaces as compact as 'publ' in 'public class foo', which looks as if it is
displaying 4 spaces.
