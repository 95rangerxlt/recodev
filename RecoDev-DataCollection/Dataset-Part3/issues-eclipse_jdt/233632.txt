In Javadoc hovers and the Javadoc view, we should also turn the types in an element header (method arguments, field type, type arguments, ...) into links. We once tried that, but all the blue and underlines looked too noisy.

The headers should look like today, but types should get underlines (and maybe change their color) when the user hovers over them.
