3.2 M5 testing

A) default output folder should be on source page

Perhaps I don't understand the reasoning behind - but I don't see why the "Default output folder" property at the bottom of the "New Java Project" wizard is of such importance that it should always be displayed.

IMO, it should be moved onto the 'Source' tab page, where also per-source folder output locations may be configured. It has nothing to do with the other tabs (Project deps, export...).

B) Output location specification

Specific output folder should be configurable by double-clicking the entry under the source folder in the project layout area, not only by using the hyperlink below. Note that this works as expected from the project's properties dialog, but not the wizard.

C) .settings can be used as source location

I agree that we don't have to over-protect the user... perhaps a warning would help?

A) The reason for the output folder being below all tabs was as you can have a conflic of the classfolder with the output folder. But now with folder specific outputfolder this is a problem again.
But yes, we could add the outputfolder to the source page. Not sure if that makes anything easier to understand.

B) Agreed

C) worse is to put the output folder on settings. that will clean out everything!
I guess we should warn from using .settings. Maybe ward wor all folder starting with dot. 'This folder is likely containing configuration files'
I opt to warn from all .folders. We currently have project settings, refactoring history information and (soon) deprecation information

Warn if .something folder is output folder.
