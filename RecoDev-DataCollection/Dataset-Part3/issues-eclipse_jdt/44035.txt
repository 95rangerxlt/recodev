This is for build I20030930. The Java code formatter options are set to Format
java code snippets.

Taking the following comment:

/**
 * The following is a Java snipet.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  while ((size = availableSize(stream, size)) > 0) {
 *      System.out.println("available");
 * }
 * </pre>
 */
    public void test() {        
    }

And trying to format it here is what we got:
    /**
      * The following is a Java snipet.
      * 
      * <pre>
      *  while ((size = availableSize(stream, size)) > 0) {
      *      System.out.println("available");
}
      * </pre>
      */
    public void test() {

    }

Tobias, the problem happens with default preferences when you select parts of a
comment: in comment 0 test case select all lines including <pre> and </pre>.

Adapted summary to contain the word "parts of". When the whole comment or file
is formatted it works.

Fix for wrong position handling
Patch rejected. It is still not working.

Moving back to inbox for reassignment.
snippet formatting does not work at all in N20031116 + export 20031118:
everything is put on a single line.
see bug 47166 for a further description of comment 5. will probably be fixed
together.

I just noticed compressing of whitespace in <pre> elements of JavaDoc. I used 3.4RC3.
Please don't open old bugs but file a new one instead.
Daniel, in most other projects it would be very likely that a new bug would have been marked as duplicate. I really don't want to learn about all the subtle differences in Bugzilla handling. I told you of a problem in your product. I suggest that you act accordingly or just don't do it. It's up to you...
Eike, this (i.e. the test case reported in comment 0) works for me. If you see something not working then please file a new bug report with steps to reproduce.

Note that per default we format code inside <pre> tags and hence compressing whitespace is expected.
Say, this is a word ;-)
I must have missed this preference switch.
Now I'm happy again. Thank you.
