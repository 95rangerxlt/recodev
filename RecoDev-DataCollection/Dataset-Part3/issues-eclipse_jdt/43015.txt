build I20030910

- open Java compiler prefs
- change the compliance prefs to the new ones recommended by releng:
Compiler compliance level:  1.4 
Generated .class files compatibility:  1.2 
Source compatibility:  1.3 
Report 'assert' as identifier:  Warning 

- check "Use default compliance settings"
- it shows 1.4 all compatibility entries, and Error for the 'assert' check, 
but these are disabled since they can't be changed (correct)
- uncheck "Use default compliance settings"
- the fields become editable again, but the manually entered values are lost

It should remember the manually entered values, and restore them when not 
using the defaults.
