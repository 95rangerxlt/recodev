1. Create a new java project 'P01' with separate src folder
2. Expand 'P01'
3. Ctrl-A
Is: P01, src, and the JRE is selected, correct
4. Collapse 'P01'
5. Expand 'P01'
Is: only P01, is selected, maybe correct
6. Collapse 'P01'
7. Ctrl-A
8. Expand 'P01'
Is: P01, src, and the JRE is selected

That's strange because:
a) I did not expect that Ctrl-A in step 7 does select non visible elements
b) It's different from what I see after step 5

It looks like once you expanded a node that susequent 'Select All' invocations do select the node and its children, no matter if the node is expanded or collapsed (i.e. expand the jre container once).
