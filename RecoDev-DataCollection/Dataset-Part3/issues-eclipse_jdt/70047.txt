Creating and updating serialVersionUID with the command line tool is tedious 
and error prone.  A source method with did this within eclipse would be very 
convenient.

A possible interface is a menu item, something like "Update Serial Version", on 
the source menu, which is active for classes that implement 
java.io.Serializable.

See also bug 69942, which asks for a compiler warning.

I believe UI support for it is in as well.
Moving to UI.
There is now a quick fix for this. If missing serial version id is turned on
there is a quick fix to generate one.
