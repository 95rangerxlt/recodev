Fair request.
I checked some of the other refactoring wizards and none of them "repeat" the element they modify. I looked at rename, extract local, inline. If we add the element to be modified then we should do it consequently for all refactorings. 
For rename, change method signature, etc. the selected element's name is the initial name, so the element is at least initially visible. Move also shows the element.

Inline local variable already shows the name of the local variable.

Fixed in HEAD for inline method and for inline constant as well.
