When writing a Javadoc comment (both on class, method and attribute), the text
is inserted backwards (when inserting a character, the cursor is moved one
position to the left, i.e. to the left of the inserted character). This
behaviour is reproducible on any .java file.

I'm using the "200211230010" nightly build.

Actually, the same goes for ordinary comments (/* */).
This bug seems to have disappeared in I200212101456.
