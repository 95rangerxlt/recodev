It should be nice if we can setup "Add JavaDoc comment" feature to be able to 
add author parameter (with a default value), version (with a default value),
etc..... so selecting "Add JavaDoc comment", the comment is added with the 
default info we setup.

This would make sense for the type comment and Martin you have already added 
support for this, correct?
'Add Javadoc comment' is now also supported on types.
The 'typecomment' template is insert (which can contain '@author')
We can't add the version as the java plugin know nothing about team plugins
