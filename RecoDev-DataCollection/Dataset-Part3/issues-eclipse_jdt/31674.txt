Some time between 20030122 and M5 the package explorer behavior changed to 
where it also displays closed projects. (Personally, I do not like this because 
the reason why I close projects is because I do not want to work on them for a 
while...).
There should be a package explorer filter option to bring back the old behavior 
of hiding closed projects. There is an existing filter choice of hiding "non-
shared projects" but that is not the same.

A closed project filter got released to HEAD and will be in the next 
integration build > I20030212.
