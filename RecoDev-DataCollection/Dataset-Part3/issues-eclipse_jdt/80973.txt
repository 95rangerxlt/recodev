When using the "Extract Interface" refactoring method, only the first method
comment is copied to the interface. For example, if "Extract Interface" is used
on the following class, only the TODO comment will be copied to the interface.

========================
public class Bla {
  // TODO implement
  /**
   * @return zero
   */
  public int bla() {
    return 0;
  }
}
========================

The result will look like:

========================
public interface IBla {
  // TODO implement
  public int bla();
}
========================

The cause of this is in JavaElementCommentFinder. It only copies the first
comment token it finds.

suggested fix

I have modified JavaElementCommentFinder#getCommentRange() so it will return a
range of all of the method comments and not just the first.
Tobias, wouldn't using AST rewrite fix the problem ?
It would be good anyway to convert it to ASTRewrites. That way we could also 
adapt the method comments of the refactored type to the see_to_overridden 
template or an @inheritdoc javadoc tag.
In my view, the above TODO tag is unrelated to method bla, since it already 
contains a javadoc comment, which would be copied using ASTRewrites. 
ASTRewrite gives no direct access to this comment. We would have to retrieve 
it from the comment list of the compilation unit node. TODO tags for methods 
should be place into the body or into the javadoc comment anyway.
Converted to ast rewrite
