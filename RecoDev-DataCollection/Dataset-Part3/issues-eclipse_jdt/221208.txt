Build ID: M20071023-1652

Steps To Reproduce:
1. open JAR Export wizard
2. go to the page JAR Manifest Specifications
3. choose Generate the manifest file
4. check Save the manifest in the workspace
5. let's have there a default value from previous
6. erase that value -> Finish disables (that's right)
7. uncheck Save the manifest in the workspace option
8. the button Finish is still disabled, although it should be enabled yet.


More information:
Because I have previously saved manifest, I have got there a default value, but when I uncheck it, I can't click on the Finish button. Finally it's also preventing me from erasing the default value.

I can't reproduce this. Is there an error message in the title bar?
No message. That button just won't enable.

I can:
step 1.5: select to save the description of the jar in the workspace
step 4.5: check reuse and save the manifest in the workspace

Petr, workaround for you: 
1. Check 'Save manifest in workspace'
2. Uncheck 'Reuse and save the manifset'
3. Unckeck 'Save manifest in workspace'

What does this option anyway?!

One video worth thousands of words:

I can't uncheck "Reuse and save the manifset". I don't know why. Maybe I'm just missing something. I hope this video will help you.

Ahh, I see, you need to check 'Save the description of this JAR in the workspace' on the 'JAR Packaging Options' Page in order to make the 'Reuse and save' option enabled. Obvious, isn't it;-)

Hint that I have a fix and it's trivial. But I want to try to improve this UI.

fix

If the option is checked then the saved manifest file will be used when the jar file is generated through the jardesc file. I hope that this fix makes it a little bit clearer, at least a connection is made between the option and the jar desc file.

Thanks for the video btw, but doesn't the rotating mouse cursors cause sea-sickness;-)

No :) At least one knows every time, where the cursor is at the moment. They also exist in "less rotating" version, but I like these ones :)

btw thx for fix ;)
