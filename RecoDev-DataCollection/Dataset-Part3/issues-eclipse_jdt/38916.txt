Creation of several of new, empty packages within a hierarchy at the same time
is not possible, without adding to the base package.  

For example:
create org.benow.media
then org.benow.media.input
and the newly created 'org.benow.media' is renamed to 'org.benow.media.input'

Perhaps the logic could be explained.  I can see why an empty parent package
would seem somewhat useless afa the compiler is concerned, but for sketching out
a project, it may be useful to sketch out the package hierarchy before designing
Interfaces (and Classes).  Its not a big bug, for sure, but it may interrupt the
programming 'flow'.

Thanks muchly, and keep up the great work.

An empty package is not deleted or renamed, its just not shown in the package 
explorer.

From the package explorer's drop down menu, select "Filters"
Uncheck the option "Emtpy parent packages" to have all packages displayed.

Note that this won't change much if you use hierarchical layout.

Propose to close PR.


Yep, that solved my problem... ok to close for me.
