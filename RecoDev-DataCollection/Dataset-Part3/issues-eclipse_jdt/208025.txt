3.4

When a container is specified for running tests (i.e. package or source folder), the resource mapping for the launch configuration is incorrectly mapped to the project (instead of the package or source folder).

The problem appears to be in JUnitMigrationDelegate. Will attach patch.

Patch updates the "resource mapping". It appears that the container and type attributes are filled with empty strings rather than "null", so the existing code was not properly detecting when a container was specified.
Would be nice for M4
