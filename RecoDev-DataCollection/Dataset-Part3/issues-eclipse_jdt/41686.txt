When there is declaration like "public int a, b, c;" on trying to delete some 
of field through  “Package Explorer”or  JDT directly (“a” for example) code 
will be corrupted and looks like "b, c;".

this works fine in the 3.0 stream
whis build you see it on? 2.1, i gather from the 'version' field
will add a test to make sure we don't see the problem again
fixed - tests are in place
Could this mean that bug 15305 is also fixed?
no, the ui does not use IField:delete anymore
we use the ASTRewriter to delete fields, methods etc
