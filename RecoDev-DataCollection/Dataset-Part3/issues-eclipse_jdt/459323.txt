Patch contains some improvements for o.e.jdt.ui.examples.projects:
    
    * Set "strictly compatible JRE" pref to warning (so it works out of the box for everyone)
    * Bump BREE to 1.5 (this is highest BREE used by any eclipse.jdt.ui bundle)
    * Drop useless non-javadoc comments
    * Avoid use of nested jar (prevents workspace "dirt" at build time)

Please see bug 419524 comment 10:
"
I should note, despite some of my mis-statements from years ago, there's nothing about "nested jars", per se, that causes dirty working trees.
"

Is there any "dirt" produced by the jdt.ui.examples?

Yes, instead of an error you get a warning that you later ignore, and then cause a build breakage by introducing compile errors into the build. See e.g. bug 458005 comment 4.

Steps to reproduce the dirt:
git clone git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git
cd eclipse.jdt.ui
mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles
mvn clean -Pbuild-individual-bundles
git status

Hi Dani,

I was looking at this bug again and I stumbled across bug 278968, where this project was removed from the build around the Eclipse 3.6 timeframe.

Did this regress when the project was converted to tycho build?

If so, should we just remove it from the build again? (Simple edit to the pom.xml)

Good catch Mat!

Removed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=9cde5051fbfae3c3fb00fbe0717c2ffd414b8d99
