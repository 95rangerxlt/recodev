Andrew, 

this is now user customizable (Preferenes->Workbench->Keys), but the sort 
members action is missing its action defintion. We will fix this, but will not 
preassign a short cut.



Martin, please add a action definition for the sort members action.
fixed > 20030219

also added missing action definitions for 'Generate Getter/Setter', 'Generate 
delegate methods' and 'Add Javadoc comment'
