Build ID: 3.4M4

Steps To Reproduce:
Perform a CVS commit of a very large file that will take several minutes to update. 

Then go to a java editor and do "organize imports." Ctrl-shift-o. A dialog will open saying it is waiting for the workspace to be free. 

There should be no need to write to the workspace to organize imports. This operation should be allowed to proceed while CVS commits are happening.

We can try this out for M6. The problem is that we don't know what rules the API require that we need (search engine, AST)
