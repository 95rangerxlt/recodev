Using 1210, with ALL smart settings disabled.
It is not possible to do a copy/paster or a delete in block comments at some
locations.
1) Create a class with this contents.
/*
 * SELECT THIS LINE
 */
public class A {

}
2) Select the whole line containing SELECT THIS LINE.
3) Do Ctrl + C (copy)
4) Go at the beginning of the next line.
5) Paste.
I end up with:
/*
 * SELECT THIS LINE
 * SELECT THIS LINE
 * */
instead of:
/*
 * SELECT THIS LINE
 * SELECT THIS LINE
 */
This is the same bug for pasting anywhere in the comment.

Now the deletion problem.

1) Take this source:
/*
 * 
 * 
 * /
public class A {

}
2) Put the cursor on the space between the last '*' and '/'.
3) Press delete.
You end up with:
/*
 * 
 * /
instead of:
/*
 *
 *
 */
So you can never close this block comment.

Version 2 of the same problem:
/*
 * TEXT
 * |<cursor>
 */ 
Try to delete the space where the cursor is. It won't simply erase the space.

I like when a text editor stays a text editor. If I disable all smart behaviors,
I like them to stay disabled.

This should be fixed for M4. It is a serious problem with the java editor usability.
