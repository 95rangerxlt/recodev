Per bug 418966 I'd like to start deploying new Gerrit permission sets to all JDT repos as described in bug 418966 comment 14. This would affect all the repos listed below.

eclipse.jdt.core.binaries.git
eclipse.jdt.core.git
eclipse.jdt.debug.git
eclipse.jdt.git
eclipse.jdt.ui.git

Dani, Michael, Markus, Jay,

Can you guys +1 this request if the plan is alright with you?
+1. Sounds reasonable and was tested by platform.ui and I assume this does not affect the setting from bug 407013.

NOTE: Please make the changes very early your time and not in the evening in cease it fails and blocks users in Europe from working. In that case I would have to wake up the webmaster ;-).

Sounds good. I will wait till first thing in the morning tomorrow to deploy these assuming all the projects give their +1.
As I understood, these changes only affect Gerrit, and not the main git repo (to which we still have direct access and which is still protected with the hooks.allow* config flags).

+1 from me.
+1 from me.
Done. I changed the permissions on the 5 repos listed in comment 0.

Jay, I didn't get a +1 from you but I suspect you're ok with the change. Let me know if I'm wrong and I can revert :)

Sorry about it. I have no problem with the changes.
