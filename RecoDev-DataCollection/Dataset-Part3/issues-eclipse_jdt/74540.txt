The implementation of the contains method on BatchSimilarSchedulingRule does not
obey the rules set out in the API javadoc for that method. In particular, all
rules must contain themselves (a.contains(a) must be true). Invalid scheduling
rule implementations can break assumptions made in the locking implementation
and cause serious bugs (see bug 73946 for an example). To avoid this, I will be
adding assert statements to enforce the API rules for scheduling rules. The
contains method on this rule will need to be fixed.

Fixed in HEAD.
