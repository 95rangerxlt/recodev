Build: 20020409

1. Make a project, ProjA.
2. Change ProjA's .classpath file to read-only.
3. Open the Java Build path properties on ProjA, and change the output directory
to be bin.
4. Hit ok, the save fails with an error.
5. Close the properties dialog.
6. Open the properties on ProjA again.
7. The the output path is still bin. <- bug

Note:  The .classpath file does not change (as expected)

We should re-read the file contents if unable to write over it.
Changed the implementation to perform file saving before applying the classpath 
change. If unable to write, then the change is a noop.

Fixed
*** Bug 6165 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
Backporting this fix to 1.0 stream. Fix for it is slightly different for 
reducing the amount of touched code. We simply restore old classpath, build 
order and classpath markers if exception is thrown while writing classpath file.

Released in version 'v_144'.
Actually, also need to protect the SetOutputLocationOperation as well.
Fix released into v_144a
