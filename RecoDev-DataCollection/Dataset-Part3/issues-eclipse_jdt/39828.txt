java files under source control (clearcase) and read-only when not checked
out can be copied, but not pasted. That makes no sense since the next step
is for the rename dialog to popup (which is what happens when the file is
not read-only). Even paste into a different package fails with the same
error, which makes even less sense. It should be ok for the source of the copy
operation to be read-only.

Got fixed for upcoming M2 integration build.
