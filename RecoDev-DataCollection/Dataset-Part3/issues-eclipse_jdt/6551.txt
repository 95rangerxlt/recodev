Import assists adds an import entry that is not used in the following
scenario:

- Create a new 
Java Project.
- Add org.eclipse.core.runtime/runtime.jar to the classpath.
- Verify that 
rt.jar is on the classpath.
- Add class "ImportAssistBug" to the default package:
	public 
class ImportAssistBug {
		void foo() {
			int i = IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN;
		}
	}
- 
Type Ctrl+Shift+O
- Notice that the following unused import is added:
	import 
org.omg.CORBA.UNKNOWN;

This scenario could be fixed by checking the prefix of the inserted import.
Marco, is this on the 1.0 eclipse?
The bug was fixed for 2.0, and I couldn't reproduce it.
We (WSDD team) develop on Eclipse 1.0, so I found the bug in 1.0. I could not find a similar bug in 
Bugzilla. Good to know that the bug is fixed in 2.0.
fixed in 2.0
