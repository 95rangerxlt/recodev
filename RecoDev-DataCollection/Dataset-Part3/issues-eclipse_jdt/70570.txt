R3.0

The state of the Java > JUnit > "Show Junit results view only if errors or
failures occur" has no effect at all i.e. the view opens whether this preference
is checked or not (minor detail: if JUnit is a fast view then the pref seems to
work).

While this is not yet a major bug it unfortunately also affects whether the
JUnit view's title (progress) gets updated: there's a missing ! and hence it
does not update the title when I uncheck this preference.

The only time when the icon update should not be done is when the JUnit view
hasn't been created yet.

ERich, can you please comment on this ?
Discussed with Dani and Markus. The confusion is that the progress reporting 
in the view icon is coupled with the "show on error only" preference. 
This got fixed and the progress reporting in the view icon is now independent 
of the preference and only done when the view is NOT visible (i.e., shows up 
when the view is a fast view).

The rational for ignoring the preference when the view isn't visible yet is 
that by default we would like to have the show on error behaviour only, but 
out of the box this might be too confusing to now show the view at all.
So there is no action planned to fix this one.
