Note that so far I've not been able to reproduce it again. This is however what I think I did to trigger the NPE:

1. "Save Actions" enabled (code formatting, organize imports + some additional actions)
2. I was trying to break a long Java manifest string into 2 small pieces by adding a concatenation operator ('+') (thus "foo bar" -> "foo " + "bar").
3. I saved the file, the formatter then probably tried to reformat the code because the new strings could now fit on 2 different lines to enforce the default maximum line width (80).
4. got the NPE (cf attached stack trace)

Some undo change in the history was not correctly initialized. Difficult to reproduce.

Fixed in UndoTextFileChange to tolerate that 'dispose' can be called.
