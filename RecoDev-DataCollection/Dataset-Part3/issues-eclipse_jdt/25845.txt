From Dejan:
There is a work item on the ability to manually attach source to classpath
entries managed by classpath container. We discussed it and we have
workable options but we would like if we can have it by M3 because we want
to start self-hosting using classpath containers ourselves.

The current way to add a source attachment to a container is to open the 
container's configuration page which should offer a source attachment dialog on 
its entries (Java Build Path -> libraries -> edit).
The planed extension point is that we can also offer a solution for the 'Attach 
Source' button in a classfile editor, and to have something in the JAR's 
property page. Planed for M4.

Note that PDE will have its own 'SourceAttachmentDialog' that uses 
the 'internal' SourceAttachmentBlock class for M3. This solution seems to work 
for us, particularly because we are using SourceAttachmentBlock for choosing 
the path and the root path but not for executing the dialog. In our case, we 
simply preserve the association of the library path with the source attachment 
paths, so that when our classpath container computes the entires, it can 
consult these preserved states if automatic source attachment computation 
fails. 

The rational is that PDE should be able to automatically compute source 
attachments in the majority of cases. In the very small number of cases (for 
example, with Xerces or Lucene), user intervention is required. We will 
preserve the new associations in the user state location but these associations 
will be automatically discarded when the eclipse home changes i.e. when 
pointing at a new driver. 
JavaCore now offers new API so that containers can be asked to update from the 
outside:

ClasspathContainerInitializer.requestClasspathContainerUpdate
ClasspathContainerInitializer.canUpdateClasspathContainer

ClasspthContainer contributers can override these methods. Dejan and Darin, can 
you add the support for your containers? I'll add the UI support for M5.

Yes, I am working on this in java debug - tracking with bug 29651.
Added support in JDT-UI for the ClasspathContainerInitializer methods.
(to allow source attachement configuration on entries from containers)

New class 'SourceAttachmentDialog' is candidate to become an API class. Please 
use it instead of SourceAttachmentBlock. It's still in the internal packages as 
it currently extends StatusDialog which we want to promote to the Desktop but I 
would be glad if you could tell me if it fullfills your needs.
