Verifying performance results for all 3.6M4 scenarios, it appears that results for NonInitialTypingTest#testTypeAMethod() test are completely unreliable (at least on Linux test machines).

It seems that something should be done to stabilize this test or remove it from the benchmark.

Time permitting.
I see also the same unreliability for TextNonInitialTypingTest#testTypeAMethod() test...
>(at least on Linux test machines).
Yes, we know - it's like that for years that's why we've taken it out of the fingerprint.

I have increased the runs to make it a bit more stable but I don't want to remove it completely.

Fixed in HEAD and perf_35x.
