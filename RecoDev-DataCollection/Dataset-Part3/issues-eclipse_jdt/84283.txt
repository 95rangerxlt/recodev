The new class wizard will not generate method stubs for indirectly inherited
abstract methods, only for those directly inherited. A simple test case is to
create a new class that implements
org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ITreeContentProvider. The resulting code has only the
following methods:

	public Object[] getChildren(Object parentElement) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return null;
	}

	public Object getParent(Object element) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return null;
	}

	public boolean hasChildren(Object element) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return false;
	}
