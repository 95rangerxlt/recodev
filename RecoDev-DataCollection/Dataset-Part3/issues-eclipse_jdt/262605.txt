build I20090126-1300

With the fix for bug 260717 ANONYMOUS_CLASS_DECLARATION proposals can have a TYPE_REF proposal as required proposals when a constructor is completed and the type is not imported

package missing;
public class MissingType {
  public MissingType(int i) {}
}

package test;
public class Test{
  void foo() {
    new MissingType(| // do ctrl+space at |
  }
}

In this case a METHOD_REF and ANONYMOUS_CLASS_DECLARATION with a TYPE_REF as required proposal can be proposed but JDTText does not support that for ANONYMOUS_CLASS_DECLARATION. So only the METHOD_REF are displayed to the user.

JDTText should add the support for ANONYMOUS_CLASS_DECLARATION.
