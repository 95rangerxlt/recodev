Eclipse Platform Version 3.1.0 Build id: 200411300010

If you export a class file whose java file is not yet saved, it will prompt you
to save the java file right before exporting. However, the exported class file
is not the recompiled version after saving the java file, but instead the older
version.

This problem also appears in 3.1 Stream Stable Build M3.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Modify a java file without saving
2. Choose to Export a class file, e.g. by JAR Export
3. Press Finish button and a window titled "Save Modified Resources" prompted
you to save the java file before continuing.

Expected Results:  
exported class file is the recompiled version after saving the java file.

Actual Results:  
exported class file is the version before saving the java file.

Move to PDE/UI.
I'm not sure who provides the JAR export, but it's not PDE.  perhaps JDT/UI.
Fixed for M4.
