build I20021217

- new workspace
- new Java project
- new class Test
- place cursor at the start of the blank line in the body of the class
- type: main<Ctrl+Space> and select the main method template
- it is inserted at the start of the blank line
- select the whole method and cut it
- paste it back in the same place
- it is now indented

Need to determine whether auto-formatting makes sense for all templates, or 
just certain kinds like this one.

i believe this has been fixed for some time.
