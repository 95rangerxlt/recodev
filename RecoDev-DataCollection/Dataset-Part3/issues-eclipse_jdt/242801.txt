1. Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables
2. Click 'New...'
3. The 'File...' and 'Folder...' buttons seem to be placed in an odd spot. One might even think the 'File...' button should match the first text entry and the 'Folder...' the second instead of having them both "down by one".

Please see bug 20879 for a similar problem in Platform/UI's code. I think the two buttons should be on the same line as the 'Path:' text field or on their own line.

Whoops, that should be bug 204879.
Fixed in HEAD.
