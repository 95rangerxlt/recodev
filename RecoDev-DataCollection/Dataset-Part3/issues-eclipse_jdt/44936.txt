Override indicators appear to be broken in 3.0M4.

I can (for example) open up one of my classes which extends junit's TestCase,
hit Ctrl-O for the fast outline view, or look at the normal outline view, and
Eclipse 2.1.1 is shows me 3 overrides (toString(), setUp(), tearDown()), while
3.0M4 shows me only toString() as an override, for some reason.

I am unable to put a pattern to this. It just seems to miss some of them...
