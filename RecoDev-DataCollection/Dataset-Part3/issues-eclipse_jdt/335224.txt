The New JUnit Test Case wizard doesn't store method stub selection state when you click Finish on the first page. Reason is that NewTestCaseWizardPageOne#saveWidgetValues() is only called on setVisible(false).

Raksha, please check whether that was already broken in older releases
If it worked before, find out what change in the platform caused this.
If it was already broken in the beginning, fix it so that the values are stored no matter how the dialog is closed (even when the user pressed Escape).
Broken since 3.2.
Fixed with the attached patch.

Patch

Patch against HEAD.
The code changes in MethodStubsSelectionButtonGroup were not good. When the user switches between JUnit 3 and 4, we have to uncheck the buttons that get disabled, and we must not create the respective method stubs.

Fixed with http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/commit/?id=4d1ccf1451cda4f146b93c7bcc05850ab2b01e8a
