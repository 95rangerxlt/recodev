'Add Javadoc Comment' cannot currently be used to create Javadoc comments for 
fields.

While arguably it cannot do any more than add an empty /*...*/ block above the 
field, and thus is of limited use, it should NOT do what it currently does, 
which is create a new class comment (above the existing one, if there is one).

The Add Javadoc Comment option should probably be made context-sensitive, so 
that it can only be used to add a class comment when the cursor is on the first 
line of the class (... class Foo ...) (and perhaps above that, if it is the 
first class in the file).  It just doesn't make sense to be able to create a 
class comment from below the first method/field of the class.

Move to JDT/UI, because AddJavaDoc is a jdt.ui feature.
It is very unlikely that this gets fixed for 2.0. We should doc it in the readme
agreed readme & defer
Got addressed for 2.1
