My custom perspective has a Packages pane, Hierarchy pane and a code editor 
pane. My packages pane is really a pane with a Packages Tab and a Projects Tab.

(1) I select one of my packages.
(2) I choose Open in Types Hierarchy.
(3) E opens by package in the Types Hierarchy but Selects the class Object!
(4) This causes the Package pane to select the java.lang package!
(5) I have "lost" my context and the UI looks "funny": I have the beautiful 
hierarchy view of my classes in my package but, Object is selected (which is 
not in my package obviously) and java.lang is selected.

Suggestion:
(a) Do NOT select any classes in the just opened package.
(b) If you MUST select a class, select one in the package. Please.

Thank you very much.

This is indeed distracting. Martin I suggest that we don't select any type.

Now, no type is selected when the hierarchy is opened on a project or package.
