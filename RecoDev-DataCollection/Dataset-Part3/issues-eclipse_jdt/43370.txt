The panel for Code Generation allows you to see the "Pattern" for the various
generation situations.  This background is gray, however, it should be the same
color as the Java Editor background, or else the color-coded syntax may not
appear correctly.

When editing this pattern, the same problem happens except it assumes a white
background.

moving to Dani, as discussed
I notice that in M4, the editing portion has been fixed, but the actual
preferences panel has not yet been changed.
Fixed all JDT UI Java source previewers.
