If you select a .java file with multiple classes in it, and select 'References'-
>'Workspace' from the context menu in the Packages view, you will be presented 
with a dialog to select which class you mean.

The title of the dialog is 'Show in Type Hierarchy' and the first line of text 
says '&Select the type to be shown in Type Hierarchy view'.

It looks like somebody snarfed the type hierarchy selection dialog without 
updating the labels to be more appropriate for searching.
