TypeRenameParticipant still uses 'isTest' property to check enablement in the plugin.xml. To avoid loading of the JUnit plug-in, it should use the same tests as JUnitLaunchShortcut (only loads jdt.launching).

3.2.1 candidate
Not for 3.2.1. There are other contributions that usually cause loading of the JUnit plug-in earlier than the rename participant (e.g. JUnitQuickFixProcessor, which is loaded for every problem shown in a Java editor).
Fixed in HEAD.
