Build F2

The dialog that appears when you add a new variable to a project's build path 
has a tree view representing the file system.

The tree displays a strictly alphabetical listing of files in the folder 
pointed at by the selected variable.

At least on Windows, it's conventional to sort folders before files. This tree 
should follow that convention.
