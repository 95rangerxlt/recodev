Looking at JSR 335 draft spec 0.5.1 section G I see the following tasks
regarding inheritance/overriding involving default methods:

Report new/modified errors:

9.4.1:
  "It is a compile-time error if an interface I inherits a default method
   whose signature is override-equivalent with another method inherited by I.
   This is the case whether the other method is abstract or has a default."

9.4.3:
  "It is a compile-time error if an interface method with a default body is 
   override-equivalent with a public instance method of the class Object, ..."

8.4.8.4 (modified):
  "It is a compile-time error if a class C inherits a non-abstract method
   whose signature is override-equivalent with another method inherited by C."


In the same context the computation of inherited methods must be checked
against changes in 9.4.1 and 8.4.8.

Also, which method to consider as overriding must be updated in accordance
with the same paragraphs.

Finally, method lookup must be updated according to changes in 15.12.1 ff.

This tasks may require further break down into smaller tasks as we go.

With all sub-tasks resolved, I declare this bug resolved wrt the 0.6.2 spec draft.
