Created attachment 59528
patch on org.eclipse.jdt
Created attachment 59531
new images
Instructions:

1. Apply the patch.
2. Unzip the images in the plugin (images folder should be at the root of the
plugin).
3. Delete the intro/css/graphics folder.

This updates the images, places them in the new recommended location, made a few changes for consistency with other welcome contributions in the SDK, and removed some unused styles.
4. Update build.properties to include new images folder.
