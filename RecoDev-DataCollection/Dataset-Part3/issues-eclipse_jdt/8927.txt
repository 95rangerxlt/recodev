It would be efficient to be able to manually reorganize the location of fields 
and methods within the source with drag and drop in the Outline view. This 
would be much easier than cut and paste whole blocks of text in the editor.

Those of us that have migrated from VAJ have all the methods in alphabetical 
order. If we are going to be able to view the whole source, it would be nice to 
be able to rearrange it easily. Like the Organize Imports command, a new 
command like Organize Methods could be added to automagically organize 
constructors, getters/setters, public/package/protected/private methods, etc.

1. dnd feature request has been filed before as bug#6305

2. you can use cut/copy/paste actions in viewers (which will allow you to 
do more reorganization in a structured way)

3. Organize Members is a new feature request

Organize members would be a useful feature, but it currently has lower 
priority. Defer for now.
defer for after 2.0
*** Bug 3605 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***
