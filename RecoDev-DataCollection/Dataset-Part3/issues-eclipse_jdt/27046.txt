I have several entries under package explorer.  When I try to update the whole
collection, the selection reverts to the one under the mouse.

To reproduce:

Collapse all packages with collapse button.  Select top package.  <shift> select
last package to highlight the whole list.  Right click to get to team->update,
while mouse is over one of the packages.  The highlight of all entries
disappears and only the one the mouse is over stays highlighted.

Broken in M3, worked in M2

Jennifer, can you please check if this was introduced by the new hierarchical 
view.
This appears to be fixed in I20021119.
I've also been unable to reproduce on I20021119 so I'll mark as fixed.
JRT.
