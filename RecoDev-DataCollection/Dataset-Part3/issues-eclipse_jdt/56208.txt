A lot of the shortcuts do not work in Linux, neither they are present on the
Menus. Some of these (from Source Menu) are:

CTRL+SHIFT+/
CTRL+SHIFT+\
CTRL+SHIFT+C
CTRL+SHIFT+F
CTRL+I
etc... etc...

Using 3.0 M7 - GTK.

Also CTRL-X C V do not work for cut copy paste.

Also see bug 45532 (similar bug for CDT)

Thanks

Daniel, have you heard about this. Please note that the bug got reported 
against M7.
most shift A-F key sequences did not work under linux for M7. Can't remember the
bug number right now
