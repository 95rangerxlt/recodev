In the Java Browsing perspective, invoking a JUnit test case no longer brings 
the JUnit view to the top when it is not selected. This used to be the case. 
It seems that in general it is the case that an operation whose results goes 
into a view always brings that view forward, for example, a search.

We have changed the default to only show the JUnit view when there are errors. 
You can change this behaviour in Preferences>Java>JUnit.
