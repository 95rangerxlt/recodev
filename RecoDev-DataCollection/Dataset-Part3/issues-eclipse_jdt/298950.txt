Thanks, I should have opened the bug for Orbit. Next time I'll remember ;-)


The change in JDT/UI will be to update org.junit4 to require and re-export 4.8.1.
The bundles are in Orbit and are available in the latest build from the committers section.

I think that I got the format, abouts, etc correct but a second set of eyes looking at it would be great.

Thanks.
Fixed in HEAD (updated org.junit4)
