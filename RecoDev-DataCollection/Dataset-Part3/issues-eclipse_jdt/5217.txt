Known limitation for now. 
From Daniel Megert:

this bug priority 4 but I consider it a major bug because the following things 
in Eclipse do not work due to that bug:

1) Working Sets which contain single resources do not work for Java search 
(they do for text search)
2) The Main Class for a JAR export cannot be set anymore because the MainType 
dialog is empty due to the bad search scope

Dani

Fixed by finding the package fragment root of the java element.
