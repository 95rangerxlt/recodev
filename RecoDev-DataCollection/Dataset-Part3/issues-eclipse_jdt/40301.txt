It would be good if the first line of the Javadoc view contains a full signature
of the current element: fully qualified tyoe name, method signature, thrown
exception ect.

This is additional information that is not fully available in the Javadoc. It is
contained in the hover, so to get it I would have to use the hover again.

The information is in the title and if you hover over the title you get the
fully qualified information.

Is this not enough?
I would prefer to have it in the view. You don't want to move the mouse to see
the hover. For accessibility reasons I guess it would be better to not only have
in the hover.
Note that the current short form of the title ('append') is really not enough. I
want to see enclosing class, parameters, thrown exceptions, return type... And
all fully-qualified.


Discussed with Kai. Agrees with me that info in title is enough. I improved the
title to contain the qualified element e.g. org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaUI
