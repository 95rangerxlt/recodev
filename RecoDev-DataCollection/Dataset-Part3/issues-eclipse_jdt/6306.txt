fixed delete for package viewer and outliner
this is doable without further platform UI support our views have to register 
their actions "global action handlers"

cannot access IActionBars from JavaOutlinePage
another thing is: what do we do when the shortcuts are pressed in the packages 
view? should Ctrl+C always be equal to 'Copy'? guess so.

yes, ctrl-C should always refer to copy.

Can't you get to the action bars via the IPageSite. From the build notes:

The interface IPageBookViewPage has been introduced as an extension of IPage. 
It defines the methods init(IPageSite) and getSite(). The method init
(IPageSite) is called before createControl in the page's lifecycle. The 
IPageSite api includes the method registerContextMenu(String, MenuManager, 
ISelectionProvider) to allow the context menus to be registered. The class 
org.eclipse.ui.part.Page now implements IPageBookViewPage. 

i tried it in the Outliner and hit this: #7731 
Page::init(IPageSite pageSite) never called on JavaOutlinePage
I've asked Randy to look into 7731
please see annotation in 7731. Suspicion is that the JavaOutlinePage calls 
getSite() too early.
fixed 0129
