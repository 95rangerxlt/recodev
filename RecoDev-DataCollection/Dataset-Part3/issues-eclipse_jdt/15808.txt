If a user opens a Java file from the package explorer part JDT transfers focus 
to the newly opened editor. This causes problems if the user clicks on an 
element in the "not-focued" packages view since this automatically transfers 
focus back to the opened editor.

A solution would be to not transfer focus in single click mode but I am not 
sure if this is what a user expects. Especially since clicking on a file that 
opens in an external editor transfers focus to the external editor.

This is what we have done in the Navigator and elsewhere.
When in single-click mode, it does not change focus.
See OpenFileAction.openFile.

Use OpenStrategy.activateOnOpen() rather than checking the open mode directly.
Changed our code to use OpenStrategy.activateOnOpen().
Marked PR as fixed.
