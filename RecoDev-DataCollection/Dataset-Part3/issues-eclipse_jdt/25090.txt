"As JRE Library use" is NOT documented here: 
http://dev.eclipse.org:8080/help/content/help:/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/ta
sks-12.htm

The above phrase in the Window > Preferences > Java > New Project UI does not 
mean anything to me.

Please provide a better pharse in the dialog.

Thank you,
Gary

This is not what I would consider "documentation":
From 
http://dev.eclipse.org:8080/help/content/help:/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/referenc
e/ref-preferences-new-project.htm:

"Specify which JRE library to use. 

JRE_LIB variable 
The JRE specified by the JRE_LIB variable. 
JRE container 
A JRE container."

uh?
What /is/ a "JRE container" anyway? :-)
I was unable to find this in the current preferences UI. Not sure whether this is a similar problem in whatever UI replaced this or not ("Installed JREs" maybe?). In any case, this particular problem is no longer valid.



>I was unable to find this in the current preferences UI.
This is now Java > Build Path.

Verified that the doc now has a section about this.
