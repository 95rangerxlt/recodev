JSR 335 0.6.1 Part H

"A this expression may appear in a default method body; its type is the type of the enclosing interface. Similarly, an anonymous or local class may be declared in a default method body, so the enclosing instance of an inner class may have an interface type. "

This is actually a NOP, because this is already correctly handled by the compiler.
Still corresponding tests should be added.

Released new test via commit 66fe9194782f846d946fc257cc3a475661c8281c.
