When getting code assist on a constructor I invariably accidentally pick 
the "anonymous inner type" item in the tree list. If I looked close enough I 
could probably tell the difference between that the item below it, which is 
what I really wanted. I almost never want the anonymous inner type, but I use 
code assist to find constructor args very frequently. Can I control this 
behaviour somehow?

Anonymous inner type code completion is work in progres it will be really cool 
when done and generate stubs for listeners for example.

We should change the sorting and show it after the constructor arguments.
BTW, I'm looking forward to the enhanced anonymous inner type completion, 
sounds great!!
