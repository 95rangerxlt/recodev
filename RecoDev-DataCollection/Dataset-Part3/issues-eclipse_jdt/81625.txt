A combined hover does not work correctly in JavaEditor with NLPack.
An opened hover does not display javadoc documents but sources.

In org.eclipse.jdt.ui.nl1_3.0.1/plugin_ja.properties

  sequentialHover=\u6700\u9069\u306A\u5439\u304D\u51FA\u3057

I delete this line, hover works fine.

Anything in .log?
I changed the string in my workspace and it works fine.
Can you try the following: Go to the Java editor's hover preference page and see
whether the string is visible. Then de-select the combined hover and select the
Javadoc hover. Go back to the editor and test whether it works.
I understand that combined hover displays Javadoc documents without Shift or 
Ctrl. Is it correct?
I make two screenshot. please see an attached image.

Nothing.

This is correct.

Just to confirm: when you start with the (unmodified) NL pack and de-select the
combined hover and select the Javadoc hover it works i.e. when you hover over
println you get the correct Javadoc?

thanks.

>when you start with the (unmodified) NL pack
I tested the unmodified NL pack.

>when you hover over println you get the correct Javadoc?
Yes, I got the correct Javadoc: void java.io.PrintStream#println().
Tracked this down: the problem is that we sort each plug-in's Java hover
contributions alphabetically. This causes the Javadoc hover to be in front of
the source hover for English language but is switched in other languages.

The fix is not to sort and do the contributions in XML in the correct sequence.

Notes:
1) the workaround you outlined in comment 0 does not work for me.
2) you should not apply the 3.0.x NL Pack to 3.0.

Fixed in HEAD.
