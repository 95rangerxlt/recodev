In org.eclipse.jdt.ui.wizards.NewTypeWizardPage the hook method
getTypeComment(ICompilationUnit parentCU) should be called from
createType(IProgressMonitor monitor). This is true for inner classes; but
otherwise only the new type comment template mechanism is used, without giving
getTypeComment (and thus overloading sub-classes) a chance to hook in.

(I've written a Wizard subclassing NewTypeWizardPage which provides a type
comment containing xDoclet Tags. Now only the temlate type comment is inserted
in the generated code)

Not for 2.1.

Any news on this one?
Martin, can you please comment.
Should fix that.

The old getTypeComment(ICompilationUnit parentCU) is now deprecated.
use getTypeComment(ICompilationUnit parentCU, String lineDelimiter). This method
is called  when the 'genenerate comments' preference is turned on. It only shows
up if the user uses the '$typecomment' variable in his 'new file' template.

Note that alternative way to have your comments is to reimplement
'constructCUContent'. This works also with the 2.1 code. The code templates are
API.
