Create a Dynamic Web project later,I'd added a package into this project,then,the icon of package was folder icon(In fact, the  icon should be package icon),and I added a class file into this package. The problem was coming,when build project ,it couldn't  generated the file of class. But,when the icon was package icon,it could generated the file of class. I do not know how matter,please give advice to me.
Thanks!

Hi, Xiaochun.  Please start by posting your question to the eclipse.webtools news forum.  People there can help you understand how to use Eclipse and determine what you may be doing wrong; or if there is actually a bug, they can help you to report the bug against the correct category and provide all the information needed to reproduce and debug it.

You may also find it useful to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html - it has a lot of tips on how to get good help from the forums.

Thanks!
