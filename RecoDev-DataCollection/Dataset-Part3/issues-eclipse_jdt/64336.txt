Like bug 64310, this one will require a number a new methods for creating:
- type variable signatures given a type variable name
- type argument signatures given an optional type signature and wildcarding
- class type signatures with type arguments, an identifier, and an optional 
qualifier type signature

Old support need to be replaced. Will release improvement in 1.5 stream only. 
Still need some tuning to handle member parameterized types.
Support added in 1.5 branch.
