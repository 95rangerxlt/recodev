Build 20011115

If I have code like:

Iterator iter = new ArrayList().iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()){
  Object element = iter.next<CODEASSIST HERE>Element();

}

And perform codeassist where indicated, then #next() is available.
If choosing it, then nothing happens, my insertion is discarded.

since we are not using the eating code assist mode this is the expected 
behaviour. We will be looking into a spring loaded mode for enabling the eating 
code assist.
OK to close?
closing - works as expected
It should still insert the trailing '()' when I pick #next() proposal.
moving to JDT text
This has been fixed quite a while ago.
