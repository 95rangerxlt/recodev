Build ID: M20080221-1800

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Write a class containing a double field initialized with a hexadecimal literal (see "More information" for a short example.)
2. Select the field to rename.
3. An "Operation unavailable on the current selection" warning will pop up.


More information:
Note that the rename does not work inline. It works when done in the "Outline" view, but then only for members of a class, not for local vars.

A short sample. 

class A {
    double d = 0x1.2edc82110c2fap900;
}

Move to JDT/UI
This got fixed for 3.4.
