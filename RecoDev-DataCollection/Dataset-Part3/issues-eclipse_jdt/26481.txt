When I try to create a new Working Set in 2.1 M2, as soon as I expand a project 
in the tree view, my CPU is pegged for ~1minute.  Typing in the "Name" box is 
incredibly slow.  In short, it is nearly unuseable because it is so slow too 
respond.

Win NT, 512MB, ~2400 classes in workspace (split evenly over 2 projects).

Expanding jdt.ui taks on the order of 10s.
