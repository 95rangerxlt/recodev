IBuild 20030129

Create the following example and push up both members:

package p1;

public class Base {

}


package p1;

public class Derived extends Base {
	public int field;
	public void foo() { 
	}
}


On the preview page expand the node Derived and the type node. There is only 
one field node with a subnode Pull up class members. Clicking on the node 
claims that there is no preview.

can't reproduce - mine shows preview
Sorry I am unsing I20030129 + the latest from the repository. Derived looks 
like this

package p1;

public class Derived extends Base {
	public static int value= 10;
	public int field;
	public static void bar() {
	}
	public void foo() { 
	}
}


and I am trying to push up field and foo.
yup, now i see it
strange, looks like the preview page cannot eat all possible edits 
(these are created by the rewriter, not sure what i can do here)
edits are created by ASTRewrite and presented by the preview page
the refactoring code is not guilty here i guess
Not critical for 2.1
Postpone > 2.1
Reopening...
Got addressed for 2.1
