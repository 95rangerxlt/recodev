Build 20020514

Trying to open a hierarchy on java.util.HashMap, the hierarchy was built but 
the editor never opened as it was in an infinite loop in JavaCore.isReferencedBy
(...).

Note that there is no visible marker associated with this class or any in its 
hierarchy.

Indeed this code can enter an infinite loop. Fixed, patch released on Jdt/Core 
resource dev page.

Surprisingly, this defect doesn't show up all times. Scenario should be anytime 
placing a breakpoint on a toplevel classfile.
