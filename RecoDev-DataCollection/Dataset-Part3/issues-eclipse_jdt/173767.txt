3.3M5 I20070209-1006

Some examples I've spotted of when content assist offers too few suggestions.  In the following | represents the cursor at the point when Ctrl-Alt-SHIFT is pressed.

Main template not proposed:
  public class Two{m|}
(works if a space is inserted before 'm')

Sysout template not proposed:
  public class Two{void m(){int a=1;syso|}}
(works if a space is inserted before 'syso')

No proposals:
  public class Two{void m(){|}}
  public class Two{String s="s";void m(){|}}
(works in both cases if a space is inserted before the cursor)
