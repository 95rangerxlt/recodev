Open a text editor
 -> The Edit menu contains the submenu "Convert Line Delimiters".

Open a java source editor
 -> "Convert Line Delimiters" does not appear in the Edit menu.
 -> The Source menu contains the submenu "Convert Line Delimiters".

This is an inconsistent presentation.  All other edit menu actions that are 
present for text files are also present for java files.

This is now in File > Convert Line Delimiters To
...and since M3 can be used on files, folders and projects (i.e. no need to open
an editor).
