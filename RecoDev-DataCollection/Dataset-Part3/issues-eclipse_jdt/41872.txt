I20030820++

- create class
class A {
	public static void bbbb(String[] args) {	
	}
}

- give focus to package explorer
- open editor an A
- change method bbbb to main

observe: the package explorer receives a selection change event (Refactor-
>Rename is disabled). Give focus to the outliner. Refactor->Rename is enabled.

I debuged it and the outliner doesn't send out a selection change even in this 
case. The outliner isn't sorted.

Happens due to optimizations in OutlineViewer when processing deltas.
This bug has been there since 2.1.

Fixed.
