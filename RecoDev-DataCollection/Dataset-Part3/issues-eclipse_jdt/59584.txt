Desc: This icon is used for a toggle button in the global tool bar. It is
enabled whenever a Java editor is active. If it is checked/pressed all
occurrences of the current selection in this editor are marked/highlighted in
this editor. I would suggest to put a highlighter into that icon.

For the annotation roll-over, we should have an icon for "possible breakpoint".
It would show up as a cue that the use can add a breakpoint at a given location.

Desc: Possible breakpoint location. This annotation may be displayed to indicate
that a breakpoint will be set by clicking. It should look somehow similar to
"disabled breakpoint".
