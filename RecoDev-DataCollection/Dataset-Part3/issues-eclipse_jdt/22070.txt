Outline View, Status Bar and virtually every JavaElement renderer display a 
colon between field name and field type (and between method name and return 
type as well). Code Assist omits the colon and appends the return type directly 
after the element name. Example:
Outline:     "setFocus() : void"
Code Assist: "setFocus()  void - DefiningClass"

I suggest adapting Code Assist and retaining the behaviour of the Outline View.

and it should honor the appearance preferences:
Window > Preferences > Java > Appearance

adding pseudo keyword

I don't think so. That preference is there to save real estate in viewers, but that's not a problem in content assist.

Martin has fixed this in HEAD of CompletionProposalLabelProvider.

Agree.
