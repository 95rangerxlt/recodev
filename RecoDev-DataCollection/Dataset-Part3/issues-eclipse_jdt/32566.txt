After i downloaded the 200302211557 build my warning tasks disappear. Now I 
only have "Task Tag" items remaining. If I create a new method with unused 
parameters the task does show up. But in the already existing classes in my 
project the unused parameters do not show. I tried switching those compiler 
settings off in to no avail. I tried rebuilding the project no tasks show. I 
tried deleting the project (without deleting the files of that project) and 
then recreating it no tasks show!

This works for me using RC1. Some questions:

Have you set any special filters ? If you open the file, do the warnings show 
up as annotations in the editor ? Do you have a small reproducable case ?
I belive that eclipse has been enhanced to detect the use of adapters and not 
report the parameters there as unused! If this is infact true can you please 
explain exactly what feature has allowed this?

e.g:

interface X
{
  method m1(String p1);
  method m2(String p2);
}

class XAdaptor
{
  method m1(String p1) <--not reported as unused
  {
  }
  method m2(String p2) <--not reported as unused
  {
  }
}
I forgot to mention that in the above example XAdapter implements X
This enhancement was documented in JDT/Core buildnotes (also see bug 25204 and 
bug 27251):

Unused parameter diagnosis will now ignore parameters in an abstract method, a 
main method, an implementation of an abstract method or a method overriding a 
concrete one. Additional settings got added for enabling the diagnosis of the 
latter two scenarii. 
* COMPILER / Reporting Unused Parameter if Implementing Abstract Method
*    When enabled, the compiler will signal unused parameters in abstract 
method implementations.
*    The severity of the problem is controlled with 
option "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedParameter".
*     - option 
id:         "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedParameterWhenImplementi
ngAbstract"
*     - possible values:   { "enabled", "disabled" }
*     - default:           "disabled"
*
* COMPILER / Reporting Unused Parameter if Overriding Concrete Method
*    When enabled, the compiler will signal unused parameters in methods 
overriding concrete ones.
*    The severity of the problem is controlled with 
option "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedParameter".
*     - option 
id:         "org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedParameterWhenOverriding
Concrete"
*     - possible values:   { "enabled", "disabled" }
*     - default:           "disabled"

As you can see the JDT/Core is configurable, but unfortunately JDT/UI doesn't 
surface these settings (yet).

Until it occurs, you may manually add the following 2 lines to 
<workspace>/.metadata/.plugins\org.eclipse.jdt.core/pref_store.ini

org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedParameterWhenOverridingConcrete=enab
led
org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.unusedParameterWhenImplementingAbstract=en
abled

Make sure to exit before you modify it manually.

Back to JDT/UI which should consider surfacing these settings.
changed summary
No plans to expose the settings for 2.1. We are working on RC2 and only 
critical bugs will be fixed.
this seems to have been fixed in the latest integration build. Is this a 
duplicate of something?
Reopening...
This got addressed by the reowrk of the compiler preference page. Thanks for 
letting us know.
