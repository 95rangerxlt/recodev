I have a vector with type of an inner class, Mixer.Info in my case.

When I have the completion wizard generate a for loop for this,
choosing "iterate over array w/ temporary variable", the
variable is named "mixer.Info" by the wizard, which of course
isn't a valid variable name in Java.

I'll enclose a screen shot demonstrating the problem.

opt for no action for F3 since the user can easily fix this problem by editing 
the wrong variable name. Should fix after 2.0

This works for me in 3.2RC7, except for that used types are not automatically imported. See bug 29066 for import handling.
