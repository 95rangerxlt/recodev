1) Open a hierachy view on a type hiearchy that has a method which is overrided 
at several levels. 
2) Select the method.
3) Select other types.
4) Note that the method selection is lost.
We should try to preserve the selection (show the same method for the selected 
type whenever possible). This is a little trickier when the method list is 
showing all inherited methods but its still possible.
