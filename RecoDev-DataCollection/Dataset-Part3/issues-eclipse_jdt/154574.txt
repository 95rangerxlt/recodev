Select Java Conventions formatter profile and type:

public class Test {
    public int x() {
	if (true)
	    return 5;
	else
	    return 6;
    }
}

Select the method and press Shift-Tab. Indentation inside the method gets lost:

public class Test {
public int x() {
if (true)
    return 5;
else
    return 6;
}
}

>Select the method
I guess you meant "method body", otherwise the behavior is not reproducuible - at least not for me using R3.2 and 3.3 M1.

Shift+Tab only shifts the block to the left. No formatting is applied.
No, I didn't mean the method body, but the method itself, everything except the first and the last line of the class definition. It does happen for me consistently in 3.2.
I cannot reproduce this using plain Eclipse SDK R3.2 and 3.3M1 with a fresh workspace, a fresh Java project and your code example in the Java editor.

Please provide more detailed steps before reopening again.
Detailed reproduction sequence:
Eclipse 3.2 on Linux, but I doubt the OS matters.

1. Create a fresh workspace and a fresh Java project.
2. Change formatter profile to Java Conventions.
3. Create a class called Test
4. Select all and paste the following text.
public class Test {
    public int x() {
        if (true)
            return 5;
        else
            return 6;
    }
}
5. Replace all leading 8-character space sequences with tabs.
6. Select lines 2-7 and press Shift-Tab

The result is:
public class Test {
public int x() {
if (true)
    return 5;
else
    return 6;
}
}

instead of expected:
public class Test {
public int x() {
    if (true)
        return 5;
    else
        return 6;
    }
}

Sorry, I meant

instead of expected:
public class Test {
public int x() {
    if (true)
        return 5;
    else
        return 6;
}
}
Sorry, but works for me: the method declaration ("public int x() {" has 4 spaces as indentation and hence Shift+Tab does not move anything to the left for me.

Please attach the workspace.

By the way: please compare your comment 0 with comment 4. Which steps will be added next ;-) ?
I can reproduce now by formatting the whole file then select line 2, offset 0 to line 8, offset 0.

Happens in R3.2 and latest 3.3 build.
(In reply to comment #7)

Thanks! My sanity is back.

The code is just bogus. Same is true for the normal text editor. We need to rewrite that code.
See bug 40823 for the same problem in Text editors.
Fixed in HEAD.
