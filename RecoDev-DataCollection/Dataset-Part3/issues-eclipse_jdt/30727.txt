create a jproject
and a src folder in it
add 2 packages to it a.b and c.d
exclude c/d/ from the classpath

open the java build path dialog, select the source folders
expand the tree node
select 'Exclusion filter: /c/d/'
press 'Remove'
seems to be removed, right?

wrong.

open the dialog again - the filter for /c/d is still there
