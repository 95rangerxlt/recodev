We have 4 errors in javadoc generation for ltk.core.refactoring. References to
org.eclipse.core.commands.operations.IUndoContext cannot be resolved:
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/N20050228-0010/compilelogs/jdt.doc.isv.javadoc.txt

I guess the jars of the required org.eclipse.core.commands should be added to
the -classpath in  org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv's jdtOptions and jdtOptions.txt. If
that's the case, then we should also update the file aaa-how-to-add-things.txt
with this information.

Indeed, that is the problem.
Fixed.

Markus do you know where the aaa-how-to-add-things.txt file is ?
It's just besides the jdtOption* files in project org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv (use
Ctrl+Shift+R ;-). I believe there's a copy in the platform.doc.isv project, too.
