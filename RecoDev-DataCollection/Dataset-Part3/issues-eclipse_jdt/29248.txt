When working through 'Creating a New Class' part
of 'Getting Started',  trying QuickFix when
placing my cursor on Vector did not include 
the choice to import java.util.vector

However, if I first fixed the container error,
then the correcting the Vector error worked 
as expected.

So Quick Fix requires correcting multiple errors 
on a single line from right to left.
