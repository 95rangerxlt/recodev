Build 3.3M4

My workspace is organized in lots of working sets, e.g.

Set1
 +- Project1a
 +- Project1b

Set2
 +- Project2a  (prereqs Project1a)
 +- Project2b  (prereqs Project1b)

When searching for refs to a method defined in Project1a, but giving working set "Set2", I still see other matches in "Set1" which I did not expect.

When using the search page, some option can be set, but when using the context menu (in editor) no such option can be set.

This is expected, unless you disable "Required Projects" in the Search dialog, see bug 78416.

However, I guess the default for searching in Working Set should be to not search in required projects.

For better notification in the Search results view, see bug 153102.

This is currently not working. Even if you have uncheck "Required Projects" in Search dialog, searching for references of a type in a project still continues to report matches in required project. I've verified with a small test case in 3.3 M5 warm-up build.

I do not think as this would be a breaking change for the user regarding previous version and surely lead to unnecessary opened bug against this new behavior...

thanks
Oops, you're right, the scopes are hardcoded to include everything when invoked from the menu. So, the only workaround for now is to go via the dialog.

It's not so easy:
We defined that when a working set contains the 'project' itself, this means it contains its resources and all that is on  its classpath. Including external JARs and project references.

But I realized that adding project references is the confusing part as you already limited your scope to a certain project.
So I removed that > 20070302
I bumped into this again today using I20080330-1350. I understand that this is not easy, but I define working sets to help me narrow down interesting search results, and if the contextual menu cannot fetch matches in the working sets I ask it to (only), then it's useless for me.
Discussing the topic with Frédéric today, he told me the topic had already been raised (hence my commenting in this bug), and we agreed that a direction that might be interesting would be to get the search dialog parameters be driven into preferences, and those preferences be reused by the search menu, which would bring some consistency here (could add a 'use those parameters for this search only' check box to the search dialog to avoid changing preferences inadvertently).
Another option would be to see what would be the implications of having working sets bearing such options (this may well be over-specifying working sets for the sole purpose of search though).
Yet another option would be to add additional filters in the view, but I believe this would not cope that well with the search options still being offered in the search dialog.

We already have a sophisticated story for the Search contextual menu, which implies we are trying hard to help with it, and I wish it could make sense for my use case as well.
Please do not reopen bugs. Add a comment (not too long, please :-)) and I'll reopen if I agree. Or file a new bug.

I don't want that the search menu actions depend from the last recently used settings in the dialog.
But I'm fine to say that for search in reference in working sets we should not include requiring projects (that's what I actually intended, but I must have missed that case). Ok?

I just wanted to avoid opening a new bug for something that had already been
discussed, but I'll do as you ask next time (this is quite a topic of personal
taste and if you'd rather have me open a new bug, I have no problem with this;
understanding that this is not needed this time).

And what about the preferences way of looking at this, with an optional 'update
preferences' in the full dialog?

Better than what we have. Especially since the immediate understanding of 
'searching within a working set' implies, IMHO, 'exactly in' the said working set.
That is to say, if we only have one scenario in the contextual menu, then I'll
vote for the one you propose.

I have not thought much about the other use cases and I won't argue on them.
My take on this, in general, is that consistency should prevail. But I also 
know that I am especially bad at understanding some ergonomics subtleties, and
that nuance is needed sometimes.
