If I choose "Show selected element only", I now have to use the Outline View or 
show members in the Packages view (Which I turned off due to Enter causing 
Treeitem to expand).  The Outline view is not shown by default in the Java 
Perspective.  Also, this preference is rememeber using a "most recently closed" 
behavior, which is a separate issue.

I would like the ability to navigate to the next and previous member from the 
source editor itself using the keyboard.  I see two nice ways to do this:
1) PAGE_UP on the first line could select the previous member.  similar for 
DOWN.
2) Some other accelerator, possible one invoking a drop-down OutlineView 
similar to the drop-down folders ComboBox found in some Windows native 
dialogs.  A drop-down combo could be permanently displayed at the top of the 
editor.

Adam announced a fix for this on the mailing-list.

However, I think that if Control+Shift+UP does not recognize the Outline's 
order, this will be problematic.  Of course my source is alphabetically sorted 
already ;-)
Reviewing old bugs... The fix for this bug is in. Having it follow the actual content order of the file is the correct answer. If you want to walk through the items in the order being displayed in the outline view, click on the outline view and use up and down arrow.

Note also that, the new breadcrumbs support adds another way to navigate to other elements from within the editor.
