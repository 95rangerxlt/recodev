The Source->"Generate Getter and Setter ..." on a boolean variable prompts to
generate isMyVar() and setMyVar().  Shouldn't this generate getter and setter
methods?

I should have stated "Shouldn't this generate a getVar() method instead of a
isVar() method?".
Martin, please comment.
it is common to use 'is' for getters on boolean fields.

Maybe we should have a preference to let the user specify if 'get' is preferred.

Is this something Randy can add ?
No, the prefeence would be in jdt.core
Moving to Core for comments.
David - pls add an option for this one, default should be to use 'is..' style.
Remember to ping UI once option is available.
Since the functionality resides under the menu "Source->Generate Getter and
Setter ..." it would seem to make more sense for the default to be the creation
of a getter with "is ..." being an option.  Also, this would make the menu's
behavior consistant with the other variable types.

Please ignore this request.  I was under the assumption that struts required
getters and setters, but it appears it does use isVar() and setVar().  Thanks.
We realized that we can fix this in the UI (If we want to force to have a 'get'
we just use the name convention class but never declare that the field is boolean)
Added a new option on the code generation preference: Use 'is' for boolean getters
If disabled, 'get' is used also for boolean fields.
