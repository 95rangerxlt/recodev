On Mac OS you can open the menu of a combo box with the up or down cursor keys.
If you use code assist in the same field and try to use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through 
the code assist proposals, they don't work as expected because the underlying combo box uses the 
keys to open its own menu. As a result you get the combo menu on top of the code assist window 
(see attached screenshot).

code assist in field
Andre, do you have an idea what we can do on the Mac to support code assist in 
combo boxes ?
Talked to Markus about this: the problem is that the combo box still has the focus (to 
allow for continue typing), but that some keys (at least the up and down arrow) needs to 
be redirected to the code assist window before the combo box has a chance to process 
the itself. However, this would require a verify key event listener which SWT doesn't 
provide (yet).
I have to discuss this with Dani. The combo in the Find dialog is more or less
the same case and we have to find one solution.

... via improved VerifyKeyListener support in ComboContentAssistSubjectAdapter.

Andre, could you please verify that the problems have gone on the Mac (in the
Move Static Members Dialog):

- Content assist can be invoked via the configured eclipse key binding.

- When the proposals list is shown, ...
   - ArrowUp and ArrowDown scroll in the proposals list.
   - Tab moves focus to the proposals list.
   - Esc hides the proposals list (and a second Esc closes the dialog).

- When the proposals list is not shown, ...
   - ArrowUp and ArrowDown exhibit standard platform behavior.
