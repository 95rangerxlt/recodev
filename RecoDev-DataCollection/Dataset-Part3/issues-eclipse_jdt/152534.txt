In the APT test plug-in, MirrorTestAnnotationProcessor contains a test that counts the number of classes in java.util and asserts that it is 79.  In Java 6, there are 83 classes in java.util, so this test fails.

Also, there are now 18 interfaces, rather than the 15 that the test expects.

Heh. That'll teach me to rely on classes in rt.jar.
Test rewritten so that it looks for specific types rather than just counting the size of the returned collection.
