Proposed fix
This patch may remove the Chkpii error, but it is not correct. The string should not contain any quote, and "{...}" is illegal for MessageFormat.

I just checked the latest Chkpii v11.01, and it accepts neither of
  new {0}() '{'...}
  new {0}() '{'...'}'
  new {0}() '{...}'

I think we should revert to the original
  new {0}() '{'...}

and ask the Chkpii guys to fix the bug they introduced with v11.01.

That
  new {0}() '{...}

works is just luck, and is not documented.
I've reverted the changes and informed the chkpii provider.

Kim, you might want to wait with the upgrade to v11.01.
