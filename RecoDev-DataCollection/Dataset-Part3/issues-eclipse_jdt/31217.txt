- type this:
   int i= 1;
   if (i == 2)
      i= 3;
- insert '{' after closing parenthesis
Observe: a closing '}' is inserted after statement "i=3" 
- remove both braces
- add a line comment between if-statement and assigment
   int i= 1;
   if (i == 2)
      // a comment
      i= 3;
- insert '{' after closing parenthesis
Observe: a closing '}' is inserted before comment

It would be nice if existence of comment would not change behavior

we don't enclose simple control statements into the smart brace any longer. Use
quick fix for this. Closing.
