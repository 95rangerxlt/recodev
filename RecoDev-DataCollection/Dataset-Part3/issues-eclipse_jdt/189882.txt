TestRunnerViewPart should remove the fDirtyListener in dispose(). The DirtyListener is currently only unregistered and set to null when resource deltas occur. Therefore, TestRunnerViewPart objects can stay in memory longer than necessary (but they will be freed for garbage collection on the first resource change, so it's not a severe leak).
