Hi,

I've been using the following template for quite a while, and it no longer works
in 3.0M4.

/**
 * Commons Logging instance.
 */
private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(${enclosing_type}.class);

If I use the template now, ${enclosing_type} does not get resolved.  I have the
same problem with other templates.  It seems that none of the "Insert Variable"
fields resolve any more.
