Follow the instructions in the given page to create a test project with annotation processing enabled. Use the demo APT provided in the same page and create the following test file:

import demo.DemoAnnotation;
@DemoAnnotation(what = "spam")
public class DemoAnnotationTest {
}

With APT enabled, spam" should be reported by the APT and it is reported when the project's compliance level is set to 1.7. However, the same behavior can't be seen when the compliance of the project is set to 1.8. At this point, I don't know what is causing this and whether or not the APT is kicked of at all. Log file shows nothing.

Turns out that the compilation participants including the APT ones were filtered out for 1.8 simply because there was no code to support the new level. Patch to follow.
