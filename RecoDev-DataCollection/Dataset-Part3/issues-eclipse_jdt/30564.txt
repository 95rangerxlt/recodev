An extremely useful feature for any IDE is the ability to quickly view
the callers graph (a.k.a. who-calls database or usage information).
Basically a graph of which definitions use other definitions.  e.g., I
would like to be able to ask "which methods call method Foo.bar?",
"which methods use field Foo.bar?".  Probably the easiest way to show
this is with a standard tree widget.  In fact, you already have the
"Type Hierarchy" view, which is just a special case of who-calls, for
classes.  All you need to do is change that to Show Callers and
generalize it for methods and fields as well as classes, and you're
done.  :-)

Many apologies if you already have this somewhere, I admit to being a
newby with Eclipse and perhaps I didn't look for it long enough.  I
couldn't find anything in the help or with a web search.

No, this doesn't exist yet. But you can follow a call graph using Eclipse's 
search functionality.

We should consider this for > 2.1
This got added to build I20030425.
Marking as fixed
