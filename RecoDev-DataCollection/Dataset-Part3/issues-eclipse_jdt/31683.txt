The item isn't revelead since the parent of the JAR is the Library container.
The JarPackageFragmentRoot has the project as its container and not the Library 
Container.

Workarounds:
1) add custom code the the content provider's getParent call
2) the library container returns wrappered JARPackageFragmentRoots

1) is just plain ugly
2) would be more local but could have other side effects

fixed by using workaround 1
