The new private method icon (red square with rounded angles) is too close in
shape of the new public method icon (green circle).
This is a problem for color blind persons like myself. Under some conditions
(brightness & contrast of the colors, level of color blindness), we are no able
to distinguish red and green.
Colors on computer screens can be specialy bad. The way to resolve this problem
on software is usualy to use a shape coding system in addition of the color
coding system. So color blind persons can rely on the shapes instead of having
to try to determine the color.
The old icon where perfect: a plain (green), round :), circle and a plain
(green), right angles, square.
The new icons are no so good. The square has now rounded angles, and at first
glance, this rounded square is close to a circle.

Got fixed with the new icon drop.
