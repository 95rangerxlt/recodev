Eclipse M8.

In the Java Editor:
1. Change the insert method to 'Insert' 
Obs.:  StyledText default caret is used.

2. Change Java Editor font to 'Courier New 18'
Obs.: Return to the Java Editor and note that caret height has changed to fit 
the new font.

3. Change the insert method to 'Smart Insert'
Obs.: Application replaces StyledText caret with some user-defined caret.

4. Change Java Editor font to 'Courier New 11'
Obs.: Go back to Java Editor and note that caret height was not update.
Try to swtich the insert method to 'Override' (is okay) and then to 'Insert', 
the Insert caret is a dot.

I could not verify if this bug happens in the lastest integration build cause 
of Bug#54922.

this one has been fixed for I20040406, however me might need to revisit it in
the context of bug 54922 / bidi requirements.
