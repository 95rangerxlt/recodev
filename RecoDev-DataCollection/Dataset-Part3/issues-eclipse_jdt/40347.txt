This is us. We log
- CU annotation model acts on resource changed but the working copy no longer
exists when we call reconcile() - we log that fact.
- above error is logged twice due to a bug in
AbstractMarkerAnnotationModel.handleCoreException
- we try to remember the selection using cu.getElementAt and calling reconcile()
before. We log if getElementAt fails.
