Usually the extract method wizard let's the user pick the destination type if the selected logic resides in a local anonymous class.  The choice of destination types is wrongly not offered if the selected logic resides in an initializer of the local anonymous class.

Steps To Reproduce:  Select the statement on LINE 4, and see that the extract method wizard doesn't offer a choice of destination types.

class Bug{
	Bug(){
		new Object(){{
			System.out.println();//LINE 4
			}};}}
